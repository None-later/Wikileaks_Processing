THE AMBASSADOR ASSERTS IRANIAN RATIONALE IS BASICALLY PRAGMATIC AND ASSERTS TREND WILL CONTINUE. END SUMMARY.  3.  RESPONDING TO MY EARLIER REQUEST FOR GOP THINKING ON THE MEANING OF THE APRIL 5 VISIT TO MOSCOW OF IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HOSSEIN ARDEBILI, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY APRIL 19 SUMMARIZED FOR POLCOUNSELOR AND ME A CABLE JUST RECEIVED.  WE SHOULD PROTECT THE SOURCE COMPLETELY.  THE SIGNS OF AN UPTURN ---------------------- 4.  EARLY IN 1984, THE GOI HAD INDICATED ITS INTENTION TO TRY THE TUDEH PARTY LEADERS, SENT LOW LEVEL OFFICIALS TO THE SOVIET REVOLUTIONARY DAY CELEBRATIONS, AND LIMITED SOVIET DIPLOMATS' CONTACTS.  ALL THIS LEFT THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN VOICING GLOOMY AND NEGATIVE PROGNOSIS FOR RELATIONS. - 5.  THE SOVIET PATIENCE NOW SEEMS TO BE BEARING FRUIT AS:  -- THE IRANIANS POSTPONED THE TUDEH TRIALS (IN NOVEMBER);  -- RAFSANJANI ATTENDED AND SPOKE PROFUSELY AT THE 10-DAY DAWN(SIC) CELEBRATION; AND  -- THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS STARTED TO CAST THE SOVIETS IN A MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT. MOST RECENTLY A PROMINENT COLUMNIST QUESTIONED THE GOVERNMENT'S RATIONALE FOR NOT HAVING CONSULTED WITH THE SOVIETS DURING RECENT DIPLOMATIC DEMARCHES MADE WHEN THE WAR INTENSIFIED (WHY NOT INCLUDE THE NUMBER ONE SUPERPOWER--OUR STRONG NEIGHBOR?). - WHAT IRAN WANTS --------------- 6.  IN CONTEXT OF AN INCREASINGLY COSTLY WAR, THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDES IRAN SEEKS:  -- TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, E.G., WITH POSSIBILITY OF GAS SALES TO THE SOVIETS;  -- SECURE LINES OF COMMUNICATION--THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TURKISH LOC; AND  -- ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE AIR ROUTES--THE IRAQI THREAT HAS CUT MOST OF IRAN AIR'S WESTWARD SERVICE, AND THE SOVIETS HAVE OFFERED A NEW ROUTE TO FRANKFURT VIA MOSCOW.  7.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES A NUMBER OF TANGIBLE INDICATORS ALREADY REFLECTING BENEFITS OF INCREASED ECONOMIC COOPERATION:  -- THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING BUILD POWER GENERATORS, AND SEEKING TO EXPAND THIS AREA OF COOPERATION.  -- TWO-WAY TRADE IN 1985 SHOULD EXCEED $2 BILLION.  -- A JOINT MINISTERIAL MEETING WILL BE HELD IN MAY-JUNE, AND EXPERTS WILL MEET IN MOSCOW IN MAY TO LOOK AT OTHER STEPS FOR ENHANCING ECONOMIC RELATIONS. - ARDEBILI VISIT -------------- 8.  PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SURMISES THE SOVIETS WILL HAVE REITERATED OPPOSITION TO THE WAR'S CONTINUATION. HE BELIEVES THE IRANIAN SIDE LIKELY ONLY LISTENED.  THE IRANIANS WOULD HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOVIET ARMS SUPPLIES TO IRAQ--WHETHER SOVIETS TAKE NOTE WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON SOVIET PERCEPTIONS OF IRAN'S POST-WAR INTENTIONS.  THE SOVIETS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SEE IRAN TOO STRONG.  9.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES THESE CURRENT MOVES AS A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE.  IRAN FEELS INCREASINGLY ISOLATED.  ITS REMAINING ARAB SUPPORTERS, E.G., SYRIA AND LIBYA, ARE SOVIET FRIENDS.  AMBASSADOR ASSERTS MANY IRANIANS WOULD PREFER BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., BUT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY TIDE IS STILL FLOWING TOO STRONG, THE U.S. IS NOT READY FOR SUCH MOVES, AND IN ANY CASE IS TOO DISTANT.  RUSSIA ON THE OTHER HAND IS A POWERFUL NEIGHBOR WHICH CAN DO IMMEDIATE GOOD OR EVIL. - 10.  NAIK, EXTENDING THE POINT MADE ABOUT THE U.S., NOTED THAT THE IRANIAN DELEGATION AT THE RECENT ECONOMIC COOPERATION ORGANIZATION (ECO) COMMITTEE MEETINGS HAD EXPANDED THE CONSENSUS TO GET TECHNICAL COOPERATION (IF NECESSARY) FROM \"WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES.\"  PAKISTAN AND TURKEY HAD INITIALLY PROMOTED THE IDEA OF \"REST OF THE WORLD\" OUT OF CONCERN THAT IRAN WOULD BALK AT A GROUPING THAT INCLUDED THE U.S.-- INSTEAD THE IRANIANS EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR THE WESTERN COUNTRIES FORMULATION.  11.  COMMENT:  NO DOUBT THE GOP IS WATCHING THESE DEVELOPMENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.  THEY UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM BUT WOULD WELCOME U.S. MOVES TO EASE IRAN'S ISOLATION.  SHORT OF THAT THEY HOPE WE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE AS THEY WORK TO HELP KEEP IRAN FROM FALLING UNDER SUBSTANTIAL SOVIET SWAY WITH ALL THAT WOULD MEAN FOR PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.  CERTAINLY THE LONG-TERM RISKS FOR OUR INTERESTS DEMAND WE TAKE SUCH AN ATTITUDE.  HINTON " }

CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  2. SUMMARY: THE SUCCESSFUL (FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE) VISIT OF KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BOOSTED THE MORALE OF THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS HERE. APPARENTLY FLUSH WITH NEW FUNDS, THE SHIAS HAVE BEGUN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY OVER LIBYA. SUCH CAUSES EVOKE LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY, AND THE ATTITUDES OF THE SUNNI MAJORITY -- MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK UPON ANY SIGNS OF SHIA ASSERTIVENESS WITH SUSPICION AND DISTASTE -- WILL CONTINUE TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE RADICAL SHIAS TO PURSUE SPECIFICALLY SECTARIAN GOALS. HOWEVER, SHIA EXTREMISTS WILL DOUBTLESS SEEK TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FANNING ANTI-AMERICANISM AMONG THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. A HEATING UP OF THE AL QUDS EPISODE WOULD TURN ALL GROUPS AGAINST US.  END SUMMARY.  THE KHAMENEI VISIT  2. ONE WORRISOME ASPECT OF THE RECENT VISIT OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE APPARENT NEW LEASE ON LIFE IT HAS GIVEN TO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS HERE. PAKISTANI SHIAS CLEARLY VIEWED THE VISIT PRIMARILY AS A SECTARIAN ONE, AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE WENT ALL OUT TO ENSURE KHAMENEI'S WELCOME WAS A WARM ONE. HUGE THRONGS OF SHIAS WERE BUSED TO THE AIRPORTS IN LAHORE AND ISLAMABAD TO GREET KHAMENEI AND WELCOMING POSTERS SPRUNG UP IN THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE COUNTRY.  3. THE MONEY FOR THIS MAJOR EFFORT APPARENTLY CAME FROM TWO SOURCES: WEALTHY PAKISTANI SHIAS AND THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT. THE FUNDS WERE FUNNELED PRIMARILY THROUGH TWO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS, THE TEHRIK-E-NIFAZ-E- FIQH-E-JAFFRIA AND THE IMAMIA STUDENTS ORGANIZATION (ISO). THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAD BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE SECTARIAN AGITATION LAST YEAR. HOWEVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- PERHAPS INCLUDING THE FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH -- THEY HAD BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  4. IN UTILIZING THE NEW FUNDS AVAILABLE, THE EXTREMIST SHIAS ENSURED THAT KHAMENEI'S WELCOME TOOK ON A RADICAL, ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US TINGE. THE CROWDS CHANTED ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS, MANY OF THE BANNERS WERE ON AN ANTI-AMERICAN THEME, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF SHIAS AT THE DEPARTURE CEREMONY OPENLY SHOWED DISRESPECT TO PRESIDENT ZIA, SURROUNDING HIS CAR AND MAKING OBSCENE GESTURES.  RENEWED SELF-CONFIDENCE  5. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KHAMENEI VISIT, THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEAR MORE SELF-CONFIDENT THAN THEY HAVE IN MONTHS. SINCE KHAMENEI'S DEPARTURE, THE ISO HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING THE FLURRY OF ANTI-AMERICAN, PRO-LIBYAN RALLIES WHICH OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THESE RALLIES HAVE NOT STRUCK A POPULAR CHORD -- ATTENDANCE HAS ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN SMALL -- BUT THE AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT WHICH HAS GONE INTO THEM AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE POPPED UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY MAKES THIS PHENOMENON NOTEWORTHY.  LIMITS  6. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED BY TWO FACTORS: THE  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH. THE RECENT ACTIVISM OF THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEARS TO BE A MANIFESTATION NOT ONLY OF EUPHORIA FOLLOWING THE KHAMENEI VISIT, BUT ALSO OF A GREATER AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. THE MONEY BEING SPENT NOW --MUCH OF WHICH PRESUMABLY IS LEFT-OVER FROM THE VISIT -- WILL HAVE TO BE REPLENISHED IF THE SHIAS ARE TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT -- THE MOST LIKELY PAYMASTER -- WILL THEN BECOME CRUCIAL -- WILL THE IRANIANS RISK ANTAGONIZING THE GOP TO PLAY THEIR OWN SECTARIAN GAMES IN PAKISTAN?  7. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC IMBALANCE -- AND THE GROWING INTOLERANCE OF SHIA \"DEMANDS\" BY THE VAST SUNNI MAJORITY, THE SHIAS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE SUCCESSFULLY A SPECIFICALLY SHIA AGENDA. INDEED, THE LEVEL OF GRUMBLING AMONGST THE SUNNIS ABOUT THE SHIAS HAS NOTICEABLY RISEN AS A RESULT OF A PERCEPTION THAT THE SHIAS \"HIJACKED\" KHAMENEI'S VISIT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND ARE -- ONCE AGAIN -- GROWING UPPITY. PRESIDENT ZIA HIMSELF IS REPORTEDLY ENRAGED BY HIS TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF KHAMENEI'S WELL-WISHERS AND HAS TOLD THE SECURITY FORCES TO CHECK CLOSELY INTO THE OPERATIONS --AND FUNDING -- OF THE RADICAL SHIAS.  8. PRESUMABLY, A RECOGNITION THAT THEY CAN NOT AFFORD TO GO IT ALONE AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHY THE RADICAL SHIAS ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION AND IN PARTICULAR HAVE LASHED ON TO THE LIBYAN CAUSE AS TOOL FOR AMERICAN-BASHING.  9. THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THE MOVEMENT FOR THE RESTORARTION OF DEMOCRACY (MRD), HAS BEEN WILLING TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE SHIAS. IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS A NATURAL ALLIANCE OF GROUPS ON THE OUTS WITH THE PRESENT SYSTEM. FOR THE MRD, HOWEVER, THE SHIAS REPRESENT A TWO-EDGED SWORD: SHIA EXTREMISTS MIGHT HIJACK THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT MOVEMENT FOR THEIR OWN RADICAL PURPOSES, THEREBY ALIENATING MUCH OF THE MRD'S CONSTITUENCY (MANY OF WHOM ARE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE SUNNIS).  COMMENT  10.  FOR THE MOMENT, THE TACTIS OF THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEAR UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED:  THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS FAIRLY FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE, AT LEAST OVER THE SHORT TERM; AND COLONEL QADDHAFI'S CAUSE EVOKES LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY -- TOO MANY PAKISTANIS CONSIDER HIM A TERRORIST. IF, HOWEVER, AN ANTI-AMERICAN CAUSE ARISES AROUND WHICH A LARGER SECTION OF THE PAKISTANI POPULACE CAN UNITE -- AND EVENTS SUCH AS RECENTLY HAPPENED AT THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE COULD PROVE TO BE SUCH A CATALYST -- THE RADICAL SHIAS WILL NO DOUBT DO ALL THEY CAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION.

IN FURTHER DISCUSSION JULY 22, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHAHARYAR KHAN WAS WILLING TO EXPAND ON HIS INITIAL BRIEFING AND TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RAISED IN REF A.  SHAHARYAR MADE CLEAR THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON CONVERSATIONS HE HAD HAD WITH PAKISTANI EMBASSY OFFICIALS, BUSINESSMEN AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES LIVING IN TEHRAN. HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN THERE FOR ONLY FIVE DAYS AND HAD MOVED AROUND THE CITY VERY LITTLE BUT, IN GENERAL WHAT HE HAD SEEN SEEMED TO BEAR OUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD.  HE ADDED THAT THE PRIVATE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY IN TEHRAN IS LARGE, HAS PRETTY GOOD ACCESS, AND HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME.  3.  SHAHARYAR STATED THAT HIS INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GROWING DISENCHANTMENT OF THE POPULATION WERE MEANT TO ENCOMPASS THE LOWER CLASSES.  TO HIM, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING NEW ABOUT DISAFFECTION AMONG THE BOURGEOIS ELEMENT; WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE LOWER CLASSES, BOTH IN TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE ARE INVOLVED.  WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING, HE POINTED TO THE CONSCRIPTION OF 12-13 YEAR OLDS AS THE MAJOR FACTOR, WITH PARENTS NOT BEING WILLING TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A MOVE.  4.  HE HIMSELF HAD NOT BEEN OUTSIDE TEHRAN ON THIS TRIP. HOWEVER, PAKISTAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN MOVE ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER FOREIGNERS.  (AS EVIDENCE, HE RECOUNTED AN ANECDOTE IN WHICH THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON TO HIS SKIING DESTINATION AFTER HIS SCANDINAVIAN COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN TURNED BACK AT A LOCA CHECKPOINT.)  THESE PAKISTANI SOURCES ARE IN AGREEMENT, HE SAID, THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY DIS- ENCHANTED WITH THE WAR.  5.  ACCORDING TO SHAHARYAR, THE \"MODERATE\" CLERICAL GROUP IS LED BY RAFSANJANI, PRESIDENT KHAMENEI AND FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI.  HE DOUBTED THAT THEY HAD CONVEYED THEI VIEWS ON THE WAR DIRECTLY TO ANY PAKISTANI OFFICIALS BUT SAID THAT IT WAS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR IRANIAN THIRD PARTIES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VIEWS TO THE PAKISTAN EMBASSY.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE LEADERS HAD YET OPENLY DEBATED ANY DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON THE WAR WITH THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENEI NOR DID HE THINK THAT KHOMENEI WAS LIKELY TO BE PERSUADED BY SUCH A DEBATE.  AS TO ANY \"MIDDLE GROUND,\" IN SHAHARYAR'S VIEW NO ONE IN IRAN, INCLUDING KHOMENEI, WOULD SERIOUSLY HOLD OUT FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE BAATH PARTY AS A PRECONDITION FOR ENDIN THE WAR EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A PUBLIC IRANIAN DEMAND. HE RESTATED THAT WHAT THE MODERATES ARE LOOKING AT IS A SOLUTION WHICH WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE DEPARTURE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER.  6.  SHAHARYAR WAS RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO WHETHER ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER AMONG THE CLERGY IS MOVING INTO THE ASCENDANT OR ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TIME BEYOND WHICH THE PRESENT SITUATION WOULD NOT ENDURE.  HE DID SAY THAT HIS OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL PAKISTANI CONTACTS GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT ONE YEAR WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE PRESENT SITUATION COULD CONTINUE WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT DOING SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT BUT QUICKLY ADDED THAT HE HAD HEARD TOO MANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE PAST FOR HIM TO GIVE THEM MUCH CREDENCE.  7.  SHAHARYAR SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI IS ANXIOUS TO VISIT ISLAMABAD PRIOR TO THE NAM MEETING IN HARARE AND THAT DATES IN THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF AUGUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED (BUT NOT YET NAILED DOWN). ACCORDING TO HIM, THE GOI IS CONCERNED THAT IRAQ MAY BE HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN NAM CIRCLES ON A RESOLUTION THAT IRAN WOULD FIND ONESIDED AND IS ANXIOUS TO CONSULT WITH THE GOP ON THIS ISSUE.  SHAHARYAR EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO PASS ON ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE FUTURE.   MCCARTHY " }

REFTEL REQUESTS INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL'S QUESTIONS.  2.  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM:  THE GOP IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  IT DOES NOT/NOT SUPPORT, SPONSOR OR TOLERATE TERRORIST GROUPS, TACTICS, OR METHODS.  IT HAS NOT/NOT GIVEN ANY SUPPORT PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY TO A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL TERRORISTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR WITH SANCTUARIES AND TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOP DENIES THESE ACCUSATIONS.  HARD EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT BACK UP INDIA'S CHARGES IS LACKING.  3.  1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES THIS YEAR.  THE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN PRISON.  THEIR APPEALS ARE STILL PENDING IN THE COURTS.  4.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS IN 1989:  THE GOP HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY NEW MAJOR POLICY EFFORTS ON COUNTERTERRORISM IN 1989.  (THE GOP HAS CREATED THE PARAMILITARY \"SINDH FORCE\" TO HELP DEAL WITH LAW-AND-ORDER DIFFICULTIES IN SINDH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS ETHNIC COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, RATHER THAN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.)  THE GOP HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTITERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.  PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  THREE TRAINING COURSES -- EACH WITH ABOUT THIRTY PAKISTANI PARTICIPANTS -- HAVE BEEN HELD THIS YEAR IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT, AIPORT SECURITY, AND DEALING WITH EXPLOSIVES INCIDENTS.  5. GOVERNMENT RESPONSES ON TERRORISM AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES:  THERE WERE NO TERRORIST INCIDENTS AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR FACILITIES IN 1989.  THE ONE ATTACK, ON THE AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER IN ISLAMABAD ON FEBRUARY 12, IS PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS MOB VIOLENCE RATHER THAN A TERRORIST INCIDENT.  LOCAL POLICE SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE CENTER, ALTHOUGH SIX PEOPLE IN THE CROWD (NO AMERICANS) DIED FROM POLICE BULLETS AND THE BUILDING SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.   OAKLEY " }
