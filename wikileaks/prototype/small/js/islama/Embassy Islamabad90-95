REFTEL REQUESTED INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARA FIVE OF REFTEL.  2.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES THIS YEAR.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN SOVIETS ARRESTED AS A RESULT OF THE AUGUST 19, 1990, HIJACKING OF AN AEROFLOT PASSENGER AIRLINER ARE INCARCERATED IN KARACHI AWAITING TRIAL.  (THE ELEVENTH RECENTLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN PRISON.)  THREE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN PRISON.  DURING THE RECENT ELECTION CAMPAIGN, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED TO HAVE UNCOVERED A \"PLOT TO DESTABILIZE\" THE COUNTRY, CENTERED IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF SINDH, ENCOURAGED BY THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND IMPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH PAKISTAN'S AL ZULFIKAR ORGANIZATION ( A TERRORIST GROUP ACTIVE IN THE EARLY 1980S).  A NUMBER OF PAKISTANI SUSPECTS ARE IN JAIL; THE AUTHORITIES CLAIM TO HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION THROUGH CONFESSIONS OF INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  3.  EXTRADITIONS:  THERE WERE NONE; THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  4.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC (I.E., LEGAL, POLITICAL, OR PROCEDURAL) IMPEDIMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD.  5.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM AND, PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, HAS CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORIST VIOLENCE.  PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF NUMEROUS TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING 1990, PRIMARILY BOMBINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND AFGHAN RESISTANCE GROUPS.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN APPEARS TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INVQGATE EACH INCIDENT FULLY, RESULTS ARE HAMPERED BY THE POLICE'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES.  6.  MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT:  PAKISTAN HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY MAJOR STEPS OR DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN 1990. PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND ONE TRAINING COURSE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT WAS PROVIDED THIS YEAR TO EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTI-TERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE CENTRALIZED NATIONAL POLICE AGENCIES, AND THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED NATURE OF SENIOR LEVELS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUREAUCRACY, HAVE MADE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DIFFICULT.  SINCE THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINED GOOD AIRPORT SECURITY PROCEDURES.  7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL INSURGENTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR, INCLUDING PROVIDING OR TOLERATING SANCTUARIES AND TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN SAYS IT GIVES MORAL SUPPORT TO THE KASHMIRI INSURGENTS BUT DENIES THE INDIAN ACCUSATIONS OF TANGIBLE AID.  8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN HAS NOT GIVEN ANY PUBLIC SUPPORT TO A TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE, IT HAS NOT OFFERED ANY SUCH SUPPORT PRIVATELY EITHER.  9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989: THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INQ ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM.   OAKLEY " }

ONE MONTH AGO, THE LEADING TOPIC OF POLITICAL DISCUSSION IN MUCH OF PAKISTAN WAS THE PRIME MINISTER'S SHARIA BILL, OSTENSIBLY MEANT TO \"ISLAMIZE\" PAKISTANI LAWS, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY. DEBATE RAGED IN THE PRESS BETWEEN CRITICS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, WHO ARGUED THAT THE BILL WAS TOO WEAK, AND LIBERALS WHO PREDICTED IT WOULD--AT A MINIMUM--INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES.  DAILY EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, AND INTERVIEWS HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIONS OF COMPETING POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEADERS.  THE BILL'S INTRODUCTION INTO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON MAY 12 THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL LINE-UP, WITH THE SECULAR PDA, ANP, AND MQM ALLIED WITH THE ISLAMIST PARTIES AGAINST THE BILL.  3.  IN CONTRAST TO POPULAR EXPECTATIONS, HOWEVER, THE GENERAL PREOCCUPATION WITH SHARIA DISAPPEARED ALMOST OVERNIGHT AFTER ITS MAY 16 PASSAGE BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  SHARIA'S PASSAGE BY THE SENATE ON MAY 28 DREW LITTLE NOTICE--THE SENATE MADE NO CHANGES, ESSENTIALLY RUBBER-STAMPING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY'S DECISION.  AT THE TIME, BOTH THE PRESS AND MEMBERS OF NAWAZ'S IJI COALITION PREDICTED PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN WOULD SIGN THE BILL INTO LAW WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.  THREE WEEKS LATER, HOWEVER, SHARIA HAS LARGELY DISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC DISCUSSION.  A SURVEY OF PAKISTAN'S LEADING DAILIES FOUND NO MENTION EITHER OF PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN'S UNEXPLAINED DELAY IN SIGNING IT, OR OF HIS FINALLY SIGNING SHARIA INTO LAW ON JUNE 14.  A TRUE NON-EVENT.  4. WE BELIEVE MOST OF THIS SUDDEN DECLINE OF INTEREST IS DUE TO NAWAZ'S SUCCESS IN CREATING AN ACT THAT IS LONG ON RHETORIC BUT BRINGS NO IMMEDIATE CHANGE TO PAKISTANIS' DAILY LIVES.  WHILE THERE WAS STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR LANGUAGE THAT COULD--FOR BETTER OR WORSE--AFFECT PAKISTANI'S LIVING CONDITIONS, THE ACT WAS OF INTENSE INTEREST.  MANY LIBERALS, WOMEN AND MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES REMAIN LEARY OF THE SHARIA LEGISLATION--CITING, FOR EXAMPLE, ABUSES OF THE HADOOD (ISLAMIC PUNISHMENT) ORDINANCES UNDER GENERAL ZIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED LEGISLATION CAN BE TWISTED TO FIT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  EVEN THEY, HOWEVER, HAVE ADMITTED TO US THAT THE TEXT OF THE ACT ITSELF IS LESS AN ISSUE THAN THE DEPARTURES THIS OR A FUTURE REGIME MIGHT TAKE FROM THE LETTER OF THE LAW.  (THE PUNATIVE ARTICLES OF THE HADOOD ORDINANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ENFORCED WHILE ACCOMPANYING PROTECTIONS GIVEN WOMEN HAVE OFTEN FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE.)  CRITICS SUCH AS THE PDA'S AITZAZ AHSAN ARE, IN FACT, MORE CRITICAL OF THE BILL'S VAGUENESS--ALLOWING NEW INTERPRETATIONS \"AT WILL\"--THAN OF ANY MANDATE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE ACT.  5.  THE AMENDMENTS INSERTED INTO THE ACT DURING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATE HAVE HELPED DEFUSE THE ISSUE FOR MOST PAKISTANIS.  THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED AN AMENDMENT, JOINTLY PROPOSED BY FIVE MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES, STATING THAT \"NOTHING CONTAINED HEREUNDER SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON-MUSLIMS GUARANTEED BY OR UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.\"  SIMILARLY, NAWAZ READILY AGREED TO AN AMENDMENT STATING \"THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED (BY SHARIA).\"  A THIRD AMENDMENT, PROPOSED BY THE SECULAR ANP AS THE PRICE OF THEIR SUPPORT, STATES THAT \"NOTHING CONTAINED HERE SHALL AFFECT PAKISTAN'S EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.\"  THE INITIAL THREE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR THE ABOLITION OF INTEREST WAS REPLACING IT WITH THE VAGUE \"SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.\"  ANOTHER AMENDMENT, DEFINING THE QURAN AND SUNNAH AS THE SOURCE OF PAKISTANI LAW--RATHER THAN THE SUM TOTAL OF LAW, IN AND OF ITSELF--ESSENTIALLY BLOCKS ATTEMPTS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTION OR LEGISLATING WITH CITATIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE QURAN.  6.  COMMENT: MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED DURING THE WEEKS BETWEEN NAWAZ'S PROPOSAL OF SHARIA AND ITS PASSAGE BY PARLIAMENT WILL REMAIN HIGH ON PAKISTAN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA FOR YEARS TO COME.  IN FACT, THE BILL WAS ADVERTISED AS ONLY BEING A BROAD COMMITTMENT TO AN ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MUST LATER BE FLESHED OUT BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION DRAFTED TO CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BASIC LAW. WIDE DIFFERENCES REMAIN WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY OVER THE PROPER ROLE OF RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND SOCIETY, WITH A SMALL BUT VOCAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT STILL DETERMINED TO DICTATE ITS VIEWS TO SOCIETY AT LARGE.  SIMILARLY, A COALITION OF WOMEN'S, MINORITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS REMAIN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE ACT.  WHILE THEY TELL US THEY RECOGNIZE THE SHARIA ACT IS A FAIT ACOMPLI, THEY ARE MOBILIZING AGAINST FUTURE SHARIA-RELATED LEGISLATION. THEREFORE, WHILE THE SHARIA ACT PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI PARLIAMENT IN MAY 1991 DOES NOT, IN THE END, REPRESENT THE TYPE OF ATTACK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES MANY IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE FEARED, THE CONCERN OVER THE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL REMAIN.

CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT.  2.  SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF'S SHARIA (ISLAMIZATION) ACT, PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ONE YEAR AGO, WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY ON PAKISTANI POLITICS.  THE POORLY DRAFTED AND VAGUELY WORDED DOCUMENT PRODUCED NO DRAMATIC CHANGE IN PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE LAW, IN FACT, REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMISTS WHO HAD PROPOSED FAR MORE SWEEPING ISLAMIZATION LEGISLATION.  NONETHELESS, ALTHOUGH THE ISLAMIC RIGHT REMAINS BUT A PERIPHERAL FORCE IN PAKISTANI LEGISLATIVE POLITICS, THEIR SINGLE-MINDED PURSUIT OF THEIR GOAL OF AN ISLAMIC STATE IS INCREASINGLY SHAPING CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI CULURE.  3.  ISLAMIST ACTIVISM POSES A REAL THREAT TO PAKISTANI STABILITY AND PROGRESS.  BY PROMOTING INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS WIDENED THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS SECTS, CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT PAKISTAN, AND HAMPERED THE GOP'S ABILITY TO SET POLICY BOTH IN DOMESTIC AREAS SUCH AS FAMILY PLANNING AND ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES LIKE AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR.  4.  THEIR \"SUCCESSES,\" HOWEVER, SUCH AS THEY ARE, HAVE NOT WON THE ISLAMISTS BROAD POPULAR SUPPORT. WE ANTICIPATE NEITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN PAKISTAN NOR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  RATHER WHAT WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE IS A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S ABILITY TO USE ITS MILITANT MEMBERS TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA UNCHECKED.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------- WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON? --------------------------------  5.  WHEN THE PAKISTAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF'S SHARIA (\"ISLAMIC LAW\") BILL IN MAY 1991, THE PM'S CONFIDANTS PRIVATELY DESCRIBED IT AS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY OVER THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  BY INTRODUCING HIS OWN SHARIA BILL, NAWAZ HAD ESSENTIALLY BOTH ACCEDED TO THE ISLAMISTS' CAMPAIGN PRESSING THE GOP TO INSTITUTE ISLAMIC LAW AND DERAILED IT, BY WATERING THE LEGISLATION DOWN TO THE POINT OF MEANINGLESSNESS.  6.  THE SHARA ACT ITSELF WAS POORLY DRAFTED AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF VAGUE STATEMENTS CALLING FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF PAKISTAN INTO AN \"ISLAMIC WELFARE STATE\" AND MANDATING THAT MUSLIM CITIZENS \"ORDER THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW.\"  THE ONLY GOP ACTION ACTUALLY MANDATED IN ITS TEXT WAS THE CREATION OF COMMITTEES TO STUDY METHODS OF ISLAMIZING EDUCATION AND THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FROM THE ECONOMY.  IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER SHARIA BILLS DRAFTED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NAWAZ'S SHARIA ACT ALSO GUARANTEED THE INVIOLABILITY OF PAKISTAN'S PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTAINED LANGUAGE SAFEGUARDING THE RIGHTS OF PAKISTAN'S NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES.  ONE YEAR AFTER THE ACT'S PASSAGE, IT REMAINS ESSENTIALLY IRRELEVANT TO PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY.  THE FEARS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS, AND WOMEN'S GROUPS THAT THE ACT WOULD TRANSFORM PAKISTAN INTO A THEOCRACY, GUTTING THE ECONOMY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE PROCESS, REMAIN ESSENTIALLY UNREALIZED.  ----------------------------------- ISLAMIZATION THROUGH THE BACK DOOR? -----------------------------------  7.  MEANWHILE, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES ARE WEAKER THAN EVER WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE, AND WITH THE DEFECTION OF THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--THE LARGEST ISLAMIST PARTY--FROM NAWAZ'S RULING COALITION, THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY IS FURTHER DIMINISHED.  THE ISLAMISTS' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS TEACHERS AND LEADERS OF CONGREGATIONS GIVES THEM A READY PULPIT, HOWEVER, TO PROMOTE ISLAMIZATION AS THE ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OTHERWISE FAR FROM THE SPHERE OF RELIGION -- THE DIVISION BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, THE DECLINING ACCESS OF THE POOR TO EDUCATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, AND THE ERODING LAW-AND-ORDER SITUATION.  8.  THE ISLAMISTS' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR ABILITY TO BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITANT STUDENT SUPPORTERS OUT INTO THE STREETS AT SHORT NOTICE, HAVE LED SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OF PAKISTAN TO APPEASE THEM RATHER THAN CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY. UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS, SUCH APPEASEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF PROHIBITION, LEGISLATION DEFINING THE POLYDOX AHMEDI SECT AS \"NON-MUSLIM,\" AND THE INSTITUTION OF ISLAMIC CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR EXTRAMARITAL SEX OR OTHER \"UN-ISLAMIC\" BEHAVIOR. DESPITE NAWAZ'S SUCCESSFUL DERAILMENT OF THE MOVEMENT FOR A SHARIA BILL, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF PAKISTANI CULTURE AND SOCIETY CONTINUES TO GROW.  9.  FOR EXAMPLE, PAKISTAN'S FASTEST GROWING RELIGIOUS PARTIES -- THE ANJUMAN SEPAH-I-SAHABA PAKISTAN (ASSP) -- ACTIVELY CRUSADES FOR THE CREATION OF A SUNNI STATE, WITH SHIAS DECLARED \"NON-MUSLIM.\"  BOTH THE ASSP AND ITS PRIMARY NEMESIS THE SHIA TEHRIK-I-NIFAZ-I-FIQAH-JAFARIA (TNFJ) HAVE PROFITED BY ARTICULATING AND ENCOURAGING A GROWING STRAIN OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY WHICH IS FAR MORE WIDESPREAD, AND DANGEROUS, THAN ANY THE NATION HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED.  10.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INCREASING RELIANCE BY OFFICIALS ON \"ISLAMIC\" PROVISIONS IN THE PAKISTANI PENAL CODE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE WHICH PENALIZES BLASPHEMY IS, IN THE VIEW OF MANY OBSERVERS, INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO INTIMIDATE AND HARRASS NON-MUSLIMS.  A PENDING CASE AGAINST PROMINENT SOCIOLOGIST DR. AKHTAR HAMEED KHAN (REF B) CHARGES HIS RECENTLY-PUBLISHED CHILDREN'S STORY IS AN ALLEGORICAL SLAP AT PROPHET MOHAMMED'S FAMILY. SEVERAL CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY CHARGED IN RECENT MONTHS, USUALLY AFTER FINANCIAL OR POLITICAL DISPUTES WITH ISLAMISTS.  A CHRISTIAN TEACHER WAS KILLED IN JANUARY 1992 BY A TEENAGER WHO HAD READ AN ANONYMOUS FLYER ACCUSING THE TEACHER OF INSULTING ISLAM.  EQUALLY TROUBLING WERE THE (FORTUNATELY UNSUCCESSFUL) EFFORTS OF THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST JAMIAT ULEMA-I-ISLAM (JUI) PARTY TO PRESSURE THE BALOCHISTAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INTO DECLARING A LOCAL SECT, THE ZIKRIS, TO BE NON-MUSLIM.  A DECISION TO THAT EFFECT COULD HAVE SPARKED SERIOUS SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN THAT PROVINCE.  11.  CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI TELEVISION ALSO LARGELY REFLECTS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S IDEA OF \"ISLAMIC\" BEHAVIOR AND ITS GROWING INFLUENCE.  CNN BROADCASTS ARE HEAVILY CENSORED WITH SCENES OF WOMEN IN \"UN-ISLAMIC\" DRESS OR EVEN OF MOTHERS KISSING THEIR CHILDREN BLANKED OUT.  GUIDELINES FOR WOMEN'S DRESS IN DOMESTIC BROADCASTS WERE RECENTLY TIGHTENED, WITH WOMEN NOW REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR HEADS REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CHARACTER THEY ARE PORTRAYING. POSITIVE PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL ROLES ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  DISCUSSION OF SUCH ISSUES AS AIDS, BIRTH CONTROL, AND SEXUAL HARRASSMENT IS RARE AND GENERAL, WITH AIDS IN PARTICULAR OFTEN TIED TO \"WESTERN BEHAVIOR\" SUCH AS THE \"FREE MINGLING OF THE SEXES.\"  12.  IN YET ANOTHER AREA, EDUCATION, THE GOP HAS REGULARLY ACCEDED TO ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO INCREASE THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. LONG-STANDING LEGISLATION MANDATING ISLAMIC AND QURANIC STUDIES FOR ALL MUSLIM STUDENTS HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN REVISED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME DEDICATED TO \"ISLAMIA.\"  WHILE NON-MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE EXEMPTED FROM ISLAMIC STUDIES, ALL CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS--REGARDLESS OF FAITH--MUST PASS ORAL AND WRITTEN EXAMS ON ISLAMIC STUDIES.  THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO THIS SECTION WITHIN THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM HAS, MOREOVER, BEEN RAISED TO THE POINT THAT MUSLIM CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS HAVE COMPLAINED TO US THAT ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.  13.  THE GOP IS ALSO UNDER GROWING ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO ADD RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION TO THE INFORMATION INCLUDED ON CITIZENS' NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS, WHICH MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE A PAKISTANI CAN LEGALLY VOTE, APPLY FOR A JOB, BE ADMITTED TO UNIVERSITY, OR ENTER MILITARY SERVICE.  --------------------------------------------- -- DEMOCRACY CHALLENGED: THEOCRATIC PRIMACY AHEAD? --------------------------------------------- --  14.  CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MODERNIST AND ISLAMIST OUTLOOKS HAS BEEN SHARPEST IN REACTION TO THE FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT'S INCREASED ACTIVISM. GENERAL ZIA CREATED THE SHARIAT COURT IN 1980 TO BOLSTER HIS ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, APPOINTING AND FIRING JUDGES AT WILL TO ENSURE FAVORABLE VERDICTS. SINCE ZIA'S DEATH, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS BEEN STEERING A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE GOP.  RULINGS SINCE JUNE 1990 INCLUDE: JUDGMENTS REPLACING CIVIL PENAL CODES WITH AN \"ISLAMIC\" SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENTS; A NOVEMBER 1991 SHARIAT COURT RULING DEFINING ALL INTEREST PAYMENTS AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND A MAY 1992 RULING UNDERCUTTING THE PROTECTIONS IN THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY FEATURE OF THE SHARIA ACT AND A CHECK ON ISLAMIST EFFORTS TO SUBORDINATE THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO THE MULLAHS.  THE GOP REPORTEDLY HAS NO INTENTION OF IMPLEMENTING THESE JUDGMENTS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN FROZEN IN AN APPELLATE COURT.  TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT HAS ALSO AVOIDED ANY ATTEMPT TO REIN IN THE SHARIAT COURT.  15.  MOST DISTURBING TO OBSERVERS, BUT SO FAR UNDERPLAYED BY THE GOP, IS THE SHARIAT COURT'S CHALLENGE TO PAKISTAN'S CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  TECHNICALLY, THE COURT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED FROM TOUCHING CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND COURT OFFICIALS ASSURE US THEY HAVE NO INTENTION TO DO SO UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE.  THE SHARIAT COURT'S ASSERTIONS IN RECENT RULINGS, HOWEVER, THAT MAN-MADE DOCUMENTS OR HUMANLY-ELECTED PARLIAMENTS MUST BE SUBORDINATE TO ISLAMIC LAW--AS INTERPRETED BY THE SHARIAT COURT-- IMPLY JUST SUCH A WEAKENING OF THE CONSTITUTION'S INVIOLABILITY.  DURING A RECENT ISLAMABAD SEMINAR ON ISLAMIZATION, RETIRED LAHORE HIGH COURT JUDGE JAVED IQBAL DEFINED THE BASIC QUESTION AS ONE OF POWER. \"WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OR JUDGES APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT?\"  IN IQBAL'S VIEW, PAKISTAN NOW HAS TWO INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEMS IN OPERATION, ONE DEMOCRATIC AND ONE THEOCRATIC, NEITHER ONE OF WHICH CAN WORK UNTIL THE GOP CHOOSES BETWEEN THEM.  ------- COMMENT -------  16.  THE PRIMARY DANGER THAT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT REPRESENTS TO PAKISTAN IS THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES FUEL THE FRAGMENTATION OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE TIES THAT BIND TOGETHER PAKISTAN'S MANY ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED TO SOME DEGREE.  TOGETHER WITH MILITANT ETHNIC NATIONALIST GROUPS, THE ISLAMIST PARTIES FURTHER SPLINTER SOCIETY BY FEEDING THE PERCEPTION WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY THAT IT IS UNDER SEIGE.  BATTLES BETWEEN SECTARIAN GROUPS ARE THE MOST GRAPHIC RESULT. EQUALLY, THE ISLAMISTS POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO PAKISTAN'S LONG-TERM INTERESTS, AS FEAR OF PROVOKING THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS CONSTRAINED THE THE GOP'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS KEY ISSUES -- WHETHER DOMESTIC, SUCH AS EDUCATION AND BIRTH CONTROL, OR FOREIGN, SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR.  17.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT PAKISTAN IS HEADED FOR EITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IS TOO FRAGMENTED, IDEOSYNCRATIC,  AND--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHLY CENTRALIZED JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--FAR TOO DISORGANIZED TO FORM A BROAD-BASED NATIONAL MOVEMENT.  NO GROUP HAS YET DEMONSTRATED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT AND THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS LEADERS THEMSELVES ARE POPULARLY VIEWED AS POWER-HUNGRY, CORRUPT, AND PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECTS OF ISLAM.  EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT BOOST IN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SEATS IN 1990 DUE TO THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE WINNING IJI COALITION, THE ISLAMISTS' SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE HAS DECLINED WITH EVERY NATIONAL ELECTION SINCE THE CREATION OF PAKISTAN.  18.  THEIR LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND ELECTORAL STRENGTH WILL KEEP THE ISLAMISTS FROM POSING A DIRECT POLITICAL THREAT TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. THE SYMBOLIC AND EMOTIONAL VALUE OF THE \"ISLAMIC\" CALL, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE ISLAMISTS' MORE MILITANT SUPPORTERS, MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF TROUBLE.  IN SUM, WE ANTICIPATE A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELGIOUS RIGHT'S ABILITY TO TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA UNCHECKED.  19.  THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MISSION REPORTING PLAN.   PLATT " }

REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  2.  A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP IN 1994 ARRESTED SEVERAL DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF BOMBINGS OR OTHER INTERNAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  WHILE THE GOP OFTEN CLAIMED THAT THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WAS BEHIND THE ATTACKS AND SOMETIMES LABELS THEM AS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, THE GOP HAS NOT YET PROVIDED COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF INTERNATIONAL LINKS.  WE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY PAKISTANI SECTARIAN ORGANIZATIONS OR CRIMINAL ELEMENTS.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  3.  B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT IN 1994.  THE TREATY WAS DIRECTED AT EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS LIVING IN THE TRIBAL AREAS OF PAKISTAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE WANTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES IN EGYPT.  THE TREATY HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO FORCE, AND THEREFORE THE GOP HAS NOT YET CARRIED OUT ANY EXTRADITIONS.  4.  C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION/EXTRADITION.  THE \"TRIBAL AREAS\" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT UNDER THE COMPLETE LEGAL OR PRACTICAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOP.  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR GOP AUTHORITIES TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE AREAS.  ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, PROVINCIAL POLICE HAVE THE PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  MANY OF THESE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT VIGOROUS ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.  5.  D.  OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO TERRORISM  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED FULLY IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING AND IN TRYING TO APPREHEND ONE OF THE SUSPECTED PARTICIPANTS IN THE BOMBING, RAMZI AHMED YOUSEF, WHO IS THOUGHT TO BE IN PAKISTAN.  6.  E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1994  THE GOP, ACTING ON THE REQUEST OF SEVERAL ARAB GOVERNMENTS, DURING 1994 REFUSED TO EXTEND THE VISAS OF MANY ARABS WHO HAD FOUGHT IN THE AFGHAN WAR AND WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE TRIBAL AREAS AND PAKISTAN'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.  MANY OF THESE ARABS ARE SUSPECTED OF LINKS TO TERRORIST OR OTHER QUESTIONABLE ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.  THE GOP ALSO CLOSED DOWN SEVERAL ARAB NGO'S IT BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS COVER ORGANIZATIONS FOR ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  7.  F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA.  GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY.  8.  G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1994 IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTS, OR COUNTRIES SPONSORING TERRORISM.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PM BHUTTO, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL.  THE GOP CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPINGS IN JUNE AND OCTOBER 1994 OF FOREIGN TOURISTS BY REPUTED KASHMIRI MILITANTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND IN NEW DELHI.  9.  H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993.  WE HAVE NOTED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOP'S COOPERATION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM DURING 1994.  END OF ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  MONJO " }
