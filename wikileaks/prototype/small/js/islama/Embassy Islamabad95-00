REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  2. A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  IN NOVEMBER 1995, A KARACHI COURT CONVICTED 13 MEMBERS OF AN EXTREMIST SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP AND SENTENCED THEM TO DEATH FOR ATTACKS ON TWO SHIA MOSQUES IN KARACHI IN EARLY 1995.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS IN PAKISTAN IN 1995 ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  3. B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP ACTED SWIFTLY AND IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE USG IN FEBRUARY 1995 TO EXTRADITE TO THE U.S. SUSPECTED WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBER RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF.  INTERIOR MINISTER NASERULLAH BABAR HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXTRADITED TEN SUSPECTED EGYPTIAN TERRORISTS TO EGYPT.  4. C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS.  THE \"TRIBAL AREAS\" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN DO NOT FALL UNDER THE WRIT OF PAKISTANI LAW AND ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT.  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE GOP TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREAS.  ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, MANY POLICE OFFICIALS WITH PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.  INFLUENTIAL ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY OPPOSE GOP COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM, TERMING SUCH COOPERATION AN OPERATION AGAINST ISLAM.  5. D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION.  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN THE ONGOING USG INVESTIGATION OF THE MARCH 8, 1995 MURDER IN KARACHI OF TWO AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF THE CONSULATE GENERAL, AND ACCEPTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE INVEQEMBER 19, 1995, BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  THE GOP GRANTED A WAIVER OF SPECIALITY FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN PLOTS TO BLOW UP AIRCRAFT IN ASIA.  6. E.  CT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1995.  DURING HER TRIP TO WASHINGTON IN APRIL 1995, PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO OFFERED PAKISTAN'S FULL COOPERATION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR HAS SUBSEQUENTLY REITERATED THAT PLEDGE OF COOPERATION.  DURING 1995, GOP OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT THE GOP CLOSED DOWN SOME PAKISTANI OFFICES OF KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUPS.  7. F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA.  GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  HOWEVER, ANTI-INDIAN MILITANT GROUPS OPERATE FREELY IN PAKISTAN AND ARE PERMITTED TO RAISE FUNDS AND RECRUIT NEW CADRE.  THIS POLICY CREATES FERTILE GROUND FOR THE OPERATIONS OF OTHER MILITANT AND TERRORIST GROUPS IN PAKISTAN.  THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN KARACHI.  8. G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1995 IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR TERRORIST ACTS.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND PRESIDENT FAROOQ LEGHARI, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED TERRORISM IN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. CONSULATE GENERAL EMPLOYEES IN KARACHI, THE KIDNAPPING OF FOREIGN TOURISTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND THE MURDER OF ONE HOSTAGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER RABIN, THE BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG OFFICE IN RIYADH, AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  9. H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1994.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOP COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY IN 1995, ALTHOUGH GOP OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED AN INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE BROWN AMENDMENT, IF/WHEN SIGNED INTO LAW, WILL PERMIT EXPANDED U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN AND MAKE COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION EASIER.

E.O. 12958:  DECL: 7/14/06 TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PINR, PK, IZ, LY, SA, IR SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN, ISLAMIC TERROR AND HUA  1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR., AMBASSADOR. REASON:  1.5 (B), (C) AND (D).  2.  (S) DURING THE COURSE OF FRANK WISNER'S AND MY LUNCHEON WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ON JULY 12, SHE NOTED THAT SHE WAS PICKING UP DISTURBING INTELLIGENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF RELIGIOUS MADRASSAS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING YOUTH TRAINING CAMPS WHICH COULD BE SPAWNING TERRORISM.  THE MOST RECENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE ARE FUNDED FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  SHE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS PRIVATE SAUDI FINANCE INVOLVED, BUT SHE HAS DIRECTED THAT THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT BE APPROACHED.  3.  (S) IN THIS CONTEXT SHE EXPRESSED ONCE AGAIN HER SYMPATHY FOR THE KILLING OF THE 19 AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ASKED THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HER IN IDENTIFYING ANY LINES WHICH CONNECT WHAT IS GOING ON IN PAKISTAN TO OTHER TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  I UNDERTOOK TO DO SO AND ASKED THAT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHARE WITH US WHATEVER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO PAKISTAN.  4.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUED, NOTING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT A NEW ONE.  THE IRANIANS, LIBYANS AND IRAQIS HAD IN THE PAST FUNDED SIMILAR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.  THE GENERAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED AT A RECENT CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER WHICH SHE HAD CHAIRED.  THE POLITICAL CONTEXT WAS WHAT SHE SAW AS A FAIRLY ELABORATE AND WELL ARTICULATED PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT INVOLVES QASI HUSSEIN AHMED, AMIR OF THE JAMIAT-I-ISLAMI, BUT ONE OF THE GUIDING FORCES WAS FORMER ISI DIRECTOR HAMID GUL.  THE MECHANISM ENVISAGED WAS TO BEGIN WITH OPPOSITION TO THE BUDGET AND CONSTRUCT AN EVER-BROADENING POLITICAL MOVEMENT WITH DEMANDS FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.  ELEMENTS WOULD BE THE DEMAND FOR A NEW CENSUS, DEMAND FOR A NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD, AND INVOCATION OF ARTICLE 62 OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH LIMITS CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO THOSE DEFINED AS GOOD MUSLIMS.  THE INTENTION WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE DEFINITION OF A GOOD MUSLIM ONLY TO GRADUATES OF MADRASSAS OR ISLAMIC UNIVERSITIES.  THE PRIME MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS CATCHING ON.  AS SHE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE SIMPLY THE PASSIVE OBJECT OF SUCH A CAMPAIGN BUT WAS OBLIGED TO REACT AND BE ACTIVE IN ITS OWN DEFENSE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY.  5.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN TO THE VEXING ISSUE OF THE HUA.  I BEGAN BY THANKING HER FOR HER VERY FIRM COMMENTS IN HER MEETING WITH THE SPOUSES OF THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  I RECALLED IN PARTICULAR HER REQUEST THAT WE BRING TO HER ATTENTION ANY SOLID INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE THE SUSPECTS BROUGHT IN AND STRONGLY INTERROGATED.  IN FACT, SHE INTERJECTED, SHE HAD ASKED MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NASEERULLAH KHAN BABAR TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE FBI ON THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  PAKISTAN ITSELF, AFTER THE MOST THOROUGH REVIEW BY ALL AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT -- INTELLIGENCE, ARMY AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES -- HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DISCOVER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HARAKAT UL ANSAR PEOPLE THAT THEY KNEW AND THE HOSTAGE TAKERS.  AT THE SAME TIME SHE RECOGNIZED THAT ALL OUTSIDE INTERLOCUTORS WERE CONVINCED THAT THERE IS SUCH A CONNECTION.  THE BRITISH HAD MADE THIS CLEAR TO THEM AND SHE ASSUMED THAT THE AMERICANS HAD THE SAME VIEW.  6.  (S) FRANK WISNER ASSURED HER THAT THAT IS THE CASE, OUTLINING BRIEFLY THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN HAND ABOUT HUA COMPLICITY IN SEVERAL KIDNAPPING EVENTS IN INDIA, INCLUDING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGE INCIDENT.  THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SHE COULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT OF HUA MIGHT BE INVOLVED, RECALLING THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ARMY PLOT OF SEPTEMBER 1995.  SHE ASKED THE FOREIGN SECRETARY TO CONTACT THE MILITARY AND ASK IF ANY OF THE HUA PLOTTERS IN THE ARMY COUP WERE AWARE OF PLANS TO TAKE HOSTAGES IN KASHMIR.  7.  (S) WISNER AND I AGREED THAT THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL.  I ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER TO DELAY TAKING ACTION WITH BABAR ABOUT THE FBI UNTIL JOHN HOLZMAN OR I HAD A CHANCE TO BRING TO HER ATTENTION INFORMATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED ON THE HOSTAGE CRISIS.

(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR TOM PRICE. REASON: 1.5 (D).  SUMMARY -------  2.  (C) MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, TOLD POLOFF AND AARMA THAT VARIOUS OPTIONS ARE BEING REVIEWED FOR THE TALIBAN'S ATTACK ON SOROBI.  ACCORDING TO JALIL, RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE \"WARM,\" BUT IRAN IS TRYING TO STIR UP TROUBLE.  JALIL ASSERTED THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME IN KANDAHAR.  HE WARNED THE UN SPECIAL MISSION THAT IT SHOULD NOT SET UP ITS MAIN OFFICE IN KABUL.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------ OPTIONS FOR SOROBI ------------------  3.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA MET WITH MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, AND COMMANDER HAJI BASHIR, A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN'S GREATER SHURA, ON SEPTEMBER 18.  MULLAH JALIL BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY STATING THAT THE TALIBAN ARE CONSIDERING VARIOUS OPTIONS ON HOW TO ATTACK SOROBI.  SOROBI IS NOW UNDER SIEGE FROM THE EAST AND THE SOUTH, HE CONTINUED, AND WILL BE UNDER SIEGE FROM THE WEST SOON.  HOWEVER, THE TALIBAN ARE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE KABUL REGIME HAS FORTIFIED THE SOROBI AREA HEAVILY WITH TANKS AND ARTILLERY, HE SAID.  THUS, THE TALIBAN ARE TAKING THEIR TIME TO DECIDE ON THEIR BATTLE PLANS.  JALIL NOTED THAT THE KEY TALIBAN DECISION-MAKERS WHO WILL DECIDE NEXT STEPS ARE MILITARY COMMANDER BORJAN, AND POLITICAL LEADERS MULLAH MOHAMMED RABBANI AND MULLAH ABDUL RAZAK.  4.  (C) HAJI BASHIR, WHO HAD RECENTLY RETURNED FROM JALALABAD, SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SEIZED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES IN THEIR TAKEOVER OF NANGARHAR PROVINCE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE TALIBAN HAD CAPTURED OVER 150 TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.  ACCORDING TO HAJI BASHIR, THE SEIZURE OF THESE ITEMS, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, MEANT THAT TALIBAN SUPPLY LINES HAD BEEN SHORTENED, AND THEY DID NOT NOW HAVE TO SEND FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FROM KANDAHAR.  HE ADDED THAT JALALABAD AIRPORT IS IN GOOD CONDITION; AN AN-32 FROM KANDAHAR ARRIVED THERE ON SEPTEMBER 17.  (NOTE:  AS REPORTED SEPTEL, JALIL AND HAJI BASHIR ALSO SAID TERRORIST TRAINING BASES IN PAKTIA PROVINCE HAD BEEN CAPTURED, ALTHOUGH THE \"ARAB\" OCCUPANTS OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED.  THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.  END NOTE.)  ----------------------------- RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM WARM... -----------------------------  5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS THAT GENERAL DOSTAM PLANS TO SEND 2,000 SOLDIERS TO KABUL TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE TALIBAN (REF B), JALIL WAS DISMISSIVE, AND EMPHATIC THAT RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE \"WARM.\"  HE SAID HE DOUBTED THAT DOSTAM WOULD EVER ENTER INTO ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMANDER MASOOD, WHOM HE DOES NOT TRUST.  JALIL ALLOWED THAT THE TALIBAN WERE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING DOSTAM'S ACTIVITIES, BUT WERE CONVINCED AS OF THIS POINT THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO TAKE ANY \"AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS\" AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  ---------------------------------------- BUT THE IRANIANS ARE STIRRING UP TROUBLE ----------------------------------------  6.  (C) HOWEVER, JALIL EVINCED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE IRANIANS WERE TRYING TO PUSH DOSTAM TOWARD AN ANTI-TALIBAN ALLIANCE WITH THE KABUL REGIME.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, JALIL SAID THE TALIBAN KNEW THAT IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ALLAHUDDIN BORUJERDI IS CURRENTLY IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF ADVOCATING SUCH AN INITIATIVE (REF A). HE DOUBTED THAT THE IRANIANS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS ENDEAVOUR, BUT THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP TRYING.  7.  (C) HAJI BASHIR RELATED THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE HAD BORDER FLARE-UPS WITH THE IRANIANS IN THE LAST MONTH. TWICE, HE ASSERTED, IRANIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ENTERED AFGHAN TERRITORY AND PROCEEDED TO THE AFGHAN BORDER TOWN OF ISLAM QALA, WHERE THEY ENCOUNTERED TALIBAN RESISTANCE. IN ONE INCIDENT, HE RECOUNTED, SIX UNIFORMED IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF AFGHANISTAN.  HAJI BASHIR SAID THE IRANIANS WERE LATER RELEASED WHEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO PREVENT SUCH INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. NONETHELESS, JALIL NOTED, TEHERAN RADIO'S PASHTU AND DARI SERVICES CONTINUED TO PRESS AN ANTI-TALIBAN MESSAGE, WHICH INCLUDED ALLEGATIONS THAT THE TALIBAN ARE WORKING FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  ------------------------- ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME -------------------------  8.  (C) JALIL SAID THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT TAKE THE SEPTEMBER 12 STATEMENT OF FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH THAT HE WAS WILLING TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN VERY SERIOUSLY.  FOR ONE THING, HE SAID THE FORMER KING IS JUST TOO OLD.  IN ADDITION, NONE OF THE FACTIONS REALLY SUPPORTED THE FORMER KING, ALTHOUGH SOME--LIKE DOSTAM--CLAIMED THAT THEY DID.  THE BASIC POINT, JALIL CONTINUED, IS THAT AS FAR AS THE TALIBAN ARE CONCERNED THEY ALREADY HAVE A LEADER, AMIR MOHAMMED OMAR, AND DO NOT NEED ANOTHER ONE.  ------------------------------- UN SPECIAL MISSION SEEN AS WEAK -------------------------------  9.  (C) JALIL WAS ALSO DISMISSIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UN SPECIAL MISSION ON AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA).  HE SAID THE NEW SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, DR, NORBERT HOLL, \"KEPT PROMISING SOLUTIONS TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT BUT FAILED TO PRODUCE ANYTHING.\"  JALIL WAS ADAMANT THAT THE TALIBAN \"WANT TO WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS,\" BUT SAID THEY SUSPECT THE UN IS \"PRO-KABUL\" AND ANTI-TALIBAN.  JALIL INVITED UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP IN JALALABAD AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, NOTING THAT THE SITUATION WAS \"SAFE\" THERE.  HE WARNED UNSMA IN THE STRONGEST TERMS NOT TO SET UP ITS AFGHAN HEADQUARTERS IN KABUL IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN \"A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION\" WITH THE TALIBAN.  POLOFF AND AARMA TOLD JALIL THAT IT WAS IN THE TALIBAN'S OWN BEST INTEREST TO ENGAGE UNSMA IN A \"COOPERATIVE SPIRIT\" SINCE IT WAS WORKING FOR PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  (COMMENT:  RECENTLY STEPHEN EVANS (PROTECT), ONE OF DR. HOLL'S ADVISERS, OPINED TO POLOFF THAT KABUL WOULD BE THE ONLY LOGICAL PLACE FOR UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP--\"JALALABAD IS NO LONGER NEUTRAL, SO ONLY THE CAPITAL REMAINS.\"  END COMMENT.)  -------------------------------- RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES --------------------------------  10.  (C) JALIL CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES BASED ON ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TWO ALSO SHARED A COMMON INTEREST IN HALTING IRANIAN \"AGGRESSION,\" AND HE URGED USG SUPPORT FOR THE TALIBAN NOW THAT THEY CONTROL TWO-THIRDS OF AFGHANISTAN.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT THE USG DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY OF THE FACTIONS, BUT RATHER SUPPORTS THE FORMATION OF A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS SPIRIT, THE USG WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE TALIBAN WHENEVER POSSIBLE, POLOFF NOTED.  ------- COMMENT -------  11.  (C) JALIL PROVIDED NO HINT THAT THE TALIBAN INTEND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH UNSMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN ADDITION, JALIL APPEARED QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN WOULD REJECT THE FORMER KING'S OFFER TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN.  THIS LEAVES ONLY A CONTINUATION OF WAR--AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM, AND JALIL PROVIDED EVERY SIGNAL THAT THE TALIBAN ARE AIMING FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT.  12.  (C) IN THE WAKE OF THE TALIBAN'S MILITARY SUCCESSES, JALIL'S REMARKS ALSO INDICATE GROWING TENSION BETWEEN KANDAHAR AND TEHRAN.  IF THE TALIBAN CARRY THEIR OFFENSIVE CLOSER TO KABUL, THIS TENSION COULD GROW.   SIMONS " }

HE NOTED THAT THE \"ARAB\" OCCUPANTS OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED, AND HE DID NOT KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.  SEPTEMBER 19 PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT 107 \"PAKISTANIS\" RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING IN THE KHOST AREA OF AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AFTER ENTERING PAKISTAN.  END SUMMARY.  3.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF AND AARMA ON SEPTEMBER 18, MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, SAID THE TALIBAN CAPTURED TRAINING CAMPS RUN BY THE HEKMATYAR AND SAYYAF FACTIONS DURING THEIR SEIZURE OF PAKTIA PROVINCE IN LATE AUGUST AND EARLY SEPTEMBER.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE CAMPS CONTAINED LARGE AMOUNTS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.  4.  (C) JALIL CLAIMED THAT ALL OF THE \"ARABS\" BEING TRAINED IN THESE CAMPS HAVE FLED TO AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE KABUL REGIME.  ASKED ABOUT THE WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN, HE RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT HE WAS NOT IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN.  5.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA URGED JALIL TO ENSURE THAT THE TALIBAN TAKES MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THESE CAMPS ARE NOT REACTIVATED AND THAT NO FORM OF \"SAFE HAVEN\" IS EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS.  IN ADDITION, POLOFF AND AARMA EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TALIBAN PUT OUT THE WORD THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN'S PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT WANTED.  JALIL REPLIED THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM IN ANY FORM AND WOULD NOT PROVIDE REFUGE TO OSAMA BIN LADEN.  6.  (C) SEPTEMBER 19 PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT \"AS MANY AS 107 PAKISTANIS WHO WERE RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING AT TWO CAMPS IN AFGHANISTAN'S KHOST PROVINCE WERE CAUGHT ON THE PAKISTAN-AFGHAN BORDER WHILE RETURNING HOME AFTER THE SEIZURE OF THEIR CAMPS BY THE TALIBAN.\" ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, THE GOP BORDER FORCES TOOK THOSE ARRESTED TO DERA ISMAIL KHAN PRISON IN NORTH WAZIRSTAN AGENCY.  7.  (C) COMMENT:  JALIL MADE ALL THE RIGHT SOUNDS CONCERNING TERRORISM, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE COUNTERTERRORISM POINTS HOME IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TALIBAN.  WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF THE PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS CITED IN PARA FIVE, BUT INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR TOLD THE DCM ON SEPTEMBER 12 THAT HE HAD ISSUED AN ORDER TO GOP BORDER FORCES TO ARREST TERRORISTS IF THEY TRIED TO ENTER PAKISTAN (REFTEL).

(C) ABDUL BAQI, AN AFGHAN BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF AND THE ASSISTANT ARMY ATTACHE (AARMA) ON OCTOBER 11 THAT FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD \"UNDER TALIBAN CONTROL.\"  BAQI SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THIS FROM A TALIBAN SOURCE IN JALALABAD \"TEN DAYS AGO\" WHO HAD \"PERSONALLY\" SEEN BIN LADEN.  BAQI ADDED THAT BIN LADEN IS BEING \"SHELTERED\" IN COMMANDER YUNIS KHALIS' COMPOUND IN JALALABAD.  KHALIS IS ALSO PROVIDING SHELTER TO A NUMBER OF OTHER \"ARABS,\" ACCORDING TO BAQI.  ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THAT BIN LADEN WAS STILL IN JALALABAD, BAQI SAID THAT HE FELT THAT HE STILL IS.  4.

IN ADDITION, POLOFF AND AARMA EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TALIBAN TELL OSAMA BIN LADEN THAT HIS PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT WANTED.  7.  (C) COMMENT:  WE CANNOT VERIFY BAQI'S ASSERTION THAT BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT BIN LADEN AND OTHER ARABS WERE SWEPT UP IN THE CONFUSION CAUSED BY THE RAPID TALIBAN ADVANCE LAST MONTH, AND ARE NOW IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN.   SIMONS " }

END SUMMARY.  OMAR MEETS BIN LADEN --------------------/  3.  (U) PAKISTANI NEWSPAPERS REPORTED ON MARCH 27 THAT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN LEADER, MET WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN, EX-SAUDI FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER OF RADICAL ISLAMIC CAUSES, IN KANDAHAR ON MARCH 25 TO INFORM HIM OF \"THE CONCERN OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES\" IN AFGHANISTAN.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, OMAR THEN TOLD BIN LADEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT USE \"AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.\"   HE ALSO REPORTEDLY TOLD BIN LADEN THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT U.S. FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED THERE.  ONE OF THE ARTICLES GOES ON TO NOTE THAT THE TALIBAN DELEGATION TO THE MARCH 23 OIC SUMMIT IN ISLAMABAD HAD MET WITH THE SAUDI DELEGATION AND BEEN INFORMED OF SAUDI CONCERNS ABOUT BIN LADEN.  EMBOFF SAYS TALIBAN HAVE NOT CHANGED POLICY ON BIN LADEN --------------------------------------------- -----------/  4.  (C) ON MARCH 27, POLOFF MET WITH TAYYAB HUSSAINI, SECOND SECRETARY AT THE TALIBAN-CONTROLLED AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, AND ASKED HIM TO COMMENT ON THE ARTICLES.  HUSSAINI, WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO TALIBAN OFFICIALS IN KANDAHAR EARLIER IN THE DAY, CONFIRMED THAT THE ARTICLES ARE ACCURATE:  \"MULLAH OMAR SUMMONED BIN LADEN FROM JALALABAD AND REQUESTED A MEETING WITH HIM IN KANDAHAR BECAUSE HE IS CONCERNED THAT BIN LADEN IS BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS.\"  HUSSAINI DID NOT DIVULGE WHAT BIN LADEN HAD SAID THAT HAD AROUSED TALIBAN CONCERN.  (NOTE:  BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS IN RECENT WEEKS IN WHICH HE ATTACKED SAUDI ARABIA AND THE U.S.)  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI WHETHER THE TALIBAN DELEGATION HAD MET WITH SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES AT THE RECENT OIC SUMMIT.  HUSSAINI REPLIED THAT MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE TALIBAN DELEGATION AND CHIEF OF THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL\" IN KABUL, HAD MET WITH A SAUDI OFFICIAL NAMED \"NAYIF,\" BUT DENIED THAT THE QUESTION OF BIN LADEN HAD BEEN RAISED.  (NOTE:  WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HUSSAINI WAS REFERRING TO NAYIF SAUD, THE SAUDI MINISTER OF INTERIOR;  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM LOCALLY WHETHER NAYIF SAUD WAS A MEMBER THE SAUDI DELEGATION.)  5.  (C) HUSSAINI ALSO TOLD US THAT NOT TOO MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO OMAR'S REMARKS; \"THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY SHIFT IN POLICY BY THE TALIBAN.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HIM (BIN LADEN) SHELTER, BUT HE MUST ABIDE BY OUR RULES.\"  (NOTE:  THE TALIBAN HAVE TOLD EMBOFFS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT BIN LADEN CAN STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN \"TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\" WHILE THERE.)  HUSSAINI ADDED THAT BIN LADEN SHOULD CONSIDER OMAR'S COMMENTS A \"WARNING.\"  MEETING WITH SAUDI DIPLOMAT ---------------------------/  6.  (C) IN A MARCH 27 MEETING WITH POLOFF, HAMZA GASSAS, A POLITICAL OFFICER AT THE SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY, STATED THAT HE IS \"UNSURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF OMAR'S COMMENTS.\"  SOME OF THE PRESS ARTICLES INDICATED THAT THE TALIBAN ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BIN LADEN, WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE, HE CONTINUED.  HOWEVER, OMAR'S COMMENTS THAT U.S. TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA WERE OF CONCERN, HE RELATED.  QUERIED WHETHER A TALIBAN DELEGATION HAD IN FACT MET WITH SAG REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MARGINS OF THE OIC SUMMIT, GASSAS RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT DID NOT THINK THAT THEY HAD MET WITH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHO HEADED THE SAUDI DELEGATION.  GASSAS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER NAYIF SAUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION, AND CONCLUDED BY PROMISING TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE FURTHER.  COMMENT -------/  7.  (C) BASED ON HUSSAINI'S COMMENTS AND THE PRESS REPORTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT BIN LADEN'S RECENT ACTIVITIES AND THE REACTION THEY ARE PROVOKING FROM THE SAUDIS AND/OR THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE FEELING THE HEAT ON THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY FROM THE SAUDIS, AS SOME OF THE PRESS STORIES HERE SUGGEST.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROBE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEARN WHO SAID WHAT TO WHOM ON THIS ISSUE.   SIMONS " }

(U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN C. HOLZMAN, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION. REASON:  1.5 (C) (D).  2.  (U) THIS CABLE WAS COORDINATED WITH CONSULATE PESHAWAR.  ------- SUMMARY -------  3.  (C) NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER.  HE COMES FROM A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KANDAHAR AND HIS FAMILY, WHILE RESPECTED, DID NOT BELONG TO THE AFGHAN ELITE.  A SMALL-TIME COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE, HE FORMED THE TALIBAN IN LATE 1994 AS A REACTION AGAINST \"IMMORAL\" LOCAL COMMANDERS.  HE RARELY APPEARS IN PUBLIC AND DOES NOT MEET WITH MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  THOSE WHO HAVE MET HIM SAY HE IS A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND LIVES IN SPARTAN SURROUNDINGS.   ALTHOUGH HIS POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE, MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT OMAR PLAYS THE KEY, AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- NOT MUCH BIO-DATA -----------------  4.  (C) SHORTLY AFTER THE TALIBAN SEIZED KABUL IN SEPTEMBER 1996, THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT ANNOUNCED THAT MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER, WOULD SERVE AS THE HEAD OF THEIR \"ISLAMIC STATE OF AFGHANISTAN.\"  IN THIS CAPACITY, HIS TITLE REMAINS \"AMIR AL-MU'MININ\" (\"COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL\"), WHICH A TALIBAN-CONVENED GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONFERRED ON HIM IN APRIL 1996 IN KANDAHAR CITY.  OMAR, WHO IS APPROXIMATELY 38, IS FROM THE MAIWAND DISTRICT OF KANDAHAR PROVINCE AND IS A MEMBER OF THE HOTAK SUB-TRIBE OF THE GHILZAI TRIBE (REF C).  OMAR WAS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR, WHO MAINTAINED AFFILIATIONS WITH HEZB-I-ISLAMI (KHALIS) AND HARAKAT-I- INQILAB-ISLAMI (MOHAMMEDI).  HE LOST HIS RIGHT EYE IN THE WAR. AFTER THE FALL OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN 1992, OMAR, WHO REPORTEDLY HAS TWO WIVES, RETURNED TO A MADRASSA, WHICH HE HAD ATTENDED IN HIS YOUTH, IN HIS HOME VILLAGE OF SANGASAR, NEAR KANDAHAR CITY.  IT WAS FROM THIS VILLAGE THAT MULLAH OMAR AND FELLOW TALIBS, ANGERED ABOUT THE \"IMMORAL BEHAVIOR\" OF LOCAL COMMANDERS, BEGAN THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT IN THE FALL OF 1994.  5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT OMAR'S BACKGROUND, HAMID KARZAI, THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE LARGE POPALZAI TRIBE, TOLD POLOFF MARCH 22 THAT OMAR CAME FROM A FAMILY LOCALLY RESPECTED FOR ITS RELIGIOUS PIETY, BUT NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS:  \"OMAR'S FATHER WAS A LOCAL RELIGIOUS LEADER, BUT THE FAMILY WAS POOR AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO POLITICAL LINKS IN KANDAHAR OR KABUL.  THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AFGHANS AND WERE DEFINITELY NOT MEMBERS OF THE ELITE.\" AGREEING WITH KARZAI'S ASSESSMENT, HAMED GAILANI, SON OF PIR GAILANI AND A LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OF AFGHANISTAN (NIFA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT \"OMAR IS ADMIRED BY THE TALIBAN FOR THREE REASONS:  HIS RELIGIOUS PIETY, HIS REPUTATION FOR INCORRUPTIBILITY, AND HIS BRAVERY IN THE JIHAD.  BECAUSE OF THESE QUALITIES, HE IS CONSIDERED LIKE A TEACHER, A GUIDE.\"  ---------------------- FEW PUBLIC APPEARANCES ----------------------  6.  (C) MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR IS RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC.  ONE OF THE FEW TIMES HE HAS MADE A PUBLIC APPEARANCE WAS IN APRIL, 1996, WHEN HE ACCEPTED THE AMIR AL-MU'MININ TITLE AND HELD THE \"CLOAK OF THE PROPHET\" (A KANDAHARI RELIC) IN FRONT OF A CROWD.  HE ALSO PERSONALLY INAUGURATED A TALIBAN-SPONSORED REFURBISHMENT OF THE MAUSOLEUM OF AHMAD SHAH DURRANI IN KANDAHAR.  WHETHER HE CHOOSES TO REMAIN SHROUDED IN SECRECY OR IS A GENUINE RECLUSE IS NOT CLEAR, BUT MULLAH MALANG, A FORMER RESISTANCE COMMANDER WHO KNOWS MANY OF THE TALIBAN LEADERS, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 26 THAT MULLAH OMAR HAS NO DESIRE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC PERSONALITY:  \"WHAT YOU MUST REALIZE IS THAT OMAR IS TOTALLY INNER-DIRECTED.  HIS LEGITIMACY COMES FROM GOD AND NOT FROM THE PUBLIC; BECAUSE OF THIS, HE FEELS NO NEED TO EMERGE FROM HIS CHAMBERS. IN ADDITION, HE DOES NOT WANT TO MEET ANYONE WHO MAY DIVERT HIM FROM HIS CHOSEN COURSE.\"  -------------------------------- A RELUCTANCE TO MEET NON-MUSLIMS --------------------------------  7.  (C) MALANG'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO GET TO KNOW MULLAH OMAR:  HE DOES NOT MEET MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HE HAS MET WITH NON-MUSLIMS ONLY TWO TIMES:  HE MET UNICEF AFGHAN REPRESENTATIVE JIM MOHAN IN 1996 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AND AGAIN IN 1996 HE MET (BRIEFLY) WITH A RUSSIAN DELEGATION SEEKING THE RELEASE OF MEMBERS OF A RUSSIAN AIRCREW WHICH WAS CAPTURED AND DETAINED BY THE TALIBAN FROM 1995 TO 1996. FRANCIS OKELO, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE UN SPECIAL MISSION FOR AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 21 THAT UN SPECIAL ENVOY HOLL (A NON-MUSLIM GERMAN) HAS REQUESTED MEETINGS WITH OMAR ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND BEEN TURNED DOWN EVERY TIME.  ASKED WHETHER THE UNSMA HAD EVER RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TALIBAN, OKELO REPLIED THAT \"THEY BASICALLY TELL US THAT HE IS ALWAYS BUSY AND INTIMATE THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE TO MEET WITH NON-MUSLIMS.\"  IN ADDITION, UNOCHA COORDINATOR ALFREDO WITSCHI-CESTARI (A NON-MUSLIM) RECENTLY EXPRESSED OPTIMISM TO THE DCM THAT HIS REQUEST TO MEET WITH OMAR IN KANDAHAR TO EXPLAIN UN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/ DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD BE GRANTED.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.)  ------------------ A MAN OF FEW WORDS ------------------  8.  (C) THOSE WHO HAVE MET MULLAH OMAR REMARK THAT HE IS A MAN OF DECIDEDLY FEW WORDS, AND ONE WHO KEEPS TO SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS.  ON MARCH 21, IBRAHIM BAKR, THE OIC SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN, TOLD DCM THAT HE HAD MET OMAR ON MARCH 15 TO REQUEST LENIENCE FOR TWO JAILED FRENCHMEN HELD IN KABUL BY THE TALIBAN ON VAGUE CHARGES OF IMMORALITY.  (NOTE:  AFTER A BRIEF TRIAL, THE FRENCHMEN WERE RELEASED ON MARCH 19.)  BAKR DESCRIBED THE MEETING:  \"I EXPLAINED WHY I THOUGHT THE FRENCHMEN SHOULD BE RELEASED AND AT THE END OF MY COMMENTS MULLAH OMAR SAID 'THANK YOU.  WE WILL CONSIDER THAT.'\" BAKR ADDED THAT OMAR'S OFFICE (WHICH APPARENTLY DOUBLED AS HIS BEDROOM) WAS SPARSE AND DIMLY LIT.  THE ONLY FURNITURE WAS A CHARPOY (SIMPLE WOODEN BED) AND A WARDROBE.  GUESTS SAT ON THE FLOOR, LOOKING UP AT OMAR, WHO SAT ON THE CHARPOY.  ANOTHER PERSON WHO MET OMAR, IFTIKHAR MURSHED, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (AFGHANISTAN) AT THE PAKISTANI MFA, TOLD US DECEMBER 15 THAT, DURING A DECEMBER 8 DELEGATION VISIT TO KANDAHAR, A PAKISTANI DELEGATION MET OMAR AND IN THAT MEETING \"THE PAKISTANIS SPOKE FOR THE FIRST 85 MINUTES AND OMAR FOR THE LAST FIVE.\"   IN THIS MEETING (REF B), MURSHED RECOUNTED THAT THE GIST OF OMAR'S COMMENTS WERE, \"I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE COME; I HAVE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY.\"  (NOTE:  MURSHED HAS ALSO TOLD DCM THAT THE PAKISTANI CONSUL GENERAL IN KANDAHAR HAS EASY ACCESS TO OMAR.\")  IN DESCRIBING HIS MEETING WITH OMAR, UNICEF REPRESENTATIVE MOHAN SAID HE DID ALL THE SPEAKING AND RECEIVED LITTLE REACTION FROM OMAR.  ----------------------------- POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE -----------------------------  9.  (C) THE LIMITED ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE PROVIDES LITTLE INFORMATION ON MULLAH OMAR'S PERSONAL POLITICAL BELIEFS.  MOST OBSERVERS DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN \"IKHWANI\" OR \"FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM\" IN THE CLASSIC MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SENSE.  IN A MARCH 20 CONVERSATION, DR. GHAIRAT BAHEER, THE ISLAMABAD REPRESENTATIVE FOR HEZB-I-ISLAMI AND SON-IN-LAW OF ISLAMIC RADICAL GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR, COMMENTED THAT \"OMAR IS TOO POORLY EDUCATED IN ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES TO BE AN IKHWANI; HE IS BASICALLY A FERVENT MUSLIM WITH OBSCURANTIST TENDENCIES WHOSE VIEWS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY HIS TRIBAL BACKGROUND.\"  INDEED, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT MULLAH OMAR IS AN ISLAMIC RADICAL WITH AN ANTI-WESTERN AGENDA. HE HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE ANTI-WESTERN STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH HE IS KNOWN TO BE ANTI-RUSSIAN BECAUSE OF THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR. HOWEVER, WE RECENTLY HEARD ONE COMMENT THAT INDICATES THAT OMAR MAY HAVE SOME ANTAGONISM TOWARD THE WEST:  ABDUL HADI, THE TALIBAN DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF ZABUL PROVINCE AND THEIR (SELF-DESCRIBED) CHOICE FOR GOVERNOR OF WARDAK PROVINCE, TOLD DCM ON MARCH 17 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A MEETING MARCH 1 IN WHICH OMAR HAD DEFENDED THE TALIBAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN -- \"OMAR TOLD US THAT WE HAVE TO HELP BIN LADEN BECAUSE HE IS A GOOD, ISLAMIC PERSON, WHO IS FIGHTING THE KAFFIRS (UNBELIEVERS).\"  (NOTE:  SEE REF A ON A MARCH 25 MEETING BETWEEN OMAR AND FUGITIVE EX-SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.)  -------------------------------------------- TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING:  OMAR AND THE SHURA --------------------------------------------  10.  (C) MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OMAR HAS A KEY, AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  THEY NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT VIRUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT TALIBAN EDICT ON SOCIAL ISSUES OR THE MILITARY SITUATION COMES OUT IN HIS NAME.  IN ADDITION, HE REPORTEDLY MAKES HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, A SECOND SECRETARY AT THE AFGHAN EMBASSY AND A TALIB, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 14 THAT \"THE AMIR AL-MU'MININ HAS TOTAL CONTROL OF PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  OF COURSE, HE MAKES THESE DECISIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER SHURA MEMBERS.\"  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE OF OMAR'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE SHURA.  IN RESPONSE, HUSSAINI OBSERVED THAT POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE IN KANDAHAR AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL\" IN KABUL, WHICH GIVES ORDERS TO TALIBAN PROVINCIAL CHIEFS.  SOMEWHAT CONFUSINGLY, HE THEN ADDED THAT BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS OMAR CONSULTS CLOSELY WITH MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL\" AND MULLAH HASSAN, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL.\"  (FORMER COMMANDER RAHIM WARDAK, IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH THE DCM, ALSO INDICATED THAT OMAR CONSULTS WIDELY AMONG SENIOR TALIBAN OFFICIALS; HOWEVER, AFTER HEARING VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS, OMAR SOMETIMES COMES UP WITH A DECISION COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE EXPRESSED VIEWS AND THEN EXPECTS IMPLEMENTATION.  BASED ON WARDAK'S COMMENTS, ONE COULD CONCLUDE THAT OMAR WAS A BIT OF A \"CONTROL FREAK.\")  HIROSHI TAKAHASHI, AN UNSMA POLITICAL OFFICER, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 5 THAT HE THOUGHT THAT TWO OTHER KEY ADVISERS FOR OMAR ARE ANOTHER MULLAH HASSAN, THE GOVERNOR OF KANDAHAR AND FOUR NEIGHBORING PROVINCES, AND MULLAH JALIL, A TALIBAN \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER,\" WHO IS STATIONED IN KANDAHAR.  ------- COMMENT -------  11.  (C) WHILE REPORTS VARY OF HOW WILLING OR RELUCTANT MULLAH OMAR WAS TO ACCEPT THE TITLE \"AMIR AL-MU'MININ\" FROM THE ASSEMBLED TALIBAN IN KANDAHAR IN APRIL 1996, NEVERTHELESS HE DID ACCEPT IT. CREATED EARLY IN ISLAMIC HISTORY AND FIRST USED BY THE SECOND OF THE ORTHODOX CALIPHS, OMAR, THE TITLE HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY A SERIES OF MUSLIM POLITIES UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.  IN THE SUNNI ISLAMIC WORLD, THE ADOPTION OF THE TITLE IMPLIED THE CLAIM EITHER TO THE CALIPHATE OR TO AUTONOMOUS POLITICAL AUTHORITY OVER A REGION OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  NOT EVEN THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL TALIBAN CLAIM THAT OMAR WITH HIS TITLE IS A SUCCESSOR TO THE CALIPHATE, MOST RECENTLY HELD IN OTTOMAN TURKEY.  BUT, IN THE SECOND SENSE, THE TALIBAN ARE MOST CERTAINLY CLAIMING AUTHORITY OVER THE AFGHAN REGION OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  OMAR BUTTRESSED THIS CLAIM BY DISPLAYING \"THE CLOAK OF THE PROPHET\" WHEN HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF AMIR AL-MU'MININ. ALSO, IN MORE RECENT HISTORY, THE TITLE HAS HAD A STRONG IDEOLOGICAL RESONANCE AMONG SOME REFORMIST, MESSIANIC, AND MILITANT ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS, RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE CORRUPT AND IRRELIGIOUS WAYS OF THE EXISTING RULERS.  BESIDES THE TALIBAN, SOME OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON AFGHAN SOIL HAVE USED THIS TITLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A WAHHABI SECT WITH STRONG ARAB BACKING, MOST ACTIVE IN KUNAR PROVINCE, UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY CALLED ITS LEADER \"AMIR AL-MU'MININ.\"  12.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO MANY OF THE HOLDERS OF THE TITLE IN CLASSICAL ISLAM OR TO MANY OF THE LAWLESS COMMANDERS THE TALIBAN OUSTED OR COOPTED, OMAR LIVES AUSTERELY, WITHOUT AN ELABORATE COURT AND ENTOURAGE, AND WITHOUT THE UBIQUITOUS PAJERO'S SO MANY MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS SPED AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE IN.  WHETHER OMAR'S ASCETIC LIFESTYLE IS BASED SOLELY ON HIS TEMPERAMENT OR IS COLDLY CALCULATED TO SET HIM AND HIS MOVEMENT APART FROM THE DISCREDITED MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS AND LEADERS THE TALIBAN REPLACED, MANY AFGHANS REACT APPROVINGLY.  SO FAR, NO PERSONALITY CULT OR EMPEROR SYNDROME APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND MULLAH OMAR.  13.  (C) OMAR, AS REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS SUGGESTS, MAY BE ADOPTING INCREASINGLY HARDLINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE WEST AND ISSUES ABOUT WHICH THE U.S. IS CONCERNED (NARCOTICS, TERRORISM). WHAT IS MOTIVATING THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS:  GENUINE IDEOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS, A GROWING RESENTMENT THAT THE WEST HAS NOT ACCEPTED THE TALIBAN AS A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT, A BAZAAR BARGAINING ATTITUDE, FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SQUEEZES ON THE TALIBAN, OUTSIDERS' ADVICE, OR SOME OTHER FACTOR COULD ALL PLAY A ROLE.  14.  (C) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE EMBASSY HAS ASKED WHETHER A MEETING WITH OMAR MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, BUT NOTHING HAS EVER COME OF IT.  THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT U.S. VIEWS GET THROUGH TO OMAR ACCURATELY, GIVEN HIS KEY ROLE IN THE TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  AT THIS POINT, BASED ON THE TALIBAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND DETERMINATION TO END THE CONFLICT BY MILITARY MEANS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF HE IS HEARING OUR MESSAGE FROM OTHER HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN AND FROM U.S. PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HE IS NOT LISTENING TO IT.

(C) SUMMARY:  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, HAMED GAILANI, THE POLITICALLY-ACTIVE SON OF PIR GAILANI, AND MULLAH MALANG, AN AFGHAN WITH LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY THAT \"RADICALS\" ARE GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN THE TALIBAN.  THEY PICTURE THE \"RADICALS\" AS BEING STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE TALIBAN'S POLICY OF OFFERING SAFE HAVEN TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN.  THEY ADDED THAT SOME OF THE \"RADICALS,\" INCLUDING \"JUSTICE MINISTER\" TURABI AND HIGH- LEVEL TALIBAN ADVISER WAKIL AHMED, WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO MULLAH MANSOUR, A STRONGLY ISLAMIST RESISTANCE LEADER, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1992.  END SUMMARY.  \"RADICALS\" SEEN AS GAINING THE UPPER HAND -----------------------------------------/  3.  (C) IN AN APRIL 12 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, HAMED GAILANI, THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, SAID HE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF \"RADICALS\" HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  IN A SEPARATE APRIL 14 CONVERSATION, MULLAH MALANG, A COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE WITH CLOSE LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD ALSO NOTED A \"MORE EXTREME EDGE\" TO THE TALIBAN, ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST MONTH.  BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG LISTED THE FOLLOWING TALIBAN LEADERS AS \"RADICALS\" WITH INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN THE MOVEMENT:  -- MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ADVISER TO TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR. -- MULLAH TURABI, THE \"JUSTICE MINISTER.\" -- MULLAH MUTAQI, THE \"INFORMATION MINISTER.\" -- MULLAH JALIL, THE \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER\" IN KANDAHAR. -- SHER MOHAMMAD STANEKZAI, THE \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER\" IN KABUL. -- MULLAH SIDDIQI, THE \"ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE.\"  (NOTE:  SEE REF B FOR RECORD OF POLOFF'S RECENT MEETING WITH SIDDIQI, IN KABUL.)  STRONG PRO-BIN LADEN VIEWS --------------------------/  4.  (C) MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT ALL OF THESE TALIBAN OFFICIALS ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE TALIBAN'S POLICY OF PROVIDING SAFE HAVEN AND PROTECTION TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN.  IN PARTICULAR, HE NOTED, TURABI, WAKIL AHMED AND MUTAQI HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE PRO-BIN LADEN WING OF THE TALIBAN.  ON THE OTHER HAND, MALANG CONTINUED, ALTHOUGH MULLAH RABBANI, THE TALIBAN \"CHIEF OF THE CARETAKER COUNCIL,\" AND MULLAH GHAUS, THE TALIBAN \"FOREIGN MINISTER,\" ARE NOT AGAINST OFFERING HAVEN TO BIN LADEN, THEY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE TALIBAN OF BEING IDENTIFIED WITH BIN LADEN'S ANTI-SAUDI AND ANTI-AMERICAN POLICIES.  HOWEVER, MALANG ADDED, RABBANI AND GHAUS HAVE \"LOST THE ARGUMENT\" AND THE TALIBAN HAVE NO PLANS TO ADJUST THEIR POLICY ON BIN LADEN.  5.  (C) ASKED WHY BIN LADEN IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE \"RADICALS,\" MALANG REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE RADICALS SEE BIN LADEN AS A \"LEARNED MUSLIM,\" WHO CAN QUOTE FROM THE KORAN AND HADITHS (SAYINGS OF THE PROPHET).  IN ADDITION, THEY FEEL HE IS OWED RESPECT BECAUSE HE HELPED THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  FINALLY, MALANG OBSERVED, THE \"RADICALS\" ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDS THAT BIN LADEN PROVIDES THE TALIBAN.  THE \"MANSOUR\" GROUP -------------------/  6.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ASSERTED THAT MOST OF THE TALIBAN \"RADICALS\" WERE AFFILIATED WITH AN AFGHAN RESISTANCE PARTY LED BY NASRULLAH MANSOUR.  GAILANI TOLD POLOFF THAT MANSOUR WAS ORIGINALLY THE DEPUTY TO MOHAMMED NABI MOHAMMEDI, THE LEADER OF HARAKAT-I- INQILAB-I-ISLAMI (HII), BUT LEFT THE PARTY TO FORM A BREAKAWAY FACTION IN 1981.  THE ISSUE THAT LED TO THE HII SPLIT, ACCORDING TO GAILANI, WAS NABI'S BELIEF THAT MANSOUR HAD GROWN \"TOO INTERNATIONALIST\" IN HIS ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  HE NOTED THAT MANSOUR WAS ASSASSINATED BY UNITS LOYAL TO HEZB-I-ISLAMI (HEKMATYAR) IN 1992, AND ADDED THAT WAKIL AHMED, TURABI, AND SIDDIQI, IN PARTICULAR, ARE CONSIDERED \"PROTEGES OF MANSOUR.\"  \"MANSOURIS\" SEEN AS LESS ANTI-IRANIAN\" --------------------------------------/  7.  (C) NOTING THAT MANSOUR SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN IRAN IN THE 1980S, MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED \"MANSOURIS\" (AS SUPPORTERS OF MANSOUR ARE KNOWN) ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LESS ANTI-IRANIAN THAN OTHER TALIBAN.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, HE EXPLAINED THAT SINCE \"MANSOURIS\" ARE MORE ISLAMIST IN ORIENTATION AND LESS NATIONALISTIC, THEY DO NOT HOLD THE STRONG ANTI-IRANIAN BELIEFS COMMON TO OTHER AFGHANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE PASHTUNS FROM WESTERN PROVINCES LIKE KANDAHAR, HELMAND, URUZGAN, AND FARAH.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE PRO-IRANIAN, HE CONCLUDED, BUT SIMPLY THAT \"MANSOURIS\" ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO THE IRANIANS.  A TALIBAN \"REFORM COMMISSION\" -----------------------------/  8.  (C) NEITHER GAILANI NOR MALANG BELIEVED THAT THE TREND TOWARD WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE \"RADICALIZATION\" OF THE TALIBAN WOULD EBB IN THE NEAR-TERM.  BOTH NOTED THAT THAT THEY HAD HEARD THAT MULLAH TURABI WAS NAMED THE HEAD OF A \"REFORM COMMISSION\" BY TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR IN MARCH.  FROM THIS POSITION, MALANG COMMENTED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT MULLAH TURABI NOW MAINTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON PERSONNEL DECISIONS AND DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION.  IN ADDITION, SINCE IT WAS REPORTED THAT TURABI WAS CHOSEN FOR THE POST PERSONALLY BY MULLAH OMAR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE IS NOW, ALONG WITH MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ONE OF OMAR'S CLOSEST ADVISERS, HE STATED.  COMMENT -------/  9.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ARE KNOWLEGEABLE CONTACTS ON AFGHANISTAN; MALANG, IN PARTICULAR, APPEARS TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT TALIBAN PERSONALITIES AND DECISION-MAKING.  THEIR ASSERTION THAT \"RADICALS\" IN THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN GAINING INFLUENCE HAS BEEN REPEATED BY OTHER OBSERVERS, INCLUDING GENERAL PAYENDA, DOSTAM'S REPRESENTATIVE IN PAKISTAN (REF A).  BIN LADEN'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE PURPORTEDLY ASCENDANT \"RADICALS\" IS POTENTIALLY OF GREAT CONCERN, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS THAT BIN LADEN IS ABLE TO EXPAND HIS INFLUENCE ON THE TALIBAN.   SIMONS " }

TWO OF ITS MORE PROMINENT MEMBERS RECENTLY WERE ARRESTED IN NEPAL AND INDIA FOR POSSESSION OF THE EXPLOSIVE RDX, WANI SAID.

MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THE JKIF WAS SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL, BUT POL FSN FINALLY MANAGED TO TRACK DOWN AN ISLAMABAD PHONE NUMBER (445699) FOR THE GROUP.

POLOFFS WERE USHERED INTO THE HOUSE BY DR. HAIDER, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF.  HE IN TURN INTRODUCED BILAL BAIG, CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF, AND SYED ALI RAZA, WHOM HAIDER DESCRIBED AS THE PRESIDENT OF JKIF'S POLITICAL WING IN MUZAFFARABAD.  HAIDER, WHO HAILS FROM BARAMULLA DISTRICT OF INDIAN KASHMIR AND SAYS HE HAS A MEDICAL DEGREE, DID MOST OF THE TALKING DURING THE NEXT HOUR-AND- A-HALF, THOUGH RAZA DID SPEAK UP OCCASIONALLY, AND BAIG APPEARED TO BE FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION CLOSELY.  3.  (S)  HAIDER NEEDED LITTLE PROMPTING TO LAUNCH INTO A CONVOLUTED EXPLANATION OF THE GROUP'S HISTORY AND ITS PHILOSOPHY, MOST OF WHICH IS COVERED MORE COMPREHENSIBLY IN REFTELS B AND C.  HAIDER SAID THE GROUP BEGAN AS A PEACEFUL ORGANIZATION CALLED THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR STUDENTS' LIBERATION FRONT IN 1988 AND GRADUALLY METAMORPHOSED INTO THE JKIF OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  HAIDER SAID HIS OWN CONVERSION TO VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE IN APRIL 1992, WHEN HE WAS DETAINED AND TORTURED BY INDIAN TROOPS IN SRINAGAR.  ROLLING UP HIS PANTS LEG TO REVEAL SEVERAL UGLY GOUGES IN HIS SKIN, HAIDER SAID HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO ELECTRIC SHOCKS AND SEVERE BEATINGS WHILE IN CUSTODY.  SINCE THEN, HAIDER SAID, HIS ELDER BROTHER HAD BEEN KILLED AND HIS FAMILY HOME DESTROYED BY INDIAN TROOPS, WHILE HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE TO PAKISTAN IN 1994.  \"HE TOO HAS SUFFERED,\" HAIDER SAID POINTING TO BAIG, WHO WAS SITTING IMPASSIVELY ACROSS THE ROOM.  BAIG'S SISTER-IN-LAW AND FATHER WERE KILLED BY INDIAN TROOPS, HAIDER CHARGED, AND HIS SISTER, FARADA BAHANJI, HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN NEW DELHI'S TIHAR JAIL FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER'S ACTIVITIES.  TO CAP OFF THIS LITANY OF ABUSE, HAIDER PRODUCED SEVERAL PHOTOS OF CORPSES, ALL OF WHOM ALLEGEDLY DIED AT THE HANDS OF INDIAN SECURITY FORCES.  ONE PHOTO PURPORTEDLY SHOWED THE REMAINS OF BAIG'S FAMILY HOME WITH A SNAPSHOT OF HIS SISTER SUPERIMPOSED ON IT.  4.  (S)  WHEN PRESSED TO ELABORATE ON THE GROUP'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, HAIDER DEFERRED TO RAZA, A YOUNG, THIN MAN WITH A FULL BEARD AND TURBAN.  RAZA SAID THE JKIF HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO FORMULATE A POLITICAL AGENDA AND THE FOCUS WAS STILL ON ARMED RESISTANCE TO INDIAN OCCUPATION OF KASHMIR.  THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE JKIF IS KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE, HE COMMENTED, BUT AFTER INDIAN TROOPS VACATE KASHMIR, THE GROUP WOULD THEN BE AMENABLE TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS, EVEN IF THAT MEANT A VOTE TO JOIN INDIA.  THE JKIF IS PRIMARILY A NATIONALIST MOVEMENT, RAZA CONTINUED, AND DOES NOT ESPOUSE A PARTICULARLY RADICAL BRAND OF ISLAM, DESPITE ITS NAME.  AT THIS POINT, HAIDER JUMPED IN AND ENDED THIS SEGMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BY EMBARKING ON A LONG, RAMBLING DISCOURSE ABOUT THE COMMON ROOTS OF JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, WHILE TAKING PAINS TO MENTION THAT THE JKIF WAS NOT AGAINST \"ORDINARY HINDUS.\"  5.  (S)  TURNING TO THE GROUP'S MILITARY OPERATIONS, HAIDER SAID THE JKIF'S PRIMARY TARGETS ARE INDIAN REGULAR AND PARAMILITARY FORCES IN KASHMIR, THOUGH HE ADDED THAT \"THOSE WHO COMPROMISE\" WITH THE INDIANS WERE ALSO KILLED.  ASKED WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED \"COMPROMISERS,\" HAIDER LISTED BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS IN THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR GOVERNMENT AS THE MAIN CULPRITS, BUT STATED THAT ANYONE WHO \"BECOMES A HINDRANCE\" WAS ALSO A POTENTIAL TARGET, INCLUDING MUSLIM COLLABORATORS.  HAIDER BECAME QUITE AGITATED WHEN DISCUSSING THOSE WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED ENEMIES, REPEATEDLY BARING HIS CHEST WHILE STATING THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE FOR KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE.  \"I WOULD KILL THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IF I COULD,\" HE ASSERTED.  A FAVORITE METHOD OF ATTACKING INDIAN TROOPS IS SUICIDE BOMBINGS, HAIDER ASSERTED, \"JUST LIKE HAMAS IN ISRAEL.\"  RDX IS THE EXPLOSIVE OF CHOICE, HE EXPLAINED, AND ATTACKS ARE CAREFULLY PLANNED AFTER TARGETS ARE CASED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. HAIDER WAS EVASIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT BOMBINGS OF NON-MILITARY TARGETS, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT THE JKIF WAS A TERRORIST GROUP.  6.  (S)  HAIDER ESTIMATED THE JKIF'S STRENGTH AT BETWEEN 500 AND 1,000 MILITANTS, DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR PEAK IN 1992, WHEN THE GROUP BOASTED 4,000 FIGHTERS.  THE INDIANS HAVE KILLED MORE THAN 2,000 JKIF FIGHTERS SINCE THEN, HAIDER ADMITTED, BUT HE SAID THE GROUP STILL FIELDED THE SECOND-LARGEST MILITANT FORCE IN KASHMIR AFTER THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN (NOTE:  ALMOST EVERY KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUP CLAIMS TO HAVE THE SECOND-LARGEST NUMBER OF FIGHTERS IN INDIAN KASHMIR, BUT ALL AGREE THAT THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN IS NUMBER ONE).  ROUGHLY 200 FIGHTERS ARE IN AZAD KASHMIR AT ANY GIVEN TIME, WHILE THE REST ARE OPERATING INSIDE INDIAN KASHMIR.  TRAINING TAKES PLACE IN CAMPS IN AZAD KASHMIR, HAIDER EXPLAINED, BUT HE DENIED THAT THE GROUP RECEIVED ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE PAKISTANI ARMY.  ALL OF THE JKIF'S FIGHTERS ARE KASHMIRIS, EITHER FROM AZAD OR INDIAN KASHMIR, HAIDER CLAIMED, THOUGH HE CONCEDED THAT \"ONE OR TWO\" AFGHANS COULD BE IN THE GROUP WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.  RECRUITS RANGE IN AGE FROM TEENAGERS TO MEN IN THEIR 40'S AND 50'S, AND ALL RECEIVE ONE TO TWO MONTHS TRAINING BEFORE BEING SENT ACROSS THE LINE-OF-CONTROL (LOC) INTO INDIAN KASHMIR.  CROSSING THE LOC IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, HAIDER SAID, THEREFORE THE SIZE OF INFILTRATING GROUPS IS KEPT SMALL -- NO MORE THAN 20 MEN -- SO THAT CASUALTIES ARE LIMITED IF THE GROUP IS CAUGHT IN AN INDIAN AMBUSH. HAIDER DENIED THAT PAKISTANI TROOPS PROVIDE COVERING FIRE FOR JKIF MILITANTS.  7.  (S)  COMMENT:  HAIDER SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUP AT OUR NEXT MEETING, WHILE BOTH HE AND BAIG, WHO HAD REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE U.S. VIEWED JKIF AS A TERRORIST OUTFIT (SOMETHING WHICH WE DID NOT BRING UP FOR FEAR OF PROVOKING AN ABRUPT END TO OUR VISIT).  USHERING US TO THE DOOR, HAIDER WHISPERED THAT HE WOULD ALSO SHARE WITH US \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" ABOUT THE APHC'S ACTIVITIES THE NEXT TIME WE MET.  OBVIOUSLY MUCH OF WHAT SAID BY THESE MEN WAS TAILORED TO FIT THE AUDIENCE, BUT WE OFFER IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, AND WE WILL ATTEMPT GLEAN MORE ABOUT THE GROUP AND THEIR ACTIVITIES IN FUTURE MEETINGS.

(U)  CLASSIFIED BY CDA ALAN EASTHAM, 1.5D.  2. (C)  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD SUMMONED P-5 CHIEFS OF MISSION ON A HALF-HOUR'S NOTICE APRIL 6 TO INFORM US OF THE \"SUCCESSFUL TEST\" OF THE \"INDIGENOUS\" GHAURI MISSILE, WHICH HE SAID HAD A 1,500 KM RANGE FOR A 700 KG PAYLOAD.  HALF HIS PRESENTATION WAS ON THE MISSILE; THE OTHER HALF WAS AN INDIA-CENTRIC JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE TESTING.  CHARGE' OFFERED AN INFORMAL IMMEDIATE REACTION IN PRIVATE, NOTING THAT THE TEST WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION FOR RESTRAINT MADE IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  END SUMMARY.  3.  (U)  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD CALLED IN THE AMBASSADORS OF RUSSIA, U.K. AND FRANCE AND THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN CHARGES ON APRIL 6.  FOLLOWING IS A DIGEST OF HIS PRESENTATION:  --  I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME TO INFORM YOU THAT AS A PART OF PAKISTAN'S INTEGRATED MISSILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, TODAY WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FLIGHT-TESTED THE SURFACE-TO-SURFACE \"GHAURI\" MISSILE IN THE HATF SERIES.  (COMMENT: AN ACCOMPANYING PRESS RELEASE CALLS THIS MISSILE THE \"HATF-FIVE\" (ROMAN NUMERAL HATF-V).  --  THIS MISSILE HAS A RANGE OF 1,500 KM AND A PAYLOAD OF 700KG.  --  THIS TEST REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD IN OUR INDIGENOUS MISSILE AND SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAMS.  WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS INDIGENOUS CAPABILITY THROUGH THE COMMITMENT OF PAKISTANI SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS.  --  WE DO NOT HAVE TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY REGARDING INDIAN FLIGHT TESTS.  INDIA HAS CONDUCTED 16 TESTS OF THE PAKISTAN-SPECIFIC PRITHVI MISSILE AND HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED IT ALONG OUR BORDERS. INDIA HAS ALSO TESTED THE AGNI MISSILE FOUR TIMES.  --  IN SPITE OF THE INDIAN PROVOCATIVE TESTS IN THEIR NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXERCISED EXTREME RESTRAINT. BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT PAKISTAN'S SECURITY.  --  LET ME REITERATE THAT PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW RESTRAINT. WE DO NOT WANT TO SPARK A NUCLEAR AND MISSILE ARMS RACE IN SOUTH ASIA.  --  WE HAVE ALREADY MADE FORMAL PROPOSALS TO INDIA FOR MUTUAL AND EQUITABLE RESTRAINT IN THE NUCLEAR AND MISSILE AREA WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY RESPONSE.  WE ARE PREPARED TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH INDIA ON NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE ISSUES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE, WHICH AS YOU KNOW REMAINS STALEMATED BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES.  --  ON OUR PART WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO OVERCOME THESE PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES;  WE HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  4.  (C)  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHERE THE TEST HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT; THE FS SAID \"IN PAKISTAN, ON LAND.\"  SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP REVOLVED AROUND THE DIALOGUE WITH INDIA, WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OFFERING NOTHING NEW.  ACCOMPANYING PRESS RELEASE (FAXED TO SA/PAB) ADDS NOTHING TO WHAT IS REPORTED ABOVE.  5.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE GROUP SESSION, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ASKED TO SEE CHARGE' PRIVATELY TO DISCUSS ANOTHER MATTER.  IN HIS OFFICE, CHARGE' SAID THAT NEWS OF THIS TEST MAY BE TAKEN BADLY IN WASHINGTON, SINCE IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE U.S. BELIEVES THE DECISION TO TEST A NEW MISSILE COULD HAVE BEEN POSTPONED IN ORDER TO LET THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISH ITSELF.  HOW THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT IS UNPREDICTABLE.  6. (C) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY RESPONDED BY REITERATING THE POINTS CITED ABOVE ON INDIAN TESTS, ADDING THAT \"NO ONE EVER SAID ANYTHING\" ABOUT INDIAN MISSILE TESTING. CHARGE' SAID THAT OF COURSE IT WAS UP TO PAKISTAN HOW PAKISTAN TOOK CARE OF ITS OWN SECURITY, BUT FROM HIS RECOLLECTION IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE INDIANS HAD COMPLETED THE \"TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION\" PHASE OF AGNI TESTING.  THE DIFFICULTY OF MISSILE SYSTEMS WAS THEIR DESTABILIZING EFFECT IN TIMES OF TENSION.  ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TARIQ ALTAF QUICKLY ADDED THAT THE BJP PLATFORM CALLED FOR \"INDUCTING\" NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO INDIA'S FORCES, A POINT WHICH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY QUICKLY ENDORSED.  CHARGE' CLOSED THE SESSION BY SAYING THAT AS THE SECRETARY HAD SUGGESTED IN HER LETTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD ACCEPTED IN HIS REPLY, THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION DURING THE VISIT OF AMBASSADORS RICHARDSON AND INDERFURTH AND MR. RIEDEL.  7. (C) COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD USE AMBASSADOR KHOKHAR'S CALL ON ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH TODAY TO CONVEY MORE FORMAL REGRETS ABOUT PAKISTAN'S DECISION TO TEST THIS MISSILE, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY'S LETTER SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING RESTRAINT IN MISSILE TESTING.  (FYI, WE HAD A SUGGESTION FROM ANOTHER SENIOR PAKISTANI OVER THE WEEKEND THAT SOME AT LEAST THINK PAKISTAN DID EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN NOT TESTING BEFORE MARCH 23 AND IN NOT DISPLAYING THE MISSILE THAT DAY DURING THE PAKISTAN DAY PARADE.)  8. (C) NOTE ALSO THAT THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A \"FLIGHT TEST,\" AND NOT/NOT AS INDUCTION OF THE MISSILE INTO PAKISTAN'S ARMED FORCES. THE PAKISTANIS VIEW THIS AS CATCHING UP TO THE INDIANS, SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO AGNI, AND NOT AS LEAPFROGGING THEIR MISSILE CAPABILITIES.   THE TIMING IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE BJP GOVERNMENT IN INDIA AND EXTREME PAKISTANI NERVOUSNESS ABOUT BJP PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE NUCLEAR AREA, SPECIFICALLY THE DECLARATIONS OF THE INTENTION TO \"INDUCT\" NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  THE PAKISTANIS DECIDED TO LAY DOWN A FIRM MARKER BOTH TO THE INDIANS AND THE PAKISTANI PUBLIC THAT PAKISTANI CAPABILITIES IN THIS FIELD ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  THIS TEST WILL PRESENT THE BJP- LED GOVERNMENT IN INDIA WITH A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE SECURITY FIELD AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF IN DELHI.   EASTHAM " }

ISLAMABAD 3446; B. ISLAMABAD 3358  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ALAN EASTHAM.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED COMPLAINED TO THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 8 ABOUT THE \"ONE-SIDED VIEW\" OF THE JUST-RELEASED USG REPORT ON TERRORISM, LAMENTING THAT INDIA WAS PORTRAYED MORE POSITIVELY THAN PAKISTAN.  ACKNOWLEDGING A RECENT RESPITE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 KILLINGS OF 22 PEOPLE IN AZAD KASHMIR -- REF B), SHAMSHAD URGED THE U.S. TO USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO STOP INDIAN SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.  CONCERNING THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP HAD CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED NOT TO RETALIATE, BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUCH RESTRAINT IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH INCIDENTS.  HE NOTED THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE, DIALOGUE WITH INDIA WOULD BE DIFFICULT, BUT HE SAID THE GOP NEVERTHELESS LOOKS FORWARD TO A SUMMIT MEETING WITH THE INDIANS IN COLOMBO IN JULY TO EXPLORE HOW TO PROCEED WITH THE DIALOGUE.  THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE GOP RESTRAINT IN THE WAKE OF THE \"SHOCKING\" EVENT OF APRIL 26/27 AND NOTED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD SHAMSHAD'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE LIMITLESS IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH TRAGIC INCIDENTS. SHIFTING TO AFGHANISTAN, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS ENHEARTENED BY THE TALIBAN AGREEMENT TO RELEASE 1000 TONS OF FOOD FOR BAMIYAN AND SAID ISLAMABAD IS PUSHING FOR A COORDINATORS' MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.  (SEE REF A FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENT POWER PROJECTS.) END SUMMARY  2. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR MAY 8 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RECENTLY-RELEASED USG REPORT, \"PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM.\"  ACCORDING TO SHAMSHAD, THE REPORT GAVE A \"ONE-SIDED VIEW\" OF THE SITUATIONS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE PAKISTAN SECTION OF THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND THE HARAKAT-UL-ANSAR, WHILE THE INDIA SECTION EMPHASIZED THE MILITANCY IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, WHICH -- SHAMSHAD STRESSED -- IS ACTUALLY \"AN INDIGENOUS FREEDOM STRUGGLE.\" HE DECRIED THAT THE REPORT REFERRED TO NUMEROUS BOMBINGS IN INDIA (ASCRIBED TO CROSS-BORDER SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM), WHILE THE REPORT MAKES NO MENTION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN, IN WHICH THE INDIANS HAVE HAD A ROLE, HE ADDED.  \"WE EXPECTED THE USG TO UNDERTAKE AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE SITUATIONS IN BOTH COUNTRIES,\" HE LAMENTED.  \"WASHINGTON,\" HE CONTINUED, \"MUST USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO STOP GOI SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.\" FINISHING HIS THOUGHT, SHAMSHAD NOTED THAT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN A \"RESPITE\" IN INDIAN-SUPPORTED TERRORISM IN PAKISTAN, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 SLAYINGS OF 22 KASHMIRIS IN AZAD KASHMIR (REF B).  3. (C) SHUFFLING NOTES, SHAMSHAD GAVE A VIRTUALLY VERBATIM REPEAT OF A MAY 4 BRIEFING GIVEN BY MFA ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (SOUTH ASIA) TARIQ ALTAF (AND ATTENDED BY POLOFF) ON THE KILLINGS IN AZAD KASHMIR.  DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT AS \"VERY SERIOUS,\" SHAMSHAD SAID THE INCIDENT WAS THE FIRST \"TRANS-LINE OF CONTROL\" INCIDENT OF THAT NATURE -- \"THE ATTACK ACROSS THE LOC VIOLATED THE SANCTITY OF THE LINE OF CONTROL, SOMETHING WHICH MUST BE RESPECTED.\"  PAKISTAN, HE SAID, HAS MADE A DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO RETALIATE TO REDUCE RISKS OF THE SITUATION \"GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.\"  HE ADDED THAT THE INCIDENT HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC OPINION, AND THERE MUST BE AN IMMEDIATE END TO SUCH EVENTS, WARNING THAT IF THERE ARE MORE SUCH INCIDENTS, \"PAKISTAN WOULD FIND IT HARD NOT TO RETALIATE.\"  OBSERVING THAT PAKISTAN CONDEMNS TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, SHAMSHAD DECLARED THAT THERE IS A \"QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE\" BETWEEN VIOLENT ACTS ON THE INDIAN SIDE -- \"THERE'S A FREEDOM STRUGGLE UNDERWAY THERE\" -- AND THE PAK SIDE, \"WHERE THERE IS NO SUCH STRUGGLE.\"  4. (C) SHIFTING FOCUS, SHAMSHAD ASSERTED THAT \"PAKISTAN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNE TIME TO PICK UP THE THREAD OF INDO-PAK DIALOGUE.\"  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT DELHI WOULD \"ADOPT A SERIOUS ATTITUDE\" TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESUMING THE DIALOGUE. DECLARING THAT THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED TO BE CONVINCED ON THE DIALOGUE, SHAMSHAD SAID THAT IN THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE \"NO GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO CARRY ON THE TALKS.\"  SHAMSHAD OBSERVED THAT ISLAMABAD NEVERTHELESS IS \"EARNESTLY LOOKING FORWARD\" TO THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS' MEETING IN COLOMBO \"TO EXPLORE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE.\"  HE SAID ISLAMABAD WOULD SEND INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS HIGH COMMISSION IN DELHI TO THIS EFFECT, BUT \"ONLY AFTER THE CURRENT PUBLIC ATTITUDE SUBSIDES.\"  WASHINGTON, HE ADDED, CAN PLAY A ROLE IN KEEPING TEMPERS LOW.  RETURNING TO HIS THEME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, SHAMSHAD SAID WASHINGTON SHOULD AVOID TAKING PRO-INDIAN STANCES WHICH PROVOKE A PAKISTANI REACTION, ADDING THAT THE GOP \"IS DOING ITS BEST\" TO CONTROL THE PUBLIC REACTION TO THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED MTCR-RELATED SANCTIONS ON KHAN RESEARCH LABORATORIES.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE GOP SEEMED TO BE SUCCEEDING IN THAT REGARD AS THE REACTION HAS BEEN \"MODEST.\"  5. (C) RESPONDING TO SHAMSHAD'S LENGTHY MONOLOGUE, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD CONVEY TO WASHINGTON THE GOP'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE TERRORISM REPORT.  DODGING THE AMBASSADOR'S SEVERAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHY THE ATTACKERS IN THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT FOCUSSED ON ONLY TWO FAMILIES, SHAMSHAD SAID THE KILLERS WANTED TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS \"AN INSIDE JOB.\"  RESPONDING TO ANOTHER QUERY, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP WAS SURE THE ATTACKERS HAD COME FROM ACROSS THE LOC -- \"WE HAVE INTERCEPTS THAT MAKE THAT CLEAR,\" HE NOTED.  TERMING THE INCIDENT \"SHOCKING AND UNFORGIVABLE,\" THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE RESTRAINT THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXERCISED IN THE WAKE OF THE INCIDENT, ADDING THAT HE UNDERSTANDS SHAMSHAD'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE LIMITLESS IF SUCH INCIDENTS WERE REPEATED.  THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THAT THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION FOR THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE.  RETURNING YET AGAIN TO HIS THEME OF USG ONE-SIDEDNESS, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE KILLINGS, REITERATING THAT WASHINGTON DOES NOT MENTION THE INDIAN ROLE IN FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN PAKISTAN -- \"FOR US THIS IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE,\" HE ADDED. WARMING TO THIS THEME, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THE REPORTED WASHINGTON DENIAL THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING SANCTIONING INDIA ON THE SAGARIKA MISSILE.  \"BREAKTHROUGH ON AFGHANISTAN\" -----------------------------  6. (C) TURNING TO THE RECENT AFGHANISTAN STEERING COMMITTEE TALKS IN ISLAMABAD BETWEEN THE TALIBAN AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, SHAMSHAD SAID THE TALKS HAD BEEN \"A GOOD SUCCESS, A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH, THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS THAT THE SIDES SAT TOGETHER FACE-TO-FACE.\"  HE GAVE THE U.S. AND HIS OWN GOVERNMENT CREDIT FOR THE MEETINGS.  PAKISTAN'S DESIRE, HE ADDED, IS TO FACILITATE THE AFGHANISTAN DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND HE RECOUNTED PAK EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT THE TALKS.  HE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIVE DAYS OF TALKS HAD BEEN \"INCONCLUSIVE,\" ONE SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED -- \"PAKISTAN IS KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH ALL PARTIES.\" TAKING CREDIT FOR THE RECENT TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN PROVINCE, SHAMSHAD SAID THIS \"MAKES QUITE CLEAR THAT IF YOU DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN, THEN YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING.\"  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT \"MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING.\"  WHAT IS IMPORTANT, SHAMSHAD UNDERSCORED, IS HOW ONE DEALS WITH THE TALIBAN.  SCORING THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS NOW PUSHING FOR A \"COORDINATORS' MEETING\" BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES -- \"PAKISTAN IS INTENSIFYING ITS EFFORTS TO GET THE TWO SIDES BACK TOGETHER SOON; WE MUST NOT LOSE THE MOMENTUM.\"  HE PROMISED TO KEEP THE AMBASSADOR FULLY INFORMED OF THE GOP'S PROGRESS ON THE AFGHANISTAN FRONT.  7. (C) NOTING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOP ON AFGHANISTAN, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING AS \"A STEP FORWARD\" RATHER THAN A BREAKTHROUGH.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE GOP'S CONTRIBUTION IN HELPING MAKE THE MEETING HAPPEN.  SHAMSHAD SAID NORTHERN LEADER PROFESSOR RABBANI HAD RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT ON ALLOWING 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN AND WAS NOW CONSULTING HIS ALLIANCE COLLEAGUES.  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE WAS \"THE BIGGEST PROBLEM,\" TO WHICH THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE TALIBAN, TOO, HAD TROUBLES WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS.  SUPPORTING THE NOTION OF A COORDINATORS' MEETING, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. AND PAKISTAN ARE \"ON THE SAME WAVE-LENGTH.\"  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED, IS THAT THE SIDES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AGREEMENT ON \"NO MILITARY OFFENSIVES.\"  ALL SIDES, HE UNDERSCORED, MUST STAY FOCUSSED ON THIS ESSENTIAL POINT.  8. (C) DREDGING UP AN OLD THEME, SHAMSHAD CALLED FOR AN ARMS EMBARGO ON AFGHANISTAN AND ASSERTED THAT PAKISTAN IS READY TO COOPERATE ON THIS.  HE SAID ISLAMABAD IS \"SURPRISED\" THAT THE SIX PLUS TWO PROCESS IS \"SO CASUAL\" ON THE NEED FOR AN EMBARGO. RESPONDING, THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE LAKHDAR BRAHIMI AS SAYING THAT IF PAKISTAN AND IRAN AGREE TO CUT OFF ARMS, THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AN EMBARGO, AND, WITHOUT PAK- IRANIAN AGREEMENT, AN EMBARGO WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.  9. (C) COMMENT:  THIS MEETING WAS VINTAGE SHAMSHAD, WHO DUTIFULLY-- AND WITH SOME PLEASURE -- LAMBASTED AMERICA ON THE LATEST PERCEIVED SLIGHT, BUT WAS BEREFT OF ANY FRESH THINKING ON HOW BEST TO PROCEED IN STRENGTHENING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP OR ON HOW TO WORK TOGETHER MOST CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ADVANCING PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  BUT, WE HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH.   EASTHAM " }

PYATT, REASON 1.5 (D)  THIS IS LAHORE 315  1. (C) SUMMARY: MEETING MAY 25 WITH PRINCIPAL OFFICER, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO SAID SHE WOULD NO LONGER PRESS THE GOVERNMENT TO TEST ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME FOR A DETONATION, BENAZIR ARGUED, BUT AT THIS STAGE A TEST WOULD BE COUNTER TO PAKISTAN'S INTERESTS.  INSTEAD, SHE SAID, THE PPP WILL REDIRECT ITS CRITICISM OF NAWAZ SHARIF TO FOCUS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S \"INDECISION\" AND \"MISMANAGEMENT.\"  BENAZIR ARGUED THAT MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN'S HISTORY WHICH REQUIRES A FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY STRATEGY.  SHE PREDICTED THAT NAWAZ MAY HAVE TO BE \"SACRIFICED\" IN ORDER TO HEAL THE WOUNDED PRIDE OF PAKISTAN'S MILITARY.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER CAUTIONED THAT BENAZIR'S BELLICOSE REACTION TO INDIA'S TESTS HAD DRAWN HARSH CRITICISM IN THE WEST AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PPP STATE PUBLICLY THAT TESTING IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE USED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED HER WIDELY-REPRINTED OP-ED CALLING FOR A PREEMPTIVE MILITARY STRIKE ON INDIA, CLAIMING THAT SHE INVOKED THIS POSSIBILITY ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE -- NOT AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION.  ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, SHE RECOMMENDED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD FOLLOWED BY NEGOTIATIONS TO RATIFY THE CURRENT DIVISION OF KASHMIR. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER MET MAY 25 AT HER REQUEST WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO, WHO WAS IN LAHORE FOR AN APPEARANCE BEFORE THE HIGH COURT'S ACCOUNTABILITY BENCH.  SHE WAS JOINED BY PPP PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT RAO SIKANDER IQBAL AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR QASIM ZIA.  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS IN WHICH PPP LEADERS HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED OUR ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF RESTRAINT (REFTEL) AND TO HAVE CONVINCED BENAZIR TO SOFTEN HER RHETORIC.  SENATE OPPOSITION LEADER AITZAZ AHSAN WENT SO FAR AS TO CLAIM ON MAY 24 THAT BENAZIR HAD \"TAKEN A U-TURN\" AND OPENLY OPPOSED NUCLEAR TESTING IN RECENT PPP LEADERSHIP MEETINGS.  BACK FROM THE BRINK -------------------  3. (C) ASKED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT SHE HAD URGED NATION-WIDE DEMONSTRATIONS IN FAVOR OF TESTING, BENAZIR CLAIMED THAT NO ONE IN THE PPP WOULD CALL FOR TESTING FROM NOW ON.  THE MOMENT HAS PASSED. WE UNDERSTAND THAT A TEST NOW WOULD HAVE A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON PAKISTAN'S ECONOMY AND INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.  I CANNOT SAY THESE THINGS PUBLICLY, BENAZIR SAID, BUT NEITHER WILL I CALL FOR A DETONATION.  AT THE OPPOSITION'S MAY 21 HYDERABAD RALLY, SHE NOTED, THE LINES THAT GOT THE MOST APPLAUSE WERE NOT TAHIR-UL-QADRI'S CALL FOR NUCLEAR TESTING, BUT HER OWN ATTACKS ON NAWAZ SHARIF'S ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP AND MANHOOD.  WHEN PRESSED ON THE PPP'S POSTURE, BENAZIR CONCEDED THAT EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AGAINST TESTING SHE COULD NOT, SINCE THIS WOULD BE ATTACKED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WE WERE DRIVEN INTO THIS ALLIANCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO DEAL WITH US A LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT -- SO NOW WE MUST LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.  4. (C) MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN'S HISTORY, BENAZIR SAID.  WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE OUR SECURITY AND HOW WE LOOK AT INDIA.  ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES, BENAZIR CONTINUED, THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS IN NO HURRY TO TEST A NUCLEAR DEVICE.  HOWEVER, AT LOWER LEVELS OF THE MILITARY THERE IS A FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE SIMILAR TO SENTIMENTS AFTER THE 1971 LOSS OF BANGLADESH.  \"I'M AFRAID NAWAZ MAY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED TO HEAL THAT SENSE OF SHAME,\" BENAZIR ADDED, \"BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHO MIGHT TAKE HIS PLACE.\"  5. (C) EVEN IF I AM NOT CALLING FOR A NUCLEAR TEST, BENAZIR SUGGESTED, NAWAZ SHARIF WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE TO CRITICISMS OF HIS INDECISION IN THE FACE OF INDIA'S AGGRESSION.  \"NAWAZ IS TRYING TO PUT HANDCUFFS ON ME,\" BENAZIR QUIPPED, \"BUT I'M GOING TO PUT BANGLES ON HIM.\" (NOTE: BY SUGGESTING THAT NAWAZ WEARS BANGLES, AS SHE DID IN HYDERABAD, BENAZIR IS QUESTIONING HIS MASCULINITY -- A DEEP INSULT IN THIS SOCIETY.)  SHIFTING THE DEBATE -------------------  6. (C) IF THE PPP HAS DECIDED NUCLEAR TESTING WOULD BE AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS, PRINCIPAL OFFICER SUGGESTED, THEN IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAKE THIS POINT PUBLICLY.  SO FAR IN THIS DEBATE, THE OPPOSITION HAS APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED MORE BY POLITICS THAN BY NATIONAL INTERESTS.  AT THE VERY LEAST, THE PPP SHOULD SIGNAL TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE PARTY HAS DECIDED THIS ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE TREATED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. BENAZIR WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND INSTRUCTED HER COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW-UP.  7. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER ALSO QUESTIONED BENAZIR ON HER MAY 17 LOS ANGELES TIMES OP-ED, WHICH CONCLUDED BY DANGLING THE POSSIBILITY OF A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON INDIA IN RESPONSE TO THE TESTS.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED THIS INTERPRETATION, CLAIMING THE PIECE WAS DRAFTED TO ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE RESPONSES, NOT AS A PRESCRIPTION FOR ACTION. ACTUALLY, BENAZIR SAID, THE IDEA CAME FROM ROBERT MCNAMARA, WHO SUGGESTED WHEN I WAS IN LONDON THAT A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE WOULD BE ONE OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THE UNITED STATES WAS FACED WITH A SIMILAR THREAT.  8. (C) ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, BENAZIR SUGGESTED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS, AFTER WHICH NEGOTIATIONS COULD BEGIN TO MAKE THE LINE OF CONTROL A PERMANENT BORDER.  GIVEN THE NEW STRATEGIC REALITIES, DIVIDING KASHMIR WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY OPTION.  SHE ASSUMED THAT WESTERN SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR RESTRAINT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE FOLLOWED BY PRESSURE TO COME CLEAN AND ADHERE TO THE CTBT AND NPT.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER REPLIED THAT DECISIONS ON NATIONAL SECURITY WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PAKISTANIS, NOT BY OUTSIDE POWERS.  WE HOPE THE DEBATE OVER PAKISTAN'S SECURITY WILL INCLUDE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE SWATH OF POLITICAL OPINION, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON A MORE CIVILIZED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PML AND PPP.  9 COMMENT: BENAZIR REMAINS FIRMLY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF DRIVING NAWAZ SHARIF FROM OFFICE, AND IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HER TO PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT AWAY AT HIS PUBLIC BASE.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE MOST IN THE OPPOSITION, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LASTING DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE DONE BY A NUCLEAR TEST, AND APPEARS GENUINE IN HER VIEW THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT NOW TEST.  CRITICISM FROM HER MORE COURAGEOUS PARTY COLLEAGUES AND ADVISERS IN THE U.S. MAY ALSO HAVE HELPED TO MODERATE HER OPINION.  THIS SHIFT MAY BUY THE GOVERNMENT A LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM, BUT NOT MUCH.  INDEED, BENAZIR'S NEW TACTIC OF QUESTIONING NAWAZ' MANHOOD MAY PROVE A POWERFUL CATALYST TOWARDS THE NUCLEAR TEST THAT SHE NOW CLAIMS TO OPPOSE.   SIMONS " }

REASON:  1.5(D).  1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER'S OPPONENTS SEE NAWAZ SHARIF'S HESITATION IN RESPONDING TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR CHALLENGE AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDAS. PAKISTAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP) LEADER BENAZIR BHUTTO HAS CALLED FOR NAWAZ'S RESIGNATION AND THE FORMATION OF A \"NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.\" THE OPPOSITION COALITION PAKISTANI AWAMI ITTEHAD (PAI) -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST ELEMENT -- HAS DEMANDED THAT PAKISTAN CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES (NOT PART OF THE PAI) ARE THREATENING TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO CARRY OUT A NUCLEAR TEST BY MAY 30.  IN PRIVATE, HOWEVER, BENAZIR HERSELF (REF C) AS WELL AS THE PPP'S SPOKESMAN AND ONE OF THE PARTY'S SENATORS SEPARATELY TOLD US THEY FEEL THE TIME IS PAST FOR A NUCLEAR TEST IN RESPONSE TO INDIA'S MAY 11 AND 13 BLASTS. DESPITE OPPOSITION ATTEMPTS TO DEPICT HIM AS WEAK AND INDECISIVE, A RECENT GALLUP POLL GIVES NAWAZ A 77 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING ON HIS HANDLING OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS.  END SUMMARY.  PPP SPOKESMAN SEES INDIAN TEST AS \"GODSEND\" -------------------------------------------  2.  (C)  PAKISTAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP) SPOKESMAN FARHATULLAH BABAR TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS ON MAY 11 AND MAY 13 WERE A \"GODSEND\" FOR HIS PARTY'S EFFORTS TO SHAKE NAWAZ SHARIF'S HOLD ON POWER.  BABAR SAID THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS IN KIND HAS NOW BEEN LOST AND IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT PAKISTAN REASSERT ITS DETERMINATION TO RETAIN ITS NUCLEAR OPTION (WITHOUT CONDUCTING A TEST) AND THAT THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT STEP DOWN AND MAKE WAY FOR A \"NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\" THAT COULD EFFECTIVELY CONFRONT THE INDIAN MENACE.  FOLLOWING A SIMILAR LINE, PPP SENATOR RAZA RABBANI TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT THE TIME FOR PAKISTAN TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S TEST WITH A TEST OF ITS OWN WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN 48 TO 72 HOURS AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS.  NOW, HE SAID, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS WEAKNESS AND INDECISION AND SHOULD STEP ASIDE IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  3.  (U)  THE PPP, THE PAI, AND BHUTTO HERSELF HAVE BEEN SENDING MIXED SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR TEST.  ON MAY 25 BHUTTO TOLD LAHORE PO THAT SHE HAS DROPPED HER CALL FOR PAKISTAN TO CONDUCT ITS OWN NUCLEAR TEST (REF C).  BUT ON MAY 27, THE PRESS QUOTES HER AS SAYING THAT \"A NUCLEAR TEST BY PAKISTAN IS NECESSARY TO KEEP INDIA AT BAY AND TO REVITALIZE THE STRUGGLE IN KASHMIR.\" FOLLOWING HER MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER GOHAR AYUB ON MAY 22, BENAZIR SAID SHE WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH INDIA, BUT THEN REPEATED HER CALL FOR THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  IN LAHORE ON MAY 24, THE PAKISTAN AWAMI ITTEHAD -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT -- CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S NUCLEAR CHALLENGE BY TESTING A PAKISTANI BOMB, OR TO RESIGN.  THE PAI MEETING IN LAHORE WAS ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM 41 POLITICAL PARTIES IN PAKISTAN (MOST OF WHICH HAVE NO ELECTORAL WEIGHT); MINISTER FOR TOURISM SHEIKH RASHID AHMAD ATTENDED TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE.  AFTER DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS WEAK RESPONSE TO THE INDIAN CHALLENGE, BENAZIR BHUTTO ACCUSED NAWAZ ET AL OF SPENDING THEIR TIME LOOKING FOR WAYS TO VICTIMIZE HER AND HER FAMILY RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE COUNTRY'S GRAVE SECURITY SITUATION.  MAY 28 PRESS ACCOUNTS REPORT THAT PAI PRESIDENT PROFESSOR TAHIRUL QADRI HAS SUPPORTED THE MAY 30 DEADLINE FOR A NUCLEAR TEST SET BY THE ISLAMIST PARTIES (SEE BELOW).  ISLAMIC PARTIES DEMAND NUCLEAR TEST -----------------------------------  4.  (U)  ALL OF THE MAJOR ISLAMIC PARTIES, INCLUDING THE JAMAAT-I- ISLAMI (JI) LED BY QAZI HUSSAIN AHMAD, THE JAMIAT-UL-ULEMAI ISLAM (F)(JUI-F), LED BY MAULANA FAZAL-UR-REHMAN, AND THE FACTION OF THE JAMIAT ULEMA E-PAKISTAN (JUP-N) LED BY MAULANA SHAH AHMED NOORANI HAVE PUBLICLY CALLED FOR A PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST.  REFLECTING PERHAPS THE LACK OF PUBLIC DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, THE JI'S CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE ON MAY 22 TO PROTEST THE FAILURE TO CONDUCT A TEST WAS LARGELY IGNORED BY SHOPKEEPERS. VARIOUS OTHER PARTIES HAVE CALLED FOR A NATIONWIDE PROTEST CAMPAIGN IF A TEST DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MAY 30.  IRONICALLY, IN AFGHANISTAN THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM THE JI AND THE JUI-F, HAS ENDORSED PAKISTAN'S RIGHT TO CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST, WHILE CALLING UPON IT TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. MEANWHILE, THE LEADER OF THE PML/N'S COALITION PARTNER, THE SHIIA TEHRIK-E-JAFRIA PAKISTAN (TJP), ALLAMA SAJJID ALI NAQVI, HAS URGED NAWAZ TO REJECT AMERICAN HELP AND TO GO AHEAD WITH A NUCLEAR TEST. IN A REPORT APPEARING IN THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF \"THE MUSLIM,\" NAQVI IS SAID TO BELIEVE THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT MOVE TOWARD THE U.S. AS THIS COULD ENDANGER ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS \"TRADITIONAL ALLIES IRAN AND CHINA.\"  DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS, NOT POLICY ------------------------------------  5.  (C)  BHUTTO'S CRITICISMS OF THE SHARIF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MORE AT ITS TACTICS IN DEALING WITH THE INDIAN THREAT THAN AT ITS POLICY.  HER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE ECHOED BY BABAR IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF MAY 26.  THE PPP'S LINE APPEARS TO BE THAT IF BENAZIR HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER, THE INDIANS WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKELY TO TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  (BABAR, FOR INSTANCE, CREDITED BENAZIR'S PREEMPTIVE DIPLOMACY IN 1995 WITH HEADING OFF AN INDIAN TEST AT THAT TIME.)  SPEAKING AT THE MAY 24 PAI MEETING IN LAHORE, BENAZIR SAID NAWAZ SHARIF'S \"GOOD MAN GUJRAL\" LINE LAST YEAR HAD BROUGHT PAKISTAN TO \"THE BRINK OF DISASTER.\"  ONCE INDIA DETONATED ITS BOMBS, BENAZIR (AND BABAR) SAID SHARIF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN VIGOROUS ACTION TO LINE-UP INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AND CONDEMNATION OF INDIA. BABAR TOLD POLOFF THAT SHARIF HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS TO SEEK SUPPORT RATHER THAN SENDING A \"LOW-LEVEL\" CAREER DIPLOMAT LIKE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED.  SHARIF HAD ALSO FAILED TO RALLY THE MUSLIM WORLD TO PAKISTAN'S SIDE, BABAR SAID, AND HE CLAIMED THAT BENAZIR WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN NAWAZ IN WINNING WESTERN SUPPORT.  MEANWHILE, BENAZIR IS CLAIMING CREDIT FOR PAKISTAN'S CAPABILITY OF READYING FOR A TEST IN TWO WEEKS; SHE SAID EARLIER PAKISTAN HAD REQUIRED 30 DAYS TO READY FOR A TEST, BUT SHE HAD CUT THAT BACK.  6.  (C)  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER BABAR NOR BENAZIR HERSELF HAS WARNED NAWAZ AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE RESTRAINT ON NUCLEAR TESTING BY PROMISES OF AID.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES AND MOST OF THE MAJOR URDU AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS HAVE CAUTIONED NAWAZ TO BEWARE OF AMERICAN BLANDISHMENTS.  BENAZIR AND THE PPP, HOWEVER, SEEM WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE U.S. WILL DO IN RETURN FOR PAKISTANI RESTRAINT.  7.  (C)  COMMENT:  POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM -- NOT CONCERNS FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR PAKISTAN -- SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE OPPOSITION'S UNRELENTING ATTACKS ON THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN IN OVERDRIVE DEPICTING NAWAZ AS INDECISIVE AND WEAK, GIVING HIM NO CREDIT FOR TAKING TIME TO WEIGH CAREFULLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF PAKISTAN'S CONDUCTING (OR NOT CONDUCTING) A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE OPPOSITION'S SUCCESS IN TURNING THE PUBLIC AGAINST CONTINUED RESTRAINT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION.  A JUST-RELEASED GALLUP POLL, FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTS THAT OVER TWO-THIRDS OF RESPONDENTS FAVORED A PAK NUCLEAR TEST, BUT \"IN RESPONSE TO FRIENDLY ADVICE\" TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT, NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD THEN FAVOR CONTINUED RESTRAINT.  77 PERCENT WERE \"SATISFIED\" WITH HOW NAWAZ SHARIF HAS HANDLED THE SITUATION.  (SEPTEL PROVIDES MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE POLL.)   SIMONS " }

(U) SOMBER AND TIRED LOOKING, PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF TOLD HIS NATION MAY 28 EVENING THAT PAKISTAN HAD SUCCESSFULLY EXPLODED FIVE NUCLEAR DEVICES SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER IN THE DAY.  A RECURRING THEME THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH WAS THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR THREAT BEGINNING AS FAR BACK AS THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST IN 1974 AND AS RECENTLY AS THE TESTS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS MONTH.  NAWAZ SAID IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TAKEN THE INDIAN THREAT SERIOUSLY, THEN PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT HAVE NEEDED TO TEST.  2. (U) NAWAZ TRIED TO STEEL HIS NATION FOR TOUGH TIMES AHEAD AND DECLARED THAT HE AND ALL GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE READY FOR AN ERA OF AUSTERITY AND SIMPLICITY, STARTING WITH NAWAZ'S GIVING UP THE NEWLY-OPENED AND PALATIAL PRIME MINISTER'S SECRETARIAT BUILDING, WHICH HE PROPOSED COULD BE CONVERTED INTO A HOSPITAL, WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY, OR SOME OTHER CHARITY USE.  HE URGED PAKISTANIS TO BRACE THEMSELVES FOR DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD AND TO FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES COURAGEOUSLY AND BOLDLY.  HE DECLARED PAKISTAN'S OPTIONS OF BECOMING SLAVES OR LEADING HONORABLE AND INDEPENDENT LIVES LEFT PAKISTAN NO CHOICE.  3. (U) REFLECTING INDO-PAK TIT-FOR-TAT MENTALITY, NAWAZ SAID PAKISTAN HAD RESPONDED TO INDIA'S MISSILE TESTS WITH ITS OWN TEST OF THE GHAURI MISSILE LAST MONTH, AND PAKISTAN HAS NOW RESPONDED TO INDIA'S FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS WITH FIVE OF ITS OWN.  HE DECLARED THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PAST DAYS IS NOW GONE, AND IF INDIA IS AGGRESSIVE, PAKISTAN WILL FIGHT BACK -- THE ARMED FORCES ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT AND THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS ARE PREPARED TO MEET ANY CHALLENGE.  NAWAZ SAID THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS HE WILL AGAIN SPEAK TO THE NATION TO ANNOUNCE A \"NATIONAL AGENDA.\"  4. (U) IN A DIPLOMATIC SOP, NAWAZ PRAISED THE CHINESE, WHOM HE CALLED GREAT AND RELIABLE FRIENDS AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE JAPANESE, WHOM HE SAID WOULD HAVE AVOIDED HAVING HAD THEIR CITIES SUBJECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACK HAD JAPAN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE SAID HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FIVE CALLS AND SAID THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD PAKISTAN'S DIFFICULTIES.  5. (C) COMMENT:  AT THE END OF THE DAY, NAWAZ FELL VICTIM TO THE HARDLINERS BOTH IN THE OPPOSITION AND WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT WHO WERE RELENTLESS IN WHIPPING UP A MEDIA FRENZY DEMANDING A PAKISTANI RESPONSE IN KIND.  THERE WERE FEW EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC COUNTERVAILING FORCES BUILDING MEDIA AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR RESTRAINT.  NAWAZ'S DECISION TO TEST WAS FUELED BY CONCERNS THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO GIVE HIS FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION THE \"NAWAZ-IS-WEAK-ON-INDIA\" ISSUE TO COALESCE AROUND IN THEIR BID TO FORCE HIM FROM POWER.  IN HIS SPEECH, NAWAZ PLAYED TO PAKISTANI FEARS OF INDIAN EXPANSIONISM AND DISTRUST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW LONG PAKISTANIS WILL RALLY AROUND THE FLAG ONCE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS KICK IN, FURTHER CHALLENGING THIS ALREADY VULNERABLE ECONOMY.  NAWAZ'S NOTION THAT PAKISTANIS WILL \"SACRIFICE\" BY GIVING UP LONG CHERISHED \"RIGHTS\" SUCH AS STEALING NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY AND AVOIDING TAXES STRIKE US AS MORE WISHFUL THAN REALISTIC.  PAKISTANIS HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED TALKING ABOUT EATING GRASS (IN PURSUIT OF NATIONAL SECURITY) RATHER THAN ACTUALLY HAVING TO EAT IT.   SIMONS " }

HE BELIEVES THE PROGRAM IS PROCEEDING QUICKLY, THANKS TO FORMER SOVIET SCIENTISTS \"PURCHASED\" FROM RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AZERBAIJAN AND UZBEKISTAN.

THE LETTER HAD EARLIER BEEN FAXED TO SA/PAB; THE ORIGINAL IS BEING SENT BY POUCH.  2. (C) BEGIN TEXT:  28TH MAY 1998 HIS EXCELLENCY MR. WILLIAM J. CLINTON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WASHINGTON, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,  I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERILOUS SITUATION RESULTING FROM INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS.  OUR TELEPHONIC CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST FORTNIGHT CONVINCED ME OF YOUR SINCERITY AND YOUR GENUINE CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN'S SECURITY AND THE STABILITY OF THE REGION.  THE OVERT NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION OF INDIA HAS CREATED A STRATEGIC IMBALANCE, EMBOLDENING INDIAN LEADERSHIP TO HOLD OUT THREATS OF NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL AGAINST PAKISTAN AND AGGRESSION ACROSS THE LINE OF CONTROL IN KASHMIR.  AS ADVISED BY YOU AND OUR OTHER FRIENDS, WE PONDERED HARD AND DELIBERATED CAREFULLY ON OUR DIRE SECURITY PREDICAMENT.  DETERMINED TO ACT WITH UTMOST RESPONSIBILITY, DESPITE GRAVE PROVOCATIONS, WE ALSO CLOSELY EVALUATED THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION, WHICH REGRETTABLY DID NOT FACTOR THE THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND TO REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY.  WHILE I WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SECURITY CONCERNS, THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO INDIA'S CROSSING OF THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD WAS REGRETTABLY DEFERENTIAL, BORDERING ON ACQUIESCENCE.  WE SAW A FAMILIAR PATTERN, WHEREBY INDIA'S INCREMENTAL STEPS ON THE NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC LADDER HAD ONLY GENERATED PRESSURES AND EVEN PUNITIVE ACTIONS AGAINST PAKISTAN.  FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, PAKISTAN ADVOCATED, IN ALL EARNEST, THE GOAL OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION.  OUR IMPECCABLE RECORD OF RESTRAINT AND RESPONSIBILITY NEVER EARNED US ANY APPROBATION. SELECTIVE SANCTIONS ONLY SERVED TO DEGRADE OUR CONVENTIONAL CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCED A TOTALLY UNTENABLE SECURITY EQUATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  THE EVIDENT SELECTIVITY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE GLOBAL NON- PROLIFERATION GOALS, WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY PROBLEMS THAT IMPEL PROLIFERATION, HAD INCENSED OUR PEOPLE.  AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AT WHICH OUR VERY LIFE AND EXISTENCE ARE AT STAKE, THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN WERE UNANIMOUS IN DEMANDING THAT WE SEEK TO RECTIFY THE STRATEGIC IMBALANCE RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION BY INDIA.  HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS AND LEFT WITH NO CHOICE, WE HAVE IN OUR SUPREME NATIONAL INTEREST DECIDED TO EXERCISE THE NUCLEAR OPTION.  THIS DECISION, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN WITH A HEAVY HEART, WAS NECESSITATED BY THE IMPERATIVES OF SELF-DEFENCE AND TO DETER AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE NEED FOR URGENT STEPS TO BRING ABOUT NUCLEAR STABILIZATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  I HAVE, THEREFORE, OFFERED TO DISCUSS WITH INDIA, ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE REGION AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  WE TRUST THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MAJOR POWERS WILL ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE NOT ONLY THE RESUMPTION OF THE PAKISTAN- INDIA TALKS BUT EARLY CONCLUSION OF MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RESTRAINTS, ACCOMPANIED BY CONFIDENCE ENHANCING MEASURES.  WE WOULD ALSO URGE YOU TO FULLY ENDORSE AND SUPPORT OUR PROPOSAL FOR A NON-AGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA, ON THE BASIS OF AN EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR DISPUTE.  I AM ALSO REQUESTING THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER G-8 COUNTRIES TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER COLLECTIVELY INITIATING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO URGENTLY ADDRESS STABILIZATION MEASURES SO AS TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND TO REDUCE THE DANGERS OF A NUCLEAR CONFLICT IN SOUTH ASIA.

SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. REASON 1.5(D).  1.   (C)  SUMMARY:  WITH HER RIVAL NAWAZ SHARIF IN DEEP POLITICAL TROUBLE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO IS SEEKING TO RESHAPE HER IMAGE AND REVIVE HER OWN TATTERED POLITICAL FORTUNES. IN A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON AUGUST 27, SHE CONDEMNED THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, ADVOCATED DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, CALLED FOR THE END OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN AN ALL-PARTY CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT WHEN AND IF THE NAWAZ REGIME FALLS .  WILLING ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER OWN MISTAKES, SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PORTRAY HERSELF TO A U.S. AUDIENCE AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, PRO-WESTERN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL FORCES AT LARGE IN THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY  2.   QNGERS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  ALTHOUGH NO FRIEND OF NAWAZ SHARIF, BENAZIR EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, DESPITE ITS OVERWHELMING PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, WAS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS PARTIES, PREEMINENTLY THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND THE JAMAAT-ULEMA-I-ISLAMI.  SHE FEARED THAT, IF THE SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY BEGAN TO BRING PEOPLE OUT INTO THE STREETS, THESE ELEMENTS WOULD MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH SYMPATHETIC RETIRED GENERALS FROM THE ZIA ERA TO SPEARHEAD A FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC TAKEOVER.  SHE NOTED THAT THE NEWSPAPERS WERE FULL OF ARTICLES BY INFLUENTIAL FORMER GENERALS MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  (COMMENT:  WE DOUBT SHE REALLY BELIEVES THAT HEADLINE-GRABBERS SUCH AS FORMER COAS MIRZA ALSAM BEG AND FORMER DG/ISI HAMEED GUL ARE A THREAT.)  3.   (C)  ON THE ARMY.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE ALSO PLENTY OF ACTIVE DUTY MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICERS SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST CAUSE.  THE TOP ARMY LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER, REMAINED SOLID AND MODERATE.  INDEED, SHE CONCEDED THAT ARMY INTERVENTION OF SOME SORT COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO AVERT A FUNDAMENTALIST TAKEOVER IF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO CRUMBLE. SHE THOUGHT THE ARMY COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE BY SETTING UP A TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING HER OWN PPP AND NAWAZ'S PML (WITHOUT NAWAZ, OF COURSE).  BUT SHE WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL THAT THE ARMY COULD RULE EFFECTIVELY ON ITS OWN BASED ON ITS PAST PERFORMANCE.  4.   (C) ON NAWAZ.  BENAZIR MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE HER DISLIKE OF NAWAZ SHARIF, WHOM SHE REGARDED AS BOTH WEAK AND NOT VERY BRIGHT. SHE APPEARED TO HARBOR AN EVEN GREATER DISLIKE FOR HIS BROTHER SHAHBAZ, WHO SHE CHARACTERIZED AS MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT ALSO MORE BRUTAL, RELATING A BRIEF ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW HE HAD ORDERED A HAPLESS BUREAUCRAT THROWN INTO A SEWER IN A MOMENT OF PERSONAL PIQUE.  INTERESTINGLY, SHE WAS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE NAWAZ'S GROWING FLIRTATION WITH ISLAMIZATION TO HIS OWN LIGHTS RATHER THAN SIMPLY TO POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM.  SHE CONTENDED THAT NAWAZ'S FATHER HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE TO \"TALIBANISH\" (HER WORD) ULEMA (RELIGIOUS LEADERS) IN LAHORE AND HAD INCULCATED THESE SORTS OF VALUES IN THE YOUNG NAWAZ.  SHE SAID THAT NAWAZ HAD DONE THE SAME TO HIS OWN SON, NOTING THAT THE YOUNGER SHARIF HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS AGE WHEN INTERVIEWED RECENTLY ON TELEVISION IN KEEPING WITH A CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SUPERSTITION.  5.   (C) ON HER OWN MISTAKES.  ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO DIFFQHAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, BENAZIR SAID SQ WOULD ENDED THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM THAT LAID THE BASIS FOR THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF HER AS CORRUPT.  SHE LAMENTED THAT THERE HAD DEVELOPED IN PAKISTAN A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH INCOMING GOVERNMENT PACKED THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH ITS OWN CRONIES.  THIS WAS A RECIPE FOR BOTH INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION. SHE HAD BEEN AS GUILTY OF THE PRACTICE AS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT LEADER BUT NO MORE SO.  SHE NOTED THAT SHE HAD YET TO BE CONVICTED ON ANY CORRUPTION CHARGE DESPITE TWO YEARS OF GOVERNMENT DIGGING.  NONETHELESS, THE PRACTICE OF PATRONAGE WAS DESTRUCTIVE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE.  THIS WOULD BE A KEY ELEMENT OF HER POLICY WERE SHE EVER TO RETURNQT: DURING THIS EXCHANGE, SHE DID NOT MENTION HER HUSBAND, WHO WAS HER CHIEF BAG MAN AND PATRONAGE DISPENSER.)  6.   (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. HER CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES WAS STANDARD FARE. SHE SAID THE EFFORT TO FORCE THE INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS (IPPS) TO RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS SIGNED BY HER REGIME HAD HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR GOVERNMENTS TO HONOR THE AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR PREDECESSORS EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE THE TERMS.  OTHERWISE, THE PREDICTABILITY AND CONFIDENCE SO ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT WOULD BE LACKING.  BENAZIR WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FREEZE HARD CURRENCY ACCOUNTS IN THE WAKE OF ITS NUCLEAR TESTS.  SHE BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO CLUE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION SAVE FOR BEGGING FROM RICH ARAB NEIGHBORS AND THROWING ITSELF ON THE MERCY OF THE IMF.  7.   (C) ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HER OWN PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION TO PROFESSIONALIZING THE CIVIL SERVICE, BENAZIR SAID SHE STRONGLY FAVORED DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS.  GOVERNMENT-OWNED ENTERPRISES SHOULD BE SOLD OFF AND THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND BUREAUCRATS SHARPLY REDUCED.  THE MILITARY BUDGET WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE REDUCED.  PAKISTAN COULD NOT PRETEND TO MATCH INDIA SOLDIER FOR SOLDIER AND MACHINE FOR MACHINE AND WOULD NEED TO TAILOR ITS FOREIGN POLICY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS REALITY. AS FOR THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, SHE SAID SHE FAVORED SHUTTING DOWN THE MADARASSA SCHOOLS THAT WERE CHURNING OUT SO MANY YOUNG FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HER BASIC THEME, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT FUNDAMENTALISM WAS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY BY ENDING CORRUPTION, DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AND ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  8.   (C) ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  BENAZIR TOLD POLCOUNS SHE HAD SEEN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD AGREED TO SIGN THE CTBT DURING THE SHAMSHAD-TALBOTT TALKS IN LONDON ON AUGUST 25.  SHE HOPED THIS WAS TRUE, SINCE PAKISTAN COULD NOT AFFORD A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE WITH INDIA OR BAD RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  SHE SAID THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT FLOWING FROM THE MAY NUCLEAR TESTS WAS ITS IMPACT ON THE U.S. THE TESTS HAD FORCED THE UNITED STATES TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN NEEDED ACTIVE U.S. ENGAGEMENT AND SHE HOPED THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE REGION.  9.   (C) ON THE TALIBAN AND BIN LADEN.  BENAZIR SAID SHE HAD STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS AND WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM OF ANY KIND.  BUT SHE FELT THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE PURSUED USAMA BIN LADEN THROUGH THE UN PROCESS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE AUGUST 20 CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES HAD ALIENATED PUBLIC OPINION THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  SHE SAID SHE WAS NO FAN OF THE TALIBAN, WHOM SHE VIEWED AS AN EXTENSION OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  INDEED, SHE WAS FEARFUL THAT RETURNING TALIBAN MIGHT SERVE AS FOOT SOLDIERS FOR RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS IN A FUTURE CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES.  10.  (C) ON WHAT IS GOING RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  DESPITE HER OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND FEAR OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, BENAZIR SAID SHE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN MANY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN PAKISTAN IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE DEATH OF ZIA (AUGUST 17, 1988) AND RETURN OF DEMOCRACY.  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD FELT ITS STING MORE THAN ANY OTHER PAKISTANI POLITICIAN, SHE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PAKISTAN HAD DEVELOPED A REMARKABLY FREE PRESS, WHICH SHE BELIEVED WAS AN ESSENTIAL UNDERPINNING OF GENUINE DEMOCRACY.  SHE SAID SHE ALSO BELIEVED THAT THE JUDICIARY HAD ACHIEVED A LARGE MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM POLITICAL AUTHORITIES.  SHE ALSO THOUGHT THAT ORDINARY PAKISTANIS HAD BEGUN TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND TO QUESTION WHAT THEY WERE TOLD BY THE GOVERNMENT AND BY POLITICIANS RATHER THAN PASSIVELY ACCEPT SIMPLISTIC SLOGANS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE.  11.  (C) ON HER CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THE WEAKNESS OF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT HAD IMPROVED HER OWN POLITICAL POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRONG IN RURAL AREAS, BUT REMAINED WEAK IN URBAN PUNJAB.  SHE RUED THE FACT THAT THE ELECTORAL WEAKNESS OF HER OWN PPP PARTY (REDUCED IN THE LAST ELECTION TO ITS SINDHI BASE) HAD FORCED HER TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER, MORE EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS PARTIES UNDER THE  PAKISTAN AWAMI ITIHAT (PAI) UMBRELLA.  BUT SHE FELT THAT HER PARTY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF OPPOSITION ON ITS OWN.  MORE RECENTLY, SHE HAD ALSO BEGAN REACHING OUT TO SOME OF THE NATIONALIST REGIONAL PARTIES, SUCH AS THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE-BASED ANP.  HOWEVER, WHEN ASKED HOW SHE COULD MANEUVER FROM WHERE SHE WAS NOW BACK INTO A POSITION OF POWER HER ONLY COMMENT WAS A RUEFUL \"THAT IS THE 64 DOLLAR QUESTION.\"  12.  (C) COMMENT.  BENAZIR WAS RELAXED AND TALKATIVE DURING A CONVERSATION THAT STRETCHED ON FOR NINETY MINUTES.  HER COMMENTS WERE CLEARLY CALCULATED TO GO DOWN WELL WITH AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE AND SHE CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING HERSELF AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, MORE WESTERN-ORIENTED ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND ITS EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALIST FOES.  SHE HAS RECENTLY TURNED FOR ADVICE TO A MODERATE FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, RETIRED GENERAL TALAT MASOOD, WHO IS NOTED FOR PROMOTING THE NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN PAKISTAN.  AS FOR WHETHER BENAZIR BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING, THAT IS HARD TO SAY.  HER BEST CHANCE OF ONE DAY RETURNING TO POWER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY AS PART OF A COALITION RATHER THAN ON HER OWN.  THAT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD THING, GIVEN THAT, LEFT STRICTLY TO HER OWN DEVICES, SHE WOULD REMAIN BEHOLDEN TO THE LANDLORDS OF HER FEUDAL SINDH BASE, AND THESE ARE NOT THE SORT OF PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENDING PATRONAGE AND PROMOTING INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REFORMS.

(C) SUMMARY.  MEETING OCTOBER 14 WITH VISITING AMBASSADOR MILAM, PUNJAB CHIEF MINISTER SHAHBAZ SHARIF EMPHASIZED HIS BROTHER'S COMMITMENT TO FINDING COMMON GROUND WITH THE UNITED STATES ON PROLIFERATION ISSUES, JUSTIFIED THE RECENT REDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS AS A POLITICAL IMPERATIVE, AND DEFENDED THE GOVERNMENT'S ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT AS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT WOULD NOT ALTER PAKISTAN'S HISTORICALLY MODERATE COURSE.  SHAHBAZ RECALLED HIS MID-AUGUST MEETINGS WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, AND CLAIMED THAT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE ROADMAP WHICH HE HAD DISCUSSED.  HE PROMISED IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON EXPORT CONTROLS BUT INDICATED THAT FURTHER MOVEMENT TOWARDS A FISSILE MATERIAL CUT-OFF WOULD REQUIRE STEPS TO REDRESS THE INHERENT IMBALANCE OF THE INDO-PAK SECURITY RELATIONSHIP.  IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE OSAMA BIN LADEN ISSUE IN AFGHANISTAN, URGED SHAHBAZ TO SPEAK TO THE PM ABOUT INCREASING GOP EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL AND ABOUT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY'S RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW THE AMBASSADOR TO ENGAGE THE PM ON AFGHANISTAN.  SHAHBAZ AGREED TO TALK TO THE PM.  END SUMMARY.   THE WAY FORWARD ON NON-PROLIFERATION ------------------------------------  2. (C) AFTER A FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTETAKER WAS ESCORTED OUT OF THE MEETING, SHAHBAZ SPOKE CANDIDLY AND AT LENGTH ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES AND ITS HOPES FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY, THE CHIEF MINISTER LAMENTED, BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO GET BACK ON COURSE TO FOCUS ON PAKISTAN'S URGENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS.  3. (C) RECALLING HIS LATE SUMMER MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED THAT GOP ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE \"ROAD MAP\" THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT. WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE FOR US TO DO, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  SOME STEPS, SUCH AS ENHANCING EXPORT CONTROLS, WE WOULD TAKE EVEN WITHOUT YOUR PRESSURE.  THIS IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  OTHER STEPS, INCLUDING THE FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF, REQUIRE THAT WE FIRST DETERMINE HOW TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM DETERRENCE VIS-A-VIS INDIA.  WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT INDIA IS THE AGGRESSOR WHICH STARTED THE CYCLE OF NUCLEAR TESTING.  IT FRUSTRATES US, SHAHBAZ ADDED, THAT FRIENDS LIKE THE UNITED STATES SOMETIMES APPEAR TO OVERLOOK THIS BASIC FACT.  WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING IN GENEVA, BUT UNCONDITIONAL PAKISTANI ADHERENCE TO THE FMCT IS A PROBLEM.  WE MUST FIND A WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCKPILES AND BRING SOME FORM OF PARITY TO OUR SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA, SHAHBAZ CONCLUDED.  4. (C) THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE THREE PARTNERS IN THESE DELIBERATIONS, AMBASSADOR MILAM RESPONDED.  BUT WE THINK FMCT IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD.  BOTH PAKISTAN AND INDIA NEED TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THEIR NUCLEAR POLICIES.  SHAHBAZ AGAIN CAME BACK TO THE POLITICS OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION DEBATE. NAWAZ SHARIF MUST BE SEEN TO BE DEFENDING PAKISTAN'S SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS.  FOR THAT REASON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED, WHATEVER STEPS ARE REQUIRED AND WHATEVER INDUCEMENTS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PROVIDES MUST BE VIEWED AS EQUITABLE AND FAIR.   SOUTH ASIA'S KOSOVO -------------------  5. (C) SHAHBAZ TURNED TO THE BROADER ISSUE OF INDO-PAK RELATIONS, NOTING THAT \"WE'D BE LIVING IN A FOOLS PARADISE\" TO SEEK PROGRESS ON NON-PROLIFERATION WHILE IGNORING THE CONFRONTATION OVER KASHMIR.  THIS WAS NOT WHAT INDIA AND PAKISTAN WERE MEANT TO BE, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED, FIGHTING PROXY WARS AND SQUANDERING EACH OTHER'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  LOOK AT TRADE.  THINK HOW MUCH WE COULD SAVE IF PAKISTAN WERE ABLE TO BUY COAL FROM INDIAN MINES INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT FROM THE AMERICAS.  BUT THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE CAN MOVE THE RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL, BUT WE NEED YOU TO THROW YOUR WEIGHT BEHIND A SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.  AS YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO, THE UNITED STATES MUST BRING IT'S AUTHORITY TO BEAR ON THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.   THE POWER IMBROGLIO -------------------  6. (C) AMBASSADOR MILAM RAISED THE ISSUE OF INDEPENDENT POWER PROVIDERS (IPP'S), NOTING OUR PUZZLEMENT ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN CONSUMER ELECTRICITY RATES COMING IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF.  WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE ELECTRICITY TARIFFS, SHAHBAZ INSISTED.   FROM KHYBER TO KARACHI, PAKISTANIS WERE CLAMORING FOR RELIEF FROM UTILITY BILLS THAT WERE CONSUMING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOMES.  PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.  THIS GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF REVERSING THE MARKET-ORIENTED DIRECTION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SET IN HIS FIRST MONTHS; THAT'S NOT EVEN AN PEOPLE A SENSE OF HOPE.   THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT -----------------------  7. (U) AS THE CONVERSATION DREW TO A CLOSE, THE CHIEF MINISTER RAISED THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON ISLAMIZATION.  YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT UP, SO I WILL, SHAHBAZ NOTED.  THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT'S WESTERN, LIBERAL ORIENTATION.  THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN WEARING ALL MY OLD WESTERN BUSINESS SUITS, HE JOKED, INSTEAD OF THE SHALWAR THAT MOST PAKISTANI POLITICIANS TREAT AS THEIR UNIFORM.  SHAHBAZ ALSO DREW ATTENTION HIS OCTOBER 14 SPEECH AT A WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION MEETING IN LAHORE WHERE HE HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE THAT FEMALE MANAGERS, ADMINISTRATORS AND SCIENTISTS MUST PLAY IN PAKISTAN'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  CAN WE THINK OF DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING WOMEN WHO WEAR A VEIL OR SIT AT HOME, SHAHBAZ ASKED IN HIS SPEECH. IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE.  8. (U) THERE SHOULD BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR REASONS FOR ADVANCING THE 15TH AMENDMENT, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  AFTER WESTERN PRESSURE ON CTBT AND THE AIR STRIKES ON AFGHANISTAN, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES WERE RIDING HIGH.  BUT THIS ONE ACTION OF INTRODUCING THE ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT HAS TAKEN THE WIND OUT OF THEIR SAILS.  9.  (C) IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED HIS INCREASING PREOCCUPATION WITH AFGHANISTAN, AND ESPECIALLY THE ISSUE OF THE TALEBAN HARBORING OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE TO THE U.S., AND OUR SENSE IS THAT, PERHAPS, WITH ADDED PUSH THE U.S., PAKISTAN AND SAUDI ARABIA CAN PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL.  WE NEED A STRONGER PUSH ON THIS BY THE GOP.  THE AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO SEE THE PM ON THIS BUT WAS BEING SCREENED OFF BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SHAHBAZ TO TALK TO THE PM ABOUT THIS.  THE CHIEF MINISTER SAID HE WOULD.  COMMENT -------  10. (C) IN BOTH THIS MEETING AND A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH WITH HIS SENIOR ADVISORS, SHAHBAZ DISPLAYED THE MIXTURE OF IMPATIENCE AND REFORMIST ZEAL THAT HAVE BECOME HIS HALLMARK.  COMPARED EVEN TO THE LAST MEETING WITH HIM IN LATE AUGUST (REFTEL), WE FOUND HIM MORE CONVERSANT AND MORE WILLING TO VENTURE AN OPINION ON THE SECURITY ISSUES THAT FORM THE CORE OF THE U.S.-PAKISTAN BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  IMPLICIT IN THE SCOPE OF OUR TWO HOUR CONVERSATION AND LUNCH WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT PROGRESS ON NON- PROLIFERATION AND THE RELATED SANCTIONS, THE EXPERIMENT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM THAT SHAHBAZ HAS LAUNCHED IN PUNJAB (LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF) MAY COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND. END COMMENT.   MILAM " }

SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON 1.5(D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH A SAMPLING OF RURAL PUNJABI POLITICIANS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT RECRUITMENT TO MILITANT RELIGIOUS GROUPS IS INCREASING IN POORER AREAS OF THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE (PRIMARILY SOUTHERN PUNJAB), BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING.  THESE SAME SOURCES ALSO CONTEND THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN ARE HIGHLY POPULAR AMONG POORLY EDUCATED PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS (AND PROBABLY URBAN AREAS AS WELL).  SUCH POPULARITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED, BUT EXISTS AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, REFLECTING THE NEED FOR SUCCESSFUL ROLE MODELS ON THE PART OF ORDINARY MUSLIMS FED UP WITH THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO MEET BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL A, POLCOUNS HAS RECENTLY SPOKEN WITH THREE PML MNAS REPRESENTING RURAL CONSTITUENCIES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  THE THREE ARE MUMTAZ AHMED TARAR, A NAWAZ SHARIF LOYALIST WHO SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SERVICES COMMITTEE, COL (R) GHULAM SARWAR CHEEMA, A PARTY SWITCHING FORMER PPP MINISTER OF STATE WHO NOW SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE COMMITTEE, AND SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, A LIBERAL-MINDED MNA NOW SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, TO WHOM POLCOUNS PAID A REPEAT VISIT.  THE SUBJECT WAS SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE TALIBAN IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  3.  (C) IN THE JUDGMENT OF POLCOUNS, TARAR WAS THE MOST COMPELLING WITNESS.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION, HE CONTENDED THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM (DEFINED AS SUPPORT FOR MILITANT RELIGIOUS GROUPS) IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ONLY IN RURAL DISTRICTS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE LANDHOLDINGS (I.E., QUASI-FEUDAL AREAS), WHERE THERE WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE NOTS.  THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY IN THESE REGIONS HELPED TO FUEL EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES.  HE CITED THE MULTAN, BAHAWALPUR, MIANWALI AND SARGHODA AREAS AS EXAMPLES.  IN OTHER DISTRICTS, WHERE SMALL LANDHOLDERS PREVAIL AND THERE IS A FUNCTIONING MIDDLE CLASS, THERE ARE FEWER SOCIAL TENSIONS AND EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES ARE HELD BY ONLY BY A FEW.  HIS OWN DISTRICT, MANDI BAHAUDIN IN CENTRAL PUNJAB, FELL INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY.  LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BELONGED TO MILITANT GROUPS, USUALLY THE SUNNI SECTARIAN SIPAH-E-SAHABA PAKISTAN (SSP).  4.  (C) TARAR SAID THE CASE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE BELIEVED THAT UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN HIS DISTRICT AND, INDEED, THROUGHOUT URBAN AND RURAL PUNJAB, HAVE A HIGHLY FAVORABLE OPINION OF BOTH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE OPINED THAT BIN LADEN IS THE HERO OF THE MOMENT IN PAKISTAN AND WOULD WIN ANY ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ANY WELLSPRING OF FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE NOT PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS.  IT WAS DUE RATHER TO THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN APPEARED TO ORDINARY FOLK AS ISLAMIC HEROES WHO HAD NOT ONLY STOOD UP TO THE ANTI-ISLAMIC WEST BUT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SO DOING.  THIS WAS A HEADY CONTRAST TO THE PERCEIVED INEFFECTUALITY OF THEIR OWN LEADERS.  5.  (C) TARAR ADDED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE 15TH AMENDMENT WAS SIMILARLY WIDESPREAD IN HIS DISTRICT.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO RELIGIOUS CONVICTION, BUT BECAUSE HIS CONSTITUENTS BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD EMPOWER THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING SWIFT JUSTICE AND LAW AND ORDER TO THE COUNTRY.  DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN IN RURAL AREAS, TARAR SAW LITTLE DANGER THAT PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE COULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE MILITANT ACTION.  THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE AND TOO REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS OF POWER.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS WERE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON OBTAINING GOVERNMENT LOANS WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY AGENTS TO SMUGGLE THEM INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  HE ESTIMATED THAT FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE WORKING OR HAD WORKED ABROAD.  THE REAL DANGER CAME FROM THE URBAN AREAS, WHERE THERE WAS A MUCH LARGER CADRE OF FUNDAMENTALIST RABBLE ROUSERS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY MOBILIZE LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE.  6.  (C) THE URBANE, HIGHLY POLISHED COL CHEEMA REPRESENTS A RURAL PUNJABI CONSTITUENCY NEAR GUJRANWALA AND OWNS PROPERTY IN THREE OTHERS (NEAR LAHORE, FAISALABAD AND JHANG).  HE WAS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIONISTIC AND LESS SPECIFIC IN HIS OWN VIEWS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM IN RURAL PUNJAB.  HIS OWN BELIEF WAS THAT THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE PEOPLE HAD DESTROYED THE FAITH OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS IN THE ABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL CLASS (MILITARY AND CIVILIAN) TO PROVIDE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND SATISFY BASIC ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NEEDS.  THIS, IN TURN, HAD MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALTERNATIVE MESSAGES, SUCH AS THOSE CONVEYED TWO DECADES AGO BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND, MORE RECENTLY, BY THE TALIBAN.  7.  (C) RICH WITH ANECDOTES, HE TOLD THE STORY OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO HAD COME TO HIM FOR HELP DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HIS DISTRICT.  ALTHOUGH THE ONLY ELECTRICAL ITEM IN HER ONE ROOM HOUSE WAS A LIGHT BULB HER BILL AMOUNTED TO 3000 RUPEES (60 DOLLARS, A FORMIDABLE SUM).  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD A FAN, SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO RUN IT.  CHEEMA SAID THAT, WHILE HE HAD MANAGED TO GET HER BILL REDUCED TO 2500 RUPEES, THE WOMAN WAS TYPICAL OF THE CASES HE GETS DURING HIS WEEKLY AUDIENCES WITH CONSTITUENTS.  HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF INCREASING POVERTY, WHICH MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS MESSAGES.  8.  (C) CHEEMA ALSO BEMOANED THE MANY FUNDAMENTALIST MADRASSAS (RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS) THAT HAD SPRUNG UP RECENTLY.  HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE SON OF A CONSTITUENT WHO HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO DROP OUT OF STANFORD BY A VISITING PAKISTANI \"TABLIGHI\" (LAY ISLAMIC PROSELYTIZER) AND RETURN TO PAKISTAN TO ENROLL IN A MADRASSA NEAR LAHORE.  HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LOST TO HIS FAMILY, WHO STRUGGLED TO GAIN PERMISSION TO SEE HIM AND RECEIVED FOR THEIR TROUBLES A PERFUNCTORY HELLO AND GOOD-BYE.  HIS SENSE WAS THAT RECRUITMENT TO RADICAL MADRASSAS HAD BEEN SHARPLY ON THE INCREASE RECENTLY, SERVING AS A MAGNET FOR DISAFFECTED YOUTH.  MUHAMMAD KHALID MASUD, PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, ECHOED THIS IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON OCTOBER 24 CONTENDING THAT EXTREMIST VIEWS WERE COMING TO DOMINATE THE ENTIRE MADRASSA SYSTEM.  9.  (C) CHEEMA SAID IT WAS HIS SENSE THAT SUCH TRENDS WERE FRAYING AT THE VERY FABRIC OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY, CAUSING THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.  SWITCHING METAPHORS, HE LIKENED PAKISTAN TO A DRIED OUT BALE OF HAY THAT NEEDED ONLY THE SLIGHTEST OF SPARKS TO SET IT ALIGHT.  NOTING THE SHARP INCREASE IN SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND APPEARANCE OF MYRIAD SECTS ALL HOLDING THEIR OWN MONOPOLIES ON THE TRUTH, HE FEARED THAT ONCE THE SPARK WAS LIT ALL THESE GROUPS WOULD BE AT EACH OTHERS THROATS.  LOOKING AT POLCOUNS RUEFULLY, HE COMMENTED THAT WHILE POLCOUNS WOULD SERVE IN PAKISTAN FOR ONLY A YEAR OR TWO, HE AND HIS COUNTRYMEN WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN BEHIND.  10.  (C) IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH TARAR AND CHEEMA, POLCOUNS ALSO PAID A RETURN VISIT TO SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, WHO HAD EARLIER REPORTED A SHARP INCREASE IN FUNDAMENTALISM AND PRO- TALIBAN SENTIMENT IN HIS RURAL PUNJABI DISTRICT (REFTEL B). TAMMAN DID NO BACKING AWAY FROM HIS EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM TAKING HOLD IN HIS DISTRICT.  HE SAID THE POVERTY IN HIS DISTRICT HAD HELPED ATTRACT CONVERTS TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  AKRAM AWAN, A MIDDLE CLASS LANDLORD AND FOUNDER OF THE RADICAL AKHAN UL MUSLIMIN PARTY, ALSO HAILS FROM HIS DISTRICT. LIKE TARAR HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT, SINCE THE U.S. CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN, THE FORMERLY UNKNOWN OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BECOME A CELEBRITY AND SOMETHING OF A FOLK HERO AMONG THE ORDINARY PEOPLE IN HIS DISTRICT.  11.  (C) SOME OF THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN NOTED BY CONSULATE LAHORE.  PO WAS STRUCK BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FLAGS, BANNERS AND SLOGANS FOR THE JIHADIST LASHKAR-E-TAIBA (LT) HE NOTED IN SAHIWAL DISTRICT DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HARAPPA.  THIS GROUP SPECIALIZES IN RECRUITING YOUNG PUNJABIS TO FIGHT IN KASHMIR.  CONSULATE CONTACTS HAVE ALSO NOTED A CONTINUING STRENGTHENING IN SUPPORT FOR THE SSP IN RURAL PARTS OF KHANEWAL, TOBA TEK SINGH AND MULTAN DISTRICTS.  THE SSP ALSO RECENTLY CAPTURED CONTROL OF THE JHANG MUNICIPALITY (ITS URBAN BIRTHPLACE) ALTHOUGH THE RURAL JHANG HINTERLAND REMAINS FIRMLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE LOCAL SHIA LANDLORD.  ACCORDING TO CONSULATE LAHORE, MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE SSP AND THE LT APPEAR TO BE EXPANDING THEIR SUPPORT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS PARTIES, SUCH AS JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND JAMAAT-ULEMA-I- ISLAM.  12.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD A CLEAR PICTURE OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE BASED ON A SMALL HANDFUL OF CONVERSATIONS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT DEVELOPING IN THE RURAL AREAS.  OUR SENSE, RATHER, IS THAT THE CONTINUING DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IS FUELING A STEADY INCREASE IN THE RECRUITMENT OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE INTO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS LIKE THE SSP IN AREAS OF RURAL PUNJAB (PRIMARILY THE SOUTH) WHERE POVERTY BITES THE HARDEST.  IN RAISING A RED FLAG, TAMMAN IS PROBABLY REACTING MORE TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY OF A LOCAL MILITANT GROUP WITH PRO-TALIBAN SYMPATHIES THAN TO A LARGESCALE INCREASE IN NUMBERS.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE DANGER IS NOT THAT RURAL PUNJAB IS TURNING FUNDAMENTALIST, BUT THAT RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS ARE MAKING INROADS HERE JUST AS IN URBAN AREAS, FRAYING GRADUALLY BUT INEXORABLY AT THE STABILITY OF THE STATE.  13.  COMMENT CONT.  AS FOR THE ALLEGED WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE, OUR INSTINCTS TELL US THIS MAY WELL BE CORRECT, BUT FOR THE REASONS CITED BY TARAR.  SUCH ATTITUDES DO NOT REFLECT RADICAL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT OR EVEN ACTIVIST POLITICAL SUPPORT BUT OPERATE AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, WITH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN VIEWED AS A SUCCESSFUL ISLAMIC ROLE MODELS.  (PUNJABIS, AFTER ALL, ARE MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN KASHMIR THAN IN AFGHANISTAN.)  14.  COMMENT CONT.  NONETHELESS, THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN CAN FUNCTION AS CULTURAL ICONS IS CLEARLY AN INDICTMENT OF THE PAKISTANI POLITICAL CLASS, WHICH HAS MISERABLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EITHER GOOD GOVERNMENT OR POSITIVE ROLE MODELS.  IT IS ALSO AN INDICATION OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS TO ANTI-WESTERN PROPAGANDA, ITSELF NOURISHED BY THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER THE GOODS, BUT REFLECTING ALSO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF YEARS OF WHAT HAS BEEN PERCEIVED HERE AS ANTI-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES. END COMMENT.   MILAM " }

CLASSIFIED BY PUBLIC DIPLOMACY COUNSELOR RICHARD HOAGLAND FOR REASONS 1.5(D)  2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IT IS OUR IMPRESSION THAT THE USG IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT PROJECTING PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON USAMA BIN LADIN (UBL).  WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WASHINGTON CONSIDER A REVIEW OF THIS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------- PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS ---------------------  2.  (C)  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS:  --  THE PRO-TALIBAN AL-RASHID TRUST IN KARACHI CONTINUES TO CHURN OUT PRO-UBL -- AND CORRESPONDINGLY ANTI-U.S./ANTI-WESTERN -- BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND POSTERS IN URDU, ENGLISH, AND AFGHAN LANGUAGES AT NOMINAL COST OR FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION.  E.G., THE TRUST RECENTLY INTRODUCED A 3' X 2' FOUR- COLOR PRO-UBL POSTER WITH PHOTOS, MAPS, AND IDEOLOGICAL TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR 15 RUPEES, ABOUT 30 CENTS -- JUST A BIT MORE THAN THE COST OF A SIDEWALK HAIRCUT.  THIS POSTER BEAT THE USG'S UBL \"WANTED\" POSTER TO THE STREET.  --  WE FREQUENTLY HEAR REPORTS THAT SOME IN THE LOWER-MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES, BOTH URBAN AND RURAL, CONSIDER UBL AN ISLAMIC HERO BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS NAMED HIM \"PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.\"  THAT SAID, IT'S OUR IMPRESSION THAT THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS, AT LEAST IN PAKISTAN, DO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT THIS VIEW.  THE PENDING USG DISTRIBUTION OF UBL \"WANTED\" POSTERS AND MATCHBOOKS IN PAKISTAN MAY INCREASE UBL'S STATURE AS A KIND OF FOLK HERO.  --  U.S. AND BRITISH EFFORTS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TERRORISTS, LIKE BIN LADIN, AND \"GOOD MUSLIMS\" ARE SOMETIMES PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA AND BY RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN THEIR WRITINGS AND SERMONS AS ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE ALL MUSLIMS BY CO-OPTING WESTERNIZED -- MEANING (TO THEM) \"MORALLY CORRUPT\" -- MODERATES.  (NOTE:  THIS REPRESENTS THE PHILOSOPHICALLY ROMANTIC VIEW THAT ISLAM PER SE ERASES ALL DIVISIONS, THAT THE MUSLIM UMMAH IS \"ONE,\" AND THAT AN ATTACK ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.  END NOTE.)  --    IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR ORDINARY EXECRABLE PUBLIC RELATIONS PERFORMANCE ON THE BIN LADEN QUESTION, THE TALIBAN HAVE PRE- EMPTED US CONSISTENTLY SINCE AUGUST, FIRST BY ANNOUNCING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE AFGHANISTAN;S SUPREME COURT EXAMINE THE CHARGES AGAINST BIN LADIN AND THEN BY ANNOUNCING THAT NO \"EVIDENCE\" (BY WHICH THEY MEANT HARD FACTS IN PROOF OF THE CHARGES) HAD BEEN PRESENTED.  OUR RESPONSE IN EACH CASE WAS MUTED AND DELAYED.  CONTINUING THIS TREND ON THE TALIBAN'S PART, EARLY IN JANUARY, THE TALIBAN SPONSORED A SEMINAR IN KABUL, REPORTED BY RADIO SHARIA, ON THE LIFE, TIMES, AND THOUGHTS OF UBL (REFTEL).   --  ACCORDING TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, PAKISTANI TALIBS WHO HAVE SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN, ALONG WITH AFGHAN TALIBS, ARE BEGINNING TO ENFORCE THEIR DOGMAS AND SOCIAL CONTROLS IN PAKISTAN'S TRIBAL TERRITORIES AND IN SOME PLACES IN BALOCHISTAN AND NWFP PROVINCES.  ALSO, LAST WEEK, THE GOP ENFORCED ISLAMIC LAW BY DECREE IN MALAKAND DIVISION AND IN A PART OF KOHISTAN.  ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED AS YET, THEY SUGGEST A DISTURBING TREND.  INDEED, THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE PAKISTANI CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHING SHARIA AS THE SUPREME LAW OF PAKISTAN -- AN AVOWEDLY HIGH PRIORITY OF THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT -- HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND IS PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE.  -------------------- WHAT SHOULD BE DONE? --------------------  4.  (C) WE ARE UNLIKELY EVER TO MAKE MUCH INROAD WITH UBL'S HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE-BELIEVER ABSOLUTISTS AND TEND TO THINK AND REACT LARGELY EMOTIONALLY:  FACTS ARE LESS IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN EMOTIONS.  THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO PERSUASION.  FURTHER, WE FACE A FORMIDABLE FOE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE CHURNING OUT AND WIDELY DISSEMINATING PRO-UBL PROPAGANDA AND TAKING OTHER ACTIVE MEASURES.  5.  (C) HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LARGE MIDDLE GROUND, IN PAKISTAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN, WHICH IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ANTI- U.S./ANTI-WESTERN AND WHICH IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO UBL AND HIS PAN- ISLAMIST REVOLUTION.  THIS MIDDLE GROUND, SOMEWHAT SUSCEPTIBLE TO REASON, OR AT LEAST TO OTHER INFORMATION, SHOULD BE OUR PRIMARY TARGET.  THE MESSAGE CRAFTED FOR THEM WOULD ALSO BE WELCOMED BY THE EDUCATED, WESTWARD- LOOKING ELITE OF BOTH PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN WHO FEEL THREATENED BY UBL'S ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE AND THEOLOGICAL OBSCURANTISM.  6.  (C) THE FOCUS OF ANY ENHANCED USG PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD BE TO PORTRAY UBL AND OTHERS AROUND HIM AS CRIMINALS, BOTH BY INTERNATIONAL AND BY ISLAMIC STANDARDS. WHERE POSSIBLE, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MOVEMENT \"AL-QAIDA\" SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED, NOT JUST UBL AS AN INDIVIDUAL.  --  WHEN WE FOCUS ON BIN LADIN, AND ESPECIALLY FOR AFGHAN CONSUMPTION, WE SHOULD MAKE THREE POINTS:  1) THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST AFGHANISTAN AND THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, 2) THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR AFGHAN POLITICAL FACTION, AND 3) THE U.S. WANTS UBL EXPELLED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO A PLACE WHERE HE CAN BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  --  THE BROADER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT COULD INCLUDE, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A \"CHARGE SHEET\" OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY UBL, BY HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES, AND BY HIS FOLLOWERS, NOTING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEIR VICTIMS HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  --  RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO PROTECT SOURCES AND METHODS AND NOT TO COMPROMISE ON-GOING INVESTIGATIONS AND JUDICIAL PROCESSES, WE SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS, AS WELL AS ABOUT UBL'S AND HIS MOVEMENT'S OTHER CRIMES.  --  THIS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE VALIDATION FROM ISLAMIC SOURCES THAT THESE CRIMES ARE INDEED RECOGNIZED AS CRIMES UNDER ISLAM.  RATHER THAN STATEMENTS BY U.S.- OR UK-BASED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS, IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO USE THE TEACHINGS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF MAJOR ISLAMIC SCHOLARS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, AND ELSEWHERE.  IN SELECTING/ELICITING SUCH CITATIONS, IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND THAT UBL AND THE PAN- ISLAMISTS DISMISS SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT AS ONLY NOMINALLY ISLAMIC STATES CAPTIVE TO U.S.-TOADYING, DESPOTIC, AND APOSTATE LEADERS.  --  KEEPING IN MIND THAT IN HIS DECEMBER 23 INTERVIEW UBL JUSTIFIED KILLING MUSLIMS IN HIS JIHAD AGAINST \"CRUSADERS AND JEWS,\" AND RECOGNIZING THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF OUR TARGET AUDIENCE, WE SHOULD PREPARE FOR DISSEMINATION MORE HUMAN INTEREST STORIES OF UBL'S VICTIMS, ESPECIALLY HIS MUSLIM VICTIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  U.S. MEDIA REPORTS OF BLINDED KENYANS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECEIVED GOOD COVERAGE IN THE PAKISTANI PRINT MEDIA.  7.  (7)  EFFECTIVE METHODS WOULD NATURALLY INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL USG PUBLIC DIPLOMACY TOOLS:  VOA LANGUAGE SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH UBL'S MUSLIM VICTIMS; CAREFULLY TARGETED WORLDNET INTERACTIVES; WIRELESS-FILE TEXTS AND FACT SHEETS FOR TRANSLATION INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES; AND COMMISSIONED ARTICLES FOR PRESS PLACEMENT.  8.  (C) CONSIDERATION COULD ALSO BE GIVEN TO PRODUCTION OF A BOOKLET IN LOCAL LANGUAGES ON THE CRIMES OF BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES, ALONG WITH VICTIMS' STORIES, FOR NON- CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION IN MOSQUES, MADRASSAS, ISLAMIC STUDY CENTERS, ISLAMIA DEPARTMENTS OF UNIVERSITIES, AND BOOKSTORES.  9.  (C) A NON-USG-IDENTIFIED WEB SITE COULD ALSO BE CREATED TO POST THE ABOVE MATERIAL AND THE URL WIDELY DISTRIBUTED.  ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE COUNTER-INTUITIVE -- THAT THE MASSES DON'T USE THE INTERNET -- ALMOST ALL ISLAMIC AND ISLAMIST GROUPS DO INDEED HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND USE IT EXTENSIVELY.
