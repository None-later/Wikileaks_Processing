(U) CLASSIFIED SECRET BY NEW DELHI ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR GORDON HELLWIG. REASON 1.5 (C).  2. (S) EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE MORE INFORMATION ON THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) AS REQUESTED IN REFTEL.  POST PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION, OBTAINED BY THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICE THROUGH ITS CONTACTS IN THE INDIAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU IN THE HOME MINISTRY, WHICH PROVIDED A WRITTEN REPORT ON THE JKIF.  POLOFFS HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE FROM CONTACTS IN KASHMIR VALLEY REGARDING THE JKIF, AS MOST OF THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE VALLEY.  NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE VARIOUS MILITANT GROUPS IN KASHMIR HAVE NEVER INCLUDED THE JKIF AS A MILITANT GROUP OF PROMINENCE IN KASHMIR.  BEGIN TEXT  (ENTIRE TEXT IS CONFIDENTIAL):  JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF)  THE GENESIS OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) DATES BACK TO 1989 WHEN ITS PRECURSOR, THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR STUDENTS LIBERATION FRONT (JKSLF), WAS FLOATED BY HILAL BEG FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES WITH YASIN MALIK, THE THEN COMMANDER- IN-CHIEF OF JKLF.  THE JKSLF INDULGED IN HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER CASES.  LATER IN APRIL 1991, HILAL BEG WAS PERSUADED BY PAKISTAN\'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (ISI) TO RENAME THE JKSLF AS IKHWAN-UL-MUSALMEEN (IUM).  THE IUM LED BY HILAL BEG WAS TASKED BY PAKISTAN ISI TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE JAMMU AND KASHMIR. FOR THIS PURPOSE, HILAL BEG CREATED A NETWORK OF HIS AGENTS IN CALCUTTA, BIHAR, ANDHRA PRADESH, KATHMANDU, AND DHAKA. THE ARREST OF FOUR MUSLIM TERRORISTS (INCLUDING 3 KASHMIRIS) IN OCTOBER 1993 AT HYDERABAD AND CALCUTTA REVEALED THE PLANS OF THE IUM TO STAGE BOMBAY-TYPE BLASTS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF INDIA BY RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND ORGANISING GROUPS OF SABOTEURS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE JKIF WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY ONE SAJJAD AHMED KENU, WHO WAS A WELL-KNOWN ACTIVIST OF THE IUM.  SAJJAD KENU HAD ESCAPED FROM SRINAGAR JAIL IN JUNE 1995 AND RESURFACED AS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE JKIF IN SEPTEMBER 1995. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE JKIF HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM ITS PAKISTAN-BASED LEADERSHIP TO CARRY OUT BOMB BLASTS OUTSIDE J&K, PARTICULARLY IN DELHI.  ON NOVEMBER 21, 1995, THE JKIF KINGPIN KHURSHEED AHMED, A.K.A. NAYEEM (SINCE KILLED), ENGINEERED A HIGH INTENSITY BLAST WITH THE HELP OF TWO SIKHS, NAMELY HARDEEP SINGH, A.K.A. NEELA, AND HIS BROTHER RAJINDER, CLOTH VENDORS IN SRINAGAR.  THIS EXPLOSION, IN THE CONNAUGHT PLACE AREA OF NEW DELHI, INJURED 23 PERSONS AND DAMAGED A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND SHOPS. BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1995, THE SAME SIKH MILITANTS ALSO CAUSED TWO SIMULTANEOUS GRENADE EXPLOSIONS NEAR THE RED FORT IN DELHI, INJURING 47 PERSONS.  THE JKIF ALSO CAUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSION IN SADAR BAZAR, DELHI, ON JANUARY 3, 1996, IN WHICH 7 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 36 INJURED.  THE JKIF WAS CONTROLLED FROM PAKISTAN BY PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER MEMON (PRIME ACCUSED IN THE BOMBAY BOMB BLAST CASES OF 1993).  THEIR CONTACT IN PAKISTAN-OCCUPIED KASHMIR WAS BILAL BEG, WHO WAS RUNNING AN INDOCTRINATION CAMP NEAR MUZAFFARABAD, FUNDED EXTENSIVELY BY THE ISI TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIA, ONE COLONEL FAROOQ OF PAKISTAN ISI TASKED BILAL BEG AND TIGER MEMON TO UTILISE KATHMANDU-BASED ACTIVISTS LATEEF AND JAVED KRAWAH TO SET OFF BLASTS IN DELHI BEFORE THE LOK SABHA [UPPER HOUSE OF THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT] ELECTIONS.  A TEAM OF COMMITTED JKIF CADRES WAS GIVEN A TWO WEEK SPECIALISED CAPSULE COURSE IN EXPLOSIVES NEAR THE AFGHAN BORDER IN MARCH-APRIL 1996.  ON MAY 21, 1996, THIS JKIF TEAM SET OFF A VERY HIGH INTENSITY EXPLOSION AT LAJPAT NAGAR, NEW DELHI, IN WHICH 13 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 40 OTHERS INJURED.  THE RDX USED IN THIS BLAST WAS BROUGHT FROM KATHMANDU.  ALTHOUGH OTHER ACCUSED, NAMELY FAROOQ KHAN, A.K.A. ANWAR SADAT LATIF, JAVED CHHOTA, MEHMOOD KILLE, NAZA (ALL KASHMIRIS) AND NAUSHAD (A DELHI MUSLIM) WERE ARRESTED, JAVED KRAWAH AND RIAZ, A.K.A. RIAZ MULLA, MANAGED TO ESCAPE. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS, JAVED KRAWAH IS IN PAKISTAN AT PRESENT.  THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION IN A RAJASTHAN ROADWAYS BUS NEAR DAUSA ON MAY 22, 1996 WAS ALSO ENGINEERED BY THE JKIF.  ANOTHER JKIF TEAM UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ABDUL GANI, A.K.A. ASSADULLAH, WAS SENT TO EXECUTE A BOMB BLAST IN AHMEDABAD.  THE BLAST WAS PREVENTED BY THE TIMELY ARREST OF TEAM MEMBERS IN AHMEDABAD AND THE SEIZURE OF THEIR HIGH GRADE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL.  JKIF AGAIN PLANNED A CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS IN DELHI BEFORE REPUBLIC DAY 1997 AT THE BEHEST OF PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER MEMON.  ONE FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, TASKED BY BILAL AHMED BEG AND JAVED KRAWAH IN PAKISTAN, WAS GIVEN 20 KG OF RDX AND MONEY IN KATHMANDU.  BEFORE HE COULD EXECUTE THE PLAN, FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, ALONG WITH GHULAM RASOOL MIR, A.K.A. GOGA, AIJAZ AHMED CHOUDHARY, NAZIR AHMED, AND MANZOOR AHMED DANPOSH, A.K.A. JAN, WERE ARRESTED IN KATHMANDU ON DECEMBER 11, 1996.  FOR ALL THESE VIOLENT ACTIVITIES, THE JKIF HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USING KATHMANDU AS ITS BASE WITH THE ACTIVE CONNIVANCE OF PAKISTAN ISI.  TO DISPATCH MEN AND MATERIAL, AND TO EXECUTE EXPLOSIONS IN INDIA, KATHMANDU WAS INVARIABLY MADE THE NODAL POINT AND JKIF EXPLOITED THE VULNERABLE KATHMANDU-BASED KASHMIRI BUSINESSMEN FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES SINCE THEY HAD A READYMADE AND CLEAN PAST.  JKIF KINGPIN JAVED KRAWAH HIMSELF USED TO RUN A CARPET BUSINESS IN KATHMANDU.  END TEXT  WISNER " }

(C)  SUMMARY:  INDIAN OFFICIAL REACTION TO PAKISTAN\'S RECENT FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE (REFTEL) HAS BEEN MEASURED THUS FAR.  THE NEWS OF THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST RAN SECOND TO THE CORONATION OF SONIA GANDHI AS THE NEW LEADER OF THE CONGRESS PARTY IN MOST NEWSPAPERS ON APRIL 7.  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES GAVE A COOL AND DELIBERATE STATEMENT TO A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEW DELHI ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 6, NOTING THAT INDIA HAD PRIOR INFORMATION OF THE TEST.  FERNANDES DREW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TEST FIRING OF THE MISSILE AND PRODUCTION, BUT HE AVOIDED ANY COMMENT ON INDIA\'S AGNI MISSILE PROGRAM. THE DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND SECURITY AFFAIRS (DISA) IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECENT SENIOR INTERAGENCY MEETING TO DISCUSS INDIA\'S RESPONSE TO THE MISSILE TEST.  END SUMMARY  PROMINENT COVERAGE--BUT RELATIVELY MILD REACTION --------------------------------------------- --- 2.  (U)  INDIAN NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION PROVIDED EXTENSIVE BUT NOT INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OF THE RECENT TEST OF PAKISTAN\'S GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE.  MOST OF THE PRESS STORIES DREW HEAVILY FROM INFORMATION RELEASED PUBLICLY BY PAKISTAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY AS WELL AS THEIR OWN DECIDEDLY INDIAN ACCOUNT OF FACTS, SUCH AS THE TIMES OF INDIA CLAIM THAT THE TEST WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE KAHUTA NUCLEAR RESEARCH LABORATORY. THIS EVENT HAS PROVIDED ANOTHER FORUM FOR PROMINENT HAWKS IN THE MEDIA--SUCH AS IDSA\'S DIRECTOR JASJIT SINGH--TO RENEW CALLS FOR INDIA\'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGNI BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.  OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE ALSO PORTRAYED THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST AS CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE U.S. HAS FAILED TO STOP COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND PAKISTAN IN BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY.  INDEED, MUCH OF THE INDIAN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THINKING SEEMS TO REFLECT THE INHERENT DISDAIN FOR PAKISTAN\'S SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, OF WHICH BRAHMIN HINDUS ARE CONVINCED COULD NOT PRODUCE SUCH A MISSILE INDEPENDENTLY.  3.  (U)  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES WAS THE GOI\'S MAIN SPOKESMAN FOR THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS ISSUE.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE APRIL 6, HE MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:  --   INDIA\'S OWN MISSILE PROGRAM IS CONTINUING. PRITHVI MISSILES ARE CAPABLE OF REACHING ANYWHERE IN PAKISTAN;  --   INDIA HAD PRIOR WARNING THAT ISLAMABAD HAD BEEN PREPARING TO TEST A MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE; HE DESCRIBED THE TEST AS NOT UNEXPECTED BUT OF A SERIOUS NATURE, ALTHOUGH INDIA AND PAKISTAN ARE NOT IN A WAR-LIKE SITUATION;  --   THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TESTING AND PRODUCTION; AND  --   IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN SINO-PAKISTANI MISSILE COOPERATION DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF MULTILATERAL CONTROL REGIMES.   SOME INSIGHTS FROM MEA ---------------------- 4.  (C)  POLOFF MET WITH AJIT KUMAR, DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS IN THE MINISTRY FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ON APRIL 7 (SEE SEPTEL FOR A DISCUSSION OF CWC ISSUES).  KUMAR CONFIRMED THAT SENIOR INDIAN OFFICIALS FROM SEVERAL MINISTRIES HAD MET SEVERAL DAYS AGO TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION REGARDING THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST.  KUMAR OPINED THAT FERNANDES WAS SELECTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT BY THIS GROUP; MEA DID NOT INTEND TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT ON THE MATTER.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, KUMAR AGREED THAT THE MISSILE ISSUE WAS RIPE FOR DISCUSSION IN AN INDO-PAKISTANI DIALOGUE, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF SECURITY ISSUES AS THE TWO SIDES REMAINED DEAD-LOCKED OVER THE PROCEDURAL LOGJAM OF ADDRESSING KASHMIR.  COMMENT ------- 5. (C)  IN RESPONDING TO THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST, WE SUSPECT THE INDIANS WILL ALLOW ACTIONS TO SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, WITH AN AGNI MISSILE TEST IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IT IS WORTH RECALLING COMMITMENTS BY PREVIOUS INDIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT THE AGNI PROGRAM REMAINED A HIGH PRIORITY, AND THAT THE INDIANS HAVE BEEN MULLING OVER A DECISION TO TEST THE AGNI FOR SOME TIME NOW. INDEED, JASJIT SINGH TOLD US THAT HE MADE ONE MORE RUN AT PUSHING FOR AN AGNI TEST DURING GUJRAL\'S FINAL WEEKS IN OFFICE.  THIS BJP-LED GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DEFENSE A PROMINENT ISSUE IN ITS AGENDA AND SEVERAL OF ITS \"SECURITY EXPERTS\" HAVE CALLED FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF LONGER RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES TO ADDRESS THE PERCEIVED CHINA THREAT.  THE DEFENSE MINISTER\'S COMMENTS THAT INDIA CAN TARGET ALL OF PAKISTAN WITH PRITHVI MISSILES CERTAINLY BOLSTERS ISLAMABAD\'S BELIEF THAT IT NEEDS LONGER RANGE MISSILES TO KEEP UP WITH ITS SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBOR.  THE UPCOMING VISITS OF SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS WILL PRESENT A USEFUL OPPORTUNITY TO URGE RESTRAINT WITH BOTH SIDES, ALTHOUGH NEW DELHI ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO PORTRAY ITS MISSILE PROGRAMS AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CHINA THREAT.
