C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 000648  DEPT FOR SA/PAB, S/CT, DS/ITA  E.O. 12958:  DECL:  2/06/11 TAGS:  PTER, EAIR, PLO, PK SUBJECT:  UPDATE:  PAN AM HIJACKERS  REFS:  2000 ISLAMABAD 6055 (B)  2000 ISLAMABAD 1120   (U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHELE J. SISON, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  ALL FIVE PAN AM 73 HIJACKERS REMAIN INCARCERATED AT ADIALA PRISON, RAWALPINDI. A JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING CONSIDERED THE CASE OF HIJACKER SULIEMAN AL-TURKI ONLY.  ACTION ON AL- TURKI'S DEPORTATION REMAINS PENDING AS THE LIBYAN EMBASSY HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT AL-TURKI IS A LIBYAN CITIZEN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE FURTHER MOVEMENT ON THIS CASE UNTIL AL-TURKI'S ATTORNEY FILES ANOTHER PETITION WITH THE COURT. THE DEPORTATIONS IN QUESTION WOULD BE BACK TO THE DEFENDANTS' CLAIMED COUNTRY OF ORIGIN -- NOT, AT THIS POINT, TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND TRIAL.  2.  (C)  (SUMMARY, CONTINUED)  MEANWHILE, AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM FROM FBI'S WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE ARRIVED ON JANUARY 30 TO CONTINUING THE INTERVIEWING OF WITNESSES AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY PERSONNEL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL PAN AM 73 INVESTIGATION.  THE TEAM WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP ON PREVIOUS FBI REQUESTS FOR ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  3.   (C)  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1986, SIX ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) TERRORISTS HIJACKED PAN AM 73 IN KARACHI.  TWENTY-TWO PASSENGERS WERE KILLED AND 125 WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE HIJACKERS RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY, WHICH WAS THEN REDUCED TO LIFE, AND THEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS (NOW COMPLETED).  ONE OF THE HIJACKERS DIED WHILE IN CUSTODY; THE OTHER FIVE -- SOULIEMAN AL TURKI, MUSTAFA HASSAN SAEED BOMER, MANSOOR AL-RASHID, MUHAMMAD ABDUL KHALIL HUSAIN AL-RAHAYAL AND JAMAL SAEED ABDUL RAHIM AL-FAHID -- REMAIN INCARCERATED IN ADIALA PRISON IN RAWALPINDI.  4.  (C)  THE NATIONALITY OF SEVERAL OF THE HIJACKERS REMAINS IN QUESTION.  BOMER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A JORDANIAN NATIONAL, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT DEPORTATION DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERWAY WITH THE GOJ.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAS NOT YET ACCEPTED AL TURKI'S CLAIM THAT HE IS A LIBYAN.  AL TURKI'S JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING WAS THUS STYMIED; WE EXPECT AL TURKI'S LAWYER TO FILE ANOTHER PETITION FOR RELEASE/DEPORTATION (TIMING UNKNOWN).  THE REMAINING THREE HIJACKERS CLAIM TO BE PALESTINIAN, A CLAIM THAT THE PALESTINIAN EMBASSY HAS THUS FAR REPORTEDLY REJECTED.  5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS AWARE OF THE USG'S INTEREST IN THE FUTURE PROSECUTION OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS.  WE HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE WITH INTERIOR MINISTER HAIDER A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND HE HAS DIRECTED HIS MINISTRY TO ASSIST US WITH OUR REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND WITNESS ACCESS RELATED TO DEVELOPING THE CASE. IN ADDITION, AT THE EMBASSY'S REQUEST, INTERIOR MINISTRY DEPUTY SECRETARY (POLITICAL) HUSSAIN CHAUDRY BRIEFED US ON FEBRUARY 1 ON THE AL-TURKI DEPORTATION HEARING (ONE OF CHAUDRY'S OFFICER HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO ATTEND THE HEARING).  6.  (C)  THE JANUARY 31 HEARING HAD BEEN SPURRED BY A PETITION FILED BY AL TURKI'S ATTORNEY SEEKING IMMEDIATE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY (THE DEFENDANT HAS NOW SERVED TIME IN EXCESS OF 14 YEARS).  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN'S REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA TO ARRANGE FOR SOULIEMAN'S DEPORTATION.  THE GOP REPRESENTATIVE ALSO INFORMED THE JUDGE THAT CONSULAR ACCESS HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY TO MEET WITH THE DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAD NOT YET CONFIRMED AL TURKI'S CITIZENSHIP. ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS, THE JUDGE APPARENTLY DID NOT SPECIFY A TIMEFRAME IN HIS RULING, BUT INSTRUCTED THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN REPRESENTATIVE TO WORK TO EXPEDITE AL TURKI'S DEPORTATION.  7. (C) THE FBI HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PROCESS THE HIJACKERS FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS.  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN LOCATING AND ARRANGING INTERVIEWS OF A NUMBER OF THE GOP WITNESSES.  THE GOP HAS PROVIDED THE FBI WITH A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE CASE PROPERTY, THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT (FIR) PREPARED ON THE CASE, AND AN UNSIGNED COPY OF A JOINT STATEMENT BY THE HIJACKERS.  8. (C)  THE VISITING FBI WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE TEAM CONTINUES IN ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE (A) COMPLETE COPIES OF INTERROGATION REPORTS PREPARED BY THE PAKISTANI INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE (ISID) FOR EACH OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS; (B)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT; (C)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COURT RECORD; (D) INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS; (E)  A DUPLICATE VIDEOTAPE TAKEN OF THE CRIME SCENE; (F)  LEGAL COMMENTS MEMORANDUM DATED 9/6-9/87; AND (G) MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL ADVISOR JAMSHED HAMID.  9.  (C) THE VISITING SPECIAL AGENTS HAVE ARRANGED A MEETING WITH ADIALA PRISON AUTHORITIES THIS WEEK TO PURSUE THEIR INVESTIGATION.   MILAM
