THE WESTERN EMBASSY NOTES THAT THE IRANIAN PRESS CLAIMED THAT THE RIOTS BEGAN BECAUSE A FOOTBALL GAME WAS POSTPONED DUE TO BAD WEATHER MAKING THE TURF UNSUITABLE FOR PLAY. THE EMBASSY BELIEVES THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE REAL REASON.  A CROWD OF  FROM TWO TO FIVE THOUSAND THREW STONES AND CARRIED PICTURES OF THE SHAH'S SON.  THE PRESENCE OF THE PICTURES SUGGESTS A PRE-ARRANGED, NOT SPONTANEOUS, DEMONSTRATION, AND FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT CANCELATION OF THE FOOTBALL GAME WAS NOT BECAUSE OF A WET PITCH.  FURTHER, SLOGANS WERE SHOUTED AGAINST THE REGIME AND SOME SHOTS WERE HEARD.   4.  THE EMBASSY IN TEHRAN NOTES THAT THE CLAIMS OF THE MUJAHIDIN FROM BAGHDAD WERE MUCH EXAGGERATED (COMMENT: AS USUAL), BUT CLEARLY ANY DEMONSTRATION MUST WORRY THE IRANIAN REGIME.  RUMORS ARE BEGINNING TO FLOOD TEHRAN, WITH COMPARISONS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TROUBLES IN 1979 RAMPANT.   MORE MILITARY ACTIVITY THAN USUAL HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE CITY.  GLASPIE " }

CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  2.  SUMMARY:  EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK'S INITIATIVE CALLING FOR A MIDDLE EAST FREE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CAME TOO LATE FOR INCLUSION IN BAGHDAD NEWSPAPERS APRIL 9.  WHAT IS IN THE PRESS--AGAIN, TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT--IS THE JOINT MUBARAK-SADDAM HUSAYN PRESS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE END OF MUBARAK'S BRIEF APRIL 7 VISIT TO IRAQ (REFTEL).  DURING THAT CONFERENCE, SADDAM REPEATED OLD ARGUMENTS IN HIS ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY AND DEFEND HIS RECENT STATEMENTS, BUT DID NOT RETRACT THEM, AND BLAMED THE U.S. FOR THE CLOUDS DARKENING U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS.  HIS ONE NEW IDEA: ARABS SHOULD UNDERTAKE COMMON SECURITY GUARANTEES.  END SUMMARY.  ON CW - STILL UNREPENTANT -------------------------  3.  SADDAM CONTINUES TO REVEAL THAT HE CANNOT AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HIS APRIL 1 REMARKS ON CW CREATED SUCH A FUROR.  GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETRACT OR MODIFY THEM, HE INSTEAD INSISTED, \"THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN WHAT WE SAID.\" FOLLOWING HIS OLD ARGUMENTS, HE TRIED TO EXCUSE IRAQ'S CW CAPABILITY BY TYING IT TO ISRAEL'S NUCLEAR BOMB, COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ASSUME IRAQ WILL USE ITS CW (AND CONDEMN IRAQ FOR THAT), WHILE ASSUMING ISRAEL WILL NOT/NOT USE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  THE WESTERN MEDIA ARE CONCENTRATING ON IRAQ'S CW AND IGNORE ISRAEL'S CW, BW AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  (THIS ARGUMENT WAS FURTHER DEVELOPED BY MFA UNDER SECRETARY HAMDUN TO THE AMBASSADOR APRIL 8--BAGHDAD 2084.)  U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS: DARK CLOUDS ---------------------------------  4.  MUBARAK WAS CAREFUL NOT/NOT TO CRITICIZE THE U.S., AND SO WAS SADDAM.  ON THE PRESENT POOR STATE OF RELATIONS, SADDAM LIMITED HIMSELF TO: \"WE SEE CLOUDS DARKENING IRAQI-U.S. RELATIONS WHENEVER THE ZIONIST LOBBY INTERVENES IN AMERICAN POLICY AND WHENEVER AMERICAN POLICY ERRS IN ASSESSING THE SITUATION.\"  HE EMPHASIZED IRAQ WANTS NOT JUST GOOD, BUT FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ALL STATES.  BUT IRAQ WANTS PEACE --------------------  5.  BOTH PRESIDENTS WERE AT PAINS TO STRESS THAT IRAQ WANTS PEACE.  TRYING TO GET HIS BASIC MESSAGE ACROSS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE SADDAM EMPHASIZED THAT IRAQ AND THE ARAB NATION WANT PEACE.  HE CITED AS AN EXAMPLE IRAQ'S EFFORTS TO MAKE PEACE WITH IRAN EVEN BEFORE THE WAR ENDED. BUT, HE WARNED, \"WE WILL NOT CONCEDE RIGHTS THAT RIGHTLY BELONG TO US IN OUR DISPUTE WITH IRAN.\" MUBARAK ECHOED SADDAM'S GENERAL SENTIMENTS. ACKNOWLEDGING IRAQ HAS FACED A HOSTILE CAMPAIGN (A SOP TO HIS HOST), AND CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO DEFUSE THE TENSIONS CREATED BY SADDAM'S APRIL 1 SPEECH (CAIRO 7329), MUBARAK AVERRED THAT \"IRAQ IS NOT A COUNTRY THAT WANTS WAR OR ADVOCATES WAR.  IT IS INDEED A COUNTRY THAT WANTS PEACE.\"  6.  CLEARLY CUT BY WESTERN MEDIA REMARKS, SADDAM REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED THAT IRAQ IS NOT \"WARMONGERING.\" \"IRAQ HAS COMMITTED AGGRESSION AGAINST NO ONE,\" HE SAID.  ALL IT DID WAS EXECUTE A SPY AND TRY TO BUY \"SIMPLE ITEMS.\"  SADDAM ARGUED THAT THE REAL \"AGGRESSION\" IS DENYING IRAQ ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND TRYING TO ENTRAP IT.  IRAQ HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST AGGRESSION.   UNITED WE STAND ---------------  7.  BOTH PRESIDENTS TOOK UP SADDAM'S THEME THAT A UNITED ARAB POSITION WOULD STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL ARAB COUNTRIES.  MUBARAK CALLED FOR \"GENERAL COORDINATION\" TO GUARANTEE ARAB NATIONAL SECURITY. SADDAM WENT FURTHER, ADVOCATING \"COMMON GUARDS\"-- ARMY, POLICY AND BORDER GUARDS--AT OUR GATES AND OPEN GATES WITHIN THE ARAB NATION.  IF REAL SECURITY COOPERATION EXISTED, IRAQ COULD DISBAND 30 (OF 50) DIVISIONS AND USE THE MONEY SAVED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF IRAQIS.  IF ARABS MEANT WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT UNIRY IN 1980, IRAN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ATTACK IRAQ, SADDAM SAID TESTILY.  PROHIBITIONS ON ARABS MUST END ------------------------------  8.  AS IN HIS EARLIER SPEECHES, SADDAM COMPLAINED . THAT ARABS ARE TREATED AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. (COMMENT:  PERHPAS STEMMING FROM HIS LIFELONG EFFORT TO PROMOTE A SENSE OF IDENTITY FOR \"IRAQIS\"--A SENSE HE OFTEN RECALLS HE LACKED AS A CHILD--SADDAM IS DWELLING MORE AND MORE ON THE THEME THAT ARABS ARE SEEN FROM ABROAD AS SECOND-CLASS HUMAN BEINGS; E.G., THE ISRAELIS CAN BE TRUSTED WITH CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, WHILE THE ARABS CANNOT.)  COMMENT -------  9.  WITH MUBARAK AT HIS SIDE AND FOLLOWING SEVERAL HOURS OF CONVERSATION, SADDAM APPEARED SOMEWHAT SUBDUED AND DEFENSIVE, CERTAINLY LESS ASSERTIVE THAN DURING HIS APRIL TALK WITH HIS OWN MOD STAFF.  10. WE HOPE EMBASSY CAIRO WILL BE ABLE TO ELICIT WHETHER THE EGYPTIANS THINK THEY MADE SOME PROGRESS IN DEFUSING TENSIONS WHILE THEY WERE IN BAGHDAD. THE TASK WILL BE DIFFICULT.  SADDAM IS NOT/NOT POSTURING.  HE IS GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT ISRAEL AND IRAN (WITNESS MOHTASHAMI-FUR'S CONTEMPT FOR ANY DIPLOMACY AND HIS CALL FOR JIHAD AGAINST IRAQ-- FBIS NC0704195090).  11.  THOSE CONCERNS NOTWITHSTANDING, SADDAM SEES HIMSELF PLAYING A BROADENING LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE ARAB WORLD.  HISTORICALLY, THE IRAQIS DO NOT TAKE KINDLY TO BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY THEIR CENTURIES-OLD RIVALS.  IF MUBARAK TRULY WANTS TO DRAW SADDAM INTO HIS REGIONAL INITIATIVE, HIS DIPLOMATIC TASK WILL BE A DELICATE AND CHALLENGING ONE.   GLASPIE " }

FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS, THE HEADLINE NEWS HAS BEEN SADDAM'S MEETINGS WITH A \"GROUP\" WHICH IS MAKING THE FINAL CHANGES IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION PRIOR TO DISCUSSION BY THE RCC AND THE PARTY'S REGIONAL COMMAND.  3.  WE THINK DEPARTMENT'S BIOGRAPHIC FILES SHOULD REFLECT THE NAMES OF THE SIX-MEMBER GROUP WHO SADDAM HAS SPENT SO MANY HOURS WITH ON THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT AND WHOSE VIEWS, THEREFORE, WE ASSUME HE VALUES.  ALL SIX, WEARING THEIR PARTY UNIFORMS, ARE PICTURED IN THE MEDIA SITTING IN WHAT IS OFTEN USED AS THE CABINET ROOM. THEY ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS SA'DUN HAMMADI AND TARIQ AZIZ, FLANKING THE PRESIDENT, PRESUMABLY REFLECTING THEIR SENIOR STATUS.  NEXT TO TARIQ AZIZ IS SPEAKER SALIH (WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE BAGHDAD BRANCH OF THE PARTY); AND THEN AHMAD HUSAYN AL-SAMARA'I.  THE LATTER CARRIES THE RANK OF A CABINET MINISTER HAVING BEEN MINISTER OF YOUTH; HE.IS NOW SYG OF THE PRESIDENT'S DIWAN AND, WE ARE TOLD, HIS \"FRIEND.\"  FLANKING SA'DUN IS MINISTER OF INFORMATION JASIM AND, FINALLY, HAMID YUSUF HUMMADI.  4.  HUMMADI, WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR FIRST HAD A SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE WHEN SHE WAS TRAPPED WITH HIM IN AN ELEVATOR DURING THE DOLE VISIT LAST MONTH, IS A TIKRITI AND A GRADUATE OF BAGHDAD UNIVERSITY IN ENGLISH.  DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE HIS BASIC BIO, WHICH SHOWS HIS APPOINTMENT IN EARLY 1979 AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S DIWAN, THEN LATER THAT YEAR AS THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL SECRETARY.  HIS ENGLISH IS EXCELLENT, AND WE ARE TOLD HE STUDIED WITH TARIQ AZIZ, WHO IS HIS GOOD FRIEND.  HIS POWER IS CONSIDERABLE; E.G., A CALL FROM HIM STOPPED THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR IN HIS TRACKS AFTER HE HAD ORDERED THE REMOVAL OF THE CHECKPOINT IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY LAST MONTH, AND WE WERE IN RECEIPT OF PROFUSE APOLOGIES FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT.

THE IRAQI MEDIA JUNE 7 HAS NOT REACTED TO RAFSANJANI'S JUNE 6 INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE COMMENTS INTER ALIA ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A MEETING WITH SADDAM (TEHRAN RADIO VERSION IN REF B).  IN SUMMARY, RAFSANJANI SAID THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MEETING WILL DEPEND ON NEGOTIATIONS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL AND \"UNDER THE SUPERVISION\" OF THE SYG (TEHRAN RADIO) OR \"IN CONSULTATION WITH\" THE SECRETARY GENERAL (IRANIAN NEWS SERVICE).  3.  RAFSANJANI(AND OTHER SENIOR IRANIANS EARLIER) ALSO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE BAGHDAD SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE REMARKS ON IRAN.  THE IRAQI MFA HAS TOLD US THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS ADVERSE IRANIAN REACTION, SINCE THE COMMUNIQUE SIMPLY REITERATED THE LANGUAGE OF THE CASABLANCA COMMUNIQUE, ADDING ONLY REFERENCE TO SADDAM'S RECENT \"MESSAGE OF PEACE\" TO IRAN.  4.  ON JUNE 6, THE PALESTINIAN \"AMBASSADOR\" TO IRAQ (FATAH) CONFIDED TO THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR THAT THE FIRST SADDAM LETTER HAD BEEN CARRIED BY AN ARAFAT EMISSARY TO TEHRAN.  RAFSANJANI'S RESPONSE HAD BEEN HANDED BY THE IRANIAN OIL MINISTER TO HIS IRAQI COUNTERPART AT AN OPEC MEETING.  THE SECOND SADDAM LETTER, HE ASSERTED, HAD ALSO MOVED DIRECTLY FROM AN IRAQI TO AN IRANIAN.  5.  WITHOUT MAKING CLEAR WHETHER HE HAD SEEN THE LETTER HIMSELF, THE PALESTINIAN SAID THAT SADDAM'S FIRST MESSAGE HAD INVITED IRAN TO LOOK TOWARD REESTABLISHING RELATIONS THROUGH DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS AT THE SUMMIT, WITH AN OPEN AGENDA, AND HAD NOTED THAT LIKE IRAN, IRAQ IS THREATENED BY ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES.  6.  FINALLY, THE PALESTINIAN CLAIMED THAT AN ARAFAT ENVOY IS EVEN NOW CARRYING A PLO LETTER TO RAFSANJANI, BUT THAT ARAFAT WOULD HIMSELF GO TO TEHRAN ONLY IF TANGIBLE RESULTS OF MEDIATION WERE IMMINENT; E.G., ON A POW EXCHANGE OR TO FIX A DATE FOR IRAN-IRAQ TALKS.  7.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE NOTED PRESS REPORTS THAT ARAFAT IS NOT/NOT WELCOME IN TEHRAN NOR IS HIS MEDIATION.  WE ALSO NOTE SPECULATION THAT THE OMANIS HAVE BEEN CARRYING THE MESSAGES.  WE CANNOT EVALUATE THE PALESTINIAN'S COMMENTS, ALTHOUGH WHY HE WOULD FABRICATE ALL THIS TO IMPRESS THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR IS DIFFICULT TO FATHOM.   GLASPIE " }

(U)  A NUMBER OF RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING IN THE REGION ABOUT RECENT ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPTS. THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE RUMORS ARE NOT FRIENDS OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE:  --AL TAYYAR AL-JADID (IRAQI SHI'A OPPOSITION PAMPHLET IN LONDON): ARRESTS IN MAY OF \"HUNDREDS\" OF ARMY OFFICERS AND CIVILIANS, INCLUDING SADDAM'S ADVISOR AND RELATIVE, FADIL BARRAK (FORMER HEAD OF IRAQI CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE);  --TEHRAN DOMESTIC SERVICE: 17 PILOTS EXECUTED IN EARLY APRIL;  --TURCOMAN (TURKISH PUBLICATION, PRESUMABLY BY TURKOMANS):  ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS, INCLUDING OF A GENERAL OFFICER NAMED DHIA AL-KAN'AN (THERE IS A TURCOMAN FAMILY OF THAT NAME IN KIRKUK).  2.  (C)  DESPITE THE OBVIOUSLY SUSPECT PROVENANCE OF THESE ASSERTIONS, WISHFUL THINKING BY ANTI-SADDAM GROUPS GIVE SUCH STORIES MORE CURRENCY THAN THEY DESERVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, EMBASSY KUWAIT REPORTS THAT THE INTELLIGENT AND SENSIBLE KUWAITI MINISTER OF OIL HAS TOLD TWO RECENT AMERICAN VISITORS THAT SADDAM'S NEW, TOUGH PUBLIC POSTURING ON FOREIGN POLICY MAY BE A REACTION TO \"INTERNAL PRESSURES AND INSTABILITY OF HIS REGIME.\"  IN THIS, SHAYKH ALI, WE BELIEVE, IS ENTIRELY WRONG.  THE KUWAITI AMBASSADOR HERE SHARES OUR ASSESSMENT THAT SADDAM IS DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, BUT THESE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY SPECIAL OR NEW CONCERN ABOUT COUP PLOTTING.  3.  (C)  WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE NOT OCCASIONAL \"DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS\" HERE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENT'S LONG-TIME KURDISH ADC, SABAH MIRZA, UNDOUBTEDLY BLOTTED HIS COPY BOOK THIS YEAR.  HE WAS ARRESTED AND MAY BE DEAD.  NOR ARE WE SUGGESTING THAT AN ABORTIVE COUP WOULD NECESSARILY BE DETECTED BY WESTERN EMBASSIES HERE.  WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF A GROUND SWELL OF ACTIVE ANTI-SADDAM SENTIMENT OR ACTIVITY.  4.  (C)  FURTHER, SADDAM IS WORKING HARD TO DO WHAT HE CAN TO RELIEVE HIS NEED TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON HIS VERY EFFECTIVE SECRET SERVICES. CURRENT EXAMPLES ARE HIS HIGHLY PUBLICIZED AND PERSONAL WORK ON REVIEW OF THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION AND HIS TIRELESS WALKABOUTS IN OBSCURE VILLAGES AND MAJOR TOWNS TO INSPECT AND IMPROVE CITIZENS' WELFARE. THE PARTY HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT THOUSANDS OF CHEERING ARAB (NOT KURDISH) IRAQIS TO GREET THEIR PRESIDENT.  5.  (S)  FINALLY, WE INVITE ATTENTION TO UNEVALUATED INTELLIGENCE ON THESE ISSUES. A GOODS-OR BAD-- EXAMPLE IS IIR 2 762 0096 90 (CDRUSAOPSGP), WHICH HAS BARRAK  ARRESTED AND DEAD IN 1989, A PERIOD WHEN HIS PICTURE APPEARED IN THE PRESS WITH SADDAM AND MORE THAN ONE AMERICAN HAD LUNCH WITH HIM.

ALL FOUR ARABIC LANGUAGE DAILIES FEATURE ONE RPT ONE 'ID MESSAGE TO SADDAM, AND THAT MESSAGE IN ALL DAILIES IS BOXED IN A FEATURED POSITION UNDER A HEADLINE: \"THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES 'ID GREETINGS FROM THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\"  THE ENTIRE TEXT OF PRESIDENT BUSHES MESSAGE, INCLUDING THE SIGNATURE AND SALUTATION LINES, ARE PRINTED.  3.  WE HAD RECEIVED THE PRESIDENT'S GREETINGS BY CABLE AT MID-DAY JULY 1, AND THE MFA PROTOCOL OFFICE KEPT ONE OFFICER PRESENT TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE (EVERY ONE WAS DEPARTING EARLY TO BEGIN 'ID CELEBRATIONS) UNTIL WE COULD GET THERE. OBVIOUSLY THE MFA RUSHED THE TEXT OVER TO THE PRESIDENCY AND TOP LEVEL MFA OFFICIALS MADE A POINT OF INFORMING THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE TEXT OF THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN FEATURED ON THE JULY 1 NATIONAL TV NEWS.  4.  THE IRAQIS IN THE LAST FEW PAYS, HOWEVER, HAVE ALSO SIGNALED, IN PREDICTABLE TERMS, THAT THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE PERCEIVED AS PASSIVELY SUBMITTING TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AND PARTY LEADERSHIP REGARD AS AN ANTI-IRAQI \"CAMPAIGN\" BY WHAT THEY CALL \"CERTAIN ELEMENTS\" IN THE USG.  THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE FORTHRIGHT STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF TRADE (RESPONSIBLE FOR CCC AFFAIRS) TO CONGRESSMAN NIELSON JULY 1, THAT AS A RESULT OF SUSPENSION OF CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES (FOR REASONS THE GOI BELIEVES REFLECT UNJUSTIFIED HOSTILITY TOWARD IRAQ), THE GOI WILL BUY NO APT NO AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. (THAT SAME EVENING, THE WHOLE DIPLOMATIC CORPS GOT THE MESSAGE WHEN THE IRAQI MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WAS DESPATCHED AS THE PRESIDENT'S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CANADIAN NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION.)  5.  THIS IRAQI DECISION IS NOT RPT NOT REGARDED LOCALLY AS \"SANCTIONS\" AGAINST AMERICAN PRODUCTS. SADDAM EXPLAINED TO ABC TV LAST WEEK THAT IRAQ WOULD NOT INITIATE ECONOMIC WARFARE OF THIS KIND.  RATHER, THE IRAQIS SEE THEIR DECISION AS A RETALIATION TO A SANCTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM. SUCH A DECISION BY BAGHDAD WAS PREDICTABLE; THAT THE IRAQIS POSTPONED RETALIATION FOR SO LONG, AND EVEN RECEIVED AN AMERICAN INVESTIGATING TEAM FROM USDA, IS THE ONLY CURIOUS PART OF THE AFFAIR.  THAT THE DECISION IS SO LONG IN COMING, AND THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN PROMULGATED, ARE FURTHER SIGNALS THAT IRAQ HOPES FOR BETTER BILATERAL RELATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD.  6.  NOTE:  FOR THE RECORD, ON THE MORNING OF JULY 2 DEPUTY FONMIN HAMDUN INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT, ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENCY, AFP WAS RUNNING A STORY ON ITS WIRE THAT A PRESS SPOKESMAN WITH PRESIDENT BUSH HAD DENIED THAT 'ID GREETINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO IRAQ.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER SAID HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO GO TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY (TOTALLY EMPTY ON THIS MUSLIM \"CHRISTMAS DAY\") AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE ISSUE WAS SORTED OUT.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER EMPHASIZED THAT A DECISION HAVING BEEN TAKEN (BY SADDAM) TO REACH OUT TO US (BY GIVING PRESIDENT BUSH'S GREETINGS TOP BILLING OVER ALL MUSLIN AND NON-MUSLIM CHIEFS OF STATE), THERE WAS CONSTERNATION AT THE IRAQI PRESIDENCY.  7.  SUBSEQUENTLY, WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT THE AFP STORY HAD BEEN AN AFP MISTAKE (POPE/GLASPIE TELECON 7/2/90).  GLASPIE " }

IT HAS PUBLISHED BOTH THE THREE- HOUR \"UNCUT\" VERSION AND WHAT IT CLAIMS IS THE TEXT OF THE 20-MINUTE ABC PROGRAM. ONCE AGAIN, SADDAM HAS FOUND \"EVIDENCE\" OF A U.S. CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM, YET HE IS SOLDIERING ON IN HIS NEW POLICY OF AVAILABILITY TO THE WESTERN PRESS (LE  FIGARO IS NEXT) AND IN HIS WILLING- NESS TO LET THE IRAQI PUBLIC SEE AND HEAR HIM UNCUT,WARTS AND ALL.  END SUMMARY.  3.  FOLLOWING THE MEDIA HEADLINES GIVEN TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S 'ID AL-ADHA MESSAGE TO IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN (REF A) AND SADDAM'S CORDIAL REPLY (HIGHLIGHTED IN JULY 6 NEWSPAPERS), IRAQ'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED ARABIC PRESS LET OUT A HOWL OF FRUSTRATION JULY 7 AT ABC AND DIANE SAWYER FOR AIRING ONLY A SMALL \"DISTORTED\" PORTION OF SADDAM'S JUNE 24 THREE-HOUR PLUS INTERVIEW WITH SAWYER.  \"DELIBERATE DISTORTION IN CONVERSATION OF THE LEADER WITH AMERICAN TV NETWORK:  THIS IS THE SPURIOUS DEMOCRACY OF THE AMERICANS.\"  THE ARTICLE ACCOMPANYING THE HEAD- LINES DEVELOPS THESE THEMES AND INVITES READERS TO COMPARE WHAT ABC AIRED (TEXT PRINTED JULY 7) WITH TEXT OF THE FULL INTERVIEW  (PUBLISHED JUNE 30), TO SEE JUST HOW DISTORTED U.S. REPORT- ING ON IRAQ IS.  4.  U/S HAMDUN MADE THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT \"DISTORTION\" TO US PRIVATELY, THOUGH IN MORE TEMPERATE TERMS, ON JUNE 30.  WHEN WE POINTED OUT THAT COMPRESSING 3 HOURS INTO 20 MINUTES WOULD UNAVOIDABLY REMOVE SOME OF THE CONTEXT OF SPECIFIC REMARKS, HAMDUN SAID HE MEANT THERE WAS DELIBERATE AND NEGATIVE DISTORTION (HE HAD SEEN THE ABC VERSION).  5.  COMMENT:  CLEARLY, THE ABC INCIDENT HAS FUELLED SADDAM'S BELIEF THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA ARE ENGAGED IN AN ANTI-IRAQ CAMPAIGN--EDITORIALS ARE ALREADY MAKING THAT POINT--AND ADD TO THE SENSE THAT IRAQ WILL NOT GET A \"FAIR\" HEARING IN THE WEST.  NEVERTHELESS, SADDAM IS NOT THROWING IN THE TOWEL; HE IS EXPECTED TO GRANT AN INTERVIEW TO  LE FIGARO THIS WEEK, AND 40 MORE EUROPEAN (AND ONE JAPANESE) JOURNALISTS HAVE SENT IN THEIR REQUESTS.  6.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE THE IRAQIS REACTED TO THE \"DISTORTION\" BY RUNNING SIX HOURS OF SADDAM'S INTERVIEWS BUT HAVE PRINTED WHAT WAS AIRED BY ABC, INCLUDING MATERIAL THAT WAS EXCISED FROM THE VERSION OF THE INTER- VIEW AS BROADCAST HERE.  THE JULY 7 ARABIC PRESS TRANSCRIPTS OF THAT INTERVIEW CONTAIN, FOR EXAMPLE, SADDAM'S DENIAL THAT HE EVER KILLED ANYONE AND HIS EXCHANGE WITH SAWYER ABOUT PUNISH- MENT FOR THOSE WHO INSULT THE PRESIDENT.  BUT, AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT SADDAM HUSAYN IS FEELING COMFORT- ABLE AND CONFIDENT:  HE PERMITTED ALL IRAQIS TO READ AND SEE HIS INTERVIEWS, DEMONSTRATING THAT HE DOES NOT MIND APPEARING BEFORE THEM AS LESS THAN IMPECCABLE.  7.  ACTION REQUESTED.  WE ARE MOST KEEN TO SEE A VIDEO OF SAWYER'S INTERVIEW WITH SADDAM, IN ORDER TO COMPARE IT WITH THE TWO VERSIONS PUBLISHED HERE.  GLASPIE " }

IRAQ SUFFERED 100,000'S OF CASUALTIES AND IS NOW SO POOR THAT WAR ORPHAN PENSIONS WILL SOON BE CUT; YET RICH KUWAIT WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT OPEC DISCIPLINE. IRAQ IS SICK OF WAR, BUT KUWAIT HAS IGNORED DIPLOMACY. USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE WILL ENCOURAGE THE UAE AND KUWAIT TO IGNORE CONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY. IF IRAQ IS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED BY THE USG, IT WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO \"RESPOND,\" HOWEVER ILLOGICAL AND SELF DESTRUCTIVE THAT WOULD PROVE.  --ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT, SADDAM'S MESSAGE TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK'S DIPLOMACY, BUT WE MUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE \"SELFISHNESS\" IS UNBEARABLE. AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN PEACEFUL MEANS. END SUMMARY.  3. AMBASSADOR WAS SUMMONED BY PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN AT NOON JULY 25. ALSO PRESENT WERE FONMIN AZIZ, THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE DIRECTOR, TWO NOTETAKERS, AND THE IRAQI INTERPRETER.  4. SADDAM, WHOSE MANNER WAS CORDIAL, REASONABLE AND EVEN WARM THROUGHOUT THE ENSUING TWO HOURS, SAID HE WISHED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BUSH. SADDAM THEN RECALLED IN DETAIL THE HISTORY OF IRAQ'S DECISION TO REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND ITS POSTPONING IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DECISION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT WEAK AND NEEDY. HE THEN SPOKE ABOUT THE MANY \"BLOWS\" OUR RELATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SINCE 1984, CHIEF AMONG THEM IRANGATE. IT WAS AFTER THE FAW VICTORY, SADDAM SAID, THAT IRAQI MISAPPREHENSIONS ABOUT USG PURPOSES BEGAN TO SURFACE AGAIN, I.E., SUSPICIONS THAT THE U.S. WAS NOT HAPPY TO SEE THE WAR END.  5. PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE, SADDAM SAID THAT THERE ARE \"SOME CIRCLES\" IN THE USG, INCLUDING IN CIA AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT, BUT EMPHATICALLY EXCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY BAKER, WHO ARE NOT FRIENDLY TOWARD IRAQ-U.S. RELATIONS. HE THEN LISTED WHAT HE SEEMED TO REGARD AS FACTS TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION: \"SOME CIRCLES ARE GATHERING INFORMATION ON WHO MIGHT BE SADDAM HUSAYN'S SUCCESSOR;\" THEY KEPT UP CONTACTS IN THE GULF WARNING AGAINST IRAQ; THEY WORKED TO ENSURE NO HELP WOULD GO TO IRAQ (READ EXIM AND CCC).  6. IRAQ, THE PRESIDENT STRESSED, IS IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WITH 40 BILLION USD DEBTS. IRAQ, WHOSE VICTORY IN THE WAR AGAINST IRAN MADE AN HISTORIC DIFFERENCE TO THE ARAB WORLD AND THE WEST, NEEDS A MARSHALL PLAN. BUT \"YOU WANT THE OIL PRICE DOWN,\" SADDAM CHARGED.  7. RESUMING HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES WHICH HE BELIEVED WERE ALL INSPIRED BY \"SOME CIRCLES\" IN THE USG, HE RECALLED THE \"USIA CAMPAIGN\" AGAINST HIMSELF, AND THE GENERAL MEDIA ASSAULT ON IRAQ AND ITS PRESIDENT.  8. DESPITE ALL THESE BLOWS, SADDAM SAID, AND ALTHOUGH \"WE WERE SOMEWHAT ANNOYED,\" WE STILL HOPED THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. BUT THOSE WHO FORCE OIL PRICES DOWN ARE ENGAGING IN ECONOMIC WARFARE AND IRAQ CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH A TRESPASS ON ITS DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY.  9. THE SPEARHEADS (FOR THE USG) HAVE BEEN KUWAIT AND THE UAE, SADDAM SAID. SADDAM SAID CAREFULLY THAT JUST AS IRAQ WILL NOT THREATEN OTHERS, IT WILL ACCEPT NO THREAT AGAINST ITSELF. \"WE HOPE THE USG WILL NOT MISUNDERSTAND:\" IRAQ ACCEPTS, AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID, THAT ANY COUNTRY MAY CHOOSE ITS FRIENDS. BUT THE USG KNOWS THAT IT WAS IRAQ, NOT THE USG, WHICH DECISIVELY PROTECTED THOSE USG FRIENDS DURING THE WAR--AND THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE USG, TO SAY NOTHING OF GEOGRAPHY, WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT 10,000 DEAD IN A SINGLE BATTLE, AS IRAQ DID.  10. SADDAM ASKED WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE USG TO ANNOUNCE IT IS COMMITTED TO THE DEFENSE OF ITS FRIENDS, INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION, HE SAID THAT TO IRAQ IT MEANS FLAGRANT BIAS AGAINST THE GOI.  11. COMING TO ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS, SADDAM ARGUED THAT USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE AND KUWAIT (SIC) ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR UNGENEROUS POLICIES. THE IRAQI RIGHTS, SADDAM EMPHASIZED, WILL BE RESTORED ONE BY ONE, THOUGH IT MAY TAKE A MONTH OR MUCH MORE THAN A YEAR. IRAQ HOPES THE USG WILL BE IN HARMONY WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO THIS DISPUTE.  12. SADDAM SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE USG IS DETERMINED TO KEEP THE OIL FLOWING AND TO MAINTAIN ITS FRIENDSHIPS IN THE GULF. WHAT HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE DAMAGING IRAQ, WHICH IS WHAT OUR GULF MANEUVERS WILL DO.  13. SADDAM SAID HE FULLY BELIEVES THE USG WANTS PEACE, AND THAT IS GOOD. BUT DO NOT, HE ASKED, USE METHODS WHICH YOU SAY YOU DO NOT LIKE, METHODS LIKE ARM-TWISTING-  14. AT THIS POINT SADDAM SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT PRIDE OF IRAQIS, WHO BELIEVE IN \"LIBERTY OR DEATH.\" IRAQ WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IF THE U.S. USES THESE METHODS. IRAQ KNOWS THE USG CAN SEND PLANES AND ROCKETS AND HURT IRAQ DEEPLY. SADDAM ASKS THAT THE USG NOT FORCE IRAQ TO THE POINT OF HUMILIATION AT WHICH LOGIC MUST BE DISREGARDED. IRAQ DOES NOT CONSIDER THE U.S. AN ENEMY AND HAS TRIED TO BE FRIENDS.  15. AS FOR THE INTRA-ARAB DISPUTES, SADDAM SAID HE IS NOT ASKING THE USG TO TAKE UP ANY PARTICULAR ROLE SINCE THE SOLUTIONS MUST COME THROUGH ARAB AND BILATERAL DIPLOMACY.  16. RETURNING TO HIS THEME THAT IRAQ WANTS DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AS WELL AS FRIENDSHIP WITH THE U.S., HE CHARGED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR THERE WERE MANY OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WHICH MADE IT SEEM THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT WANT TO RECIPROCATE. HOW, FOR EXAMPLE, SADDAM ASKED,CAN WE INTERPRET THE INVITATION FOR ARENS TO VISIT AT A TIME OF CRISIS IN THE GULF? WHY DID THE U.S- DEFENSE MINISTER MAKE \"INFLAMMATORY\" STATEMENTS?  17. SADDAM SAID THAT THE IRAQIS KNOW WHAT WAR IS, WANT NO MORE OF IT--\"DO NOT PUSH US TO IT; DO NOT MAKE IT THE ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH WHICH WE CAN PROTECT OUR DIGNITY.\"  18. PRESIDENT BUSH, SADDAM SAID, HAS MADE NO MISTAKE IN HIS PRESIDENCY VIS-A-VIS THE ARABS. THE DECISION ON THE PLO DIALOGUE WAS \"MISTAKEN,\" BUT IT WAS TAKEN UNDER \"ZIONIST PRESSURE\" AND, SADDAM SAID, IS PERHAPS A CLEVER TACTIC TO ABSORB THAT PRESSURE.  19. AFTER A SHORT DIVERSION ON THE NEED FOR THE U.S. TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF 200,000 ARABS WITH THE SAME VIGOR AND INTEREST AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE ISRAELIS, SADDAM CONCLUDED BY RESTATING THAT IRAQ WANTS AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP \"ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT PANT FOR IT, WE WILL DO OUR PART AS FRIENDS.\"  20. SADDAM THEN OFFERED AN ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS POINT. HE HAD TOLD THE IRAQI KURDISH LEADER IN 1974 THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HALF OF THE SHATT AL-ARAB TO IRAN TO OBTAIN ALL OF A PROSPEROUS IRAQ. THE KURD HAD BET THAT SADDAM WOULD NOT GIVE HALF THE SHATT--THE KURD WAS WRONG. EVEN NOW, THE ONLY REAL ISSUE WITH IRAN IS THE SHATT, AND IF GIVING AWAY HALF OF THE WATERWAY IS THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND IRAQI PROSPERITY, SADDAM SAID HE WOULD BE GUIDED BY WHAT HE DID IN 1974.  21. THE AMBASSADOR THANKED SADDAM FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH HIM SOME OF HIS AND OUR CONCERNS. PRESIDENT BUSH, TOO, WANTS FRIENDSHIP, AS HE HAD WRITTEN AT THE 'ID AND ON THE OCCASION OF IRAQ'S NATIONAL DAY. SADDAM INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THOSE  22. AMBASSADOR RESUMED HER THEME, RECALLING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD INSTRUCTED HER TO BROADEN AND DEEPEN OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAQ. SADDAM HAD REFERRED TO \"SOME CIRCLES\" ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT AIM. SUCH CIRCLES CERTAINLY EXISTED, BUT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION IS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT CONTROL THE AMERICAN PRESS; IF HE DID, CRITICISM OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT EXIST. SADDAM AGAIN INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE UNDERSTOOD THAT. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD SEEN THE DIANE SAWYER SHOW AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CHEP AND UNFAIR. BUT THE AMERICAN PRESS TREATS ALL POLITICIANS WITHOUT KID GLOVES--THAT IS OUR WAY.  23. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS VERY RECENTLY REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE FOR A BETTER RELATIONSHIP AND HAS PROVEN THAT BY, FOR EXAMPLE, OPPOSING SANCTIONS BILLS. HERE SADDAM INTERRUPTED AGAIN. LAUGHING, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR IRAQ TO BUY IN THE U.S. EVERYTHING IS PROHIBITED EXCEPT FOR WHEAT, AND NO DOUBT THAT WILL SOON BE DECLARED A DUAL-USE ITEM- SADDAM SAID, HOWEVER, HE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE, BUT RATHER CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES AT HAND.  24. AMBASSADOR SAID THERE WERE MANY ISSUES HE HAD RAISED SHE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON, BUT SHE WISHED TO USE HER LIMITED TIME WITH THE PRESIDENT TO STRESS FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH'S DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP AND, SECOND, HIS STRONG DESIRE, SHARED WE ASSUME BY IRAQ, FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE MID EAST. IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO BE CONCERNED WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER BOTH SAY PUBLICLY THAT KUWAITI ACTIONS ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF MILITARY AGGRESSION, AND THEN WE LEARN THAT MANY UNITS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER? IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO ASK, IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP, NOT CONFRONTATION, THE SIMPLE QUESTION: WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS?  25. SADDAM SAID THAT WAS INDEED A REASONABLE QUESTION. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED FOR REGIONAL PEACE, IN FACT IT IS OUR DUTY AS A SUPERPOWER. \"BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM (KUWAIT AND UAE) UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY WE ARE SUFFERING.\" THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IS SUCH THAT THE PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS WILL HAVE TO BE CUT. AT THIS POINT, THE INTERPRETER AND ONE OF THE NOTETAKERS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT.  26. AFTER A PAUSE FOR RECUPERATION, SADDAM SAID, IN EFFECT, BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING: WE SENT ENVOYS, WROTE MESSAGES, ASKED FAHD TO ARRANGE QUADRAPARTITE SUMMIT (IRAQ, SAG, UE, KUWAIT). FAHD SUGGESTFD OIL MINISTERS INSTEAD AND WE AGREED TO THE JEDDAH AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL BELOW OUR HOPES. THEN, SADDAM CONTINUED, TWO DAYS LATER THE KUWAITI OIL MINISTER ANNOUNCED HE WOULD WANT TO ANNUL THAT AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO MONTHS. AS FOR THE UAE, SADDAM SAID, I BEGGED SHAYKH ZAYID TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS (WHEN SADDAM ENTERTAINED HIM IN MOSUL AFTER THE BAGHDAD SUMMIT), AND ZAYID SAID JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK TO ABU DHABI. BUT THEN HIS MINISTER OF OIL MADE \"BAD STATEMENTS.\"  27. AT THIS POINT, SADDAM LEFT THE ROOM TO TAKE AN URGENT CALL FROM MUBARAK. AFTER HIS RETURN, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF HE COULD TELL HER IF THERE HAS ANY PROGRESS IN FINDING A PEACEFUL WAY TO DEFUSE THE DISPUTE. THIS WAS SOMETHING PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD BE KEENLY INTERESTED TO KNOW. SADDAM SAID THAT HE HAD JUST LEARNED FROM MUBARAK THE KUWAITIS HAVE AGREED TO NEGOTIATE. THE KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE/PRIME MINISTER WOULD MEET IN RIYADH WITH SADDAM'S NUMBER TWO, IZZAT IBRAHIM, AND THEN THE KUWAITI WOULD COME TO BAGHDAD ON SATURDAY, SUNDAY OR, AT THE LATEST, MONDAY, JULY 30.  28. \"I TOLD MUBARAK,\" SADDAM SAID, THAT \"NOTHING WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE MEETING,\" AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN DURING OR AFTER THE MEETING IF THE KUWAITIS WILL AT LAST \"GIVE US SOME HOPE.\"  29. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS GOOD NEWS. SADDAM THEN ASKED HER TO CONVEY HIS WARM GREETINGS TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND TO CONVEY HIS MESSAGE TO HIM.  30. NOTE: ON THE BORDER QUESTION, SADDAM REFERRED TO THE 1961 AGREEMENT AND A \"LINE OF PATROL\" IT HAD ESTABLISHED. THE KUWAITIS, HE SAID, HAD TOLD MUBARAK IRAQ WAS 20 KILOMETERS \"IN FRONT\" OF THIS LINE. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SHE HAD SERVED IN KUWAIT 20 YEARS BEFORE; THEN, AS NOW, WE TOOK NO POSITION ON THESE ARAB AFFAIRS.  31. COMMENT: IN THE MEMORY QF THE CURRENT DIPLOMATIC CORPS, SADDAM HAS NEVER SUMMONED AN AMBASSADOR. HE IS WORRIED.  ACCORDING TO HIS OWN POLITICAL THEORIZING (U.S. THE SOLE MAJOR POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST), HE NEEDS AT A MINIMUM A CORRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH US FOR OBVIOUS GEOPOLITICAL REASONS, ESPECIALLY AS LONG AS HE PERCEIVES MORTAL THREATS FROM ISRAEL AND IRAN. AMBASSADOR BELIEVES SADDAM SUSPECTS OUR DECISION SUDDENLY TO UNDERTAKE MANEUVERS WITH ABU DHABI IS A HARBINGER OF A USG DECISION TO TAKE SIDES. FURTHER, SADDAM, HIMSELF BEGINNING TO HAVE AN INKLING OF HOW MUCH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE U.S., IS APPREHENSIVE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH INHIBIT HIM, SUCH AS:  --HE CANNOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE PERCEIVED AS CAVING IN TO SUPERPOWER BULLYING (AS U/S HAMDUN FRANKLY WARNED US IN LATE 1988);  --IRAQ, WHICH LOST 100,000'S OF CASUALTIES, IS SUFFERING AND KUWAIT IS \"MISERLY\" AND \"SELFISH.\"  32. IT WAS PROGRESS TO HAVE SADDAM ADMIT THAT THE USG HAS A \"RESPONSIBILITY\" IN THE REGION, AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT AN ANSWER WHEN WE ASK IRAQ'S INTENTIONS. HIS RESPONSE IN EFFECT THAT HE TRIED VARIOUS DIPLOMATIC/CHANNELS BEFORE RESORTING TO UNADULTERATED INTIMIDATION HAS AT LEAST THE VIRTUE OF FRANKNESS. HIS EMPHASIS THAT HE WANTS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IS SURELY SINCERE (IRAQIS ARE SICK OF WAR), BUT THE TERMS SOUND DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SADDAM SEEMS TO WANT PLEDGES NOW ON OIL PRICES AND PRODUCTION TO COVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS.   GLASPIE " }

THE INTERIM FREE GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED IRAQI GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND ASSISTANCE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER WITH A VIEW TO SPARING THE PEOPLE OF KUWAIT ANY HARM.

IT IS UP TO THE PEOPLE OF KUWAIT THEMSELVES TO DETERMINE IN THE END THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.
