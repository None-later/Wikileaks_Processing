I LOOK FORWARD TO DEVELOPING FRIENDLY AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS.  PLEASE ACCEPT, YOUR EXCELLENCY, MY SINCERE WISHES AND KIND REGARDS.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 000017   STATE FOR NEA/NGA  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2014 TAGS:  PTER, PGOV, PREL, PINS, MARR, IZ SUBJECT:  USEB 018: IRAQI GOVERNMENT SIGNALS TOUGHER SENTENCES FOR CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS  REF: BAGHDAD 00001  CLASSIFIED BY DCM JAMES JEFFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).      1.  (C) SUMMARY.  SENIOR IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT (IIG) OFFICIALS ARE MAKING CLEAR THAT THEY BELIEVE TOUGHER MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN TO DEFEAT VIOLENCE.  THEY HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT TRANSPARENT RULE OF LAW PROCEDURES WOULD STILL APPLY.  THE ISSUE MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED IN THE FIELD.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) SENIOR IRAQI OFFICIALS HAVE MADE A PARTICULAR POINT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AWARE THEY INTEND TO TAKE A TOUGH LINE AGAINST VIOLENCE.  THIS WAS A THEME IN AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTEQS PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS (REFTEL) AS WELL AS IN FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARIQS CONVERSATION JUNE 28 WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD.  3.  (C) FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARI GAVE MORE DETAIL IN A JUNE 28 DISCUSSION WITH POL/MIL COUNSELOR NEUMANN.  ZEBARI CHARACTERIZED THE THREAT AS BEING THREE FOLD; BAQATHISTS, TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS.  HE SAID THE THIRD CATEGORY IS PROVIDING A LARGE BASE OF LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO THE TERRORISTS.  UP TO NOW THE COALITION HAS SUSPENDED THE DEATH PENALTY BUT IRAQ IS NOW SOVEREIGN; LEAVING THE IMPLICATION IT WILL BE RE-IMPOSED.  HE CONTINUED THAT IRAQIS ARE USED TO SEEING JUSTICE MORE DIRECTLY THAN THEY HAVE UNDER THE COALITION.  HE NOTED THAT IN MANY ARAB COUNTRIES IT IS NORMAL TO SEE TELEVISED CONFESSIONS, BUT THE CPA HAD NOT ALLOWED THIS.  ZEBARI ASSURED NEUMANN THAT REASONABLE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS WOULD CONTINUE TO PREVAIL WITH TRIALS AND OBSERVANCE OF LAWS.  HOWEVER, HE LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TOUGHER MEASURES.  4.  (C) WE ARE HEARING SOME TALK OF THE PRIME MINISTER IMPOSING A STATE OF EMERGENCY.  HIS OFFICE SEEMS TO BE RESEARCHING THIS WITH LAWYERS TO INSURE THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH NORMALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL PRINCIPLES.  BEFORE THE END OF CPA, ALLAWI WAS BRIEFED BY CPA LEGAL ON WHAT HE COULD AND COULD NOT DO IN THIS REGARD IN VIEW OF THE TAL AND OPERATIVE IRAQI LAW.  THE BOTTOM LINE POINT MADE TO HIM WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW DUE PROCESS STRICTLY, HAVE VALID JUSTIFICATION, AND FOR MOST ACTIONS HAVE TO PASS A LAW Q- NOT EASY CONSIDERING THE CONDITIONS THE IIG MUST OPERATE UNDER.  5. (C) COMMENT.  THE IIG IS FIGHTING FOR ITS LIFE, LITERALLY IN THE CASE OF SECURITY FORCES AND OFFICIALS. THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE EXPLICITLY STATED THAT CHANGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ACCEPTED LEGAL NORMS.  WE HAVE NOT SIGNALED ANY DISAPPROVAL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POINTEDLY ASKED ABOUT LEGAL NORMS AND RECEIVED THE ASSURANCES NOTED ABOVE. THE IIG KNOWS THAT IT HAS TO CONSULT WITH US ON CONSTRUCTING A STATE OF EMERGENCY LAW SINCE ITS ENFORCEMENT COULD INVOLVE COALITION FORCES.  AN EMERGENCY LAW USED TO STIFLE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL.  AN EMERGENCY LAW THAT RESTORES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE ON SECURITY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FREE POLITICAL DEBATE AND COMPETITION WOULD BE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.  A SEPARATE PROBLEM MAY BE TO EXPLAIN TO IRAQI SECURITY FORCES THAT BEING SOVEREIGN DOESNQT MEAN THEY CAN BEAT PRISONERS.  U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE ALREADY INTERVENED TO STOP ONE SMALLISH INCIDENT BUT WE THINK OTHERS WILL BE LIKELY. ORDERS TO COALITION FORCES NOT TO ALLOW SUCH ACTIONS ARE CLEAR.  END COMMENT.

NEGROPONTE FOR 1.4 (B) AND (D).  SUMMARY -------  1. (C) IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JULY 4 THAT THE NEW INTERIM IRAQI GOVERNMENT (IIG) MUST DEMONSTRATE ITS INDEPENDENCE AND SHOW THE IRAQI PEOPLE THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER WAS GENUINE.  HE HOPED DISBURSEMENT OF U.S. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS WOULD BE ACCELERATED AND SAID THAT STABILITY AND SECURITY HAD IMPROVED IN AREAS WHERE SUPPLEMENTAL MONEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPENT.  ZEBARI WAS PLEASED WITH HIS TRIP TO THE NATO SUMMIT IN ISTANBUL AND WELCOMED THE FINAL OUTCOME.  HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND ITS NEIGHBORS WERE DIFFICULT, AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA AS PROBLEMATIC.  REGARDING ELECTIONS, ZEBARI ARGUED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD BE QTHE SAVIORQ FOR IRAQ WHILE A WINNER- TAKE-ALL SYSTEM WOULD SOW THE SEEDS FOR CIVIL WAR.  END SUMMARY.  TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY -----------------------  2.  (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE MET JULY 4 WITH FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARI AS AN INITIAL COURTESY CALL.  ZEBARI WAS POSITIVE ABOUT THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND JOKED WITH THE AMBASSADOR THAT IF HE BELIEVED ONLY THE MEDIAQS INTERPRETATION OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS, HE WOULD TRY TO QSEEK POLITICAL ASYLUMQ ABROAD.  THE MINISTER UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVING TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE THAT THE TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY WAS GENUINE AND CREDIBLE.  HE ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT IRAQ AND THE UNITED STATES WERE QON THE SAME TEAMQ BUT SAID THE IIG WOULD NEED TO SHOW ITS INDEPENDENCE.  3.  (C) SADDAM HUSSEINQS ARRAIGNMENT WAS A SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF LEADERSHIP BY THE IIG, ACCORDING TO ZEBARI.  HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH SOME COLLEAGUES HAD RESERVATIONS THAT SADDAM WOULD USE THE OCCASION TO HIS ADVANTAGE, ZEBARI WAS CONVINCED THE HEARING HUMILIATED SADDAM AND "SENT THE RIGHT MESSAGE" TO THE IRAQI PUBLIC.  4.  (C) REGARDING THE MEDIA, THE MINISTER SAID THE IIG WOULD NEED TO MANAGE "ITS MESSAGE" AND PUSH MORE OFFICIALS FORWARD TO SPEAK WITH THE PRESS.  ZEBARI SAID THAT IT WAS PREDOMINANTLY CPA OFFICIALS WHO INTERFACED WITH THE MEDIA FOR THE PAST YEAR.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED WITH ZEBARI AND NOTED THAT HE HAD NOT ONCE SPOKEN TO THE PRESS IN THE PAST FIVE DAYS.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG WANTED TO TAKE A LOWER PROFILE AND SUPPORT THE NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT HOWEVER POSSIBLE.  THE AMBASSADOR OFFERED TRAINING FOR IRAQI PRESS OFFICERS.  ZEBARI WELCOMED THE OFFER.  5.  (C) ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE WAS "PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES" ON HIS LIST OF 47 CHIEFS OF MISSION TO BE SENT ABROAD, INCLUDING TO WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK.  HE SAID THE LIST WOULD BE FINALIZED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.   U.S. ASSISTANCE ---------------  6.  (C) ZEBARI EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE SLOW PACE OF U.S. SUPPLEMENTAL FUND DISBURSEMENTS.  HE URGED THE AMBASSADOR TO QUICKEN THE PACE AND NOTED THAT IN AREAS WHERE THE USG HAD BEGUN PROJECTS, LIKE IN TIKRIT, THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD SHOWN MARKED IMPROVEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ZEBARI THAT A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL HAD ACTUALLY BEEN COMMITTED THAN THE MEDIA PORTRAYED, BUT HE AGREED WITH ZEBARI THAT FUNDS NEEDED TO FLOW AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.   INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE ------------------------  7.  (C) ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS TRIP TO ISTANBUL FOR THE NATO SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS.  HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIS OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET OTHER FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS TO CONVEY THE MESSAGE THAT IRAQ NEEDED SUPPORT, SPECIFICALLY TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.  THE FRENCH DELEGATION HAD QUESTIONED ZEBARI AS TO HOW GENUINE AND REPRESENTATIONAL THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN IRAQ WAS.  THE MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE WELCOMED THE FRENCH QUESTIONS AS IT GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY.  [NOTE: THE FRENCH CHARGE IN BAGHDAD HAS YET TO SUBMIT HIS CREDENTIALS.  HOWEVER, THE CHARGE ENCOURAGED ZEBARI TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER REQUESTING THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BE RE- ESTABLISHED.  HE SAID THE FRENCH SIDE WOULD RESPOND QUICKLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.  END NOTE.]  8.  (C) ZEBARI HAD TRAVELED TO ISTANBUL ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE NATO SUMMIT FOR AN ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCES (OIC) MEETING.  HE ALSO VIEWED THIS MEETING AS A SUCCESS AND WAS PLEASED WITH THE OIC FINAL RESOLUTION, WHICH SUPPORTED THE IIG AND UNSCR 1546.  DURING THE OIC MINISTERIAL, SRSG BRAHIMI SAID THE MEETING WAS GOOD AND HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE NEXT SUCH GATHERING, WHICH EGYPT PLANNED TO HOST IN LATE JULY.  9.  (C) THE MINISTER CHARACTERIZED RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND ITS NEIGHBORS AS DIFFICULT.  ZEBARI SPECIFICALLY RAISED THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS ENTERING IRAQ FROM SYRIA AND IRAN.  HE WOULD NOT ACCUSE EITHER GOVERNMENT OF AN OFFICIAL POLICY TO SEND FOREIGN FIGHTERS, BUT ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT BOTH DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN COULD CERTAINLY DO MORE TO STOP IT.  10.  (C) WHENEVER ZEBARI RAISED THE ISSUE WITH HIS SYRIAN INTERLOCUTORS, THEY WOULD ASK ZEBARI FOR EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN INVOLVEMENT.  THE MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT EVIDENCE EXISTED; SYRIAN MEDIA "AGITATED" THE SITUATION AND FOREIGN FIGHTERS WITH SYRIAN IDENTIFICATION PAPERS HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN IRAQ.  FURTHERMORE, ZEBARI REPORTED THAT FORMER IRAQ BAQATH PARTY MEMBERS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS WERE IN SYRIA ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES TO UNDERMINE THE IIG.  ZEBARI SAID THE IIG WAS EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF CLOSING THE BORDER WITH SYRIA, BUT NOTED THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON IRAQ.  11.  (C) ACCORDING TO ZEBARI, SAUDI ARABIA AND TO A LESSER EXTENT EGYPT WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE SYRIAN POSITION.  ANOTHER ARAB FOREIGN MINISTER HAD TOLD ZEBARI THAT IRAQI FREEDOM QTERRIFIEDQ SYRIA, IRAN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.  ELECTIONS ---------  12.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ZEBARI THAT UN OFFICIALS PLANNED TO RETURN TO IRAQ SHORTLY, BOTH TO HELP WITH THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND TO WORK ON ELECTION PREPARATIONS.  REGARDING ELECTIONS, ZEBARI ARGUED THAT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WAS QTHE ONLY SAVIORQ FOR IRAQ.  PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD LEAD TO NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND QVERY LIVELYQ ALLIANCES BETWEEN ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN GROUPS.  ZEBARI CONTINUED THAT A WINNER-TAKE-ALL SYSTEM WOULD LEAD TO LARGE POLITICAL BLOCS FORMING AND POSSIBLE CIVIL WAR.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SHIQA WON AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY THROUGH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION Q "SO BE IT."  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD EXPRESSED FEARS THAT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD LEAD TO ISLAMIC EXTREMIST DOMINATION.  ZEBARI DISCOUNTED THOSE FEARS.  13.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED ZEBARI FOR SHARING HIS THOUGHTS ON ELECTIONS, AND AGREED THAT WHEN IRAQ DRAFTED ITS CONSTITUTION, IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE ALL VOICES, EVEN THOSE OF SMALL MINORITIES, TO BE HEARD.  A SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION SHOULD ALLOW FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY.   NEGROPONTE

(U) SUMMARY.  THE IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT (IIG) ENACTED A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY TODAY.  THE LAW IS AIMED AT BETTER COMBATING THE INSURGENCY WHILE MAINTAINING BASIC RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE LAW COMPLIES WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW (TAL), WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN IRAQI BILL OF RIGHTS.  POST PROVIDES COMMENTS ON THE LAW AND THE FULL TEXT OF THE LAW BELOW.  END SUMMARY.  2. (U) ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 2004, THE IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT PASSED A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY.  POST'S VIEW IS THAT THE LAW IS NOT DESIGNED TO GRANT THE IIG VAST ADDITIONAL POWERS.  TO THE CONTRARY, MOST OF WHAT THE DRAFT PERMITS COULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DONE UNDER EXISTING IRAQI LAW.  THE DRAFT SERVES AS AN OMNIBUS ORDER, CONSOLIDATING IRAQI PROCEDURES WITHIN A RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK FOR READY USE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.  THE IIG AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED SIGNALED AN INTEREST IN SUCH AN ACT TO WORK WITH CPA AND US TO ENDEAVOR THAT THE FINAL DRAFT COMPORTED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS UNDER BOTH THE TAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.  POST VIEWS THE OUTCOME AS FAVORABLE.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAW FOLLOW IN PARAGRAPH 3 AND THE FULL TEXT OF THE LAW AS TRANSLATED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY IS IN PARAGRAPH 4.  3. (U) HIGHLIGHTS.  -- THE DECREE IS NOT SELF-EXECUTING.  BOTH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY (UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THREE PERSONS) MUST DECLARE AN EMERGENCY CONDITION FOR THE DECREE TO HAVE EFFECT.  -- THE DEFINITION OF "EMERGENCY CONDITION" LIMITS APPLICATION TO A CONTINUOUS, SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE IN A PARTICULAR PART OF IRAQ THAT THREATENS THE PERSONAL SAFETY OF IRAQIS.  AN EMERGENCY CONDITION DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY APPLY NATIONWIDE.  -- ANY DECLARED EMERGENCY CONDITION AUTOMATICALLY SUNSETS AFTER 60 DAYS AND EVERY 30 DAYS THEREAFTER UNLESS REAFFIRMED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY.  -- ALL SEARCHES AND SEIZURES MUST COMPORT WITH THE TAL AND THUS REQUIRE JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION IN THE ABSENCE OF EXTREME EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  -- ALL DETAINEES MUST BE BROUGHT BEFORE A JUDGE WITHIN 24 HOURS, CONSISTENT WITH THE IRAQI CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.  -- ALL EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE DECISION TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY, ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.  -- TO THE EXTENT NEW POWERS OR PROCEDURES ARE AUTHORIZED, THEY APPLY ONLY IN AREAS OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY AND EXPIRE AFTER THE EMERGENCY.  SUCH NEW POWERS AND PROCEDURES INCLUDE:  -- LIMITED CONTROLS ON MOVEMENT, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION TO ORDER CURFEWS FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME.  -- CLOSING OR RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES OF PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS, AFTER OBTAINING A COURT ORDER.  -- ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN COVERT SURVEILLANCE MEASURES UPON JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION. -- ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR IRAQI SECURITY FORCES, ALL OF WHOM WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE PRIME MINISTER OR HIS DESIGNEE.  -- BROAD POWER TO DELEGATE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO CIVILIAN OR MILITARY OFFICIALS WHERE NECESSARY.  -- AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE ISOLATION AND ENCIRCLEMENT OF AREAS EXPERIENCING WIDESPREAD INSURRECTION.  -- AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER, WITH PRESIDENCY APPROVAL, TO GRANT PARDONS AND IMMUNITY.  THE FORMER REGIME HAD SUCH POWERS BUT THEY WERE NOT ESTABLISHED IN WRITING, THEY WERE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, AND THEY WERE SUBJECT TO ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT.  -- THE DECREE REAFFIRMS THE IIG'S COMMITMENT TO CARRYING OUT ELECTIONS BY JANUARY 1995, SAYING "IT IS NOT PERMISSIBLE TO USE ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS ORDER TO DELAY ... IONS UNDER 1546, OR IRAQI SECURITY FORCES OPERATING UNDER UNIFIED MNF-I COMMAND.  4. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF EMERGENCY LAW.

C O N F I D E N T I A L  BAGHDAD 000119   E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2024 TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KISL, IZ SUBJECT: USEB 58: Shia Leaders Petition on Behalf of Sadr  1. (U) Classified by DCM James Jeffrey, Reason 1.4 (B) and (D).  2. (C) Summary:  Last week, influential Shia leaders, including the Dawa and SCIRI parties, asked Prime Minister Allawi to defuse the tension in Najaf by dropping, at least temporarily, the charges against Muqtada al-Sadr.  They told Allawi it would be preferable for Sadr's militia, the Jaysh Al Mahdi(JAM), to become a political movement.  A senior IIG official said Allawi's initial reaction was skeptical but said the Prime Minister might be convinced to be more accommodating with Sadr and his unruly militia. End summary.  ----------------------------------- TOP SHIA POLITICIANS PLEAD FOR SADR -----------------------------------  3. (C) IIG National Security Advisor Moaffak Al-Rubaie told MNF-I LT. General McColl, and Embassy POLMIL and POL Counselors on July 7 that thirteen members of what he called the "Shia Caucus" (in Arabic, "Bayt Shia" or "Shia House") delivered a letter about defusing the problem with Muqtada al-Sadr to Prime Minister Allawi earlier this week. The thirteen included representatives from the Dawa party and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, as well as the Badr Corps.  Former Governing Council members Ahmed al-Barak and Mohammed Bahr al-Aloum were also in the group, he said.  Al-Rubaie gave PolCouns a few minutes to read the signed Arabic letter (but wouldn't let us have a copy).  4. (C) The letter opened with the petitioners' referring to a recent letter from al-Sadr to the Bayt Shia asking for their help in defusing the problems between him and the IIG.  It said the Bayt Shia wanted to build on the work of the Joint Coordination Committee now established between the Najaf governor and the Office of the Martyr Sadr in Najaf.  The petitioners said they hoped the IIG would support the Bayt Shia's effort to move from a ceasefire in Najaf and Kufa to a period of "accord" ("ittifaq" in Arabic).  They proposed four steps:  -- Prime Minister Allawi would personally engage to help solve the problem with Muqtada al-Sadr.  -- Armed men in the two holy cities of Najaf and Kufa would agree to leave and go home.  (Comment: To Baghdad's Sadr City and elsewhere in Iraq.  End comment.)  They would thereby agree to end their occupation of mosques, religious schools and shrines, and government buildings.  In addition, all sides would agree to cancel Sadr's Shari'a court rulings over an agreed period.  -- The IIG would agree to suspend ("taaleeq") the legal case against Muqtada al-Sadr until the coming ("inbithaq") of an elected government in Iraq.  -- The JAM would be developed into a political organization throughout Iraq.  -------------------------------------------- AN IMPORTANT BAGHDAD AYATOLLAH WEIGHS IN TOO --------------------------------------------  5. (C) Al-Rubaie told us that on the night of July 6 Allawi and Al-Rubaie called on Ayatollah Hussein al-Sadr at the Gadhimiya Mosque in Baghdad.  According to Al-Rubaie, Hussein al-Sadr said it would be best for the IIG not to deal with Muqtada al-Sadr directly.  Instead, the Ayatollah advised, the IIG should try to find suitable men around al- Sadr with whom the IIG can work.  (Comment: Ayatollah al- Sadr advocates avoiding violence and has been friendly to the coalition, though in earlier meetings with CPA, he generally urged that we take a tough law-enforcement approach with his nephew, Muqtada.  End comment.)  ------------------------------------------- PRIME MINISTER: INITIALLY SKEPTICAL, BUT... -------------------------------------------  6. (C) Al-Rubaie added that Allawi's initial reaction to the Bayt Shia petition was to recall that Muqtada al-Sadr had not recognized the IIG and instead had called it illegitimate.  Allawi wondered why, in this case, the IIG should suspend the legal case.  Al-Rubaie speculated, however, that Allawi might eventually decide it would be best to strike a more accomodating stance.  7. (C) POLMIL Counselor cautioned that the coalition would not want to work with Muqtada al-Sadr, given that al-Sadr was a criminal charged with a crime.  Al-Rubaie stated that if Iran controlled al-Sadr then the IIG had to take a tougher line.  Al-Rubaie commented in passing that if al- Sadr represented a more genuine constituency, then it would be harder to exclude him.  He thought the Prime Minister might ultimately draw the same conclusion.  ------- COMMENT -------  8. (C) As we are reported earlier, the JAM remains very much present in Najaf and Kufa, including at the Imam Ali Shrine; the custodian of the Imam Ali Mosque, for example, has not been able to return to Najaf.  It seems likely, therefore, that the petitioners received at least an informal blessing for their approach from key Najaf Hawza figures such as Ayatollahs Sistani and Mohammed said al- Hakim.  It is more surprising that the Bayt Shia would support the JAM becoming a political movement, as an al- Sadr political movement could poll well in some parts of Iraq at the expense of Dawa and SCIRI.  The more moderate Shia religious parties may reason that Muqtada al-Sadr would add Islamist seats to the parliament overall and they would thus be in a better position to form a largely Shia Islamist coalition with him.  Provided Muqtada al-Sadr and his supporters avoid provocation, this petition and the advice from Ayatollahs such as Hussein al-Sadr will make it harder for Allawi to exclude Muqtada's supporters from the political process.

(C) Summary.  On July 10, Iraqi Prime Minister Dr. Ayad Allawi met with the chief of the news room from Al- Jazeera's Doha headquarters, Mr. Sadi Al-Shouly (who is also responsible for all worldwide Al-Jazeera correspondents), along with Al-Jazeera's Baghdad Bureau Chief, Mr. Hamid Hadeed.  The meeting, originally scheduled to last one-half hour, was extended to an hour and a half as PM Allawi effectively read the riot act to his two visitors.  End summary.  2. (C) A witness to the session reports the following highlights.  Prime Minister Allawi opened his meeting with the two visitors from Al-Jazeera with a question: "So what are your plans for harming the Iraqi people these days?"  The deflated Al-Jazeera guests were then treated to a thorough dressing-down, with Allawi accusing Al-Jazeera of having a political agenda, and then assuring his visitors that their agenda "will fail" and that the Iraqi people will be victorious regardless of Al-Jazeera's efforts to undermine stability in the region.  3. (C) Among the specific accusations that Allawi leveled against Al-Jazeera were the following:  -- the lack of accurate and factual reporting by Al- Jazeera correspondents on the ground in Iraq;  -- the station acting as a mouthpiece for terrorists by airing their audio and video tapes;  -- and broadcasting videos of masked men trying to intimidate him and the Iraqi people.  The PM stressed that Al-Jazeera will fail in its goal, as he and his people "have been through too much hardship to be threatened by a group of masked men".  4. (C) The PM also stated that he is going to approach the Qatari government to discuss the impact that a state- run broadcaster such as Al-Jazeera has on IraqiQQatari bilateral relations.  5. (C) Allawi continued, that regardless of its efforts, 99% of the Iraqi people reject Al-Jazeera and its agenda, and are aware that Al-Jazeera never covers any positive news stories; rather, Iraqis understand that Al-Jazeera's sole interest is incitement to discontent, even violence. The PM also informed his visitors that there is now an independent Iraqi media commission that will hold media organizations accountable for malpractice and provocation.  Further, he conveyed that neither he, nor any members of his staff, will cooperate with Al-Jazeera until they adjust their coverage.  The PM did mention, however, that he will send a representative to Doha next week to represent Iraq in a conference which Al-Jazeera is holding with key political figures, in order to reiterate these points.  He concluded by acknowledging that "it is acceptable, even welcome, to criticize the Interim Government; however, do not dare harm the people of Iraq".  6. (C) The Al-Jazeera representatives got the message. For their part, they claimed that the shortfalls in Al- Jazeera coverage of Iraq cited by the PM were often due to an inability to obtain information and clarification from official sources concerning breaking news events, a lack of government spokesmen and an Iraqi Interim Government public affairs infrastructure.  7. (C) Comment: Shortly after the transfer of sovereignty to his government, PM Allawi told us that he was thinking of closing the Al-Jazeera bureau in Baghdad and banning Al-Jazeera correspondents from Iraq.  Our counsel was to take another approach;  to inform Al-Jazeera that their reporting is under scrutiny, and that the government intends to monitor media coverage through an independent commission.  PM Allawi did exactly that in his meeting with these representatives from Al-Jazeera.  End comment.   NEGROPONTE

NEGROPONTE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1. (C) SUMMARY. Prime Minister Allawi told the Deputy Secretary that he and his counterparts in the Arab world are looking forward to his tour of the region.  Allawi plans to have an open and honest discussion with Syria about their involvement in Iraqi affairs.  He would like to see Interior Ministers of regional states work together to address border security issues. Allawi said he believes that the Government is making headway against the insurgents, and he has told those fighting the Interim Government that they are welcome in the political process on condition that they work within the law.  Planning for the National Conference is coming along, but logistics and security are proving to be obstacles.  The Deputy Secretary engaged Allawi on ways to use the UN General Assembly to Iraq's advantage, and he noted that the U.S. Congress plans to stay engaged in Iraq.  Allawi said prompt implementation of U.S. reconstruction projects is essential to easing Iraq's unemployment problem.  END SUMMARY.  ---------------------------- ALLAWI TO KEY ON SYRIA FIRST ----------------------------  2. (C) Deputy Secretary Armitage met with Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi on July 18.  Ambassador Negroponte, Assistant Secretary Burns, and MNF-I Commander General Casey also attended the meeting.  Allawi opened the meeting by noting that he will leave July 19 on a trip to Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, the UAE, and Kuwait.  He said he believes his Arab neighbors are looking forward to this visit. He plans to consult with them extensively about Iraq's security.  3. (C) Allawi said that he hopes he can reason with Bashar Al- Asad of Syria, but he will be open and honest about the role that Syria has played in the insurgency in Iraq.  He said that his strategy for now is to neutralize the Syrian threat because the bigger threat is from Iran.  Allawi plans to ask King Abdullah of Jordan and President Mubarak of Egypt to put pressure on Asad to control the "nerve center" of foreign fighters and resources to the insurgency in Iraq.  The Deputy Secretary and Allawi agreed that Asad is too weak to control the elements coming out of Syria.  Allawi added that there is also evidence that Syrians are trying to rebuild the Ba'ath party under another name to run for elections in January in Iraq. Allawi mentioned that Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon told Deputy PM Barham Salih that Iraq will not make any headway with the Syrians.  However, Allawi plans to push the Syrians and demonstrate to them that a stable Iraq is in their long-term interest.  --------------------------------------- CONTRIBUTING TO THE UN PROTECTION FORCE ---------------------------------------  4. (C) The Deputy Secretary briefed Allawi on his discussions with India and Pakistan concerning assistance to Iraqi security forces and troop contributions for the UN protection force.  The Deputy Secretary told Allawi that neither he nor Secretary Powell could get a commitment from the Pakistanis to contribute troops to Iraq, noting that the GOP may not want to be the first Muslim country to commit troops.  Allawi offered to call Musharaf to discuss the issue with him, but the Deputy Secretary encouraged him to wait. The Deputy Secretary said that the Indian Government has clearly limited its offer of support to training Iraqis in India.  --------------------------- DEALING WITH THE INSURGENTS ---------------------------  5. (C) With the exception of the past few days, Allawi said that he thought that the Interim Government was making headway against the insurgents.  He told the Deputy Secretary that he had some discussions with insurgents and he delivered a firm message: "bring on violence and we will fight you; you are welcome in the political process, but you must work within the law."  The Deputy Secretary asked about the situation in Samara, which Allawi acknowledged is a problematic area.  Allawi described how he had met with Samarans with the clear message that unless they choose the political path, he would confront them.  Allawi added that the Samarans did not have too many demands, and those that they have can be met.  Allawi outlined his demands of the Samarans: 1) surrender criminals; 2) cooperate with the multinational forces; and 3) pass information to the authorities that will improve security.  He underscored that he has constantly emphasized that nobody is above the law and criminals will be punished.  6. (C) Allawi told the Deputy Secretary that the IIG is working to ensure that essential services are provided.  U.S. reconstruction projects are very important because they will alleviate the unemployment problem Iraqis face.  Allawi has asked his ministers to provide weekly reports on essential services so that he can track improvements and publicize successes.  He has also asked the Minister of Health to report on civilian casualties caused by insurgents and the Minister of Electricity to report on the how the insurgents have affected the use of electricity in Iraq.  Allawi plans to publicize the reports to show Iraqis how disruptive the insurgents are to the Iraqis' safety, security, and well-being.  ----------------------- THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE -----------------------  7. (C) Although the political process is moving forward and preparations for the National Conference are coming along, Allawi said that logistics such as hotel rooms, Conference venue, and security are key challenges.  Allawi would like to the see the Conference shortened to two or even one day from its current three days in order to ease the logistical and security difficulties.  He said that the Conference will either take place at the Convention Center or at Baghdad University. "We are definitely going to proceed with it," he added.  The Deputy Secretary underscored the importance of the Conference, adding that it will be a milestone for Iraq, demonstrating to Iraqis and the international community the GovernmentQs ability to make decisions and follow through on initiatives.  8. (C) Allawi mentioned that Iraq is still lacking a good program for reconciliation and national unity but he hopes that the National Conference will be a starting point for discussions.  He added that he hopes his trip through the region will help with a dialogue on reconciliation.  He also wants to organize a meeting of the interior ministers from Iraq's neighbors to discuss the security situation and border security which will help with the same process of reconciliation.  ------------------------------- UNGA AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IRAQ -------------------------------  9. (C) The Deputy Secretary urged Allawi to make good use of the UN General Assembly session in September to talk with his counterparts in the Arab world and beyond.  Allawi acknowledged that he had not thought about UNGA, but he did not think that it would be particularly useful.  Instead, he proposed a meeting that would include G-8 countries, Egypt, Morocco, and other Islamic countries to specifically discuss the stability of Iraq. Allawi said that such a meeting could empower Iraq to send a message to Iran and Syria, and he thought it would be a useful tool to reflect on security in the region.  10. (C) The meeting ended by Allawi thanking the Deputy Secretary for the United States' continued support.  The Deputy Secretary stressed the U.S. commitment to Iraq.  The U.S. is focused on speeding up the disbursement of funds that Congress appropriated for Iraq's reconstruction.  Ambassador Negroponte added that he and the Deputy Prime Minister met to discuss forming a joint U.S.-Iraqi committee that will talk about the best way to spend the appropriations.   NEGROPONTE

NEUMANN FOR REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D).  1.  (C) Summary.  Sunnis are hostile, divided, leaderless, and unable to envision a political solution acceptable to others according to a very well-informed Jordanian diplomat.  Some would like to enter into an agreement with us to resume rule, an approach we find illusionary. End summary.  2.  (C) Pol Counselor Ford and Pol-Mil Counselor Neumann met July 20 with Jordanian Charge Demi Haddad (strictly protect).  Haddad has extensive Sunni contacts built up over several years in Iraq.  He reports that more Sunnis than ever are coming through his doors.  The picture he painted was depressing.  Haddad said that after nearly 100 years of repressive rule the Sunnis cannot envision a situation in which they can protect their interests without domination.  The only alternative appears to be permanent suppression.  Although outsiders see the potential for an alliance with the Kurds to block Shi'ite domination, Haddad said there is too much bloodshed between the communities. The logic might work in another decade but the Sunnis do not believe in it now.  3.  (C) There are multiple Sheikhs and sheikh-ly contenders in the Sunni ranks.  There is no agreement on leadership among them.  Efforts to consolidate under any one leader meet internal opposition.  Without a single strong leader to give form to new ideas, the tribesmen fall back into hostility and resentment.  4.  (C) Haddad said he finds the Sunnis chasing half-formed conceptions.  Several Sheikhs have suggested that the only way to impose leadership on Iraq is to return to a monarchy.  But they cannot name an acceptable candidate. They typify Sharif Ali as the "son of an Egyptian whore." They believe the U.S. is hostile to Prince Hassan bin Tallal of Jordan and therefore discount him.  A third candidate is said to be timid and attracts no support.  Yet Sunni Sheiks continue to argue for a monarchy as a principle, even though they cannot figure out how it would work.  5.  (C) Some of the Sheiks continue to hope they can make a "deal" to rule Iraq in return for concessions to U.S. interests.  This view is supported by many conversations we have had that focus on themes of "give us jobs, pay us" and all will be calm.  "You can realize your American interests and we'll all be rich."  COMMENT -------  6.  (C) Clearly not every Sunni falls into this description.  Yet it suggests that for many the continued fighting is seen as their only alternative to being ruled. Their image of a deal to make them again the rulers of Iraq strikes us as fanciful.  7.  (C) The Shia genie is out of the bottle.  The Kurds have too many memories of suppression to go down the Sunni road.  And the Sunni themselves are far too divided to make and keep a bargain.  Probably the best we can hope for is that as the IIG gains credibility and strength, Sunni elements will decide, incrementally, to cut deals to join a process they cannot stop.  Some, like President Ghazi, have already made their accommodation.   NEGROPONTE

The first letter (Ref A) concerns two Pakistani ICRC interviewees who informed ICRC that they had been transferred to Afghanistan from Iraq while in Coalition custody, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The second letter (Ref B) concerns ICRC objections to the Coalition's provision of timely information regarding detentions and detainees to ICRC officials.  END SUMMARY.  3. (C) International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) Baghdad Head of Delegation Christophe Beney delivered copies of two letters (Refs A and B) to Pol-Mil Minister Ambassador Neumann.  Both letters are dated July 20, 2004. Both are addressed to Gen. George W. Casey, Commanding General, MNF-I, and both are copied to Ambassador Negroponte and Major General Geoffrey Miller, Deputy Commanding General for Detainee Operations, MNF-I.  4. (C) Begin text of Ref A.  The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) would like to submit to your attention the following issue of great concern.  During an ICRC visit to Camp Bagram Collection Point (BCP) in Afghanistan on 24 to 28 May, 2004, the ICRC met two Pakistani internees who claimed to have been arrested in Iraq at the end of February 2004. These individuals, who identified themselves respectively as Amanullah and Salah Mohammad Ali Al-Hayyan, were allegedly arrested in Baghdad by U.S. forces. They claimed to have been detained for approximately one month in Iraq, presumably in Abu Ghraib, prior to their transfer to BCP at the end of March.  During private interviews with other internees at the time of the 24 to 28 May visit to BCP, the ICRC also received allegations of the detention in Afghanistan of two other persons who had been arrested in Iraq. The concerned individuals were identified to the ICRC as: Abdallah, Saudi, and Hossam, Yemeni, both arrested in March 2004 in Fallujah. Both were allegedly transferred from Iraq to an undisclosed place of detention run by U.S. services in Afghanistan, a place of detention to which ICRC has not been granted access. Both internees were allegedly transferred out of this place to an unknown destination in April 2004. In addition, these four individuals were neither notified to the ICRC in Iraq nor met by the ICRC during the course of its visits there.  The ICRC would like to emphasize that Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (GC IV) prohibits forcible transfers of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country regardless of their motive. The violation of Article 49 constitutes a grave breach of the GC IV, as provided in Article 147 GC IV. The ICRC therefore calls upon U.S. authorities to investigate the circumstances in which this violation could have occurred and to take the necessary measures as required by Article 146 GC IV.  The ICRC is deeply concerned for the welfare of internees transferred out of Iraq and recalls its request to be notified in a timely manner of all arrests made there. The ICRC further requests to be informed of the whereabouts of those who have been transferred to undisclosed locations and asks that it be granted access to them without delay.  Copies of this letter are also being provided to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the Commander of the CJTF 180 in Afghanistan. In Washington, copies are being provided to the relevant authorities of the Pentagon, State Department, and National Security Council, in furtherance of the ICRC's dialogue with U.S. authorities on issues of U.S. detention policy and practices.  We thank you in advance for your cooperation and remain, Yours sincerely, Christophe Beney, Head of Delegation, ICRC Iraq".  End text.  5. (C) Begin text of Ref B.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would like to draw your attention to the following issues of concern.  The existing system of notification to the ICRC of persons captured and detained under the control of the U.S. authorities in Iraq has led to instances in which notifications have not always been complete and timely. In some cases, the ICRC discovered that it had not been notified about the capture and internment of certain individuals, and that such individuals were not presented to the ICRC during its visits to internment facilities in Iraq.  Notification should include: the surname, first names, place and date of birth, nationality, place of last residence, distinguishing characteristics, father's first name, mother's maiden name, the date, place, and nature of the action taken with regard to the individual, the address at which correspondence may be sent to him, and the name and address of the internee's contact person.  It is also essential that ICRC receives all capture cards correctly completed upon capture, a complete list of the population of each place of internment at the time of each ICRC visit, and, on a weekly basis, a consolidated list of all persons who are held under the responsibility of U.S. authorities for more than 14 days. Appropriate information must also be provided concerning transfers, releases, deaths or escapes.  The following examples illustrate the problem of absence or delayed notification of persons deprived of their liberty held by U.S. authorities in Iraq:  (1) In its letter BAG-Field 04/184, dated 4 March 2004, addressed to Lieutenant General R. Sanchez, Commander CJTF- 7, the ICRC reported the case of three Saudi nationals who were not notified until five weeks after their arrest. The delay of notification was most likely decided by those responsible for their interrogation. The ICRC still expects a reply from the U.S. authorities on this serious problem of delayed notification.  (2) Two Pakistani internees (Amanullah and Salah Mohammed Ali Al-Hayyan) met by the ICRC during a visit to Bagram Collection Point in Afghanistan in May 2004 claimed that they had been interned under U.S. control in Iraq, probably in Abu Ghraib, between February and March 2004. Both internees were eventually transferred to Bagram Collection Point at the end of March. The ICRC has raised the issue of transfers of internees from Iraq to Afghanistan in its letter Bag 07/747, dated July 20.  (3) U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated publicly on 17 June 2004 that an internee had been hidden from ICRC in Iraq for seven months. It was only after this announcement, and upon the ICRC's repeated insistence to be provided with the name of this individual, that the U.S. authorities in Iraq informed the ICRC of the identity of the concerned person. A 04 July 2004 letter signed by Major General G. Miller indicated the name as Hiea Abdrumen Rassul currently held in Camp Cropper.  With regard to each of these cases, the ICRC is concerned that the lack of notification was not the result of administrative mistakes, but rather a deliberate decision not to allow the ICRC to perform its functions in a satisfactory manner.  Therefore, we respectfully request that you give all the necessary instructions to ensure that the ICRC is notified of all arrests in a timely, reliable, and complete manner.  We thank you in advance for your cooperation and remain, Yours sincerely, Christophe Beney, Head of Delegation, ICRC Iraq.  End text of Ref B.   6.

(S) SUMMARY:  PolMilCouns Ambassador Neumann and PolCouns Robert Ford, along with staff, traveled to Fallujah for a familiarization visit on 14 July, 2004 to meet with 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (1MEF) CG Conway, 1st Marine Divison (MARDIV) CG Mattis, and Regimental Combat Team 1 (RCT-1) Col Toolan.  The Marines presented the recent timeline of events in Fallujah from late March 2004, when Americans were murdered in the city and Marines were subsequently ordered in, through the present situation, characterized by an uneasy stand-off between the Coalition security forces and a collection of locals making up the Fallujah Brigade.  They displayed a cautious sense of optimism about the growing internal divide between moderates and extremists within the city.  1MEF is focusing on accelerating a handover of security to local Iraqi control by 31 December and was aware of the necessary hurdles to overcome in order for that goal to be achieved.  END SUMMARY.  2. (S) Commanding General 1st MARDIV Mattis and RCT-1 Commander Colonel Toolan briefed the timeline of events that took place in Fallujah from late March 2004 through the creation of the "Fallujah Brigade" to the present situation.  They discussed the attacks on Americans on March 31, offensive operations by the Marines in early April, the negotiations with various local leaders and Governing Council representatives, and the present "wait and see" strategy-- essentially a middle ground between destruction and rebuilding.  Fallujah remains a denied area to the Marines, and while the Marines are not undertaking offensive operations, they are also not at liberty to funnel civil/military funding to the city since they do not have freedom of movement.  As a consequence, USD 27 million worth of projects remains on hold for Fallujah itself, whereas in the surrounding areas, such as Qarmah and Saqlawiyah, there are USD 13 million worth of projects ongoing.  The 1st MARDIV hopes that this dichotomy will make Fallujans realize it is to their benefit to work constructively with Coalition forces.  3.  (S) The Marines indicated they have a strong troop concentration in Fallujah's outlying areas, which has helped to stabilize the city's surrounding towns, whereas insurgents and foreign fighters largely operate without constraint within the city, where the Fallujah Brigade and other Iraqi security forces have failed to secure the city.  Coalition forces are still seeking to disrupt insurgents and foreign jihadists with surgical strikes against Abu Mus'ab al Zarqawi-related targets within the town in order to prevent Fallujah from operating as a safe-haven for extremists.  Marines viewed the Fallujah Brigade as having failed to provide security, but they did view the force as "buying time" for the Coalition forces to create a rift between moderates and extremists.  1MEF also appeared optimistic about new Iraqi security forces, indicating there is ever- increasing coordination between the Iraqi National Guard and the Iraqi police.  4.  (S) Civil affairs officers attached to RCT-1 view their increasing contacts with area residents, the contracts they've awarded, and the compensation claims they honored to repair homes and buildings after the April conflict as driving a wedge between moderates and extremists in Fallujah.  These compensation payments have stopped due to the hardliners' control of the city. More Fallujans are realizing these benefits of Coalition presence and are edging away from extremists. Likewise, the release of prominent Fallujah imam Shaykh Jamal Shakir al-Nazzal and Albu Issa Shaykh Barakat Sa'dun al-Issawi have added voices of moderation in Fallujah and among insurgents since their release from Abu Ghurayb prison in April 2004.  In the Marines' estimation, most Fallujah residents are growing weary of foreign fighters and Islamic extremists, and are tolerant of the recent surgical strikes against Zarqawi related targets.  The U.S. military's Fallujah Liaison Center (FLC), located approximately 2.5 miles from Fallujah, in between the city and 1MEF/RCT-1 headquarters, is a neutral area that serves as the main point of interaction between Coalition forces and Fallujah citizens.  The civil affairs team reported a large daily stream of businessmen, local shaykhs, Iraqi security forces, and average residents who come to bid for contracts, submit claims, or lodge complaints.  5.  (C) 1MEF and 1st MARDIV reported that Fallujans and residents from Al Anbar still resent and often complain that they have no representation in the new Iraqi Interim Government and that Baghdad does not represent their interests -- a view similar to their estimation of the former Governing Council. Most Fallujah residents have little connection to Baghdad and appear more focused on local problems or contentions with local officials and tribes in Ramadi.  6.  (S)  1MEF, which takes a strategic view of its AOR, Al Anbar and Northern Babil province, is looking towards transitioning to local control by 31 December, facilitating participation in the national elections in January, and achieving Iraqi self- governance in the Anbar governorate and in Northern Babil.  They laid out a combined approach of security and stability operations, information operations, and civil affairs projects and activities in order to achieve this goal.  Improvement of the Iraqi security forces is central to this purpose, and 1MEF has seen improvements in this area, with ISF becoming more receptive and taking on a more proactive role.  Containing the border is also a key undertaking, however at this point only eight of the planned 32 border posts have been built.  7.  (C) Comment:  The Marines are looking to more closely meld the political and military processes, including coordination and decisions, as well as achieve closer contact with the IIG and the Embassy.  The Marines said they would welcome monthly visits from the Embassy for further coordination.  They also look forward to the assignment of a long-term Department of State embedded person, but caution that short duration TDYers are not sufficient to build understanding of the area.

The Arab villages west and south of Kirkuk are mostly poor and underdeveloped.  Thanks to extensive work by the Coalition Provisional Authority, USAID and U.S. military forces in the area, the USG has developed excellent working relationships with local tribal and political leaders.  A visit by Kirkuk Embassy Regional Office PolOffs on July 15 to two of these villages - Rashad and Yaychi - shows how villagers are adjusting to life after transition.  END SUMMARY.  ---------------------- U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE ----------------------  2. Changes in Rashad and Yaychi since the handover of sovereignty have been significant.  Violence has decreased, IED attacks against U.S. military convoys are at a post- liberation low, and local authorities take particular pride in keeping their villages crime free.  Gaines Mills, the nearest military forward operating base to both Rashad and Yaychi, houses a unit from the Second Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division based at Kirkuk Air Base. The base sits in a huge open field 30 kilometers west of Kirkuk.  The only other FOB in the area - McHenry -- is 70 kilometers away and covers the villages of Hawija, Riyad and areas further west.  In all, the two FOBs cover hundreds of villages, conducting patrols and engaging with local leaders on a regular basis.  Officers from the U.S. Embassy's Regional Office in Kirkuk accompany them when time permits.  They visited the towns on July 15.  ------ RASHAD ------  3. It took PolOffs 55 minutes to drive from Kirkuk to Rashad, 45 kilometers to the southwest.  Along the paved road, shacks sold ice, wheat and produce.  Lamb carcasses hung from hooks in the 110 degree heat of the morning. Along the way, a short bridge crossing an aqueduct flowed with water.  After the bridge, hints of greenery appeared, sunflowers and flocks of sheep and goats dotted the landscape.  Agriculture and livestock form the area's economic backbone.  4. Rashad Township consists of 66 villages, some with as few as three households, some with hundreds, covering a large area of Kirkuk Province that stretches south to the border with Salah al-Din.  The main road from Kirkuk to Tikrit bisects the region.  Unpaved roads lead to some villages, while others have no vehicle access at all.  5. A collection of mud and brick structures two minutes off the road make up Rashad, the main town in a district of 20,000 people.  The majority of the population is Arab, mostly from the Al-Ubaidi tribe, one of the oldest and largest in Iraq.  The houses in the town blend into the surrounding brown terrain -- except for three new, white structures: the police station, the city council building, and the communications center.  Coalition funds built all three.  6. Except for three policemen standing guard outside the new station, Rashad's streets were empty when PolOffs arrived.  The police chief's office was spacious and air conditioned but plain.  His desk was bare except for the desk set, an Iraqi flag and a telephone on one corner.  The telephone only recently started working -- the first to work in the township since the liberation.  7. Ten men buzzed about inside the office.  Four wore traditional garb: headscarves and robes.  Two wore business attire.  The rest wore crisp, new police uniforms, all provided by CPA.  The men in traditional garb were shaikhs, including Shaikh Louis, the mayor of Rashad.  ------------------------- U.S. ASSISTANCE TO RASHAD -------------------------  8. The U.S. military has provided USD 400,000 in assistance to Rashad since liberation, drawn from the Commander's Emergency Relief Program (CERP).  The money paid for police checkpoints, new schools, bridges, water trucks and the communications center.  9. Shaikh Louis pointed out that the village's needs remain great: water, electricity, roads and a new hospital. Residents cannot safely consume the local well water, and the six water trucks that CPA bought for  USD 20,000 cannot deliver to all the villages.  If the Coalition were to pave more roads, Shaikh Louis said, water delivery would be easier.  Electrical service is erratic, and the mayor said Rashad needs additional electrical lines.  To get medical aid, citizens must be taken to Kirkuk.  There are two local doctors, but they are ill-equipped.  The police chief said that when one of his men is shot, there is no way to provide emergency treatment short of driving to Kirkuk.  ---------- CEREMONIES ----------  10. At the city council building, the mayor and the local U.S. military commander raised the Iraqi flag over the building in a symbolic display of the handover from CPA authority to local governance.  Speeches followed, with town council members and civil servants braving the intense midday heat to attend.  Two U.S. government-funded members of the Kirkuk press recorded the event.  11. The big event on July 7, when PolOffs visited, was the opening of the new communications center.  The center has the capacity for 500 telephone lines, where none existed in the town since the war.  Before the opening, residents of Rashad had to drive to Kirkuk to make a phone call.  -------------------- THE KURDISH QUESTION --------------------  12. Few Kurds live in the surrounding area, but animosity toward them is strong.  Two policemen had been shot and wounded in Rashad the night before PolOffs' visit, one fatally.  Describing the incident the police chief said it was surely the work of "outsiders," meaning Kurdish infiltrators.  13. There were also complaints about ministry offices in Kirkuk, many now dominated by Kurds.  For example, Rashad's leaders complained that the Department of Water, which is run by Kurds, has stopped up the water pipes that Arab farmers depend on to water their crops.  The mayor and others listed additional grievances: Kurds are taking Arab land and the Kirkuk police chief is biased against Arabs. When asked to provide proof, a shaikh left the room and returned with a DVD.  On the television screen, the Kirkuk chief of police was shown making what looks like a stump speech: "Kirkuk is not just a part of Kurdistan.  Kirkuk is the heart of Kurdistan."  He repeated the phrase twice. Rashad's political elite said they believe their case is open and shut.  ------ YAYCHI ------  14. Yaychi is 60 kilometers northeast of Rashad and resembles its sister town in some ways: the brown hut-like houses; power lines running in all directions; and a few new buildings that stand apart.  In some ways, the two are distinct.  In Yaychi, the schools are painted with splashes of color, children play outside and people are on the streets even in the 120 degree midday heat.  ------------------------- U.S. ASSISTANCE TO YAYCHI -------------------------  15. Where the police chief's office in Rashad was stark, the mayor's office was steeped with paperwork and pictures of himself with U.S. military personnel.  After greeting PolOffs, Yaychi's Mayor Abdul Kareem broke into a serenade of thanks for all the projects the U.S. has brought his people.  Yaychi has received USD 250,000 worth of U.S. military aid from CERP funds.  A man brought forward a two- and-a-half meter tall, one meter wide board filled with photos and descriptions of projects the town has completed with these DFI funds: new schools, new mosques, a renovated hospital, paved roads, new bridges, a police station, even a veterinary hospital.  He then handed certificates of thanks to each military officer in the room and had his photo taken handing them out.  16. The local Coalition military commander gave a short speech that climaxed in the statement that these projects were a "testimony of a government that cares about its people."  Mentioning the oil pipeline that runs through the villages, he said that "attacks on the pipeline directly hurt the people of this community."  He also encouraged Yaychi's people to turn in to proper authorities those who would harm the township.  Mayor Abdul Kareem responded with the message that "our economy is improving....everyone has benefited from liberation," ending with "Thank you for our liberation."  ---------- CEREMONIES ----------  17. The visit to Yaychi had the same purpose as the visit to Rashad  a ceremonial handover of sovereignty from CPA to the local government and a flag-raising in front of the city council building to mark the occasion.  A small group of people witnessed the ceremony and listened as local dignitaries make speeches.  Along with all the members of the Yaychi town council, the police chief from Rashad came as a visiting public figure.  He said he plans to combine the two localities' police forces under his command.  18. With one ceremony over, the group piled into new, CPA- purchased police trucks for a two-minute drive to the highlight of the day: the ribbon-cutting at a new marketplace established with CERP funds.  The marketplace contained six cement stalls linked together on the outskirts of town.  The mayor and the U.S. military commander surrounded themselves with locals and created a ceremony for the ribbon cutting.  "Tomorrow," the mayor said aloud, "people selling food, drinks, clothing and other goods will fill these stalls."  --------------------------- AGAIN, THE KURDISH QUESTION ---------------------------  19. Of the 38 villages in Yaychi, three are Kurdish and another three Turkman, so residents rarely blame particular "outsiders" for town problems.  Still, during PolOffs' visit, council members poured their problems on the military commander and hinted at a Kurdish conspiracy.  The municipal departments in Kirkuk continued to ignore them, and the council members pointed specifically to three departments -- agriculture, water and municipalities -- all Kurdish-controlled.  The members said that they did not feel a particular discrimination against Kurds, the people of Yaychi only want the services they feel they are due.  20. The complaints continued.  The mayor has to pay for his own bodyguards.  None of the department employees come from Kirkuk to visit them or hear their requests.  The local Government receives complaints in Kurdish and feels compelled to respond to the complaints, but has no Kurdish translators.  "Arabic is the language of the Koran.  It should be good enough for Yaychi," one council member concluded.  -------------- OTHER VILLAGES --------------  21. The Coalition has assisted many other villages in Kirkuk besides Rashad and Yaychi.  USAID, for example, provided 13 km of paved road in the far southwest corner of Kirkuk province near the village of al-Asfar.  The project cost USD 557,000 of which USAID contributed USD 429,000 drawn from appropriated funds under the Community Action Program (CAP).  The remainder came from local contributions.  Local government teams with AID contractor RTI worked with the local council committees in training them on preparing bid packages and making transparent decisions.   Negroponte

Derse FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S) On July 25, Ahmed Salman, legal advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Baram Salih, met with EMIN and Embassy Legal Adviser at the DPM's request to discuss the USG's proposed order on insurgent finance.  Salman said that the DPM would be seeking an appointment on July 26 to meet with Ambassador Negroponte to discuss the issue further.   He said the DPM remains very concerned with respect to the specific scope of the order and who would be subject to it.  For example, the DPM is worried that a member of the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) could be designated as an insurgent under the order, depending on the definition.  In addition, the DPM is concerned with how "insurgent" would be defined and what role, if any, the IIG would have in determining who is subject to the order.  Salman noted that the position the DPM takes in principle on the desirability of the proposed order would depend on the scope of the order, ie, to whom this would apply.  He also said that the DPM needs to better understand the details in order to take a position.  He asked whether a list of specific entities or individuals had been prepared.  He noted that Iraq probably did have legal authority under existing law to implement similar provisions per Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Order 93.  He undertook to raise again with the DPM the issue of adding "Iraqi forces" to the list of targets. We underscored Washington's interest in receiving IIG views as soon as possible.   NEGROPONTE

(C)  Summary:  The Governor of Anbar Province, perhaps the most violence-plagued part of Iraq, feels isolated and trapped in his office while he tries to secure the release of his three kidnapped sons.  The Governor doubts he can trust either the police chief or the Iraqi National Guard Commander in Anbar.  The Governor has talked of resigning as part of a bargain to gain his sons' release, but he told the Interior Minister that he will stay.  Even if he does, the credibility of Iraqi security forces in Anbar has taken a hit.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Anbar Provincial Governor Burgis' three eldest sons were kidnapped on the night of July 28.   Iraqi police guarding the Governor's residence were either ineffectual in defending the Governor's family or complicit in the commission of the crime.  Iraqi police and other security forces have since claimed they have no evidence to follow, according to the State Department liaison officer embedded with military forces in Ramadi.  3.  (C) In the days since the kidnapping, Burgis seems to be in touch with the kidnappers, who appear to be linked terrorist groups, and will meet their demands for his sons' release.  An aide to the Governor said that the motive for the kidnapping appears to be forcing the Governor's resignation.  This aide also claims that the Governor and he both believe the Police Chief and the Iraqi National Guard Commander are complicit in the kidnapping.  Burgis has met with US military personnel and the Ramadi State Department liaison officer, but has shared little information concerning the whereabouts and identity of the kidnappers.  Burgis even went so far as to ask the Marine Commanding General for help on paying the ransom, according to the liaison officer.  4.  (C)  In the midst of this, the Governor has basically stopped work.  Since there is no Deputy Governor in Anbar, the functions of the Governor's post are not being fulfilled.  5.  (C)  On August 1, ADCM and PolCouns met with Deputy Prime Minister Salih to urge the interim Government to respond quickly.  Salih said the Interior Minister would visit Anbar on August 2.  He acknowledged that the Government might need to find a new Governor, but no candidate immediately came to mind.  He also cautioned that the Governorate Council would probably have to elect the new governor.  PolCouns asked if the IIG could invoke the new state security law to enable the IIG to make the appointment of a governor.  Salih responded that it would be very difficult to utilize the law in Anbar now. According to the DPM, the IIG had not prepared public opinion for such a step.  6.  (C)  On the evening of August 2, Minister of Interior Felah Naqib arrived in Ramadi and met the Governor.  Naqib urged Anbar officials to send a delegation to Baghdad on Saturday, August 7 to discuss the situation further. Deputy PM Salih told A/DCM on August 2 that Governor Burgis told the Interior Minister Naqib that he will not resign.  7.  (C)  On August 3, the Ramadi liaison officer reported that the Anbar Provincial Council Vice=President told him on August 2 that a Sheikh Nassir of the Fahdawi tribe has proposed new candidates for the governor and empty provincial council slots.  The names proposed allegedly all are from the Fahdawi tribe (to which the local Iraqi National Guard commander also belongs) and the al-Wani tribe (to which the Police Chief belongs).  8.(C) Comment:  Anbar has a difficult security environment and now its local government is in a state of crisis, with the Governor unable to trust those around him and unable to function.  Although Burgis told Interior Minister Naqib that he will hang on, our sense is that he is looking for a way out of Ramadi in any case (On July 23, Burgis already told visiting Polcouns that he wanted to quit).  Even if the Anbar Governor stays, his ability to function is at question amidst the antagonism he confronts with some of the tribes.  The credibility of the Iraqi security forces in Anbar also is in question. End Comment.   Negroponte 
C O N F I D E N T I A L  BAGHDAD 000463  STATE FOR PM DAS LIKENS, PMAT AND NEA/I  E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/14 TAGS: MOPS, PTER, PREL, PGOV, IZ SUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR DISCUSSES CEASEFIRE TERMS WITH MOQTADA AL SADR BUT PM NOT ON BOARD  CLASSIFIED BY POL-MIL COUNSELOR RONALD E. NEUMANN FOR REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D).  1. (C) Muaffaq al Rubaie, reached at our initiative in the afternoon of August 13, said he was approaching agreement with an envoy of Moqtada al Sadr over a nine point peace plan (para 6 below.)  Apparently Rubaie had never been able to meet with Sadr but met several times with his envoy.  A ceasefire originally established only to facilitate the meeting has lasted most of the day.  The nine-point plan appears to have numerous weaknesses including: agreement on a pull-back by Coalition Forces; no timeline for turning over control of the mosques to the Iraqi government; and an open-ended provision for security forces for Moqtada and his Lieutenants.  2. (C) Ambassador Negroponte, General Casey and Pol-Mil Counselor Neumann met with Prime Minister Allawi at 1600 hours.  Allawi had not talked to Muaffaq since 0900 hours. He had not heard of the nine-point plan.  Allawi said his instructions had been to tell Sadr he had to get his forces out of Najaf and disband them and Sadr could be allowed to enter the political process.  Allawi said of the nine points, "thatQs too much."  Allawi said he felt that Sadr was not serious and would not sign even these points.  He believed Sadr was trying to drag out negotiations and that it wasn't in the government's interest.  3. (C) Allawi said that Iraqis are encouraged to move to the opposition by displays of weakness.  This is what happened earlier with both the spring negotiations with Moqtada and Fallujah.  He believes it important not to do that again.  4. (C) Allawi is waiting for the return today of Defense Minister Sha'lan, who is in Najaf.  Allawi will contact us as soon as he hears from MOD.  Allawi is very conscious that military operations have been interrupted and that time is being lost.  5. (C) Comment: We saw no evidence in Allawi's comments or behavior that Rubaie is negotiating the weaker approach of the nine points on instruction from his boss.  Allawi said that he has not come under any serious political pressure from the other Shia religious leaders.  Although Allawi does not like the fact that Vice President Jafari and the Dawa Party are calling for a cease fire (staking out some distance in case operations fail), he does not seem inclined to change his approach.  SCIRI and its head Hakim have not said anything publicly.  Allawi felt that news coverage of Najaf exaggerated the situation but did not seem bothered by that either.  6.  (C) Following are the nine points as taken down orally by telephone.  Nine-Point Plan:  1) MNF-I pullout of Najaf and Kufa with the exception of Military Police Trainers;  2) SADR movement will work in constructive way with IIG to ensure security and stability in IQ and an honest election of a full, independent, elected government;  3) Legal Case referred to Majariyh (or tribal customs?);  4) Removal of all military, armed fighters and arms from whole governate with exception of para 6.  Najaf city administration and city security is duty of IIG and ISF, including inner city and shrine;  5) JM - declare JM is not an armed militia but a popular ideological movement and, for the sake of preserving holy cities and keeping blood of our  sons, request all members lay down arms and dissolve all C2 centers and military and security establishments and handover all non-personal arms.  Members of this army can only carry arms under IQ law like other citizens;  6) Personal Security:  MS has right to keep personal security for him, his offices and his lieutenants like any other distinguished dignitary in IQ political arena;  7) Holy Shrine:  i. administration by persons appointed by Majariyh;  ii. forbidden to use shrine for political purposes; especially for political offices and Friday sermons;  8) Release of all detainees and prisoners and those kidnapped in recent events (Note, this seems to refer to those detained in recent fighting only);  9) Establish joint committee for coordination and follow up.  7. (C) There are many things we do not like about these ideas.  Among them are a pullout of Coalition Forces, the lack of a definite time line and no commitment to a public statement.  MAS and his lieutenants have large numbers of "bodyguards" who have often been the main actors in illegal and bullying actions.  We noted some of these deficiencies to Allawi, who agreed.

(C) Some angry remarks at the National Conference notwithstanding, it appears that the Shia establishment is not rallying behind Muqtada al-Sadr in his standoff against the Iraqi Government.  Late on the night of August 14, PolCouns spoke to a top aide to Iraqi Government Vice President and Da'wa Party leader Ibrahim Jaaferi.  The aide stated that Da'wa would not boycott the National Conference under any circumstance.  According to the aide, Jaaferi stood by his call for a peaceful solution to the battle in Najaf.  Jaaferi understands that the Mahdi militia must disarm and the city be returned entirely to Government control.  Jaaferi recognizes the danger of making concessions to militias nationwide and the need to reestablish law and order.  Jaaferi's aide urged the U.S. to stay engaged in helping to restore stability in Iraq and assisting the country's political development.  2.  (C) Meanwhile, a key Government minister from another major Shia establishment party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), told the Ambassador on August 14 that the National Conference must succeed. Finance Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said the Government made a mistake in opening negotiations with Sadr and that, if Sadr disavows violence and agrees to play a constructive role, military operations against him should recommence.  3.  (C) PolCouns spoke on the evening of August 14 with Radwan Abbas, the custodian of Najaf's Imam Ali mosque who fled Najaf four months ago and is now in Baghdad.  Abbas assured PolCouns that the Najaf cleric establishment (Hawza) supports IIG and Coalition efforts to remove the Mahdi militia from Najaf/Kufa and the religious sites.  He said many clerics had to flee Najaf for their safety and many had come to Baghdad.  Abbas discounted the likelihood of public criticism from the Hawza if the Iraqi Government sends in forces to free the mosque from Sadr forces.  He pointed to the silence of late from the Hawza and quoted an Arabic proverb meaning that silence is a sign of consent. (He urged that we not send Coalition forces into the mosque, however.)  4.  (C) On the morning of August 15, delegates from these Shia parties attended the Conference in large numbers.  A top SCIRI official in troubled Basra told the Regional Embassy Office on August 14 that he would attend the Conference as planned.  PolOffs at the Conference reported that there would be some speeches in support of a peaceful solution to the conflict in Najaf.  Post has also seen reports of a brief demonstration by Shia attendees of the National Conference demanding peace in Najaf.  The protest reportedly ended quickly and the Conference continued. There was also apparently some discussion of the Conference organizing a mission to go to Najaf directly to help facilitate a negotiated end to the standoff.  It was not clear if, in fact, such a team would actually go to Najaf.  5.  (C) COMMENT: Publicly expressed concerns about Najaf notwithstanding, the two main Shia political parties are not rushing to help Sadr (their potential political competitor).  Instead, Dawa and SCIRI are holding fast to the political process launched by the Government, symbolized now by the National Conference.  The lack of criticism against the Government or the Coalition from the Najaf Hawza, combined with the prospect of making inroads into the National Council through participation in the ongoing National Conference, give those parties incentive to continue staying with the Government.  The crowds gathering at the Imam Ali mosque make good TV images, but Post does not yet sense that Sadr is gaining any traction with the Shia establishment.   Negroponte 
C O N F I D E N T I A L  BAGHDAD 000531   E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/17/14 TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PARM, KISL, SOCI, IZ SUBJECT: SHAHRISTANI COMMENTS ON NAJAF  CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS ROBERT FORD FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D).  1. (C) SUMMARY. In his call on Ambassador Negroponte, Dr. Hussain al-Shahristani was critical of the Iragi Interim Government's (IIG) handling of the situation in Najaf, believing that it has made Muqtada al-Sadr stronger and has cost the Government much support.  He urged against a military solution in Najaf, stressing that the grievances of supporters of the Mehdi army need to be addressed. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Dr. Hussain al-Shahristani, a nuclear scientist, President of the Iraqi National Academy of Science and prominent leader of Iraq's Shias, called on Ambassador Negroponte on August 14.  3. (C) After initial introductions and pleasantries, the discussion turned to the situation in Najaf.  Dr. Shahristani said that he had been in Najaf previously, on a day of very heavy fighting.  He had wanted to see Muqtada al-Sadr in order to mediate.  Unfortunately, the fighting was too severe to enable Shahristani to go behind the military lines to meet with al-Sadr.  4.  (C) The major problem at this time, said Shahristani, is that al-Sadr has gained strength and he and his Jaysh Mehdi are being seen sympathetically by increasing numbers of Iraqis -Q in large part because of clumsy handling of the situation by the IIG and Coalition forces.  He is seen as an underdog and has received considerably more popular attention than he deserves. Shahristani believes that there can be no military solution to the al-Sadr problem and the way it has been handled thus far is not in the best interests of the country.  Moreover, poor handling of al-Sadr in the media Q- statements insulting him, particularly by the Prime Minister and others -- has only aggravated the problem. It should be understood, said Shahristani, that the great majority of al-Sadr's supporters are very poor, deprived people, mostly Shia, who have gained nothing since Saddam's fall.  He also said that many of al-Sadr's supporters bear deep resentment for generations of poverty, deprivation and exclusion.  Their living conditions remain terrible. (In some areas of Sadr City, he noted, children have to walk through sewage to get to school.)  Their anger now has resulted from a sense that they are still excluded, even from the political process, and al-Sadr has taken advantage of that.  But al-Sadr and his supporters have also been able to gain sympathy among many Sunnis.  5.  (C )Ambassador pointed out that some of the sense that nothing has changed is due to the lack of visibility of some of the improvements.  Few people can see or appreciate what has been done to provide for the flow of oil and the generation of more electricity, for example. Shahristani acknowledged that, but said that much more that is visible could be done.  An example of a program that had both visibility and tangible gains was a privately-funded "Work-for-Food" project in Karbala that, he said, was highly successful.  It had a budget of USD 10,000, there was a program which employed about 450 men cleaning streets and individuals were paid with food baskets.  6. (C) There was a time last year, Shahristani said, when he believes al-Sadr was willing to join in the political process, but he was pushed aside Q- particularly by educated Iraqis who had spent years in exile.  At times, al-Sadr has been receptive to joining in the political process; at this time he is not Q- and this would not be a good time to speak to him as he sees political gain in confrontation.  7.  (C ) Shahristani does not believe that al-Sadr wants an Islamic state.  What he believes al-Sadr wants is respectability and, indeed, a share of power.  Al-Sadr has been able to successfully tap the long-standing desire on the part of many Shia for recognition and has gained the support of large numbers of people who have been marginalized and poor for generations -- descendants of laborers who had been the feudal poor and feel they have nothing to lose.  8.  (C ) Ambassador commented that it would be strange to suggest that Sadr has a right to hold the city of Najaf. The Government's response to try to assert control over Najaf looks reasonable.  Shahristani agreed, saying that the Mehdi Army should disarm and retire from the city. He believes, however, that it is important to distinguish between the Mehdi insurgents and those, particularly in the Sunni triangle, who continue to hope for a resurrection of the Saddam regime.  What he considers the poor handling of al-Sadr and the Mehdi Army, particularly by a number of those in the IIG, has only intensified the situation and created more tensions.  The fighting in Najaf, he believes, was avoidable.  It has cost the Government much-needed support and led al-Sadr to take less rational positions.  Shahristani asked the Ambassador to use his influence to caution the IIG, believing that the U.S. has an important role to play, as does the United Nations.  9.  (C) Shahristani does not consider Muqtada al-Sadr either helpful or admirable.  Neither does he see him as a serious religious leader.  However, he believes that the way to deal with al-Sadr is for him to be drawn into the political process rather than be forced into a confrontation.  More importantly, the poor, downtrodden, mostly Shia supporters of al-Sadr need to be given reason to feel that their circumstances are improving and that they have a stake in the new Government.  10. (C) COMMENT:  Shahristani spoke quietly but earnestly about the grim situation confronting the Shia urban poor. He is a man of considerable integrity and is both dedicated to democratic values and the betterment of Iraq overall.  As a leader of the Shia community and close to Grand Ayatollah Sistani, his views can also be said to be the voice of Shia moderation.   That said, already by the evening of August 12, Iraqi Government National Security Advisor Rubaie was in Najaf trying to negotiate with Sadr.  Had Shahristani actually reached Sadr, a confused negotiating situation might have grown even more confused.   NEGROPONTE 
UNCLAS BAGHDAD 000556   E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: KPAO, PGOV, PREF, KCUL, IZ SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR OPENS FIRST AMERICAN CORNER IN IRAQ  1.  Summary.  The Ambassador and Kurdistan Regional Government Minister of Culture Fatah Zakhoy opened the first American Corner in Iraq on August 8.  The Corner, located in the public library in Sulaimaniya, enables visitors to learn about the United States and to participate in American educational and cultural programming.  End summary.  2.  The new American Corner is the first such facility in the country and is the largest cultural donation by the Embassy in northern Iraq to date.  The Corner is located on the ground floor of the newly-built public library in Sulaimaniya, in northeastern Iraq.  The Corner includes over USD 85,000 in books, furniture, and equipment donated by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad with the support of NEA/PD and Embassy Amman.  3.  At the ribbon-cutting event the Ambassador told the audience that activities at the Corner "will broaden your perspective, deepen your knowledge, stimulate your imagination, and enrich your experience."  Minister Zakhoy welcomed the opening of the Corner and invited residents to use it to learn more about the United States.  Media coverage of the event included all local television channels and print publications.  All coverage was positive.  4.  The Corner is staffed by English-speaking employees and includes hundreds of volumes about the United States, a video and DVD library, three high-speed Internet-connected computers, and videoconferencing capabilities.  Plans are already underway to connect university professors from the United States with professors and students at Sulaimaniya University through videoconferencing.  5.  The Sulaimaniya Public Library recently opened to the public and currently has approximately 60,000 volumes.  In addition to the Internet machines at the Corner, it boasts the largest high- speed Internet access point in northern Iraq with over 75 workstations (25 of which were purchased through CPA.)

The American Corner is the largest cultural donation by the USG in northern Iraq, a fact not lost on Sulaimaniya's political leaders.  The leaders see the Corner as a USG statement about the relative safety of the KRG compared to the rest of the country.  The PAO has visited the Corner and during that visit noted that the Public Affairs section in Baghdad is committed to providing programming and staff training.

S E C R E T  BAGHDAD 000586  STATE FOR NEA/I, PM DAS LIKENS, PMAT  E.O. 12958:  DECL: 08/20/14 TAGS:  MOPS, PGOV, PTER, PREL, IZ, IR SUBJECT: SECURITY IN SADR CITY AND BAGHDAD:  PROGRESS IS SLOW  Ref:  Baghdad 0320  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERT FORD FOR REASONS 1.4 (A) (B) AND (D).  1.  (S) SUMMARY. In the past, cooperation between U.S. military units operating in Baghdad -- especially in Sadr City -- and Iraqi police has been problematic.  Indeed, the police chief in Sadr City on occasion has been positively unhelpful, if not hostile.  Local U.S. military commanders have been trying to gain more cooperation by engaging Deputy Minister of Interior Hekmat Musa Salman, Baghdad Iraqi Police Chief Abdul Rasaq and Baghdad Governor Ali Rahdi al-Haidary.  It remains to be seen whether these efforts will bear fruit.  Initial results from the past week of fighting in Sadr City suggest that the Iraqi police there have not yet turned the corner.  Notably, that unhelpful police chief in Sadr City is hanging onto his job despite promises that he would be removed.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------- IRAQI POLICE LEADERSHIP FAILURES --------------------------------  2.  (S) During the negotiations for the Sadr City Security Agreement outlined in reftel, Colonel Maaruf (Sadr City District Iraqi Police Chief) was one of the principal obstacles in moving forward and he openly refused to support the signing.  Sadr City District Council members, to include Ali Saudy and Kudair Alami, pointed to Colonel Maaruf as the source of IP intimidation of local political leaders.  Most recently, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) approved a local curfew in Sadr City beginning on August 5 to minimize civilian casualties/interference with security operations.  Initially, the Ministry chose to use the IP as the principal means of disseminating this information.  An MOI follow-up of the curfew notification revealed that Colonel Maaruf had ordered his stations to stand down during the recent fighting, which prevented the message from reaching most of the public.  On August 7, the downing of a U.S. helicopter occurred near a Sadr City IP station. U.S. soldiers observed Colonel Maaruf leading several IP units in celebratory fire at the time of the helicopter downing.  When the IP station was engaged by JAM members shortly after this incident, Colonel Maaruf ordered his forces to take refuge in the station and not assist U.S. military units in suppressing the JAM gunfire.  To underscore the level of collaboration, Chief Rasaq advised PolOffs that Colonel Maaruf established a truce with JAM that is now in effect.  ----------------------------- AGREEMENT ON MORE COOPERATION -----------------------------  3.  (S) Deputy Interior Minister Hekmat and IP Chief Rasaq have argued that the IP units in the field are sorely outgunned, ill-equipped and poorly trained, while local U.S. military commanders have pressed for a greater supporting role for the local police in combat operations. Following a series of discussions, Deputy Minister Hekmat and Police Chief Rasaq agreed to remove Colonel Maaruf from office and provide a suitable replacement for him supported by Ayatollah Sistani.  In addition, Deputy Minister Hekmat called for increased, aggressive sweeps by 1st CAV and the Iraqi Police of Sadr City to clear out the JAM.  Chief Rasaq pointed out that the National Conference posed a significant target for JAM forces in the area; urgent action was needed.  Deputy Minister Hekmat proposed that such operations should involve cordoning off Sadr City, to include the establishment of checkpoints on all seven bridges leading into this district.  ---------------------- PROMISES SO FAR NOT KEPT ------------------------  4.  (C) In the end, however, the Iraqi Police response in Sadr City was minimal.  They manned checkpoints at some access points to the district.  They did not actively participate in any of the 1st CAV clearing operations, despite the promises and urgings from the Deputy Interior Minister and the Iraqi Police Chief.  ------- COMMENT -------  5.  (S) We want a greater Iraqi security role in Sadr City in order to help promote the legitimacy of Iraqi Government entities with Sadr City residents.  Promises from the August 11 meeting notwithstanding, the actual conduct of operations in Sadr City have been carried out with U.S. forces and without much help from local police forces. Moreover, Colonel Maaruf still has his job despite promises from the Ministry of Interior to remove him.  This is in light of new reports of (unspecified) foreign fighters, the introduction of more sophisticated weapons -- to include surface-to-air missiles -- and daylight attacks on U.S. tanks.  This suggests a new vigor in the tempo of JAM operations in Baghdad.  If such reports prove true, it will be even harder for Coalition Forces to reestablish durable security in Sadr City without real cooperation and coordination from the Iraqi security forces.

(S) SUMMARY: Najaf's Governor, the Provincial Council Chair and the Governor's aide all believe Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani's intervention in the Najaf crisis has left al- Sadr significantly weakened politically.  They further feel that the agreement al-Sadr signed has strengthened the Iraqi Government's ability to move against al-Sadr if the Mahdi Militia takes up arms once again.  Council Chair Shayk Fayed Kazem al-Shamri also shared an interesting analysis of the political make up of the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement and the role that certain Iranian interests may play in supporting it.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------------- AL-SADR AND THE JAM'S POLITICAL FUTURE --------------------------------------  2. (S) Provincial Council Chair Shayk Fa'ad said the recent developments would finish al-Sadr politically and most likely lead to a further splintering of the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement.  According to Fa'ad, the Jaysh Al-Mahdi is split into three camps: moderates, led by clerics such as Ali Sismesom, extremists, led by the likes of Qais al-Khza'ali, and a third group led by ex-Mukhabarat officers from the former regime.  While moderates within the movement would probably try and join the Dawa party (NOTE: Fa'ad is a Dawa member.  END NOTE), Dawa is unlikely to accept them because the group as a whole is tainted by the extremists and ex- regime members.  Fa'ad also noted that it traditionally takes years of affiliation, often as much as ten, before an individual will be accepted into Dawa's full membership, let alone leadership.  The reasons for this are historical and ideological.  Dawa withheld full admission for long periods of time as a defense against infiltration from Saddam's security and intelligence services.  These long waiting periods have led to an organization that is politically homogenous.  The Dawa leadership is unlikely to accept vocal and active new members whose ideas may differ from those of the established leadership.  Fa'ad speculated that some elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi might be absorbed into the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).  3. (S) While it is not uncommon for a Najafi Dawa party member to label all things evil as being somehow influenced by SCIRI, Fa'ad actually elaborated on his reasoning. Fa'ad explained that when SCIRI first rose to prominence after liberation, there was a schism in the party, and within its Badr Corps, over how closely the party should remain aligned to Iran.  Prominent clerics like Mohammed Bakir al-Hakim sought to maintain a healthy distance from Iran. Other members, including Badr Corps commanders such as Mahdi Muhandis, wanted to have closer ties with Iran. Fa'ad alleged that individuals like Muhandis had made early overtures to the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement and may now look to absorb these erstwhile allies, and by extension the resources of their Iranian backers, into SCIRI.  --------------------------------- MONOLITHIC IRANIAN AGENDA A MYTH? ---------------------------------  4. (S) The Jasyh al-Mahdi, Fa'ad said, receive Iranian support.  But, he stressed, there are actually three groups in Iran that act with different agendas.  These groups are the Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian Intelligence Service, and President Khatami's administration.  These three groups, Fa'ad said, are all afraid of each other and are constantly jockeying for advantage.  This maneuvering includes backing different players in Iraq, with the Jaysh al-Mahdi receiving support from the Revolutionary Guards.  -------------------------- WHO FORCED SISTANI'S HAND? --------------------------  5. (S) Fa'ad seemed as surprised as everyone that Sistani had made the sudden, unannounced return to Najaf.  Fa'ad agrees with the conventional wisdom that Sistani is by nature a politically timid man who will not take action unless forced to do so.  He noted that none of the proposals outlined by Sistani in Basra on August 26 and agreed to by al-Sadr was new, having been spelled out by various players over the last several months.  Fa'ad told us he had personally visited four times with Sistani's son, beginning on April 7, to request that Sistani announce these proposals with an aim towards disbanding and disarming the al-Mahdi Militia.  Fa'ad was very curious to know what, or specifically who, had prompted Sistani to move so suddenly.  ------------ TALAL BILAL: ------------  6. (S) Talal Bilal, the Governor's aide and close friend, shared Fa'ad's assessment that al-Sadr is finished politically.  Talal, who was present at the discussion site, said that al-Sadr arrived at the meeting, held in a house owned by a Hawza member, accompanied by a single aide who served as bodyguard and driver.  When asked if al-Sadr would take up arms again, Talal pointed to a copy of the signed agreement between al-Sadr and Sistani.  Talal said that if al-Sadr does violate the agreement, he would be pitting himself against the entire Shia world, which, Talal intimated, would react strongly to the transgression. Governor Zurufi shares Talal's assessment that al-Sadr is finished politically.  The Governor also agrees that if al- Sadr violates the points of the proposal that the government will be on much firmer ground to move against him.  ------- COMMENT -------  7. (S) All three men agree that al-Sadr is finished politically.  They also believe his ability to cause trouble with his militia has been severely undercut. Embassy, however, advises caution in accepting their second premise.  Al-Sadr does not enjoy being without influence. His political marginalization may actually increase the chance he will once again stir up trouble with his militia. Embassy notes that al-Sadr has escaped with his skin twice. Much will hinge on whether Prime Minister Allawi carries out his intent to have the legal action against al-Sadr continue.  Furthermore, Embassy does not see evidence that the al-Mahdi Militia will be easily or completely disarmed. Reports as of August 27, including visual confirmation by predator drone, reveal that the al-Mahdi Militia are sneaking weapons from the shrine area.  Finally, it can not be said conclusively that those fighters who make up the majority of the Jasyh al-Mahdi's base, mostly unemployed and uneducated young men, will feel constrained by Sistani's opinion.  8. (S) That said, al-Sadr is now deprived of his primary trump card--the holy mosques with their religious significance and "citadel" character that made it difficult to use coalition forces to expel the al-Mahdi militia.  He has suffered grievous losses among some of his better fighting units and was clearly maneuvered into a difficult position by the impromptu alliance of secular Shi'a PM Allawi and religious Shi'a leader Sistani.  If the agreement holds this will have significance throughout Shi'a Iraq and beyond.  END COMMENT.   NNNN 
S E C R E T BAGHDAD 000963   E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/14  TAGS: KJUS, PREL, PTER, PHUM, KISL, IZ SUBJECT: IIG SUGGESTS IRAQI GUARDS FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN  Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission James Jeffrey for Reason 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S) SUMMARY.  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham Salih has suggested introducing Iraqi personnel to the inner circle of guards watching over Saddam Hussein.  The DPM proposed the switch in security personnel in the context of his broader expressed interest in destabilizing the temperament of the former Iraqi leader prior to trial. Deputy Commanding General for Detainee Operations Major General Geoffrey Miller expressed skepticism privately as to the advisability of this approach.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (S) At a September 13 meeting attended by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham Salih, Deputy Commanding General for Detainee Operations Major General Geoffrey Miller, Greg Kehoe of the Regime Crimes Liaison Office, and PolMilOff, DPM Salih noted that current MultiNational Force-Iraq (MNF- I) detention practices pertaining to Saddam Hussein were designed to "keep [Hussein] in a stable condition," and expressed his concern that keeping Saddam "too stable" was "not a good idea."  3.  (S) The DPM noted that, when he visited Saddam in his prison cell at Camp Cropper the previous week, Saddam appeared to react with anger to the presence of Iraqis in the prison and that, "from his hands," one could see that Saddam was "controlling himself in rage."  The DPM said that he and Prime Minister Allawi agreed that changing Saddam's inner circle of guards (presently staffed by MNF- I) to an all-Iraqi guard might provoke a useful reaction from Saddam and proposed that he identify ten "highly professional" Iraqi candidates for these positions.  4.  (S) MG Miller said he thought MNF-I and the IIG "could do this" and agreed that selecting "the right kind" of guards would, in this instance, be crucial.  He pointed out that Saddam was a "frustrating" person with whom to deal, being a "very angry" and "fragile" man, and that any guard force, MNF-I or Iraqi, should follow current procedures regarding regular duty rotations and a no-weapons policy for the innermost circle of guards.  5.  (S) The DPM also expressed the opinion that Saddam should be brought to trial in a prison uniform or jumpsuit. When it was noted that it is usual practice in Iraqi courts for defendants to appear in dress suits, usually brought to jailed defendants by their families prior to trial, the DPM conceded the point and agreed that standard procedure should be followed.  6.  (S) MG Miller remarked that, based on prior experience, the application of handcuffs on the day of the trial was in itself likely to destabilize Saddam.  He also stated that it was important that the court scene "appear professional" and stressed that, contrary to the DPM's concerns, he believed it would be difficult to prevent Saddam from becoming "too agitated" as his trial date approached.  7.  (S) After the meeting, MG Miller privately expressed the opinion that MNF-I and IIG strategy should instead focus on maintaining Saddam at maximum mental stability for trial.  He agreed that some Iraqi participation in guard duty was possible but suggested that this would be better introduced on a more limited level, perhaps with one Iraqi guard paired with an MNF-I guard in two-man teams.  No additional visits by IIG officials to Saddam in prison are scheduled until after Saddam's expected recovery from upcoming hernia surgery in October, which will be performed at Ibn Sina hospital inside the International Zone on September 17.

FORD FOR REASON 1.4 (D).  1. (C) Summary: We have met twice in the past two weeks with Shia cleric Saayid Ayad Jamal Ad-Din who warns that the forces of ideological and religious extremism will dominate the new National Assembly without Coalition support to educated moderates and liberals such as himself.  He claimed that despite his own personal plea to join with moderates, many representatives to Muqtada Al-Sadr have now sided with the United Iraqi Alliance and some 25 members are now on this list tipping the balance even more for extreme elements of the Shia community.  While this cleric says religious parties won't fare well in the Shia heartland, he himself seems more interested in meeting Iraqi communities located in Britain and the U.S.  This is especially odd as he has personal stature as a cleric and descendent of the prophet that would enable him to raise the delicate issue of separating religion and politics in a way that other liberal politicians cannot.  End summary.  2. (C) Saayid Ayad shared with PolOff on December 21 his concern that Iranian intervention is affecting Iraqi internal issues. He suggested that Iran is backing major parties like Da'wa and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), providing millions of dollars for media coverage and public influence.  Ayad said he had received an invitation to go to Iran to meet with Iranian leaders, but after seeing some of his interviews on Al-Arabiyya TV attacking Ali Khamanei, the Iranians withdrew their offer.  Ayad went on to say that he has spent many years overseas arguing for a secular Iraq.  While recognizing the sanctity of Islamic beliefs, he felt those beliefs should be kept in the private realm, separate from politics.  Ayad said he hopes that with additional support, he can convey this message to the Iraqi public who he believes would welcome this with open arms.  3. (C) Ayad told PolOff that he has joined Iraqi National Congress member Saad Saleh Jabor's Nation's Party list which has 67 names running for the National Assembly and about 17 names for the Provincial Council in Karbala.  Their hope is to capture a maximum of 50 seats and no less than 20.  According to Ayad, the party is highly dependent on the overseas vote, as many of its party members live in exile.  Ayad hopes to appeal to overseas Iraqis who want to see a new, democratic Iraq similar to the western, largely democratic countries they are now living in.  4. (C) According to Ayad, the United Iraqi Alliance list was headed towards a significant disappointment in the elections until they agreed to allow Muqtada Al-Sadr representatives to join the list.  Ayad believes that this decision was approved by Ayatollah Sistani himself to bolster the list's popularity among younger, less educated people.  Ayad explained that most of the 25 names associated with Muqtada's following are relative unknowns.  Of these 25 names in the list, he said three are in the first ten and ten names are in the first fifty.  Ayad claims he obtained this information from a trusted go-between working with Muqtada Al-Sadr's camp and Mohammed Reda Al-Sistani's office.  To counter this effort, Ayad said he tried to recruit several Muqtada followers to the Nation's Party, including spokesperson Ali Semaysom.  Semaysom reportedly turned down the offer stating that he is not permitted to participate as a religious figure himself.  5. (C) Comment: It is interesting to hear a cleric like Ayad explain how he has attempted to lure radicals like Ali Semaysom to his party with the intent of reducing the overall influence of religion in politics.  While he insists that religious parties will not fare well in the Shia heartland (he comes from Najaf himself), we have no indication he has gone to southern Iraq to campaign.  Instead, he told us on December 30 that he wants to meet Iraqi communities in Britain and the U.S.  In a separate conversation December 30, Jamal Udeen stressed to us that the United Iraqi Alliance list will promote religious involvement in laws relating to personal and communal conduct as well as national politics.  He alleged there is more than financial support binding Iran to the religious parties featured on the Alliance candidate list.  Jamal Udeen, in some ways, would be the ideal liberal politician to raise the delicate issue of separating religion from politics.  As a cleric and "sayyed" - a descendent of the prophet Mohammed - it would be harder for Islamists to criticize him as irreligious.  End summary.  6. (U) Minimize considered.  NEGROPONTE

JEFFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Iraqi Interim Government Foreign Minster Zibari told Deputy Secretary Armitage on December 31 that Iraq's Arab neighbors need to worry less about what the Shi'a will do in Iraq after elections and think about how to help convince Iraq's Sunni Arabs to stop tearing the country apart.  Zibari was firm that Iraqi and Kurdish interests require the January elections to go forward despite the likelihood of low Sunni voter turnout.  Zibari said that more American pressure should be applied to Syria, which is still giving too much freedom to former regime elements.  Zibari asserted that the Turks exaggerate the Kurdish issue but he said that Iraq would send a high- level delegation to Ankara to discuss the PKK.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Foreign Minister Zibari received Deputy Secretary Armitage, Charge d'Affaires Jeffrey, Assistant Secretary Burns, D staff aide Ryu and Embassy Pol note-taker on the evening of December 31 at the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) headquarters in the International Zone.  (The Foreign Minister was unaccompanied except for his security.) Zibari was upbeat, back from what he felt was a good trip to China.  He stressed Iraqi appreciation for the American administration's commitment, praising in particular American staying power.  ------------------------------------------- IRAQ'S ARAB NEIGHBORS WORRY ABOUT THE SHI'A -------------------------------------------  3. (C) Zibari stressed that Iraq's Arab neighbors are nervous about Iraq's way forward.  They perceive the Shi'a coming to power and the Sunni Arabs about to be shut out of government and the constitution-drafting process.  Zibari said that he has explained to the Arab neighbors that Iraq will remain an Arab League member and respect its obligations.  He has also underlined to them, however, that the future Iraqi government will be very different from the Saddam regime marked by pan-Arab rhetoric.  4. (C) Zibari said he underlined in Dubai in early December that Iraq's Shi'a and Kurds want to work with all Iraqis to prepare a good constitution.  Many of Iraq's neighbors believe the rhetoric of former regime supporters who say that they stand for Iraq's national unity.  In reality, he asserted, it is the Sunni Arabs whose rejectionist stance is tearing Iraq apart.  5. (C) Zibari said that the January 6 meeting in Jordan of neighboring states would help them understand the Iraqi elections.  He noted, for example, that even Jordanian Foreign Minister Mulki did not understand how minorities, such as Iraq's Sunni Arabs, benefit from the Transitional Administrative Law's (TAL) provision that 2/3 of the voters in any three of Iraq's governorates could block the new constitution.  (COMMENT: Prior to the meeting, Zibari told PolCouns that he was not sure either Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi or Syrian Foreign Minister Shara would attend.  He thought King Abdallah's remarks about Iran might keep the Iranians away.  END COMMENT)  -------------------------- SYRIA: NEEDS MORE PRESSURE --------------------------  6. (C) Zibari told the Deputy Secretary that charges of Syrian complicity in Iraq's security problems from officials like Iraqi Defense Minister Sha'lan add to Syrian concerns.  Zibari perceived that overall, however, the Syrians think the U.S. lacks staying power in Iraq, just as it lacked it in Lebanon 20 years ago.  Syria aims to be an arbiter of Iraqi affairs, he claimed.  Thus, it provides far broader freedom to former regime elements in terms of money transfers, training and media access than it ever granted to the anti-Saddam opposition before.  He urged greater U.S. pressure on Damascus.  For example, he suggested the U.S. begin helping the Syrian opposition, a step he claimed would immediately gain Syrian Government attention and modify its behavior.   ---------------------------------------- TURKEY: DO NOT EXAGGERATE KURDISH ISSUES ----------------------------------------  7. (C) Zibari said that bilateral relations with Turkey are "going well," although he acknowledged ongoing Turkish worries about Kurdish independence.  Zibari stressed that the Turks ultimately understand that independence is not on the agenda of the Iraqi Kurds' leadership.  Occasional developments do "agitate" the Turks, such as the referendum on Kurdish independence.  Zibari also acknowledged Turkish concerns about Kirkuk.  Keeping the current provincial council would help allay those Turkish worries as there are Turkmen sitting on the council, a fact that reassures the Turks.  8. (C) Zibari asserted that the PKK is largely shutdown and that the Turkish-Iraq border has been quiet in recent years.  He acknowledged that there have been some incidents but he said the Turks should not exaggerate their importance.  He added that the Turkish Government has intelligence operatives and Special Forces in northern Iraq and understands the reality on the ground.  Zibari stated that the Interim Iraqi Government policy is clear; Iraq will not harbor any terror group on its soil.  Zibari said an interagency Iraqi team will go to Ankara in January to discuss the PKK.  That said, he said the Turkish Government must understand that the Iraqi Government's biggest priority now is not the PKK.  -------------------------------- KURDS MUST SUPPORT THE ELECTIONS --------------------------------  9. (C) Zibari, who is close to Kurdish KDP leader Masud Barzani, dismissed the Kurdish threat to boycott the January elections because of Kurdish dissatisfaction with the situation in Kirkuk.  Kurds should not let themselves be seen as obstacle, he opined.  Moreover, such a boycott would hurt the credibility of the elections and hurt the Kurds' friends in the U.S.  The suggestion put forward of keeping a provincial council along the lines of the current council is not a permanent solution, but it puts the issue off past elections.  Zibari concluded that the January elections may be messy at times, but they must go forward. Deputy Secretary agreed, noting that the U.S. and Iraq have started down a path.  Too many Iraqi lives have been sacrificed to change that path now.  The U.S., he strongly reiterated to Zibari, will not change its stance on elections.  ----------------------------- INTERNATIONAL MONITORS USEFUL -----------------------------  10. (C) Zibari opined that the Shi'a United Alliance list is strong but he doubted that it would gain 60-65 percent of the vote as many think.  Zibari anticipated there would be a strong Kurdish turnout.  Looking at the Sunni Arab vote, Zibari stated that the Sunnis want to vote; however, he anticipated that the voter turnout would not be large because of the intimidation campaign.  In addition, none of the lists had garnered much Sunni Arab enthusiasm.  The resulting Sunni Arab apathy would keep many voters home in the face of the risk associated with voting.  Zibari said that, while the Sunni Arab vote would be low, the rest of Iraqis would vote in big numbers.  It would be useful to have international monitors in Iraq to see how open the process is and how good the turnout will be.  11. (U) Minimize considered.   NEGROPONTE

FORD FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Baghdad Provincial Governor Ali Radhi al- Haidary was assassinated on January 4, in the eighth attempt on his life since he assumed office in June, 2004. Assailants in three vehicles attacked the Governor's motorcade after he left his office in Baghdad's Mansour District.  He was seriously wounded in the ensuing gun battle, and died shortly afterward at a local hospital. This most recent attack underlines the heightened state of insecurity in the capital, and reaffirms to all officials the real nature of their vulnerability.  It comes as some political party leaders are stating an unwillingness to campaign in large portions of Baghdad for fear of violence, and as the Baghdad Provincial Council, which elected al- Haidary Governor last summer, has not met for two weeks due to threats.  Baghdad's Regional Council, which covers the Province's rural areas, was scheduled to elect a new Deputy Governor on January 5, to replace Deputy Governor Hatem Kamil, who was killed in a similar ambush-style attack in November 2004.  Should this election proceed as planned, according to the Provincial Charter passed by the Councils in July, 2004, the new Deputy Governor would become acting Governor of Baghdad.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------------ DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT ------------------------  2. (U) Ali Radhi al-Haidary, an engineer by profession, began his local government career in May 2003 when he attended a neighborhood caucus organized by the Baghdad Mayoralty and the Coalition.  During this caucus fellow citizens to the Adil Neighborhood Council elected him.  The Neighborhood Council subsequently elected him to the Mansour District Council, and the District Council voted to send him to the City Council.  Al-Haidary served as Chairman of the City Council from December 2003 to February 2004.  During his tenure, he extended the Council's staff and led a Baghdad delegation to Japan, where they met with Prime Minister Koizumi.  3. (U) Al-Haidary was a leading candidate for Mayor of Baghdad in the selection held in April 2004, garnering support from both Shi'a and Sunni City Council members. However, he dramatically withdrew at the last moment, and subsequently campaigned for and was elected by the Provincial Council to be Governor in June 2004.  As Governor he focused on finding funding and facilities for the provincial government and building up its nascent administrative system in the face of the insurgency and extensive lawlessness gripping the province.  4. (U) Al-Haidary was a 48-year-old Shi'a Arab.  He held a BA in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA.  He was director of the al-Timsaah (Alligator) Paint Company from 1983 to 2003, and was selected in September 2003 by the new Minister of Education to be a special advisor on financial and management issues.  In addition to his residence in the Mansour district, he had a small farm on the outskirts of Baghdad, where he three times won Baghdad Province prizes for best crops.  He is survived by a wife and two children.  ------------------------------- A FREQUENT ASSASSINATION TARGET -------------------------------  5. (C) Al-Haidary had been attacked seven times in the seven months that he was Governor.  Two Iraqi police officers were killed in these attacks and several security guards were wounded.  His first armored car was destroyed by an IED.  In a conversation with Embassy staff on January 3, the day before his death, the Governor remarked that out of concern for his family, if he were attacked again, he would "leave the country and never look back".  6. (C) On January 4, according to initial Iraqi Police Service (IPS) reports, three AIF vehicles ambushed the Governor's three-car convoy when it left his office in West Baghdad's Mansour District.  Two blocked the path of the lead vehicle, an unarmored BMW in which he was traveling (NOTE: This is unusual, as the U.S. Army First Cavalry Division rents an armored BMW for the Governor's use, and principals rarely ride in the lead vehicle.  The Governor may have been trying to throw off his potential assassins. However, in earlier assassinations (see below) the attackers seemed to know to stage their attack when the principal was atypically riding in an unarmored car.  END NOTE) The AIF vehicles began firing on the lead vehicle, while a third car pulled along side and engaged the two follow cars, SUVs.  The Governor's personal security detail (PSD) returned fire and a gun battle ensued.  Reportedly the Governor was rushed to nearby Yarmouk Hospital, where he died of his wounds at approximately 1030 local time.  -------------------------------------- IIG MIXED MESSAGES ON SECURITY SUPPORT --------------------------------------  7. (C) Post had sought suitable housing for the Governor in the Green Zone/International Zone since CPA days.  While the Governor had briefly used two rooms at the al-Rasheed Hotel, his family faced difficulties in accessing the zone, and he chose to remain with them at his residence in the Adil neighborhood.  After months of urging, the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) finally recognized the need to address the Governor's safety concerns.  On December 27, Interim Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham Salih and the Interim Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Zuhair signed a letter authorizing the Governor to use a private home in the International Zone.  Governor al-Haidary told PolOff on December 30, however, that when he attempted to take possession of the house Ministry of Defense (MoD) Inspector General Layla Jassim rebuffed him and approximately 60 armed Iraqi National Guardsmen (ING).  He said the MoD IG claimed ownership of the property and tore the DPM's letter to shreds.  The Governor told PolOff that he left after being physically threatened by the IG and ING.  ---------------------- FINDING A NEW GOVERNOR ----------------------  8. (C) The Baghdad Regional Council, which represents the areas of the province outside the city limits, is slated to meet on January 5 to elect a new Deputy Governor.  The former Deputy, Hatem Kamal, also a close CPA and Embassy contact, was assassinated in a November 2004 vehicular ambush similar to the attack on Governor al-Haidary.  The Regional Council leadership has advised EmbOffs for several months that they are concerned for their own safety.  They have been meeting at various locations that remain unannounced until immediately beforehand.  If the Regional Council leadership decides to go ahead with their January 5 meeting despite al-Haidary's assassination, and if they both have a quorum and elect a new Deputy Governor as scheduled, then the new Deputy Governor they choose would serve as acting Governor of Baghdad Province.  If this does not occur, then the Provincial Council (which covers the whole province) might elect an interim Governor to serve on an emergency basis until after the January 30 elections. (NOTE: In accordance with the Charters adopted by the Baghdad Councils in June 2004, the councils at all levels utilize competitive, transparent search procedures to fill executive positions; it would normally take 4-6 weeks for the public announcement, search committee work, and selection meetings for the Provincial Council to choose a new, permanent governor.  With elections in less then a month there is not sufficient time to do that.  END NOTE)  ----------------------- WIDENING CIRCLE OF FEAR -----------------------  9. (C) Executive branch officials like Kamil and al-Haidary are only the most prominent Baghdad provincial leaders at risk in an intensifying terrorist campaign.  In response to explicit threats and continuing attacks, the members of the Baghdad Provincial Council have chosen to cancel their meetings for the last two weeks.  The Chairman of the Provincial council told PolOff on January 4 that he is being surveilled and is taking precautions by shifting his residence periodically.  The Chairman is also a representative of the Baghdad Independent Citizens' Gathering, a newly formed party mostly composed of council members.  He said the group will not be able to campaign in Mansour, or in the southern district of Rasheed because of the threat level.  In the Governor's final conversation with Embassy FSN, he warned her to be careful; that the AIF is especially tracking all females working for the USG.  10. (C) COMMENT: Many Embassy employees and former CPA officials working in Baghdad had come to know and respect Governor al-Haidary as a colleague and friend.  His commitment to democracy, personal bravery and his practical approach to the difficult tasks ahead were an inspiration to many.  Al-Haidary's assassination follows the slaying not only of Deputy Governor Hatim, but also of Deputy Mayor Faris abd al-Razzak, three District Council Chairpersons and an estimated 26 Baghdad Council members at all levels over the past 14 months.  With elections less than a month away, the murder of Governor al-Haidary will further disturb an already terrorized local administration.  In conjunction with all the other attacks, it will have a further chilling effect on candidates and election workers. It demonstrates that even the most tenacious public official -- willing to withstand seven assassination attempts -- will eventually be killed by terrorists or driven away.  The Governor's killing appears to have been meant by the insurgents to demonstrate to the seven million citizens of Baghdad province that even the most heavily- protected local official is not safe, that the Coalition and the IIG cannot ensure security, and that anyone is within the insurgents' reach.  Although we have not seen a claim of responsibility for the Governor's assassination, the modus operandi of the killers was similar to that used to kill the Deputy Governor, whose murder was later claimed by the insurgent group Ansar al-Sunna.  END COMMENT.   NEGROPONTE

US CUSTOMS 131939Z APR 05      B. BAGHDAD 1562      C. BAGHDAD 1646  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a), (b) and (d)  1.  (C/REL TO UK AND AUS)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 2.  2.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  Action Request: Post asks that the Department of State request the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (Customs and Border Protection) to continue its  support of the Border Support Team mission in Iraq. Teams at Trebil, Waleed, Rabia and Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) are due to depart at the end of their ninety-day tours at varying dates in September.  Post asks that the Department request replacement teams and that they be deployed in time to allow for an overlap of at least one week at the border sites.  The same standard should be applied to subsequent replacements.  Post welcomes the DHS's offer to provide a Country Director in late July. End action request.  3.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  Border Support Teams (BSTs) deployed to Iraq by the DHS Customs and Border Protection agency are an essential ingredient in the execution of Iraq's strategy to reduce illegal traffic and to facilitate the flow of legal cross-border traffic.  BSTs are performing superbly at the three border ports of entry (POE) and at the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP).  One major result of their work is expedited trucking from Syria and Jordan, essential to the food distribution system in Iraq.  Although not quantifiable, the BSTs have also likely disrupted smuggling and the flow of foreign fighters.  While noticeable progress is already evident, numerous challenges remain, making their presence in Iraq a continuing requirement.  4.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  The Iraqi initiative to provide a unified POE command under a single officer with multi-ministerial authority is a new initiative, which followed considerable coalition encouragement.  The new POE Directors General are going to need mentoring and a period of staff development.  The BSTs represent the best means of delivering this expertise and support, making them fundamental to the success of the initiative.  5.  (C/- REL TO UK AND AUS)  Other challenges at the POEs will also require BST involvement for the foreseeable future.  BSTs have identified shortcomings in physical security and traffic flow that take time to eliminate, both for construction and for development of proper implementing procedures.  They have also identified challenges in organization and training of POE personnel.  While some of the solutions are fairly simple procedural matters, the BSTs have seen that the POE personnel revert to their previous inefficient and ineffective procedures when appropriate leadership is not available.  That leadership is often provided by the BST; developing the Iraqi leadership to perform the same function will take much time.  Some technological solutions (e.g., PISCES, Z-Back Scatter) being introduced will also require significant time to ensure effective operations and maintenance.  Rapid personnel turnover in the POEs -- probably a fact of life because of their remote locations and austere operating environs - - also means that solutions to problems depend on the long-term commitment of the BSTs.  Success at the POEs is further dependent on the development of complementary support capabilities being developed at the appropriate ministries, another long-term issue.  6.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  DHS has proposed a fairly robust Baghdad-based team that moves out to the POEs as required. If funding can be found, DHS's proposal may be an acceptable alternative in the mid-term future; but not until conditions for success have been established at least at the current locations.  Other POEs (e.g., ArAr, Um Qasr, Habur Gate) face challenges and may need BSTs of their own in the mid-term. Options for deploying teams to those POEs need to be retained.  7.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  Based on their employment experience, BST members have recommended changes to team composition and employment.  The addition of the promised DHS Country Director to the Mission Country Team will enhance the ability of the Mission to evaluate the performance of the BSTs and to make decisions about team composition and employment principles, as well as the need for subsequent replacements.  8.  (C/ REL TO UK AND AUS)  By having a positive effect on the legal traffic flow at the POEs, DHS Border Support Teams complement nicely the efforts of the Multi-National Force-Iraq to stop the illegal flow along other parts of the border.  DHS continued support of this important mission would be greatly appreciated.  9.  (U) REO BASRAH, REO HILLAH, REO MOSUL and REO KIRKUK minimize considered. Satterfield 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002107  SIPDIS  STATE PASS TO USAID, STATE PASS TO NEA-ROBERT SILVERMAN, STATE PASS TO EB-DAS LARRY GREENWOOD/TOM ENGLE, TREASURY PASS TO OLIN WETHINGTON  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2015 TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, IZ SUBJECT: DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER AZEZ'S LAST WORDS ON DISCUSSIONS WITH THE IMF, CBI, AND DEBT  Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR ANNE E. DERSE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)  1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Deputy Finance Minister Azez Hassan said Iraq's reporting on fiscal data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has improved significantly and is now strong.  MOF is ready to close the books on 2004 and Azez said he expects the Budget Department to finalize by the June 6 Article IV consultations the fiscal data for at least the first two months of 2005 and "probably" through the end of March.   He identified four key challenges to a successful Article IV discussion and eventual negotiation of a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in 2005: (1) Fuel subsidy reform; (2) Food subsidy reform; (3) Reform of state-owned enterprises; and (4) controlling inflation.  Based on his knowledge of the new cabinet members of the Iraq Transitional Government (ITG), Azez is not optimistic that the first three reforms are politically feasible.  Azez said inflation would actually be negatively impacted by the success of these reforms, especially with the Central Bank's lack of effective monetary policy tools.  Azez's main concern, however, is that with his forced resignation (septel) there is no one who can competently manage Iraq's relationship with the IMF. Azez also said he told new ITG Finance Minister Ali Allawi that former FinMin and current Vice President Adil Mahdi needs to be included in debt negotiations with Gulf creditors because he laid down the current base. It is our impression from a recent meeting with the Charge that Mahdi agrees with Azez. END SUMMARY.  ---------------------------------------- REPORTING ON 2004 AND FIRST QUARTER 2005 ----------------------------------------  2. (C) Deputy Finance Minister Azez Hassan told us on May 16 that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Budget Department was finally prepared to close the books on 2004 fiscal data. Azez said he worked closely with the IMF last month in Washington to identify gaps in the MOF's first data submission and his staff told him earlier in the day that the data is now complete.  In addition, Azez said he expects the Budget Department to finalize by the June 6 Article IV consultations in Bahrain the fiscal data for at least the first two months of 2005 and "probably" through the end of March.  One significant factor missing from the 2005 data is any information from the Kurdish Region. Prior to 2005, the MOF treated the Kurdish Region as a transferred expenditure from within MOF's budget.  Thus, the transfer of funds from the line item in the MOF budget to the Kurdish Region (Suleymaniyah and Irbil, which also covers Dohuk) was the only required reporting.  According to Azez, the Kurdish Region insisted the 2005 budget treat the Kurdish Region as two independent spending units just like all of the line ministries.  As a result, the Kurdish Region is now required to provide a detailed spending plan and report their expenditures and revenues just like every other line ministry.  Azez said MOF has yet to receive any information in 2005.  (Note: We later learned that officials from the Kurdish Region provided their detailed budget spending plan for 2005 to MOF on May 16, but they have yet to report any actual expenditure or revenue detail for 2004 or 2005. End Note.)  Azez agreed the Minister of Finance should contact Kurdish leaders Massoud Barzani (KRG Prime Minister) and Jalal Talabani (ITG President) in writing to formally request the required expenditure information.  ------------------------------------- SBA IS DEAD WITHOUT FUEL PRICE REFORM -------------------------------------  3. (SBU) Azez reiterated what we have heard from various sources, including the IMF, in that unless the ITG acts on fuel price reform there is no chance of an SBA.  Azez said the IMF expects ITG action on both the opening of the import market to the private sector and the raising of domestic, state-controlled prices for at least the two high-end petroleum products (high octane fuel and low-sulfur diesel). Azez said there are two views on how to raise prices: (1) one shot with some sort of compensation or (2) gradually without compensation.  Azez favors the gradual approach without compensation, which he said is the same approach favored by the IMF.  Azez said under the gradual approach, the goal would be to eliminate the subsidy within two to three years. (Note: Iraq's commitment to the IMF is to phase out the fuel price subsidy by 2009. End Note.)  4. (C) Azez confirmed the Cabinet and National Assembly would both have to approve any significant fuel price reform.  He is not optimistic about passing this reform in 2005 given the current make-up of the ITG Cabinet.  In particular, Azez is concerned about the new ITG Minister of Oil, Ibrahim Bahr Al-Uloum, who, according to Azez, was the main obstacle in the Iraq Governing Council that prevented the Coalition Provisional Authority from taking action on fuel price reform back in February 2004.  (Comment: In our initial discussion with Bahr Al-Uloum (septel), he recognized that the ITG will need to reform Iraq's fuel price subsidy system both for the benefit of the Iraqi budget and the negotiation of an SBA with the IMF, and the new Electricity Minister told us May 18 that Bahr Al-Ulooum supported the reform, as he does. Finance Minister Allawi and Planning Minister Barham Saleh are strongly in favor of significant reform.  Prime Minister al-Jafari's position remains tenuous.  End Comment.)  -------------------------------------------- NEED AT LEAST A PLAN FOR FOOD AND SOE REFORM --------------------------------------------  5. (C) Azez said he told Minister Allawi in a recent briefing on commitments to the IMF that the ITG must at least approve plans to address Iraq's food distribution system and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  Azez did not know whether the Privatization Commission established by former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi still exists under the new government. He was once again not optimistic about approval of either of these reforms since he does not think the new Cabinet will take the political risk.  ------------------------------ INFLATION AND THE CENTRAL BANK ------------------------------  6. (SBU) Azez explained that the proposed fuel, food, and SOE reforms would all have an inflationary effect on prices (liberalization of fuel prices, monetization of food basket, and privatization of SOEs).  The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) does not have any working tools to manage inflationary pressures, according to Azez.  Azez said the IMF will continue to look hard at inflation during the SBA negotiations.  7. (C) KPMG is currently in Iraq attempting to finalize the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) audit on the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). The Ministry of Finance has been working to identify discrepancies between the draft IAMB audit and the Ministry's figures.  Several of the figures used by KPMG in the audit are the same figures available to CBI from the Federal Reserve Bank in New York (FRBNY).  However, no one in the Central Bank, according to Azez, would certify the DFI balances presented by KPMG.  Azez said the "records of the Central Bank are a shame -- what is happening at the Central Bank is shameful".  He wasn't sure if the cause was incompetence or corruption.  In reference to the possibility of continuing to work on Iraq's debt negotiations as an advisor to CBI, Azez responded that that would be impossible; he "knows the inside((and) cannot stand the CBI."  8. (C) In the context of discussing the extent of his (former) responsibilities at MOF, Azez said the CBI recently tried "in a devious way" to bring US dollars (USD) to Iraq for the daily currency auction. The Minister learned of a request for a USD 3 billion cash transfer from the FRBNY to the CBI vault in Baghdad and called Azez for an explanation. Azez said he was unaware of the transaction. He said he immediately called Governor Shabibi to stop the transfer. Azez found out the following day, May 15, that the Ministry had requested a USD 2.3 billion cash transfer to the CBI vault and the CBI requested an additional USD 700 million cash transfer from the CBI's independent account in the FRBNY. MOF officials explained to Azez that the transfer was necessary to fund letters of credit (LCs) and to buy Iraqi Dinar (ID) from the CBI for normal government operations. Azez explained that he previously set up a system with the CBI by which MOF would order the CBI to pay LCs directly out of the DFI account in the FRBNY, rather than shipping cash to Iraq then back out again to fund the LC.  To fund normal government operations, MOF should tell the CBI how many ID are required and the CBI should provide them.  CBI would then simply transfer USD from the DFI account in the FRBNY to the CBI account in the FRBNY to pay for the ID.  MOF does not need to transfer USD into Iraq.  Rather, only CBI requires USD for the daily currency auction.  Azez said CBI "probably wanted to make MOF pay for the cost" of transporting the USD to Iraq.  ------------------------------ VP MAHDI AND DEBT NEGOTIATIONS ------------------------------  9. (C) Azez told us that he told Allawi he "needs to include" former FinMin and current Vice President Adil Mahdi in negotiations with Gulf creditors. Azez said when Allawi questions why, Azez said Mahdi "laid down the base." Everyone in the Cabinet needs to be included in these negotiations, according to Azez.  10. (C) VP Mahdi told the Charge in a May 12 meeting that negotiations with the Gulf creditors is a "political isse". He continued, "I don't think the Saudis want USD 800 million from us(they want contracts, assistance, etc."  Mahdi said the ITG still needed to "start" negotiations with the Gulf States. (Allawi also told us this week that the ITG has yet to begin to discuss a strategy on approaching Gulf creditors).  Mahdi was planning to meet with Allawi after Allawi returned from Brazil to "draw up a strategy."  Mahdi hoped the ITG would have a strategy by the end of the month (May). Mahdi suggested the ITG might use the Brussels Conference on June 22 as leverage to at least push for responses from Paris Club members to previous MOF letters requesting bilateral deals better than Paris Club terms.  "So far no positive responses((they are) all sticking with 80 percent."  Mahdi said the ITG would send a "good team" to Brussels, led by Foreign Minister Zebari and including FinMin Allawi and Deputy Prime Minister Rowsch Shaways. They plan to have "something to say on commercial and Gulf creditors," according to Mahdi.  He expects the ITG to have a "vision of all the claims" by the end of this year.  ------- COMMENT -------  11. (C) One day after submitting his resignation, Azez was noticeably more pessimistic about Iraq's progress on key reforms necessary for the negotiation of a SBA with the IMF, especially if he was not going to be involved in the process. Azez said the IMF's invitation to Allawi to participate in the Article IV consultations June 6-12 in Bahrain stated, "Azez must come," according to Azez. IMF (non)- resident representative Ibrahim Tigani called us after hearing of Azez's resignation to say the IMF is now considering what to do about the June 6 Article IV consultations.  He said the IMF will probably write to Allawi re-transmitting the questionnaire that must be completed for the meeting to go forward.  Without Azez in attendance, the ITG will need to impress upon the IMF during Article IV consultations that they are capable of providing the data and making the political decisions necessary to negotiate and fulfill the commitments associated with a SBA.

Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY. The recent transfer of the NGO Registry Office to the State Ministry of Civil Society Affairs, which has a Sadrist Minister, has raised concerns about the Ministry's role and the potential misuse of registry data for political purposes.  Both the Deputy Prime Minister and the new head of the State Minister for Civil Society Affairs assured EmbOffs that the NGO community would be allowed to operate freely in Iraq.  NGOs in Iraq will need to play a role in public awareness during the constitution-drafting process, but this small ministry appears ill equipped to facilitate that process.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- ------ NEW HOME AND SUPERVISOR FOR THE NGO REGISTRY OFFICE --------------------------------------------- ------  2.  (C/NF) On May 29, Dr. Bassim al-Rubaie, the newly designated head of the NGO Registry Office, told PolOff and IRMO Consultant that the Council of Ministers and the State Minister for Civil Society Affairs dismissed the previous office head, Dawod Pasha, due to his reported Ba'athist affiliations as well as his prior employment as a police officer in the Interior Ministry.  At about the same time, the Council of Ministers selected Dr. Al-Rubaie, an attorney with prior experience with NGOs, as the new head of the NGO Registry Office.  Al-Rubaie explained that the office, which had previously resided in the Planning Ministry, had finally moved to the State Ministry for Civil Society Affairs.  3.  (C/NF) Al-Rubaie explained that his office would initially provide training to NGOs in two specific areas: how to organize themselves as NGO's, and how two obtain both government and non-government funding. He hopes this could be accomplished through provincial NGO centers he plans to establish.  He also described a project to coordinate with "Iraqi business centers" to match potential donors from the business community with an NGO that can perform the desired task.  This concept, however, is still in the developmental stage. Eventually, he hopes that the NGO community can even augment the staff at the Baghdad-based NGO Registry Office.  ------------------------------------------ NEW STATE MINISTER AND PLANS FOR STATE/NGO RELATIONSHIP ------------------------------------------  4.  (C/NF) During a meeting the previous week, the new State Minister for Civil Society Affairs, Ala'a Habib Khadim, told EmbOffs that the move by the Registry Office back to his Ministry would correct the mistakes made by the previous government in handling the registry.  He explained that the registry would serve as the "core" of his ministry's work and, logically, belongs there.  Khadim said he anticipated logistics problems with the transfer, and hopes the U.S. will be able to assist him financially and technically. EmbOffs noted the separation between the NGO community and government in democratic countries, with the government role, if necessary, focused on advocacy and support and not/not control of NGO activities.  While Khadim acknowledged this distinction, he was still concerned over illegitimate NGOs used as insurgent fronts as well as fraudulent NGOs bilking funds from unwitting donors.  He also spoke of required monthly activity reports by NGOs as a means of control by his state ministry.  Emboffs expressed concern about this idea.  5.  (C/NF) Khadim, a Sadrist, looks forward to working with the NGO community with specific goals to provide funding, training, and coordination with NGOs.  To accomplish these goals, he intends to open a Baghdad- based as well as regional NGO training centers operated by his state ministry.  Khadim also intends to replace CPA Order 45 of that was promulgated to provide initial legal guidelines and requirements for emerging NGO work in Iraq.  While Order 45 served its intended purpose, he explained, its time has passed and, similar to the TAL, it needs to be replaced with something that reflects the new Iraq.  EmbOffs offered to explore the possibility of arranging technical assistance and meetings with prominent international NGOs for Khadim and his small staff, an offer he warmly embraced.  --------------------------------------------- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND NGO PROTECTION FROM INTRUSION ---------------------------------------------  6.  (C/NF) On May 30, Dawood Pasha, the departing head of the NGO Registry Office, told Deputy Prime Minister Abd al Mutlak al Jabhuri and EmbOffs that he was concerned over the apparent intrusion the State Ministry has initiated against the NGO Registry Office.  Specifically, Pasha alleged that, in coordination with the Khadim, the Sadr Bureau and Da'wa sent members to the NGO Registry Office for no apparent function other than to collect information on NGOs.  (Note:  On May 30, EmbOff discussed these allegations with Khadim, which he flatly denied.  End note.)  Pasha was also concerned that the actual NGO registry delivered to the Sadr Bureau.  7.  (C/NF) DPM Jaburi stated that the NGO Registry Office needed to remain apolitical, without party affiliation, and beyond any interference by other ministries.  Regarding the database, he promised to bring this issue to the attention of Prime Minister Jafari and initiate an investigation to determine if any loss of information actually occurred and to assess the security risk.  As a general measure to safeguard the activities of the NGO Registry Office, he said he would ask the PM's office to instruct the other ministers not to interfere with the activities of that office.  -------------------------------------- NGO OFFICE SHORTFALLS AND U.S. SUPPORT --------------------------------------  8.  (C/NF) Comment: We have seen positive signs for providing support and advocacy for the NGO community. However, when faced with difficult issues, the new authorities default to more government control.  The NGO Registry Office and the State Minister could both benefit from technical support and exposure to successes in the international community, both of which can be coordinated by post.  9.  (C/NF) (continued) While the State Ministry leadership is new and seeks to define its role in government and civil society affairs, its value in the constitution development process appears marginal. National Assembly members have commented to PolOff that they doubt the State Ministry could be a major contributor in the process.  The primary civil society outreach effort is coming from the local NGO community on its own initiative (a positive sign) as well as the international NGO community.  End comment.  10.

(U) PARTICIPANTS: U.S. --- THE DEPUTY SECRETARY CHARGE D'AFFAIRES JAMES JEFFREY AMBASSADOR RICHARD JONES, COORDINATOR FOR IRAQ AMBASSADOR DAVID SATTERFIELD, DCM AMBASSADOR ROSS WILSON, EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT MS. CHRISTINE DAVIES, SPECIAL ASSISTANT MS. ROB WALLER, SPECIAL ASSISTANT MR. ADMAN ERELI, SPOKESPERSON MR. SCOTT CARPENTER, NEA DAS MR. PETER GANSER, EMBASSY NOTETAKER IRAQ ---- NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER HAJIM AL HASSANI MR. SABAH TALAT KADRAT, CHIEF OF PROTOCOL 2. (S) SUMMARY: The Deputy Secretary highlighted to TNA Speaker Hassani on May 19 the importance of including Sunni Arabs in the constitution development process.  Hassani responded that only by adding Sunni representatives to the National Assembly's Constitution Drafting Committee would Sunnis achieve equal representation.  Hassani confirmed that there was support for using the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) as the basis for the new constitution and opined that the August 15 deadline would be achievable if the TAL was used as the basis.  The Deputy Secretary counseled against any extension to the August 15 deadline, as it would embolden the insurgency.  The Deputy Secretary urged Hassani to keep the Independent Electoral Commission well funded and focused for the upcoming referendum.  The Deputy Secretary stressed the importance of an ITG public position against sectarian violence.  END SUMMARY.  ---------------------------------------- AN INCLUSIVE CONSTITUTION MAKING PROCESS ----------------------------------------  3. (S) The Deputy Secretary urged Speaker Hassani to ensure the equal participation of Sunni Arabs in the constitution development process.  Sunni inclusion is a critical element of creating a new political process in Iraq, said the Deputy Secretary, and will help combat the insurgency.  The Deputy  SIPDIS Secretary also emphasized the importance of reaching out to  SIPDIS and engaging the Iraqi people in the constitution-making process as a key process step in any successful constitution development process.  4. (S) Speaker Hassani said the TNA had created a 55-member constitution drafting committee, only two of whom are Sunnis.  The lack of Sunni Arab representation on the committee would be problematic stated Hassani, and needs to be rectified. Discussions between the Kurds and List 169 members to resolve the matter are proceeding with two concepts under consideration.  The first concept is a separate constitutional commission with full and equal participation by Sunni members.  Any draft constitution from the commission would require the approval of the full committee.  The second concept is a twenty-member consultancy body external to the TNA with ten Sunni members.  Under either scenario, Sunnis will not receive "full and equal" standing, declared Hassani.  Only by expanding the committee to include 29 additional Sunni members, or 79 members in total, would the Sunnis achieve full and equal participation.  --------------------------------------- TAL AS BASIS FOR PERMANENT CONSTITUTION ---------------------------------------  5. (S) Deputy Secretary Zoellick spoke of the relevance and importance of using the TAL as a basis for the new constitution and asked how Hassani saw the August 15 deadline.  Hassani opined that the August 15 timeline would be doable only if the TAL served as the foundation for the new permanent constitution.  Two groups, the Kurds and Allawi's party, endorse the use of the TAL, stated Hassani, and even some List 169 members support the use of the TAL as a constitutional foundation.  If the TAL is not used as the basis, said Hassani, it would be very difficult to complete the draft constitution by August 15.  He added that a significant factor affecting the chances for timely completion would be whether the Iraqi people engage on the constitution's development.  6. (S) The Deputy Secretary cautioned Hassani that he should be very circumspect in exercising the use of the extension. The work will expand to fill the time of the extension, emphasized the Deputy Secretary.  Any slippage in the timeline will embolden the insurgency and do harm to the interests of the Iraqi government. ----------------------------------- ELECTION FRAMEWORK AND PREPARATIONS -----------------------------------  7. (S) Pointing to the significant role the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) will have in supporting the political process, the Deputy Secretary urged Hassani to keep the IECI well-funded and focused on its work.  Hassani indicated that the TNA had just finished establishing its rules and committees but will soon reach out to and work closely with the IECI to assist them.  Hassani also mentioned that the TNA's legal committee would work with the IECI to draft a new electoral law.  He added that he would not support an extension of the ITG and would press for elections in December &with or without a constitution.8  ---------------- LOCAL GOVERNANCE ----------------  8. (S) The Deputy Secretary encouraged Hassani to develop political support for the Transitional Government by empowering local officials.  Hassani commented that local officials in some areas were making progress, but in most areas the large political parties dominate the agenda and do not allow the emergence of new leadership.  9. (S) Addressing private sector capacity, the Deputy Secretary urged Hassani to build the private sector through  SIPDIS programs such as a micro-loan program, which could help increase employment throughout Iraq.  Hassani agreed with the Deputy Secretary that the private sector should receive the attention and support of the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG).  Hassani said he would also encourage investors from outside Iraq to help develop the private sector.  ------------------ SECTARIAN VIOLENCE ------------------  10. (S) Addressing the recent upswing in sectarian violence in Iraq, the Deputy Secretary spoke of the need for religious and government leaders in Iraq and the Muslim world to make strong public statements condemning sectarian violence and those, like Zarqawi, who seek to foment it.  The threat is real that this violence could lead to more serious strife within Iraq, he warned.  The democratically elected government of Iraq has considerable legitimacy and should use that political capital to make a clear and forceful statement condemning this violence.  The Deputy Secretary noted that action, combined with clear and forceful statements, could set the proper tone at this critical juncture.  11. (S) Hassani agreed with the Deputy Secretary that immediate action was needed to address sectarian violence. Observing that the streets of Baghdad are &controlled by militias,8 Hassani expressed alarm at rumors of police involvement in recent assassinations.  He opined that while statements are needed, the ITG also needs to take practical steps to head off this strife before it turns into a civil war.  There are some who are purposely committing these acts for the sole purposes of keeping the Sunnis out of the political process, claimed Hassani.  The Deputy Secretary assured Hassani the U.S. would do everything possible to help identify the perpetrators of the violence and stop it.  -------------- Justice Sector --------------  12. (S) The Deputy Secretary spoke of the importance of the independent judiciary and rule of law in Iraq and solicited the TNA's plans to bolster the justice sector.  Hassani agreed with the Deputy Secretary on the need for a strong and independent judiciary and opined that some judges, however, are still under the influence of the executive branch. Pointing to the recent arrests of former Ministers in the Interim Government, Hassani indicated that this is an attempt by the current government to retaliate against the former government of Prime Minister Allawi.  ---------------- U.S. ) EU SUMMIT ----------------  13. (S) Addressing the upcoming E.U. ) U.S. Summit on Iraq, the Deputy Secretary emphasized to Hassani the need to have a clear and prioritized plan to present to the international donor communnity.  While the Summit is not explicitly a donor conference, stated the Deputy Secretary, this is Iraq's opportunity to reinforce and help its political process via international support to key sectors within Iraq such as electricity, water, and agriculture.

Satterfield, Charge d'Affaires, fo  r reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Rowsch Shaways told Deputy Secretary May 19 that the schedule for development of a new constitution outlined in the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) must be kept.  He also said the Committee should include members from outside the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) to ensure adequate Sunni representation and prevent a potential boycott of the constitution.  Shaways said Iraq needs a free market economy, more investment, and a free pricing system.  Shaways said the Council of Judges should develop a security system for judges.  Shaways said the Government must take a unified stand, along with Shia and Sunni religious leaders, against sectarian violence, which is often attributed - without evidence - to the Badr Corps.  The Deputy Secretary reiterated USG support to Iraqi Security Forces, but emphasized the responsibility of the Iraqi people for the future of their country.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------- CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT --------------------------  2. (S/NF) Deputy Secretary met with Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Rowsch Shaways on May 19 to discuss political and economic issues, as well as the recent increase in sectarian violence.  The Deputy Secretary asked Shaways about the progress of constitutional development and how the public is being engaged in the process.  He noted the disquieting uncertainty about when the Constitutional Committee will begin its work.  Shaways said the need to meet the TAL deadlines must be balanced against the need for Sunni participation in the process.  Shaways accepted the need to include &real Sunnis8 and said the key was to include Sunnis who are believers in democracy and federalism - not the rejectionists.  Shaways also said the constitutional development process should be "consensus-driven" and not based on voting by Committee members.  3. (S/NF) Shaways added he does not agree with the Transitional National Assembly's (TNA) insistence on having only Assembly members as participants on the Constitutional Committee because it precludes adequate Sunni participation given their insignificant representation in the TNA. Individuals from outside the TNA should be part of the process, said Shaways, insisting that such expanded participation would not result in a substantially different constitution.  Instead, he said, it would provide the mechanism for "buy-in" by Sunnis and other minorities.  He added that a lack of such expanded participation could well result in a boycott of the new constitution.  4. (S/NF) The DPM also mentioned the idea of developing a committee comprising governmental representatives that would participate in the constitution drafting process.  He said it was a good step, but not sufficient.  Shaways went on to complain that the Government's work was slowed by a tendency to work only through certain ministerial committees that have been set up to address broad subject areas, such as security or civil society issues.  He insisted that this model would not work because the committees are too large and there are too many of them to be effective.  It is important, said Shaways, for the Government to focus on its priorities.  -------------------- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT --------------------  5. (C) Deputy Secretary noted the many upcoming events in June, including the International Monetary Fund Article IV consultations and the Brussels conference at the end of the month.  He said the ITG must have a clear set of its priorities - particularly for the Brussels conference - with respect to economic development such as agriculture and private sector development.  Specific suggestions as to how the international community can be more helpful would help to better focus assistance.  6. (C) Shaways said Iraq needs a free market economy, adding that investment must be encouraged.  Currently, the security situation precludes investment in many areas, he noted, and this must be addressed to support investment - either through the Government or private sector.  Another priority, Shaways indicated, is the implementation of a free pricing system - and he specifically pointed to the need for market fuel pricing.  He said these issues must be worked through the Council of Ministers.  7. (C) The Deputy Secretary concurred with DPM Shaways' views on pricing, especially with respect to fuel.  The current pricing policy, he said, brings with it all the wrong incentives, resulting in the misuse of electricity and fuel. He pointed out that a great deal of natural gas, which could be used for fuel for power plants, is currently burned because there is no way to capture it.  The Deputy Secretary re-emphasized the need for the ITG to develop its priorities for better policy making.  The elections, he said, gave a whole new face to Iraq and the international community definitely wants to assist.  However, it needs a single focal point in the ITG to facilitate better support.  ------------- THE JUDICIARY -------------  8. (C) Shaways briefly discussed the judiciary, noting that most judges in Iraq are former Ba'athists and alleging that Saddam,s regime forced all judges to be involved in the execution of opposition figures (thereby tainting the judges).  He said that, until there is a new generation of judges, it would be difficult to find "clean" judges or those who are unafraid of bringing judgments.  Shaways did note that there are some good judges at the Federal level and said the most important duty of the Council of Judges is to reconstruct the security system for judges.  Conceding that a 100-percent solution is not likely, the DPM said even a 50-percent solution would be acceptable.  ------------------ SECTARIAN VIOLENCE ------------------  9. (C) In response to Deputy Secretary's question about the recent increase in sectarian violence, Shaways suggested several possibilities for who is perpetrating it and why.  He noted the routine accusations - although without credible evidence - against the Badr Corps.  He said the Government must use the "Maghawir" (Ministry of Interior commandos) to counter the violence and clearly state its position.  A clear statement of ITG policy, he said, would go "a long way" to stopping the violence.  He also said that contact must be made with the Shia religious leaders, specifically Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, to secure their assistance.  The DPM also said there would always be a tendency for Sunni Ba'athists and radicals to try to incite sectarian violence.  10. (C) The Deputy Secretary agreed that a comprehensive government approach to insurgency and violence is key to Iraq's continued progress.  He told DPM Shaways that part of the Government's job is to set the core values and morality of the country.  It now has the opportunity to make unified statements to the public - combined with statements by both Shia and Sunni religious leaders - to emphasize that the violence is not part of its vision for Iraq and terrorists such as Zarqawi are nothing but murderers.  He also suggested that the ITG encourage others in the Islamic world to make similar statements to reinforce this sense of unity against sectarian violence.  The Deputy Secretary told Shaways that the Kurds could help to bring the Shia and Sunni together on this issue.  11. (S/NF) Shaways said both the Sunni and the Shia are pulling Iraq in a direction that is inconsistent with democracy and indicated that support by Coalition Forces remains necessary.  Noting that the Coalition's mandate pursuant to UNSCR 1546 would end after the elections scheduled for the end of the year, the Deputy Secretary reassured the DPM that the USG would continue to work with Iraqi Security Forces to prepare them for fully taking over Iraq's security.  He emphasized the need to continue to assess the situation but emphasized "we are in this for success."  Ultimately, he said, it is up to Iraqis to guide their country to its ultimate goal, hence the importance of addressing the problem of sectarian violence.  12.

Satterfield, Charge d'Affaires, f  or reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C/NF) Summary: During a May 19 meeting with Prime Minister Jafari, the Deputy Secretary highlighted the need for an integrated strategy (political, economic, and security) to defeat the insurgency.  As part of that strategy, he emphasized the need for inclusiveness and the importance of sticking to the constitutional schedule.  He urged Iraqi political and religious leaders to take a firm, united stand against the sectarian violence spurred by the Zarqawi network.  He advised Jafari to prepare a plan reflecting the ITG,s top economic priorities in advance of the June 22 Brussels Conference.  Jafari informed the Deputy Secretary of the formation of a new ministerial committee to  SIPDIS support the constitution drafting process and incorporate Sunnis into the process.  He also outlined his cabinet's efforts to isolate the insurgency and bolster public confidence in the government.  End summary.  ----------------------------------------- Including Sunnis in Constitution Drafting -----------------------------------------  2. (C/NF) In a May 19 meeting with Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafari in Baghdad, Deputy Secretary Zoellick reviewed the need for a three-pronged strategy ) political, economic/reconstruction, and security ) to defeat the insurgency.  Jafari agreed.  With respect to political strategy, Jafari acknowledged that the composition of the National Assembly (TNA) does not accurately reflect the demographic reality of Iraq.  The TNA,s 55-member constitutional committee is similarly skewed.  To redress this imbalance, Jafari announced he will head a new eight-minister committee, including five notable Sunnis, that will "assist" Parliament's constitutional committee.  Jafari said the real purpose of the ministerial committee is to ensure that Sunni voices are represented in the constitutional drafting process.  The Deputy Secretary pointed out that increased public inclusion in the constitutional process can counter insurgent efforts to exploit divisions in Iraqi society.  The Deputy Secretary urged that Iraqi religious and political leaders stand together and condemn sectarian violence and its architects, especially Zarqawi.  ------------------------- Readying an Economic Plan -------------------------  3. (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary observed that June will be an important month for Iraq on the economic front.   The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) review, the upcoming Brussels Conference, and the Joint Economic Committee, all present opportunities to further Iraq's reconstruction.  He suggested the ITG develop a short-term plan based on a small number of economic priorities, which the ITG could then present to donors at the Brussels Conference.  Noting Minister of Planning Barham Salih,s excellent international reputation, the Deputy Secretary observed that both Salih and Finance Minister Allawi could play significant roles in explaining Iraq's plan to donor countries.  The Deputy Secretary outlined USG priorities for reconstruction  SIPDIS assistance, such as rehabilitation of Iraq,s electrical system (with an eventual transition to natural gas as the key fuel for electricity generation), creation of agricultural sector jobs, completion of water and sanitation projects, and promotion of small businesses through mirco-loans.  4. (C/NF) Jafari agreed with the need for a focused economic plan, saying that public opinion polls show that security and the delivery of essential services remain the top concerns of ordinary Iraqis.  He said Salih and Allawi will work with his office in leading the review and analysis of proposals for an economic plan.  According to Jafari, his economic team would focus on ensuring the most disadvantaged areas of the country receive the largest portion of aid resources.  Provincial governments will be an integral part of the process of allocating resources and will be responsible for implementation and oversight of programs.  He said this decentralized approach would strengthen the administrative and political relations between Baghdad and the provinces.  ------------------------------- How to Isolate Sunni Extremists ------------------------------- 5. (C/NF) With regard to stemming the rise in sectarian violence, Jafari explained that there is a distorted view of the relative strength of the insurgency.  He said while acts of violence appear to be on the rise, the random, undisciplined nature of the attacks on Iraq,s citizenry suggests that the insurgents are desperate and isolated. Jafari added that as the insurgents sense progress in the political sphere, they face increased pressure from within their circles to commit acts of terrorism.  Jafari also noted that the process of Sunni engagement continues.  He recently met with Sunni leaders from Ramadi and was preparing to visit Fallujah.  He also promoted the idea of releasing a select group of Sunni clerics and detainees (not yet charged with crimes) held by the ISF and MNF-I as a gesture of good will by the Iraqi government.  He agreed that the ITG must speak with a unified voice and stress to the public that Zarqawi is not an Iraqi, but an evil foreign terrorist.  The Deputy Secretary affirmed that the U.S. remains fully committed to  SIPDIS training the Iraqi Security Forces and engaging in joint planning operations, and stressed the need to avoid any surprises in the U.S.-ITG security relationship.  6. (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary observed that some U.S. military commanders had been approached by extremist elements in west Anbar seeking further discussions with U.S. and Iraqi leaders; he asked how Jafari viewed such overtures.  Jafari firmly replied that the government is ready to talk.  Jafari then recounted recent positive signals he had received from the Syrian MFA.  The Deputy Secretary pointed out that these new intimations of Syrian interest in engaging the Iraqi leadership were evidence that the international pressure on Damascus was working.  The Deputy Secretary encouraged the Prime Minister to make clear that Syria should not interfere in Iraq,s internal affairs and should do more to control the border.  The Deputy Secretary urged Jafari to push Syrian President Asad hard on these issues and remind him that Iraq would not remain in its weakened state for long ) and would not forget Syria,s unhelpful behavior.  Jafari agreed.  7. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.  Jeffrey

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June.1 were the developments of the security and political situations. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Accidental mistake" (Ad-Dustoor, June 1) B. "In preparation for the upcoming elections" (Al-Mada, June 1)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Accidental mistake" (6/1)  Ad-Dustoor (independent) published a front-page editorial by Bassem Al-Sheikh about the arrest of the Iraqi Islamic Party leader:  "The improper arrest of Dr. Muhsin Abdul Hamid has proven to be a mistake and the occupation forces were forced to respond to the arrest by saying it was unintentional. However, this arrest is a serious violation against Iraqi political figures and groups. This is not the first incident because many Iraqi politicians have been arrested under weak pretexts. We noticed that the arrest came after the Iraqi government announced its thanks to Dr. Hamid for condemning the terrorist operations that target innocent Iraqis. Dr. Hamid was arrested without reference to his scientific, patriotic and political position.  This represents a direct disregard for human rights.  Dr. Hamid was insulted, arrested by mistake, but in the end, they apologized to him. This story reminds me of the deposed dictator who used to execute innocent Iraqis and later realized that they were innocent. After he killed them, he sent a handwritten apology to the victim's family as if nothing unusual had happened. It seems that history has started to repeat itself.  We cannot believe that an American force could conduct an early morning raid on a house of a prominent figure like Dr. Hamid and then consider the action as an unintentional mistake. It seems that this arrest was an operational mistake based on incorrect information. Indeed, if this is what really happened this means that perhaps hundreds of detainees were arrested according to wrong information and they are still kept in custody.  The Iraqi situation can not bear anymore mistakes either intentional or unintentional."   B. "In preparation for the upcoming elections" (6/1)  Al-Mada (independent) published a last-page editorial by Muhammad Sa'eed Al-Saghar about the upcoming Iraqi elections:  "We have successfully held elections, formed a national assembly and a new government. However, this accomplishment was our dream and we did not want to make this dream come true through a cesarean section. It is not our choice to make Iraq suffer from the current ethnic and sectarian crisis because this crisis is a result of the occupation. Meanwhile, we have to call for national unity and we must preserve social and national tolerance. Iraq has different ethnicities and sects.  No one group has the right to control it by itself because Iraq is for all Iraqis.  And all Iraqis must have equal rights.  Before holding the upcoming elections the Iraqi people must weigh in on the ethnic power-sharing experiment.  This experiment was the basis for establishing the new government.  We want the next elections to be based on direct voting for the candidates.  We do not want these elections to be based on the electoral lists.  These lists may contain candidates we do not know about.  We want efficient and loyal candidates who protect the interests of the people and the country.  We want candidates who will move Iraq away from sectarianism, racism, and tyranny.  We are all citizens of the new Iraq. The government must guarantee the rights of all people. This must be done by the law and not by people who have a monopoly on information."  JEFFREY

Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C/NF) Summary.  Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Constitutional Committee chairman Shaykh Humam al-Hammudi apprised CODELS Biden and Weldon of the status of the constitutional process May 30.  Al- Hammudi said the committee expected to make a decision on how to include Sunnis at its June 2 meeting, either by allowing various Sunni groups to choose "influential" Sunnis or to hold political caucuses in under-represented governorates.  A 7-person committee led by Constitutional Committee deputy-chair Adnan al- Janabi is reaching out to the Sunnis and consolidating views.  Al-Hammudi also noted that dividing the committee into thematic sub-committees would help them meet the August 15 deadline, as would using the TAL as a starting point.  End Summary.  2.  (C/NF) CODELS Biden and Weldon on May 30 met with the TNA Constitutional Committee chairman and Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) deputy Shaykh Humam al-Hammudi to discuss progress on Sunni inclusion and the constitution.  This was al- Hammudi's first meeting with a congressional delegation.  3.  (C/NF) Al-Hammudi stressed the principles that would guide Iraqis in drafting their constitution - democracy, pluralism, and federalism.  He added that Iraq would operate according to the rule of law and would consider Islam the state religion, while providing freedom for other religions, and would respect the role of women.  The constitution committee would face the arduous task of putting these principles into details, but Hammudi thanked the UN and other organizations for providing information that would assist the process.  4.  (C/NF) Regarding Sunni inclusion in the constitutional process, Al-Hammudi noted that the constitutional committee was looking at two different ways in which to add Sunnis to the committee.  The first is to add 13-15 "influential" Sunnis to the already existing 55 members.  The second would be to hold partial elections for 13-15 representatives from the various under-represented governorates.  While al- Hammudi acknowledged the second approach is more democratic, he feared it would require too much time. Al-Hammudi assured the CODEL that the committee would accept whomever the Sunnis choose in either approach and described a 7-person committee of constitutional committee members, led by deputy chairman Adnan al- Janabi who is taking the lead on reaching out to Sunnis to see how the Sunnis want to choose their representatives. Al-Hmmudi also noted the constitutional committee would make a final decision on which approach to take on June 2.  5.  (C/NF) In response to Senator Biden's question of whether Sunnis would be accorded "voting rights" on the committee, Al-Hammudi indicated the committee's decisions would be conducted on the basis of "tawafaq".  (Note:  Al-Hammudi preferred to translate this word as "middle ground" rather than "consensus" or "agreement".  End Note.)  Al-Hammudi also noted that unofficial Sunni representatives will be participating in the process while they are choosing the official Sunni members.  Senator Biden expressed that the Shia were expressing the marks of "true statesmen" in reaching out to Sunnis, especially as they were the ones to risk their lives by voting in the elections.  Al-Hammudi responded that Iraq is not like Pakistan, in which there are genuine divisions and problems between Sunni and Shia.  6.  (C/NF) Rep. Mark Green asked al-Hammudi whether he thought Arabic would be the only recognized language in the new constitution.  Al-Hammudi responded that Arabic had been considered the only official language in the past; however, TAL recognized both Arabic and Kurdish as Iraq's official languages.  Al-Hammudi noted that it remains to be seen what the committee and TNA will choose on this topic.  7.  (C/NF) On Rep. Green's question of the status of Ba'thists' ability to participate in government, Hammudi said only criminals and high-level Ba'thists would be prevented from serving in government, according to the de-Ba'thification policy.  8.  (C/NF) Members of the CODEL asked about progress towards achieving the August 15 deadline.  Al-Hammudi responded that the constitutional committee will be divided into sub-committees to enable them to tackle various constitutional topics expeditiously.  In addition, al-Hammudi hoped the committee would use the TAL, an already established common reference point as the starting point for the constitution, which would also speed up the process.  9.

Satterfield, Charge d'Affaires, f  or reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S) SUMMARY.  Charge joined British Charge and Danish Ambassador in a June 1 joint demarche to Minister of Interior Baqr Jabr on allegations of prisoner abuse in Basrah.  UK Charge provided an intelligence report implicating the Basrah Police's Internal Affairs Division and Investigations Support Unit of crimes, including the death of a detainee whom British and Danish forces had handed over to the police. Charge, British Charge, and Danish Ambassador expressed grave concern over the numerous allegations of abuse by Ministry employees and told Jabr that those found guilty of crimes as result of transparent investigations and fair trials must be brought to justice.  Jabr reiterated that respect for human rights is his first priority, said he would not tolerate such abuses, and promised to launch a public investigation into the Basrah allegations.  END SUMMARY.  2. (S) Charge joined British Charge Tim Torlot and Danish Ambassador Torben Getterman on June 1 to demarche Minister of Interior Baqr Jabr on prisoner abuse charges against the Basrah police.  UK Charge outlined the case of Abbas Allawi, a suspected terrorist whom British and Danish forces had handed over to the Iraqi Police (IP) in Basrah.  While in the custody of the IP, Allawi, who was reportedly held in an illegal Ministry of Interior (MOI) facility during his 10 - 13 April detention, was allegedly tortured and beaten to death.  3. (S) An autopsy performed by the Iraqis as part of an investigation initiated by the Basrah Governor and Chief of Police substantiated charges that Allawi was beaten to death.  UK Charge provided Jabr with an HQ 12th Mechanized Brigade intelligence report that implicates three members of Basrah's Department of Internal Affairs and Investigations Support Unit (ISU) of assassinations, kidnappings, intimidation, bribery, threats against the judiciary, and illegal attacks against the citizens of Basrah.  The report specifically implicates the ISU's Lieutenant Abbas Munis for the torture and murder of Allawi.  Those three individuals have been suspended, said UK Charge, and he emphasized that the investigation into these allegations must continue unimpeded.  The problem, he said, is far more widespread than indicated in a single report.  4. (S) Grave concerns regarding the Basrah situation, said UK Charge, extend to MOI as a whole and were the reason for the joint demarche.  He emphasized the importance of investigating such allegations of abuse, ensuring perpetrators are tried by a fair and transparent judiciary, and bringing those found guilty to justice.  UK Charge pointed out that the crimes of corrupt IP are well known on the streets of Basrah and said the Minister needs to show the Iraqi people that MOI will treat everyone fairly.  5. (S) The Charge added that such actions do not only affect the police and prisoners, but the general public as well.  He emphasized that MOI must ensure the fair treatment of all individuals from arrest to the disposition of a case.  Charge also told Jabr that all MOI prisoner holding facilities need to be under the proper jurisdiction. (NOTE: Per reftel, MOI still maintains facilities that belong under Ministry of Justice jurisdiction per CPA Order 10.  END NOTE.)  Charge expressed the highest regard for Jabr's consistent focus on supporting human rights and said how the Iraqi people and the world see such cases handled is key to their confidence in the system.  6. (S) Jabr reiterated what has, thus far, been a consistent message, identifying respect for human rights as his first priority.  He insisted that such disregard for the rights of the people would not be tolerated and said he would open an investigation within the week on the allegations reported by HQ 12th Mechanized Brigade.  Those involved, he said, would be brought to Baghdad to be publicly investigated and punished accordingly.  However, he cautioned, it would take time to correct the problems facing MOI regarding human rights abuses.  ------- COMMENT -------  7. (S) Jabr appeared to be sincere in his insistence that he would not tolerate human rights abuses by MOI employees, offering as evidence of his commitment the recent removals of several high-level MOI officials, to include the Deputy Minister for Police General Hekmat, who was suspected of human rights abuses such as the establishment of death squads.  However, increasingly, MOI and its various components are implicated in human rights abuses, based on reports of human rights activists, Sunni contacts and media reports.  Clearly, it will be a challenge for Jabr to implement a change of culture in a system that has previously not considered the rights of the individual.  In the short-term, however, the question is whether MOI will actually follow up by investigating the Basrah allegations and bringing to justice those found guilty of criminal behavior.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June. 2 were the developments of the security, political situations and the constitution's drafting process. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "May Hammurabi appear and draft our constitution" (Al- Mashriq, 6/2) B. "Syria's interest is to cooperate with Iraq" (Al-Adala, 6/2)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "May Hammurabi appear and draft our constitution" (6/2)  Al-Mashriq (independent) published a front-page editorial by Hamid Abdullah about the new constitution:  "The constitution is a society's philosophy drafted into the language of law. It is a mechanism for the government to practice power. It is also the essence of people's doctrines. Sociologists say that the laws reflect a society's values. If we want to know the values of a specific society, we have to look at its laws. Therefore, if the constitution does not represent all perspectives and aspirations of a society, the drafters of such a constitution are separated from their society. For this reason, the developed nations used to make their former presidents members of their constitutional committees. Those committees were responsible for examining and comparing laws that are enacted by the legislative authority within the constitution.  If these laws contradict any constitutional item or paragraph, the law would be cancelled regardless of which authority enacted it. This is exactly what happens in France and other countries with progressive governments. In Iraq, the problem of drafting the constitution is not separate from the dilemma of forming the government. In fact, it is more complicated than the problem of forming the government because this issue can be solved by harmony and ethnic power sharing. On the other hand, drafting the constitution requires the interaction of the philosophies, ideologies and affiliations of the constitutional committee's members. All these attitudes must come together so that the constitution can be drafted. The problem is in determining how to unite conflicting opinions. How can drafters agree to write a constitution only using one philosophy to draft constitution? If Hammurabi had been living in our time, he would have been assassinated by unknown gunmen because he ignored demands of the Iraqi sects, parties and tribes. Yet, I wish that Hammurabi would appear to solve the problem of our constitution."  B. "Syria's interest is to cooperate with Iraq" (6/2)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a fourth-page editorial by Zuhair Al-Dijaili about Syrian relationship with Iraq:  "Syria has stopped intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation with the U.S., although observers do not know much about this cooperation. Washington sees this as an indicator that Syria insists on keeping its attitude unchanged regarding Iraqi and Lebanese issues. Damascus said that it has supported Iraq, but Washington does not fully appreciate its positive attitude. The U.S. Secretary of State said that Damascus did not offer anything concerning the Iraqi security cooperation. Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Hoshiyar Zebari ended this controversial discussion by saying that Iraq does not have a good relationship with Syria.  He said that Damascus does not cooperate with Baghdad on the security situation in Iraq. Baghdad has submitted to Damascus the names of activists who command the insurgency in Iraq. Baghdad asked Damascus to prevent those activists from staying in Syria.  Baghdad demanded that Syria hand over wanted Iraqis and to stop infiltration. Iraq has sent five memoranda to Syria about these issues, but Damascus has not responded. Syria claims that there is a joint Iraqi-Syrian security committee, but a source in the Iraqi government says that such a committee was uselessly formed one year ago. Iraqi sources confirm that there are members of Syrian-funded terrorist gangs wounded in Al-Qa'im military operations who escaped to Syria for medical treatment.  On the other hand, we hope that Al-Jafari's expected visit to Syria will make Syria change its attitudes toward Iraq. The Iraqi government believes that the situation in Iraq will be stabilized if Syria stops funding and supporting terrorists and insurgents in Iraq. An Iraqi security official said that Damascus should know that the past is gone, and it should bet on the peaceful development of Iraq. Everyone knows that a stabilized Iraq will benefit Syria's stability."  SATTERFIELD

THIS CABLE CONTAINS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION - FOR GOVERNMENT USE ONLY - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION ON THE INTERNET.  1. (SBU) In a June 1 meeting with IRMO reps Minister of Trade Abd' al-Bassit Kareem informed us that he does not expect new wheat, sugar or rice imports into Iraq for the Public Distribution (food ration) System (PDS) until mid- July.  According to the Minister, US wheat, including a shipment from Cargill continues to offload in Tartous, Syria and is being distributed throughout Iraq.  He also informed us that on May 31 he was interviewed by Al Arabiya television and informed the audience that new procedures are being developed by the Ministry that should allow PDS food supplies to flow more regularly in July.  2. (SBU) The Minister also developed and proposed new contracting procedures for the Ministry and submitted them to the Cabinet.  He believes these will be approved in the coming week.  Minister Kareem agreed to share the new procedures with us once they are approved.  Wheat, sugar and rice tenders are currently being finalized for the PDS. Minister Kareem will limit these tenders to well-established international suppliers and consortia, sticking to a vow he made during our initial meetings with him. (septel)  3. (SBU) In addition to expecting a two-week timeline for bids to come in for the Ministry's tender, Minister Kareem is meeting twice weekly with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to ensure funding for the anticipated tenders.  In addition to the current tenders, he continues to work closely with the MOF to line up funding for an additional 2 to 5 months worth of PDS requirements.  His intention is to build reserves, funding permitting.  4. (SBU) In addition to PDS issues, the Minister continues to worry about security:  both his own and that of the new Ministry compound.  IRMO is working to address his concerns. A new MOT satellite office within the International Zone should be ready for occupancy in the next weeks, providing a more secure location for the Minister to meet with USG representatives.

Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C) Summary.  Muqtada al-Sadr representatives facilitated discussions between Badr Corps and Muslim Ulema Council (MUC) officials on Hareth al-Dhari's May 18 comments accusing the Badr Corps of assassinating Sunni clerics.  The group met May 28 in the residence of Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Sadrist member Baha al-Araji in Baghdad to come to terms on a proposed "Letter of Promise" agreeing to cast away past rhetoric and work to minimize sectarian violence. Despite initial progress in the discussions, no agreement has been signed.  Badr Corps representatives say they are committed to continued engagement with MUC. Muqtada al-Sadr continues to burnish his image as a nationalist leader.  End Summary.  --------------- MUC Accusations ---------------  2.  (C) In a televised press conference on May 18, MUC leader Hareth al-Dhari accused police commandos and the Badr Corps of killing two Sunni clerics that week as well as participating in several other earlier killings targeting Sunnis.  Shia notable and SCIRI head Abdul Aziz al-Hakim responded by calling for calm and an end to accusations that could lead to sectarian war.  Badr Corps chief Hadi al-Amiri on May 19 denounced the accusations.  Al-Amiri told PolCouns on May 21 that he was doing his best to keep things calm. PolCouns emphasized that it is important for senior leaders on all sides to keep young, impressionable men off the street in this sensitive period.  Al-Amiri said that Sunni notable Adnan Dulaimi (Sunni Waqf) visited SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim on May 20. According to Al-Amiri, both men agreed that all mosques (Sunni and Shia) should not be used for political or military purposes.  --------------------- Negotiations Commence ---------------------  3.  (C) Sadrist TNA member Baha al-Araji and Iraqi Hizbullah TNA member Abd al-Karim Muhammadawi told PolOff May 31 that discussions on May 28 between the MUC and Badr Corps over a proposed "Letter of Promise" were initially encouraging.  Al-Araji asserted that the discussions were initiated by Muqtada al-Sadr and that his brother, Hazim Al-Araji, and Sadr Bureau notables Abdul Hadi al-Daraji and Shaykh Nasser al- Saadi were facilitating these discussions "in the interest of Iraq."  Badr Corps Political Advisor Abdul Kareem al-Naqib told PolOff on May 31 that the Badr Corps refused to sign the letter without an apology from Hareth al-Dhari or presentation of hard evidence of Badr Corps participation in the recent attacks on Sunni clerics.  Al-Naqib said that Badr Corps leader Hadi al-Amiri went to visit Muqtada al-Sadr on May 29 in Najaf and the two men agreed to continue engaging the MUC.  4.  (C)  Al-Naqib said that the MUC representatives (Al-Rawi and Al-Ani) alleged that the Badr Corps participated in MNF-I operations in Fallujah and helped the Iraqi Government manipulate the elections results through their control of elections security. According to Al-Naqib, Al-Rawi and Al-Ani also asserted that the Badr Corps is predominant in MOI's Wolf Brigade now conducting operations in Baghdad and that this unit was likely behind the Sunni clerics' deaths.  Al-Naqib told PolOff that, in response, he detailed several acts of political violence directed against the Shia.  Al-Naqib said that while the MUC represents a minority of Sunnis, he believes that the Shia must engage in these discussions in the interest of national unity.  According to Al-Naqib, the MUC representatives originally proposed signing the Letter of Promise to "wash away the past".  5.  (C) Hadi al-Amiri told PolOff on June 1 that the Badr Corps is willing to sign "100 letters" if they receive an apology.  Conversely, Al-Amiri said that if there is such evidence of Badr Corps militia taking part in these killings, he would personally seek justice against these criminals and drop the lawsuit against Hareth al-Dhari.  PolOff urged al-Amiri to avoid harsh rhetoric that could disrupt efforts to promote inclusion in the constitutional process.  6.  (C) Al-Amiri said that the Badr Corps is committed to continue engaging the MUC.  Al-Naqib was much more ominous in his comments.  He said that if Al-Dhari does not apologize, he could find himself unable to move freely about Iraq, especially in the middle Euphrates region and the South.  After Poloff criticized the implied threat, Al-Naqib said that he simply meant that Al-Dhari would be met by public demonstrations that would be peaceful but would effectively limit his ability to move about the country.  --------------- Muqtada's Role ---------------  7.  (C) Al-Amiri told PolOff that he felt compelled to personally meet Al-Sadr as he is now a legitimate political force.  According to Al-Amiri, Al-Sadr urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict between MUC and Badr.  Al-Sadr also reportedly told Al-Amiri that he is committed to joining the political process but from a distance through his key lieutenants.  Al-Naqib was much more blunt in his analysis of Al-Sadr's involvement.  He told PolOff that he thought Al-Sadr was being opportunistic and that his actions should be watched closely.  8.  (C) Comment:  The Badr Corps-MUC discussions may not result in a written agreement.  Both sides' willingness to engage is positive.  Both sides also appear to be sensitive to the fragile, simultaneous outreach efforts to promote at Sunni participation in the constitutional drafting process.  The seeming contradiction between Muqtada's willingness to play peacemaker and his harsh rhetoric against the US is explained by his drive to be seen as a true "nationalist" leader.  His remarks demanding immediate release of detainees should be seen in the context of his key lieutenants' willingness to engage the Iraqi government on facilitating additional releases of detained Sadrists.  The restraint demonstrated by the Sadr Bureau in reaction to the May 23 car bomb attack on the edge of Sadr City was also indicative of their growing willingness to engage in politics rather than combat.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002376  SIPDIS  NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2015 TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, MCAP, PREL, PTER, PINS, PINR, MARR, IZ, Parliament SUBJECT: ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ'S MINISTER OF INTERIOR AFTER ONE MONTH  REF: A. BAGHDAD 001844      B. BAGHDAD 001995      C. BAGHDAD 002210  Classified By: Classified by Political-Military Counselor Ronald E. Neumann for reasons 1.4 (a), (b) and (d).  1.  (S/REL UK AND AUS) SUMMARY: In the month since Minister of Interior Baqir Jabor took office, he appears to be delivering on his initial commitments (ref A).  Jabor retained qualified personnel regardless of their ethnic background or political affiliation, while also developing a plan to remove unqualified personnel.  Jabor traveled to Najaf to discuss national versus provincial roles with the Governor and Chief of Police.  To emphasize the importance of the provincial Chiefs of Police, Jabor held a national conference in Baghdad his second week in office.  Although rumors and innuendo are always circulating, there is no specific evidence to support widespread concerns of a Shia-led security strategy within the Ministry of Interior (MoI) directed against the Sunni.  Nothing is guaranteed to last, but Jabor seems to be actively reforming the MoI to address the security challenges Iraq is facing.  END SUMMARY  2.  (C/REL UK AND AUS) SENIOR PERSONNEL: Jabor's personnel actions are commendable.  Prior to making any personnel decisions, Jabor sought recommendations from the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO)- MoI advisors and the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I).  Jabor has met with his Deputies on multiple occasions, both as a group and individually.  Jabor kept his word on retaining MG Adnan (a Sunni and the uncle of the former Minister of Interior) as the head of the special police, including the commandos.  After extensive consultation, Jabor retired two Deputy Ministers: MG Hekmet (Deputy Minister for the Iraqi Police Service) and MG Abdul Jabal (Deputy Minister for the National Crime Agency). Replacements have not been decided; however, Jabor intends to replace Hekmet with a young Sunni with career law enforcement experience based upon the individual's capabilities and not simply time spent in the Ministry.  We have a generally poor view of Hekmet; letting him go is a sound decision.  3.  (C/REL UK AND AUS) RANK AND FILE: Jabor stated he would not add to the ranks of the police for political patronage.  Jabor plans personnel system reforms that would release from duty or retire his predecessor's numerous Samarah patronage hires; "ghost" employees, who are on the payrolls, but perform no clear service for the ministry; employees identified as unqualified by the MoI Qualification Committee (MOIQC) (ref B); personnel age 60 or over (subject to waiver); and those charged by the inspector general with corruption.  Jabor asserts a commitment to retaining "hard-working professionals."  However, the predominantly Sunni work force (and likely the broader Sunni population) may perceive the terminations as a purge of their ranks.  Jabor is faced with significant budget constraints and understands that the number of police on the payroll needs to be reduced significantly.  4.  (C/REL UK AND AUS) PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL JURISDICTION: Last month, the MoI hosted a two-day Chiefs of Police conference that did not yield any specific results, but was valuable symbolically. Sixteen provincial Chiefs of Police attended; never before had this been accomplished.  The provincial representatives stayed late on a Thursday evening and even met on their day off, Friday.  CPA Order 71, which outlines, inter alia, provincial and national level authorities, was discussed at length among the attendees.  A healthy debate ensued with some attendees claiming ignorance of CPA Order 71, and others disagreeing with the order.  The real value of the conference was the opening of lines of SUBJECT: ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ'S MINISTER OF INTERIOR AFTER communication.  5.  (C/REL UK AND AUS) The Minister's trip to Najaf was a clear indication of his intention to address issues head-on.  Initially, there was concern that Jabor would not fully engage with IRMO-MoI advisors; the opposite has been true, as evidenced by the IRMO- MoI advisor accompanying the Minister to Najaf (ref C).  Once again the Minister kept his commitment to address problems that had been ignored by the previous Minister.  6.  (S/REL UK AND AUS) COMMENT: There is widespread concern of a Shia security strategy to purge the MoI ranks of Sunnis and implement a MoI de-Ba'athification plan.  Jabor was handed a Ministry with serious personnel, leadership, control and financial problems. The proactive agenda pursued by the Minister fits the task of reforming the Ministry; however, the dismissal of Sunni MoI employees, raids on Sunni insurgents and discussions with Shia leaders (such as Grand Ayatollah Sistani) leave an impression of a Shia plot against the Sunni.  7.  (S/REL UK AND AUS) COMMENT CONTINUED: Nothing we are seeing is guaranteed to remain the same.  Although the Minister continues to do and say the right things, we will remain vigilant.  The Minister is politically astute and a skilled technocrat who knows his every move is being watched for signs that Iran, the Shia, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and/or Badr Corps are controlling the Minister behind the scenes and directing unprovoked action against the Sunni population or implementing a separate de-Ba'athification policy.  We also remain cognizant of Shia influence in the south and continue to watch for incidents of Shia purging Sunnis from the police ranks at the provincial and local levels and installing SCIRI/Badr loyalists in their stead.  There are some indications that this may be occurring, albeit quietly (septel).  Jabor appears to be his own man; however, it is unclear to what degree his decisions are influenced by SCIRI, particularly its leader Hakim.  END COMMENT.  8.

S E C R E T BAGHDAD 002378  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2015 TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab, Parliament SUBJECT: RECOMMENDED S CALLS TO SUPPORT SUNNI INCLUSION   Classified By: CDA DAVID M. SATTERFIELD FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d).   1.  (S)  Embassy recommends that the President call PM Jaferi and the Secretary make phone calls to President Talabani, Vice President Adil Abd al-Mehdi, and TNA Speaker Hachim al-Hasani to press for a effective and rapid inclusion of Sunni Arabs in the constitution drafting process.  2.  (S) Septel describes the June 2 meeting that brought together Sunni representatives with members of the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Constitutional Committee.  The meeting was chaired by Committee vice chair Ahmed al Janabi, himself a Sunni member of the TNA.  The atmosphere was good, but the only result was an agreement that the Committee and the Sunni representatives would hold separate caucuses on June 5 to settle the issues of how to select Sunni representatives, their number  and their rights as members of the TNA committee.  The two groups would then meet again June 9 to close the deal.  3.  (S) Based on the track record of delay and unforeseen complications overcoming good intentions in the Iraqi political process and the approaching Constitutional deadlines, we think it time for the phone calls noted in para 1.  President Talabani can influence Constitution Committee Deputy Chairman Fuad Ma'asum, who is also in the PUK. Talabani in the past has made strong pitches to us about including Sunnis in the political process, and it is important that he sustain that position into the final shaping of the constitutional drafting body.  4.  (S) Vice President Adil Abd al-Mehdi can influence Consitution Committee Chairman Humam al-Hammudi, who is also in SCIRI, and SCIRI leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim.  He is therefore an appropriate level of government for S to contact, and also enables us to contact Abd al Mahdi's political boss, SCIRI leader Abd al Aziz al Hakim.  Given Abd al Mahdi's relative moderation, it is also useful to strengthen his prestige by making him the recipient of an S call.  SCIRI regularly says the right things, but at times its position, and those of other Shia Islamists impedes inclusion of Sunni Arab representatives who have real weight in their community.  It is important that Abdel al-Mehdi urge his own people to be realistic and flexible and not to drag the process out.  5.  (S) Hasani has oversight over the National Assembly and can keep the body focused on its most important mission.  He is supportive of the concept of Sunni inclusdion, but it would be useful to remind him that the Sunni Arab community needs to develop.  He is also touchy enough about his position to be unhelpful if he feels left out.  6.  (S) The Charge will complement these contacts with another round of meetings with Constitutional Committee Chair Hamoudi, his party boss, SCIRI leader Hakim, and Janabi.  7.  (S) Suggested Talking Points for Secretary's Calls:  -- Congratulations on your continued progress in the Constitutional process.  -- The talks of June 2 were a useful step in bringing credible, moderate Sunni representatives into the process.  -- We support every effort to bring Sunni Arabs to the drafting table as equal partners.  -- We are concerned that this be done in a manner that respects the right of Sunni Arabs to choose their own representatives.  -- We are also concerned that this process not be unnecessarily time-consuming and divisive.  -- Meeting the August 15 deadline is vital to maintaining the momentum of the political process into elections at the end of the year.

(C) Summary.  The Charge met with Tariq al Hashimi, Secretary General of the Iraqi Islamic Party to continue our  SIPDIS engagement with leading Sunni groups to encourage their participation in the constitutional process.  The Charge expressed regret for the recent detention of party leader, Mohsin abd Hamid.  Hashimi requested a written apology.  He explained his party's approach to the on-going efforts to include Sunnis in the drafting of the constitution and appeared optimistic.  He also described the decentralized structure of the IIP, which is the most prominent Sunni political party in Iraq.  End Summary.  2. (C) The Charge opened by expressing regret for the detention of Muhsin abd al Hamid, leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) on May 30.  He noted the USG had acted immediately to release abd al Hamid, a former Governing Council member and well-known member of the anti-Saddam resistance.  Tariq al Hashimi, General Secretary of IIP, accompanied by Nasir al Ani, said the USG cannot guarantee that such incidents will not be repeated.  He continued to demand a written letter of apology, stating that the rate and breadth of detentions are "overwhelming" the Sunni.  Hashimi claimed Sunnis interpret detentions, whether by Coalition or Iraqi Forces as a message that "the U.S. is looking to get the Sunni."  3. (C) Hashimi reaffirmed the Iraqi Islamic Party's commitment to friendship with the U.S.  He said that some in the party believe the Americans see the party as connected to the insurgency.  Hashimi asked the USG to present any such evidence, so that the IIP would have a chance to refute it. He denied the existence of any element in the party abetting the armed Iraqi resistance.  Hashimi admitted that the current situation is extremely tense for Sunnis.  He emphasized the "insurgents are killing us before they kill you."  4. (C) Hashimi appeared optimistic about the June 2 joint meeting of various Sunni political groups and the Transitional National Assembly's Constitutional Drafting committee.  While he postulated that the process of recruiting professional and representative Sunnis could be best expedited by allowing IIP to represent the entire community, Hashimi said the IIP had prepared a list for submission.  On a more realistic note, the General Secretary recognized that the IIP may not see all its candidates selected for the expanded Drafting Committee.  More important to his constituents, Hashimi claimed, was how the committee's input would be incorporated into the process.  He warned that the TNA must not simply treat the newly created body as consultants, but the appointed members' contributions should be weighed equally with the legally elected TNA representatives.  The Charge agreed that the process needed to be inclusive of credible, moderate Sunni representatives and that they should be chosen as soon as possible .  5. (C) Yet Hashimi noted the IIP was "willing to sacrifice itself" to hold to the deadline of August 15 for drafting the constitution.  He gave a brief overview of his party's organization, noting policy was set in Baghdad, but regional offices were allowed a fair amount of freedom, which he described as "decentralization."  6. (C) Comment.  Considering the flap over Mohsin abd Hamid's detainment, Hashimi was very engaging and optimistic about the effort to include the Sunnis into the next stage of the political process.  It was interesting to hear him describe the structure of the most prominent Sunni political party as decentralized, which was evidenced by the January 30 elections.  Diyala provincial IIP leadership petitioned the IIP for exemption to the national IIP's declared boycott of the January 30 elections, and received permission.  Anbar's IIP also participated, as did Ninewa's and all three seated IIP members in their respective Provincial Councils.  7. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, RE MSUL and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.

(C) SUMMARY: During the fifth meeting of the National Energy Committee (NEC), DPM Chalabi discussed his recent visit to the Al-Fatah crossing, expressing dissatisfaction with its current security.  He instructed the Ministry of Defense to immediately develop an effective security plan for the northern pipelines.  Chalabi also chided the ministers for poor intelligence, saying gathering intelligence should be an Iraqi led initiative.  The Ministers of Defense  (MOD) and Finance (MOF) debated the level of funds disbursed this fiscal year, with the MOF arguing that MOD had already received almost its entire allotment. The NEC discussed alternative export routes for oil and decided to review a pipeline option through Iran.   Newly negotiated water flows from Turkey, concerns for getting the water through Syria, and the competing needs of the agricultural and electricity sectors for that water were also discussed. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) DPM Ahmed Chalabi convened the fifth meeting of the ITG National Energy Committee on May 31.  The Ministers of Oil (MOO), Electricity (ME), Water Resources (MWR), Finance (MOF), Agriculture (MOA), Industry and Minerals (MIM) were present as well as the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense (SGMOD), MOD Director General of Programs and Budget, and the Commander of the Iraqi Army.  IRMO Acting Director MG Heine, IRMO MOD Advisor, and ECONOFF also attended. The Ministers of Interior (MOI) and Defense (MOD) did not attend.  Chalabi opened with a discussion of his visit to Kirkuk and Al Fatah on May 27 and his observations of pipeline security.  --------------------------------------------- ------------ AL FATAH CROSSING AND STATUS OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION --------------------------------------------- ------------  3.  (C) The DPM and MOO visited Kirkuk and Al Fatah to observe the Iraqi forces deployed to guard the Kirkuk to Bayji pipeline.  The DPM said he was dissatisfied with their level of competence, citing continued successful attacks on the pipeline.  The DPM used Al Fatah crossing as the prime example where security required improvement.  He said Al Fatah was the most critical point in the North for oil exports and stated that the lack of security and poor coordination of security forces at Al Fatah had permitted the destruction of the pipeline at that critical location.  "We need to solve this protection issue because this stops exports which earn funds for Iraq, and it stops the flow of oil to the Bayji refinery, which causes more shortages of fuels here in Iraq" said the DPM  4.  (C) The Minister of Oil concurred, saying the Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIBS)(NOTE: SIBS is the new term for the Oil Security Battalions (OSBs), because they will be used to protect more than just the oil infrastructure. END NOTE)) were ineffective.  MOO said he was willing to cooperate with MOD, but security must be done effectively. He said "Why should I fund SIBS if I do not get protection for my pipelines, especially this critical segment at Al Fatah?"  MOO said he could produce 600,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in the North, but it does no good if the oil cannot be transported through the pipelines.  -------------------------------------------- DEVELOPMENT OF PLAN TO PROTECT THE PIPELINES --------------------------------------------  5.  (C) The DPM asked the Commander of the Army if he had assigned an officer to be responsible for infrastructure security. The SGMOD responded that an officer had been assigned and stated there was also a plan being formed for protection of the pipelines, but the MOD could not fund these forces because they would cost $600 million, and it would take time to build and train these units, probably six months.  SGMOD continued by stating this was an internal security mission, which should belong to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), not the MOD.  The MOD needed the funds to buy the equipment, training and salaries for these units.  The Commander of the Army told the DPM that the SIBS were just hired tribesmen in uniform and were not properly equipped or trained. He needed help from Coalition forces for the training and oversight of these battalions.  6.  (C) DPM and MOO asked the SGMOD and the Army to provide a plan for the protection of the pipelines, stain their priority were the pipelines between Kirkuk and Bayji, including the Al Fatah Crossing.  The DPM stated that the Army must use the forces they currently had in uniform, and they could not wait six months.  The DPM instructed the SGMOD and the Commander of the Army to meet with Multi-National Forces ) Iraq (MNF-I) and come up with a joint plan for protection of key oil infrastructure no later than Monday, June 6.  The MWR and ME requested their critical infrastructure be included in this planning process with MNF-I.  DPM told the Army Commander that he should plan on providing Iraqi battalions to MNF-I for this mission.  7. (C) The DPM also requested that MNF-I be asked to come to the MOD to help with the planning.  Several Ministers echoed the comments that "If we cannot control one pipeline, we cannot control the country".  Additional Ministers added concerns for pipeline security in the South, as well as near Fallujah and Baghdad. The DPM asked the Ministries with concerns for infrastructure protection to work closely with the MOD and the Army to identify the key facilities requiring protection.  The DPM told the assembled Ministers "the Americans will give us support", but "There is no magic wand, we need infantry and intelligence to secure our pipelines."  ---------------------------- NEED FOR BETTER INTELLIGENCE ----------------------------  8.  (C) DPM Chalabi said the insurgents were winning the intelligence war.  He said it was an Iraqi responsibility to provide intelligence to the American forces.  This intelligence is key to infrastructure protection.  ----------------------------------- FUNDING DISPUTE BETWEEN MOD AND MOF ----------------------------------- 9.  (C) The MOF said that each SIB required $40 million to form, train, and equip, while the current cost of repairing the pipelines was $250 million.  The MOO added that lost revenues from exports represented an even greater cost.  The MOD DG of Programs and Budget suggested Iraq use technology rather than soldiers to protect the pipelines, advocating for aircraft patrols along the pipelines instead of troop deployments, as she thought it would be less expensive.  The Minister of Finance added that he thought the government should put pressure on the tribal leaders who were being paid $100 million to protect these pipelines.  The MOF said the Iraqi Army had received $4.2 billion to support military operations. The SGMOD said they had been told the military was to get $4.5 billion, but nothing had yet been received. MOF said he had receipts proving the military had received $4.2 billion this year from the Iraqi budget.  MOF and MOD continued to stick to their disputed positions of funds disbursed but supposedly not received.  DPM requested MOF and MOD meet separately to assess their differences in funding.  10.  (C) DPM Chalabi said the military had received substantial funding, and now the government needs a payment back from the military in the form of protection of the pipelines.  The military must use its battalions to give protection to oil pipelines.  He stated, "The money spent on MOD has not paid off." DPM Chalabi asked the MOF to provide to all of the Ministers a full accounting of the funds for all Ministries, so there would be transparency in government.  Several of the Ministers, most aggressively the MIM, suggested it was more important to fund the military force protection of the pipelines than to have a balanced budget, because without protection, no money could be generated from oil exports.  DPM closed this discussion with the comment: "The problem of infrastructure protection is critical, and we need to solve it."  ---------------------------------- OPTIONS FOR NORTHERN EXPORTING OIL ----------------------------------  11.  (C) DPM Chalabi and the MOO suggested options for the export of Northern oil from Iraq.  They concluded that exporting through Turkey would be preferred, but if it could not be accomplished due to security problems, then Iraqi oil could potentially be exported via Saudi Arabia, Basrah, or Iran.  The discussion on the possibility of using Saudi pipelines was dismissed due to security problems in the southwest of Iraq.  The possibility of expanding exports in Basrah was dismissed because of inadequate pipeline access from the North, lack of storage facilities in Basrah, and port infrastructure problems.  The final option of exporting oil from Kirkuk through Iran was discussed in terms of the security and pipeline construction requirements.  The DPM said during the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq had built a very long pipeline in only nine months, and thus a route through Iran was possible as an alternative export route.  MOO concurred with the DPM, and he requested additional consideration by the Ministers of a northern oil export pipeline route through Iran.  --------------------------------------------- -------------- INCREASED ELECTRICITY FROM ADDED WATER FLOWS FROM TURKEY --------------------------------------------- --------------  12.  (C) The Minister of Water Resources (MWR) reported he had talked to the Turkish Ambassador, and that Turkey would release an additional water flow of 200 cubic meters of water per second for Iraq.  This would increase the electrical power generation at Iraqi hydropower facilities.  MWR had not yet discussed this deal with Syria.  Syria had also requested increased water releases from Turkey, but the amount requested is unknown to MWR. The downstream compact for Syria and Iraq is normally a 58/42 (Iraq/Syria) split of water flow.  The Turkish Ambassador told the MWR that Iraq needed to inform Syria of this new water flow agreement, and that this discussion needed to be between Iraq and Syria.  The ME emphasized to MWR how important this water was to Iraq, and requested the MWR talk to his counterpart in Syria immediately. This additional water would provide an additional 750 MW of power in Iraq. The total goal for hydropower production is 1500 MW, as set by the DPM.  13.  (C) The Minister of Agriculture (MOA) said water was needed for agriculture and the diversion for electricity would ruin this year's crops if it were all diverted.  MOA stated agriculture required 350 cubic meters of water per second for agricultural irrigation.  The ME said he had a proposed reduced rate of electricity production for the summer because of the concerns over food production losses due to diversion from agriculture.  The ME recommendation to the Ministers for revised hydropower production is: 1075 MW in June, 1250 MW in July, 1112 MW in August, 794 MW in September, and 609 MW in October.  ------------------------------- FUEL FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION -------------------------------  14.  (C) The Minister of Electricity (ME) said he was still short $50 million for purchasing fuel for the summer electricity program. The MOO told the Ministers he had signed contracts for importing the fuel (gas-oil) for the summer electrical generation program and had paid an initial payment of $15 million, but the contracts had been initiated to support fuel imports.  --------------------------------------------- ------- AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING OF NATIONAL ENERGY COMMITTEE --------------------------------------------- -------  15.  (C) The DPM said the next meeting of the NEC would discuss the smuggling of oil from the ports along the Shatt al Arab.  The DPM said, in his opinion, "oil was being stolen" and the NEC needed to assess Iraqi ports and oil export procedures to prevent smuggling.  ------- COMMENT -------  16.  (C) COMMENT:  DPM Chalabi appears to continue to show firm leadership of the NEC.  The consensus of the Ministers to support the protection of the oil infrastructure demonstrates the criticality oil revenues to the government of Iraq. The NEC meeting highlighted the continuing tension between MOF and MOD over funding issues.  The Ministers differed on how to support the Iraqi military and were concerned their investments in the security forces were not being paid back with adequate security improvements across Iraq. This meeting showed a higher level of concern than previous NEC meetings on the shortcomings in oil infrastructure security and the resulting lack of oil export income for Iraq.  17.  (C) Water resources could be of increasing contention between several actors.  The increased flow of water negotiated with Turkey by Iraq would lead to more electricity in Iraq, if it gets through Syria.  The Ministers appeared to have a real concern that this could be an item of dispute between Syria and Iraq in the near future.  The allocation of water for electricity versus agriculture is another internal question for Iraq, which has not been fully discussed.  This could lead to the real issue of food versus electricity in Iraq. END COMMENT. SATTERFIELD Satterfield 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002383  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2015 TAGS: MOPS, PHUM, PINS, PTER, XF, Human Rights, Security SUBJECT: US FORCES IN BAGHDAD IMPLEMENT LARGE-SCALE HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVES  REF: SECSTATE 99939  Classified By: Classified by Political-Military Counselor Ronald E. Neumann for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (SBU) The U.S. Army's Third Infantry Division (3ID) is running a comprehensive program of practical rule-of-law initiatives to train, monitor, and encourage human rights practices amongst its Iraqi Security Force (ISF) partners in Baghdad (a program list is provided in para 8).  Both Post and MNF-I have commenced work with various partners in the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) to establish the legal bases of existing and future ISF detentions. We have found ITG officials eager to deconflict currently contentious and ambiguous detention authorities and ensure that clear lines of accountability exist.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  2.  (SBU) Recent international criticism of ISF human rights practices has alleged violations in two primary areas: first, physical abuse - ranging from overcrowding to repeated beatings and torture - of individuals detained by Iraqi MoD and MoI security forces, and secondly, the large- scale practice of detention without appropriate judicial oversight.  3.  (SBU) (Note: Under the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), Iraqi Police (IPS) reporting to MoI are authorized to "detain" individuals post-arrest, but are normally required to bring the detainee before an investigative judge within 24 hours; the TAL does not provide either Iraqi Army and National Guard troops reporting to MoD or Iraqi Police reporting to MOI a right of extra-judicial detention similar to that enjoyed by the Coalition under the terms of UNSCR 1546, although it can be argued that the TAL may permit a form of security detention subject to judicial review.)  4.  (U) 3ID has recorded 57 allegations of physical abuse of civilians in ISF custody since it arrived in Baghdad on February 27, 2005, and has substantiated 27 reports through the physical examination of detainees. In response, the division has designed and staffed a large-scale rule of law initiative, described in para 8 below, aimed at training and monitoring good human rights practice in ISF facilities across Baghdad.  5.  (SBU) At the same time, various ITG ministries are examining ways to establish clear legal authorities for the temporary ISF detentions necessitated by the growing and increasingly independent Iraqi role in fighting the insurgency.  Iraqi officials have expressed keen interest in "normalizing" the current ISF detention situation, in which military imperatives and civilian criminal codes met imperfectly Post plans to enagage in this dialogue, as requested in Reftel.  --------------------------------- COALITION MONITORING OF ISF ABUSE ---------------------------------  6.  (U) All MNF-I units in the field are instructed to take all necessary action to stop or prevent any observed or suspected physical or mental abuse (defined as "any physical or mental abuse that poses a threat of serious injury or death"), and to report incidents rapidly up the chain of Coalition command.  These are then reported by formal letter from the Commanding General, MNF-I to the relevant Iraqi Minister (Interior or Defense).  7.  (U) In Baghdad, 3ID offers detainees alleging abuse by ISF an extensive medical examination.  Abuse allegations are investigated by a 3ID Commander's Inquiry;  the 3ID Chief Counsel, Detainee Operations (CCDO), maintains a database on investigation results, which are reported monthly to the 3ID division commander.  When abuse allegations are substantiated after investigation, 3ID engages ISF unit commanders and presses them to cease abusive practices.  ----------------------------------- 3ID TRAINING INITIATIVES IN BAGHDAD -----------------------------------  8.  (U) Currently, 3ID units reinforce human rights training with programs designed to help inexperienced ISF officers institute protocols and procedures that meet internationally-accepted human rights standards:  OPERATION EN-SANIA (Humanity), managed in conjunction with the Iraqi Bar and Baghdad Law School, acquaints Iraqi Armed Forces (IAF) personnel with human rights principles, encourages senior IAF leadership to prioritize the protection of prisoners, and provides practical training to individual Iraqi interrogators and guards.  Training has been provided for over 80 interrogators and facility personnel; 3ID intends to extend this training to the Iraqi Police Service.  OPERATION HAMMURABI II aims to strengthen the Iraqi court and police systems by training Iraqi Security Forces in non-coercive investigation procedures.  THE PROVOST MARSHALL'S OFFICE TRAINING PROGRAM, a 40-hour course focused on the 1st Iraqi Army Brigade (1/6 IA), teaches basic military detention facility operations with an emphasis on professionalism and proper treatment of prisoners.  JUDGE ADVOCATE (JA) TRAINING puts 3ID JAs together with their ISF counterparts to train new recruits in human rights practices.  THE INFORMATION OUTREACH CAMPAIGN encourages reliance upon the Iraqi judicial system as a guardian of human rights. 3ID distributes a booklet, "Principles of Human Rights," and other human rights training material to the Iraqi Army and Police.   The campaign also uses TV and radio to promote the Iraqi judicial system as the single legitimate means of prosecuting insurgents.  A local radio show, "The Citizen and the Law," will also promote the rule of law by answering ordinary Iraqis' legal questions.  ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH THE MiTT TEAMS:  3ID gives all ISF recruits a packet of basic legal instruction on the laws of war, the rules of engagement, and human rights.  A Military Training Team (MiTTs) JA works with the 6th IA Division JAG and other command staff to emphasize prisoner protections and the rule of law.  3ID is also using its MiTTs to institute ISF reporting and investigation of incidents of abuse.  GUIDANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DETENTION OPERATIONS: 3ID is urging 1/6 IA towards acceptance of a Model Apprehension and Detention Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).  The SOPs provide for the humane treatment of all prisoners, quick and effective processing from point of capture until eventual incarceration, and detailed guidance on detention operations.  ---------------------------------- ESTABLISHMENT OF LEGAL AUTHORITIES ----------------------------------  9.  (SBU) The ITG has expressed increasing awareness that the growing Iraqi role in conducting military operations has strained its current legal and physical capacity for detention. Increasingly, Iraqi military forces retain custody of prisoners arrested during kinetic operations because Iraqi Police holding cells are full; IPS, in turn, complain that intimidation and weak court infrastructure make it hard to locate investigative judges with the authority to issue detention orders.  10.  (SBU) The ITG is showing growing interest in practical initiatives to increase correctional and judicial capacity. The Minister of Interior has recently requested Coalition assistance in procuring additional temporary holding cells; the Iraqi Army is working with 3ID and the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) to bring investigative judges directly to MoD holding facilities to conduct hearings.  ------- COMMENT ------- 11.  (C) The security mechanisms of intimidation, abuse, and disregard for independent judicial authority established under the former regime have shaped the basic worldview of millions of Iraqis, including members of the current ISF.  We will see more allegations of abuse committed by ISF, and expect the number of incident reports to rise with the deployment of MiTTs armed with stringent reporting requirements to ISF units.  12.  (C) However, the care and energy put by 3ID and other MNF-I components into practical human rights training and monitoring programs gives cause for hope, as does the interest of the ITG in establishing a clear legal basis for ISF detentions. Post and MNF-I intend to work these two critical elements of good rule-of-law practice in tandem, and will provide regular updated reporting on ISF and ITG progress. Satterfield 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002388  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: MOPS, PHUM, PINS, PTER, XF, Detainees, Human Rights SUBJECT: UPDATE ON PALESTINIAN DETAINEES IN COALITION CUSTODY  REF: A. BAGHDAD 246       B. JERUSALEM 196  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (SBU) In this cable, Post provides an update to Reftel A, which was sent in January 2005 in response to AmConsul Jerusalem's request in Reftel B for information on the status of Palestinian security internees held by Coalition Forces inside Iraq.  As of May 31, 2005, Multi-National Force - Iraq held eight identified Palestinians; their individual status is detailed below.  Unless otherwise indicated, all information may be passed to Palestinian Authority officials.  2.  (U) The files of security internees are subject to review every 90-180 days by the Combined Review and Release Board, an Iraqi-majority panel staffed by representatives from the Iraqi Ministries of Justice, Interior, and Human Rights, as well as MNF-I.  The CRRB currently approves 40% of the cases it reviews for release, with the remaining 60% recommended for continued detention on the assessment that release would pose an imperative threat to Iraqi security.  All detainees remain subject to criminal prosecution by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq.  ------------ CASE DETAILS ------------  3.  (SBU) Mohammed Saleh Hassan (ISN No. 150447) was detained by MNF-I on September 4, 2003; Mr. Hassan was in possession of explosives at the time of his apprehension, and is believed to have been involved in attacks on Coalition Forces. (Do not pass this sentence: the FBI has placed a hold on this detainee due to active interrogation.)  4.  (SBU) Marwan Helmi Saeed Dabhof (ISN No. 162141) was detained by MNF-I on July 16, 2004 due to his involvement in a terrorist cell manufacturing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) and linked to al-Qaeda. On February 9, 2005, the Board (see para (2) recommended Mr. Dabhof for continued internment as an ongoing security threat.  5.  (SBU) Awad Ahmed Awad Sahknini (ISN No. 166831) was detained by MNF-I on November 24, 2005 based on information suggesting that he was a high-level terrorist cell organizer associated with Tawheet al-Jihad. He was recommended for continued internment by the Board on April 5, 2005.  6.  (SBU) Jayyab Mahmoud Hasan Ehmedat (ISN No. 106593) has been recommended for release.  His file has been sent to CENTCOM for approval, a process which normally takes four- to-six weeks; should CENTCOM concur, he will be free to depart Iraq voluntarily, or to seek the permission of the Iraqi government for his release inside Iraq.  7.  (SBU) Ahmed Hussain Yousif (ISN No. 107298) was detained on April 23, 2003 for illegal entry into Iraq and engagement in anti-Coalition activities. He was recommended for continued internment by the Board on January 5, 2005, and is currently facing trial at the Central Criminal Court.  8.  (SBU) Ibraheem Mahmood Mohammed (ISN No. 154750) was detained on December 5, 2003 in possession of blank passports and bomb-making equipment. He was recommended by the Board for continued internment on April 15, 2005, and is currently being considered for prosecution by the Central Criminal Court.  9.  (SBU) Mohammed Awad Ahmed (ISN No. 166826) was detained with seven others (five wounded) during fighting in Fallujah on November 25, 2004.  He was found near a weapons stockpile, and his hands tested positive for gunpowder. The Board voted for continued internment on March 15, 2005.  10.  (SBU) Osama Feysa Mohammed (ISN No. 172700) was detained on May 2, 2005 during a targeted raid on his cousin's house.  His file has been sent to the Commanding General of Task Force 134 for consideration for expedited release.  11.  (SBU) Coalition Forces have no record of holding a Palestinian detainee with a name similar to "Ahmad Badran Fares Abueid". The identification number provided by the Palestinian Authority for this detainee, 106319, belongs to an Iraqi national named Abbas Mahmud al-Azawi, resident in Diyala Province, detained April 14, 2003 and released thirteen days later.

Neumann for Reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi outlined his top three priorities to PolMilCouns on June 3.  He claims to be engaging MoD Sadoun Dulaimi on improving MOD staff to combat corruption and replacing Army officers in select units with locally born commanders.  Chalabi also briefed his position on the stand-up of the pipeline security forces and his outreach efforts to engage Sunni Sheikhs.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Claiming he was close to the new Minister of Defense, Chalabi described Dulaimi as "beleaguered" as he grapples with the level of corruption in the ministry.  Chalabi suggested recruiting professional technocrats to fill mid-level ministry slots.  He pushed for drawing on the cadre of USG-trained Iraqis who received DoD training before the war.  While he did not say so, we suspect many are members of Chalabi's political party.  He also recommended replacing the commanding officers of select brigade and battalions in some of the most troubled areas with officers native to the region.  Chalabi believes this could temper the insurgency. PolMilCouns noted our strong view that professional military leaders should not be changed for political reasons.  Chalabi said he was not advocating a purge and hoped we could talk in detail.  Subsequently, the Minister of Defense made clear to PolMilCouns that he has no intention of changing commanders for political purposes.  He said Iraq will have problems to sustain financially the current size of the military the U.S. and Iraq are standing up.  3. (C) Chalabi noted the country had lost $1 billion trying to protect the pipelines since liberation. He just returned from Kirkuk to survey several strategic (and heavily targeted) portions of the line and appeared confident that current interministerial planning for a new security forces would be successful.  Gathering intelligence in the areas along the pipeline were vital to its protection.  He mentioned the Minister of State for National Security al Anzi had proposed setting up a new intelligence agency, firmly under Anzi's control.  Chalabi reported Anzi has approached the Prime Minister for $40 million to fund the effort. Chalabi registered his firm opposition to this plan, but appeared unsure whether he alone could block it.  Chalabi added that INIS Director Shahwani is making the situation worse by refusing to show up at important meetings or deal with the Government.  4. (C) Chalabi claimed he conducts his own campaign of Sunni outreach, meeting with many individuals privately.  He asked Deputy Prime Minister Abd Mutlak al Jaboori to accompany him on his recent trip to Kirkuk, "his neighborhood" according to Chalabi.  The purpose was twofold:  to bolster his efforts to reach out to Sunni tribal leaders and to use such contacts for the gathering of better intelligence on those targeting Iraqi's oil infrastructure.  Despite his well known credibility problems with the Sunnis, Chalabi asserted that reconciling them would be among his primary tasks.  5.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 002392  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2015 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, KDEM, KISL, IZ, IR SUBJECT: CHARGE DISCUSSES IRAQI POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES WITH DEPUTY PRESIDENT MAHDI  Classified By: Classified by Charge d,Affaires David Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (SBU) CDA and DCM met with Deputy President Adil abd- al-Mahdi on May 31 to discuss local politics and international issues.  ---------------------------- IRAQI POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS ----------------------------  3. (C) After opening pleasantries, Mahdi noted that he has devoted a lot of time over the past three weeks to Kurdish issues.  He said the agreement giving Massoud Barzani a four-year term as President of the Kurdish Regional Government offers grounds to hope for a period of relative calm.  Mahdi cautioned, though, that agreement was possible because discussion of a number of sensitive issues, such as the flag and the status of the Kurdish and Arabic languages, has been suspended for now.  4. (C) On Sunni outreach and the constitution-drafting process, Mahdi said the ITG must maintain a delicate balance.  On the one hand, it is essential to show respect for the Sunni community's position and equities.  However, this must be done without undercutting the legitimacy of the elected Transitional National Assembly (TNA), particularly its Sunni members.  5. (C) Charge's expression of regret for the arrest of Iraqi Islamic Party leader Mohsen Abdul-Hamid elicited little reaction from Mahdi.  The Deputy President calmly took on board the explanation that the detention resulted from inadvertence and that coalition forces were fine-tuning their "hands-off" list to prevent future such occurrences.  ------------------ NO IRANIAN AMNESTY ------------------  6. (C) Responding to a question from the Charge, Mahdi said that the proposed liberation of Iranian prisoners in Iraq will not take place.  Although Prime Minister Jaafari did indeed sign a letter authorizing a general amnesty for detained Iranians, he lacks the authority to implement this promise on his own.  According to Mahdi, the Presidency Council rejected the proposal; Charge noted that this was an encouraging example of how that body can use its powers responsibly.  --------------------------------------- PREPARING FOR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES ---------------------------------------  7. (C) Charge reminded Mahdi of the full slate of conferences facing the IIG in June and July:  the EU-US conference in Brussels, the US-Iraq Joint Economic Committee, and the IRFFI donors' conference.  Charge also underlined the importance of using these fora to present a coherent reconstruction and development strategy and to demonstrate tangible progress in reforming the policy distortions such as fuel and food subsidies that hamstring the capacity of the Iraqi economy to sustain economic growth.  8. (C) Mahdi concurred in the value of these meetings for highlighting the progress Iraq has made and its continuing need for assistance.  Key economic policymakers such as Ali Allawi, Mahdi's successor as Finance Minister, and Central Governor Shabibi are fully committed to the need for economic reform and are explaining the need for these steps to other new members of the Cabinet who have not previously focused on these issues.  9. (U) REO Hillah, Basrah, Kirkuk, and Mosul Minimize considered. Satterfield 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002393  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ECPS, ECON, IZ, Media SUBJECT: INITIAL CALL ON THE NEW IRAQI MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION.  REF: A) STATE 30930      B) BAGHDAD 2191      C) Department/Baghdad O/I (06/02/2005)  1.(SBU) SUMMMARY: Iraqi Minister of Communications, Dr. Jowan Masum, told us May 30she is anxious to get a date from the CEO of the National Communications and Media Commission (NCMC) for a joint press conference between the Ministry of Communications and the NCMC.  She requested assistance in resolving the closing of an internal access road to the MOC building.  She also requested assistance with the Project Contracting Office to expedite the contract award for the construction of a new post office. Masum announced that she had accepted the International Telecommunication Union's invitation for Iraq to host a 2009 technology conference and of her intent to resolve Iraq's ITU membership dues arrearages. She noted that all previous MOC unlicensed Wireless Local Loop (WLL) projects are halted until the licensing issues with the NCMC are resolved. Masum stated that MCI offered to "gift" their system to the MOC.  Masum noted the difficulty of transitioning current employees in the state owned landline system to the private sector because of job security concerns.  Masum suggested that the new mobile licensees would be limited to entities comprised of 10 percent or less government ownership. Masum stated her intent to sign all the infrastructure initiatives left by the previous Minister, but that funding them was difficult as the previous Minister returned all the MOC funds to the Ministry of Finance.  Masum also stated her intent to restructure the state owned telephone company into wholesale and retail entities.  END SUMMARY  2.(U) IRMO Deputy Director and Director of Operations MG Heine, IRMO Senior Consultant for Communications, and ECONOFF met with the new Iraqi Minister of Communications, Dr. Jowan Masum, on May 30, 2005.  -------------------------------- JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH NCMC --------------------------------  3.(SBU) Masum said she was anxious to get a date from Siyamend Othman, CEO of the Iraqi National Communications and Media Commission (NCMC), for a joint press conference between MOC and NCMC.  She informed us that the press conference would serve as the formal and public transfer of all spectrum and licensing responsibilities and equipment, from the MOC to the NCMC.  In addition, she stated that she received several complaints on Iraqna service and that the press conference would definitively establish that the NCMC has sole authority over mobile carriers.  Masum showed us a poster she printed up for the press conference.  We offered our assistance in helping with the press conference and d extended the offer from the US Embassy Public Affairs Section to conduct media training to prepare for the press conference.  ------------------------ NEW POST OFFICE BUILDING ------------------------  4.(SBU) Masum stated that her immediate priority is to award a contract for the construction of a new post office, the first in Iraq for many years that will be built from the ground up.  It is modeled after a US post office. Masum, who previously worked at PCO as an Operations Manager, said she had heard that PCO is eliminating the 'quick procurement' option that allowed projects costing under $1 Million to bypass the usual RFP process.  She is concerned that the RFP process will take months and that in the interim she will lose the land. She stated that the contractor for the project has been identified and is ready to start.  She requested our assistance in expediting the resolution.  -------------------------------------- ITU 2009 CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN IRAQ --------------------------------------  5.(SBU) Masum informed us that the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) asked Iraq to hold the 2009 ITU technology conference.  Masum stated that she accepted the offer and would like to hold the conference at the Mamoon switch site, the rebuilding of which is currently out for bid and scheduled to be completed in 2 years.  She explained that Mamoon is a Baghdad landmark that has been used by Iraqis for many years as a recreation site and that its needle tower can be seen for miles around.  She also noted that a large park once surrounded the Mamoon building and stated her intent to bring back the park and connect it by footpath to another park nearby.  She plans to ensure that the rebuilding plans facilitate the hosting of the ITU conference.  -------------- ITU ARREARAGES --------------  6. (SBU) Masum said she is ready to make the initial payment of a proposed 5-year payment plan to the ITU in n order to begin the process of curing an 18-year lapse by Iraq in paying its dues (REF A).  The first payment will reinstate Iraq's membership in the ITU and begin the process in seeking forbearance of approximately $600,000 in accrued interest (about one-third of GOI's indebtedness of $1,962,982.60 Swiss francs as of October 29,2004). She stated that she has the funds to make the first payment and would do so upon receipt of the Repayment Agreement from ECONOFF. We offered our assistance in providing her with the Repayment Agreement and facilitating contact with the ITU.  NOTE: Subsequent to this meeting, we provided Masum with the information from REF C, and she has begun follow-up with the ITU.  END NOTE.  ----------------- MILITARY SPECTRUM -----------------  7.(SBU) Masum stated that she met with the Minister Of Defense and informed them that the military telecommunications systems need to be on the military spectrum band.  She noted that LTG Petreaus was present at the meeting.   --------------------------- UNLICENSED MOC WLL PROJECTS ---------------------------  8.(SBU) Masum said she has halted work on all current Wireless Local Loop projects initiated by MOC, under the previous Minister, until the licensing issue with the NCMC is resolved.  She noted that there were several projects at various stages of completion and it is her intent to license them before any work is resumed.  ------------------------ HIRING OF ITPC EMPLOYEES ------------------------  9.(SBU) Masum noted the difficulty in getting current ITPC employees to accept jobs in the private sector because of their concerns over job security and the loss of pensions and benefits.  She explained that employees want a letter from the MOC before joining the private sector, guaranteeing them a MOC position and a reinstitution of the pension in the event private industry positions are unsuccessful.  She also noted that she was going to end the current practice of guaranteeing jobs to graduates of the e College of Technology.  She stated that if positions were open, for which graduates were qualified, they would be welcome at MOC, but otherwise they were to look to the private sector for employment.  ------------------------ MCI OPERATED USG NETWORK -------------------------  10.(SBU) Masum said that MCI informed her that they would be "gifting" the MCI USG network to the ITPC, the government owned landline telephone company, which operates under MOC authority and direction.  She further stated that MCI invited her to Jordan at the end of June to begin discussing the "concept of granting the system" to ITPC.  ----------------------------- INTERCONNECTION WITH THE ITPC -----------------------------  11.(SBU) Masum noted several times in the meeting that interconnection and roaming among the mobile carriers and the ITPC are essential for good service in Iraq.  She acknowledged that the NCMC had jurisdiction over the issue and that the ITPC would be working closely with the NCMC.   ------------------------ MOBILE LICENSING TENDERS ------------------------  12.(SBU) Masum raised the issue of whether the new mobile license tenders would prohibit any entities that are comprised of more than 10 percent government ownership, from bidding in the upcoming mobile licensing tenders.  She stated that the current mobile licensees were restricted in that manner and that it would be wise to continue the practice.  She noted that there was still some confusion among carriers as to who had jurisdiction over the tender process and she has been referring potential candidates to the NCMC and the NCMC website.  -------------------------- INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVES --------------------------  13.(SBU) Masum said she plans to sign Tenders 13, 14, 21, 48 and 51, and that Tender 52 was final, with the award going to Marconi. She noted that former Minister al-Hakim returned all the money from the MOC budget to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), forcing her to go to the MOF repeatedly y on a project-by-project basis to get funding.  NOTE: This is required by Iraq's budget law.  END NOTE. She spoke at some length on the international connectivity project, which requires investing in a submarine fiber optic network and of her involvement in determining the cable landing sites.  She will be leaving for the UAE in June to begin negotiations on interconnection and tariffs.  14.(SBU) She questioned NCMC's CEO demand that there be a revenue sharing mechanism with the NCMC on the submarine fiber optic network.  She stated her belief that it was inappropriate for an independent agency to enter into revenue sharing agreements, that all the work in the past 14 months on the project had been done by MOC, that the market should dictate prices, and that revenue sharing by governments would distort that pricing. She requested our assistance in discussing this issue with Othman and, in particular, the role of an independent regulator.  ----------------- UNIVERSAL SERVICE -----------------   15.(SBU) Masum agreed with ECONOFF that a universal service policy and program needed to be in place to increase penetration in rural and high cost areas.  ------------------ ITPC RESTRUCTURING ------------------  16.(SBU) Masum said she plans to restructure the ITPC into wholesale and retail entities.  She also stated that the State Company for Internet Service (SCIS), created by the former MOC Minister, would be dissolved and folded into the wholesale entity as it housed and separated the most experienced data personnel from the rest of the company. We explained that the formation of SCIS was designed to work with IRMO Office of Communications on the IRFF funded Wireless Broadband project (WBB).  She explained that the current ITPC and SCIS data experts could take on the WBB project, once those entities were combined.  She stated she would seek the required approval from the Ministry of Planning for the ITPC restructuring. She asked for assistance in determining the role and scope of the e "Italian Project," which is designed to provide similar services to the WBB, and which is being directed by the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Joint Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces discovered the body of  Al-Anbar Governor, Raja Nawaf Farhan May 29.  The Anbar Provincial Council met June 1 in a special session and selected current PC Chairman, Engineer Ma'moun Sami Rasheed, as the new governor.  Former Governor Fassal Nejris Al-Ghaoud claimed he remains Governor of Anbar.  END SUMMARY.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  2. (C) The Al Anbar Provincial Council (PC) selected Raja Nawaf Farhan as the Governor of Anbar Province on May 5. Within days, insurgents/terrorists revealed they had kidnapped him en route to the provincial capital Ramadi. (NOTE:  The governor served as mayor of Al-Qa'im, a city located on the western-most part of the province, approximately 20 km from the Syrian border.  He had taken an active role against insurgent elements in the area.  END NOTE.)  3. (C) Joint Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces conducted cordon and search operations against a suspected terrorist safe house in the Rawah area on May 29.  Iraqi soldiers fought side-by-side with U.S. forces in the operation.  The Governor was found dead inside the destroyed building, where he had been chained to a propane tank.  Four foreign fighters were killed in the operation:  three Saudis and one Moroccan; two Syrians, an Algerian and a Jordanian were detained.  ---------------------------- COUNCIL SELECTS NEW GOVERNOR ----------------------------  4. (C) The PC met June 1 in a special session to discuss next steps; twenty-seven members attended the meeting. They unanimously agreed to move ahead with the selection of a new governor, electing current PC Chairman, Ma'moun Sami Rasheed (biographic information -- para 8).  He was the only candidate considered for the job; a replacement PC Chairman has not yet been identified by council members.  Current Deputy Governor Taleb Ibrahim will continue in that role.  ---------------------------- FORMER GOVERNOR CLAIMS TITLE ----------------------------  5. (C) In Baghdad, ex-governor Fassal al-Ghaoud, attended a May 31 meeting hosted by Minister for Provincial Affairs, Sa'ad Naif Hardan, according to Anbar Provincial Council Secretary Sheikh Hussein Zubaer Thelej who also attended.  SIPDIS He reported that Fassal (once again) declared himself to be the legitimate Governor of Anbar Province, and he intended to establish a provincial administrative office in the Babil Hotel in Baghdad.  Fassal added that he would not return to Ramadi until the Marines left the city; he "ordered" Deputy Governor Taleb Ibrahim barred from entering Ramadi or its Government Center.  According to Sheikh Hussein, the Minister of State and several others in attendance welcomed Fassal's statement and plans, while others expressed puzzlement and disbelief.  Sheikh Hussein told Marine officers in Fallujah that he had asked Fassal if he wanted to settle this dispute with "fists" or by the "law."  Fassal chose "law".  The Sheikh said he then began to read from the TAL and CPA 71 to make the point that the PC's election of a new Governor had been in accordance with the law.   After the meeting, said Hussein, several Iraqi military officers in attendance (apparently at Fassal and Minister's invitation) thanked him for citing the law, of which they were not aware.  6. (C) Comment.  The quick election of Ma'moun as the new governor represents a positive step; any gap in continuity in provincial leadership would add to Anbar's ongoing governance challenges.  Ma'moun has already established a credible and effective working relationship with the Coalition in his capacity as PC Chairman.  He proved to be an adept facilitator at the PRDC's first meeting May 29. (septel).  7. (C) Fassal Al-Ghaoud's positioning and antics in Baghdad are not surprising, but could lead to more substantive problems if left unaddressed by the ITG.  (NOTE: Fassal claims the January 30 the Provincial Council elections were invalid and has contested since then the PC's legal standing.  End Note.)  High-level ITG engagement regarding Fassal's claims would help reaffirm the legitimacy of new Governor Ma'moun's status as the troubled province's new leader.  8. (C) Biographic information on Ma'moun Sami Rasheed: Civil Engineer, leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Al- Anbar; is a devout Muslim.  Served on the Provincial Council since 2004 (including during the CPA-era) and has been acting President of the PC since March 2005.  Ma'moun is charismatic, intelligent and well spoken; he has developed an effective working relationship with coalition representatives in the province.  9.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002395  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2015 TAGS: MOPS, PTER, PGOV, PHUM, XF, Detainees, Terrorism, Security SUBJECT: IST ISSUES WARRANTS FOR TWENTY HVDS APPROVED FOR RELEASE  REF: BAGHDAD 2164  Classified By: Political-Military Counselor Ronald Neumann for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1. (S) The Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) has issued arrest warrants for twenty High-Value Detainees (HVDs) whom the USG has approved for release, and against whom the IST had previously indicated it did not intend to pursue charges. Post remains concerned that political pressure may have influenced the IST's sudden issuance of warrants for these HVDs on the eve of their release. All twenty remain temporarily in USG custody pending resolution of this issue.  2.  (S) In two cases, the IST has now shared new evidence of criminal activity that appears to constitute sufficient grounds for proceeding. The Regime Crimes Liaison Office (RCLO) will continue working closely with the IST to ensure that the remaining arrest warrants are supported by what the IST could reasonably consider "a reliable body of evidence that tends to show that the suspect committed a crime". The RCLO will also work with the IST to ensure that any arrests are in accordance with IST statutes and rules, fundamental due process, and US international law and treaty obligations.  3. The IST's ability to meet this standard is seen as critical by Embassy Pol-Mil and MNF-I, as we have a strong interest in ensuring that the USG does not in future find itself in the awkward position of cooperating with Iraqi arrests of USG detainees that are or appear to be politically-motivated, or that suggest that these detainees may not receive impartial treatment by the tribunal.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  4. (S) Twenty HVDs approved for release by the USG have seen their release dates delayed for as long as eight months at the repeated request of the Iraqi Government. PM Allawi argued in autumn and winter 2004-2005 that unacceptable political consequences would result from HVD releases during operations in Fallujah and the run-up to Iraqi elections. We acceded to Iraqi requests for delay, on the understanding that a unilateral USG release of high- profile former Ba'athists would likely have a significant impact on Iraqi pre-election politics.  5.  (S) Post, aware that the continued detention of these individuals raised significant legal and ethical issues for MNF-I and the USG, approached the ITG on this subject as a matter of priority upon the seating of a new Iraqi government, and informed PM Ja'afari and the judges of the IST in mid-May that MNF-I intended to proceed with twenty HVD releases soon. In response, PM Ja'afari's office replied (see Reftel) that "all" HVDs are known to be guilty of war crimes, and that all will be arrested by Iraqi Police if released by MNF-I.  6.  (S) On various occasions between July 31, 2004 and November 10, 2004, the RCLO had consulted the chief investigative judge of the IST as to whether the IST possessed evidence of crimes involving these twenty (and other) HVDs. Based on the IST's representation that it did not possess evidence against these twenty that would support the issuance of arrest warrants, RCLO recommended conditional release of thirteen HVDs in July 2004, four in October 2004, and three in November 2004.)  7.  (S) However, when MNF-I made known its intent to release these twenty HVDs known mid-May, a number of IST investigative judges objected on the grounds that they had either never been personally consulted or had not been consulted in recent months regarding these releases. (Note: the IST was formed between July and November 2004, and some judges had not yet begun investigations at the time these releases were approved.)  8.  (S) Several IST judges reacted to the news of impending HVD releases by issuing arrest warrants, including fifteen warrants of particular concern issued by the judge investigating crimes of "Wasting the National Wealth" under Article 14 of the IST statute. RCLO informed the IST of MNF-I's concern as to whether these warrants are based on "a reliable body of evidence that tends to show that the suspect committed a crime".  9.  (S) One investigative judge has also issued eighty-four detention orders covering most HVDs as well as some individuals not in USG custody. RCLO has expressed concerns to the IST about whether these detention orders comply with the IST statutes and rules. The IST chief prosecutor has said he will appeal these detention orders prior to service, and that he is reasonably confident they will be overturned on appeal and dismissed.  10.  (S) In addition, the IST has issued an arrest warrant for former HVD Ghazi al-Ubaydi (Blacklist #51), released by MNF-I with the permission of PM Allawi on humanitarian grounds in April 2005 due to his impending death from colon cancer.  The PM's spokesman, Laith Kubba, has informed the press that Ghazi's release was a "mistake in the justice system".  11.  (S) The IST has asked RCLO to schedule initial appearances for a number of HVDs, including the twenty now approved for release by the USG.  At these initial hearings,the IST would normally serve an arrest warrant and inform the HVD in question of his or her rights; after reviewing the HVD's file, the judge would be in a position to issue detention orders which would result in the "transfer" of an HVD from USG to Iraqi legal custody. Once this occurs, MNF-I is no longer in a position to effect these detainees' legal release.  ------------------ CURRENT ASSESSMENT ------------------  12.  (S) In response to queries from RCLO, the IST has shared evidence against two HVDs whose initial appearances had been scheduled for mid-June, Hikmat al-Azzawi (Blacklist #28) and Issam Rashid Huaish (Blacklist #237), on charges of "Wasting the Wealth of the State".  The evidence centers on string of memos authorizing Huaish (the manager of the Central Bank of Iraq) to transfer $920 million USD and 90 million Euros from the bank's vaults to al-Azzawi (the Deputy Prime Minister) on March 19, 2003. The IST believes that the documents are genuine; this is a fact to be established at trial. Based on this evidence, the investigative hearing will go forward.  13.  (S) The RCLO has also inquired about the evidence against Fadil Sulfaij Muhammad al-Azawi (Blacklist #100) on charges of "Crimes against Humanity"; Mr. al-Azawi was also scheduled for initial hearing in mid-June. The IST has not produced a similar quality of evidence related to these charges. (The IST has noted that Mr. al-Azawi served as the head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in the 1980s, and that allegations have been made that he directed political assassinations; however, it has not presented specifics.) Mr. al-Azawi's hearing has been postponed. RCLO will work with the IST to identify additional evidence in Mr. al-Azawi's and similar cases, if such evidence exists.  14.  (S) While the standard of evidence required under Iraqi law for arrest or pre-trial detention is relatively low by US standards, the USG has significant legal and policy equities in assuring itself that any Iraqi arrest and detention of HVDs in USG custody is based on sufficient evidence and is consistent with Iraqi law and international standards.  15.  (S) Embassy Pol-Mil and MNF-I also feel that we have a clear interest in establishing that Iraqi decisions regarding arrest in individual HVD cases are not influenced by the hothouse political climate surrounding the trial and rehabilitation of former Ba'athists and relatives and associates of Saddam's regime.  16.  (S) RCLO believes that in most cases, the appropriate way to deal with an arrest warrant or detention order that may not be based on sufficient evidence is through the due process afforded under the statute and rules of the IST. If, at an HVDs initial appearance, the investigative judge orders the HVD detained, the prosecutor, defense counsel, or the defendant may file a motion with the appellate chamber of the IST challenging the sufficiency of the evidence To date, we have seen no evidence that the appellate chamber will be fair and impartial.  17.  (S) Nevertheless, should we find ourselves in a situation in which an IST investigative judge insists on proceeding with the service of an arrest warrant and an initial appearance for a HVD under circumstances in which it does not seem objectively reasonable to conclude that the warrant is based on "a reliable body of evidence that tends to show that a suspect committed a crime", we will have to decide to what extent this affects our willingness to cooperate with the IST in that case.

"Resistance by animals and water melon" (Asharq Al- Awsat, 6/5) B. "Citizens and the political program" (Al-Bayyan, 6/5)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Resistance by animals and water melon" (June 5)  Asharq Al-Awsat (independent, London-based, has wide circulation in Iraq) published a tenth-page editorial by Adnan Hussein about the recent militants' military styles in Iraq:  "Poisoning a watermelon to kill Iraqi soldiers at checkpoints is not resistance-it's murder. Booby-trapping a dog or a donkey with explosives does not represent honest principles. However, these actions are what characterize the current Iraqi resistance.  The most famous resistance movements in modern history include the Soviet resistance against the Nazis, the Vietnamese resistance against the American invasion, the Kurdish resistance in Iraq and the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation.   Although fundamentalists and extremists have distorted the Palestinian resistance, the Soviets did not behead Nazis and the Vietnamese resistance did not kidnap journalists and employees of international organizations. The Palestinian resistance, before extremists took over the movement, did not booby-trap cars or animals. Every Iraqi knows that the Kurdish resistance was a great example of a patriotic resistance.  It did not conduct sabotage or hurt citizens.  It treated its military prisoners nobly.  Making donkeys and dogs carry rockets in order to be detonated is a strong sign that the Iraqi resistance is finding it difficult to recruit new members.  Poisoning watermelons indicates that the Iraqi resistance suffers from a lack of supplies.  This also shows that its leaders are brutal criminals.  According to the latest statistics, in the last month the Iraqi resistance killed 672 Iraqis and wounded 1,174.  Most of their victims were women, children and the elderly.  Sheikh Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi has issued a historic Fatwa calling for murder of all these people under the pretext of the enemy's shields. Saddam's followers did not bother themselves to find a nationalistic or patriotic justification to shed Iraqi blood. They believe that Saddam's Qadissiya will continue to hurt the Iraqi people so that Iraq will be a land without inhabitants. Saddam first announced that belief to reporters 25 years ago.  The resistance of booby-trapped animals and poisonous watermelons has supporters.  These are the partners of those who booby-trap cars and call for the killing and beheading of Iraqis just because they are Iraqis."   B. "Citizens and the political program" (June 5)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with Islamic Dawa Party led by Ibrahim Al-Jafari) published a front-page editorial about the government's announced political program:  "The Prime Minister Ibrahim Al-Jafari announced the transitional government's political program in front of the National Assembly. This program addresses the needs and dreams of the Iraqi people.  It also compliments the accomplishments of Allawi's government.  The program discusses the security and political situations, in addition to the need for municipal services.  The government took a while to announce its political program.  This program did not restrict itself to determining the goals for the transitional period but it included solutions for current problems.   It was willing to work toward solutions to these problems despite the fact that the transitional government will only be in office a short time. The most important reason for applying the government's program is the call for the full cooperation between the Iraqi people and ministries, associations, and all government offices.  There must be full cooperation between all the national political parties and the government in order to support the political process.   This will benefit all the Iraqi people.  The success of the transitional government will reflect the success of the whole political process. If we get through the political process, we will be able to secure the country and stabilize it politically and economically.  Without this stability, we will not be able to start reconstruction.   On the other hand, to accomplish this program we need the Iraqi people to support it so that it will achieve their goals."   SATTERFIELD

(S) Summary: Post has been informed that the Government of Turkey wishes to extradite two security internees held by MNF-I inside Iraq, based on GOT suspicion of their involvement in terrorist bombings in Istanbul.  MNF-I is willing to transfer these detainees to Iraqi custody to permit an Iraqi extradition to Turkey; the ITG's views are unknown. The steps described in paras 5-6 seem, in Post's view, to be the most efficient route to extradition should the ITG be willing to accede to the Turkish request. End Summary.  2.  (S) Post and MNF-I have been informed that the GOT is seeking the extradition to Turkey of two detainees held by MNF-I inside Iraq, both suspected of criminal involvement in bombing attacks in Istanbul:  BURHAN KUS (ISN 166308), aka Burhan Jilal Hussein, DOB January 1, 1972, Turkish national;  SADETTIN ADKAS (ISN 16670), aka Mustafa abd Hamad, DOB July 1, 1989, Turkish national.  3.  (SBU) As a practical matter, both MNF-I and Iraqi concurrence is required for an extradition. MNF-I has no objection to transferring custody of these detainees to the ITG should the ITG wish to accede to a Turkish extradition request.  4.  (SBU) We understand, however, that the GOT has had difficulty locating a point-of-contact inside the ITG through which to request extradition, despite the agreement of both governments that an existing Iraqi- Turkish treaty regarding the Iraqi extradition of Turkish nationals remains in force.  5.  (SBU) Post recommends that the GOT present a formal extradition request to the Iraqi MFA, noting in the attached diplomatic note that a courtesy copy of the extradition request has been passed to the Chief Justice of Iraq. We then suggest that the GOT provide a copy of the extradition request to Post, which Post will pass directly to the Chief Justice.  6.  (SBU) Should Turkey's extradition request be approved by an Iraqi judge, Post will notify MNF-I, which will request permission from CENTCOM to transfer legal custody of these detainees to the ITG. MNF-I will retain physical custody of any detainees approved for extradition until arrangements have been made for their transport to Turkey.  7.  (SBU) The steps described in paras 5-6 may be passed by Embassy Ankara to the GOT if appropriate as a procedural recommendation for seeking extradition. Satterfield

The Transitional Administrative law (TAL) determined that date and all the political groups that participated in the process ratified it.  The Constitutional committee wants to convince the representatives of Sunni groups to participate in the drafting process so that nobody can refute the document's validity.  We must ensue that all Iraqi sects are represented in the constitutional committee.  Some groups have begun to demand that the constitutional committee be given more time.  This is to ensure that all Iraqi sects are represented. These groups call for postponement because they claim that it will ensure a wider representation in the constitutional committee.  We are going through an important and sensitive stage in our country's development.  We must have a wise vision. We must be thoughtful and practice self-denial because we are drafting the future for upcoming Iraqi generations."  B. "New page and an honest line" (June 6)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a fourth-page editorial by Ali Khalif about terrorism in Iraq:  "The terrorist operations in Iraq are criminal and brutal. We feel surprised when some groups try to call these operations the actions of a resistance. These groups claim that they are resistance fighters.  They accuse the groups that disagree with them of distorting their honorable resistance.  If these groups are so honorable, why don't they appear in public and explain their actions to the Iraqi people? The truth is that what happens in Iraq is terrorism and those who perpetrate these operations are terrorists. There are attempts in Iraq to call this terrorism a national resistance.  These groups contradict themselves because they say that attacking a U.S. military convoy is a patriotic deed. However, if they deliberately target civilians, they tell everybody that they didn't do it.  There is an important truth that everybody must realize.  What happens in Iraq is terrorism and it is against the political process. These terrorists don't want Iraq to move into the future.   There are patriotic people who wanted to participate in the political process and vote in the elections but they could not because terrorist groups threatened them. Hence, every Iraqi must call for unity.  There is no way to move backwards because Iraq has opened a new page and everybody must draw an honest line in that page in order to build our new Iraq."

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - USG DIST ONLY - NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION  1. (SBU) Iraqi Airways (IA), with assistance from the British Royal Air Force at Basrah Airport in Southern Iraq, conducted a test flight of their B727 passenger aircraft on May 31, 2005 from Baghdad International Airport (BIAP). This was followed up by the first passenger flight from Baghdad to Basrah, which returned on Saturday June 4, 2005. On board the inaugural flight was the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Salam Al-Maliki, along with 42 passengers.  The news media carried the event.  This is considered the first domestic flight by an Iraqi airline since Saddam Hussein was in power.  2. (SBU) Due to lack of infrastructure, financial and legal reasons, Iraqi Air is the product of a "wet lease" agreement between Iraqi Airways, Ministry of Transportation's State- Owned Enterprise (SOE) and an aviation company in Amman, Jordan.  All IA flights originate in Amman.  This flight is the first commercial charter connection to the Southern Iraqi city of Basrah, Iraq's second largest by population. According to press reports, IA will service Basrah three or four times a week.  IRMO Transportation representatives continue to work closely with the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) to ensure IA is following all the necessary security and flight request procedures for this route.  3.

Satterfield, Charge d'Affaires, f  or reasons 1.4. (b) and (d).  1. (C) Summary: Adnan Janabi, deputy chairman of the Constitution Committee and the leader of its effort to bring in Sunni Arabs, told Charge on June 6 that he expects to complete his assignment by the end of this week.  He is expanding the group of Sunni participants and has requested that it present its candidates in time for a Committee session on June 9.  Janabi said that the key sticking point is the number of Sunni Arabs to be added to the committee. The Kurds want to keep Sunni Arab representation below their own and some Sunni Arabs are pushing for as many as 40 percent of the body.  Janabi said he is pushing for 15 additional members.   He is looking for the USG to hang back so he can convince a suspicious Sunni Arab community that the constitution drafting process is going to be purely Iraqi. End summary.  2. (C) Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Adnan Janabi briefed the Charge June 6 on the status of efforts to expand Sunni Arab representation in the drafting process.  Charge expressed full USG support for his efforts to expand political participation in the process.  He reviewed the following key areas:  -- AN EVOLVING SUNNI ARAB CONFERENCE: Janabi said that the Sunni Arab outreach meeting last June 2 successfully brought together some fifty leaders from all walks of the Sunni Arab community.  The meeting effectively "re-established contact lines" with many disaffected Sunni Arabs, Janabi said.  He is now working to expand attendance for the June 9 meeting by bringing in more representatives from civil society and professional syndicates, particularly the Iraqi Lawyers' Union, which is headed by a Sunni Arab from Mosul.  Janabi said other Sunni Arab groups have also since asked to be included and he has agreed to add them all.  -- CHOOSING THE REPRESENTATIVES: Janabi said that Sunni Arabs from the conference he held would meet June 7 to come up with a list of at least half their candidates for positions on the constitution committee.  Janabi said he is pressing his colleagues on the committee itself to accept any names that come forward.  He said that some members have expressed reservations about allowing the appointment of "bloody Saddamist criminials."  Janabi said he has argued that the only legitimate restriction that can be put on Sunni Arab participants is that they comply with the TAL criteria, which forbid any high-ranking Ba'athist or criminal from serving on the TNA.  -- STATUS OF THE ADDED MEMBERS: Janabi said he believes the TNA will agree to pass a special motion welcoming additional Sunni Arabs to drafting process as equal members.  The motion will stop short of legally inducting them to the TNA, but it will give them the "cover of legitimacy" that some have requested, he said.  More importantly, Janabi said, the committee will operate on the basis of consensus rather than majority rule.  -- NUMBER OF ADDED MEMBERS: Janabi said that he supports adding 15 Sunni Arabs to the committee, which would bring the total number of Sunni Arabs to 17.  Janabi acknowledged that he is going to face obstacles from Sunni Arabs and Kurds in particular in pushing this number.  Some Sunni Arabs are pushing for 42 percent membership in the committee, a percentage matching that of the Iraqis who did not participate in the January elections.  Janabi said that some Sunni Arabs are using this specious methodology to calculate the number of Sunni Arabs in the country.  They will need to be convinced to back down, he said.   Kurds on the other hand will need to be convinced to raise the bar.  They are apparently pushing for adding only 12 Sunni Arabs to the committee, he said.  This would bring the total number of Sunni Arabs to 14, one less than the number of Kurdish representatives.  Janabi said that this number had already leaked, and he would not defend it.  Janabi said that he had met with President Talabani on June 6 and enlisted his support in convincing the Kurds to raise their threshold.  In any event, he said, the number of additions is really irrelevant as long as the committee agrees to operate by consensus.  -- THE PROS AND CONS OF OUTSIDE SUPPORT: Janabi said that the best help the USG can offer the constitution-drafting process is to remain distant enough from it that it is seen to be purely Iraqi.  He also said he thought international financial and technical support to the drafters would be best offered via the United Nations.  -- COMMITTEE'S PUBLICITY PLAN: Janabi said the committee will aim to publicize its work through supplements in newspapers and televised debates.  The effort will be to do such publicity in a way that it informs the public without dividing it, he said.  "It will be on our terms," he said. "We don't want to split the society.  It is very important that Iraqis see at as being inclusive and moving forward."  -- MEETING AUGUST 15 DEADLINES:  Janabi confirmed that the Constitution Committee has already agreed on a set of core principles and will be ready to get down to drafting immediately upon resolution of the Sunni Arab inclusion issue.  Janabi said he is confident that the committee can meet its August 15 deadline and predicted that contentious issues like Kirkuk will be kept out of the constitution process and pursued through the executive branch and the Article 58 committee.  -- OTHER THREATS TO SUNNI INCLUSION: Janabi used the occasion of the meeting to remind the Charge that Sunni Arab outreach is most threatened by a De-Ba'athification process that has been used to purge Sunnis rather than criminals from government jobs.  He also warned that triumphalist rhetoric from Shia Islamist groups about their victory in the January elections only inspires fear in the hearts of Sunni Arab citizens.  3. (C) COMMENT: Charge plans to meet PUK leader and Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Fu'ad Ma'asum to encourage him to be flexible on the number of Sunni Arabs allowed into the committee.  We will sit down with the Shia leadership after Janabi convenes his June 9 meeting to review the results and press for progress.  Janabi was optimistic, and he has grounds for hope after the strong turnout at his June 2 session, but he may be overly optimistic about the prospect for results on June 9.  The Sunni Arabs were never able to come together on an accepted list of ministers for Jafari's government, so it is unlikely that they will achieve such harmony on their nominees for this committee.  Furthermore, other Sunni contacts are already grumbling to us that Janabi is biased toward the National Dialogue Council at the expense of other important Sunni Arab voices.  Harmony may be elusive, but Janabi is to our eyes making an honest effort to look beyond the constitution and use this process to make a major step forward on Sunni Arab inclusion in the entire political process.  For the time being we are giving Janabi some political space, while continuing our engagement with ITG leaders and those of other political groupings to move the Sunni inclusion and constitution drafting process forward.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June 7 were the developments of the political and security situations. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Shall we have an Iraqi conference to stop violence?" (Al-Ittihad, June 7) B. "Credibility of the constitutional process" (As-Sabah, June 7)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Shall we have an Iraqi conference to stop violence?" (June 7)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a third-page editorial by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about violence in Iraq:  "It seems that the Iraqi people are becoming more concerned about the security situation because of the number of people that the terrorists are killing.  Iraqi blood is being shed daily and there seems to be no hope of this stopping in the near future.  Every Iraqi killed is a loss to this country.  We do not want to discuss who is behind these operations. We just want to put an end to them and stop the bloodshed. All Iraqi political parties must discard their disagreements and solve this security issue.  It paralyzes Iraqi society.  Those who accuse each other of being responsible for the violence in Iraq must unite in order to stop the daily Iraqi bloodshed.  We notice that all the patriotic groups announce condemnations after each terrorist operation that targets Iraqi citizens. However, we don't need more condemnations; we need a surgery to heal the Iraqi wound. But who will perform this surgery?  In fact, it is wrong to be waiting for a solution from abroad because only Iraqi people can heal these wounds.  Some neighboring countries announce that they will support Iraq. They don't want to stop the bloodshed in Iraq--they want the benefits. After the violence increased, we heard the neighboring countries and other countries announce that they will support the Iraqi government and help develop the Iraqi security forces. But we want tangible deeds and do not want statements and speeches.  Therefore, Iraqi people must be responsible for healing their own wounds. The Iraqi citizens want to know whether or not the Ministries of Interior and Defense are able to end this violence. We hear many calls for holding conferences under different names. But we did not hear any call to gather Iraqi political groups to discuss how to end violence."   B. "Credibility of the constitutional process" (6/7)  As-Sabah (independent) published a second-page editorial by Abdul Halim Al-Ghunaimi about the constitution:  "Some groups try to cast doubt upon the constitutional process by saying that the constitution is already drafted. They also call for postponing the whole project. These groups allege that the final draft of the constitution was imported from abroad.  They claim that the constitutional committee is only responsible for translating it from English to Arabic. On the other hand, the constitutional committee members confirm that they are studying how to expand the representation in the committee.  This shows that the government, the National Assembly and the constitutional committee understand that drafting the constitution is an important process that must be accomplished by a unanimous national decision. At the present time, we must fully understand the concepts of law, democracy and faith so that we can be sure that the Iraqi citizens are free from all restraints of dictatorship and political illiteracy."

Ensher for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) Summary.  Rival Sunni politicos made clear in June 7 conversations that there is continuing progress in enlarging the Constitutional Drafting Committee by adding Sunni representatives.  Some contacts suggested that one Sunni faction, the National Dialogue Council, enjoys the favor of the Sunni Deputy Chair of the Committee organizer of the effort, Adnan Janabi. Committee Chair Hammudi warned us about a Dialogue- dominated Sunni faction, reflecting possible worry for the legitimacy of the process and the potential strengthening of a rival to his own Shia group. End Summary.  2.  (C) Dr. Ayad Samarra'i of the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) described to Poloff June 7 current efforts to enlarge the Constitutional Drafting Committee.  He identified three main issues that require clarification.  Aside from the number of Sunnis to be added to the Committee, Samarra'i said his greatest concern was the method of choosing the Sunni delegates.  He complained the mechanism for selection was not transparent and suggested that Committee Deputy Chair Adnan Janabi was too close to the National Dialogue Council.  He also claimed the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Hamam al Hammudi "did not want to see a lot of National Dialogue people on the committee.  3.  (C) Samarra'i reiterated that the IIP had attempted -- in good faith -- to bring in other Sunni groups.  (He cited as proof his party's ongoing discussions with other political figures beyond the usual triumvirate of IIP, Muslim Ulema Council (MUC) and Sunni Waqf (Endownment), mentioning Sunni secularist Nasir Chardarchi and Communist Party leader Hamid Majid Mussa.  While MUC leader, Harith al Dhari, does not want to join the process, Samarra'i claimed others in the organization are willing.  The best way forward, he proposed, is to gather all the various Sunni factions into one room (including those who were not present at the meeting convened by Janabi on June 2), to debate the professional merits of all candidates and choose.  4.  (C) Sunni secular political party leaders Hatem Mukhlis was also generally positive in his June 7 discussion with Poloff about the progress in achieving Sunni participation in the constitution drafting.  He said the ruling Shia coalition had become more flexible after the Secretary's visit.  Mukhlis has also submitted lists of potential committee members to Janabi, but he also said Janabi favors National Dialogue.  Mukhlis said specifically that 10 attendees, out of 56, at Janabi's June 2 meeting of Sunjni leaders had been from the National Dialogue Council.  Samarra'i had cited the same numbers and noted that the IIP, MUC and the Waqif had only one representative each.  5.  (C) Dr. Saleh Mutlak, Spokesman for the National Dialogue generated the most enthusiasm and confidence to PolOff on June 7.  He referred to various conferences in the Sunni triangle that would help select nominees, including a June 11 effort in Diyala, an event in Anbar the week of June 12 and perhaps a conference in Mosul.  Mutlak, signaling the National Dialogue's position in the catbird seat, suggested the groups own candidates need not even serve on the committee.  He boasted the Dialogue is so flexible and open they would support the nominees of other factions, if they were professionally qualified.  6.  (C) Comment.  That Mutlak expresses such generosity about the possibility of non-National Dialogue on the Committee lends credence to his rivals' suspicions that the National Dialogue has a deal with Janabi.  Committee Chair Hammudi also expressed worry to Poloff in a separate June 7 discussion about members of that group dominating Sunni representation on the Committee.  His stated concern was that the Dialogue was planning to stage a dramatic withdrawal from the process at its end to strengthen itself in Sunni politics, while casting doubt on the legitimacy of the whole process.  Hammudi did not say he would interfere in Janabi's inclusion efforts, but wanted to signal us that the process would not be served by the domination of a particular Sunni faction.  A more united Sunni group would also be a stronger voice against specifically Shia interests, something that may be in Hammudi's mind as well.  7.

ENSHER.  REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Anbar Provincial Reconstruction Development Committee (PRDC) held its first official meeting May 29 in Ramadi.  Local officials from across the province and directors-general from various ministries attended the session, reflecting genuine and broad interest in the PRDC initiative.  Several participants primarily used the forum to complain about the lack of reconstruction progress -- a longstanding theme; others came prepared with detailed project proposals in hand.  Some flagged their concerns about the disproportionate attention, and resources, directed toward Fallujah in comparison to other cities.  Anbar Provincial Council Chairman Ma'moun urged the attendees to focus on projects, not offer complaints.  He said the body would meet weekly and work to prioritize proposals for funding in line with the troubled province's most urgent needs.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------------- ANBAR PRDC:  HIGH TURNOUT -------------------------  2.  (C) City and ministry representatives from across Anbar attended the province's opening PRDC meeting May 29, in Ramadi.  Iraqi participants included:  the mayors of Rutbah and Al-Waleed; Directors-General from Habbaniyah, Kubaysah and Al-Wafa; Deputy Mayor of Ramadi and city council chairmen from Habbaniyah, Hit, and Phurat.  U.S. participants included SET Fallujah and Baghdad PoloffS, Baghdad IRMO representative, MNF- I Political Military Economic Effects officers, 2nd Marine Division Chief of Staff, Marine Government Support Team (GST) Commander and S-2/Foreign Area Officer.  3.  (C) The provincial council chairman, Engineer Ma'moun, urged participants to take advantage of the initiative to direct resources to areas vital to the provincial leadership.  Acting Governor Taleb underscored the importance of new cooperation between local provincial officials and the coalition; mistakes had been made in the past but should not be repeated.  PRIORITIES MIXED WITH COMPLAINTS  4.  (C) PRDC participants underscored key priorities by sector (Directors-General) and location (city mayors and/or chairmen) to include:  --HEALTH:  The Director General of the Ministry of Health Rafe Hyad Chiad observed that committee was not needed to underscore that health conditions throughout the province were "very bad."  In Fallujah, several health problems had been resolved; he opined this might serve as a model.  More medical staff and ambulances were needed.  Of the eleven hospitals in the region, most were in poor condition; the needs of the 140 clinics were also great.  --EDUCATION:  The Education Ministry's DG, Engineer Fadhl al Saleh claimed that Ramadi suffered especially due to repeated, "coalition attacks on schools. Of the 1,150 schools in the area, all needed some repairs; he noted there was no budget for new school construction.  (Comment:  Schools in Ramadi have been used by insurgents to coordinate attacks.  End Comment.)  --ELECTRICITY:  Engineer Ziad Hamman representing the Ministry of Electricity outlined two necessary steps: reestablishing distribution grids, including new material (wires and generators) and building a new station in Ramadi as priorities.  --SEWAGE:  DG Engineer Ahmed Hattam Hamad, responsible for sewers, citied his priority as rebuilding lines and installing new pumps, referring to a written list of priorities for the Ministry of Water.  --RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS:  Ramadi Sunni Endownment Director, Ali K. al Zand said religious centers in Fallujah and Ramadi require rebuilding.  --RUTBAH:  The Mayor of Rutbah, Lawyer Raheem Sabah Barwani, commented security in the area for the last year had been stable and coordination with the coalition effective.  He emphasized that during the last two months, the security situation had begun to deteriorate.  Without improved security, all progress would be lost.  Health and electrical priorities had been identified; the most urgent issue remained a lack of water.  --AL-WALEED:  Waleed City Council member Sa'ad revealed that the small city lacked an electrical grid; power came from generators only.  Like other low population centers, it had lacked resources for a long time.  He urged the situation be rectified.  --HABBANIYAH:  The Mayor claimed there had been "no results" between coalition forces for some time. Water, roads and other services were "very weak"; schools were "a disaster" - many had their roofs falling in.  The area had recently suffered from over 1,000 cases of severe diarrhea; asbestos leakage into water continued to be a primary health concern.  --RAMADI: Deputy Mayor of Ramadi, Sa'ad argued coalition roadblocks were causing problems. According to the acting mayor, all who enter Ramadi considered it to be "an abandoned city"; it had become "a dump" due to absent garbage collection.  Sa'ad claimed most sewage ran into the river, creating widespread health problems.  He decried the fact that the city's glass factory, which had just recently reopened, was temporarily shut down again. (Note.  The temporary closure is due to the fact insurgents had used the site for direct and indirect fire on Coalition Forces.  End Note.)  --HIT:  City Council Chairman Kamel Dahih Mohammed emphasized that, as a city far from the provincial center (Ramadi), Hit had been ignored and given a low priority.  He further opined, "for the last ten months, problems have been discussed without solutions."  Health supplies would last only three days; conditions in hospitals were "miserable", the representative added.  -KUBAYSAH:  City Council Chairman recounted that Kubaysah had "endless problems - he could not list them all."  He began with "no pure water, no electricity, failing sewage network, not even 100 meters of paved roads, and destroyed schools". (COMMENT:  the Kubaysah rep then quoted 4th century and 17th century references to the city as a model community - far from its present day condition.)  -FURAT:  City Council Chairman Sheikh Jubaer al Nimrawi pointed out three outstanding problems: police salaries, 2,180 officers had not been paid in five months; water, approximately 500 houses lacked potable water; and severe shortages of equipment in clinics.  ------------------------ FALLUJAH-CENTRIC FUNDING ------------------------  5.  (C) Several representatives, notably the Habbiniyah official, complained that Fallujah had received a disproportionate share of government funds and attention.  (Note.  Two of the PC reps are from Fallujah, and several Fallujah leaders attended the PRDC session.  End Note.)  The IRMO representative noted that the ITG had decided that Fallujah reconstruction projects would remain a separate category, with its own funding stream, given the unique nature of the rebuilding task in the city following Operation Al-Fajr.  SET Poloff also underscored that he had stressed in numerous meetings with Fallujah leaders that reconstruction successes were also necessary in the rest of the province, not only in Fallujah.  A one-city strategy would not work.  6.  (C) Comment.  The attention paid to Fallujah represents a growing point of friction in the province.  Many Anbar residents question why the notorious city should be rewarded with new investment and ITG resources, particularly after Fallujans had allowed insurgents to overrun it.  The PRDC, in this way, could serve as a timely platform for other Anbar communities to leverage resources more widely.  7.  (C) While much of the first PRDC session elicited extensive complaints about the lack of reconstruction progress throughout Anbar, Ma'moun effectively blunted the criticisms.  He stressed that PRDC priorities, determined by local officials, represented an opportunity that should be seized.  8.  (C) Representatives from smaller Anbar communities predictably urged fairer distribution of resources, in line with the center-periphery splits apparent in most parts of the world.  The most effective presenters (a minority) came to the meeting prepared, with completed project files in hand.  Several traveled extensive distances to attend the session, which is noteworthy. ITG officials have made clear that they expect local officials to take advantage of the PRDC structure and send appropriate representation in all future meetings.  End Comment.  9.

Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Charge was called to a meeting with Deputy PM Rowsch Shaways (KDP) on June 7 to discuss the latest developments on the political front, with emphasis on Kurdish views.  Shaways began by reviewing the state of play with the Kurds:  Barzani should be sworn in as President in Irbil on Monday, with further steps to stand up the Kurdish Regional Government programmed in the next days to complete that process, which Shaways termed a major success for both Kurdish parties. Following the swearing-in, Barzani plans to come to Baghdad probably on June 16.  His primary focus will be on adding impetus to the constitutional process.  Following this introduction, Shaways brought up his main theme, the need to rein in PM Jafari's non-inclusive tendencies.  2. (C) After reviewing various faults in governance shown by Jafari (many of which, frankly, we share), Shaways said that the Presidency in particular was unhappy with the lack of consultation.  The deputy prime ministers (including Shaways, who perhaps is the most left out) were miffed at not being given specific portfolios, and the parliament was unhappy about not being consulted in advance on the PM's Turkey trip and the UNSCR 1546 review.  3. (C) Consequently, President Talabani will meet with Jafari on June 8 to raise these concerns and urge a change in Jafari's style.  Shaways handed over a five page Arabic text, basically a non-paper, that Talabani would either use or hand over, that spelled out all the above concerns in detail.  The scathing treatise directly confronts Jafari for acting "unilaterally and deviating from the (UIA/Kurdish Alliance) political agreement and the TAL," scolding the PM for altering the oath of office and marginalizing Article 58. The document chides Jafari for the appointment of Leith Kubba as ITG spokesman, characterizing him as "chauvinistic and anti-Kurdish."  Lamenting the PM's formation of nine committees which he directly controls, the document alleges that the DPMs have been "transformed into ministers of state without work or function."  The Prime Minister is accused of "flagrant legal violations" of articles 1, 24 and 25 of the TAL, namely by disregarding the separation of powers through the appointment of senior ITG officials without the consultation of the TNA or the Presidency Council.  Finally, PM Jafari is repeatedly charged with discounting the spirit of Article 58 of the TAL by "unilaterally and haphazardly" ignoring the issue, resulting in a "flagrant violation of the TAL."  Talabani warns in closing that this is a matter which he "cannot be silent about."  (NOTE: Exact text of Talabani's letter to follow in SEPTEL.  END NOTE)  4. (C) Talabani also plans to call for a steering group of a handful of Iraqis--balanced between Sunni Arabs, Shi'a Arabs, and Kurds--to do the key work on the constitution ("just like we did with the TAL"), and for it then to be approved by the parliament.  This initiative and the non-paper text have been, according to Shaways, "approved" by Barzani.  Talabani has also reviewed the initiative with SCIRI Chief Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who will accompany Talabani to the Jafari meeting. When pressed, however, Shaways would not claim explicitly that al-Hakim had endorsed the non-paper text.  5. (C) Shaways clearly wanted at a minimum a green light from us on this initiative.  Charge limited himself to saying that any effort to streamline government procedures and improve coordination and cooperation among government elements was to be applauded.  Charge then asked how Shaways thought the meeting, which amounted to a confrontation with Jafari, would come out.  Here Shaways was optimistic, saying that he believed that the President, Hakim, and Jafari would come to an agreement on these issues.  6. (C) COMMENT: There is a lot going on here.  The non-paper is written by Talabani, judging from the style.  It is very tough and accusatory.  Our own take of Jafari is that if confronted so openly, he could well react stubbornly.  We are not sure also to what degree al-Hakim is on board on the specific charges Talabani makes.  If he has signed up to all of this and supports Talabani, Jafari could have a very rough meeting.  Nevertheless, there is no one more anti-Jafari than Shaways, and he clearly wants to paint the situation with Jafari as negatively as possible, and attain maximum U.S. support for the "Kurdish" point of view.  END COMMENT.  7. (C) Charge and DCM will leverage their previously scheduled appointment on June 8 with President Talabani to follow-up on this issue.  8. (U) Minimize considered for Iraq REOs.

BAGHDAD 317      B. BAGHDAD 435  Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (S) SUMMARY: Sadrist advisors Hamid al-Sharifi and Saayid Imad Kelanter told PolOff June 7 that there is an ideological struggle between two distinctly different Sadrist camps over the conduct of relations with the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) and the Coalition. Both men asserted that Political Advisor Shaykh Ali Semaysim is looking to regain his prominence over the political strategy for the Sadrist movement and may be willing to reengage with the ITG and the U.S.  They key issue remains Sadr militia detainees held by the Coalition.  They urged the U.S. to put their trust in Shaykh Ali Semaysim and that the relatively low level intermediaries that the ITG and Coalition are now dealing with on this issue are followers of Sadrist rival Qais Khazali, an outspoken anti-Coalition advisor to al-Sadr.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------------------- A TALE OF BETRAYAL AND MISTRUST -------------------------------  2. (S) In a June 7 meeting at independent politico Saad Jabor's residence, Sadrist advisors Hamid al-Sharifi and Saayid Imad Kelanter told PolOff that Shaykh Ali Semyasim felt betrayed by broken promises made by Qassim Daoud and the Allawi government over the issue of detainees.  Kelanter emphasized that Shaykh Semaysim took many risks in meeting Daoud as well as the Charge in January as reported in the reftels.  The lack of any progress on the detainee issue, according to Kelanter, greatly undermined Semaysim's influence over Muqtada al-Sadr's camp and made future meetings with the Coalition and the ITG impossible.  He claimed that their experience with allegedly corrupt and ineffective IIG officials had deepened al-Sadr's suspicions.  3. (S) Kelanter alleged that Qais Khazali now has a huge influence over al-Sadr.  He said that money, weapons and trained men from Iran provide Khazali with influence over al-Sadr.  Kelanter said he is aware of the ongoing discussions by U.S. and ITG representatives with lower level Sadrists over the detainee issue and argued that these individuals (without naming anyone in particular) answer to Khazali.  PolOff said political discussions should be led by the ITG with the Coalition providing information as needed. Both men claimed that Semaysim is willing to reengage and they hope to arrange a meeting in the near future.  4. (S) Kelanter said that progress on the detainee issue with "tangible" benefits facilitated by Semaysim would improve his standing with al-Sadr and allow him to move his more moderate political agenda.  (NOTE: Sadrist Shaykh Moussa al-Saadi told PolOff on the same day that they have tentatively agreed to meet representatives from the Prime Minister's office to further discuss the issue of detainees on June 12. END NOTE).  He said that Semaysim hopes to complete the process of pulling the Sadrist movement into the political process by forming a separate, official political movement with its own separate list of candidates for the next elections.  Kelanter asserted that they already have a list of potential names that they hope to present to Prime Minister Jafari in the hopes of gaining "legitimacy" in the eyes of the political establishment.  He asked for a U.S. opinion of a Sadrist political party.  PolOff responded by saying that the U.S. always encourages wider political engagement by those who have foresworn violence and reiterated that we do not choose sides among competing political forces.  5. (S) Al-Sharifi asked PolOff for material support to help improve Semaysim's position.  He said that cell phones, an armored vehicle and travel outside of Iraq would greatly improve Semaysim's stature and expand his outlook by seeing the outside world.  PolOff said neither Semaysim, nor any other Iraqi politician should make his way by depending on such support, but noted our willingness to engage.  --------------------------- MUC-BADR CORPS NEGOTIATIONS ---------------------------  6. (S) On the issue of ongoing Sadrist-facilitated negotiations between the Muslim Ulema Council (MUC) and the Badr Corps over accusations of Badr collusion in the deaths of Sunni clerics, al-Sharifi predicted the Badr Corps would never accommodate the MUC.  Al-Sharifi said that any negotiated agreement between both sides would look like a victory for al-Sadr, which is precisely what the Badr Corps and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) do not want.  He said Badr and SCIRI see the Sadrist camp as their main challenger for influence.  7. (S) COMMENT: Al-Sharifi and Kelanter's assertions had the feel of desperation and tend to substantiate rumors of Semaysim's reduced influence within the Sadr movement.  The detainee issue, while materially important to the rank and file Sadrists and the militia, is evidently being played as an internal issue within the Sadrist camp to demonstrate authority and influence.

Jeffrey for reason 1.4 (b)  1. (C)  Below is the full text of President Talabani's non-paper to Prime Minister Jafari; referred to in REFTEL.  2. (C) BEGIN TEXT:  His Excellency the Prime Minister Dr. Ibrahim al-Jafari  With Greetings and Respect,  The Kurdish Alliance  - an equal partner in the Unified Coalition of Iraq - has noticed with much regret that in forming the Government in accordance with the Protocol of Agreement between the two sides, you have departed from some of the most important provisions of the agreement and violated some of the most important articles of the TAL. Your Excellency, it has been noticed that you are clearly acting unilaterally and avoiding the content and spirit of the agreement concluded between the Alliance and the Coalition as well as the TAL which should prevail until the completion of the permanent constitution.  While we are summarizing to your Excellency our remarks, we look forward from now on to conformity with the facts in accordance with the Law and the provisions of the Agreement for the sake of continued brotherhood and cooperation between us in order not to be forced to use our rights in accordance with Article (2) of the Protocol of Agreement because we can not keep silent and accept the imposed status quo which is contrary to the Law and the Agreement.  First: You have omitted from the oath performed by the Ministers a very important and a principal provision, which is "its Democratic and Unionist system."  Second: Your speech did not mention Federalism and Kurdistan, the great martyrs, and the crimes of Anfal committed against the people of Iraqi Kurdistan while it included language and detailed phrases about simple matters.  Third: Your long speech did not mention and condemn the policies of ethnic cleansing and the necessity of removing its impact as well as the implementation of Article 58 of the TAL.  Fourth: You have announced important appointments without referring in advance to the Cabinet and the Presidency of the Republic and even without consulting with them.  You have appointed Mr. Laith Kubba as a Spokesman for the Transitional Government without the agreement of the more important party in the Coalitionan despite the fact that he (Mr. Kubba) is known for his chauvinistic and antagonistic position towards Federalism as well as his provocative statements in America against the rights of the Kurdish people which were confirmed by the TAL, despite Mr. Kubba's antagonistic position towards the political parties of the Iraqi opposition and his promotion of deceiving concepts with the Americans, which caused them to commit the mistakes we are still suffering from.  Also, the appointment of a member of the Da'wa party at the rank of a minister without the advance approval of the cabinet and the Presidency of the Republic.  Fifth: You have created nine ministerial committees totally connected to your Excellency thus transforming the deputy prime ministers to ministers of state without work or functions despite your knowledge that Dr. Rowsch Nouri Shaways represents the second list in the National Assembly and the second nationality of the Iraqi people.  This is considered an aggression on the rights of the representatives of the Kurdish people and national consensus.  Sixth: You have limited, without legal justification and any rights, the authorities of Dr. Barham Ahmed Salih who is the Minister of Planning and International Development and confiscated half of his rights instead of adding other rights as agreed with the Coalition on the day of the formation of the Government.  Dear Respected Brother,  We come now to your legal violations:  First: You are ignoring the fact that the Prime Ministry is part of the Government.  Instead, you are acting as if you are the Government and you are limiting its authority to yourself alone, which is a clear violation of the provisions of Article 24 stipulating the following:  Article 24:  (A)   The Iraqi Transitional Government, which is also referred to in this Law as the federal government, shall consist of the National Assembly; the Presidency Council; the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister; and the judicial authority. (B)   The three authorities, legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be separate and independent of one another.  (C)   No official or employee of the Iraqi Transitional Government shall enjoy immunity for criminal acts committed while in office.  Article 25 stipulates the following:  The Iraqi Transitional Government shall have exclusive competence in the following matters:  (A)   Formulating foreign policy and diplomatic representation; negotiating, signing, and ratifying international treaties and agreements; formulating foreign economic and trade policy and sovereign debt policies;  (B)   Formulating and executing national security policy, including creating and maintaining armed forces to secure, protect, and guarantee the security of the country's borders and to defend Iraq;  (C)   Formulating fiscal policy, issuing currency, regulating customs, regulating commercial policy across regional and governorate boundaries in Iraq, drawing up the national budget of the State, formulating monetary policy, and establishing and administering a central bank;  (D)   Regulating weights and measures and formulating a general policy on wages;  (E)   Managing the natural resources of Iraq, which belongs to all the people of all the regions and governorates of Iraq, in consultation with the governments of the regions and the administrations of the governorates, and distributing the revenues resulting from their sale through the national budget in an equitable manner proportional to the distribution of population throughout the country, and with due regard for areas that were unjustly deprived of these revenues by the previous regime, for dealing with their situations in a positive way, for their needs, and for the degree of development of the different areas of the country;  (F)   Regulating Iraqi citizenship, immigration, and asylum; and  (G)   Regulating telecommunications policy.  Is this the way you advise everybody that the Government is composed of the Presidency of the State, the Presidency of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, and that settling and prescribing the policies of the Government are among the duties and authorities of the three branches and not the Prime Minister alone.  The Government Statement  1- The Government statement prescribes the public policy of the Government. The three branches of the Government have the right to see, discuss and approve public policy before it is presented to the National Assembly. However you ignored all of this and did it alone.  2- The Government statement did not mention Article 58 of the TAL as well as the suffering of the Kurdish people as a result of the ethnic cleansing policy.  3- In preparing the Statement you violated the principle of agreement in accordance with paragraph (2) of Article (1) and paragraph (5), which necessitates political agreement before taking principal political, security, economic and administrative decisions. 4- The Government Statement did not mention: the full implementation of Article 58 of the TAL leading to the determination of administrative affiliations of disputed areas including the Governorate of Kirkuk, as stipulated in paragraph (1) of (Fourth). 5- The Government Statement ignored Article (3) of the Agreement between the Unified Coalition and the Kurdish Alliance.  Regarding Kirkuk  It appears from the Government Statement and your clear practical approval in your decisions regarding stopping payment of the amount approved by the former Government of Kirkuk that your Excellency is practically taking an opposing view contrary, if not antagonistic, to the rights of the Kurdish people regarding Kirkuk.  1- Your Government Statement did not mention the necessity of the full implementation of Article 58 as stipulated in paragraph (1) of (Fourth).  2- Your Excellency's violation of the following text stated in paragraph (2) of the (Fourth): "The Transitional Government, within a period not exceeding one month, shall activate the normalization procedures including providing funds to finance the Commission for the Normalization of the situation in Kirkuk and the Commission for Property Disputes."  3- Instead of implementing the above-mentioned text, you have decided haphazardly and unilaterally to stop payment of the amount approved for Kirkuk by the former Governorate of Kirkuk without consulting the Council of Ministers or the Presidency of the State.  Ignoring the issue of Kirkuk is in our view a very serious matter, and a clear violation of the agreement concluded between the Coalition and the Alliance and a clear violation of the TAL and the Alliance could not keep silent concerning this imposed status quo, let alone accepting it.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Charge Satterfield joined the Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Interior in a May 30 dinner with the Minister of Interior Baqr Jabr where they discussed: Middle East and Iraqi political developments, the current security operations in Baghdad, as well as police training programs and human rights reform.  The meeting proved a useful interface to broadly review current Ministry of Interior initiatives and learn how the Minister intends to advance security in Baghdad and throughout country.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Charge joined Mr. Casteel and the Minister of Interior Baqr Jaber for a May 30 dinner at the Adnon Palace. The Charge and Minister discussed the political reforms throughout the Middle East, agreed the January Iraqi election was the spark of change, and expressed the importance of ensuring the next round of Iraqi elections are supported and carried out in December 2005.  The Charge and Minister also agreed the  Syrian government is a major obstacle to the advancement of democracy in the region.  At present, the Syrians are only changing their words, but not their actions. The Charge emphasized that while the highest officials of the Syrian Government sorely crave international attention, the international community must focus its attention at the lower levels and only shift that attention once we begin to see positive action.  3. (C) Jabr described his recent meeting with Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in Irbil on May 20 as productive. Jabr conveyed he will continue to assist the Kurdish forces where he can with equipment and political support and stressed the central government must show its support to the Kurdish region.  He then added he is a strong supporter of the Iraqi Transitional Government's (ITG) President Jalal Talibani from the Patriotic Union of Kurds (PUK) as they have worked together for the past twenty years.   However, he is not such an advocate of Mr. Barzani who disappointed him in 1996 when he allied with Saddam Hussien.  This disappointment led Jabr to speak out publicly against Barzani to the displeasure of SCIRI officials.  4. (C) Both Charge and Jabr agreed the operations currently underway in Baghdad are proving successful. The results are a product of better than expected coordination between MoI, Ministry of Defense and Coalition forces. While admitting there still remains a lot of work ahead, Jabr is pleased with the progress and the ground swell of support from the Baghdad citizenry. Jabr ended by mentioning that the number of IEDs and VBIEDs are down over the past week and there have been zero VBIED's over the past two days.  5. (C) Charge expressed the importance of building on this coordination with the MoD at the upcoming European Union conference in Brussels.  It will be an ideal opportunity to voice a unified Ministry of Interior MoI and MoD vision for Iraq. Jabr agreed and stated he is attending the conference because of its importance to the future Iraq both from a security and diplomatic perspective.  6. (C) Jabr stated his priorities for the MoI are building the intelligence structure, improving police training, increasing the efficiency of the Ministry as an institution, and bringing about fundamental human rights reform. (NOTE: The Minister's passion for human rights reform is more pronounced than any other of the four Minister's IRMO-MOI advisers have worked with. This may rest with the fact that Jabr and his immediate family emigrated from Iraq in 1982 after the regime of Saddam Hussein executed 12 family members.  The regime then executed his brother in 1996 to further pressure Jabr to stop his political and media activities. END NOTE)  7. (U) Minimize considered for REOs Basrah, Hillah, Kirkuk, and Mosul.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June 8 were the security and political situations. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Al-Jafari needs a rest" (Al-Ittihad, June 8) B. "The language of the constitution " (Al-Mashriq, June 8)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Al-Jafari needs a rest" (June 8)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK) published a fifth-page editorial by Faryad Rawanduzi about the Al-Jafari government's political program:  "What will happen to the Iraqi transitional government if Al-Jafari continues administering his government this way? I think Al-Jafari should reread Articles 24 and 25 of the TAL. He must ask for legal advice to help explain to him the role of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister is a member of the government.  Al-Jafari is acting like he is the government.  He should remember that he does not govern the entire country.  Al-Jafari must understand that he cannot make decisions by himself.  He has to discuss any decision with the Kurdish Alliance, which is an ally of the UIA. Paragraph A of Article 24 applies to the current government.  Everyone knows that Al-Akhdar Al-Ibrahemi formed the former Iraqi government. Hence, that government lacked harmony. The current government was democratically elected.  And if this government wants to continue functioning properly, Al- Jafari must reread the sixth paragraph of the agreement between the Kurdish Alliance and UIA.  Al-Jafari's political program showed shortsightedness in its handling of sensitive portfolios. The government's political program must be prioritized according to what is best for the people. It must not be established according to personal visions. I think Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jafari needs time to rest in order to review his visions and ideas because he is not a leader of a specific political party but the Prime Minister of Iraq."  B. "The language of the constitution" (June 8)  Al-Mashriq (independent) published a last-page editorial by Dr. Hadi Nu'man Al-Hiti about the constitution:  "Although the constitution is not subject to any one particular authority, the drafting of the constitution is subject to many different authorities.  The drafting committee has a chairman and a deputy and members.  The draft that they were assigned to work on remains only a draft until the people approve it.  There are those that say that in many situations the people are just like children.  Children always give their acceptance or refusal of a situation before they understand the context of the situation. Therefore, if there is a disagreement on forming the drafting committee, it is a family conflict.  There is no need for ethnic power sharing in this committee formation. It is best to form this committee by using legal specialists, political specialists, and open-minded elites. This constitution is to be in the language of the law and not in the language of militias and separate political parties.  The print and television media is the field for the language of the militias and the political parties; the language of the constitution should be a scientific language, because it is very important."

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002444  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/2025 TAGS: KDEM, PGOV, KISL, IZ, KINR SUBJECT: BADR ORGANIZATION CONFERENCE SHOWCASES STRENGTH  Classified By: A/Polcouns Henry S. Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C) Summary.  The Badr Organization Conference kicked off a two-day conference for its leadership with a June 8 opening ceremony that had the feel of a political party rally.  The ceremony celebrated the anniversary of the Badr Organization's transformation from militia to an ostensibly separate political party.  The Organization's success in getting high- level attendance, including both the president and Prime Minister was evidence of its continuing clout in Iraq.   End Summary.  2.  (C) At the opening ceremony, Badr political adviser Abdul Kareem al-Naqib told A/Polcouns that the event had been a success, noting with pride the attendance of senior Iraqi politicians and other members of the diplomatic corps.  He said that the Badr Organization was fully a political party with its own agenda separate from that of SCIRI.  Naqib made this remark while standing under a three times life- size photo of SCIRI leader Hakim which faced across the podium a slightly smaller photo of Ayatollah Sistani.  He said Badr was focused on achieving its goals through political means and encouraging others to do so as well.  He referred to Badr's outreach efforts with Sunni groups.  Al-Naqib noted that none of the well-known Sunni groups could claim to represent a majority of the Sunni population - the Iraqi Islamic Party and the National Dialogue Council for example, represented 10-20 percent of the range of views among Sunnis. For that reason, Badr was dealing directly with key Sunni tribes in Ramadi, Mosul and Mahmudiyah, an insurgent center south of Baghdad.  Al- Naqib said current security operations in Baghdad had improved the situation in the capital, but said these efforts were undercut by too lenient sentences for criminals and terrorists meted out by judges.  3.  (C) The conference itself appeared to be well organized and enjoyed coverage from the major media outlets, including hours of live coverage on Al Iraqiyah.  The opening ceremony kicked off two days of closed, internal meetings among the leadership of the Badr Organization and SCIRI.  It was held in an air- conditioned tent inside the SCIRI-Badr compound with security provided by a motley crew of Badr militia, IPS and the Iraqi Army.  The Conference format was a simple series of speeches from a range of politicians, including representatives of Sunni parties and arguably the most prominent Christian leader in Iraq, Yonadam Kanna.  4.  (C) Kanna told PolOff after the ceremony that the event was just a way for SCIRI to showcase the new political strength of the Badr Organization.  He said the organizers were very clever in inviting a wide range of guests and notable speakers to include President Talabani, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari, Vice President Ghazi al-Yawr, Dr. Nadeem Jabouri (Al Fadhilla), and Husayn al-Shahristani.  He said that he was obliged to come as the token Christian and that he understood his role was to show that SCIRI and the Badr Organization believes in diversity.  Kanna said that most of the speakers were generally positive, if not mundane with some notable exceptions.  Ex-Governor Fassal Gaood of Anbar urged the Badr Corps to join the fight against the terrorists and to look for Islamic solutions to the problems of the country.  5.  (C) Kanna said that it was good that the U.S. was represented at the opening ceremony, since the U.S. relationship with Badr helped dampen extremist tendencies in the Badr Organization.   He said that U.S. officials photographed with Al-Hakim and Hadi al- Amiri will "ensure that there will be newspapers burning in Tehran."  6.  (C) With regard to the Muslim Ulema Council-Badr Organization reconciliation effort, Kanna said that he was confident that no agreement or understanding will be reached.  He believes that MUC leader Hareth al- Dhari cannot be reasoned with and he must be taken to court when he makes unfounded accusations.  Badr leader Hadi al-Amiri has repeatedly made this assertion and has filed a lawsuit against Al-Dhari. End Comment).  7.  (C) Comment:  The event appeared to have achieved its most important objectives by portraying the Badr Organization as a credible political entity.  However, the leading role of Abd Aziz al-Hakim, on the one hand and the presence of well-armed militia members on the other, make clear that Badr is still just as much Corps as Organization.  8.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation Barham Saleh on June 7 told the Charge that the initial steps taken by the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) and Prime Minister Jaafari were weak and lackluster. On the constitution, Shi'a political groups are pushing to complete a first draft by July 15, subject to further revision before the August 15 deadline for approval by the Transitional National Assembly (TNA): religion, federalism, and regime type are the most important constitutional issues.  The Minister advised the USG to remain consistently engaged in Iraq and to avoid ceding influence to Iran.  Saleh remains unhappy with Jaafari's decision to make Finance Minister Allawi the focal point for coordinating donor aid, telling us there has been no formal reassignment of the portfolio in writing.  The Minister has completed a draft of the National Development Strategy that will highlight economic reform, the need for private sector development, and other pro-market initiatives.  Saleh has received a letter from the Jordanian Minister of Planning saying that Amman would prefer to postpone the IRFFI donors' conference until August or September.  END SUMMARY.  2. (SBU) Charge Satterfield and emboffs met on June 7 with Barham Saleh, Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation.  -------------------------------------- ITG MUST AVOID WEAKNESS, OVER-REACHING --------------------------------------  3. (C) Assessing the general situation in Iraq, Saleh said the country's problems can be solved, but only if the ITG adopts a line of march based on a realistic understanding of the country's history and complexity.  In particular, the new majority comprising the victims of Saddam's regime--Shi'a and Kurds--must avoid the temptation to over-reach. The ITG's initial steps in this regard have been lackluster, and Prime Minister Jaafari's leadership has been weak, according to Saleh.  Jaafari has been acting as a factional rather than national leader and does not understand the complexity of Iraq, especially the need to mollify the Sunni minority. Moreover, Saleh added, Jaafari and his party have not honored their commitments, such as the scope of the Planning portfolio (see paragraph 8 below) and other promises to the Kurds.  (COMMENT: Saleh's comments track with the accounts of Rowsch Shaways and President Talabani regarding a July 8 "confrontation" with PM Jafari over his presumed failings (SEPTEL).  END COMMENT)  ----------------------------------------- CONSTITUTION APPARENTLY ON THE FAST TRACK -----------------------------------------  4. (C) Saleh told us that the Shi'a were pushing to complete a first draft of the constitution by July 15, subject to further revision before the August 15 deadline for approval by the TNA.  (NOTE: Constitution Committee Chairman Hammoudi said in a separate meeting with poloff that this was his goal as well.  END NOTE)  A "kitchen group" including Saleh, Deputy President Mahdi, and Deputy Prime Minister Shaways was working behind the scenes to expedite the process.  He highlighted three issues as most important:  -- The role of religion in the state.  -- Definition of federalism: Saleh said he would like to see political authority and revenues devolved as much as possible to the regions.  -- Type of regime: Saleh admitted that a presidential regime would be more "natural" for most Iraqis and appeared the preference of the Shi'a.  The Kurds, however, will press for a parliamentary regime.  -------------------------- NEED TO CONTROL INSURGENCY --------------------------  5. (C) Saleh said he sees dangerous signs that Sunni religious agitation is being politicized, raising the possibility that the insurgency will metastasize into a broader Sunni insurrection.  To forestall this, in his opinion, the new Shi'a majority must reach out to moderate Sunni leaders such as TNA Speaker al-Hashimi, who need to be made to appear strong and credible in their constituents' eyes.  The Minister concurred with the Charge's assessment of the importance for the ITG of harmonizing its message on the insurgency both internally and in communicating with the Iraqi public.  -------------------- ADVICE: STAY ENGAGED --------------------  6. (C) Turning to how the USG should proceed in Iraq, Saleh said we must first build on what has worked.  The strict timetable imposed on the lifespan of the Iraqi Interim Government and on the constitution-writing process shares much of the responsibility for the successful elements of recent political developments.  The U.S. also has done an effective job of Sunni outreach, which most Iraqis view as serious and credible.  Moreover, Saleh continued, we ought not ignore regions such as the Kurdish north that have remained relative secure and stable.  The Minister noted in this regard that he was traveling to Sulaimaniyah and Erbil on June 9 for meetings with Regional President Barzani and other regional figures.  7. (C) The U.S. can do a better job of staying consistently engaged in Iraq and maintaining a mid-point between intervention and indifference, Saleh told us.  We should not under-estimate the importance of our role and influence here.  In the Minister's assessment, the U.S. is one of three critical factors in the country; the other two--Ayatollah Sistani and Iran--are also foreign.  ------------------------------- COORDINATING DONOR COORDINATION -------------------------------  8. (C) Saleh told us he was surprised when he learned that the ITG's focal point for coordinating donor aid was to be Finance Minister Allawi.  The Planning Minister believes this was done largely for partisan reasons, so a member of Jaafari's party could be seen as responsible for large flows of donor aid.  (NOTE: Information from local Canadian aid representative Heather Cruden tends to substantiate Saleh's suspicions.  Jaafari's chief of staff Laith Koubba told her late last month that the donor aid focal point was the person of the Minister of Finance and not the institution of the Ministry of Finance.  END NOTE)  Saleh commented that, beyond the dent this put in his own standing, the move had been done in a way that created unnecessary confusion.  First, there is simply no time to establish a donor coordination unit in Finance in time for the Brussels and IRFFI conferences. Moreover, there has been no formal reassignment of the portfolio; Saleh has seen nothing in writing about this from the Prime Minister's office.  Saleh and Finance Minister Allawi had been convened by Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi to try to resolve the issue on June 6, but it appears little headway was made.  Summing up, the Minister said, "The way things are going is a bad omen."  9. (C) Charge noted that the Prime Minister's appointment of the Finance Minister as focal point for donor coordination might not be optimal, but it would be counter-productive to second-guess this decision now.  At this Saleh stepped down a bit, saying he recognized the need to stay engaged with all his ITG counterparts and put Iraq's best foot forward at Brussels and the other meetings.  --------------- ECONOMIC VISION ---------------  10. (C) Saleh told us he remained a "non-planner" despite his new portfolio and promised he would not "go native" during his tenure at the Planning Ministry.  He wants to highlight the Ministry's role in attracting and nurturing private sector investment, and for it to serve as a resource center for all types of investment.  11. (C) Saleh said a committee in the Ministry, led by Senior Deputy Minister Faik Abdol Rasool, has completed an economic strategy document for presentation at the Brussels and the IRFFI conferences.  This strategy focuses on economic reform and the need for private sector development.  (NOTE: We will obtain a copy from the Ministry and share with Washington. END NOTE)  ---------------------------------- POSSIBLE DELAY IN IRFFI CONFERENCE ----------------------------------  12. (C) Saleh mentioned in passing a letter he had just received from the Jordanian Planning Minister, stating that the Jordanian hosts would prefer that the IRFFI conference take place in August or September, and not in July.  Saleh appeared nonplussed by this news.  (NOTE: The Minister's chief of staff has promised to send us a copy of this letter, which we will share.  At a separate meeting of donor representatives on June 7, EC Iraq Mission chief Ana Gallo-Alvarez said her Amman office had heard that the Jordanians would prefer a September date for the IRFFI conference.  Representatives from Canada--chair of the donors committee--and the World Bank said they had not been informed.  END NOTE)  13. (U) REO Hillah, Basrah, Kirkuk, and Mosul Minimize considered. Jeffrey

Jeffrey, Charge d'Affaires, for r  easons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) Summary: President Talabani told Charge in a June 8 meeting that Prime Minister Jafari is carrying out his office unilaterally and marginalizing Kurdish officials.  Talabani said he planned to meet Jafari and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim that night to complain over issues ranging from slights over property and ethnocentric speeches to destabilizing moves that have blocked money allotted to Kirkuk and disempowered Kurdish cabinet officials.  Talabani said his relationship with Mas'ud Barzani is excellent and both men are working together in an outreach to Turkmen leaders in Kirkuk.  Talabani said he supported adding 25 Sunni Arabs to the constitution drafting committee.  He agreed with the Charge's call for serious Sunni Arab inclusion and promised to work with MNF-I in resolving security problems in the insurgency-plagued city of Hawija. End Summary.  ---------------------------------------- An Internal Iraqi Summit Set for Tonight ----------------------------------------  2. (C) President Talabani told Charge and DCM in a June 8 meeting that he was attending an internal Iraqi summit that night to discuss a host of accumulating disputes over government power sharing, Kirkuk, and Sunni Arab inclusion in the TNA Constitution Drafting Committee.  The meeting will bring together Talabani, Prime Minister Jafari, Vice President Adil abd al-Mehdi and SCIRI leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim is hosting.  Talabani said that he considered this group to be the key leadership committee in Iraq.  Hakim, he pointed out, only allowed Jafari to take the Prime Ministership in exchange for being considered the "political authority" (marja) of the Shia coalition.  ------------------------------------- Concern Over Jafari's Expanding Power -------------------------------------  3. (C) Talabani told the Charge that he is increasingly concerned that Prime Minister Jafari is acting beyond his legal authorities in running the state.  The key difference in their views, Talabani made clear, lies in their definition of Iraq's "government."  Jafari seems to think he possesses unilateral executive authority, Talabani said, but TAL Article 24 defines the "Iraqi Transitional Government" as consisting of the National Assembly, Presidency Council and Council of Ministers.  4. (C) Talabani said this article leads to the conclusion that "there must be agreement between the two lists (Kurdish and Shia) about everything."  Talabani proceeded to lay out Kurdish grievances in detail.  (Note: The points echoed those found in a blunt and angry letter Talabani recently wrote to Jafari, a copy of which was passed to Charge on June 7 by Deputy Prime Minister Rowsch Shaways (REFTEL B).  End Note)  5. (C) The following were the key grievances:  -- OBJECTING TO LAITH KUBBA'S APPOINTMENT: Talabani said that Jafari acted illegally in unilaterally selecting Laith Kubba as the government's spokesman.  Charge replied that he understood Kubba to be Jafari's personal spokesman.  Talabani shot back that Kubba is acting with the authority of a Deputy Minister, a position that must be approved by the cabinet and ratified by the Presidency Council.  (NOTE: Talabani's letter denounces Kubba for his allegedly "chauvinistic and antagonistic position towards federalism as well as his provocative statements in America against the rights of the Kurdish people..." END NOTE)  -- FREEZING DPM SHAWAYS OUT OF KEY COMMITTEES:  Talabani said Jafari has frozen his deputy prime ministers out of power, relegating them to little more than "ministers of state." Jafari's has created nine ministerial committees directly reportable to him, Talabani complained, subsuming portfolios the deputies should handle.  (NOTE:  The letter refers to this insult to Rowsch Shaways as "an aggression on the rights of the representatives of the Kurdish people and national consensus."  END NOTE)  -- UNACCOUNTABLE BUDGET EXPENDITURES: Talabani said that Jafari has spent some $38 million since coming to office without giving the Presidency Council any idea where the money has gone.  (NOTE: In previous meetings with Emboffs, Talabani has accused ex-President Ghazi al-Yawar of the same, threatening to order audits by the Public Integrity Commission.  END NOTE)  -- BARHAM SALIH DISEMPOWERED: Talabani complained that Jafari had robbed Planning Minister Barham Salih of real authority. (NOTE: His letter angrily describes Jafari of "usurping" Salih's "rights" in violation of a side agreement made on the day the government was formed.  END NOTE)  -- UNDOING KIRKUK AGREEMENT: Talabani said that Jafari has undone a major achievement of the Allawi government in blocking an agreement to provide $125 million in funding to the Iraqi Property Claims Commission and the so-called Article 58 Committee, whih would help resolve the Kirkuk situation.  $25 million had been disbursed by the time Jafari took office, Talabani said, and Jafari has blocked the disbursement of the remaining $100 million to the two entities.  -- BADGERING KURDS AND BILKING THE PRESIDENCY:  Talabani said the Jafari government has inappropriately badgered former National Council Speaker (and PUK leader) Fuad Ma'asum for the return of his armored car.  Ma'asum still needs the vehicle and is a key TNA official, Talabani pointed out. More seriously, Talabani said, the Jafari cabinet has confiscated significant holdings from the presidency office without accounting for them.  Talabani said that 19 cars have been taken from him and 140 are registered to his office with no record of where they are.  Furthermore, the presidency has control over 12 houses but Talabani does not know where they are and has no house of his own.  (COMMENT: These irregularities may be the responsibility of former President Ghazi al-Yawar, not Jafari. END COMMENT)  ------------------------------------- Progress on Sunni and Kirkuk Outreach -------------------------------------  6. (C) Once he moved off of Kurdish grievances with Jafari, Talabani's mood brightened and he laid out progress on several fronts:  -- STRONG SUNNI ARAB PRESENCE FOR CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE: Talabani said he had met with several Sunni Arab leaders and supported the addition of 25 Sunni Arab members to the Constitution Drafting Committee.  Talabani said he expected them to act as "equal members" while respecting that the ultimate product of the committee would pass through the National Assembly for approval.  He expected Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim to agree to this formulation, which brings the committee up to 80 members.  The issue would be finalized in 2-3 days, he said.  -- SOLID RELATIONS WITH BARZANI: Talabani said his relationship with Barzani is excellent. He encouraged the DCM to go forward with a planned trip to meet Barzani in the north in the coming days.  Talabani said that Barzani had attended on invitation the recent 13th PUK anniversary celebration in Dokan, a major statement of unity.  The KRG has officially begun its work with the successful election of a speaker for the assembly and a cabinet. "All problems have been solved," Talabani said.  -- IMPROVING RELATIONS IN KIRKUK: Talabani said he believed Iraq faced a "golden opportunity" to solve the problems of Kirkuk and was arguing this to Barzani as well.  Talabani said he had personally received Faruq Abdallah, head of the Iraqi Turkmen Front, and reached agreement that the Turkmen deserve a role in the administration of Kirkuk.  Talabani said he had convinced Barzani to join him in working with the Front.  Talabani added that he considered the Turkish government's attitude in the area improved.  -- TROUBLE IN HAWIJA: Talabani agreed with Charge that the city of Hawija south of Kirkuk is seeing problematic insurgent activity, particularly from the Ansar al-Sunna. Talabani said he believed the group was exploiting Arab concerns in the province over Kurdish influence.  The key will be improving the relationships in the area.  "We must convince the Arabs to live with us," he said.  "Hawija has always had strong cells of Syrian Ba'athists and Saddam's Ba'athists."  Talabani was concerned that Iraqi and U.S. forces better coordinate arrest and detention efforts in the area, he said. --------------------------------- Looking Forward to New Ambassador --------------------------------- 7. (C) Talabani was aware of Ambassador Khalilzad's SFRC hearing and said he looked forward to his arrival.  Talabani agreed when Charge urged him to continue his positive work on Sunni Arab inclusion in the Constitution Committee.  Talabani also agreed with Charge that a stronger dialogue with Jafari was needed to resolve the disputes he laid out.  ----------------------------------- COMMENT: Iraq's Embattled Executive -----------------------------------  8. (C) COMMENT: As with Shaways and in DCM's meetings with FM Zebari and Finance Minister Allawi, we urged Talabani to pursue constant, non-confrontational dialogue on this and to make haste in the process of adding Sunni Arabs to the constitution drafting committee.  Those are the paths to resolving these disputes and these leaders appear to be heading down them.  The internal summit Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim is hosting is the right forum for these men to hash out power sharing on the ground.  And the constitution committee, now poised to include a large delegation of Sunni Arabs, is the right forum for them to enshrine power sharing in the law. END COMMENT.  9.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June. 9 were the Badr Organization's conference, Arab Sunni participation in the constitutional committee, and the developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Familiarity" (Al-Sabah, 6/9) B. "The four portfolios" (Al-Bayyan, 6/9)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Familiarity" (Al-Sabah, 6/9)  Al-Sabah (independent) published a front-page editorial by Muhammad Abdul Jabbar about the National Assembly's meetings:  "Transparency of political life in democratic regimes means that the citizenry must be informed about the decisions of the parliament. It is simply improper to make political discussions behind closed doors. In Kuwait, for instance, journalists and citizens that wish to attend parliamentary sessions are given their own private seats to view the events. In Britain, parliamentary meetings are broadcast live on public television. This way, millions of people in these countries are aware of what is being discussed in their respective parliaments.  In Iraq, the National Assembly members are the elected representatives of the people. Iraqi citizens have a right to be informed about their representatives' discussions and decisions. As a result, the people will be able to monitor and analyze the performance of their representatives in order to ensure that they are living up to the people's expectations. There is no need for secret sessions of the parliament unless there is an urgent state of affairs that requires they be held secretly for the sake of protecting our national security. It is acceptable to make these particular sessions secret, but only if certain matters are discussed that cannot be disclosed outside government circles.  Nonetheless, the Iraqi National Assembly is not an ordinary commission. It is a foundational assembly that is responsible for preparing the draft of the permanent constitution. The Assembly was elected for this very purpose. However, until now, the National Assembly's sessions and discussions have been far from public knowledge. At times, assembly members have disclosed information to the media outlets that are hungry for knowledge. This scenario only sheds light on the fact that public opinion is ignorant about what is really going on inside the National Assembly. The constitutional committee must address this issue because it is tasked with a mission that is more important than that of the National Assembly. For the sake of the political process and the transparency of democracy, the assembly members must allow journalists to attend the assembly's meetings. The Assembly must allow citizens to attend these sessions and it must broadcast these sessions live on Al-Iraqiyya television. In addition, the National Assembly must publish the transcripts of its sessions."  B. "The four portfolios" (Al-Bayyan, 6/9)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with the Islamic Dawa Party led by Al-Jafari) published a front-page editorial about the developments of the political process in Iraq:  "Without a doubt, the major developments that Iraq has witnessed after the elections have provided good reasons for the neighboring countries to reconsider their relationships with Iraq. Among these developments include the formation of an elected government and the continued forward progress of the political process. The neighboring countries must help Iraq by making progress in four major portfolios. The first portfolio revolves around stabilizing security because this issue provides the foundation of the Iraqi political process. Indeed, stabilizing security at the present time is extremely important because this stage will witness the constitution-drafting process, which will ultimately lead to stabilization in Iraq. The second portfolio for these neighboring countries is to open embassies in Iraq. This issue has become increasingly important, especially after the formation of an elected Iraqi government that has the ability to act on an equal footing with its neighbors. For this reason, we call on the neighboring countries to enlarge their diplomatic representation in Iraq.  The third portfolio concerns the issue of debt. The neighboring countries must cancel the debts owed to them because these debts belong to the former regime. Our neighbors must cancel these debts because Iraq is unable to pay them. In addition, canceling these debts will improve Iraq's relationships with these countries. The fourth portfolio that requires action on the part of Iraq's neighbors is reconstruction. The neighboring countries will certainly benefit from participating in the reconstruction of Iraq and it will pave the way for further cooperation. If the neighboring countries do not participate in Iraq's reconstruction, other countries from outside the region will certainly seize upon this opportunity. In closing, we call on the neighboring countries to develop good relations with Iraq. We hope that these relationships will satisfy the willpower of the Arab people and ensure mutual Arab cooperation that is based on the unity of language, religion, and destiny."  SATTERFIELD

(C) On June 8, DCM conveyed REFTEL A demarche points regarding Syrian participation at EU - U.S. Brussels Conference to Minister of Foreign Affairs Zebari.  Zebari said the ITG was in agreement with the U.S. proposed strategy on how to manage Syria and had already laid the necessary groundwork in a recent meeting with the EU.  Zebari also offered that he was not worried about Syrian misbehavior at the upcoming Brussels Conference and predicted Syria would not cause any problems.  ----------------------------------------- SYRIA WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT CHALLENGES -----------------------------------------  3. (C) Discussing recent events in Syria, Zebari opined that even the governmental changes announced at the recently held Ba'ath Party Congress would have little or no impact on Syria's approach to international affairs.  They are set in their ways and will not open their system to change said Zebari.  Zebari said the Syrians approached the ITG a number of times already, but the Iraqis have rejected these overtures because the Syrians will give "very, very little" in return for our cooperation.  4. (C) DCM emphasized that Iraq has a great deal of leverage with Syria at the moment because of its internal problems and that this leverage should be used to help force the release of Iraqi assets held in Syria and to demand that Syria close its border with Iraq to insurgents.  Zebari concurred with DCM's sense that it would be impossible to close the borders without Syrian cooperation.  -------------------------------------------- ZEBARI SEES NEED FOR A MORE ACTIVE U.S. ROLE --------------------------------------------  5. (C) Asked to clarify his recent statements in Washington regarding the need for more U.S. engagement in Iraqi governmental affairs, Zebari stated that the U.S. had swung between two extremes during the last two years and the next few months called for a more involved posture by he U.S.  The U.S. must engage the  political leadership in a pro-active manner during the run up to the August 15 constitution drafting deadline said Zebari or risk having the process delayed and the insurgency take control.  "UNSCR 1546 authorizes the U.S. to take this role," said Zebari, "and we ask for your help during this critical period."  6. (C) DCM emphasized that the U.S. is already highly engaged with Iraq's political leadership on this vital issue and that the U.S. will continue to do all it can to help the ITG meet the August 15 drafting deadline.  ------------------------ INTERNAL GOVERNMENT RIFT ------------------------  7. (C) Discussing the governance issues detailed in REF B, Zebari stated that Prime Minister Jafari was not abiding by the formal agreement reached between the Kurds and List 169 during the ITG's formation and that he hoped that the matter could be resolved constructively.  Zebari suggested that Talabani's memorandum addressing the issue should not be presented to Jafari but only used to guide the discussion because it would only cause increased resistance to a settlement by Jafari.  There are many important issues this government must address stated Zebari and this issue is standing in the way of helping the Iraqi people with their problems.  -------------------------------------------- JUNE 21 - 22 BRUSSELS CONFERENCE PREPARATIONS --------------------------------------------  8. (C) DCM stressed the need to speak with a unified voice at the Brussels Conference and to have a persuasive and well-structured set of presentations that would portray Iraq in the most favorable light possible.  The DCM also encouraged Zebari to ensure all matters were well coordinated throughout the government, especially with the PM's office. Zebari agreed with the DCM and offered that he had just hosted a planning meeting with all high-level Iraqi participants going to the Conference including the MOD, MOI, MOF, MOJ, MOPDC, MOT, and the Central Bank's President. Zebari stressed that he was very comfortable with how their preparations were coming and that the same group would meet June 13 to again review the status of their progress.  9. (C) The MFA will serve as the lead agency for planning and coordination for the Conference indicated Zebari and revealed that he had also formed a working-level group at the Deputy Minister level to handle the day-to-day planning and preparations for the Conference.  Zebari emphasized that Iraq's delegation would be representative of all Iraqis and would include people from both inside and outside the government including representatives from the IIP, KRG and politicians such as Adnan Pacachi.  ------------------- IRAQI UN ARREARAGES -------------------  10. (C) Zebari indicated that Iraq owes the United Nations approximately $20 million in unpaid dues and requested our assistance in determining whether this debt could be paid from Iraq's escrow account.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002453  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/2025 TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EAID, PGOV, PREL, IZ, SY, LE, ECON Development, Parliament, Reconstruction SUBJECT: IRAQ: MINISTER OF FINANCE ON POLITICAL DYNAMICS, BRUSSELS CONFERENCE, JEC, AND SYRIA/LEBANON ASSET RECOVERY  REF: STATE 106124  Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (S) SUMMARY: Describing his take on current maneuvering within the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG), Finance Minister Allawi told the DCM June 8 he does not think Prime Minister Ja'afari has done a good job in articulating a clear political position and is having difficulty managing the government.  Allawi, who referred to himself and Planning Minister Saleh as "cat's paws" in a larger political game between Shia and Kurdish political figures, said he hopes a final decision on where responsibility for donor coordination will fall will be made within a few days.  In any event, Allawi stressed he and Saleh will work closely together to make a successful Iraqi showing at the Brussels Conference. In reply to the DCM's delivery of reftel talking points on the importance of substantive reform deliverables for Brussels and the JEC, Allawi noted he has already pitched a strategy for reductions in food and fuel subsidies to the Council of Ministers.  MoF will try to re-engage with Syria on return of frozen assets and provide Embassy with a detailed read out of the problems it is encountering in recovering the $140 million in assets that remain frozen in Lebanese commercial banks.  END SUMMARY.  ---------------- BOSNIAN SOLUTION ----------------  2. (S) During a frank and open discussion with the DCM on June 8, also attended by Treasury Attache and econoff, Minister of Finance Allawi shared his thoughts on the current state of debate within the ITG as to Iraq's political future.  While stressing it is too early to make definitive judgments as to what can be constituted a trend, Allawi observed, it is possible that Iraq may be headed, whether by design or not, towards some kind of "Bosnian solution."  Sunni Arabs are not yet fully adjusted to their loss of status, but appear resigned to the existence of a Kurdish Federation.  Few Kurds view Iraq as a natural, long-term entity, but are prepared to give short-term support to the political process as long as their principal interests and conditions are met.  The Shias, for their part, are prepared to concede much to get a resolution to political stalemate, but will not go so far as to accept an inequitable "Muslim-Croat" form of power division.  3. (S) Allawi said he would only give the performance of the ITG a C minus rating.  Noting in the Prime Minister's defense that he has only been in power for a few weeks, Allawi stressed that Ja'afari has nevertheless failed thus far to articulate a clear political position and vision.  He commented that Ja'afari is overloaded with trying to achieve too many goals, rather than focus on a few that are doable, a similar trap that the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) fell victim to.  The ITG also suffers from over-centralization of decision-making authority within the Prime Minister's office and micro-management of even relatively minor administrative issues.  -------------------- POLITICAL CAT'S PAWS --------------------  4. (S) Noting that Ja'afari still has many issues to work out with the Kurds, Allawi said Shias are divided in terms of how they see relations with the Kurds developing.  One view, represented by Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) leader Abdul Aziz Hakim, is that the Kurds should be developed as long-term allies.  Others, however, do not want to see the ITG made hostage to Kurdish demands. Vice President and SCIRI member Adel Mahdi is very close to the Kurds.  Mahdi's candidacy to head the ITG was withdrawn, Allawi continued, when SCIRI decided it would be best not to have to take responsibility for a short-term government. Dawa leader Ja'afari, on the other hand, was persistent in his pursuit of the position ad it became clear that there would be no viable alternative to Ja'afari.  5. (S) Referring to himself and Planning Minister Saleh as "cat's paws" in a larger political game, of which the struggle over which ministry is to control the donor assistance portfolio is just a small reflection, Allawi said he thinks there is a better than even chance (60/40) the issue will be resolved within two days.  According to Allawi, Ja'afari is likely to "capitulate" to the Kurds and allow the function to remain with Saleh as he will be unwilling to risk the success of his government over the issue.  Allawi characterized Ja'afari's political style as one that always leaves room for maneuvering, something that is sometimes misinterpreted as being indecisive.  In fact, Ja'afari enjoys and is good at high stakes political poker.  With regard to PM spokesmen Laith Kubba, who has been less than careful in a number of public statements (e.g., charges against Saddam and Iraqi debt write-off), Allawi speculated that Ja'afari may have had some unknown, byzantine reason for giving Kubba the position.  He added that Kubba is not trusted at all by the Kurds.  6. (C) As he has "no ego involved" in the outcome, Allawi stressed that, if a political resolution of the donor coordination debate within the ITG is not achieved soon, he will work out a mutually agreeable arrangement directly with Saleh with whom he personally gets along very well.  The DCM interjected it is critical that Allawi and Saleh be united and be prepared to present a strong message of the ITG's commitment to economic reforms.  To lose the opportunity Brussels represents to line up international support would be a major setback for the ITG.  The United States will do everything possible to make the conference a major success, but in the end it will be up to Iraq.  The DCM added that the ITG Ministers of Defense and Interior have committed to work together closely.  Acknowledging the DCM's comments, Allawi remarked an agreement to coordinate efforts for the Brussels Conference had been reached by the relevant ministers during a meeting earlier in the day at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  7. (C) With regard to division of responsibility on donor coordination issues, Allawi said a "technical solution" would be to spin off to MoF the capital budget function of the Ministry of Planning and Donor Coordination (MoPDC) and establish donor coordination as a new unit under the Prime Minister's office to be headed by Saleh.  Such a solution would help Ja'afari to save face since he has already announced publicly that donor coordination would go to MoF. The new unit would be responsible for accelerating the flow of aid and project implementation.  Allawi said that Saleh himself favors dismantling the MoPDC.  Its remaining functions could serve to perform data collection and statistical analysis.  --------------------- PREPARING FOR THE JEC ---------------------  8. (C) Transitioning to the topic of the upcoming Joint Economic Commission to be held in Amman in July, the DCM delivered reftel talking points (a copy of which was left with Allawi as a non-paper).  He stressed the high-level composition of the US delegation and noted the success of Iraqi participation will be judged by how much progress on economic reform can be announced.  Allawi, the DCM reiterated, should come prepared to announce subsidy cuts in Brussels, in preparation for the JEC.  At a minimum, it is imperative Iraq's intent to proceed with specific cuts be declared.  9. (C) In response, Allawi noted he has already been doing the groundwork for cuts in food and fuel subsidies and discussed his thinking at a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers.  While there is consensus within the ITG that reform of Iraq's system of subsidies is critical, some in the government are wary about the lack of a sufficient social safety net and any raise in fuel prices at a time of political stress.  Many Iraqis already pay higher prices for gasoline on the black market, but many others still wait in line to get it for free.  Allawi believes he will be able to achieve political agreement to proceed with phased-in increases in the price of gasoline, leading to a 20 percent cut in expenditures in fuel subsidies, a measure that should satisfy the IMF Iraq is being faithful to its Emergency Post Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) commitments.  10. (C) As to cutting the cost of the Public Distribution System, Allawi said he favors eliminating some of the items currently handed out and focusing the system on key commodities only, thereby saving up to $500 million.  Allawi agreed with the DCM that from a budgetary standpoint, there is little wriggle room for Iraq to meet large security expenditure needs except through subsidy cuts.  Allawi also concurred on the importance of close budget coordination with the Ministries of Defense and Interior and the need to protect pipeline infrastructure so that oil revenues are not lost.  --------------------- ASSET RECOVERY: SYRIA ---------------------  11. (C) Reviewing with the DCM the status of Iraq's asset recovery discussions with Syria and Lebanon, Allawi confirmed nothing substantive has taken place since the return of an Iraqi technical team in mid-April.  Out of an almost $2 billion in total Iraqi frozen assets abroad, Syria holds the largest single share at $262 million. (Note: although a specific amount was not given, Allawi also noted Bahrain for its holdings of Irqi assets.  End note).  Despite requests in writing from Iraq to do so, Syria has refused to transfer any of the funds from the Commercial Bank of Syria or the $71 million sitting in its Lebanese subsidiary, the Syrian-Lebanese Commercial Bank.  12. (C) Allawi said he was thinking of advising Prime Minister Ja'afari to try to solve the issue personally in Syria, but concurred with the DCM's recommendation that it would make more sense for Iraq to send a technical team.  The Syrians are extremely isolated diplomatically and would likely try to turn a Ja'afari visit to their political advantage.  Iraq should hold Syria's feet to the fire and insist upon agreement of asset transfer and an actual significant flow of funds before any high-level visits to Damascus are considered.  Especially in light of Syria's looming June 15 deadline to achieve progress on this and other issues or face potential Section 311 sanctions, the DCM continued, now is a perfect time for Iraq to press for resolution of the issue.  Allawi agreed and noted the DCM's comments came at a timely moment.  ----------------------- ASSET RECOVERY: LEBANON -----------------------  13. (C) Allawi said Lebanese banks still hold approximately $140 million out of what had once been $300 million in Iraqi frozen assets.  He asserted it is not true that Iraq has not contacted the Lebanese Central Bank Governor about the assets.  The difficulty in getting the assets back appears to be that the Lebanese banks (e.g., Mourad and First Bank of Lebanon) that hold the Iraqi ministerial accounts do not operate according to strictly international standards and appear to be trying to bargain over transfer terms.  The DCM volunteered the USG is willing to assist, but it would be necessary to have specific information on a bank-by-bank basis as to the problems Iraq is running into in Lebanon. The USG has been receiving very conflicting information over whether the ITG had or had not requested transfer of funds in Lebanese commercial banks.  Allawi agreed that there was internal ITG confusion on the issue which needs to be resolved and indicated he would try to work with the Central Bank and get us visibility on DFI account information to analyze possible transfers into it of frozen assets.  14. (C) COMMENT: Embassy will follow up soonest with the head of MoF's asset recovery team to determine what specific steps the Ministry intends to take next week on recovery of Iraqi assets from Syria.  Embassy will also engage the Central Bank directly.  END COMMENT.  15. (U) REO Hillah, REO Basra, REO Kirkuk, and REO Mosul minimize considered. Jeffrey

Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (U) PARTICIPANTS:  U.S. ---- DEPUTY SECRETARY ZOELLICK CHARGE D'AFFAIRES JAMES JEFFREY DCM DAVID SATTERFIELD AMBASSADOR JONES CHRISTINE DAVIES ROBERT WALLER ADAM ERELI SCOTT CARPENTER  IRAQ ---- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AHMED CHALABI  2. (S/NF) SUMMARY: In a May 19 meeting with the Deputy Secretary, Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi noted limited  SIPDIS progress on the constitution and voiced concern about meeting the August 15 deadline and including Sunnis in a credible way.  He also opined that sectarian violence is a more serious problem than is portrayed publicly and said he has met Sunni leaders to discuss jointly condemning sectarian strife.  Chalabi noted Iraq also faces serious economic challenges.  Chalabi agreed with the Deputy Secretary on the need to adjust pricing structures, but noted legislative opposition to the idea.  Other problems include bureaucrats who are reverting to socialist tendencies and the undeveloped agricultural and banking sectors.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- ----- CONCERNED ABOUT CONSTITUTION AND SECTARIAN VIOLENCE --------------------------------------------- -----  3. (S/NF) In response to the Deputy Secretary's questions on Iraq's political process, DPM Chalabi said he feared Iraqis were making little progress on the constitution.  Sunni participation was weak and there was no agreement on a mechanism for their credible inclusion.  Chalabi asserted he is pushing the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) to add 14-15 members to the existing 55-member constitutional committee of the Transitional National Assembly (TNA).  PM Ja'fari is on board and the Sadrists could be persuaded as well, however SCIRI leader 'Abd al Aziz al-Hakim remains opposed to the idea.  Sunni Deputy Prime Minister 'Abid Mutlak al-Jabburi has credible names to include on the committee and Chalabi claimed he is also working to persuade the Iraqi Islamic Party and the Muslim Ulama Council to sign on to the expanded committee.  (Note: Leaders of the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party have separately told Poloffs they support the idea.  End note.)  Chalabi mentioned he will see Muslim Ulama Council spokesma Haet al-Dhari next week, with whom Chalabi said he has personal rapport because of past political connections between al-Dhari's father and Chalabi's brother.  4. (S/NF) The Deputy Secretary stressed the importance of making the August 15 constitution deadline to avoid giving opportunities to terrorists to exploit.  He asked whether the TNA was making progress to meet the deadline.  Chalabi replied that he is concerned about the slow speed - the process needs organization and a plan, but the committee had no "movers" to set action plans.  Using the TAL as a basis would accelerate the process somewhat, although he believes the Kurds' internal squabbling is also delaying movement.  5. (S/NF) On the Deputy Secretary's question about sectarian violence, Chalabi said it was a very serious problem that was under-reported.  Chalabi claimed approximately 15-20 people are killed each day; Iraqis are moving out of their neighborhoods to escape this increasing violence.  Chalabi believes terrorists are inciting sectarian violence to de-legitimize the government and derail the democratic process.  6. (S/NF) Controlling entrances to Baghdad would help to contain infiltrating terrorists, suggested Chalabi. Extremists are killing Shia on their way to Karbala and Najaf; as payback, the Shia are killing Sunnis in Baghdad. (NOTE: Charge pointed out the Ministry of Interior has a new plan to patrol the 23 entrances to Baghdad; however, the plan does not extend to Babil province, which lies between the Shia heartland and Baghdad.  END NOTE)  Chalabi opined that encouraging citizens to use the highway rather than the smaller, more dangerous roads would also diminish the number of incidents. 7. (S/NF) Chalabi underscored the importance of getting Sunni and Shia leaders to condemn the sectarian strife.  He is holding discussions with Sunni Endowment leader Adnan al-Dulaymi and the Iraqi Islamic Party on issuing a joint statement denouncing sectarian strife.  Chalabi is not sure the Muslim Ulama Council (MUC) will join the initiative given their recent public statements that have heightened tensions.  Chalabi highlighted the problem of Sunni leadership.  His efforts to date have been focused on bringing Sunni religious and tribal leaders into the process, but Chalabi noted the bulk of Sunnis are not in these categories.  There needs to be outreach to the professional and technocratic cadre.  Only one Sunni minister, the Minister of Women's Affairs, Azhar Abd al Karim al-Shaykhli, fits into this category, opined Chalabi.  8. (S/NF) Iraqis would soon find the Shia/Sunni divide less important than the division between Arabs and Kurds, predicted Chalabi.  Mosul is "explosive" due to Kurdish encroachment, and Arabs also fear the Kurds are taking over the city of Sinjar in Ninewa province.  Chalabi noted that a key task is to instill in Kurds the notion they are part of Iraq, while restraining them from assuming disproportionate power.  --------------------------------------------- ----- ECONOMIC PRIORITIES: PROVIDE SERVICES, UP REVENUES --------------------------------------------- -----  9. (S/NF) Chalabi remarked on Iraq's abysmal economic situation, with $36 billion spent since the fall of the regime resulting in no improvements.  He said problems are clearly not fixed by "throwing money at them," and the corruption problem has exacerbated conditions.  (NOTE: Chalabi noted the Board of Supreme Audit recently released a report on corruption within the Defense Ministry.  END NOTE)  10. (S/NF) Chalabi said government priorities should be to provide services: electricity, sewage, and water.  For electricity, the current goal is four hours on, one hour off.  Iraq has the reserve capacity of 11,000 megawatts, but it currently generates only 4,200 megawatts.  Two years have failed to improve this output, complained Chalabi.  As a short-term solution, the government has focused on using expensive fuel.  Currently Iraq is importing 4 million liters per day of diesel fuel costing $150 million/month to power generators.  11. (S/NF) The Deputy Secretary suggested that Iraq could harness the estimated $5 billion of natural gas currently flared to power electricity generators rather than crude oil - and thus free up oil for export.  Fuel pricing structures need to be adjusted, added the Deputy Secretary.  Chalabi agreed, noting that gasoline is basically free (50 dinar or 3 cents per liter) and diesel is even cheaper than gasoline. Electricity is also free since the collection process is more expensive than the governmental income that would be gained by collecting tariffs, complained Chalabi.  One idea is to charge citizens for extra usage after a minimum amount. Chalabi said he and the Finance Minister support adjusting pricing structures, but the UIA remains reluctant.  He suggested the USG could help educate UIA parliamentarians by leading a seminar for the TNA on economic incentives. Chalabi would also like to cut food subsidies, at least partially.  Ending subsidies for soap and beans, for example, would save $500 million per year.  12. (S/NF) Iraq's second economic priority should be to increase revenues through oil exports, but Iraq suffers from both production and export problems, noted Chalabi.  Iraq only exports 1.4 million barrels per day.  Iraq could increase exports from Kirkuk, but would need security for the pipeline.  For example, the oil pipeline through Mosul is under threat, and it would require 18 fully trained and equipped battalions to protect it.  Iraq loses $600 million a month because the northern export lines are unprotected and not functioning.  In addition, Iraq's oil refining capability is half what it needs to be; the country needs 20 million liters gas per day and must import 10-11 million liters per day.  13. (S/NF) The country's economic problems are exacerbated by an increasing tendency (on the part of bureaucrats rather than ministers) to revert to socialist practices, continued Chalabi.  Because of their experience, the bureaucrats' default response defies to enact protectionist tariffs and to restrict the percentage of foreign investment.  Not one economic activity in Iraq is profitable, including agriculture, which is heavily subsidized, yet their inclination is to increase subsidies to address the problem, complained Chalabi.  --------------------------------------------- ------- ADDITIONAL SECTORS: AGRICULTURE, BANKS, JOB CREATION --------------------------------------------- ------- 14. (S/NF) Chalabi noted two issues affecting the agricultural sector: land ownership and irrigation.  Iraq needs to farm large tracts of land to have a profitable agro-sector.  However, there is still a law preventing private land ownership of more than 800 hectares.  Modern irrigation techniques are needed, but such improvements are capital intensive.  Banks present a unique challenge with less then 500 operating branches in Iraq -- one branch per 40,000 Iraqis.  15. (S/NF) The Deputy Secretary asked about the usefulness of micro-credit loan programs in Iraq, to which Chalabi responded that such a program would help greatly since it "is impossible to get loans now."  Chalabi said agriculture and services were key elements to creating jobs, much more than manufacturing.  Expanding housing would also create immediate jobs.  Most land belongs to the government, which it could section off for residential areas that would create jobs in construction.  Further, increasing home ownership would contribute to political stability.  Chalabi also asked to increase the number of scholarships to the U.S. and subscriptions to useful periodicals.  16. (U) The Deputy Secretary's office cleared on this cable.  17. (U) Minimize considered for REOs Basrah, Hillah, Kirkuk, and Mosul. Jeffrey

Neumann for reason 1.4 (b)   1. (C) SUMMARY: The ITG is disorganized and ineffective according to Rubaie.  He characterized the government as in crisis with the Kurds provoked especially by the absence of any mention of federalism in the Prime Ministers State of the Union message.  Additionally, Talabani is angry about the responsibilities of Finance Minister Allawi, which have included subjects he and Barham Salih wanted in the Ministry of Planning with Salih. Rubaie also doubts that the Prime Minister understands the political nature of the insurgency. Therefore his political strategy for dealing with it is inadequate.  Rubaie may have failed to cement his personal relationship with Ja'afari and that could be underlying his analysis but he is clearly much less happy with the Ja'afari government than he was a month ago.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) A month ago Rubaie was full of optimism for the new government.  Now he is pessimistic.  In a meeting with PolMilCons Neumann June 8, Rubaie characterized Ja'afari as disorganized and particularly condemned his lack of any approach to building institutions, something Rubaie is keen on.  He said the lack of meetings of the Ministerial Council for National Security (MCNS) is simply because the Prime Minister does not understand its value or who needs to be involved in national security issues.  Among the cabinet committees recently composed is one on defense and security (unlike the MCNS the cabinet committees do not involve the coalition or principal allies).  However the cabinet security committee did not include the Chief of Intelligence or the Foreign Minister.  Rubaie caustically asked how the Foreign Minister could accurately represent policy if he was not involved in it when security was so fundamental to relations with the neighbors.  Rubaie also condemned Ja'afari for not listening, that he gives lengthy explanations, is difficult to talk to and does not respond to argument.  3. (C) Rubaie characterized the relations with the Kurds as a crisis (we have reported this in more detail septels).  He said both Talabani and Barzani were furious that Rubaie's State of the Union message had no mention of federalism. Additionally, Talabani is angry that Finance Minister Allawi rather than Planning Minister Barham Salih has the lead for planning for Brussels.  Rubaie knew about Talabani's meeting on the same day with Abdul Aziz Hakim to figure out how to deal with Ja'afari.  4. (C) Ja'afari said the Prime Minister is making no use of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS) director. Contrary to what Chalabi said last week, Rubaie said that INIS Director Sharwani is making frequent attempts to be in touch with the Prime Minister and to offer him briefings. However the Prime Minister does not respond.  Rubaie said that he is in regular touch with Sharwani who is very frustrated.  Rubaie went on to say that none of the Deputy Prime Ministers or members of the Presidency Council receive any regular flow of information.  Rubaie has offered to provide a weekly intelligence briefing to each of the Deputy Prime Ministers and is now making the same offer to the two Vice Presidents and President Talabani.  Rubaie said that he has regular conversations with a SCIRI senior advisor and Iraqi Vice President Adil Abdel-Mahdi who is frustrated at the incoherence of the government.  (COMMENT:  As an alternative candidate for Prime Minister Abdel-Mahdi is not quite a disinterested observer.  END COMMENT)  Rubaie questioned whether Ja'afari really understands the nature of the insurgency.  He quoted Ja'afari and a separate conversation with Minister of State for National Security Al-Anzi.  Each one of them apparently said that given a free hand they could clean up the insurgency in two or three months.  Rubaie explained that what they meant was that the insurgency was based solely on die-hard Ba'athists and criminals who would give up or run away if faced with sufficient force.  Rubaie does not accept this characterization of the insurgency.  He thinks it is far more complex and more political.  The Jihadists won't give up and there is an element within the insurgency that sincerely believes it is fighting to rid the country of a foreign occupier.  Rubaie said that without the proper understanding of the nature of the insurgency it is extremely difficult or impossible for Ja'afari to build an adequate political strategy to deal with it.  5. (C) COMMENT: It is possible that Rubaie has failed to get some position or policy he wants adopted and that his analysis is affected with sourness as a result.  However it is also true that Rubaie has an abiding and sometimes unrealistic desire to build institutions and go beyond personal politics.  He is therefore all the more frustrated that Ja'afari is uninterested in building systems and is constructing instead a government centralized completely on himself with chaotic staffing procedures.  END COMMENT. Jeffrey

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Despite promising signs earlier this week, negotiations over expanding the Constitution Drafting Committee deadlocked on June 9 over the number of Sunni Arabs who should be added.  Some Sunni Arabs are demanding 25 additional representatives of their community on the 55-member committee while Shia and Kurdish leaders say they will allow no more than 15.  The Shia want to preserve their majority on the committee and the Kurds do not want the Sunni Arabs to outnumber them.  Even if the numbers argument were resolved, further landmines remain: some Shia and Kurdish committee members say they want to vet the nominees for Ba'athist ties and make them publicly denounce violence.  All parties want this dispute resolved quickly and say they are at least open to USG mediation.  A strategy for such mediation is laid out at the end of this cable.  END SUMMARY.   2. (C) Negotiations over Sunni Arab inclusion in Constitution Drafting committee hit a snag on June 9 over the question of how many Sunni Arabs should be added.  Sunni Waqf leader Adnan al-Dulaymi announced publicly on June 8 that he believed there should be 25 Sunni Arabs added to the body. President Talabani also indicated PUK support for 25 additional Sunni Arabs in a June 8 meeting with the Charge. That partial consensus fell through June 9 when KDP and Shia leaders both rejected the number as too high.  The PUK may also have retrenched.  Sunni Arab leaders are sticking to their call for twenty-five additional representatives. Dulaymi, in a conversation with Poloff on June 9, shouted over the phone, "No compromise!"  -------------------------- THE CONFLICTING RATIONALES --------------------------  3. (C) Poloff's conversations with negotiators on all sides of this dispute reveal the following set of conflicting rationales:  -- SHIA RATIONALE: Shia leaders wants to maintain the same 51 percent majority on the Constitutional Committee that they hold in the TNA and, they say, in the country.  They currently hold 28 seats on the 55-member committee. (NOTE: They can count on independent Shia Islamist Sami al-Askari siding with them on most issues, so some might say they hold 29 seats.  END NOTE)  -- KURDISH RATIONALE: Kurdish activists, particularly from the KDP, believe they outnumber Sunni Arabs in Iraq and should outnumber them on the committee.  The Kurdistan Alliance List holds 15 seats on the committee (NOTE: They can count on independent Shia Communist Hamid Musa siding with them on most issues, so some might say they hold 16 seats. END NOTE)  -- SUNNI ARAB RATIONALE: Sunni Arabs promoting the appointment of 25 representatives, in addition to the two Sunni Arabs already on the committee, say they would be accepting less than their share.  Many of them say they represent over 40 percent of the population, which would entitle them to 32 seats on an 80-member body.  Instead they are accepting 27 seats, which is only 34 percent of the seats.  Some have more moderate ambitions but have rejected the previously publicized idea of adding 13 members because they believe the number is being forced on them.  ------------------------------ FURTHER COMPLICATIONS POSSIBLE ------------------------------  4. (C) Even if the numbers dispute were resolved, other obstacles to Sunni Arab inclusion may lie on the horizon. All key committee leaders have told us that they accept the notion that added Sunni representatives would act as equal members on the committee.  Senior politicians have told us they accept the principle of consensus, not voting, as the means of decision-making on the Committee.  They also agree that Sunni Arab representatives have to be chosen by Sunni leaders.  Hamudi and others say to emboffs they want a vetting process to insure that they are clean of Ba'athist ties.  Here they cite the same law that regulates who may serve as a member of the Transitional National Assembly. This vetting process could proceed without incident, but it could easily lead to personal disputes.  5. (C) Chaldo-Assyrian committee member Yunadam Kanna told Poloff June 9 that he thinks it might be appropriate to make all Sunni Arab inductees to the committee publicly foreswear violence.  Kanna also warned that he would sooner have the constitutional committee choose its Sunni Arabs additions itself rather than accept nominees that are likely to obstruct the process.  TNA Deputy Speaker and leading KDP member Arif Taifur argued to Poloff that the Sunni demand for 25 seats is deliberately excessive and represents an early effort to obstruct the process.  ----------------------- READY FOR U.S. PRESSURE -----------------------  6. (C) All parties to the dispute want this dispute resolved quickly, within days.  Faced with a dispute that may be beyond the authorities of Adnan al-Janabi's low-level Sunni outreach committee, leaders from all sides have been talking and gathering intermittently but without progress so far. Representatives of all sides to this dispute have said that U.S. pressure might help in brokering a solution.  Even Sunni Waqf leader Adnan al-Dulaymi told Poloff he saw value in such intervention.  ------------------------- COMMENT: GETTING TO "YES" -------------------------  7. (C) Allowing this dispute to fester would endanger efforts to meet the August 15 deadline and spread doubt about the legitimacy of the constitution drafting process.  Even if these leaders resolve the dispute over representation, they still have major constitutional debates ahead of them.  In short, this dispute could cost time, spread rancor, and bring us no closer to a draft constitution.  8. (C) Compromise appears possible based on the addition to the Constitutional Committee of some 15 additional Sunni Arabs.  KDP leader Arif Taifur, committed to 13, told Poloff after a lengthy conversation that he might consider going to 15 as a stretch.  SCIRI leader and Constitution Committee Chairman Hamudi begrudgingly made the same concession in a separate conversation.  We have heard from Vice President Abd al-Mehdi that Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party leaders are willing to settle for 15-20 added members.   Sunni Arab outreach leader Adnan al-Janabi previously told the DCM that he thought 15 additions would be a reasonable number.  Adnan Dulaymi, when Poloff sounded him out, is going to be an obstacle, as will his allies on the National Dialogue Council, but if Janabi can be prevailed upon, they are likely to settle as well.  9. (C) Embassy is engaging with all parties to press for a rapid resolution based on inclusion of an additional 15 Sunni members, with no "loyalty" pledge.  10. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered. Jeffrey

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002463  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PTER, IZ SUBJECT: FALLUJAH CITY COUNCIL SELECTS MAYOR  Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Henry S. Ensher.  Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  The Fallujah City Council selected Sheikh Dhari Abd Alhadi Yousif al-Ersan as mayor in a June 7 session.  Four candidates put their names forward for the job (two were absent from the meeting); Sheikh Dhari received 16 of 17 council votes cast by secret ballot.  The selection process led to complaints (and a subsequent walk-out) of four Fallujah residents who complained that the new mayor should be directly elected by the people, not by its council members.  The city council also welcomed Brigadier General Salah (Deputy Commander, Public Order Brigade) in his new role as City Police Chief, and noted that the weekly Ministry of Industry and Minerals-led Monday reconstruction meetings would be merged with the regularly scheduled city council sessions.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------- MAYOR OF FALLUJAH:  SHEIKH DHARI --------------------------------  2.  (C) In a well-organized and succinct city council session, members elected Sheikh Dhari Abd Alhadi Yousif al-Ersan as mayor.  Four candidates put their name forward for the city's top job.  The council's Vice-Chairman, Qassem Mohammed Abdulsttar al-Jassem, opened the meeting by speaking to the issue of democracy as a principle of governance.  He noted that the term democracy was a Greek word, which meant that people were responsible; "they are in charge."  Iraq's citizens had suffered greatly "under the darkness" during the last years, but now needed to work toward unity.  They could not have separate parts of Iraq, he declared, "we are a whole."  Qassem made the following points:  --Fallujah is part of Iraq.  It cannot be divided from the country.  --The city had suffered considerably in the past, but there was now an opportunity for the city to take advantage of the new situation:  "we must fight against all forms of corruption, crime and bad works."  --Fallujans needed to work toward freeing many detainees.  ------------------------ CANDIDATES MAKE SPEECHES ------------------------  3.  (C) Qassem, in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the council, oversaw the mayoral election process. The four candidates' names had been listed on a nearby board; the two present -- Sheikh Dhari and Engineer Farouq Abdu Mohammed -- were offered the floor.  Dhari spoke only briefly, flagging his background as Colonel in the Iraqi Army.  Dhari also stated that he came from a main tribe in the region, the Zobai (Al- Zawbaa).  4.  (C) Farouq Abdu Mohammed, in contrast, spoke at length.  He highlighted that he had graduated from university in Baghdad with a chemistry degree, served as a lieutenant in the Iraqi army, and now was as a businessman.  Farouq offered a lengthy set of additional points on his civic priorities:  security as top concern; police from the area; more jobs; sewer, hospital and school repairs.  He stressed that Fallujah could serve as a bridge to the rest of Iraq as a "model city."  5.  (C) The other two candidates (Samir Rasheed and Jassem Mohamed Abid Al-Subayhe) did not attend the session; Qassem read a short biography on each.  Four residents in the audience interjected that Fallujah's mayor should be elected by the people of the city, not selected by the council.  This would represent real democracy.  Qassem reiterated that the stated selection process by council members would stand; the objecting residents then quietly left the room in protest.  6.  (C) Council members, numbering 17 present, cast secret ballots on slips of paper.  Sheikh Dhari  SIPDIS received 16 votes, Farouq Abdu Mohammed one vote.  The new mayor spoke briefly, thanking those present for their trust in him.  He said he did not want to talk a lot about himself but looked forward to working with the city and enjoying success in all areas.  7.  (C) The mayor's position in Fallujah has been vacant since Operation Al-Fajr (November 2004). Filling this vacuum in city governance constitutes an important step toward moving Fallujah into a more sustainable self-governance and reconstruction mode. In private conversations with PolOff, several local residents have expressed support for Sheikh Dhari.  8.  (C) Comment:  The Coalition's interaction with Sheikh Dhari has been limited.  He only recently became active in city governance issues with his selection in April as one of the tribal representatives on the council.  His transparent selection in an open session should help bestow legitimacy among city residents.  The new mayor has a big job ahead of him in Fallujah's challenging security and reconstruction environment.  This effort will require not only local support and political swagger, but also personal stamina.  Effective interaction with the Provincial Council in Ramadi will also be key to Sheikh Dhari's long-term success, changing Fallujans' traditional go-it-alone mindset.  9.

Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  State Minister Khadim for Civil Society  told PolOff on June 7 that despite his ministry's meager budget, he intends to maintain a robust travel schedule and meet with NGO leaders both in Baghdad and the provinces.  Khadim, a follower of Muqtada al Sadr, has met with Sunni and Shi'a tribal leaders in order to promote Sunni inclusion in the political process.  Rounding out his ambitious work plan, Khadim intends to actively participate in the constitution development process from both within government and through polling from the NGO community. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) On June 7, State Minister for Civil Society Affairs Ala'a Habib Khadim briefed PolOff on the status of his ministry and its latest initiates to promote Iraqi unity and social contributions of the NGO community.  Khadim reviewed the following key areas:  -- NGO CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE NEW IRAQ: Khadim said that Iraqi NGOs needs to focus their energies on positive contributions to the Iraqi people, suggesting that many NGOs are formed simply to win grants.  -- SUNNI AND SHI'A UNITY: Khadim said that on two occasions during the past two weeks, he met with Sunni and Shi'a tribal leaders to promote unity, Sunni inclusion in the political process, and to hear tribal grievances and concerns on behalf of the government. Principal grievances include high unemployment, unreasonable arrests, and the prevalence of water pollution.  The tribes also wish to relieve the ISF and MNF-I from their duties, and have asked Khadim to allow them to assume responsibility to enforce violations of law that occur in their respective areas, such as Al Anbar, Ninewa, Diwaniyah, Kut, An Najaf, and Samarra, among others.  Khadim stressed that the tribal leaders are in a better position to exert local control, and seek a larger role in reclaiming their communities from the insurgents. Khadim said he already presented a detailed plan to Prime Minister Ja'afari, and plans to see the PM as soon as possible to discuss possible courses of action.  Khadim said the role, as tribal interlocutor is a natural for his state ministry.  -- SPECIFIC CUES FROM MUQTADA AL-SADR: Khadim provided details regarding his recent meeting with Muqtada al- Sadr, pointing out that Muqtada specifically said he would not interfere with the business of his state ministry.  Khadim said that Muqtada provided him specific guidance on the conduct of his duties, telling him, "You are Iraq.  The Iraqi people elected (sic) you."  He said Muqtada advised him to "work hard and lift the burden of the Iraqi people", telling him work towards the "unification of the Iraqi people" through reconciliation between the Sunni and Shi'a. Muqtada also directed him to "ask the occupying forces" to leave Iraq.  Khadim considers Muqtada's instructions as entirely consistent to the purpose of his ministry.  -- CONSTITUTION PARTICIPATION AT SEVERAL LEVELS: Khadim explained that his ministry has a very specific role in the constitution development process.  First, he serves as a member of a "support committee" organized by the PM to assist the Constitution Committee.  Second, he serves as a member of an inter- ministerial constitution committee under the Council of Ministers.  Third, he intends to conduct "surveys" with the NGO community to coordinate civil society input directly to the Constitution Committee.  -- TALL ORDERS FOR MINIMALLY FUNDED MINISTRY: Khadim complained that he is still waiting for a response from the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers on his budget increase request, claiming that the Secretary General's bloated 1,100 member staff (only  SIPDIS 200 are needed, he claimed) has created an impossible bureaucracy.  Khadim said he submitted a budget plan that calls for the following: an NGO training center, several national unity conferences for Iraqi tribal leaders, conferences for NGOs, and publishing a monthly magazine.  Khadim stated his staff has finally cleared an initial backlog of 1,000 NGO registration application packages, and he plans to sign the individual certificates by the end of the week. Khadim also claims that international donors contributed USD 145 million for three specific ministries: Women, Human Rights, and his ministry. However, he stated, he cannot find any records that indicate his ministry has received any of this funding.  (Note: Post is researching the source and intent of these funds; there is nothing to indicate that any of these ministries received such funding. End note.) -- REVISIONS TO CPA ORDER 45: Khadim said he has talked with NGOs regarding revisions to CPA Order 45 ("NGO Order") in order to address "ambiguous parts" of the order.  While he does not believe a wholesale re- write is necessary, he does not discount that possibility.  However, he stated he intends to keep the changes focused on the subject of NGOs without venturing into general discussions of non-profit organizations.  3.  (C/NF) COMMENT. Khadim appears to be more proactive than his predecessor with respect to developing a strategy for active engagement with civil society and the NGO community (his predecessor could hardly explain a coherent strategy until the final days of his 8-month tenure).  Current staff levels and the budget shortfall will prevent Khadim from carrying out his stated objectives.  His focus on "shaping" the NGO community could mean attempts to assert government control over an NGO community whose mission includes democracy development and oversight of that same government.  On a positive note, his civil society outreach may prove to be the best mission his ministry could perform.  End comment.  4.

(U) THIS CABLE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST. PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 4-5.  2. (SBU) Post has learned through informal channels that UNAMI has proposed to the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights that UNAMI send a two-person delegation (John Pale, Chief Human Rights Officer, and Rasha al-Kasy, Human Rights Officer) to visit Coalition detention facilities at Camp Bucca on June 14.  MNF-I has not received official notification from UNAMI of UNAMI's intent to visit, and has indicated to MoHR that it considers the request deferred.  3. (SBU) We do not know what authority UNAMI intends to cite for its proposed inspection of Coalition detention facilities, although the identity of the inspectors suggests that UNAMI may seek this visit under the terms of UNSCR 1546, operative paragraph 7(b)(iii), which decides that UNAMI shall "promote the protection of human rights, national reconciliation, and judicial and legal reform in order to strengthen the rule of law in Iraq".  4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: It is not clear to Post or MNF-I that we are in a position to grant entities other than ICRC and the ITG access to detention facilities (as opposed to visits to individual detainees). It is also not clear to us that the ITG is in a position to arrange such access for third parties without MNF-I concurrence. We therefore request specific guidance from Washington as to how to proceed, and ask that this guidance come not later than COB Baghdad time Monday, June 13, 2005.  5. (SBU) Should Washington advise that UNAMI access be granted, we also seek clarification as to the terms on which the UNAMI visit will be conducted (i.e., whether UNAMI will adopt ICRC's standards of confidentiality and impartiality, whether "fair warning" of press statements will be given, as is the case with ICRC, and so on).  6.

Ensher for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: The Charge on June 10 made a firm presentation to SCIRI leader 'Abd al Aziz al-Hakim to end the drift and close a deal on adding Sunnis to the constitutional committee.  Charge noted that his presentation reflected the concern of the highest level of the USG.  Charge and DCM went over the same points described below with PM Jafari in a separate meeting June 10. The Charge suggested 15 Sunnis would be an appropriate compromise for all sides; there should not be conditions on or vetos on the names the Sunnis propose.  Al-Hakim agreed that the numbers were not important, noting only the difficulty of getting the Sunnis to agree among themselves.  He said the same principle of consensus that prevailed during earlier Iraqi political negotiations would prevail.  Constitutional Committee Chair Humam Hammudi said proposed individuals must meet the same criteria as TNA members.  Hammudi also expressed his displeasure at the recent presentation of a UN advisor who had referred to MNF-I as an occupation force and who had suggested an additional 25 Sunnis would be appropriate. Charge noted that the Committee should take only the advice it thought appropriate.  Post contacted the UN Constitutional adviser on this point.  He said there had been a misunderstanding of the UN position because of a bad translation and would correct the misunderstanding as soon as possible.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) The Charge and DCM visited SCIRI and United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) leader 'Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim at the SCIRI headquarters June 10.  Joining al-Hakim were his deputy and constitutional committee leader Humam al-Hammudi, Transitional National Assembly (TNA) member Akram al-Hakim, and Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim's son Ammar al-Hakim.  3. (C) The Charge stressed the need to finalize the composition of the constitutional committee now.  The Charge praised the outreach efforts of the Shia towards the Sunnis, especially given that the Shia are the elected members of the government.  The next step is to close a deal on Sunni participation in the constitutional process.  Charge noted his presentation reflected the concerns of the highest level of the USG.  The Charge said we would be urging compromise on all sides.  The Sunni demand for 25 committee members seems excessive to us; 15 is a compromise for all sides.  Moreover, the Charge suggested that other groups not place conditions on or veto the members the Sunnis choose, since the Sunnis need to feel the individuals represent them.  In addition, the USG expects the spirit of consensus rather than voting will guide the committee's decisions.  Charge and DCM made the same points to PM Jafari in a separate meeting June 10.   --------------------------------------------- ------ NUMBERS "NOT IMPORTANT"; SUNNI DIVISION COMPLICATES EFFORT--AS IS THE UNITED NATIONS --------------------------------------------- ------  4. (C) Al-Hakim responded that the numbers of Sunnis are "not so important, whether 13 or 15".  Al-Hakim assured the Charge the Shia will practice the same principles in the constitution that they did with forming the government. Al-Hakim noted the generosity of the Shia who, although they constitute 60-65 percent of Iraqi population, according to U.S. studies (NFI), had afforded the Sunnis many prominent posts in the government.  5. (C) Al-Hakim noted the difficulty in dealing with the Sunnis because they are divided.  Al-Hakim complained of the meeting between the constitutional committee and Sunni groups June 9 to discuss Sunni inclusion, which nearly descended into near physical confrontation between the Sunni IIP and National Dialogue (INDC) who accused each other of not truly representing Sunnis.  Al-Hakim noted the positive role the USG could play to temper the Sunnis.  Choosing Sunni candidates should not be so difficult, al-Hakim said, but the process should not entirely depend on Constitutional Committee Chairman Adnan al-Janabi, who is not widely accepted.  6. (C) Transitional National Assembly constitutional committee head and SCIRI deputy Shaykh Humam Hammudi claimed that most groups had been in favor of adding 15 Sunnis, but a UN advisor had complicated the process by proposing an additional 25 Sunnis.  The UN is "ruining the process", complained Hammudi, who also complained of a recent instance in which a UN member greeted Hammudi by expressing sympathy for Iraq living under MNF-I occupation.  Moreover, the UN had suggested the constitutional committee be the ultimate authority on the Constitution draft without any role for the TNA, ignoring the Transitional Administrative Law.  Charge said that the Committee is free to take or leave any advice it wants.  He suggested that Hakim and Hammudi might consider the greater weight of advice from friends, such as the U.S., that were sharing with Iraqis the sacrifices of the fight against terrorists.  Hakim agreed.  Post contacted UN constitutional adviser Haysom on June 10 to seek an explanation for the reported UN position.  Haysom said a bad translation in a UN non-paper might have caused a misunderstanding and the UN was neither advocating a particular number of Sunnis nor a process that would undercut the TNA.  He undertook to clarify the UN's views with Hammudi as soon as possible.  7. (C) COMMENT: The meeting with Hakim was the first of a round of calls to key representatives of all parties to the constitutional inclusion process.  We will press them all, as they have indicated they wished us to do, to finalize the composition of the constitutional committee.  SCIRI seemed very amenable to adding 15 Sunnis.  We tend to agree with them that much of the difficulty and delay lies with the Sunnis themselves and their inability to agree on candidates.  We will press Sunnis with the same message of flexibility and compromise.  END COMMENT.  8. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK minimize considered. Jeffrey

(C) Summary: In the aftermath of the mistaken arrest of Iraqi Islamic Party leader Dr. Muhsin Abdal Hamid, Post and MNF-I took steps to repair relations with the most prominent Sunni political party.  Hamid was detained in an early morning operation on May 30 and released that same day after it became apparent he was incorrectly targeted.  Charge Satterfield met IIP Secretary General Tariq al-Hashimi on June 1, to clarify the incident and convey our apologies. Acting Political Counselor visited IIP headquarters on June 5 to present a written apology directly to abd al-Hamid.  Later that day abd al-Hamid had a lunch meeting with both the Charge and MNF-I Commanding General Casey.  On June 6, MNF-I/Pol/Mil/Econ Deputy Commander and PolOffs again visited IIP headquarters to present compensation for damages and missing items from the home.  End Summary.  2. (C) U.S. military forces detained Dr. Muhsin Abdal Hamid in the early hours of May 30.  Hamid is the leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), Iraq's most prominent Sunni political party.  MNF-I continues to investigate the causes leading to the targeting of the former Governing Council President's home, but it appears it was simply a case of misdirection.  Hamid's detention created a stir among Baghdad's political class and the first 45 minutes of the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) session on May 31 was devoted to denunciations of the detention and offers of support for the IIP leader.  Though abd al-Hamid was released within 12 hours of the raid, Post and MNF-I took special measures to clarify the mistake and make amends with this sensitive, perhaps pivotal organization.  3. (C) Charge Satterfield met with IIP Secretary General Tariq al-Hashimi on June 1 to express regret over the detention and persuade party leaders that the incident was not deliberate.  Hashimi insisted the U.S. issue a written apology.  He queried whether the U.S. considers the IIP to be directly connected with insurgency.  If so, he demanded the U.S. bring any accusations to his party's intention so they might be allowed to refute any charges.  He added the party is in a very difficult position, and that the insurgents are "killing us before they kill you".  He noted the "Zarqawis" had burnt down the IIP headquarters in the western town of Hit.  Charge Satterfield assured Hashimi that the U.S. does not have any bias against his party and urged them to continue their positive role in the Iraqi political process. Hashimi closed by urging the Charge to visit IIP headquarters and to keep the lines of communication open.  4. (C) Acting PolCouns visited IIP headquarters on June 5 to explain the incident directly to abd al-Hamid and convey a written letter of apology, as is commonly expected in Iraqi society.  Secretary General Hashimi expressed appreciation for the letter and committed himself to improving relations with the U.S.  He, nonetheless, argued that such raids and mass arrests are incomprehensible to the party and its constituents.  He added that large-scale detentions are "undermining our credibility".  He also presented A/PolCouns a list of damaged and missing items from the Hamidi home.  5. (C) A/PolCouns urged the IIP leadership to use their influence with their constituents to cooperate and share intelligence about the terrorists with security forces.  This would be the best method of improving the precision of raids and targets for detention.  IIP leader Dr. Ayad Samarra'i emphasized there is no higher priority for the party than establishing a representative Constitutional Drafting Committee in a timely manner.  6. (C) Dr. abd al-Hamid recounted the raid to A/Polcouns.  He claimed the soldiers disregarded his attempt to present his current second tier International Zone badge and former President of the Governing Council identification and threw him to the floor, pressing a boot on his neck.  (NOTE: A knee to the upper back was the method used; apparently perceived to be a boot.  END NOTE)  He commented that this incident was neither in the IIP's interests nor in the USG's.  Hamid railed that his detention was an insult to him and his family.  He reiterated Hashimi's point that if the Coalition has suspicions of any IIP party members, we should approach the party with the charges and the IIP would strip the guilty member of his party membership.  7. (C) In a lunch given by Charge Satterfield and General Casey, the Charge again emphasized to abd al-Hamid that his detention was not a deliberate attack on his person, party or the role his party is playing in building a democratic Iraq. Abd al-Hamid summarized his reasons for believing he was indeed the target of the operation.  He insisted that if the Coalition ever wants to interrogate him on specific ties to the insurgency, all they had to do is send a car for him and he would appear for questioning.  He accepted the Charge's apology and expressed hope that such incidents would not be repeated.  General Casey reported he had assigned a general officer to investigate the erroneous detention and explained the unit involved had been seeking an individual with a similar name.  The unit had been to two prior locations and was finally misdirected to the Abd al-Hamid,s household by a bystander.  He appeared to accept this explanation.  8. (C) Abd al-Hamid related the IIP's role in the current effort to form a representative Constitutional Drafting Committee.  He said his party had put forward 30 names for the enlargement of the committee and all are specialists of the law.  His noted that Iraqis simply have to write a constitution by August 15 to ensure the December elections are not delayed.  Regarding election security, Secretary General Hashimi postulated that security cannot be improved through the use of excessive force.  He drew a distinction between terrorists (who pursue an international agenda) and "nationalists" who have a sincere desire to join the political process.  He urged the USG support confidence building measures to include: controlling the borders; opening a dialogue with the "nationalists"; releasing detainees who have no charges brought against them; and declaring a "reasonable" timeline for withdrawal of Coalition forces.  Charge Satterfield responded that the USG is doing all it can both militarily and diplomatically to address the issue of border security.  He told the IIP leadership that any use of violence as a political tool should be condemned as terrorism.  9. (C) Politically the situation appears to be resolved.  IIP leaders took PolOffs, phone calls on June 8 and the media furor seems to have died down.  On June 8 a CF officer in Baghdad (in the vicinity of the IIP headquarters) witnessed two Iraqis putting up anti-American posters with the IIP logo.  He spoke to them and took the placards.  One read, "The arrest of Dr. Mushin Abdal Hamid will not divert us from our path of liberating the country and throwing out the occupier", the second, "The arrest of Dr. Mushin is terrorism American-style".  On June 9, poloff returned a copy of the second placard to the IIP SecGen, who commented that all such placards have been removed.  Dealing with Sunni political groups will continue to be a challenge.  10. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered. Jeffrey 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002468  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2008 TAGS: IZ, MARR, MOPS, ECON, PREL, ENGR, Petrolium, Energy Sector SUBJECT: NATIONAL ENERGY COMMITTEE ASKS, "WHAT'S IMPEDING IRAQ'S OIL FLOW?"  Classified By: ACTING POLITICAL-MILITARY COUNSELOR JEREMIAH HOWARD FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  The sixth meeting of the National Energy Committee (NEC) was held on June 6 at the Ministry of Oil, where a discussion on issues currently impeding the flow of oil throughout the country took place. The primary subject discussed was costs associated with providing protection to strategic parts of the infrastructure.  Possible alternatives to current infrastructure security methods were also discussed and included adjusting battalion sizes, forming additional battalions and using technology to assist with area surveillance.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY COSTS:  Major General Heine, Acting Director of Iraqi Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO), attended the NEC at the Ministry of Oil to discuss what Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Chalabi referred to as "outrageous" infrastructure security costs.  DPM stated security costs 20 percent of allocated project budgets, and said he is considering the termination of outside security contracts.  He said Iraq cannot afford to continue spending so much on security and reminded attendees that Iraq has its own security forces, which should be able to provide the necessary protection of sites.  As an example, DPM said the country currently employs 22,000 security contractors at $1,000 per day, or $22 million daily. He pointed out that this is more than Kirkuk's daily oil proceeds.  DPM also stated $40 million of the $190 million Iraq received from the Unites States Agency for International Development goes to security.  DPM briefly touched on infrastructure hardening, stating that the original plan to dig tunnels for pipelines has been reduced to digging ditches designed to conceal strategic infrastructure areas.  DPM stated the goal is "just to move the oil" and feels these ditches are sufficient to accomplish the objective.  3. (C) THREATS AND INTIMIDATION:  Discussions regarding troops included the possible deployment of an additional 2 battalions to be trained by coalition forces - to the Al Fatah Bridge crossing.  (NOTE: Although a plan to train the oil security battalions has been discussed, no commitments have been made.) Iraqi Lieutenant General (LTG) Abdul Qadar, Commander of the Iraqi Field Army, said he has a group of trusted colonels who regularly survey the strategic infrastructure sites and report back to him on ways to improve security.  LTG Qadar said he would submit to DPM Chalabi an updated report that addresses the current and future needs of the battalions.  4. (C) PROTECTING STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE AREAS:  The discussion progressed to improving Al Fatah Bridge protection, which the committee believed could be accomplished by eliminating equipment shortages like night vision goggles. Committee members also discussed possibly adjusting battalion numbers, and improving command and control by bringing battalions under Ministry of Defense control so as to benefit from the support of both the Iraqi air force and navy. Other methods of protecting the strategic areas of infrastructure discussed included: increasing battalions from 17 to 20, adding barbed wire to strategic infrastructure areas, erecting additional observation points and installing motion-detecting radar systems.  The most aggressive idea was to install land mines around such areas, though most agreed this would be a dangerous measure.  5. (C) PENDING UPDATE FROM LTG Qadar:  LTG Qadar stated acts of sabotage took place near the pipelines after the most recent reconnaissance mission, and he hoped to give an update in a few days.  LTG Qadar also stated he would give an update on troops, as the new force members are locals and need to be trained.   6. (C) COMMENT:  Continuing discussions of oil infrastructure protection are important, but have produced no decisions yet.  The interim government gave responsibility for oil infrastructure protection to the Ministry of Defense in February, and the NEC meeting held May 23 confirmed this. However, this decision on responsibility also required the transfer of resources to accomplish the mission. A clear Iraqi government commitment needs to be made and appropriate resources allotted if Iraq's oil infrastructure is to be adequately protected and allow a freer flow of oil. It is not clear the DPM has the will or authority to deliver the resources. END COMMENT Jeffrey

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June. 12 were the preparations for drafting the constitution and the developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "National rights are red lines that should not be crossed" (Al-Ittihad, 6/12) B. "In order to root out terrorism" (Al-Bayyan, 6/12)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "National rights are red lines that should not be crossed" (Al-Ittihad, 6/12)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with the PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a third-page editorial by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about Kurdish rights:  "All parties should work to remove the anxiety that currently exists in the Iraqi political field. There are many factors that have contributed to this rise of anxiety that should be contained by simply instituting logical practices. One way to move forward is to hold meetings that are characterized by transparency. Iraq has many wise politicians and religious figures that are prepared to offer their assistance and advice. Today, unfortunately, a new trend has emerged in our society that is attempting to pass over the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) -- the document that all parties agreed to use as the foundation for the permanent constitution. Through the issuance of statements, this attempt is aimed at depriving the Kurds of their national and political rights.  It is strange that the majority of these statements have come from members of the Unified Iraqi Alliance (UIA). Perhaps the figures making such statements are unaware of the agreement that was reached between the UIA and the Kurdish list concerning the transitional government. These statements have taken many different forms, including the deletion of the three main words from the government swearing in ceremony and the Prime Minister not mentioning the Kurdish demands to the National Assembly with regard to the political program. In addition, statements on Kirkuk have appeared which contradict the previous agreement on this issue between the UIA and the Kurds and also oppose what is stated in the TAL. The Kurdish leadership has been clear on the Kirkuk issue and has demanded the necessity of implementing Article 58 from the TAL.  These statements indicate either a lack of understanding for the Kurdish political position or an ignorance of the history and facts of the Iraqi situation. Such unintelligent statements are only the fault of those who made them in the first place. However, there could also be an intentional campaign to prevent the Kurds from achieving their political and national demands, which will only lead to a national disaster. We hope that such statements are not being made intentionally and that they will not be repeated in the future, especially in an environment where everyone refuses to get caught up in sectarianism."   B. "In order to root out terrorism" (Al-Bayyan, 6/12)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with the Islamic Dawa Party led by Al-Jafari) published a front-page editorial about the developments of the "Lightning" military operation in Iraq:  "The terrible crime that occurred last Friday night in As- Shua'la was not the first of its kind. There have been many other similar crimes not only in this area but also in other areas throughout Iraq. The goal of these criminals - to create sectarian sedition that will ultimately spark a civil war -- has become clear to the Iraqi people. However, these criminals have begun to realize that their crimes will not achieve their objective and that it will be impossible for them to create a civil war that will fulfill the wishes of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi.  It is clear that the Lighting operation has had a successful impact, despite the continuance of attacks like that which recently occurred in As-Shua'la. Attacks such as this serve to indicate that the terrorists have reached their end in Iraq. Nonetheless, it is important for all Iraqi citizens to support the ongoing operations that are cleansing Iraq from the terrorists. Expressing condemnation is not enough. Everyone must make an active contribution in this important operation. The crime that occurred in As-Shua'la did not differentiate between any particular nationality or denomination. Instead, this crime was inflicted against all Iraqis and therefore demonstrates that no one is safe from being targeted by the terrorists as they continue the road of their demise. All Iraqis must contribute to this final stage of eradicating terrorism from our society. Serious and determined efforts are required by everyone so that we can end this terrible phenomenon in our society and return stability and security to Iraq."  JEFFREY

(C) President Talabani's Chief of Staff Kameran Karadaghi passed to Charge Staff Assistant the final text of a letter Talabani had dispatched to ITG Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafari, noting explicitly that the text had been drafted by Talabani and cleared by KDP chief Masoud Barzani.  In the brief meeting, Karadaghi echoed Talabani's frustrations of Jafari's "dictatorial" administrative style, and cited as an example Jafari's recent executive order ardning and releasing all Iranian detainees held by Iraq (see point seven in the letter's text below).  Elaborating, Karadaghi claimed that Jafari had taken advantage of Talabani's travel to Suleymania and Vice President Ghazi al-Yawar's European vacation to exclude the Presidency Council and curry favor with Iran after the recent trip of Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi.  Karadaghi concluded by noting that the PM's office rescinded the order only after three written communiques were dispatched from the President to the PM.  2. (C) Below is the full and final text of President Talabani's letter to Prime Minister Jafari, as referenced in REFTELs:  3. (C) BEGIN TEXT:  His Excellency the Prime Minister Dr. Ibrahim Jafari  With Greetings and Respect,  The Kurdish Alliance - an equal partner of the United Iraqi Alliance - has noticed with much regret that in forming the Government in accordance with the Protocol of Agreement between the two sides, you have strayed from some of the most important provisions of the agreement and violated some of the most important articles of the TAL. Your Excellency, it has been noticed that you are clearly acting unilaterally and avoiding the content and spirit of the agreement concluded between the Alliance and the Coalition as well as the TAL which should prevail until the completion of the permanent constitution.  While we are summarizing to your excellency our remarks, we look forward from now on to conformity with the facts in accordance with the law and the provisions of the Agreement for the sake of continued brotherhood and cooperation between us in order not to be forced to use our rights in accordance with Article (6) of the Protocol of Agreement because we can not keep silent and accept the imposed status quo which is contrary to the Law and the Agreement.  First: You have omitted from the oath performed by the ministers a very important and a principal provision, which is "its democratic and federalist system."  Second: Your speech did not mention federalism and Kurdistan, the great martyrs, and the crimes of Anfal committed against the people of Iraqi Kurdistan while it included language and detailed phrases about simple matters.  Third: Your long speech did not mention and condemn the policies of ethnic cleansing and the necessity of removing its impact as well as the implementation of Article 58 of the TAL.  Fourth: You have announced important appointments without referring in advance to the Cabinet and the Presidency of the Republic and even without consulting with them.  You have appointed Mr. Laith Kubba as spokesman for the Transitional Government without the agreement of the more important party in the Coalition and despite the fact that he (Mr. Kubba) is known for his chauvinistic and antagonistic position towards federalism as well as his provocative statements in America against the rights of the Kurdish people which were confirmed by the TAL, despite Mr. Kubba's antagonistic position towards the political parties of the Iraqi opposition and his promotion of deceiving concepts with the Americans, which caused them to commit the mistakes we are still suffering from.  Also, the appointment of a member of the Da'wa Party at the rank of a minister without the advance approval of the cabinet and the Presidency of the Republic (NOTE: This likely refers to CPA-era Health Minister and now Secretary General for the Council of Ministers Khider Abbas.  END NOTE).  Fifth: You have created nine ministerial committees totally connected to your excellency thus transforming the deputy prime ministers to ministers of state without work or functions despite your knowledge that Dr. Rowsch Nouri Shaways represents the second list in the National Assembly and the second nationality of the Iraqi people. This is considered an aggression on the rights of the representatives of the Kurdish people and the national consensus. Consequently, he can not be ignored and deprived from his authorities.  Sixth: You have limited, without legal justification and any rights, the authorities of Dr. Barham Ahmad Salih who is the Minister of Planning and International Development and confiscated half of his rights instead of adding other rights as agreed with the Coalition on the day of the formation of the Government.  The danger of this injustice lies in the exclusion of the Kurdish ministers from everything related to the economy and finance as well as their exclusion from everything related to the armed forces.  Seventh: You issue hasty decisions in violation of the laws; such as the pardon you gave to all Iranian prisoners without consulting with the ministers and the Presidency.  Dear Respected Brother,  We come now to your legal violations:  First: You are ignoring the fact that the Prime Ministry is part of the Government. Instead, you are acting as if you are the Government and you are limiting its authority to yourself alone, which is a clear violation of the provisions of Article 24 stipulating the following:  Dear Respected Brother,  We come now to your legal violations:  First: You are ignoring the fact that the Prime Ministry is part of the Government.  Instead, you are acting as if you are the Government and you are limiting its authority to yourself alone, which is a clear violation of the provisions of Article 24 stipulating the following:  Article 24:  (A) The Iraqi Transitional Government, which is also referred to in this Law as the federal government, shall consist of the National Assembly; the Presidency Council; the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister; and the judicial authority.  (B) The three authorities, legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be separate and  independent of one another.  (C) No official or employee of the Iraqi Transitional Government shall enjoy immunity for criminal acts committed while in office.  Article 25 stipulates the following:  The Iraqi Transitional Government shall have exclusive competence in the following matters:  (A) Formulating foreign policy and diplomatic representation; negotiating, signing, and ratifying international  treaties and agreements; formulating foreign economic and trade policy and sovereign debt policies;  (B) Formulating and executing national security policy, including creating and maintaining armed forces to secure, protect, and guarantee the security of the country's borders and to defend Iraq;  (C) Formulating fiscal policy, issuing currency, regulating customs, regulating commercial policy across regional and governorate boundaries in Iraq, drawing up the national budget of the State, formulating monetary policy, and establishing and administering a central bank;  (D) Regulating weights and measures and formulating a general policy on wages; (E) Managing the natural resources of Iraq, which belongs to all the people of all the regions and governorates of Iraq, in consultation with the governments of the regions and the administrations of the governorates, and distributing the revenues resulting from their sale through the national budget in an equitable manner proportional to the distribution of population throughout the country, and with due regard for areas that were unjustly deprived of these revenues by the previous regime, for dealing with their situations in a positive way, for their needs, and for the degree of development of the different areas of the country;  (F) Regulating Iraqi citizenship, immigration, and asylum; and  (G) Regulating telecommunications policy.  This way it becomes clear to all that the Government is composed of the Presidency Council, the Presidency of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, and that settling and prescribing the policies of the Government are among the duties and authorities of the three branches and not the Prime Minister alone. But we have noticed, with deep regret, that you are acting as if you alone are the Iraqi Government and are completely ignoring the Council of Ministers and the Presidency of the National Assembly.  The Government Statement  1- The Government statement prescribes the public policy of the Government. The three branches of the Government have the right to see, discuss and approve public policy before it is presented to the National Assembly. However you ignored all of this and did it alone. 2- The Government statement did not mention Article 58 of the TAL as well as the suffering of the Kurdish people as a result of the ethnic cleansing policy. 3- In preparing the Statement you violated the principle of agreement in accordance with paragraph (2) of Article (1) and paragraph (5), which necessitates political agreement before taking principal political, security, economic and administrative decisions. 4- The Government Statement did not mention: the full implementation of Article 58 of the TAL leading to the determination of administrative affiliations of disputed areas including the Governorate of Kirkuk, as stipulated in paragraph (1) of (Fourth). 5- The Government Statement ignored Article (3) of the Agreement between the Unified Coalition and the Kurdish Alliance.   Regarding Kirkuk  It appears from the Government Statement and your clear practical approval in your decisions regarding stopping payment of the funds required for the normalization of relations in Kirkuk that your excellency is practically taking an opposing view contrary, if not antagonistic, to the rights of the Kurdish people regarding Kirkuk. 1- Your Government Statement did not mention the necessity of the full implementation of Article 58 as stipulated in paragraph (1) of (Fourth). 2- Your Excellency's violation of the following text stated in paragraph (2) of the (Fourth): "The Transitional Government, within a period not exceeding one month, shall activate the normalization procedures including providing funds to finance the Commission for the Normalization of the Situation in Kirkuk and the Commission for Property Disputes."  (NOTE: Paragraph (3) has been taken out, when compared with the previous text. END NOTE)  Ignoring the issue of Kirkuk is in our view a very serious matter, and a clear violation of the agreement concluded between the Coalition and the Alliance and a clear violation of the TAL and the Alliance could not keep silent concerning this imposed status quo, let alone accepting it.  Your Excellency the Prime Minister,  In our concern for the historical relationship of struggle and the need to enforce the TAL and to abide by the agreement signed between the Kurdish Alliance and the United Iraqi Alliance, we ask you:  First: For organized coordination and cooperation between all parties of the Iraqi Government; i.e.: the Presidency Council, the Presidency of the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers and the establishment of a clear mechanism for accomplishing this so that the 3 branches of the government can assume their duties as outlined in Article 25.  Second: For continuous and daily coordination with their excellencies Dr. Rowsch Shaways and Dr. Barham Salih as representatives of the second party participating in the governmental coalition, with respect to political, economic and security issues and other issues as stated in the agreement and before taking important decisions unilaterally.  Third: To start the implementation of Article 58 of the TAL.  Fourth: To immediately activate the normalization procedures in Kirkuk Governorate, including providing the necessary funds for the functioning of the Normalization Commission and the Property Claims Commission.  Fifth: To issue orders to the Ministry of Finance to pay the grant given to the Kirkuk Governorate by the former Deputy Prime Minister.  Sixth: To concentrate in your speeches on democracy and federalism.  Seventh: To mention the tragedies, suffering, and martyrs of the Kurdish people and condemn the policy of ethnic cleansing and take legal measures to repeal the decisions of the Saddamist Revolutionary Command Council issued concerning this criminal policy.   With our deepest respect,  //Signed///  President Kurdish Alliance List Jalal Talabani 09 June 2005  END TEXT.  4. (C) COMMENT: Our earlier indications from DPM Rowsch Shaways that the text of this letter had been co-authored and cleared by SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakeem appear to be untrue based up the text itself and conversations with Talabani and SCIRI member Vice President Adel Mehdi.  Mehdi, however, has noted that both the Kurdish Alliance and SCIRI continue to lobby Jafari for the restoration of Barham Salih's responsibilities as ITG donor coordinator.  END COMMENT  5. (U) Minimize considered for REOs Basrah, Hillah, Kirkuk, and Mosul. Jeffrey 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002476  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, PTER, PREF, JO, IZ, UN SUBJECT: PROGRESS ON REMOTE MANAGEMENT OF IRAQ REFUGEE PROGRAMS  REF: A. BAGHDAD 01875      B. BAGHDAD 02123      C. BAGHDAD 01649  Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Henry S. Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C) Summary. Officers in charge of UNAMI, IOM, and UNHCR's Iraq refugee and IDP programs told visiting PRM PDAS Rich Greene May 17-18 in Amman that the UN is attempting to shift its focus from security to humanitarian related activities in Iraq, but that remote-control program management is likely to remain a necessity in 2005, despite the UN's recent return to Erbil and Basra.  Utilizing former UN employees to evaluate their local implementing partners, UNHCR and IOM believe that the MODM has established its credibility in Iraq in the last six months.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) PDAS Greene met with UNAMI rep John Pace May 17. Responding to Greene's questions on effectiveness of the UN's 'remote management' of operations in Iraq, Pace said UN presence is already increasing in Erbil and Basra branch offices, and international non- logistics staff will begin short-term visits soon. Accommodations, transportation, and security continue to constrain major progress in UN activities in Iraq as a whole. (Note: Additional personnel will focus on constitution development, rather than humanitarian work.  END NOTE.)  Pace explained that the UN in Iraq is working extensively through implementing partners, both international and national NGOs, to provide humanitarian assistance. Amman-based capacity building workshops support MoDM in its efforts to coordinate and participate more effectively in these programs.  3.  (C) Pace added that it's often a challenge to make a distinction between Iraq "humanitarian" and "reconstruction" activities.  He noted that the UN is developing a web site to provide hard information on its humanitarian and other field projects; for security reasons this will not disclose specific information on the UN's local implementing partners. Greene noted that housing construction initiatives would require reliable domestic partners, information that UN agencies have developed through their work in Iraq.  4.  (C) Greene pushed back on the UN's current staffing posture because of the security situation. He encouraged the UN to look hard at ways to meet its staffing requirements, while maintaining good security practices.  He added that the UN should do more to make others aware of the fairly extensive work it is carrying out in country.  Like it or not, the UN is "the canary in the coal mine" when it comes to signaling to other donors and NGOs the possibility of effectively carrying out humanitarian and related work in country.  5.  (C) May 18 PDAS Greene took part in a joint ProCare/IOM/UNHCR briefing on MODM capacity building. Attendees were: (USG) Rich Greene, PDAS PRM; Poloff, Notetaker; and (International Groups) Yacoub El Hillo, Chief of Mission UNHCR; James Lynch, Officer in Charge UNHCR Amman; Ghassan Shafiq Soufran, ProCare Managing Director; Ghada Shafiq Soufan, ProCare Managing Director; Rasha Abdel-Majeed, IOM Programme Officer Capacity Building; Michael Stanisich, IOM Programme Officer Capacity Building.  6.  (C) During this briefing, Greene met with ProCare's Ghada and Ghassan Shafiq Soufran, consultants for IOM and UNHCR's capacity building program with MoDM.  Representatives from ProCare focused on organizational improvements in MoDM in the last six months: developing the structure of the Ministry, drafting of basic laws, and human resource improvements.  Ghada Soufran said ProCare is still finalizing job descriptions for Ministry jobs and evluaing current employees.  She said Ministry employees did not until recently know their functions in detail, and this improvement is a direct result capacity building. Ghada added many of the 300 employees at the MoDM work in security.  The PDAS asked if downsizing MoDM was discussed, and the group said laid off employees could seek retribution against the Ministry.  Many stressed that the Ministry's enabling legislation is still awaiting approval. 7.  (C) Yacoub El Hillo stressed MoDM's positive role in Iraq.  He said the Ministry is now well known by both Iraqis and NGOs and is especially important to NGOs because of the security situation in Iraq.  MoDM visits refugees detained in prisons and follows up with other Iraqi Ministries.  Hillo said that internal and external recognition began with the November 2004 Fallujah campaign.  According to Hillo, MoDM had 10 staff members on the ground assisting returning families by supplying them with basic items.  NGOs now call on MoDM to respond to refugee crises because they can quickly react and are perceived as neutral, as opposed to being an outside invading force.  8.  (C) IOM Representative for Iraq Tschannen, who is based in Amman, stressed that IOM is ready to assist more returns in northern Iraq but noted that most European nations have agreed to continue refugees' continuing residence in those nations because of insecurity in Iraq.  The UK has 5,000 potential returnees, and IOM is waiting for the availability of charter flights to process the group.  Tschannen added that the Dutch had indicated they had about 12,000 potential returnees.  Sweden had also been in recent contact with IOM.  The Germans were handling their own return program without IOM assistance.  9.  (C) Concerning refugees in Iraq's neighboring countries, El Hillo noted that UNHCR had 30,000 registered in Jordan under its 1998 agreement (which requires UNHCR to secure third-country resettlement within 6 months). He added that about 3,000 new arrivals from Mosul had entered Syria this year. While el Hillo thought there was a real danger that setting criteria to determine which Iraqis would qualify for legal refugee status would cause more Iraqis to seek refuge in other countries than would otherwise be the case.  El Hillo noted that UNHCR decreased its budget for next year by $8 million because it was confident that most Iraqis can eventually return to Iraq.  10.  (C) On remote management, UNHCR argued the establishment of new, integrated UN centers in Basra and Erbil was a step forward but affirmed that they were using independent contractors who were former UN employees to evaluate its partners in Iraq.  UNHCR released a comprehensive review of all its programs in the north and had developed, in early May, its first evaluation report.  He said UNHCR's website includes an interactive map documenting its Iraq programs. While discrimination, lack of documentation, language barriers for Iraqis who had grown up in neighboring Iran, and unemployment remained key factors, El Hillo said the biggest problem with resettlement in the north was the skyrocketing cost of housing.  A house that used to cost $6,000 now costs $10,000.  El Hillo noted that UNHCR is carefully monitoring its partners and the effectiveness and sustainability of housing projects.  11.  (C) UNHCR's Jordan OIC stressed the need to press the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) to move forward with relocation of refugees currently in the Anbar desert camp of Al Tash to Sulaimaniya as soon as possible to stem the outflow of Al Tash residents towards Jordan; Lynch noted that additional arrivals could impact the GOJ agreement to consolidate the No Man's Land population in Ruwaishid (reftel). Although Jordan placed no explicit conditions on UNHCR, Lynch said that UNHCR had agreed to look "vigorously" for third-country solutions to ensure the remaining ex-Iraqi caseload. (Note:  Iraq's PM has approved closing al Tash camp and transferring the refugees to Sulaimaniya.)  12.  (C) COMMENT:  PDAS Greene's visit encouraged UNHCR and IOM to take more direct action on the ground in Iraq.  Post welcomes this effort to increase UN presence in Iraq and effective humanitarian action. END COMMENT  13.  (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK minimize considered.   Jeffrey 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002479  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/2015 TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab, National Assembly SUBJECT: UPDATE ON OUTREACH TO IRAQIS ON CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION STANDUP  Classified By: Classified by Charge d'Affaires James Jeffrey for reason  s 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Summary:  Some Sunnis are digging in to get 25 additional Sunni representatives on the Constitution Committee, although when pressed senior leaders will drop to 20 fairly quickly, including Talabani and Committee Deputy Chair Janabi.  Shi'a contacts universally support 15 as a maximum; Barzani appears to be in the Shi'a camp.  Next steps: Much of the action will shift to Irbil, where many political figures will attend Barzani's swearing in as KRG President on June 14.  The DCM will be present. Charge will continue to press the need to close the deal with additional contacts June 13. As the parliamentary factions have seemingly agreed to the conditions for Sunni inclusion, the only issue is numbers, where the Sunnis maybe trying to create demographic facts, or are raising a demand they know (and some hope) will be rejected, potentially raising UN (and even US) ire toward the Shia-dominated National Assembly.  Sunni Waqf Director -------------------  2.  (C) Sunni Waqf Director Adnan al-Dulaymi backed down "personally" on his demand for 25 Sunni Arab additions to the Constitution Committee in June 11 meeting with the Charge, but he would not go lower than 20.  He said that Sunni Arabs would call for U.N. arbitration if pressured to take accept 15.  He said Sunnis would also consider boycotting the process altogether.  Dulaymi passed Charge a list of 25 candidates for the committee that appeared to have been written in concert with the Iraqi Islamic Party, but excluded the National Dialogue Council.  Dulaymi has prepared a separate list of some 53 individuals he recommended be consulted as experts and advisors but not brought on as voting members.  Charge stated that our soundings had indicated that 15 additional Sunnis was as far as the parliament was likely to go; Delaymi lamely argued that the Sunni percent of the population (he claimed 30-40 percent, most objective figures range around 20 percent) and the 42 percent of 'no votes' (sic) in the election required a large Sunni group to represent the unrepresented.  Charge urged Dulaymi to rethink his position on numbers and take advantage of the opportunity to participate as equals in this process. Charge stressed that US would go to bat for equal status for new Sunnis, and the right for Sunnis to pick their own candidates, but we would not press for more than 15 Sunni representatives.  TNA Speaker Hassani -------------------  3.  (C) TNA Speaker Hachim al-Hasani agreed with Charge that 15 additional Sunni Arabs was a reasonable number in a June 11 meeting.  Hassani said he would meet with Dulaimi privately later that day to convince him to accept that number.  VP Abd al Mahdi ---------------  4.  (C) Abd al Mahdi was supportive of the Charge,s presentation.  He said as well that 15 additional Sunnis was all the traffic was likely to bear.  He said he would back Sunni requests for equal status (the 'consensus' rule for decisions) and the right for the Sunnis to pick their own representatives.  He however pushed for a Sunni contact now in Washington, Tahar Jabr Alwani, whom he said is well known to US officials, to be given one of the Sunni slots.  Charge made no commitment.  President Talabani ------------------  5.  (C)  In response to the Charge,s presentation, Talabani said that he had pushed for 25 Sunnis, because he wanted representatives from four different groups including 'liberals,' members of the communist party, and others (whom one could describe as 'anti-clerical' Sunnis. ( Clearly Talabani wants to water down the nationalist/clerical color of most of the Sunni interlocutors.)  When Charge asked if Talabani could deliver the parliament on 25, he backed down immediately.  He admitted that even Barzani (who is particularly miffed at the Sunnis right now, according to Talabani) would not go that far, let alone the Shi'a.  He then put forward the possibility of '20' additional Sunni slots. Charge said that 15 appeared to us both as reasonable and as the most that the traffic would bear.  Talabani said he would try to work all this in Irbil at the KRG swearing-in, now scheduled for June 14. National Dialogue Council -------------------------  6.  (C) On June 11, Mahmoud Mashadani did most of the talking with A/Polcouns.  He said 25 was the minimum number to represent the Sunni demographic, which was defined by the percentage of non-voters.   Fifteen would not be accepted by the Sunni community and would expose anybody who agreed to to great pressure to withdraw from the political process and physical danger.  He then added that if Waqf head Dulaymi would publicly agree to 15, this would increase that number,s acceptability, even though Dulaymi, as a government official, was not seen as completely representative if the Sunni community.  NDC Salafist representative Abd al Nasir al Janabi claimed that former UN rep to Iraq Jamal Benomar had been in recent contact with him and other members of the Council and had told them that even the Secretary of State had recognized their importance in the community.  PM Jafari ---------  7.  (C) Jafri's top political staffer told us June 11  that Jafari strongly believed 15 was the maximum, and urged that we press our contacts on that number.  The PM,s office has also confirmed that the Council of Ministers has decided to remove Dulaymi as head of the Sunni Waqf, as well as the head of the Shia Waqf.  Although the putative replacement for Dulaymi may have broad support in the Sunni community, we have urged the PM,s office and the Presidency to go slow on making these changes at this delicate political moment.

Jeffrey, Charge d'Affaires, for r  easons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Summary. Charge and DCM emphasized the importance of meeting the August 15 constitution drafting deadline in a June 12 meeting with UNAMI,s SRSG Qazi.  Qazi affirmed UNAMI,s support to helping Iraq successfully reach the drafting deadline and provided an overview of their efforts and challenges to date.  Charge explained that US policy was to actively engage Iraqi decision makers to ensure the issue of Sunni inclusion was resolved without further delay. UN's Haysom confirmed from his work with the Parliament that it is not disposed to grant the Sunni Arabs more than 15 additional seats in the commission. UNAMI is providing the TNA,s Constitution Committee with expert technical advice. Finally, UNAMI sees federalism, distribution of natural resources and form of governance as the key issues for the constitutional debate. End Summary.  ---------------------------------------- August 15 Constitution Drafting Deadline ----------------------------------------  2.  (C) In a June 12 meeting with SRSG Qazi, Charge and DCM emphasized the paramount importance of helping Iraq meet the August 15 constitution drafting deadline.  UNAMI and the international community must do everything possible to ensure Iraq successfully completes its constitution in a timely manner stated Charge to protect the unique result Iraq achieved on January 30 at great sacrifice to many people.  If Iraq fails to meet the August 15 deadline, said Charge, the insurgency will be emboldened at the expense of security throughout Iraq.  3.  (C) Qazi acknowledged Charg,s oints stating that not a single Iraqi had spoken to UNAMI of delaying the August 15 deadline.  While there is a need to ensure the transparency and ownership of the development process by all Iraqis said Qazi, the UN is firmly committed to the August drafting deadline.  UNAMI Constitution Support Team Head Fink Haysom added that he fully expects the TNA,s Constitution Committee to press on to August 15 without delay and, should the constitution not be exactly completed by that date, the TNA will most likely finish the constitution after August 15 without invoking the TAL,s provisions calling for the dissolution of the ITG.  --------------------------------------------- -------- Internal Sunni Power Struggle Drives Inclusion Debate --------------------------------------------- --------  4.  (C) Charge explained that all Iraqis involved in Sunni inclusion negotiations now recognize the miscalculation made by establishing a 55-member Constitution Committee with only two Sunnis and, as a consequence, agree on the need to add additional Sunnis; the only question is how many and who. USG policy is to engage Iraqi decision makers at the highest levels of our government to encourage them to add 15 additional Sunni members selected by Sunnis, to the Constitution Committee stated Charge.  5.  (C) Qazi agreed that time is of the essence in adding Sunnis to the committee and that the Sunnis themselves should recognize that the exact number of additional Sunnis within the Committee is not critical in view of committee,s consensus decision-making methodology.  Charge concurred adding that all sides in the debate must negotiate from the n 15.  6.  (C) Qazi, Charge and DCM agreed that the current debate spoke more about internal Sunni power plays than any inter-sectarian matter.  This debate, said Qazi is driven by Sunnis who are connecting their participation on the constitution committee with their future electoral opportunities.  They are arguing for more positions on the committee because they cannot settle their own internal leadership squabbles.  DCM agreed stating that the real debate was within the Sunni community over control, a debate that is intractable at present, but must be ended.  ------------------------------------ UNAMI Struggles to Recruit Personnel ------------------------------------  7.  (C) SRSG Qazi complained to Charge and DCM that while UNAMI was successfully identifying talented professionals to serve on their constitution and elections teams, the convoluted nature of the UN,s compensation system was creating havoc.  UN personnel must forgo 45 percent of their salary when they accept a position in Baghdad, claimed Qazi. For example, Carlos Valenzuela,s secretary, who was assigned to the UN,s Amman office, made more than Carlos did while he was in Baghdad.  We hope UN Headquarters remedies this matter quickly said Qazi, or we will have great difficultly meeting our mandate.  ---------------------------------- Constitution Issues and Assistance ----------------------------------  8.  (C) Constitution Team Leader Haysom offered that UNAMI and international assistance to the Constitution Committee was proceeding quite well.  While Chairman Hammoudi had initially been reluctant to embrace expert technical assistance, he had changed his attitude after a recent engagement where experts provided detailed advice on how to reach the August 15 deadline.  Many members including Hammoudi were initially disinclined to embrace experts because they associated their views with western values that would be slanted toward a secular constitution.  That perception appears to have been successfully surmounted, stated Haysom  9.  (C) Addressing constitutional issues, Haysom opined that federalism and the division of natural resources would be the most vexing issues for Iraqis to resolve.  Additionally, the form of governance will also be key to the successful incorporation of Kurdistan.  Haysom said Iraqis would likely settle on a parliamentary system, although they seem enthralled by the idea of directly electing a President.  ------------------------------------------ Irbil Middle Ring and IZ Security Concerns ------------------------------------------  10.  (C) Qazi voiced his concern with impending changes to International Zone (IZ) security responsibilities and asked that UNAMI be kept informed of any upcoming changes so they could take appropriate action.  DCM indicated there was no hard timelines for such changes, but that the International Zone would slowly but steadily change from green to amber to red over the next two years as the New Embassy Compound was completed and IZ security was turned over to Iraqi security forces.  Qazi also mentioned that middle ring security in Irbil was still not functional as the Koreans were unwilling to provide escorts for UNAMI movements other than for VIPs.  11.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June. 13 were constitution-drafting preparations and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "The New Iraq" (Al-Sabah, 6/13) B. "Good and Bad" (Az-Zaman, 6/13)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "The New Iraq" (Al-Sabah, 6/13)  Al-Sabah (Iraqi Media Network, non-biased) published a front-page editorial by Mohammed Abdul-Jabbar about the institutions in the new Iraq:  "We need to develop new theories and descriptions for every field of life in our new Iraq after the Iraqi people witnessed the last half century living under illegal governments and a dictatorial regime. The real meaning of "the new Iraq" depends on the success of the political and intellectual elites in developing new perceptions and their ability to implement these perceptions into new practices, traditions, and strong institutions that are active in society. This new strategy can be applied in fields of politics, economics, social relations, and the media. There are many examples of these new perceptions and institutions in the new Iraq.  One such example can be derived from the position of the armed forces in the political arena. In the new Iraq, the armed forces must report to a civilian authority. Therefore, the Minister of Defense should be a civilian with knowledge of the military. Indeed, under such a scenario, both the Army and other armed forces would fall under the authority of the civilian political leadership. In the past, when we lived under the control of a military or quasi-military government, the armed forces were always given the first and final word in all societal issues. This scenario existed even under the authority of the Baath party, which was supposed to be ruled by a civilian leadership. Although the leader of the regime was a civilian, he nonetheless often wore a military uniform and placed the highest military rank on his own shoulders.  Another area of interest in the new Iraq is the media. In the former Iraq, the Iraqi people grew accustomed to the official media, which was also known as the government's media. This official media became the lone source of news for the dictatorship. Under this scenario, the media was simply a form of propaganda that served and worshipped the ruler of the state. However, in the new, federal, constitutional, and democratic Iraq, the government will not be able to penetrate the media. Liberating the media, the financial market, and civil society from governmental authority is a basic condition for establishing democracy."  B. "Good and Bad" (Az-Zaman, 6/13)  Az-Zaman (independent, lately anti-coalition) published on last page editorial by Fatih Abdul Salam about the Baath party:  "In spite of all the criticism that is being directed at Damascus, President Bashar Al-Assad seems that he has decided to go on indefinitely boasting the political name of the Baath by describing it as a movement for leading both the society and state, as stated under Article 8 of the Syrian constitution. Between Iraq and Syria, there exists only a superficial borderline. Therefore, the Baath Party conference that was held in Damascus sent a clear message against the Debaathification process in Iraq.  The Baath party that has been uprooted from power in Iraq is very similar to the Syrian Baath party that continues to rule that country. The Syrian Baath party has restricted all aspects of life according to what Damascus views as suitable to its own political situation and strategy. However, during the Baath Party's recent conference, the Party exhibited a challenging tone to Washington as it discussed for the first time in many years cases that were previously forbidden to discuss. For example, the Party granted citizenship to 200,000 Kurds, established a law for alternative political parties, and lightened the security restrictions throughout society.  The Baath party of Syria is also considered as an ally to Tehran, which currently faces serious challenges from Washington. Indeed, it appears that the regimes in Damascus and Tehran are both caught in a standoff with Washington. Damascus has insinuated in its latest Baath conference and Tehran with its presidential elections that they are challenging Washington by making steps of undetermined reforms. But what should concern the Iraqi people is that they will likely face a future crisis with the Syrian regime because of the difference in ideology of the two countries' regimes -- regardless of whether Damascus is an ally of Tehran. We must not forget that the Baath party originated in Syria and it is possible that it will continue to flow into Iraq via the Euphrates and Tigris rivers."  JEFFREY

Ensher for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Summary.  Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) officials told Poloff June 12 they had decided that voter registration would be held throughout all of Iraq beginning August 1, and last four weeks.  During this period, persons who did not appear in voter lists on January 30 polling day and persons who turned 18 after December 31, 2004 will have the opportunity to register at Voter Registration Centers.  Since the target audience will not receive initial prodding from the Food Distribution System, IECI is planning for a vigorous, widespread public information campaign.  A general timeline on voter registration is in paragraph 5. End Summary.  2.  (C) IECI Board of Commissioners decided June 11 that voter registration would be held throughout all of Iraq beginning August 1, lasting for a period of four weeks.  Voter registration will be conducted primarily through the approximately 550 IECI District Electoral Offices (DEO) that will serve as Voter Registration Centers (VRC).  Unlike voter registration in 2004 that preceded the January 30, 2005 elections, there will be no pre-printed forms distributed to potential voters through the Food Ration Centers.  Information relating to new registrants and changes to existing records (i.e. change of address, deaths) will be captured on a single blank form available at the Voter Registration Centers.  3.  (C) The target audience for the 2005 voter registration program is primarily those people presently not on the voter roll.  Specifically, voter registration will target: those persons who did not find their name on the voting lists at polling centers on January 30 polling day; persons who failed to register during 2004; and persons who have since December 31, 2004, reached 18 years of age.  The target audience will also include voters who participated in the January 30 election through the exceptional provision of same day registration -- as in Kirkuk where it is known that as many as 100,000 persons registered on polling day.  4.  (C) IECI plans to conduct a vigorous public information campaign on voter registration that will commence no later than two weeks before the start of voter registration, and end two weeks after the conclusion of voter registration.  Since voters will not receive initial prodding from the Food Distribution System, the public information campaign will be widespread and ubiquitous, and regionally specific.  Special attention and resources will be placed on areas known to be politically sensitive, like Kirkuk.  5.  (C) General timeline for the voter registration program:  JUNE Week 1-2  Drafting and Approval of Registration Regulations Week 1-3  Drafting and Approval of Security Plan  JULY Week 1-2  Training of DEOs Week 3-4  Training of GEOs Week 1-4  Delivery of Registration Materials to VRCs Week 3  Start Public Information Campaign  AUGUST Week 1-4  VOTER REGISTRATION  SEPTEMBER Week 1  EXHIBITION AND CHALLENGES Week 2  End Public Information Campaign  6.

(C) SUMMARY.  Minister of State for Women's Affairs Azhar Sheikhly told PolOff on June 9 that the Council of Ministers denied her request to elevate the status of the Women's Ministry (reftel).  Transitional National Assembly member (TNA) Faiezah Baba Khan will now raise the issue for TNA consideration.  State ministries are now required to get permission from the Council of Ministers to conduct business with the major ministries, further limiting their effectiveness.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) Minister of State for Women's Affairs Azhar Sheikhly told PolOff on June 9 that the Council of Ministers' legal advisor denied her request to elevate the status of the Women's Ministry (reftel). According to Sheikhly, the advisor told her that he failed even to see the need for such a ministry so could not support her request.  Sheikhly said she submitted to the Council a letter of protest stating the denial was based on the personal bias of the advisor and, therefore, not legal.  3.  (C) Sheikhly told PolOff that Transitional National Assembly (TNA) member Faiezah Baba Khan (PUK) agreed to raise to the TNA the need for the Women's Ministry to be an independent organization.  Sheikhly was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of success, but emphasized the difficulties the Ministry currently faces on every level in the absence of a budget and autonomy.  According to Sheikhly, the Ministry is allotted 43 employees -- to include 25 guards -- but does not contract with them directly. The Council of Ministers determines employees' salaries and enters into contracts with them. Sheikhly complained that she is trying to hire an advisor, but the salary offered by the Council of Ministers is too paltry to attract qualified candidates.  4.  (C) Minister Sheikhly further stated that her operational effectiveness is limited by new constraints placed on her by the Council of Ministers. Although she previously was allowed to contact other ministers directly, she is now forbidden to do so without specific permission by the Council of Ministers.  (NOTE:  The Minister of State for Civil Affairs, Ala'a Habib Khadim, told PolOff on June 12 that state ministries are required to request Council of Ministry permission in order to conduct business with the major ministries.  Khadim added that the Council of Ministries regards state ministries as no more than government consultants, suggesting that such ministries should be eliminated.  END NOTE.)  ------- COMMENT -------  5.  (C) The necessity of the Women's Ministry and its lack of independence has been debated since its inception.  However, during the constitutional drafting process -- particularly given the likely debate over the rights of women -- the Women's Ministry could play a role in facilitating the dialogue amongst the Constitutional Committee, the Government, non-governmental organizations, and the general public.

Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: June 13 was another day of negotiations on Sunni Arab inclusion on the Constitution Committee. Negotiators modified their positions, but did not resolve their disagreements.  Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Adnan al-Janabi told the Charge that he felt "plus 15" (i.e., total of 17 Sunni Arabs) was a reasonable number of additions but complained that irresponsible statements from President Talabani and the Sunni Waqf had driven the number up.  He requested that Talabani retract his support for 25. We spoke to Talabni's chief of staff who pointed to his statement to the media on June 12 as having clarified that Talabani was not committed to any particular number.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) leader Muhsin Abd al-Hamid reduced his demand to 20 representatives in a separate June 13 meeting with Charge.  He said that he feared that going any lower would open his party to charges that the IIP was selling out Sunni Arab interests.  Abd al Hamid agreed to discuss the issue with his colleagues.  Charge emphasized, and Hamid agreed, that a quick resolution of the issue would speed the path to Iraq's next elections.  End Summary.  ----------------------------- JANABI SAYS HE'S "DEADLOCKED" -----------------------------  3. (C) Adnan al-Janabi said that felt "deadlocked" between hardline stances by the Shia leadership and his own Sunni Arab colleagues.  Shia leaders who publicly called for adding only 11 Sunni Arabs to the committee provoked Sunni Arabs for no reason he said.  That led leaders like Adnan Dulaymi to announce an unrealistic goal of some 25 additional members, he said.  Meanwhile, President Talabani's public statement June 8 indicating support for 25 additional Sunni Arabs only hardened their position.  Janabi warned that continued delays on the issue had brought the matter near a "crisis" point and Sunni Arab leaders were considering publicizing their grievances and withdrawing from the process.  4. (C) Janabi said he considered 15 additional Sunni Arabs to be a reasonable number but would need help pressuring the Sunni Waqf and Iraqi Islamic Party.  He also asked the USG to weigh in with Talabani and ask him to retract or moderate his support for 25 additional Sunni Arabs, a stance that was complicating negotiations.  He claimed that he saw the possibility that Talibani would push all sides to add 16 Sunni Arabs, for 18 total.  In any event, Janabi urged the USG to consider statements that would help Sunni Arabs agree "without losing face."  He specifically mentioned the idea of emphasizing the principle of consensus and allowing additional Sunni Arabs join the process as non-voting consultants and experts.  ------------------------------------- TALABANI WITHDRAWS HIS SUPPORT FOR 25 -------------------------------------  5. (C) After the Janabi meeting, we contacted Presidential Chief of Staff Kameran Qaradaghi who pointed out that his June 12 public statement had distanced the president from the demand for 25.  Qaradaghi said that Talibani's previous statement was "misunderstood."  He added that Talibani was most concerned that all members of the Committee be equal and was not in a position to set numbers.  ------------------------------- IRAQI ISLAMIC PARTY DROPS TO 20 -------------------------------  6. (C) Iraqi Islamic Party leader Muhsin Abd al-Hamid stuck hard to 25 representatives in a separate June 13 meeting with Charge but had dropped to 20 by the end of the meeting.  IIP Secretary General Tariq al Hashemi acknowledged that Talabani  SIPDIS had changed his position.  Abd al Hamid claimed that if he went any lower, competing Sunni groups would attack him for selling out their community's rights.  He claimed that even the call for 25 representatives was less than the Sunni Arabs deserved.  He made the familiar specious argument that the 42 percent of Iraqis who did not vote in January were all Sunni Arabs, meaning that their community should have representation of that proportion on the Constitution Committee.  7. (C) Abd al Hamid said that he strongly supported meeting the August 15 deadline and believed that new elections were the surest path to improving Sunni Arab participation in politics.  He warned that Shia politicians would try to miss the deadline so as to extend their own time in power.  Hamid said his party had only nominated legal experts to the Constitutional Committee, consenting to add one political representative, Ayad al-Samarai, only at the insistence of the Shia leadership.  8. (C) COMMENT: We now have heavy Sunni hitters like TNA Speaker Hasani and Janabi both pushing for an additional 15 Sunni Arabs, and the gap between them and the Iraqi Islamic Party crowd has narrowed to five.  All parties are discussing this relentlessly and we will keep communications ongoing. What is behind all of this of course are decades of misunderstanding and distrust, horrific Ba'athist rule, and a perceived need by all parties to score points in a particularly rigid zero sum game.  Thus even when we resolve the numbers dispute, the names themselves may be another issue.  We will continue to urge The Iraqi Islamic Party and National Dialogue Council to improve their communications to resolve the numbers argument.   We anticipate further developments over the next two days as the TNA convenes and the Constitution Committee meets.  END COMMENT  9.

Ensher.  Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Leading Islamic cleric and founding Da'wa party member Muhammad Bahr al-Ulum told Poloff the US was "deserting the Shia" and attempting to bring Ba'thists back to power--comments we have heard recently from other Shia interlocutors.  Al-Ulum was especially incensed over an article in a leading Iraqi newspaper claiming how the US is working with the UN to secure an agreement with the resistance and return Ba'thists.  We will seek to correct this perception. Al-Ulum also detailed the Islamic parties' evolution from denouncement to acceptance of democracy because they came to see democracy as a route to power.  Al- Ulum made a distinction between Islamist "acceptance" of democracy versus their "belief" in and true understanding/respect for the system and concepts. Bahr al-Ulum has written extensively on the subject and is regarded as a leading Iraqi "liberal Islamist". END SUMMARY.  2.  (C/NF) Former Governing Council member, founding Da'wa party member, and leading Islamic cleric/writer Muhammad Bahr al-Ulum met with PolOff on June 12 at his residence.  Bahr al-Ulum expressed grave concerns about the Transitional National Assembly's ability to forge a constitution that satisfies all Iraqi factions, especially given the excessive demands from Kurds and Sunnis, he said.  Sunnis were emboldened by clause 61c in the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) that allows three provinces to veto the constitution, if each votes to do so by two-thirds.  3.  (C/NF) Al-Ulum said the Kurds are trying to impose their ethnicity on the rest of the country by pressing for the Kurdish language to be one of Iraq's official languages, as it is in the TAL.  Kurdish should only be official in the North.  --------------------------------------------- Bahr al-Ulum Believes USG Intent on Returning Ba'thists ---------------------------------------------  4.  (C/NF) Bahr al-Ulum became visibly agitated as he brought up the topic of Sunni/Ba'thist participation in the constitution and what he said was US support to bring them back to power.  Bahr al-Ulum angrily pointed to the headline article of that day's Azzaman newspaper:  "Brahimi and US Embassy Have Secret Plan to Restore Ba'thists."  Al-Ulum criticized the US position towards Shia--"the children of mass graves"-- who had suffered so much during the former regime and had been killed by Sunni extremists since the fall of the regime and yet have only shown restraint.  Al-Ulum accused the US of imposing the 25 names submitted to the constitutional committee, 10-15 of whom, he said, were high-level Ba'thists including the former Minister of Justice Munthir al-Shawy and former Office Manager for Saddam Hussayn Akram al-Witri.  Al-Ulum warned that the US policy is driving the Shia further and further into the hands of Iran, which is not good for the US or Iraq.  5.  (C/NF) PolOff pushed back, noting that the US has suggested no names to the constitutional committee and has stated that 25 Sunni additions to the Constitutional Committee would be unacceptable to other communities.  PolOff added that US policy is aimed at providing non-violent access to the political process for all Iraqi communities.  Bahr al-Ulum and his aides urged that the USG do more to publicize this position.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Bahr al-Ulum Discusses Islamic Parties' Concept of Democracy --------------------------------------------- -----  6.  (C/NF) A leading Shia Islamic thinker and proponent of liberal Islamism, as well as one of the founding members of the Da'wa party, Bahr al-Ulum detailed to PolOff his view of Islamist parties' evolution from denouncement to acceptance of democracy.  --DEMOCRACY AND ISLAM COMPATIBLE.  Iraqi Shia Islamic parties, including Da'wa, at first rejected democracy because they lacked a clear understanding of the term. Democracy was viewed as a foreign, Western, even heathen, concept--created by the "Godless Greeks" as a system of people self-government in contrast to a divine government.  During the turbulent years of upheaval in Iraqi politics and the decline of the clerical class in the early 1960s, Bahr al-Ulum and his colleagues studied various governing systems to redress the exclusion and suffering Shia were experiencing.  Through his study of democracy, he noted the similarity of democratic and Islamic concepts, such as shura (consultation) and rule of law.  --MEANS FOR SHIA TO GAIN POWER.  Just as important as the compatibility of Islam and democracy, al-Ulum saw democracy as a means for Shia to gain power through the majority.  During the 1970's in Iraq, many Da'wa factions and other Islamic parties started opening up their thought to democratic principles in part because of this realization.  --"MEANING OF DEMOCRACY" ANECDOTES.  AL-Ulum used examples to explain his view of democracy.  "I do not believe it is right to dance, but if we are out at a gathering, you can dance and I will not.  Each one can express what he believes is right."  Al-Ulum also told a story of one of the Shia's most revered figures, Imam Ali, that illustrates there is a similar concept in Islam to the democratic view that all are equal before the law.  --"ACCEPTANCE VERSUS BELIEF" IN DEMOCRACY.  Bahr al- Ulum was careful to distinguish between the Islamic parties' "acceptance" of democracy as a means to ascend to power versus a system in which they truly believe.  Al-Ulum acknowledged that he himself does not know if the parties truly understand the concepts or believe in them.  However, al-Ulum opined that the Islamist parties would increasingly take ownership of and imbibe democratic principles through their ever- increasing exposure of it.  Al-Ulum said the parties have had a taste of democracy and proclaim they support it and would be viewed by the people as "two- faced" if they backtracked from this position.  Al- Ulum, however, noted that there are still widely diverging opinions on democracy within the Da'wa party itself and even more so within other Islamic parties.  7.  (C/NF) Comment:  Muhammad Bahr al-Ulum's accusation that the US is turning away from the Shia and seeking to impose Ba'thists, although delivered in a more agitated manner than our other Shia interlocutors, echoes the consternation we hear from them over the unfounded allegations that Sunni outreach really means a Ba'ath restoration.  As we continue efforts to achieve acceptable representation for all communities, we will have to continue to clarify and explain our views to prevent this type of misunderstanding that draws from the history of repression experienced by Iraqi Shia.  Bahr al-Ulum's insights on the evolution of Islamic parties' views on democracy and the remaining ambivalence towards the term--other than an expedient way to gain power--helps explain the contradictory writings of the Da'wa and other Islamists' views on democracy.  8.  (C/NF) Bio Notes:  Bahr al-Ulum left the Da'wa party in 1960 because he said he preferred to be a religious rather than political leader.  Al-Ulum said he was very close to Grand Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim during his time in Iraq.  Al-Ulum lent support from 1960-1969 to political movements that opposed the Ba'th party even though he himself was no longer a member of any party.  Al-Ulum claimed he worked with all parties except the communists and Ba'thists because he refused to work with parties with Iraqi blood on their hands.  In 1969, the Ba'th regime sentenced him to death and he fled the country, first hiding out in Egypt, Kuwait, and Iran before he finally settled in London in 1970.  He lived in London until the fall of the regime, during which time al- Ulum frequently lectured at London universities on Islam and democracy.  Bahr al-Ulum began writing his Islamic political treatises in 1961.  Al-Ulum recounted that while he traveled frequently to Iran during his time in London for work in the opposition, he is the least pro-Iran of the Islamic leaders.  He was called the "American" Bahr al-Ulum because of his defense of liberal democratic ideals.  9.  (U) REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.   Jeffrey

END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. " Who Guarantees? " (Al-Sabah, 6/14) B. " The Shadows will disappear " (Azzaman, 6/14)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. " Who Guarantees? " (Al-Sabah, 6/14)  Al-Sabah (IMN) published a front-page editorial by Mohammed Abdul-Jabbar about the institutions of the new Iraq:   " The government started a campaign against corruption in addition to its campaign against terrorism. Together these issues represent the greatest dangers facing the political process and reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  Corruption has affected government structures, and although it was inherited from the former Ba'ath regime, the cruel fact is that corruption has increased. So it has been necessary to investigate corruption since April 9,2003 for the sake of cleansing Iraq's administrative system.  In order to enhance the fortunes of all and to encourage citizens to walk on the path of honesty, even the highest levels of government must be investigated.  For that reason the Commission on Public Integrity was founded, but who will guarantee that those who fight corruption will not deviate?  Who will guarantee that the new ministers and leaders will not be attracted by money and power and not misuse them?  It is not a matter of personal intentions and political slogans. The truth is that without some procedures and regulations from strong institutions capable of controlling, monitoring, and calling the corrupt to account, there are no guarantees for any official.  Some of these procedures are:  -The officials should reveal their personal and family fortunes before getting an official post; and their incomes should be periodically reviewed. -Government contracts should obey the principle of transparency and be publicly published by the media. -Enhance and develop the Commission on Public Integrity's role and maintain its independence. -Enhance media freedom in order to monitor the government and reveal corruption to the citizens."     B. "The Shadows will disappear" (Azzaman, 6/14)  Azzaman (independent) published a last page editorial by Fatih Abdulsalam about politicians:   "These days in Iraq there are political and personal shadows.  Which means there are people here who are controlled by forces other than themselves.  These forces are the Americans.  Since the people believe that the Americans control the government they will believe that the government will do illegal things and that the ministers in this government will also do illegal things. Behind every Iraqi soldier or policeman there is the shadow of a US or MNF-I battalion.  While there are some politicians who were in the shadows not cooperating with the occupation and suddenly they decided that the occupation was all right after all. These politicians have emerged from the shadows.  There are two kinds of shadows.  One is transparent while the other is dark.  Everyone can see what the transparent shadow is doing.  He can be stealing or hitting someone and we can see his movements, even if he is hiding in that shadow.  The other shadow is doing its business behind closed doors.  So we cannot see it and we don't know what it is doing.  The Iraqi people have known about these shadows for a long time.  They understand that shadows cannot be trusted. The logic of life, history, and science says that all shadows will eventually disappear.  No single shadow can last forever because the earth moves and the shadows change. People also change.  Their lives change and because of this they will change their position on issues over time.  If even the people who rely on reality have been changed, what will happen to those who rely on shadows?  With no doubt they will fill their hands with the wind."  JEFFREY

Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Charge had a long one-on-one exchange with UNAMI SRSG, Ambassador Ashraf Qazi, on June 14.  The main subject was aspects of Sunni outreach, both the immediate problem and the longer-term aspects of the Sunni insurgency.  Charge explained our position on the Constitutional Commission in considerable detail, urging Qazi to support, including the total of 17 Sunni Arab members in an expanded Commission. Qazi played his cards close to his chest, but indicated he would meet later today with Sunni leaders and suggested that he would try to be helpful.  He did not challenge the premises of our position.  2. (C) Qazi did go on at length about the difficulties dealing with the Sunnis here, and their failure to recognize that they are facing a fundamentally changed Iraq.  He appears to think highly of many of the Shia political leaders, and compares the Sunnis with the Muslim population of South Asia, which simply could not grasp that they were no longer the ruling class--until the denouement of the Pakistan-India split.  Still, he lamented that no Shia leader, including the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has won the mantle of "spokesperson for the entire population," a problem that haunted Gandhi as well.  3. (C) Obviously fishing for concessions for the Sunnis, Qazi asked about MNF-I accepting a "timeline" for withdrawal. Charge explained in detail why this was tantamount to declaring us an illegal occupation, would lose the point that Coalition forces are in Iraq for a purpose, and would demoralize our allies.  We were ready to agree to a gradual pullback of forces as part of a condition-based strategy; as those goals for which we are fighting would be achieved, such as standup of Iraqi forces and/or a drop in levels of violence, we could carry such a strategy out.  4. (C) Qazi kept coming back to the "timetable" idea (COMMENT: In fairness, it is much loved by Sunni Arabs of all stripes. Kurds hate the idea, and the Shia are torn between their minds--keep the Coalition here, and their hearts--out with the foreigners.  END COMMENT)  He asked if there were some way to "meld" both a timetable and a set of conditions. Charge pointed out that this would only be a disguised timetable, that all including American citizens would see through immediately.  5. (C) COMMENT: There is no telling what Qazi will discuss with the Sunni Arabs, but he is well disposed towards us and goes into any Middle Eastern negotiation or debate with his eyes wide open.  He is feeling some heat from New York, as he complained in particular of the strong ties that senior UN officials Brahimi and Benomar still maintain with Iraqi figures.  END COMMENT Jeffrey

Ensher. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C/NF) Summary.  State Minister Khadim has finally gotten full control of the NGO Registry Office previously managed by the Council of Ministries, and is planning to convene the Second National NGO conference.  However, budget constraints and recent talk of eliminating all state ministries has impeded conference preparations and the state ministry 2005 work plan.  End summary.  ---------------------------------------- NGO REGISTRY OFFICE FINDS PERMANENT HOME ----------------------------------------  2. (C/NF) State Minister for Civil Society Affairs (CSA), Ala'a Habib Khadim, told PolOff on June 12 that the NGO Registry Office (NGO RO) has finally completed its 6-month odyssey originating from the Ministry of Planning with a temporary stop at the Council of Ministries before finally settling at CSA.  Khadim explained that his Ministry is now undeniably in charge of registering NGO's.  The office can catch up on the backlog of 2,000 NGO registration applications.  ------------------------------------------ PREPARATIONS FOR THE SECOND NGO CONFERENCE ------------------------------------------  3. (C) Khadim outlined a plan for hosting the Second National NGO Conference scheduled for the end of June, a follow-up to the conference held last fall by the former State Minister Dr. Mamou Othman.  Khadim intends to invite 800 representatives of the NGO community throughout Iraq, stipulating that at least 20 NGOs from each governorate will be invited. He concedes that most attendees will be coming from the Baghdad area.  Conference objectives include promoting networking among NGOs, encouraging NGO opportunities in oft-ignored provinces, warning against NGOs that exist solely for the sake of member employment, stressing volunteerism among NGO members, and channeling civil society input into the constitution development process.  Whereas last year's conference cost approximately USD 116,000, this year's budget has been trimmed to USD 80,000.  Unfortunately, Khadim lamented, the conference remains unfunded despite his requests to the Council of Ministries and the Prime Minister's office.  ----------------------------------- STATE MINISTRY BATTLES FOR SURVIVAL -----------------------------------  4. (C) Khadim stated that while he pushes forward with his 2005 work plan, his ministry has recently come under threat by Secretary General of the Council of Ministries who suggested that all state ministries should be eliminated, in particular Women's Affairs and Civil Society Affairs.  According to Khadim, the Secretary General regards state ministers as nothing  SIPDIS more than government consultants.  ------- COMMENT -------  5. (C/NF) Khadim continues to both define his ministry while fighting for its survival.  With his wife, Khadija al-Jabiry (a Baghdad Provincial Council member, women's activist, and head of a Baghdad NGO) serving as his key advisor, his ministry appears to be shifting from an "NGO control" focus to an advocate for the NGO community.  However, this may not be sufficient to overcome both the Council of Ministry's desire to eliminate state ministries and the NGO community's wish to be free of government control and oversight.  6.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002517  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/2015 TAGS: EPET, ECON, EFIN, ENRG, IZ, MASS, MOPS, Energy Sector, Petrolium SUBJECT: IRAQIS EXPECT NORTHERN OIL PRODUCTION TO INCREASE BY END OF YEAR  REF: BAGHDAD 2298 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By:  ACTING ECONOMIC COUNSELOR JAMES BOUGHNER FOR REASONS 1.  4 B AND D.  1.  (C) SUMMARY: Production capacity in the Northern Oil Company (NOC) fields will increase from 450,000 bpd to 768,000 bpd by Dec 31, 2005 when NOC well workovers are completed, according to the Director General (DG) of the Northern Oil Company.  The constriction on oil exports will be the capacity of Al Fathah Crossing and the timing of the completion of the 42-inch pipeline from Kirkuk to the northern export pipeline to Turkey.  The DG does not think there will be sufficient natural gas produced in the north to support the installed electric power generators in the North by late 2005.  Northern Gas Company will have excess processing capacity for gas unless NOC produces gas from more wells, and additional infrastructure is repaired.  DGs of both the Northern Gas and Oil Companies complain the Infrastructure Security Battalions have so far not only proved ineffective in protecting oil and gas infrastructure, but may themselves be responsible for some attacks. END SUMMARY  2. (U) ECONOFF traveled recently to Kirkuk and Al Fatah with PCO, IRMO, and JCCI to meet with the Directors General of the Northern Oil (Adil Al-Qazzaz) and Gas (Jabbar Al-liaebi) Companies and observed the ongoing activities for repairing the pipeline crossing and security operations at Al Fathah. Kirkuk-area oil and gas infrastructure, repairs and renovations undertaken by the PCO and its contractors were observed in the field locations and then briefed in detail to ECONOFF.  --------------------------------------------- -- EXPECTED OIL EXPORT CAPACITY FROM NORTHERN IRAQ --------------------------------------------- --  3.  (SBU) Production in the oil sector is expected to increase according to the DG of the Northern Oil Company (NOC) as the US contracted work is completed on the oil field infrastructure.  The DG explained how the oil and gas production would increase with the completion of the oil well workovers, the connection and renovations of the gas-oil separation plants, compressor stations, pump stations and pipeline replacements over the next six months.  NOC is drilling five new wells and two additional wells are undergoing workovers by the Iraqi Drilling Company.  He said the new production would rise to 768,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of 2005.  He estimated this would provide 500,000 bpd for export via the Northern Export Pipeline through Turkey to the terminal at Ceyhan. The DG stated the NOC has exported up to 1.35 mbpd in the past when daily production was 1.5 mbpd.  He proudly said, "NOC has a very good record of production."  The DG of NOC was concerned with the speed of the construction at the Al Fathah crossing, speculating that his production increases might exceed the capacity of the pipelines to carry crude oil over the crossing.  He said until the 42-inch pipeline is completed and secured, exports to the north are subject to stoppages from attacks, limited capacity in terms of through-put volume of pipelines, and maintenance failures.  --------------------------------- MAINTENANCE OF OIL INFRASTRUCTURE ---------------------------------  4.  (SBU) Maintenance and availability of spare parts are the greatest concern of the DG of NOC.  He said, "we have no spares and we have no preventative maintenance program".  The DG of NOC explained that he had "no O&M plan for NOC", primarily because he did not have the parts or budget to implement a maintenance operations plan.  NOC did originally host the Oil Training Institute for Iraq, however, all of the equipment in the laboratories had been looted after the most recent war.  He told us he would like to have new laboratory equipment provided by reconstruction funding to reestablish the Training Institute, and he thought that would greatly help his maintenance and training needs.  He will also forward his annual budget request which will include annual funding for the training institute to MOO, as well as to IRMO who are working with USAID to assess the need and available resources.  -------------------------------------------- GAS PRODUCTION WILL NOT EXPAND FOR 2-3 YEARS --------------------------------------------  5.  (SBU) The NOC DG explained that gas production would not expand immediately, but rather he expected additional gas production in 2-3 years, when NOC tapped a gas field east of Kirkuk.  The DG said NOC would not provide sufficient increases in natural gas this year for the Northern Gas Company to process with their second train of gas processing capacity.  The DG stated, "We cannot produce more than 300 mmscf of associated gas, and we need to develop more oil fields" to produce sufficient associated gas to fully utilize the capacity of the plant.  ------------------------------- NATURAL GAS PROCESSING CAPACITY -------------------------------  6.  (SBU) The DG of the Northern Gas Company (NGC) provided a briefing on the NGC production and ongoing renovations in the Kirkuk area.  Primarily he provided the information that when the second gas train (Natural gas processing facility) is repaired in Kirkuk, this will increase the capacity to over 500 mmscf per day.  The PCO had planned this repair, but it would provide excess capacity for processing natural gas, beyond the 300 mmscf, which the DG for NOC said he could produce in the NOC oil fields. The DG for the NGC said he knew there was insufficient capacity of current gas production, and that there was a great need to tap additional oil and gas fields and repair the remainder of the gas-oil separation plants in the northern oil fields to provide sufficient natural gas to meet the demands of the electric power sector and the fertilizer plant.  ----------------------- INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY -----------------------  7.  (C) The DG of NOC was very concerned about pipeline security deficiencies, especially at the Al Fathah crossing over the Tigris.  He made multiple negative comments about the Oil Security Battalions and thought that these units were responsible for many of the attacks against the pipelines, valves, and other oil infrastructure targets.  He thought the $100 million spent on hiring tribal forces to protect the pipeline was a resort to blackmail and extortion from the tribes along the pipeline from Kirkuk to Al-Fathah.  "We need a reliable military guard force with 24 hour-guards, 200-300 meters apart along the entire pipeline" if we want to keep exporting oil, stated the DG of NOC.  He said, "NOC can produce the oil, but cannot guarantee its export."  ------------------------------- AL-FATHAH SECURITY OBSERVATIONS -------------------------------  8.  (C) The Al-Fathah oil pipeline-crossing site is currently guarded by newly recruited members of the infrastructure security forces.  There were five observable guard sites near the crossing; two tent sites on either bank of the Tigris with approximately five guards each, and one tent with five guards on the highway bridge next to the three pipelines, which are laid across the surface of the bridge.  These guards each have one AK-47 and two magazines of ammunition. There are no communications at or between the sites, nor is there any visible command and control presence.  There are no defensive structures, and the guards appear to have had no training and incomplete uniforms. Their families provide the guards meals.  There are additional forces guarding the checkpoints approaching the crossing on the two main roads. Concertina wire is laid near the pipelines on the east side of the river.  ------- COMMENT -------  9. (C) COMMENT:  The Northern Oil Company Director General is very upbeat about increased oil production from the Kirkuk oil fields.  The estimates of the Director General of NOC are in line with the PCO projections. The security situation and the inability to export oil due to lack of finished and secured pipelines reduces income from the northern Iraqi oil fields.  If the production does reach 768,000 bpd by December 2005, and 500,000 bpd is available for export, this Kirkuk crude, currently selling at $44.30 per barrel at Ceyhan FOB, would earn Iraq $1.886 billion per quarter, or  $7.545 billion per year.  This amount of additional income for Iraq, if actualized, could buy a lot more than just oil infrastructure security.  END COMMENTS    Jeffrey

"The government's program" (6/15)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a page four editorial by Abdul Munim Al-Assam about Al-Jafari's political program:  "All politicians know that a government's program must call for unity and represent the diverse voices of all people it represents. A successful program doesn't only speak in the name of the majority, nor does it represent the authority of a specific leadership. A successful program must encourage all political parties, parliamentary blocs and civil society organizations to participate in the political process without restraint. A successful program must strive to end all conflicts and disagreements amongst all political parties and sects. It must also call for the reconciliation of all its members.  Unless there is unity, trust, and cooperation in the government, its promises will not be trusted, it will not be able to achieve its goals and the hopes and dreams of its people will not be realized.  A successful program avoids mismanagement and its programs are creatively drafted.  It must include all of the joint visions and opinions of its people and it must represent the ambitions of all sects, ethnicities, and societal components.  Writing the government's program is a difficult process. Politicians must be able to use the science of tactics, the art of reconnaissance, and the skill of an economics professor. The program must avoid using confusing idioms and never include deceit.  I recall these points when reading Al-Jafari's political program.  It reads more like a testament of his own personal viewpoint than like a political program.  In fact Al-Jafari's program is so far from being a true political program that it is like the difference between a star and a moon."   B. "Our weapon and their weapon" (6/15)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a third-page editorial by Dr. Ali Khalif about the developments of the security situations in Iraq:  "Day by day we see that the security situation is getting better. We have noticed that the efforts of Operation Lightning have started to yield tangible results.  The number of terrorist attacks has started to decrease. This gives us hope that terrorism will end within the next few days.  The cooperation between the Ministries of Defense and the Interior has brought us this improvement in the security situation.  However, there has been a wave of statements in the media that have attempted to characterize Operation Lightning as a negative undertaking.  No matter what they have said, we are certain that the brave men of Operation Lightning will terminate terrorism.  We are also certain that our security forces are able to provide security and stability in Iraq and will continue to do so once the terrorists are gone.  As we have always said and will continue to say, the future will be for honest Iraqis. Iraq has no place for terrorists.  The government is putting an end to the terrorists so of course they are attempting to stop the new day from dawning in Iraq.  The terrorists are trying to recreate instability in our country by their chaotic and random attacks.  But they will not succeed.  It is their ignorance and hatred that will be their undoing.  They have played out their hands and have nothing more to do but admit their incompatibility with the future and surrender.  They cannot stop Iraqis from building a united and democratic Iraq.  Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi said that Iraq's enemies are armed with ferocity, terrorism, car bombs and beheadings.  They want to stop our progress and we must be armed with our people's support.  He also said that we must rehabilitate our security forces.  Therefore, it is clear what weapon terrorism uses and its ideology is known to everyone. At the same time, the government's weapon is also clear.  It is represented by the brave Iraqi people, who defeated terrorism on Election Day and will continue to defeat it in each upcoming battle because the future is for Iraq and honest Iraqis."  JEFFREY

(SBU) SUMMARY: Iraqi Minister of Trade Abd' al-Bassit Kareem is confident the Public Distribution (food ration) System (PDS) has enough wheat and rice supplies for the months of June and July.  The Minister, who has discussed the Arab League Boycott (ALB) demarche (reftel) with Prime Minister Ja'afari, noted that any legal revisions specifically related to ALB would not currently be possible given political sensitivities.  He will however, look into the possible issuing of instructions that would have the effect of stopping its ministerial enforcement.  In addition, the Minister will not be ready to submit Iraq's accession documents to the World Trade Organization until mid-July.  He is amenable to making a submission announcement at the Joint Economic Committee meeting tentatively scheduled for July 11 and hopes to sign the proposed U.S.-Iraq Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) at the same time. END SUMMARY.  2. (SBU) On June 14, Charge and EconOffs met with Minister of Trade Abd' al-Bassit Kareem in order to express concern over increasing reports of problems with the Public Distribution (food ration) System (PDS).  Our polling shows a recent uptick in the number of complaints of no or delayed PDS-supply deliveries throughout the country. Minister Kareem acknowledged our information claiming that problems stem from the previous administration's mismanagement that resulted in empty warehouses.  That is currently being remedied according to the Minister.  3. (SBU) Minster Kareem cited his cooperation with the Minister of Finance on a financing/contracting committee headed by DPM Chalabi that meets twice weekly.  According to the Minister, this gives him the opportunity to discuss planned PDS purchases and ensure the Ministry of Finance provides the funding (problematic in the first quarter of 2005.)  In addition, the Minister informed us that the Ministry of Trade (MOT) did an emergency procurement of 255 thousand metric tons (MT) of wheat and 20 thousand MT of sugar in order to get through the months of May, June and July.  One million tons, more or less, remains to be purchased this year in order to meet Iraqi needs.  The Minister believes that he can begin to create a buffer stock with this purchase.  He also informed us that a committee investigating allegations against Australian wheat (septels) has determined that the remaining wheat, some 150,000 metric tons is fit for consumption and should be distributed.  The Minister noted that the Ministry of Health publicly certified the wheat as well.  4. (SBU) Minister Kareem believes that a focus on greater efficiency will create positive changes in the PDS system very quickly.  For example, he is working to sort out discrepancies in the allocation of PDS supplies to various governorates.  He mentioned that it was brought to his attention that Najaf governorate was getting the smallest share of wheat supplies in the country.  He has since reviewed the allocation of supplies and brought Najaf's portion into alignment with those of the other governorates.  The Minister also told us that he intends to fight corruption and substitution of products in the PDS system by announcing purchases to the public.  As part of the announcement he will both show the product and give the quality specifications so that the public will be aware of the type of goods to expect and can report substitution to the MOT when it occurs.  The Minister is confident that there is enough rice in the PDS system for June and July and that upcoming procurements will see the system through the end of 2005.  He will focus the early procurement process on wheat, rice and pulses and intends to only deal with internationally reputable suppliers for PDS commodities, avoiding middlemen.  We again offered our support in this process.  The Minister was grateful and assured us he would be in touch if anything were needed.  5. (SBU) In raising the recent Arab League Boycott (ALB) demarche, Charge Jeffrey citied several examples where acceptable solutions have been found in order to maintain a productive relationship between the U.S. and its trading partners.  He urged the Minister to pursue a decision on the matter.  The Minister explained that he has looked into the ALB matter.  According to Minster Kareem, there is no Iraqi law that implements the ALB.  Instead, directives, issued as "explanation regulations" to the old Investment Law created the practice and some organs of the government are still implementing them irregardless of CPA-era laws. Kareem, who indicated he has raised the issue with PM Ja'afari, went on to explain that specifically mentioning or repealing the boycott is too politically sensitive "impossible" at this time.  He is however willing to issue internal MOT regulations that would rescind regulations requiring MOT institutions from asking about the nationality of firms, etc.  The Charge urged Minister Kareem to address these issues as soon as possible, however, Minister Kareem is traveling to Northern Iraq (Sulaymaniyah) for the next two weeks in order to defend this Ph.D. thesis and is not expected to return to Baghdad in early July.  6.

Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  ------- Summary -------  1.  (C) The Kurdish Yezidi settlement of Mahut in northeast Ninewa, 30 years ago a site of forced re- settlement of Kurds, is today a large village center struggling with the same infrastructure issues as most other Ninewa communities, based on a visit to Mahut on June 13.  Kurds largely re-occupied nine smaller villages surrounding Mahut just after the fall of the former regime, living in houses constructed by Arabs during their 30-year occupation.  Despite Mahut being part of Ninewa, residents fly the flag of Kurdistan and the KDP is building roads with KRG funding.  End Summary.  2.  (U) Elements of the 448th Civil Affairs Battalion of Task Force Freedom visited the village center of Mahut, located about 23 miles northeast of Mosul in Ninewa Province, accompanied by Regional Embassy Office Mosul Poloff, on June 13.  The group also visited a nearby farming village of Mamrashan.  -------------------------------------------- Mahut Village Center Home To Displaced Kurds --------------------------------------------  3.  (U) Village leaders in Mahut said the Yezidi town grew exponentially in 1975 when, after the Algerian Agreement with Iran, Saddam Hussein forcibly removed them from nine nearby villages, giving their houses and property to Arab settlers.  Mahut was surrounded by Arabs and served as a makeshift detention center for the Yezidis, whose Kurdish roots but non-Islamic religion often draws persecution from other people groups in northern Iraq.  Mahut's 15,000 residents today keep their smaller village identification, reportedly grouping close together in the town's cinderblock sprawl.  Mahut shows the same development problems observed in other towns populated by Yezidis. Unemployment is at 75 percent and electricity is limited to a few hours a day, the leaders said. Unhealthy living conditions persist:  raw sewage runs in the streets -- causing frequent cases of typhoid.  ---------------------------------------- Kurds Have Returned to Outlying Villages ----------------------------------------  4.  (U) Village leaders said that many residents returned to their former villages in the immediate aftermath of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  A stop at the nearby village of Mamrashan confirmed this, with Yezidi leaders pointing out that most construction in the village of mud huts was the work of Arabs -- only one house, the house of the village chief, was of Yezidi construction.  Arab occupiers reportedly destroyed the Yezidi temple that once overlooked the village.  The village chief said Arabs abandoned the village when the former regime fell.  Village leaders said they had returned to growing wheat on their land, though they complained that some Arabs had built large homes on their property.  None of the villagers we met had spoken with the government about getting compensation for lost property nor had made claims to the Iraq Property Claims Commission (IPCC).  Leaders in Mahut said more people would return to their original villages if housing were available.  ------------------------------------- KDP Planting the Flag, With KRG Money -------------------------------------  5.  (C) Houses in Mahut and Mamrashan flew the flags of the KDP and of Kurdistan.  Village leaders unanimously gave thumbs-up when asked if they supported the KDP.  The KDP chief for Mahut was the principal interlocutor for the villagers.  He said that a new road being constructed down Mahut's main drag was being built by the KDP, paid for with funds from Dahok Province in Kurdistan.  The doctor in Mahut's sole medical clinic said he received half of his support from Dahok Province despite being locate in Ninewa.  ------- Comment ------- 6.  (C) Thirty years after the upheaval caused by Arabization, Mahut has clear developmental problems like most of the Yezidi settlements in northeastern Ninewa.  Probably, the return of some villagers to their ancestral homes softened some social pressures. Housing shortages for returnees seemed to be a recurring theme.  The area is a bastion of support for the KDP, which seems intent on acting as a de facto government and exerting its influence on the northeastern part of Ninewa.  7.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002536  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/2015 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PTER, IZ, Parliament, Sunni Arab, National Assembly SUBJECT: SUNNI LEADERS ON CONSTITUTION DRAFTING  Classified By: Classified by David M. Satterfield, Deputy Chief of Miss  ion, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) Summary: Sunni Arab leaders will meet members of the TNA constitution committee on June 16 but appear unprepared to settle the dispute over their inclusion.  Both UNAMI SRSG Ashraf Qazi and embassy pushed for 15 additional representatives in separate meetings with Sunni Arab leaders June 15, but no agreement has yet been reached on numbers. The Iraqi Islamic Party and National Dialogue Council are leading two rival blocs of Sunni Arab delegates, but at the moment only the former group is signaling seriousness about joining the process.  More hopefully, a group of leaders allied with the Sunni Waqf told PolOff they were ready to present a unified list of nominees immediately if the USG would meet them halfway.  They dropped their demand from 25 to 20 additional representatives.  They took no solace from U.S. support for "consensus" decision-making in the committee.  They were convinced that the constitutional commission would deadlock on federalism and they said they needed to have the votes when it did.  End summary.  2. (C) Embassy continued rounds of contacts with Sunni Arab leaders on the principle of inclusion in the constitution drafting process.  Sunni Arab leaders met together on the evening of June 14 and 15 and one delegation also visited Muslim Ulema Council leader Harith al-Dari.  They are set to meet at 1000 local time on June 16 in an expanded meeting with Adnan al-Janabi and other representatives of the constitution committee to review their progress.  Substantive arguments aside, much of what we are seeing now is intra-Sunni jockeying for position pre-election.  That's all for the good.  But it greatly complicates our ability to move the Sunnis to a coherent and acceptable "yes" on the constitutional drafting process.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Sunnis Allied with Waqf Make a Stand at 20 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  3. (C) A group of Sunnis allied with the Waqf and Islamic Party would not accept less than 20 additional representatives in a two-hour long meeting with PolOff June 15.  The three men represented the leadership of the "United Iraqi Congress," an umbrella group of 30-plus smaller Sunni parties and tribal shaykhs that actually participated in the January elections.  The group, running as the United Assembly of Mosul Tribes, won 2 seats on the Ninewa Provincial Council and 18,000 votes in the national elections, about the equivalent of half a seat in the body.  They are close to Hatem al-Mukhlis and stated their allegiance to Sunni Waqf head Adnan al-Dulaymi, warning that his removal would be a mistake at this moment.  Mosul Shaykh Anwar al-Nada lead the group, accompanied by his deputy Muhammad Shahab al-Dulaymi, of Ramadi, and political advisor Farman Aziz, also of Mosul.  4. (C) All three men -- sounding a theme we are hearing from others -- were wracked with anxiety that the Shi'a and Kurds are conspiring to all but divide Iraq under the guise of federalism in the constitution.  They said they wanted to work by &consensus8 and appreciate U.S. support for the principle, but they believe consensus will be impossible to achieve.  Therefore, they said, the constitutional debate is bound to come to vote inside the committee/commission, and they want to make sure they have the votes when that day arrives.  They say the Kurds are already forbidding Arabs from entering northern Iraq -- a claim our Kirkuk RC has found valid on occasion.  These Sunni Arab leaders also believe that they represent 40 percent of the population -- six provinces -- and are already compromising by dropping to 25.  5. (C) PolOff offered them three paths to a compromise, but they were not biting:   -- PolOff pointed out that the U.S. is committed to the principle of consensus and is determined that no party be left out or ganged up on in the drafting process.  The U.S. is also opposed to the division of Iraq and committed to a pluralistic, unified and democratic new Iraq.  The United Iraqi Congress members urged the U.S. to find a way to make its commitment to Iraq's unity more public.   They suggested that President Bush make remarks to that end to allay Sunni Arab fears heading into the drafting process.  However, they still wanted 25 additional representatives.  -- PolOff offered that the U.S. is interested in finding a compromise within this compromise.  If the Sunnis compromise on 15 additional full members, perhaps a greater number can then be brought in as experts and advisors on subcommittees. Perhaps the Sunnis can call for a constitution that is especially open to amendment in its early test years. Perhaps higher-level U.S. officials could make assurances on consensus and integration for all additional members.  Here too, the audience reacted with interest but said that they would not risk going to a vote without the numbers.  In a slight compromise, they offered to make sure that Shi'a and Kurds were on their list of additions to the committee, not only Sunnis.  However, they seemed to know as they said this that the Shi'a and Kurds would not trust those delegates any more than the Sunnis would trust delegates chosen for them.   -- PolOff urged the group to prioritize its goals and not sacrifice more important causes over a minor dispute over numbers.  The real keys to the future of the Sunni community are holding new elections on time, avoiding a six-month delay, and deepening the U.S. relationship.  Finding a compromise on the constitution committee would allow them to achieve those other goals.  They nodded, smiled, and said they would simply have to withdraw if given less than 25.  -- Lastly, PolOff questioned the group,s attachment to numbers when the referendum, not the commission or the TNA, will ultimately determine the fate of the constitution.  If the Sunnis control six provinces, as they claimed, then they will always have the ability to vote down a draft they do not like.  They might as well participate to try to avoid that scenario.  Here it was clear that our interlocutors were not so sure they could marshal the numbers to vote down the document.  They were also convinced that voter fraud and militia groups would prevent Sunnis from getting to the polls to vote down a constitutional referendum.  6. (C) The closest thing to a movement came as the final cups of coffee were served and the meeting approached its last half-hour.  Sunni figures said they would drop their demand from 25 to 20, aligning themselves with a compromise we have already heard from the Iraqi Islamic Party and Sunni Waqf. They promised to convey the USG ideas to their committee but said they would settle the deal on the spot for 20 additions and want a "green light" to go forward.  PolOff offered no green light and said that, with a difference so narrow, the group should make the final step rather than sacrifice a historic drafting process and revived US-relationship over a few names.  The men only nodded sadly and responded that the Sunnis already have prepared a joint list of 20 candidates that could be put forward immediately.  They said that every group participated in its formulation except the National Dialogue Council, which they doubted would participate in any event.  (PolOff has, in fact, seen a copy of the list of 25 names that was prepared by Adnan al-Dulaimi).  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Only A Non-Interference Pledge from the Dialogue Council - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  7. (C) EmbOff held a separate meeting with Salah Mutlak of the National Dialogue Council and won only a pledge of non-interference if other groups bow to the number fifteen. Mutlak said he would not block other groups from supporting that number but would not participate in the process in that case.  Instead, he would work on a political campaign for the next elections that would sell his party as one unsullied by what he believes will be a disappointing constitution drafting experience.  Mutlak's mind was already clearly on the next elections and he laid out a plan to join forces in the next government with Iyad Allawi after running separately in the elections.  Mutlak said he planned to explore ways to make sure that the constitution is open to amendment at a time when politics are less sectarian.  8. (C) Despite his assurances of non-interference, Mutlak was still contemplating ways to influence the Sunni representation in the process.  He recommended the idea of UN mediation to resolve the dispute on numbers, a non-starter for Shi'a Arabs.  He also said that, whatever number is chosen, the delegates should be nominated in two concurrent processes.  Major Sunni groups meeting in Baghdad should choose 60-70 percent of the names and quick conferences in the provinces could produce the remaining 30-40 percent. Mutlak was clearly convinced that his allies would fair well in provincial conferences.  He claimed that he himself had been welcomed with fanfare and elected "chairman" at such an assembly in Diyala on June 14.  He said other such conferences were in the works in the near future in Ramadi and Mosul, and he expected both to produce victories for his party and defeats for the Iraqi Islamic Party.  - - - - Comment - - - -  9. (C) Clearly, we are still not at a deal.  The National Dialogue Council is presenting itself as not interested in inclusion, but our Shia and Kurd interlocutors believe the Council will ultimately join -- if we continue to work over Mutlak.  The Sunni Waqf group is serious but fears that the Shi'a and Kurds are conspiring on a federalism plan that will divide Iraq.  More significantly, Sunni Waqf leader Dulaymi is ready to move if PM Jafari - now approved by the Cabinet to remove him office.  Dulaymi, we are told is outbidding his Sunni rivals over the issue of numbers to demonstrate his "Sunni" credentials and thus make his removal more difficult.  Indeed, we believe much of the debate on numbers 25-20-15 Sunnis (or points in between) has far more to do with the struggle for leadership within the Sunni community than it does genuine moves related to the constitution.  The good news here is that virtually all of the key Sunni figures we are dealing with believe elections are coming and are maneuvering to position themselves for the vote.  The bad news is that this maneuvering greatly complicates our ability to get them to a "yes" on joining the constitution drafting process that in acceptable to their Shia and Kurdish partners.  Our best course for now is to stay focused on pressing for 15 as a reasonable outcome, and avoid entering the Sunni political souq.  We will consider other options if this directive strategy does not achieve success in the near future.  End comment.  10. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.

Satterfield, Deputy Chief of Miss  ion, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Key Kurdish leaders told DCM and MNF-I Political Military and Economic Affairs Chief on June 13-14 they could not condone disarming the Kurdish pesh merga forces, or its total dissipation into the Iraqi army.  They realized the sensitivity of Iraq having ethnically-based forces, but said Baghdad must establish a solid record of good intentions and actions before Kurds would feel safe with a fully integrated army.  Some felt the pesh merga could be transformed into a National Guard equivalent.  The leaders differed on the wisdom of the pesh merga assuming a role in border security (Kurdish PM Nechirvan Barzani felt it would be almost impossible, given reservations of neighbors), and on concepts for depoliticizing the forces.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) DCM Satterfield and MNF-I Commander for Political, Military and Economic relations MG Hank Stratman discussed possible options for the Kurdish paramilitary force (pesh merga) with senior KDP and PUK officials in the Kurdistan Region June 13-14.  RC Kirkuk (notetaker) and DCM assistant also attended the meetings.  Pesh to Remain until Kurds Trust Baghdad ----------------------------------------  3.  (C)  KDP leader (and newly sworn in President of Kurdistan-Iraq) Massoud Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdish Regional Government in Irbil, and PUK leaders Noshirwan Mustafa, Kosrat Rasul, and Omar Sayid Ali  told DCM and MG Stratman in meetings June 13-14 that the pesh merga must remain until the Iraqi government is able to convince Kurds that Baghdad will not again turn against them. Democracy was more than words; it would take years to rebuild trust, given the bad blood between the Iraqi government and the Kurds.  4.  (C)  For the same reason, PM Barzani said he could not foresee the pesh coming under control of Baghdad.  Both he and his uncle Massoud said any future arrangement must be jointly agreed between the Kurds and the central government. Massoud -- whose new role as president also confers command of a still-to-be unified pesh merga force -- said he could consider some kind of integration, but only within an established legal framework.  Pesh merga could be deployed to other regions, some individuals could be integrated into Iraqi Army units outside the north, and entire units could be deployed outside the region.  He was willing to discuss these options with Baghdad.  Other pesh merga could be retired, some could be moved into the regular army, some could take civil service jobs.  But some element must remain as pesh merga to maintain security.  5.  (C)  Omar Said Ali, a senior PUK politburo member, told DCM that the pesh merga defended the Kurds from Arab and Islamic movements bent on oppressing minorities.  He said that the Kurds were "uncertain about the future of Iraq and how its army will evolve.  The Kurdish nation is small, its neighbors always want to control us, and quash Kurds' rights.  After 10-15 years, the Kurds may trust the Arabs again, and Iraq's neighbors, then the people might be comfortable without the pesh merga."  After the constitution was ratified, the Kurds could reassess.  The DCM stressed that the U.S. did not favor the "ethnicization" of security forces.  Ali said he understood, but the change could not occur now.  PUK Leaders Foresee Different Options -------------------------------------  6.  (C) DCM and General Stratman probed interlocutors on whether the two parties needed so many forces.  Kosrat Rasul, a famous PUK pesh merga commander (head of the party politburo executive committee) told DCM that some pesh merga were already serving in the Iraqi Army in Kurdistan.  Rasul said others could be reformed as border guards or national guard units.  PUK Deputy Secretary General Noshirwan Mustafa and Rasul also agreed that the forces could be drawn down and integrated into something other than a purely party structure, but they differed on context and approach.  7.  (C)  Rasul defended the current pesh merga structure, which he said was a professionally trained force as compared to the Badr Corps "militia."  Perhaps the pesh merga could be renamed, but they could not be entirely mixed into a pan-Iraqi body.  Only the Kurds were able to maintain security in the mountains, because they knew the area. Furthermore, Kurds would play an anti-terrorism role, protecting Kurdistan, and helping the Iraqi Army when needed.  8.  (C)  Mustafa, on the other hand, while agreeing the pesh could not disband, said they must cease existence as party militias.  The forces both take orders from party leaders, and are not loyal to government.  As such, they posed the main threat to democracy.  They stymie political dialog, as no one dares to speak out because the threat of arms lies behind all words.  9.  (C)  Mustafa said the pesh could become like a U.S. national guard unit, part of the Iraqi Army, funded by Baghdad, but still distinct.  They must be loyal to both Kurdistan and Baghdad, not political parties.  Meanwhile, Baghdad should show the Kurds it was willing to put the Iraqi Army under civilian control, and keep military spending low, perhaps no more than 5% of the budget.  The non-Kurdish units of the army should not have an automatic right to enter Kurdistan.  U.S. Protection Would Allow Pesh Reductions ------------------------------------------- 10.  (C)  Mustafa said that a U.S. presence in the north would allow the Kurds to draw down forces as it would convince the Kurds that neither the Iraqi nor Iranian armies would intervene in Kurdish affairs, it was a major desire of most Kurds.  Ali felt that the Kurds should receive some kind of U.S. protection similar to that provided to Israel.  Kurds Fill Security Vacuum on the Borders, but Formal Role a Problem for Neighbors ------------------------------------------  11.  (C)  MG Stratman asked if the two parties would be receptive to the idea of pesh merga providing border security in the north, a move that would make non-Iraqi forces there redundant.  The DCM noted that such a role would be coordinated with Turkey. President Barzani said that if appropriate arrangements were made, a border security role might be possible.  He said the pesh merga were aleady filling a vacuum in the mountainous north.  12.  (C)  When MG Stratman asked whether pesh merga deployments along the border were currently coordinated with the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad, which had line authority for this function, President Brzan sad that Baghdad has no capability on the northern borders.  He said the new constitution should work this out.  Thereafter, the KRG MOI or pesh merga ministry and Baghdad MOI would have a legal framework to determine their respective roles.  13.  (C)  Nechirvan Barzani said that a pesh merga border force likely would not be accepted by Iran or Turkey.  On that note, he said it was important for Turkey to understand the Kurds were serious about fighting the PKK.  He said without exception Iraqi soil should not be used to harm its neighbors.   14.  (C)  It is no surprise that the Kurds wish to retain some capacity to repel aggression, given their history with Baghdad.  How this can be resolved without unduly entrenching ethnic divisions nationwide remains to be seen.  In Iraq, where money is a frequent precursor for loyalty, perhaps Mustafa's option of a national guard type unit, paid by Baghdad yet distinct, is worth exploring further.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002542  SIPDIS  STATE FOR R, IIP, NEA, NEA/I, NEA/PPD EMBASSIES/CONSULATES FOR PAOS  E.O. 12958:  N/A TAGS: KPAO, PGOV, PTER, SCUL, IZ SUBJECT:  Dr. Anthony Cordesman U.S. Speaker Program in Iraq: June 3-11, 2005  1. Summary:  Dr. Anthony Cordesman of CSIS participated in an eight-day speaker program in Iraq (Baghdad and Al- Hillah) June 3-11, 2005.  His program included meetings and events with senior officials and opinion leaders from all major ethnic and sectarian elements of Iraqi society, and representatives of the full Iraqi political spectrum. The discussions covered all aspects of Iraqi political, security, energy and ethnic/sectarian issues.  Dr. Cordesman used his program events to provide his perspective on how to best counter the insurgency in Iraq, on building a viable state and society, and on Iraq as an aspect of broader political developments in the Mideast.  He also used his discussions to plumb current Iraqi views on the country's progress towards democracy and the continuing U.S. role in that process.  Because Dr. Cordesman is so well known, this program had a major impact in engaging key Iraqi officials and opinion leaders at the highest levels, and received positive Iraqi broadcast and print media coverage, with at least seven press placements to date.  End Summary.  2.  Dr. Cordesman began his program with three full days spent visiting Iraqi military and security forces, accompanied by the U.S. military, throughout the country. This comprehensive overview of the security environment in Iraq included operational units as well as training and command and control centers of both the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, in addition to American and NATO experts and advisers.  This prelude to his speaker program activities enriched and strengthened his credibility with his Iraqi (and, likely, future American) audiences.  3.  A short trip into the Red Zone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided the first venue for a Cordesman lecture.  About 100 Iraqi officials, including the head of the Transitional National Assembly's foreign affairs committee, heard Dr. Cordesman say that the circumstances in Iraq most resembled - at least superficially - the U.S. engagement in Vietnam, with the huge difference that both Americans and Iraqis have so far avoided the major mistakes which doomed that conflict.  There is a realization that political means, not military measures alone, will defeat the insurgency.  Unlike in Vietman, the Iraqi military and security forces that are being built are not so dependent on American supplies and weapons for their survival. These local forces are getting stronger and better trained every month.  The Iraqi democracy is already more mature and successful than anything in South Vietnam ever was.  4.  But, noted Cordesman, major challenges remain: ensuring that corruption is curtailed; strengthening local government presence in the governorates; winning over the people by ensuring full political participation by all groups; and splitting the insurgency's base between the disgruntled and the unredeemable hardcore -- are all urgent priorities.  He added that Iraq will succeed or fail by the efforts of the Iraqis alone; America can and will help, but the final arbiters of victory will be the Iraqi people.  5.  Dr. Cordesman also discussed oil policy and how a dependence on petroleum alone cannot build a prosperous and stable Iraqi economy.  He spoke as well about domestic politics in America and the situation in Iraq - how popular ambivalence about the American presence in Iraq is matched by strong support for the U.S. military. As with all his sessions, dialogue was lively and very positive. He was treated as something of a cross between an oracle and a rock star. There were many more questions than could be answered before Cordesman's security detail shepherded him back to the International Zone.  6.  The same themes continued in the next event, a lunch hosted by the Charge' which gathered a top level audience, including the Ministers of Interior and Finance, the National Security Advisor, the Minister of State for National Security, and several key generals involved in the ongoing "Operation Lightning" campaign to weed out terrorists from Baghdad.  7.  A follow-on press event with the Iraqi media, covering the issues discussed above, has so far generated seven very positive press placements: articles in five dailies: "Al-Adala" (SCIRI), "Al-Furat" (Independent), "Al-Mu'atamer" (INC), "Al-Manar al-Yawm" (Independent) and "Kul al-Iraq" (Independent) and prime-time news coverage on the leading "Al-Iraqiyya" television and private "Al-Salam" TV (moderate Shi'a) stations. Additional placements are expected in weekly and monthly publications.  8.  On June 9, Dr. Cordesman traveled to Regional Embassy Office (REO) Al-Hillah, in Iraq's Shi'a heartland.  At the REO he spoke to an enthusiastic and varied audience of about 75 local leaders, including five Transitional National Assembly deputies, regional and local officials, NGO activists, academics, journalists and several Interior and Defense Ministry generals.  9.  This event was a highlight of his program; his presentation was extended by a lively dialogue that went on for over three hours.  Cordesman generously answered each and every question, which ranged from security issues (e.g., a plea for American heavy weapons for the Iraqi armed forces; answer: in fighting an insurgency the right tactics and training are more important than tanks) to political developments (e.g., complaints about American "coddling" of Sunni Arabs: "You talk about Sunnis all the time; what about our rights? We participated in the elections and they refused to"). In Al-Hillah, as throughout his program, Cordesman stressed the need for an inclusive Iraqi political process as the key for victory against the insurgents.  10.  Upon his return from AL-Hillah, Dr. Cordesman was feted at a dinner hosted by former IIG Council of Ministers Secretary Zuheir Hammadi.  The attendants included Minister of Interior Jaber, the head of MFA Policy Planning, and other senior officials and advisors.  11.  Comment:  Dr. Cordesman was a superb, thoughtful and comprehensive speaker who help us engage Iraqi officials and opinion leaders at the highest level in dialogue on a wide range of policy issues of highest interest to this Mission.  His graciousness and deep knowledge of so many topics truly impressed his large and enthusiastic Iraqi audiences, who navigated various security gauntlets to attend his programs.  Many thanks to IIP, NEA/I, REO Al- Hillah, and Embassy Amman for helping make this program happen, and especially to Embassy Kuwait for facilitating his last-minute, middle-of-the-night transit through Kuwait to Washington after he was delayed for two very frustrating days at the Baghdad Airport in the grips of a massive sandstorm.

Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  ------- Summary -------  1.  (C) Members of the Islamic Organization for Human Rights (IOHR) told Poloff June 9 that abuse of detainees by Iraqi Police (IP) occurs regularly.  The group has investigated at least 25 specific allegations of torture and abuse, compiled into a public report, associated with a group of police commandos known as the Wolf Brigade.  The IOHR representatives said they had not received complaints about Coalition Forces treatment of detainees, though they did accuse Coalition soldiers of excesses and disrespectful behavior during operations and said they held the Coalition, as an occupying force, as ultimately responsible for all human rights violations.  The group requested assistance in arranging visits to both Iraqi and Coalition detention facilities.  The organization's members came across as credible, and their allegations about the Wolf Brigade are consistent with other reporting.  U.S. officials have raised these allegations with Mosul officials. Local authorities and the police evince determination to improve the situation, but they want help from the Ministry of Justice and the judicial system.  End summary.  2.  (C) Regional Embassy Office Mosul Poloff met on June 8 with IOHR representatives Haarith Ibraheem (IOHR director), Usama Sadi (deputy director), and Qais Abdulwahab Issa (an IOHR member and REO Mosul IV nominee).  Ibraheem and Issa are legal professors in the Mosul area and Sadi has a master's degree in international law.  ------------------------------------ An Islamic Human Rights Organization ------------------------------------  3. () The IOHR was founded just after the fall of the former regime, which had prohibited human rights organizations, and has its main offices in Mosul and a branch in Baghdad.  Ibraheem said that volunteers formed the organization to document human rights abuses.  Sadi said the group had regularly visited jails and prisons in the Mosul area, including the main Coalition detention facility, prior to the November 2004 outbreak of insurgent activity.  Sadi said the group's methodology requires multiple sources for documenting abuse, usually with eyewitnesses, second hand sources, and photographic evidence. According to the group's literature, they have issued several reports on detainee conditions in Mosul, the western Ninewa city of Tel Afer, and Abu Ghraib prison.  Ibraheem said his organization participated in an international human rights conference in Jordan last September at which he started up contacts with international human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).  4.  (C) Philosophically, the group claims an Islamic conception of human rights emanating from the freedoms granted by Allah.  The representatives said they subscribe to most international human rights standards except for women's rights, which has a distinct treatment in the Koran.  The group claims to defend all people regardless of religion or ethnicity; the group's reports, for example, do not identify the victims by faith or ethnic group.  The representatives stated their complete rejection of terrorism.  They denied any affiliation to political parties, though they conceded that the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) often lobbies authorities to let IOHR conduct prison visits.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Allegations Against the 2nd Iraqi Police Commandos --------------------------------------------- -----  5.  (C) The group released in May a new report documenting 25 cases of detainee abuse, the majority of which are related to the 2nd Iraqi Police Commandos Unit, known as the Wolf Brigade, that was stationed in Mosul earlier this year.  Sadi claimed that six detainee deaths occurred as a result of torture.  The group described practices such as use of stun guns, hanging suspects from their wrists with arms behind back, holding detainees in basements with human waste, and beatings.  Sadi said interrogators also reportedly threatened detainees with demeaning acts against their wives and sisters, a particularly flagrant violation to a Muslim.  Sadi said some detainees were forced to confess to crimes -- not all related to terrorism, Sadi admitted -- they did not commit as a result of this treatment.  (Note:  REO Mosul forwarded this report in Arabic to Embassy Baghdad for translation. End note.)  6.  (C) Issa said that Iraqi Police continue to violate detainees' rights to due process and presumption of innocence.  He said Mosul judges had issued release orders for some detainees only to have them ignored by the Mosul Chief of Police.  Issa said even after the decision is made not to charge detainees with a crime, they are turned over to Iraqi Police facilities for a week before release, during which time abuse occurs. (Note: Iraqi officials recently visited the MNF-NW Detention facility, the Mosul Regional Correctional Facility and the Police stations.  In the first two instances, provincial council representatives noted that the detainees were treated well.  In the case of the police facilities, the PC noted overcrowding and unsanitary conditions attributable to the lack of effort by Iraqi courts to try the cases of almost 1000 detainees in Ninewah.  They also noted allegations of abuse mostly attributable to the Wolf Brigade but also the local police.  End Note.)  --------------------------------------------- -- Coalition Forces Mistreat and Disrespect Iraqis --------------------------------------------- --  7.  (C) Asked whether they alleged abuse of detainees by Coalition Forces, the group said they believed detainees are treated with respect, though they noted they had not been permitted to enter a Coalition facility since November.  Ibraheem said IOHR holds the Coalition, as an occupying force, responsible for all human rights abuses that occur.  Ibraheem mentioned that the Coalition was holding four or five women from the Mosul area, which he said is particularly offensive for Muslims.  Poloff reminded them that the Coalition monitors such issues closely, provides human rights training for IP, and intervenes when cases merit.  Issa accused Coalition soldiers of excesses during operations, including the indiscriminant shooting of civilians, disrespect of civilians during raids, and theft of property.  Issa alleged that his own father and brother were shot by Coalition Forces months earlier as they were driving through the infamous Yarmuk Traffic Circle in Mosul, a favorite target for insurgent IEDs.  ---------------------------------- Request to Visit Jails and Prisons ----------------------------------  8.  (C) The IOHR said their two objectives are to resume visits to Coalition and Iraqi detention facilities and to bring about prosecutions of human rights violators within the IP.  They said they had yet to be granted access to detention centers in Irbil in Kurdistan where some detainees are taken.  Sadi said he had tried to be included in a visit by a Provincial Council Member to the Coalition facility at Mosul Airfield three weeks earlier but was denied entry.  Task Force Freedom (TFF) told him to clear his request for a visit with the Ninewa Provincial Government, but he has yet to receive a response.  ----------------------------- Human Rights Committee Active -----------------------------  9.  (C) The Ninewah Provincial Council Human Rights Committee is now actively following all of the detention facilities and has good oversight of the detention operations.  Their engagement has contributed to the government efforts to:  --transfer 384 prisoners awaiting trial from police custody to the MRCF (relieve overcrowding in the police jail) --transfer 334 prisoners to the Transportation Jail to await trial (relieve overcrowding in the police jail) --send 100 prisoners to Baghdad to be tried there (where legal capacity is better than Mosul)  In addition, MNF-NW is:  --conducting a detention training program to improve quality of standards for detention --meeting with Governor, Vice Governor and Police Chief to remind all parties that the judgments of Iraqi courts must be respected and the conditions of detainment must be improved.  ------- Comment -------  10.  (C) Whatever the political agenda of the IOHR, its representatives come across as credible and qualified.  Their allegations about the Wolf Brigade are consistent with other reports received by TFF. And to this date a mechanism has not been agreed to by TFF, the IA, and the IP for granting NGOs access to Iraqi detention facilities.  Gaining access for NGOs like IOHR to detention facilities would hopefully establish a more rational basis from which to engage human rights organizations.  There is a determination on the part of both the government and police to improve the situation, but to reduce the overcrowding (a main contributor to conditions leading to abuse) they must have better support from the Minister of Justice and an independent Iraqi judiciary to get trials going.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: On the margins of the June 14 swearing-in of Massoud Barzani as Kurdistan Regional President in Irbil, DCM engaged leaders from all Iraqi political groups to urge them to support the inclusion of 15 credible Sunnis in the constitutional committee.  All interlocutors were supportive of our approach, but with varying degrees of optimism regarding the ability of the fragmented Sunni political elite to come together on names or numbers.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------- ENGAGING KEY LEADERS ON SUNNI INCLUSION ---------------------------------------  2. (C) On June 14, on the margins of a ceremony to swear-in KDP leader Massoud Barzani as president of the Kurdistan-Iraq Regional Government, DCM (accompanied by MNF-I Deputy Chief of Staff for Political, Military and Economic Operations MG Hank Stratman) pressed key Iraqi leaders to settle the issue of the constitutional committee with an inclusive process that brings in up to 15 Sunnis.  DCM spoke separately with President Jalal Talabani; Vice President Adel Abdul-Mehdi; Hassan Hamoudi, chairman of the constitutional committee in the TNA; Hachem al-Hassani, speaker of the TNA; Kurdistan-Iraq Regional President Massoud Barzani; and incoming Prime Minister of the Kurdistan-Iraq (unified) Regional Government Nechirvan Barzani to drive home the urgency of resolving the Sunni constitutional role.  He asked them to weigh in with both Sunnis and their own constituencies to ensure positive outcomes.  DCM noted that the most senior levels of the USG are concerned at the prospect of further delays in the process, as this would benefit the insurgents and cause Iraqis to lose hope in the electoral process.  3. (C) In a detailed discussion touching on a range of constitutional issues, Hassan Hamoudi told Charge that he could accept limiting the numbers of Sunnis to 15.  He said that Sunni Waqf leader Sheikh Adnan Dulaymi wielded real influence on this issue, but he was playing a spoiler role because he believed he was about to be relieved from his post.  DCM said the U.S. was prepared to weigh in with Ja'aferi to prevent this, and committed to continued U.S. efforts with Dulaymi directly.  4. (C) Adel Abdul Mahdi and Hachem Hassani were both more skeptical that they, or we, could win broad Sunni acceptance of the latest initiative.  The Sunnis are pressing for larger numbers because they are not united.  Both leaders advised DCM to weigh in with Salah Mutlaq, although Abdul-Mehdi said he believes in the end the U.S. would simply have to choose 15 names from the Sunni list and "have done with it." Hammoudi told DCM that he had a fallback plan to constitute a separate advisory committee of 57 Sunnis, whom the constitutional committee would consult with weekly to solicit views.  Hammoudi said he would not broach this "plan B" unless all else failed, viewing it as unwieldy and less than likely to gain Sunni support.  DCM agreed on both points, noting that Iraqis must keep the process within the (enlarged) committee.  Hammoudi also reiterated concern regarding the UN, saying that "some Sunnis" are listening to "some voices from the UN" and expect that "Ashraf Qazi would come at the end as their savior" to arbitrate the issue of Sunni inclusion.  Hammoudi dismissed such talk as "dangerous nonsense."  For his part, Hassani said he would be traveling in the next week, but would weigh in with key figures upon his return.  --------------------------------------------- -- BARZANI WILL ENGAGE SUNNIS IN BAGHDAD AND IRBIL --------------------------------------------- --  5. (C) Massoud Barzani said he had twice convened Sunnis before the elections to urge them to participate in elections, but most had been too afraid to vote.  This would not happen again because they now realized the price of non-participation.  He said there were some former Ba'athists who were organizing.  They were still waiting in the wings, but the Kurds were exploring engagement.  In the meantime, he committed to weigh in with Adnan Dulaymi, who had asked to come see him upon Barzani's return from Baghdad (on or about June 20).  6. (C) Barzani said he thought that Dulaymi, although a hardliner, would come around to limiting the Sunnis to 15 new members.  Barzani agreed with DCM's characterization of a splintered leadership among Sunnis that complicated all dialog with them.  Sunnis must realize, he said, they are now "only one part of" a political process that includes others. They had not yet adapted to this reality.  DCM agreed they had experienced a psychological earthquake, which had reverberated throughout the whole region.  Barzani claimed that his "longstanding ties" to the Sunni leadership gives him a special influence, greater than that of Kurdish rival President Talabani, whose calls for 25 Sunnis to join the drafting committee had been "unhelpful". ------------------- TALABANI BACKTRACKS ------------------- 7. (C) An upbeat President Talabani told DCM he regretted his earlier ("misinterpreted") call for 25 new Sunnis, and that he too would support the addition of only 15 new members, and committed to work with Iraqi Islamic Party Leader Mohsin Abdul Hamid (present at the swearing in).  KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, in a separate meeting, told DCM that Talabani had felt obliged to publicly support up to 25 Sunnis in order to make amends for his earlier statements supporting the integration of Badr Corps into the Iraqi Army (an idea strongly opposed by the Sunnis).  Nechirvan agreed that President Barzani had credibility with Dulaymi and had agreed to leverage him.  He said that the Kurds would also weigh in with key Shia.  SCIRI leader Abdul-Aziz Hakim was currently in Iran, but the Kurds would follow up upon his return.  He said Hammoudi was also a critical player.  ------------------------------------------- JA'AFERI NOT COMMITTED TO TAL OR THE KURDS? -------------------------------------------  8. (C) Barzani said he believes once the constitutional committee meets, things could move rapidly, perhaps within weeks.  But only if the Shia remained true to their commitment they would treat the TAL as "the" constitutional framework.  If they deviated from the TAL as the foundation -- and there were real fears among Kurds that Ja'aferi would waffle -- it would be an entirely different story.  9. (C) Nechirvan Barzani said the Kurds were very wary of Ja'aferi.  He had not attended the President's swearing in or the Kurdistan National Assembly opening, nor sent greetings, he had stalled on convening the Article 58 committee, he had not mentioned federalism or Kirkuk or the Kurds in his government program, he has never mentioned Kurdish suffering, and he has gutted some of the powers of key Kurdish ministers, such as the Minister of Planning Barham Salih.   10. (C) COMMENT: Barzani is prepared to use his influence with key Sunni leaders, although the meeting with Dulaymi will have to await his return from Baghdad.  Although Abdul-Mahdi and Hassani were more downbeat than usual, they recommended that Embassy continue to work over the Sunni leadership -- notably Mutlaq and Dulaymi -- to press for 15 names coinciding with our own approach.  We will continue to stress that there will be no understanding in Iraq or elsewhere, certainly the U.S., if a consensus-based constitutional drafting process is held up over two or three names.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002552  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/2015 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, KDEM, IZ, Kuristan Regional Government, Kurdistan National Assembly SUBJECT: KRG KURDS DEMAND ACTION ON KIRKUK, ALMOST SEAL DEAL ON COUNCIL  Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David M. Satterfield for reasons   1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (U) This is a REO Kirkuk cable.  2. (C) SUMMARY: Kurdish leaders told DCM and MNF-I DCS for Political Military and Economic Relations June 13-15 that Kirkuk's provincial council will elect new leaders this week, but the two parties -- who are now directly dictating solutions in the city -- had not agreed on exact outcomes. Kurdistan Regional President Massoud Barzani and other senior leaders were adamant that Kirkuk will be Kurdish, most want to see it incorporated into Kurdistan (the PUK deputy was flexible on this option).  Barzani wants the incorporation and boundary changes to be effected more swiftly than provided for in the TAL.  All Kurds are fed up with the lack of progress on Article 58.  The DCM made clear the U.S. commitment to implementation of Article 58, following completion of the Constitution and December elections, but underscored the urgent need for dialogue among all Kirkuk residents and a halt to unilateral steps to predetermine the status of Kirkuk.  END SUMMARY.  3. (C) In meetings with Kurdish leaders in Irbil and Sulimaniya on June 13-15, DCM and MNF-I Deputy Chief of Staff for Political Military Economic Relations reiterated the U.S. commitment on Article 58 of the TAL, but counseled strongly against unilateral political and other steps that could prejudge outcomes on Kirkuk.  RC Kirkuk and DCM Assistant attended the meetings on the U.S. side, Iraqi participants are noted in paragraph 13.  ------------------------------------- KURDS ANGRY NO PROGRESS ON ARTICLE 58 -------------------------------------  4. (C) Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Barzani was generally sour about the lack of progress on Kirkuk.  At his swearing-in June 14, he noted that "a genuine solution has been stipulated in the TAL and must be applied without further delay.  We will not accept retreat.  Similarly, all other detached areas (of Kirkuk) should be returned because they are integral parts of Kurdistan."  5. (C) PUK Deputy Noshirwan Mustafa said the issue of Kirkuk was an emotional one.  Three years before Saddam Hussein was defeated, he sent a delegation that was ready to cede control of the city.  Kirkuk is the geographic center of Iraqi Kurdistan, people transit the city to go from Sulimaniya to Irbil.  It was the center of Iraq's north for 80 years. Indeed, Mustafa said much of the Kurds' pique with the central government centered on Kirkuk.  Iraqi PM Ja'aferi had met with officials in Turkey who had provocative views on Kirkuk.  Ja'aferi had not mentioned Kirkuk or Article 58 in his government program.  6. (C) KRG Sulimaniya Prime Minister Omar Fattah said Kirkuk forms the central struggle for all Kurds.  In 1984, the Iraqi regime offered the Kurds part of the city east of the Khasa River, but the Kurds refused this offer.  That's why we need to implement Article 58 now, so Kirkuk can become part of Kurdistan.  7. (C) The new Kurdistan National Assembly (KNA) speaker Adnan Mufti appealed for U.S. help to address Kirkuk normalization as stipulated in article 58.  He said the Kurdish parties would pay for "Arabization" Arabs to all leave.  When DCM noted that there must be agreement among all parties, Mufti said "you cannot ask me to live next door to the people who shot my brother and raped my sister."  ------------------- DEFINING ARTICLE 58 -------------------  8. (C) Leaders were united on the concept that Arabs must leave and that Kurds must control the province, but were vague on details.  Only Mustafa said that perhaps the province could remain outside Kurdistan, with a separate "special" status.  KDP leaders agreed that dialog between all parties was needed now, but President Barzani insisted that Arabs in (Kirkuk's second city) Hawija were "refusing to cooperate."  Fattah said he had proposed to some Turkish officials to let the Turkmen "live with us in Kirkuk (under KRG administration) for two years, and see if we don't provide them their rights."  9. (C) DCM indicated to both President and PM Barzani that the U.S. would look for ways to activate the Article 58 process in Baghdad.  RC Kirkuk, on the margins of the Barzani meeting, suggested to Iraqi Deputy PM Rowsh Showays a parallel dialog at the provincial level to get community buy-in.  ------------------------- AVOIDING UNILATERAL STEPS -------------------------  10. (C) The DCM in all conversations reiterated the U.S. commitment to TAL 58 but said the U.S. was concerned about unilateral steps -- particularly by the KDP -- in both Kirkuk and Ninewah that could prejudge outcomes in the north.  All Iraqis must have a say in determining the future of Kirkuk and other areas, it was a topic for constitutional drafters; parties must not usurp that process. There must be consensus.  Barzani said he did not understand, if Arabs and Turkmen think Kirkuk will not change, they are mistaken.  Likewise in Ninewah province, the district of Makhmur must return to Irbil.  Sheikhan was 100% Kurdish, Sinjar historically was mostly Kurdish.  The Kurds will not tolerate the perpetuation of Saddam's mistakes.  ---------------------------- CITY COUNCIL - KDP ASCENDANT ----------------------------  11. (C) DCM stressed that the U.S. wanted to move forward on Article 58 and overall assistance on aid coordination, but such efforts required that Kirkuk have a new government that could take decisions. (NOTE:  Kirkuk Provincial Council has been stymied by political infighting among Kurds, and between Kurds, Turkmen and Arab council members, and parties outside the province.)  All interlocutors confirmed that Kirkuk's city council would be formed within days.  PUK and KDP leaders indicated they sent a delegation to Kirkuk June 13 to discuss council formation.  DCM stressed to all that the council should contain credible and authentic members to ensure consensus and build confidence between communities; Kurds were supporting similar efforts at the national level. All leaders agreed and said their respective options would meet that criteria.  12. (C) As on other issues discussed during DCM's trip north (see septels), the two parties differed on Kirkuk leadership.  PUK leaders confirmed that the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF), which had taken 8 seats in the council, should be offered the deputy governor slot.  They felt the Kirkuk Brotherhood List (KBL, the Kurdish led-list) should take the other two slots (governor and council chairman.)  The PUK did not envision any of the top three posts going to Arabs.  KDP leaders, on the other hand, said that the KBL would name all three leaders (and draw a Turkmen from within the Kurd list to become deputy.)  13. (C) Massoud Barzani said that the Mustafa Abdulrahman (KBL independent Kurd) would remain as governor.  He noted there were three contenders for deputy governor and mentioned two names.  (NOTE:  Irfan Kirkukli, previously assistant Kirkuk governor for de-Ba'athification, is a Turkmen who ran with the KBL; and Umid Kurkilu, who is not a council member, is a well-known writer for a Turkmen journal Turkmen Shin, who lives in Altun Kupri, a Turkish-Kurd town on the Green Line that is closely allied with the KDP.)  Nechirvan Barzani confirmed this lineup and added that either Rizgar Ali Hamjan or Ahmed Askeri would be the PUK head of the Kirkuk provincial council.  14. (C) When DCM asked about credible representation of Turkmen and Arab blocs, Barzani said the ITF "was not acceptable" because they were loyal to Turkey and the Arab bloc contained "some Ba'athists."  The PUK's deputy, Noshirwan Mustafa, said that Barzani was holding tough on the city council, and would not permit members of the ITF to take part.  This stemmed from the ITF's desire to put Barzani on trial for his role in the disappearance of senior ITF leaders who were arrested July 13, 1996.  (At the time, Barzani had brought in Iraqi government forces to help defeat the PUK, which was being aided by the ITF.)  The PUK's Speaker Mufti told DCM that Turkmen were divided, and "many were now prepared to join the Kurds" on Kirkuk and other issues.  PUK politburo leader Rasul told DCM that "we cannot marginalize Turkmen and Arabs in Kirkuk."  15.

UNCLAS BAGHDAD 002562  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  STATE PASS USAID  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ECON, EAID, IZ, Parliament SUBJECT:  MINISTRY OF PLANNING BACK AT THE CENTER OF DONOR COORDINATION  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  For government use only.  Not for internet distribution.  1. (SBU) Prime Minister Jaafari has returned primacy in contact with aid donors to the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MoPDC).  2.  (SBU) Planning Minister Barham Saleh told us on June 15 that at a meeting earlier that day Prime Minister Jaafari said he would reverse his decision to make Finance Minister Allawi the ITG's primary point of contact with aid donors and return the role to MoPDC. Saleh told us privately that the PM's decision was fully supported by FinMin Allawi and that he has a good relationship and will work well with Allawi.  Saleh repeated this message on June 16 to representatives of aid donors and other Iraqi ministries--including Finance- -during a meeting of the Iraq Strategic Review Board.  In both venues the Minister highlighted the importance of close collaboration between MoPDC and Finance on economic and development issues.  3.  (SBU) In a separate meeting with Charge and Emboffs on June 16, confirmed Saleh's report.  Allawi took credit for the proposal to leave MoPDC in charge, saying that he had told the PM he had two options, to significantly revamp the donor coordination/reconstruction function-- not feasible in the short tenure of the ITG--or to leave things "as they are" with MoPDC in the lead. He said he and Saleh get along well and will work well together.  4.  (SBU) Comment.  This is a positive development. Donors now have the single primary point of contact in the ITG that they have sought for months, and in Saleh they have an interlocutor who combines political savvy, a market-friendly attitude, and substantive understanding of the issues.  Moreover, the MoPDC has the bureaucratic infrastructure for supporting ITG dialogue with donors that was lacking at Finance.  At the same time, the two ministries are signaling every intention to work much more closely together on the key financing aspects of donor coordination, especially integrating assistance effectively with Iraqi budget resources.  End comment. Jeffrey

Satterfield, Deputy Chief of Miss  ion, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (U)  This is a REO Kirkuk cable.  2.  (C) .  (C) SUMMARY.  Key Kurdish leaders told DCM and MNF-I Political Military and Economic Affairs Chief on June 13-15 that they cannot accept "provincial" or "administrative" federalism and will focus instead on pursuing "historic geographic" federalism.  They define the Kurdistan region however as one with more south-reaching boundaries, a process that the TAL stipulates must not precede the constitution.  END SUMMARY.  3.  (C) DCM Satterfield and MNF-I Commander for Political, Military and Economic relations MG Hank Stratman discussed the federalism with senior KDP and PUK officials in the Kurdistan Region June 13-14.  RC Kirkuk (notetaker) and DCM assistant also attended the meetings.  The issue also surfaced in the context of the swearing-in pf Kurdistan's new president Massoud Barzani on June 14.  Talabani Strikes the Right Tone -------------------------------  4. (C) In his remarks at the swearing in, Iraq's President and PUK Secretary General Jalal Talabani declared that Kurds must seek "a free Kurdistan within a free Iraq."  He spoke at length in Arabic to make visiting Iraqis feel welcome.  He welcomed them not as guests however, but as the "owners of a house in which all of us live as family."  Barzani also kicked off remarks in Arabic, but focused in his speech more on federal and democratic elements of the state, while Talabani focused more on pluralism and unity.  Historic Geographic Federalism ------------------------------  5. (C) PUK Deputy Noshirwan Mustafa focused intently on decentralization.  He said the region was plagued by oriental, Arabic, despotism.  Kurds now have signed on to a unified framework of one state, but only if the Arabs do not attempt to define the state in terms of Arab nationalist goals.  DCM noted that the U.S. supports decentralization, but a clearly delimited one.  Mustafa said Baghdad should allow the regions to develop their own education, judicial, health, agriculture, banking systems, while the center would continue to control defense and foreign affairs.  6.  (C) Both Mustafa and Kurdistan National Assembly speaker Adnan Mufti told DCM that Kurds would never accept "administrative" federalism (Iraq administered on the basis of its 18 governorates).  They both also spoke of "historic geographic" federalism as the better basis for governance. Mustafa indicated said Iraq south of Kurdistan could conceivably be divided into multiple regions.  7.  (C) KRG-Sulimaniya Prime Minister Omar Fattah told DCM that the Kurds are for a united Iraq, but that they constitute a "separate nation."  The Kurdistan region must have strong relations with Baghdad, it should have its own budget like any U.S. state and pay tax to the center.  The Ba'athist model in which the center doled out all the money would not be accepted.  Drawing on the U.S. comparison, DCM said the U.S. government manages natural resources nationally to bring benefit to all citizens.  This should be the model for Iraq.  Independence Does Not Serve Kurds' Interests --------------------------------------------  8.  (C) Mustafa was pragmatic on Kurds' options, noting it would be difficult to settle borders with neighbors who would be hostile.  Further, this independence would shut the Kurds out of a potential market of 22 Arab states.  Independent Kurdistan would be hopelessly weak, but as part of Iraq, would gain great leverage regionally.  He agreed with DCM that the era of mini-states was over.  What the Kurds want, he said, is "complete decentralization without independence."  PUK politburo executive committee chairman Kosrat Rasul said that if Iraq is truly democratic and federal and Article 58 is implemented fully, Kurds would not demand independence.  KRG Presidency Law ------------------  9.  (C) The new KRG presidency law, passed June 7, notes that the President of the region will represent the citizens of Kurdistan "locally and internationally and coordinate between the federal and regional authorities."  In this regard, Massoud Barzani told DCM that the Kurds were unified on Kirkuk and their relations with Baghdad.  He was traveling to Baghdad June 16 to begin sorting out aspects of the relationship.  10. (U) REO Basrah, REO Hillah, REO Mosul, and REO Kirkuk minimize considered.  Jeffrey

Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 16.  2. (C) SUMMARY: Finance Minister Allawi stressed to Charge and DCM on June 16 his readiness to engage fully in ensuring the success of the upcoming Brussels and AMMAN conferences and the July 10-11 Joint Economic Commission (JEC), and confirmed Prime Minister Ja'afari has agreed to a face saving solution to allow Planning Minister Saleh to maintain the donor coordination lead within the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG).  Article IV discussions with the IMF went very well, according to Allawi, and the IMF will not insist on additional revenue producing measures in 2005 other than oil subsidy cuts.  While there is consensus within the ITG on the need for reform, the timing and extent of subsidy cuts is still being debated.  Given Iraq's budgetary pressures, late payments of bills (e.g., fuel purchases from Turkey) have become a de facto form of cash management.  Skeptical of Syrian Finance Minister Hussein's ability to resolve a "political issue," Allawi indicated he would nonetheless telephone Hussein on asset recovery.  Allawi acknowledges the security implications, but is opposed to a renewal of the Global security contract for the Baghdad International Airport.  MoF is prepared to accept a Terrorist Finance/Anti-Money Laundering assessment team sometime in the late summer/early fall -- action request in para 16.  END SUMMARY.  3. (C) During a wide-ranging discussion at the Embassy on June 16 with the Charge and DCM (also attended by Economic Minister Counselor and Treasury Attache), Minister of Finance Allawi outlined an ambitious agenda facing him over the next several months.  Commenting first on Iraq's political situation, Allawi said he expected the current impasse over the composition of the drafting committee n the constitution to be resolved within the next few days, noting that many problems in Iraq end up being resolved at the last minute. He stressed the constitutional process must go forward and that only insurgents want to see it delayed.  ----------- CONFERENCES -----------  4. (C) Observing that Allawi will be heavily involved in a number of important upcoming events (Brussels Conference, JEC, Amman Donors Conference), the Charge stressed the positive role the conferences can play to further the image of the new Iraq and its accomplishments.  In particular, the Charge highlighted Washington's strong desire to see full participation by relevant Iraqi Ministers in the JEC discussions.  Allawi replied he had already discussed this in a meeting with Prime Minister Ja'afari on June 15. Responding to a question from the Charge, Allawi remarked he had also already raised with the Foreign Ministry the issue of delegation of legal authority to sign agreements.  Allawi said he should have authorization from both the Presidency Council and the Prime Minister in time for the JEC.  Allawi acknowledged the Charge and DCM's comments as to the venue and likely timing of the JEC, indicating that a mid-July JEC would not present a problem.  5. (C) Allawi confirmed Ja'afari agreed on June 15 to a face-saving compromise that would allow Minister of Planning Barham Saleh to retain the lead on donor coordination issues.  Both Saleh and Allawi get along well personally and they will work closely together to present a coherent and unified vision on donor assistance at Brussels, he said.  Allawi added, however, it would likely not be possible to present all details of a new donor coordination mechanism at the Brussels conference.  Allawi took credit for the PM's decision, saying it had been his proposal:  he told the PM that for Iraq to get the most effective use out of donor assistance an "elite" group of government officials directly under the Prime Minister should be established, but given that there is not time to establish and make functional such a group in the tenure of the ITG, it would be better to "leave things as they are," with MOPDC in charge.  ------------------------------------------- ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS; BUDGETARY PRESSURES -------------------------------------------  6. (C) Allawi characterized his recent Article IV discussions with the IMF in Abu Dhabi as very positive.  He expects the IMF to file a good report on Iraq that will note Iraq is generally on the right track towards an SBA.  While cautioning that new expenditures should be linked to revenue flows, the IMF has accepted Iraq's need for a supplemental budget.  With the exception of oil subsidy cuts, according to Allawi, the IMF has agreed other possible revenue generating mechanisms can be postponed until 2006.  7. (C) Allawi observed that Iraq does not yet face a fiscal crisis, but must remain vigilant in its management of the budget. Iraq will face a financing gap, and has only two significant sources of revenue:  oil and donor assistance. The Central Bank of Iraq will also have to be careful to maintain sufficient reserves to defend Iraq's currency. Adding that Iraq is treading a very fine line, Allawi said he hoped to use the need for fiscal restraint as a scare tactic to convince others in the government to agree to cuts in oil subsidies.  He is advocating the price of gasoline be raised to 250 Iraqi Dinars per liter.  Allawi cited by way of comparison an equivalent price of 400 ID for gasoline in Saudi Arabia, but said the Ministry of Oil is nevertheless pushing for a less significant subsidy cut in Iraq.  8. (C) Referring to the decision of the Iraqi Interim Government to return to government payrolls thousands of former state employees as political, Allawi said it would of course have a negative impact on Iraq's budget situation. Pension reform also remains an important budgetary question mark.  While acceleration of assistance disbursements is of course good, according to Allawi, it is not likely to have a significant budgetary effect.  9. (C) In response to a question from the DCM, Allawi said the ITG would be prepared prior to the Brussels Conference to make a policy decision that fuel subsidies should be cut, but would not be ready to issue any kind of administrative implementation instructions in the near future.  Allawi has explained at Cabinet meetings Iraq's only sources of income are oil and donor assistance and that the payment of 35% of the budget as handouts is unsustainable.  While Allawi believes most ministers agree with him, his remarks have so far elicited only silence.  10. (C) Agreeing with the Charge's comments about the importance of efficient and effective budget expenditure mechanisms to avoid delays in critical payments, Allawi said there remains great confusion within the Iraqi bureaucracy as to what constitutes legitimate expenditures within a proper budgetary framework. Many think a decree or promise by a minister constitutes an approved expenditure.  Cash flow is also a real problem, and payments delays sometimes reflect a fundamental lack of sufficient funds available.  Allawi cited the example of the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) that has run up debts because higher fuel prices have increased the cost of its monthly purchases abroad from its budgeted $200 million to $250 million.  Bill payment delays have become a de facto form of "crude" cash management for Iraq.  -------------- ASSET RECOVERY --------------  11. (C) Allawi accepted the DCM's recommendation he telephone Syrian Finance Minister Hussein later in the day to discuss recovery of Iraqi assets, but commented the issue is primarily a political one over which Hussein has little control.  He acknowledged the DCM's comments that Syria should not be given the opportunity to try to claim Iraq appears unwilling to engage on the topic.  Allawi also observed that a number of countries still hold significant amounts of frozen Iraqi assets, including the United Kingdom ($250 million), Bahrain ($150 million), and Jordan ($450 million).  With regard to Lebanon, Allawi recently discussed by phone claims against Iraqi assets in Lebanese commercial banks with the chairman of a new Lebanese committee tasked with looking into the issue, adding that the chairman Ghassan Bulbol happens to be his daughter's father-in-law.  12. (C) Allawi agreed with Emincoun's comment that the Brussels Conference represented an opportunity to leverage asset recovery issues.  Allawi also indicated Iraq intends to ask the UN for a five-year moratorium on reparations payments, a measure that could give Iraq an additional $1 billion in budget flexibility.  -------------------------------------- GLOBAL'S CONTRACT FOR SECURITY AT BIAP -------------------------------------- 13. (C) Treasury Attache noted ongoing negotiations between the Ministry of Transportation and the private security firm Global (note: Global provides security at the Baghdad International Airport, has not been paid since March, and has been operating without a contract since the beginning of the year).  Both the Charge and DCM also stressed the critical importance of reaching a settlement between the two parties so that adequate security coverage at the airport can continue.  Otherwise, BIAP civilian operations would likely have to be shut down.  14. (C) Allawi, who complained of having recently been treated with disrespect by Global personnel while going through BIAP, replied that foreign security firms do not have a good reputation with the Iraqi people. While Allawi accepts the argument that security must be maintained, he made clear that he does not like Global trying to hold the security of Iraq hostage to its commercial dispute with the Ministry of Transportation.  Allawi dismissed any closing down of the civilian side of BIAP as mostly inconveniencing government officials departing for foreign trips and seemed willing to accept a temporary cessation in civilian operations if needed.   Allawi will pass along the USG's concerns, but will recommend to the Prime Minister that a new contract for Global not be considered.  -------------------- TF TRAINING; UN DUES --------------------  15. (C) Allawi accepted Emincouns offer to have a U.S. team visit Baghdad sometime in the late summer/early fall to conduct an assessment of what kind of training would be most applicable to assist MoF and CBI on terrorist finance and anti-money laundering.  While he was not aware of issues related to the payment of Iraqi dues to the United Nations, Allawi said he would look into it and consult with the Ministry of Finance.  16. (U) ACTION REQUEST: Please propose dates for an assessment team visit on on terrorist finance and anti-money laundering training.  17. (U) REO Hillah, REO Basra, REO Kirkuk, and REO Mosul minimize considered. Jeffrey 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002593  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/31/2015 TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EFIN, ENRG, EPET, IZ, MASS, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, Security, Energy Sector, Parliament SUBJECT: IRAQ INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY:  MOD PLAN NOT APPROVED BY NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL  REF: BAGHDAD 2517 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR ANNE DERSE FOR REASONS 1.4 B   AND D.  1. (C) SUMMARY: On June 16 Iraq's National Energy Committee (NEC) sent the Iraqi Army back to the drawing boards on its proposed infrastructure security plan, stating that the plan presented was too costly and inconsistent with guidance the NEC has provided in its recent meetings.  The NEC remains concerned with oil pipeline security.  DPM Ahmed Chalabi instructed the Commander of the Army to immediately develop an effective security plan for the northern pipelines using Iraqi military forces that had already been trained.  The Minister of Electricity (ME) was praised by all the Ministers present for the increased availability of electricity across the country. ME used the opportunity to ask for an additional $50 million for spare parts for repairing the energy grid and fixing generation capacity.  The Deputy Minister of Oil (MOO) asked if he could change banks for MOO lines of credit. The DPM asked what this financial action was, and the Deputy MOO answered they were using oil production as collateral for the loans.  The amount owed or the line of credit amounts were not disclosed in the discussions at the table. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) DPM Ahmed Chalabi convened the 6th meeting of the ITG National Energy Committee on Jun 16.  The Ministers of Electricity (ME), Water Resources (MWR), Finance (MOF), Industry and Minerals, and Deputy Minister of Oil (MOO) were present as well as the MOD Director General of Programs and Budget, and the Commander of the Iraqi Army. The Charge', EMINCOUNS, and IRMO Acting Director MG Heine attended.  The meeting was held to review the proposed plan of the Ministry of Defense to defend the northern Iraqi oil pipelines.  --------------------------------------------- -------- ARMY COMMANDER BRIEFED INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION PLAN --------------------------------------------- --------  3.  (C) The Commander of the Army provided the briefing to the NEC on the proposed infrastructure protection plan.  The plan proposed using the untrained, and in some cases unformed, Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIBs) at an initial cost of $70 Million for four battalions, which would not be ready for six months. The DPM said he was dissatisfied with the plan, severely chastising the Commander of the Army for not following the prior instructions of the NEC.  He then publicly apologized to the Commander for his use of public criticism in front of the other Ministers.  He told the Commander of the Army that he was to come back on Monday, Jun 20, with a new plan using Iraqi Army trained forces to guard the pipelines and other critical infrastructure at a cost of $35 million, which has been identified for this purpose.  The DPM said the Iraqi Government had spent a lot of money raising and training the Iraqi Army, and he now he wanted it employed to provide infrastructure protection.  4.  (C) The Ministers present concurred, saying the Strategic Infrastructure Battalions are ineffective and there was an immediate need for trained Iraqi forces.  The pipelines need to be protected now, not in six months or later.  The oil export pipeline from Kirkuk to Bayji, then north toward Turkey was to be the priority for planning and protection as directed by the NEC.  --------------------------------- INCREASED ELECTRICITY ACROSS IRAQ ---------------------------------  5.  (SBU) The Minister of Electricity (ME) said he was glad to report that the rates for the generation of electricity across Iraq had crossed the 5000 MW threshold, and the ME was now generating 5100 MW of sustained power, and he expected to report 6000 MW by the end of the summer.  He was immediately praised by the DPM and his fellow Ministers for this positive result, and the DPM asked him when he could meet the demand of 8000 MW.  The ME responded that if the ITG would "give me enough money I will produce twice that much electricity." The ME then used this opportunity to ask for $50-Million for repair parts and spares for repairing the energy grid and fixing generation capacity across Iraq. The DPM told him they could discuss those funds later, and commended him once again for his effective running of the ME.  --------------------------------------------- ---------- MOO REPORTS DESIRE TO CHANGE THEIR BANK LINES OF CREDIT --------------------------------------------- ----------  6.  (C) The Deputy Minister of Oil asked the DPM if they could change their financed lines of credit from Morgan Stanley Bank to Citibank because Citibank would give them a three year line of credit compared to the 12-18 months with Morgan Stanley.  The DPM was upset over the revelation that MOO was active in the international financial markets outside the appropriate channels in the Iraqi Government.  The DPM asked them how they did this, and the Deputy MOO answered they were using oil production as collateral for the loans. The DPM said this needed to be discussed further in a different forum.  The amount owed or the line of credit amounts were not disclosed in the discussions at the table.  --------------------------------------------- ------- AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING OF NATIONAL ENERGY COMMITTEE --------------------------------------------- -------  7.  (C) The DPM said the Monday, June 20 meeting of the NEC would review the new plan by the Ministry of Defense for defense of the northern Iraqi pipelines.   ------- COMMENT -------  8.  (C) COMMENT:  DPM Chalabi dominated this meeting of the NEC, as he has previous meetings.  The NEC meeting illustrated the continuing dispute between NEC and MOD over how to defend the pipelines.  The NEC wants immediate protection of the critical northern export pipeline and does not want to spend a large amount of funds in addition to those already provided to MOD to build the Iraqi security forces. The MOD seeks additional funding and is willing to wait six or more months to provide protection for critical infrastructure.  The revelation that the MOO was engaging in financial arrangements with international banks appeared to come as surprise to the DPM, and he appeared concerned over the impact this might have on other financial arrangements for the government of Iraq.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on June. 19 were Al-Jafari's visit to Kuwait, military operations in Al-Qa'im and Al-Thar Thar, and the Brussels conference. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Failure is not an option in Iraq" (Asharq Al-Awsat, 6/19) B. "Human rights are an important theme in drafting the constitution" (Al-Ittihad, 6/19)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Failure is not an option in Iraq" (Asharq Al-Awsat, 6/19)  Asharq Al-Awsat (independent, London-based, has wide circulation in Iraq) published a ninth-page editorial by Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid about the situation in Iraq:  "American Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, a man of Afghan origin who was moved from Kabul to Baghdad, has recently stated that failure in Iraq is not an option. However, neither he nor his superiors in Washington have explained the meaning of failure. Because of the continued loss of human lives, there have been some doubts about whether the U.S. forces will continue to remain in Iraq. The continued deterioration of the security situation has led some U.S. congressional members to demand a timetable for the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq.  Not only is failure in Iraq possible, it is imminent. The question that remains is what will be the magnitude of the American loss? Will it be the loss of 2,000 soldiers in just two years? What will happen if this number reaches ten or even thirty thousand? What will happen if the number of attacks increases and new groups join the insurgency? What will happen if the Iraqi people continue to disagree with each other, thus proving that the country cannot be stabilized? Historical experiments have demonstrated that anything is possible in the Middle East, including failure. If the U.S. departs Iraq defeated, it will likely lose its dominance in the world and perhaps lose its presence in other countries. The U.S. will become just like any other small country that can be defeated easily. Indeed, the American position in the world will be weak and Washington will lose the trust of its friends.  The new American Ambassador stated that failure in Iraq is not an option. Yet, we must declare that achieving success is not so easy. During the Vietnam War, Washington repeated that it would not leave the country until South Vietnam won the war. However, the U.S. left Vietnm afer he communists took control of Saigon. At that time, the Americans were trying to catch the last fleeing helicopters from the roof of the Embassy. If you were to ask Henry Kissinger about that terrible defeat, he would say that the Americans lost Vietnam but stopped the Left from controlling all of Southeast Asia. Nonetheless, the cost of failure in Iraq is higher than in Vietnam because Iraq's oil is much more important than Vietnam's rice.  The U.S. defeat in Iraq will be the end of an empire. Most Iraqi politicians, except for those of the Muslim Scholars Association, realize that the early withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq will threaten the internal situation and may push the country into civil war. This war will be terrible and similar to the Serbian war on Bosnia and Kosovo. A decade ago in the Balkans, the world asked for American intervention to stop the ugly massacres that were occurring. From that time until now, the situation in the Balkans has been under control. The Iraqi people deserve a chance to enjoy stability and they deserve to run their own internal affairs, without the need for American troops. This must be an Iraqi decision, not one made by the Arabs who are living away from the fire."  B. "Human rights are an important theme in drafting the constitution" (Al-Ittihad, 6/19)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a third-page editorial by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about the constitution:  "On April 9th, 2003, many voices appeared from the cracks that began calling for human rights. In the past, it was forbidden to speak about this issue because it did not conform with the policies of the former regime. Thus, any discussion on human rights was artificial and far from its real meaning. For decades, human rights were violated in all Iraqi cities. Today, there are many associations and organizations that have expressed their interest in human rights. However, the concept of human rights is not as easy as some people may think. In reality, these concepts are extensive and include aspects of several different fields that must be discussed in order to obtain a full understanding of human rights. The leaders and members of these organizations must be highly educated so that they can overcome obstacles that may hinder them in accomplishing their goal of establishing effective human rights organizations. Iraq is full of reliable human rights activists that have dedicated their lives to promoting the rights of the Iraqi people. The constitutional committee has recently begun to draft the permanent constitution. Undoubtedly, human rights will be an important theme for the constitution drafting process because it is now time to correct the violations that have plagued the past.  The constitution is the primary law of the country and it must guarantee all rights. We must disseminate the culture of human rights in order to understand its concepts. This can be accomplished by providing specialized staffs in human rights to teach the subject in universities and other academic arenas. We should take the subject of human rights and turn it into an academic curriculum. In addition, we must hold human rights forums for governmental employees in all provinces. We must encourage civil society organizations to participate in these forums and conduct media campaigns to educate the Iraqi people about human rights because they must be accompanied by commitments."

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (  b) and (d)  1. (C) Two Sunni Arab leaders told Poloff June 19 that they would need one more day to reach agreement on their nominees for the TNA Constitution Drafting Committee.  Iraqi Islamic Party leader Naseer al-Ani assured Poloff the names of 15 nominees and 10 expert consultants would be put forward by June 20.  Sunni Shaykh Anwar al-Nada separately told Poloff that he was confident that the issue would be settled in a June 20 meeting between all Sunni leaders who have participated in the dialogue so far.  2. (C) Shaykh Anwar told Poloff that the real reason for the delay is ongoing maneuvering between political parties vying for more space on the committee.  He said he particularly resented the fact that three of the five members of the naming committee had nominated themselves for the committee, a move that called into question their objectivity.  Al-Ani, a member of the five-member committee assigned to pick the names, was still sensitive over the concession that Sunni Arab leaders made by accepting 15 additional members and 10 expert consultants.  "We need more time because we are trying to represent all the different trends of the Sunni community, and that is difficult to do with only 15 names," he said.  3. (C) COMMENT:  We expected some last minute theatrics from the fractious Sunni Arab community; it would be surprising if there were none. The Sunni leadership, such as it is, is still smarting from what they perceive to be a big concession in accepting 15 representatives.  Getting over that compromise and finalizing a unified list has apparently been too much for one weekend's work.  We are in continuous contact with our key Sunni and Shia interlocutors to urge as strongly as possible - invoking senior level USG interest - that the issue of names be resolved asap, in order to move forward on drafting the proposed constitution.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002606  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, IZ, National Assembly, Shia Islamists, Sunni Arab SUBJECT: VICE PRESIDENT ABDEL MEHDI PONDERS THE CONSTITUTION AND HOW TO GIVE SHIA WHAT THE KURDS NOW HAVE  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford for 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY. During a June 18 farewell luncheon with Charge Jeffrey, Vice President Adil Abdel Mahdi noted that 13 of the 15 Sunni additional members to the Constitutional Committee had been decided upon. Abdel Mehdi opined that public ignorance among his Shia constituency about federalism could be a potential problem.  Mehdi said the public must be educated about the constitution.   He said there is some grumbling about the power and autonomy of Kurdistan, but suggested that other Iraqi provinces should form their own regions and achieve the same degree of authority and responsibilities that the Kurds now enjoy.  Discussions are ongoing about uniting nine southern provinces into one region, he stated.  Charge Jeffrey urged the Vice President to counsel the Shia to be flexible in accepting proposed Sunni Arab names for the constitution committee.  He said it would be important to delineate at the authorities of the provincial and regional governments as distinct from the national government in the new constitution.  He cautioned that setting up a large Shia regional government in advance of the approval of the constitution might complicate issues in Iraq. Mehdi speculated that the future Government would have a unicameral parliament elected from local constituencies that would in turn choose the prime minister while the presidency would be a ceremonial post mainly.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------- LOOKING AHEAD:  FEDERALISM DEBATE ---------------------------------  2.  (C) Vice President Adil Abdel Mehdi discussed the constitution during a June 18 farewell luncheon with Charge Jeffrey, saying the federalism discussion would be difficult because of a lack of understanding of this concept.  Most of the debate is amongst the Shia Coalition, said Abdel Mehdi, not amongst the Kurds. While Iraqis accept the general principle of federalism, he predicted that the discussions about its implementation could be heated.  --------------------------------------- GIVING SHIA WHAT THE KURDS ALREADY HAVE ---------------------------------------  3.  (C) Abdel Mehdi mused that even if the Shia Coalition did not agree with the scope of local authority the Kurdish Regional Government has acquired, the Shia can do nothing about it.  In the end, he concluded, the Kurds were only taking what should be theirs by right.  He cautioned, however, that many in the Shia community do not agree; there is a sense that the Kurds have gone too far.  Abdel Mehdi said that, in a recent meeting of leaders of the southern provinces, there was grumbling that the current situation is unsupportable -- that it is impossible to have one region with all the authority and other provinces with none at all.  Abdel Mehdi stated that it would be impossible for the Kurds to have one set of authorities in their region and the Shia provinces to live with another.  The Kurds' authorities could not be reduced.  Thus, the authorities that the Shia locales have must be increased to match those of the Kurds.  He also agreed it is important to delineate which assets and responsibilities belong to the provinces and which belong at the national level.  ----------------------------- SHIA MEGA-REGIONAL GOVERNMENT? -----------------------------  4.  (C) Abdel Mehdi said there is a discussion underway about uniting the nine southern, Shia provinces to form a single region.  The Sunnis might see the creation of a single southern region as a stepping-stone to the region's annexation by Iran, but Abdel Mehdi argued that such a larger regional entity within Iraq would have enough weight to create a strong national identity, prevent fragmentation, and counter the current 'local' orientation that is so pervasive.  He recognized the problem that the Sunnis would quickly try to form their own multi-province region, raising tensions in Ninewa (which they share mainly with the Kurds) and Diyala (shared by Sunnis, Shia and Kurds).  The Sunnis could be sure only of Anbar and Salah ad Din provinces, and these are, Abdel Mehdi admitted, resource poor.  (NOTE:  In a later meeting, Vice President Ghazi al-Yawar told Charge Jeffrey that the unification of these nine southern provinces into a single region would be a catastrophe. However, he suggested that moving the Shia towards a grouping of nine provinces into three regional governments would be acceptable.  END NOTE.)  ------------------------ PUBLIC EDUCATION: URGENT ------------------------  5.  (C) Abdel Mehdi emphasized the need to educate the public, in language that it understands, about constitutional issues and expressed concern that there is inadequate time for public outreach -- especially if the Constitutional Committee takes several more weeks before beginning its work.  He welcomed word of the resources available through USG funding to help with public outreach.  --------------------------------- BRINGING SUNNI ARABS INTO PROCESS ---------------------------------  6.  (C) Abdel Mehdi briefly discussed the 15 Sunnis to be included on the Constitutional Committee, noting that 13 of the 15 had been decided upon.  He stressed that it would be important for the Sunni selection committee to avoid choices that would excessively anger the Shia public.  "We have to be able to defend their choices with our own people," Abdel Mehdi cautioned.  He acknowledged that the political views of those selected would likely be less important than their personal histories.  7.  (C) Charge Jeffrey emphasized the need to focus on the constitution and use that framework for determining how to form a regional structure.  He discouraged Abdel Mehdi from promoting the idea of establishing a single Shia regional government prior to the adoption of the constitution and national elections.  He also cautioned that natural resources, especially oil revenues, likely would need to remain under the national government's authority lest they provoke struggles for territory.  Charge Jeffrey also urged Abdel Mehdi to counsel flexibility among the Shia as they review the final list of Sunni Arabs proposed for the constitution committee.  ---------------------------------------- SHAPE OF FUTURE GOVERNMENT - SPECULATION ----------------------------------------  8.  (C) Abdel Mehdi said he envisions the future government to be one that is parliamentary in nature and unicameral.  It likely would be elected on the basis of provincial or local districts.  The parliament should choose the prime minister, he opined.  He agreed with our observation that such a system would give political parties more influence. He added that Iraq likely would have a ceremonial president whose authorities would be limited.  9.  (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.   Satterfield

BAGHDAD 2554 (NOTAL)      B. PARIS 4039 (NOTAL)  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a), (d) and (g)  1. (C) REFTEL A registers our skepticism concerning the security argument underlying French Ambassador to Iraq Bajolet's request for DoD cardholders' slightly expedited access to Baghdad International Airport (BIAP).  We would be loathe to issue such cards, or similarly effective senior-grade MNF-I badges, to the French, based on their weak security argument, as it could be seized upon by the Chinese, Iranian and Russian Embassies, for example, to justify requests for the same privilege.  DoD identification cards and senior-grade MNF-I badges grant access to most of the International Zone and, if other checks fail, to the critical Coalition military facility adjacent to BIAP; in the wrong hands, an unacceptable security risk.  2. (C) We are, however, eager to enhance NATO allies' embassies the ability to support the Alliance's contribution to Iraq's reconstruction, which, with the autumn opening of the Rustimayah training facility, should expand considerably.  On that basis alone, we plan, starting July 5, to offer a more senior-grade MNF-I badge to diplomatic and attache staff of NATO embassies.  From that date, subject to standard security checks, we will issue senior-grade MNF-I badges to staff of NATO embassies, who are citizens of that country. We will not, however, grant senior-grade MNF-I badges to local or third-country national employees of those embassies.  By our reckoning, we will be extending senior-grade badge privileges to the non-Coalition Alliance embassies of Canada, France, Germany, Greece and Portugal.  3. (C) A collateral benefit for the recipient embassies will be the right to enter BIAP through the "Coalition Lane," the longstanding request of the French ambassador.  Again, to forestall requests for senior-grade badges from, for example, Iranian diplomats, we will deny any suggestion that the current VVIP lane access to BIAP imposes an unacceptable security risk on non-Coalition diplomats.  We will also note to the French and others that the presence in a diplomatic car of non-badged Iraqi drivers, TDYers from capitals or recently ransomed hostages will result in the slight inconvenience of the vehicle's diversion into the VVIP lane.  4.

Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a step promoting more political engagement by large segments of Anbar, 200 religious, tribal, political and academic leaders from around Fallujah on June 4 hammered out a fifteen-point document outlining a more participatory Sunni posture in the political process.  Beyond the standard demand for a Coalition Forces withdrawal, the declaration condemns attacks against Iraqi civilians (not Coalition Forces) and urges participation in drafting of the constitution.  A follow-on meeting is tentatively set for July in Fallujah with over 300 area participants expected.  Internal dialogue about national political issues will remain the primary focus of future gatherings, according to organizers. They also flagged that similar meetings might be held in Ramadi and Al-Qa'im in coming weeks.  A similar gathering of tribal leaders in Ramadi was scheduled for June 15 but was postponed due to insurgent intimidation in the city in advance of the session. These meetings and efforts to organize them do not mean that Anbaris won't boycott future elections, but they do suggest that Anbaris are more willing to engage in politics after the bitter January 2005 election experience.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------- SUNNI GRASS ROOTS POLITICS? ---------------------------  2.  (C) According to one of the principal organizers, Engineer Fawzi Mohammed (local business leader and manager of a large Fallujah cement factory -- site of the meeting), the gathering of 200 area leaders mainly focused on the upcoming referendum and follow-on election.  While a stated goal remained the withdrawal of Coalition Forces (and other now standard objections or complaints), increased Sunni political participation represented the primary impetus for the self-initiated meeting.  Participants for the meeting included the full spectrum of local leaders from the tribes, clerics, business community and ex-military. (COMMENT:  This gathering marks the first time that such a large group of Fallujans have met independently -- and at the grass roots level -- to discuss national political issues.  Until now, most area caucuses have been almost exclusively geared toward Fallujah reconstruction specifics (water, power, sewer lines) or local political issues (compensation payments, etc). END COMMENT.)  --------------------------------------------- - FALLUJAH SHOULD NOT BE HAND THAT DESTROYS IRAQ --------------------------------------------- -  3.  (C) Fawzi acknowledged to Fallujah PolOff privately that "you know what happened in the last election" - adding that Sunnis did not want to repeat the mistake of failing to vote.  He continued that Iraq should not be "stung by bombings; we want Iraq to be stable."  Fawzi conveyed that when he went on trips to Baghdad, his family phoned him a dozen times each visit, to check on his safety.  He did not want this situation to continue.  (COMMENT:  In December 2004 and January 2005, Fawzi used to reiterate to PolOff familiar Sunni arguments critical of the national political process and the need for election delay.  He did the same in a January 2005 session, pre-election, with Senator John Kerry at Camp Fallujah.  END COMMENT.)  4.  (C) Fallujah, according to Fawzi, had suffered too much - and, as a city leader, he did not want Fallujah to "destroy the union of Iraq."  He said that the city cannot be the "the hand that does that."  Most wanted the situation to return back to normal.  The meeting was intended to help pull some insurgents into this larger group.  As for the next election, Fawzi declared it was more a matter of Sunnis having to vote, rather than wanting to vote.  5.  (C) In a separate discussion, Fallujah reconstruction committee coordinator Basil Mahmoud (who supplied Fallujah Poloff with a copy of the consensus document) confirmed Fawzi's characterization of the meeting.  Basil noted that he had stayed in the back of the room throughout the two-hour session; the heated discussion had been wide ranging and included elements who opposed all aspects of the Coalition presence in Iraq. (NOTE:  Basil did not categorize these participants as "insurgents" but implied as much. END NOTE).  He added that Fawzi had brought together "not all the good people, but all the right people."  More meetings needed to be held; a follow-on gathering in Fallujah proper was set for July.  Basil said coalition forces would likely be asked to help provide security, given that 300 plus participants might attend.  --------------------------------------------- - CONSENSUS DOCUMENT: SOME NEW POINTS AMID USUAL COMPLAINTS --------------------------------------------- -  6.  (C) The cement factory meeting resulted in a consensus document (full text, paragraph 14), listing 15 key points.  Noteworthy in the list are the following:  --Condemnation of "all criminal activities against citizens and innocent Iraqi people.  Any such action will be considered an act of terrorism." (number 3)  --Reforming a national committee to write the constitution that should include all the people's rights now and in the future. (number 8)  --Reforming the Iraqi Army with new technological and modern methods to be a strong army using the experience of ex-Iraqi officers.  (number 9) (NOTE: Fallujah is home to a number of former military officers, many of whom served in key Iraqi army positions.  They have established their own association in the city.  END NOTE).  --Asking all neighboring countries not to interfere with Iraqi internal issues.  (number 12)  --Allowing the people to participate in political actions and the writing of the constitution.  (number 13)  --Ensuring that Iraq will be one nation that will stand against anybody trying to separate it.  This will be considered the red line that nobody should pass under any circumstance. (number 14)   7.  (C) Other points reflect usual demands or complaints, such as:  specific timetable for Coalition Force withdrawal from Iraq; release of detainees; canceling the de-Ba'athification law; and formation of Fallujah security forces from city recruits.  One additional request stands out:  post-invasion compensation for damages "from all the countries that participated in the war in Iraq on unproven allegations, such as weapons of mass destruction." The group proposed that a United Nations body be established as was done in Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to oversee compensation payments. (COMMENT:  The text drafters are unlikely to consider billions in appropriated U.S. reconstruction funds equivalent to war reparations.  END COMMENT).  --------------------- A GATHERING OF TRIBES ---------------------  8.  (C) Several area tribal leaders (Sheikh Abdulwahed Hamed Khalel al Janabi, Hameed Farhan Abdullah Mohamdi al Hamda, Ahmad Sarhan Abed Mashan, Kamel Mohammed Saif) told poloff June 11 that the meeting's objectives were political in nature.  When asked if local residents were intending to take part in the referendum and vote, even at this early stage, a half dozen nodded and raised hands expressing they would. (NOTE: This weekly meeting with so-called "street sheikhs" at the Fallujah Civil Military Operations Center incluesabout a dozen local tribal leaders, who in effect are the closest to the Fallujah-area people; the most senior tribal leaders sit on the new city council.  END NOTE).  9.  (C) At a June 14, 2005, Fallujah city council session, Sheikh Khamis Hisnawe Aifan al-Esawe (al- Buessa tribe) -- considered by many residents to be Fallujah's most influential and senior tribal leader - - made a notable, and uncharacteristic, public statement.  He informed everyone gathered that he would convene all area tribes in nearby Amiriyah, a community where "five or six dead bodies" were being found daily.  The purpose of the gathering would be to address security issues.  Khamis said the harassment needed to stop, as "these are our brothers." Coalition Forces and police should not be present, in order to avoid problems.  Khamis added that the meeting would be held at the Amiriyah mosque, lists with names would be brought by tribes to "identify crooks and robbers." (NOTE: Initial reports indicate that the meeting was well attended.  END NOTE)  ------------ RAMADI, TOO? ------------  10.  (C) Fawzi told PolOff June 7 that some Sunni leaders in Ramadi were considering forming their own political group, like the one in neighboring Fallujah.  He did not offer details but noted that political interest among Sunnis had noticeably increased.  Al Qa'im residents might do the same. According to a separate Marine intelligence report, an Iraqi source claims Ramadi leaders intend to hold this kind of meeting June 16.  Marines in Ramadi confirmed at a June 15 meeting at the provincial government center that the political gathering would be held.  Anbar Governor Ma'moun told Marines that he was notified by organizers about the event, but believed he was not extended an invitation.  He added "an uninvited guest at a banquet sits in no chair."  The Governor stressed that that the official voice of Al Anbar would remain through the Provincial Council and his office.  (NOTE:  The June 16 gathering in Ramadi was postponed; insurgents effectively intimidated potential participants from attending the meeting. END NOTE)  ------- COMMENT -------  11.  (C) While these political and security initiatives by Fallujah and other area leaders remain in the initial stages, they mark a surprising shift. Organizing to such a degree at the local level will need to be sustained in coming weeks.  A return to status quo Sunni indifference is possible, but unlikely if locals follow-up on these early initiatives.  They could spread to other parts of Anbar.  12.  (C) Engineer Fawzi Mohammed and Sheikh Khamis are representative of two key Sunni constituencies central to reversing insurgent intimidation and fostering political participation:  the former is a major Anbar business leader and ex-Ba'athist; the latter a senior tribal sheikh.  Both have considerable "wasta" (influence) in the community.  If they are getting off the proverbial fence, others should follow.  13.  (C) These meetings will not ensure high Sunni turnout for the referendum or on election day; taken together, however, they could be the basis for sustained political dialogue and voter education that equals sizeable turnout.  In December 2004 and January 2005, Fallujah-area Sunnis fell largely silent on overarching political matters; today, there is at least the beginning of self-initiated and frank discourse, including about the costs of non- participation.  The 15-point consensus document produced at the Fallujah meeting reveals -- for now -- this more balanced, and pragmatic, Sunni mindset at the grass-roots level.  14.  (U) The consensus document agreed at June 4, 2005, meeting of Fallujah-area leaders is translated as follows.  BEGIN TEXT:  FINAL REPORT The national political gathering in Fallujah held its initial meeting on June 4, 2005. The meeting included different groups from religious leaders, tribe leaders, political and education leaders.  The committee had a heated discussion about the future of Iraq regarding internal and international relationships. This will help avoid all kinds of discrimination and tribal differences. Fallujah will have one democratic group. This has been done through a democratic discussion between different people from Iraq. We will form a national team that will be working day and night to rebuild a democratic Iraq. This team will also help the citizens of Iraq to participate in all political actions and decisions including the right to vote. We will not have a separated Iraq anymore. The committee also discussed all the issues that face Iraq at the present time. The committee agreed on some issues, to include politics and the constitution.  The points that the committee agreed on are:  -Setting a specific schedule for the occupational forces to withdraw from Iraq. -Accepting a peaceful and a national force that follows all international laws. -Condemning all criminal activities against citizens and innocent Iraqi people. Any such action will be considered an act of terrorism. -Asking the occupational forces and the interim Iraqi government to release all political detainees. They will also stop raiding houses and mosques. -To disband all illegal political parties in Iraq. -Asking that the interim government to work on canceling all the Iraqi debt, as well as compensations that have been put on Iraq by unjust international decisions. -Canceling Albaath law, and consider it as a legal not political issue. -Reforming a national committee to write the constitution that should include all the people's rights now and in the future. -Reforming the Iraqi army on new technological and modern methods to be a strong army using the experience from ex-loyal Iraqi officers. -Calling for the withdrawal of the occupational forces from Fallujah; and forming an Iraqi police and an army from the people of Fallujah itself to do their duty in keeping peace. -Allowing all Middle Eastern and foreign mass media to get in Fallujah to send to the world a picture of what really happened. -Asking all neighboring countries not to interfere with the Iraqi internal issues. -Allowing the people to participate in political actions and the writing of the constitution. -The committee will ensure that Iraq will be one nation that will stand against anybody trying to separate it. This will be considered the red line that nobody should pass under any circumstances. -The committee will ask for compensation from all the countries that participated on the war in Iraq on unproven allegations; such as weapons of mass destruction. This compensation will be given to a committee that the United Nations will establish as they did in Kuwait. Any Iraqi, company, or government institution has the right to turn in their claims to get their compensation.  Finally, the committee's door is open for any efforts that will help the abovementioned points.  END TEXT.   Satterfield 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002616  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  STATE FOR NEA/I, NEA/PPD, DRL, S/TT, PA, AND R DOD AND NSC FOR PA EMBASSIES / CONSULATES FOR PAO  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: KPAO, PREL, SCUL, Media SUBJECT:  THE REMAKING OF "AL-IRAQIYYA" - PRIMITIVE BUT EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING  REF:  Baghdad 00928  Entire text sensitive but unclassified - please handle accordingly.  1.  Summary:  After almost two years of confusion, several hundred million dollars in investment, chaotic management, and Byzantine internal machinations, "Al-Iraqiyya" -- the television component of the Iraqi Media Network (IMN) -- shows signs of finding its voice and projecting a populist "Iraqi" message, even as technical capabilities deteriorate. The network has gained credibility and impact (and audience share; it is now the leading broadcaster in the country) through its perceived "Iraqi-ization" following the April completion of a support contract by the U.S.-based Harris Corporation.  Nonetheless, it continues to face serious hurdles in management, personnel training, and program production.  The Embassy is supporting efforts within the ITG to enhance Al-Iraqiyya's long-term viability and capability by addressing structural and legal shortcomings with the IMN Board of Governors, and is engaging -- largely through USAID resources -- on selected program, training, and other areas of support.  End Summary.  ------------ ON THEIR OWN ------------  2.  By all accounts, "Al-Iraqiyya" continues to suffer severe administrative problems, and on a regular basis disgruntled Iraqi employees engage American interlocutors seeking assistance and "intervention."  There are serious questions about the capabilities and "agenda" of Director General Habib Al-Sadr (related by marriage to SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz Hakim), as well as concerns about the "autonomy" of the (supposedly independent) Board of Governors.  Like many Iraqi institutions, financial resources, training opportunities, and authority are centralized, and regional affiliates are often left to fend for themselves.  3.  Nonetheless, since the completion of the Harris contract just over two months ago, an element of resentment which had existed on the part of some towards what was considered outside influence has disappeared.  Funded now entirely by Iraqi Government funds -- and by all indications none too generously -- the station's image has changed from one with high production values but considerable foreign programming (Lebanese soap operas and game shows, American documentaries, etc.) to an "Iraqi" broadcaster -- warts and all.  The emphasis is now on inexpensive, local programming -- "talking head" public policy programs, "reality TV," and the like.  4.  Unlike its main rival -- the upscale broadcaster "Al- Sharqiyya," which appeals to a more cosmopolitan viewer -- "Al-Iraqiyya" carries programming that ranges from the pedestrian (live sessions of the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly), to the provocative (such as its most popular program, "Terrorists in te Hnds of Justice," which puts alleged malefactors on camera for a grilling by an off- camera Iraqi security officer; see reftel).  The common denominator is Iraq-centrism.  "Al-Iraqiyya" also carries a prime time weekly economic reform talk show (funded by PA Baghdad, through a local NGO) called "Iqtisaduna," and a wide spectrum of inexpensive, "man-in-the-street," phone-in and talk shows.  Graphic, patriotic spots with up-tempo music promoting the Iraqi security forces, ads calling on citizens to report terrorists' activities, explanations of the electricity shortage, and the promotion of Iraqi democracy are ubiquitous.  "Al-Iraqiyya's" frequent paid public service announcements promoting Iraqi confidence and pride -- produced by outside organizations -- are the broadcasters most professional programming.  ---------------------------- MEN OF THE WOLF LEAD THE WAY ----------------------------  5.  One of the most effective local spots is a music video produced by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) which precedes the top rated "Terrorists" show.  Set to traditional Iraqi tribal music and called "Men of the Wolf" (MoI's Wolf Brigade produces the "Terrorists" program), it juxtaposes Iraqi troops training, shooting, dancing, praying -- a red-tabbed Iraqi general gently opens and kisses a Qur'an -- with the destruction caused by terrorists, included damaged mosques and churches, burning oil pipes and wounded women and children.  It is quite an effective piece of agitprop.  6.  In addition to consistently carrying TNA sessions and press conferences by Iraqi officials, the station churns out locally-produced music videos praising Iraq and its security forces.  On Friday, viewers are treated to both ends of the new Iraq's socio-ideological spectrum: in the morning a religious program offers a unique form of "Sunni outreach," with a call-in show featuring four anti-insurgency but very conservative salafi Sunni Arab shaykhs, while in the afternoon the program "Hawazir" features an attractive Iraqi woman conducting random interviews in markets, street corners and shops; she approaches total strangers (mostly men), makes small talk with them, and asks them a question which, if they answer correctly, allows them to select a prize.  ----------------------------- STILL A DIFFICULT WAY FORWARD -----------------------------  7.  All recent polling and anecdotal evidence continues to show "Al-Iraqiyya" as, currently, the most popular station nationwide.  This is no small accomplishment considering that Iraqis now have at least 22 local stations plus -- with a boom in once-forbidden satellite dishes -- a plethora of regional Arab networks to choose from.  The station's production values compare poorly with many of its competitors, but it offers something they do not (or do not wish to): undiluted positive messaging and an image of normalcy and self-confidence for the Iraqi people.  8.  The ITG has been sensitized to the need to bring "Al- Iraqiyya's" Board of Governors to full strength and get the new Board approved by the Transitional National Assembly. Habib Al-Sadr, an Allawi appointee with family ties to SCIRI leader Al-Hakim, is under close scrutiny from sectors within the ITG who would like to see him replaced with a Shi'a Islamist figure (such as Jawad Talib, Prime Minister Ja'afari's media advisor and, prior to 2003, Ja'afari's representative in Tehran).  9.  Comment:  The key to "Al-Iraqiyya's" continued effectiveness and sustainability will be its ability to create an effective and efficient management structure, including addressing serious personnel issues (especially staff training and retention), lack of production capability, and dysfunctional administrative practices. Embassy Baghdad, both PA and USAID, are engaged in an intensive dialogue with the ITG and IMN on how the USG can assist "Al-Iraqiyya" in addressing these urgent needs.  10.  Ultimately, a competitive media environment, such as exists in Iraq, requires excellence for success.  But in the Iraq of today, "Al-Iraqiyya" -- with its simple but targeted messaging and homespun credibility -- is currently enjoying a stay at the top of the competitive media heap.  End Comment.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 002620  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, IZ, National Assembly, Reconstruction SUBJECT: TNA PETITION PROTESTS JAFARI REQUEST FOR MNF-I EXTENSION  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert S. Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C) Summary.  A bloc of 83 TNA legislators presented a petition June 19 protesting the Jafari government's call for an extension of the MNF-I mandate.  Several Sadrist promoting the petition argued that a timeline for withdrawal would reduce the legitimacy of the insurgency.  Many of the petition signatories, however, appeared to be protesting that the TNA was not consulted in the decision, not the MNF-I extension itself.    End Summary.  2.  (C) Leading Sadrist representative Falah Shanshal announced a petition protesting the extension of the MNF-I mandate at the June 19 TNA session.  He pointed out that with 83 signatories and only 130  members of the TNA present at that day's session, the petition represented a bloc with commanding legislative authority.  Our subsequent conversations with TNA members revealed that many signatories were protesting the Jafari government's decision-making process, not the decision itself.  The majority of the signatories appear to be following the first of the following two motivations:  -- OBJECTING TO A VIOLATION OF THE TAL:  Many of the signatories to the petition appear to have been protesting the TNA's exclusion from the decision- making process, not the decision itself.  They pointed to TAL Article 39 (A), which states that the "international treaties and agreements" must pass from the council of ministers to the presidency council before being ratified by the TNA.  (Comment: Embassy legal counsel has concluded that the call for an extension of a UNSCR mandate, as made by FM Zebari, was legal.  TAL Article 39 does not cover a request for the extension of the UNSCR mandate. End Comment)  -- CALLING FOR A TIMELINE:  Some 26 Sadrists who most likely backed the petition appear to have been making a larger political statement.  Shanshal told Poloff that he believed the absence of a withdrawal timeline spreads fears that the MNF-I presence would continue indefinitely.  He said these fears were feeding support for the insurgency.  Shanshal also said he believed a pressing timeline would motivate the U.S. to train Iraqi forces more urgently.  He said he was pushing for a phased withdrawal as Iraqi forces are trained, not an immediate pullout.  Poloff told Shanshal that a timeline for MNF-I withdrawal would actually motivate the insurgency, not demoralize it. Shanshal responded that he heard press reports that several U.S. congressmen shared his position.  ------- Comment -------  3.  (C) This challenge to the MNF-I presence is significant but less alarming than it appears.  Many of the signatories to the petition probably support the MNF-I extension but oppose that the TNA was not consulted.  Those who support legislation for a timeline appear to still be a minority in the TNA. Shia Political Council Member Ali Yoshua, himself a signatory to the petition, urged Poloff not to over- interpret the document.  He said he and others had signed the document to send a warning to Jafari, not the USG.  4.  (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.   Satterfield

C O N F I D E N T I A L  BAGHDAD 002782   E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ SUBJECT: IRAQI OFFICILAS INCLINED TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH TO NEW IRANIAN PRESIDENT  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Summary.  Our Iraqi interlocutors appear to know little about new Iranian President Ahmadinejad and are taking a "wait-and-see" approach to their dealings with him.  Undersecretary Bayati believes the vote for Ahmadinejad was a vote of no confidence against Iran's religious establishment, not a jab at the United States.  Bayati thinks the crucial item to watch is Ahmadinejad's cabinet choices for a signal of his true intent.  Bayati believes most Iranians like Americans and are eager to improve relations with them, and that Ahmadinejad's statements that he sees no need to work with the Americans may be bluff. Interior Minister Bayan Jabr expressed disappointment that Hashemi Rafsanjani lost the election.  The Iraqi leadership, including the Shia Islamists, do not know Ahmadinejad and Jabr thinks that his SCIRI Shia political party should dispatch a delegation quietly to meet the new Iranian President.  Looking over the longer term, MFA Undersecretary Abbawi suggests Ahmadinejad's election could set the stage for political change in Iran if in the end he fails to deliver on his campaign promises.  Kurdish interlocutors are disappointed that a man they perceive to be a hardliner came to power.   Above all, our Shia and Kurdish contacts fear that Ahmadinejad might seek to destabilize the emerging, but shaky, political structure in Iraq.  End Summary.  -------------------- NOT AN ANTI-USA VOTE --------------------  2.  (C) Foreign Ministry Undersecretary for Bilateral Affairs Hamid Al-Bayati (SCIRI) told Poloffs June 29 that he knew little about Iran's new President, the conservative former Tehran major Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To get a sense of where Ahmadinejad is headed, Bayati said one should pay close attention to the composition of his new cabinet.  Bayati did not think that the vote for Ahmadinejad and against Hashemi Rafsanjani was a vote of no confidence against Iran's religious establishment.  Besides not wanting a religious man for their President, Bayati said that Iranians voted against Rafsanjani because he represented an entrenched, and seemingly corrupt, establishment. Even though Ahmadinejad has stated that there is no need for relations with the United States, Biayati opined that most Iranians are pro-American and would like to improve relations with Americans.  3.  (C) Over dinner June 28, Interior Minister Bayan Jabr told PolCouns he was disappointed that Hashemi Rafsanjani had lost the election.  Jabr sighed that the Iraqi leadership, including the Shia Islamists, do not know Ahmadinejad.  As a result, he said, no one can predict what Ahmadinejad will want from its relations with Iraq.  The new president could complicate Iraq's security problems if he chose, Jabr observed, and the result would be doubly bad for Iraqi Shi'a.  Therefore, Jabr concluded, his SCIRI Shia political party should dispatch a delegation quietly to meet the new Iranian President.  PolCouns noted that normally a Foreign Ministry opens such quiet contacts, but Jabr brushed this aside.  First SCIRI could lead with contacts, and if positive, then the Foreign Ministry could follow up, he opined.  ----------------------- SOCIAL CONFLICT COMING? -----------------------  4.  (C) Foreign Ministry Undersecretary for Policy Planning Labeed Abbawi noted in a separate meeting on June 29 that with the Iranian government dominated entirely by conservatives, conditions are set for political change through social conflict.  Iranians now enjoy greater social freedoms -- such as looser dress codes and more mixing between the sexes -- and new government efforts to reign in these freedoms would raise the resentment against the Islamic rule, opined Labeed.  The loser in the Iranian presidential election, Rafsanjani, is a opportunistic and corrupt "snake", continued Labeed.  Though Labeed knew little about the new Iranian president, he predicted that he would be unable to fulfill his campaign promise to fight corruption.  The United States, Labeed advised, should not antagonize Alamdinejad, and give him no opportunity to blame the US for his eventual failures.  --------------------- KURDS DO NOT KNOW HIM ---------------------  5.  (C) The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) representative to the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) Dilshad Miran told us June 29 that the Kurds have never met the new Iranian president and do not have an official position yet on him. They are disappointed, however, that such a perceived hardliner came to power -- especially one who is supported by the Iran Revolutionary Governing Council (IRGC). Miran said they are eager to visit the new President and so be able to make better judgments about his positions on Kurds and the KRG.  6.  (C) Comment:  Our Baghdad Iraqi contacts, including those in Da'wa and SCIRI were certain that Rafsanjani - whom they knew well - would win.  There has been a pause in Baghdad this week as the Iraqi political class weighs the implications of Ahmadinejad's victory.  It is entirely possible that some of Iraq's Kurdish and Shia parties will make the first quiet trips to Teheran to establish contact with the Iranian president.  Above all, what both our Shia and Kurdish contacts fear that Ahmadinejad might seek to destabilize the emerging, but shaky, political structure in Iraq.  7.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BAGHDAD 002790  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2015 TAGS: ENRG, EPET, MASS, MOPS, EFIN, EAGR, PREL, PGOV, IZ SUBJECT: IRAQ INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY:  MOD PLAN UPDATE TO NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL  REF: A. A. BAGHDAD 2694      B. B. BAGHDAD 2593 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR ANNE DERSE FOR REASONS 1.4 B   AND D   1. (C) SUMMARY: Iraq's National Energy Committee (NEC) reviewed the Ministry of Defense's (MOD) most recent plan for northern oil pipeline and infrastructure security during its 10th meeting on June 27.  DPM Chalabi and other NEC members were frustrated with MOD's failure to produce what they consider a viable plan, and are also concerned over the 4-6 month-long delay in MOD's current proposal until oil infrastructure protection will begin in earnest. The DPM expressed disappointment in the plan and the ITG's inability to use existing, trained Iraqi armed forces -- instead of the tribal battalions, which he views as largely ineffective -- to secure the key infrastructure in Iraq.  The tribal forces the ITG are now paying to protect the pipelines are the same people who are destroying the pipelines, he maintained. The DPM stated that the insurgents are trying to isolate Baghdad by attacking infrastructure, citing recent attacks on the Baghdad water supply facilities, oil and refinery product pipelines, electricity lines, towers, and substations. The DPM stressed, "infrastructure protection for oil is just as important as any other element of Iraqi security."  The Ministry of Water Resources (MOW) reported planned increases from 300 m3 per second to 500 m3 per second of flows of water from Turkey and a new study to revitalize the Bakhme dam to generate hydropower.  The Ministry of Electricity (ME) reported on plans to increase the availability of electricity by 2500-3000 MW by summer 2006 in Iraq. END SUMMARY.  2. (SBU) DPM Ahmed Chalabi convened the 10th meeting of the ITG National Energy Committee on June 27.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the revised Ministry of Defense plan to defend the northern Iraqi oil pipelines.  Those attending included the Deputy Minister of Electricity (ME), Deputy Minister of Water Resources (MWR), Deputy Minister of Finance (MOF), Deputy Minister of Industry and Minerals (MIM), Minister of Oil (MOO), Deputy Minister of Interior (MOI), MOD Director General of Programs and Budget, Deputy Commander of the Iraqi Armed Forces, EMINCOUNS, IRMO Director and emboffs.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- IRAQI ARMED FORCES UPADATED INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION PLAN --------------------------------------------- -------------  3.  (C) The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces updated the NEC on the revised infrastructure protection plan (reftels: BAGHDAD 2694, 2593 and previous).  The plan is to use the battalions of tribal forces in the Kirkuk area, which are currently known as the Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIB), to be the primary guards for the linear oil infrastructure between Kirkuk and Bayji.  These forces are to be recruited and trained over the next several months while concurrently guarding the pipelines. He said the US 42ID from Tikrit would be "training the trainers" in the four SIBS one company per cycle for three weeks, followed by a two week period of training the battalions. MOO will provide special lectures to the soldiers on oil security and protection of the pipelines. The MOD has begun to compile the required equipment list for the battalions.  The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces said it was not possible to train these units in only 3-4 months to take full control of the pipeline security operations. It would take at least six months. The funding for initial training, sustaining, and equipping of the units will be $35 million for the next three months.  The oversight of the training and the protection operations will be done from the Joint Forces Headquarters (JHQ) in Baghdad. The MOD will host the Infrastructure Coordination Cell with liaison elements from MOI, MWR, MNF-I, MOO, MOT, and ME. This organization will monitor activities across all ministries, identify protection requirements, and conduct the planning for infrastructure security operations.  4.  (C) The Commander of the 4th Iraqi Division, a Kurdish general from Kirkuk, questioned the Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces sharply on why he could not choose the commanders of the SIBs, since he was to be the overall commander of these units and knew the territory.  He suggested the MOD should consult with him when they wanted to hire commanders for these units. The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces told him he did not choose the commanders of the units, but rather the DPM and MOO chose these commanders. The DPM stated he would not discuss this action, while the MOO said nothing. The Commander of the 4th Division said he needed another battalion on the west side of the Tigris River to secure the crossing sites.  5.  (C) The DPM complained that the ITG was paying for 1000 soldiers per battalion and they were not accomplishing their mission of pipeline defense, and the Commanding General of the 4th Iraqi Division from Kirkuk complained there were usually only 200 men present for duty in these units.  This implied corruption in payments for salaries in his mind.  The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces told the DPM that it was taking time to fill the units, and not many men were volunteering for the positions.  The MOO then complained openly to the Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces that the current SIBs were totally ineffective and useless.  The DPM concurred and said these battalions were in fact the ones attacking the pipelines. The DPM stated the tribal leaders were the ones who were responsible for the destruction of the pipelines.  The government was paying them money for protection, and they were extorting additional funds by causing additional damage to the pipelines.  6.  (C) The MOO wanted to know when the pipelines would be secured so MOO could export oil to the North.  The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces said the plan needed to be approved by MNF-I, and said he would seek General Casey's approval this week.  The Iraqi NSC Deputy Director, BG Adel Aziz, said there would be 17 SIBs of 1000 men each.  At present there is no real structure to these units and those that exist are currently ineffective.  The DPM then interjected that, "we paid money for these battalions, and they have destroyed our pipelines. They are stopping our oil from reaching Turkey."  The DPM said he would call General Casey and ask him to assess the Iraqi forces.  He continued, stating, "the infrastructure protection for oil is just as important as any other element of Iraqi security."  7.  (C) Following the NEC's formal meeting, the DPM noted to emboffs that he was very dissatisfied with the current state of infrastructure security.  He did not want to use the unreliable SIBs to secure the economic lifeline for Iraq, but rather wants to have trained Iraqi Army battalions securing the pipelines and other infrastructure. The DPM acknowledged there is a political problem in that many of the currently trained Iraqi forces are Kurdish, and there is sensitivity in the ITG about sending them into non-Kurdish areas of the country in the run up to the constitutional debate.  ---------------- PIPELINE REPAIRS ----------------   8.  (SBU The Ministry of Finance (MOF) representative said it is taking far too long to repair the pipelines.  The MOD was stating it took 21-42 days to repair pipeline sabotage attacks.  The MOF representative said it should only take 4-5 days, and there was a huge monetary loss for each day the pipelines were not repaired. The MOO added that every time MOO repairs the pipelines, they are blown up again within a week.   -------------------- INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT --------------------  9.  (C) The MOI representative requested approval to establish an intelligence unit to oversee MOO due to concerns that MOO may have been infiltrated by insurgents, Baathists, and former intelligence elements from the Saddam era.  The principal concern is that every time MOO begins to ship oil along a pipeline, it is then attacked.  --------------------------------- INSURGENT PLAN TO ISOLATE BAGHDAD ---------------------------------  10.  (C) DPM stated that the insurgents were trying to isolate Baghdad by attacking infrastructure.  He cited the attacks on the Baghdad water supply facilities; oil and refinery product pipelines; electricity lines, towers, and substations. (NOTE: During the six day period from June 18 to June 24 2005, the 18-inch crude pipeline between Basrah and Baghdad; the 12-inch Baghdad petroleum product ring pipeline; the 10-inch petroleum product pipeline from Baghdad to Latifyah; and the 14-inch LPG Bayji to Baghdad pipeline all were interdicted by insurgent IED attacks. Moreover, the 26- and 30-inch crude oil and 16-inch natural gas pipelines at Al Fathah suffered explosions; the cause is uncertain at this time.  The disruptions cut off pipeline crude deliveries to the Daura (Baghdad) and Bayji refineries, natural gas deliveries to the Taji and Daura power plants, crude oil deliveries to the Musayyib and Quds power plants, and product deliveries between the two largest depots in the Baghdad area.  All three of Iraq's refineries - Bayji, Daura (Baghdad) and Basrah - are now operating at 50 per cent of capacity.  Though days of supply for all products in the Baghdad area remain sufficient, Baghdad could see shortages in 7-10 days, depending on how quickly the pipelines are repaired and refineries return to normal operating levels. In this same period, two-thirds of the water supply to Baghdad was interdicted by insurgent attacks on the water supply network, causing severe water shortages and hardships to the populace in Baghdad, while multiple electricity lines and towers were interdicted, reducing power availability in Baghdad. END NOTE)   ---------------------- INCREASED ELECTRICITY -----------------------  11.  (SBU) The Deputy Minister for the ME reported to the NEC on the progress of added electrical power availability for Iraq.  Current electricity production in terms of MWH, he stated, was at the highest level in the history of Iraq. Agreements have been made with IRAN, TURKEY, SYRIA and on-going negotiations with KUWAIT for additional electrical power for Iraq.  On Iran, he said he confirmed an addition to the current 100 MW, stating Iran will provide a total of 600 MW as of next summer at $.05 per KWH, and that Iran had an excess of 9000 MW of electricity capacity.  The imports from Turkey are currently 175 MW, and this will rise to 900 MW by summer 2006 if details can be worked out with the EU.  Syria currently provides 70 MW of electricity and this will continue.  Kuwait currently provides no electric power to Iraq, since it has no regular surplus. However, there are on-going negotiations the construction of power plants in Kuwait that would dedicate all output to Iraq. These import agreements, and the ongoing construction projects will provide an estimated 2500-3000 MW of additional power by mid-2006 to the Iraqi grid.  (NOTE:  IRMO officials believe the mid-2006 estimate to be overly optimistic.  Detailed engineering studies and transmission network upgrades need to be performed before approximately 1500 MW of additional power can be imported into Iraq.  A more realistic estimate is early 2007.  END NOTE)  12.  (SBU) The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) reported planned increases from 300 m3 to 500 m3 on flows of water from Turkey and a new study to revitalize the Bekhme dam to generate hydropower.  He stated that the Bekhme dam was 30 per cent complete. The dam was first proposed in 1952, and Saddam initiated construction in 1988.  Work on the dam was halted during the war periods, and much of the structure is intact and can be used in the completion of the project.  If it is completed, it will be the largest project in Iraq.  The DPM requested that the MWR provide a study on the dam project and present it to the NEC for future funding consideration. MWR said that a Japanese firm was doing a study of the dam now to provide current cost and construction estimates.  The original costs for this dam were $1.5-billion for initial completed construction and a total former cost completion total of $7.0-billion in the late 1980's.  13.  (SBU) The ME also asked the DPM for support on the rational use of electricity across Iraq, specifically complaining about the province of Basrah hoarding electricity.  The DPM said it was wrong for the provinces to not share electricity, and that ME should move a portion of the Basrah electricity across the nation of Iraq.  Allocation of electricity should be done according to the Summer Electricity Plan.  The ME also reported some of the power plants could have produced additional electric power, but were unable to get fuel from the MOO.  The MOO responded that the saboteurs had destroyed the pipelines, which prevented the delivery of the fuel to the ME.  --------------------- OIL PRODUCTION STATUS ---------------------  14.  (SBU) MOO reported the decline of oil exports continuing, with exports having dropped from 1.8-million bpd in 2004 to 1.45-million bpd currently.  He said MOO expected additional declines unless security of the pipelines improved.  MOO said that over 90 per cent of all problems with exports were related to attacks on infrastructure.  The DPM instructed the MOO to come up with a plan for increased production of oil for export.  MOO responded he was working on it, and immediately added he would no longer provide crude oil, now selling for $ 60 per barrel, for additional power generation -- the ME would need to burn natural gas or Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in place of crude oil in power plants.  MOO said he would come up with a plan to provide additional natural gas to the ME.  The DPM said the gas turbines for electrical generation should use natural gas, and that these power plants were being destroyed by the use of other fuels instead of natural gas.  The DPM said he wanted the natural gas and hydropower electrical plants to generate the base power generation capacity in Iraq, and use the diesel thermal plants only to meet peak load demands.  --------------------------------------------- ------- AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING OF NATIONAL ENERGY COMMITTEE --------------------------------------------- -------  15.  (C) The DPM said the next meeting of the NEC would review the status of infrastructure protection plan on the following Monday.  ------- COMMENT -------  16.  (C) COMMENT:  The NEC remains dissatisfied with MOD's infrastructure security plan and frustrated that the ITG cannot use the Iraqi Army to defend key infrastructure.  The DPM's comments on the insurgents' plan to isolate Baghdad and cut the capital off from the rest of the country, and his examples of how well it was working, appeared to be of great concern to the Iraqi Ministries present.  The news relayed at the meeting was somber:  oil production is going down and is expected to continue dropping in the South, while the pipelines in the North are under constant interdiction and very little oil can be exported through Turkey.  To add to the gloom, the representative from MIM said his minister could not attend, because the minister's cousin had just been assassinated, and he was at the funeral. END COMMENT. Satterfield

Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Former Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) Minister of Electricity Ayham al-Samara'i is trying to forge a name by organizing a political party understood to have ties to insurgent groups.  At a June 29 press conference, Samara'i justified these groups "resisting the occupation by all available means".  Another Sunni leader discounts Samarai's ability to gain traction with this approach since Samara'i was a previous member of the government.  We intend to meet with Samara'i and raise our strong disagreement with his comments in the next few days. END SUMMARY.  2.  (U) Former Iraqi Interim Government Minister of Electricity and previous Dr. Pachachi-ally Ayham al- Samarai formed the "National Council for Unity and Reconstruction of Iraq" on 29 June.  Among the council's stated aims was an acknowledgement of the "people's right to resist the occupation by all available means, a right enshrined in heavenly and worldly system."  Samarai described the setup in Iraq as an "unlawful military occupation... continuous blatant violation of Iraqi human rights...and increasing suffering of the Iraqi people over the past two years of occupation."  In addition, Samarai distinguished between the "legitimate Iraqi resistance" and terrorism, which the council rejected.  3.  (C/NF) Sunni National Dialogue Council member Saleh al-Mutlak remarked to PolOff 1 July that although he is a friend of Samarai's, he does not approve of the means by which Samarai is trying to make a name for himself.  Mutlak noted how Samarai benefited from the Coalition through his appointment to the Minister of Electricity position in the IIG and was accused of one of the most corrupt officials in the government.  Mutlak doubted Samarai would get any traction through the council since the people viewed him as corrupt and as a member of the former government.  4.  (C/NF) Comment:  We will seek out Samarai to express to him our unequivocal disapproval of his remarks about.  5.  (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.

FORD. REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  At the July 30 Gender Working group, an Embassy-sponsored forum for women representing all sectors of society to express their views, the only clear consensus among participants was of the pressing need to educate the Iraqi public -- especially women - - regarding their rights and the role of the constitution.  Participants generally agreed that a quota system is necessary to ensure adequate representation of women in the government, but some advocated limiting that system.  Members of the women's branch of Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) attended the meeting for the first time, generating a heated discussion when they advocated Shari'a as the main source for the constitution.   Conservative Muslims, non-Muslims, and secularists did not find common ground on the extent to which Shari'a should be a source for the constitution.  END SUMMARY.  ----------------------------------------- LITTLE CONSENSUS ON CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES -----------------------------------------  2.  (C) Iraqi women participated in a heated discussion of the constitution during the weekly Embassy-sponsored Gender Working Group meeting.  This group has evolved as a forum for women representing all sectors of society to express their views and listen to the views of others in a mutually respectful environment.  Comprising Sunnis, Shi'a, Kurds, Turkmen, and Christians, as well as Islamic conservatives and secularists, the group agreed on only one issue during this meeting -- the need for education and outreach at the grassroots level. Former Governing Council member Songul Chapook told the group that, during a recent meeting in Kirkuk she realized that most women are 'ignorant' not only regarding the constitution, but also with respect to their basic rights.  (COMMENT:  The need for outreach has been a common theme in these meetings, and is echoed by conservative and liberal elements alike.  At the June 23 meeting, Sadr City Council member Siham Hattab emphasized that the public's lack of knowledge about such issues as federalism and women's rights means that they will rely exclusively on their religious leaders or, in the case of women, their male relatives.  There are women-oriented outreach programs underway through USIP, NDI, America's Democratic Foundation, and other USAID grantees.  The challenge is to get these programs to extend more broadly down to the grassroots level sooner rather than later, if possible.  END COMMENT.)  3.  (C) Although the women did not all agree about the need for a quota system to ensure adequate representation by women in the government, the majority said it is necessary to include such a system in the constitution.  The real bone of contention regarding this issue, however, was its implementation. Some suggested that the quota system supports the "quantity over quality" approach, while others insisted that it is a way for women -- while a cadre of competent representatives is developed -- to have a voice that they would not otherwise have.  Many favored including a quota provision in the constitution, but with specific time limitations.  4.  (C) Participants reached partial consensus that the constitution should be based on international human rights standards and accord all Iraqis -- men and women alike -- due process and equal status before the law.  Several women suggested that the constitution should guarantee women social security benefits, unemployment compensation, and medical insurance, while others argued that it should guarantee only the most basic rights and legislation could be enacted afterwards to address issues such as these.  ----------- SCIRI SCARE -----------  5.  (C) The discussion of the relationship between religion and state was the most heated.  Secular and non-Muslim participants argued that basing the constitution on Shari'a would limit the rights of non- Muslims in general and women in particular.  The conservatives countered that it is not Shari'a that limits women's rights.  Rather, they argued, it is 'tradition' that plays a larger role in impeding women's rights.  6.  (C) Thekra Fadhel and Ethar Hussain, both members of Shaheed Al Mihrab, which is SCIRI's women's branch, argued strongly and intractably for a constitution based on Shari'a, saying that "God is the source of all things" and insisting that it is only right that the country's legal foundation should be based on this concept.  The SCIRI women generated strong debate, eliciting negative reactions from almost every other participant -- to include representatives from the Iraqi Women's Islamic League.  7.  (C) COMMENT: The SCIRI representatives have not previously attended meetings of the Gender Working Group.  Their apparent objective was to influence this group and use it as a platform for conservative policies.  According to Shilair Rasheed Mohammed (Kurdish list - hardly a disinterested party), the conservative agenda is to push the "Iranian model." She told PolFSN on June 29 that, when other constitutional models are referenced during Constitution Committee meetings, the List 169 delegates invariably raises the Iranian model. END COMMENT.  ------------------------------------- CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS SILENT -------------------------------------  8.  (C) Despite the uproar caused by the SCIRI women, Constitution Committee members Munira Abdul and Narjis Majeed Amin, both from the Kurdish list, had little reaction to any of the discussion.  Their input was limited to a brief overview of articles in Kurdistan's law that support women's rights.  While they expressed openness to listening to the women's recommendations, they had little to add to the overall discussion.  ------- COMMENT -------  9.  (C) The Gender Working Group meetings have provided Post with invaluable insight into the minds of Iraqi women of all orientations.  Participation has grown from less than a dozen women to standing room only.  Clearly Iraq's women want and need a forum for addressing those issues of concern to them.  Today's meeting went far to clarify the thinking of these women relative to the constitution.  It is important to note that, even these women -- who tend to be more politically engaged and educated -- struggle with what a constitution is and can actually do for them.  One must wonder then, what the average, less-educated woman understands about the political and constitutional development processes.  At a minimum, it highlights the need for aggressive outreach and education campaigns.  10.  (C) Most striking was the reaction of the working group participants to the statements made by the SCIRI women.  The room simply erupted before they even finished speaking.  Many women were almost out of their seats as they vocally and dramatically argued the extent to which Shari'a should play a role in the constitution.  There were no pretenses at politeness. It was no easy feat to calm the group, and it was clear that there would be no consensus on this issue. Also palpable was the fear of the majority regarding the influence the List 169 views on religion and state would have on their future rights.  As one observer so aptly put it, "If this group is representative of the Iraqi people on this issue, it is time to batten down the hatches."  Kurdish women, including those who are not secular, tend to be some of the most vocal supporters of women's rights.  The apparent reluctance of prominent Kurdish women such as Munira Abdul and Narjis Majeed Amin, to say anything substantive on women's issues was noticeable.  If Iraqi women who espouse non-Islamist views do not develop strong, articulate leadership, it will be harder for them to push back against Islamist conservatives.  END COMMENT.  11.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002804  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  NEA/I PLEASE PASS GRAMAGLIA, SILVERMAN, EB/TRA  TAGS: EAIR, PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ECON, IZ SUBJECT: BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LIKELY TO CLOSE AGAIN AS "GOOD FAITH" BECOMES "BAD FAITH"  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED  USG DISTRIBUTION ONLY  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION  REF: BAGHDAD 2745 AND PREVIOUS  1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) appears poised for closure yet again Sunday, July 3 at 1700 local time due to the Iraq Transitional Government's (ITG) inability to meet the obligations it agreed to last week (REFTEL).  If Global Risk Management ("Global"), the current security contractor, orders another "stand down" on n July 3 the ITG will likely move to replace Global via an emergency bid process.  Our best guess is that BIAP will remain closed to civilian air operations for up to three weeks as the ITG mobilizes a new security force.  Before BIAP can reopen the new security procedures must be assessed and pass muster with both Coalition and Iraqi military commands at BIAP.  We raised the possible imminent closure of BIAP with Laith Kubba, an advisor to the Prime Minister on July 2.  Kubba was disturbed, saying he thought the matter had been resolved and that he would look into it immediately.  If Global departs and new security arrangements are put in place by the ITG, the Embassy will request the Department of Homeland Security to immediately redeploy a Transportation Security Administration team to BIAP in order to evaluate the new security operation and get the airport up and running again as soon as possible. END SUMMARY.  2. (SBU) Despite agreed to "next steps" (REFTEL) on resolving the BIAP security situation, the ITG has not acted to meet its obligations to pay its outstanding debts to Global.  On June 29 the Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Transportation should have sent paperwork to the Ministry of Finance to effect payment of the close to $12 million owed to Global.  This did not occur, despite draft language and other support provided by both the Embassy's IRMO Finance and IRMO Transportation offices.  3. (SBU) Intense contract negotiations held earlier last week ceased as Global reported an inability to contact their counterparts.  Meetings planned for June 29-30 (last days of the Iraqi work week) between ITG lawyers and Global attorneys to discuss contract language did not occur. According to Global, their Iraqi counterparts did not return phone calls throughout the day.  Global's in-country management told us on July 1 that Global's Board of Directors believes that the ITG is deliberately deceiving them.  The company committed to providing U.S. military commanders at BIAP a 24-hour warning prior to "standing down" their operations.  4. (SBU) EMINCOUNS alerted PM advisor Laith Kubba on July 2 to the possible imminent closure of BIAP, and the possibility of a two to three week period in which it would remain closed until new procedures are in place.  Kubba was disturbed, saying that he thought the issue had been resolved.  He said he would look into it immediately and get back to us.  5. (SBU) COMMENT: Global suspects, and we are inclined to believe, that senior levels of the ITG have been actively working to line up possible successors to the security contract at BIAP while keeping up the pretense of engagement with Global.  Now that mechanisms such as the emergency bid procedure are in place, Global's utility as an "interim measure" to keep the commercial side of BIAP open may have lost its appeal.  Regardless of what arrangements the ITG may have worked out, a two to three week closure of service is extremely likely.  If the ITG replaces Global at BIAP, the Embassy will require the immediate services of a TSA assessment team for 3-5 days to evaluate the replacement firm's security measures in order to get the airport up and running again as soon as possible.  We also strongly encourage the earliest possible deployment of the DHS attache to the Embassy and the agreed-upon TSA advisors to serve at BIAP for 90 days until Embassy is able to hire its own aviation security experts.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002805  SIPDIS  NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, EPET, IZ, National Assembly, United Iraqi Alliance SUBJECT: TNA MEMBER QASIM DAOUD ON CONSTITUTION, SISTANI, AND POSSIBLE BREAKUP OF UNITED IRAQI ALLIANCE  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Prominent Shia political figure, parliamentarian and Assembly constitutional committee member Qasim Daoud said 30 June the committee has been reluctant to confront sensitive issues such as Kirkuk, federalism, and Arab identity.  Daoud supported the TAL language for Arab identity that says only "Arabs of Iraq are part of the Arab nation".  Daoud said he met last week with Sistani who held reservations about federalism.  Reportedly, Sistani worried that neighboring countries would interfere in Iraq without a strong central government.  Sistani allegedly shared the USG view that the central government should own Iraq's natural resources.  According to Daoud, Sistani also believes that the electoral law be changed to multiple rather than a single electoral district for the next elections.  Daoud opined that in the next elections the Shia Islamist party SCIRI would seek to run without entangling alliances.  By contrast, hardj- line Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr would likely with Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi for the December elections.  Daoud, who had been on Prime Minister's Allawi election list, said he probably would jump ship to join SCIRI given its grassroots support made possible by extensive Iranian patronage.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------------------------- Views on Federalism and Arab Identity -------------------------------------  2.  (C/NF) TNA constitutional committee member Qassim Daoud told Poloff 30 June he believes the committee will make the constitution deadline, although he admitted the committee is avoiding crucial issues like federalism, Kirkuk, and Iraq's Arab identity rather than confronting them outright.  Having so many of the committee's key players out of Iraq has slowed progress.  Moreover, broad agreements will be even harder once the Sunni Arabs join the committee in force, Daoud predicted.  Daoud also commented about:  --ARAB IDENTITY:  Daoud said he would support the TAL language that states the "Arabs of Iraq are part of the Arab nation".  Iraq is multi-ethnic and it is not fair to force an Arab identity on them, he mused.  --FEDERALISM:  Daoud listened to the USG position as relayed by PolOff that the central government should own Iraq's resources.  (Note:  Daoud in septel was the first one to raise with PolOff the proposal that natural resources would be owned by the regions, and revenues would be split 50/50 by the center and regions.)  Daoud responded that Sistani also wanted natural resources to be owned by the central government.  Daoud asked USG position on one large Southern Shia region.  PolOff responded that we would support a federal structure that promotes the unity of Iraq.  One large "Shia state" in the South might incite sectarian divisions, suggested PolOff.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Daoud and VP 'Abd al Mehdi Visit Ayatollah Sistani --------------------------------------------- ----  3.  (C/NF) Daoud detailed 30 June his and Vice President Abdel Mehdi's visit to Nasiriyah and Najaf, which he described as very productive and encouraging. In Nasiriyah, they were received by hundreds of people and were able to mingle with and discuss the constitution with them.  Daoud said he was struck at how peaceful the area was and yet so impoverished; he bemoaned the lack of reconstruction projects in the area to date.  Daoud complained that the US, NGOs, and the ITG always used the excuse of "security" for slowing reconstruction efforts; he asserted this argument holds no water in the South.  4.  (C/NF) Daoud said Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani remained suspicious about federalism.  According to Daoud, Sistani fears a weak central government will draw neighboring countries to interfere in Iraqi affairs.  Daoud said Sistani specifically mentioned Iranian interference:  he feared that if there were Shia regions in the South with significant responsibility and autonomy, Iran would have a greater opportunity to build strong and overly influential relationships with them.  5.  (C/NF) Daoud also reported that Sistani also stressed he would intervene in Iraqi politics again if the electoral system is not changed before the next election.  Sistani believed the system must be changed from single-district to provincial-based elections, which would prevent Kurdish fraud from affecting the number of representatives allotted the rest of the country and could also encourage greater Sunni participation.  (Note:  PolOff told him the IECI would need to be apprised immediately of changes in the election system so that it could do its own planning. Daoud said he would raise the issue with them.  A new election law could be necessary.  End Note.)  --------------------------------------------- --- Daoud Claims UIA to Break Apart, Might Join SCIRI --------------------------------------------- ---  6.  (C/NF) Daoud said that the United Iraqi Alliance is falling apart and will not stand for the next elections.  SCIRI wants to go it alone and Muqtada al- Sadr is likely to split off with Chalabi, he continued.  (Note:  Chalabi deputy Nabil al-Mussawi separately claimed to PolOff 29 June that the INC hopes to soon announce its official intention to leave the UIA.  Mussawi said they are trying to solidify the alliance with Muqtada al-Sadr.)  7.  (C/NF) Daoud said Da'wa will also go on its own but will be hamstrung by its lack of grassroots support.  Daoud believes Allawi will pair up with the Sunnis.  Daoud said he could not join with Allawi, going so far as to call him a "dictator" because of his conspiratorial mindset and leadership style. Daoud added that Allawi has even rejected Daoud's attempts to meet with him because he thinks Daoud betrayed him by wanting to join the government when Allawi opposed the idea.  Daoud claimed over half of Allawi's Iraqiya bloc in the Assembly (23 individuals) wanted to leave the list with him.  However, he convinced them to remain with al-Iraqiya for the time being to avoid showing outright dissension within the list.  8.  (C/NF) In the next elections, Daoud said he will probably join a political alliance with SCIRI, pointing to his close ties to VP 'Abd al Mehdi.  Daoud said SCIRI lacked a cohesive or strong ideology unlike Da'wa with its extensive writings of its Islamist creed.  Moreover, SCIRI has been very successful at building significant grassroots support in Iraq through its TV channel, al-Furat.  SCIRI also benefits from its support for Shia religious events like Ashura to capitalize on the three million people that attend them.  Daoud claimed the reason for SCIRI's success was financing -- which he acknowledged came from Iran. On overall Iranian political support for Iraqi parties, Daoud posited that SCIRI was the largest benefactor, followed by Da'wa, and then Ahmed Chalabi.  ---------------------------- Daoud to Visit Iran in August ----------------------------  9.  (C/NF) Daoud said he was still in a wait and see mode about the new Iranian President Mahmad Ahmadinejad.  He will have a better idea in late August when he visits Tehran at the invitation of President Khatami.  What most concern Daoud are Iranian nuclear ambitions and their interference in Iraqi affairs.  He claims he will address these matters on his visit.  10.  (C/NF) Comment:  We have heard from others that the UIA is starting to disintegrate, but we assess it will likely hold together until the December elections.  It still shows signs of functionality; for example, the 21-man leadership committee still holds frequent meetings.  Daoud's split from Allawi will deal a large blow to Allawi's secular support base; Daoud jumping to SCIRI will let the Shia Islamist party claim the backing of a major "secular" Shia.  It is not surprising Daoud would choose this new alignment given his significant contacts to Sistani and the hawza and his obvious ambition.  Daoud has striven hard to maintain positive relations with all of the Iraqi political entities, such as the Islamists and Kurds, in order to secure his own political standing.  11.  (C/NF) Comment continued:  Regarding the federalism issue, if Daoud is to be believed, Sistani's position appears to be close to ours with respect to the central government's ownership of natural resources.  Daoud has been one of the backers of regional ownership and we will watch with interest if Sistani's dislike of the idea will sway him and other members of the constitutional committee.  Kurds, of course, will continue to press hard for regional ownership.  This will be a key element of the federalism debate.  12.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002807  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2011 TAGS: ECPS, ECON, IZ, Media SUBJECT: NCMC BOARD UNDER QUORUM  REF: A. 04 BAGHDAD 2296       B. BAGHDAD 1800      C. BAGHDAD 2191  Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor Anne Derse for reasons 1.4 (  b) and (d).  1.    (C) SUMMARY:  Membership of the National Communications and Media Commission (NCMC) Board of Commissioners is below the legally required quorum and, therefore, its decisions are subject to legal challenge. NCMC Director General (who prefers to be known as the CEO) Othman plans on presenting a list of commissioner candidates to President Talabani in July. The UK's Media Development and Advisory Team (MDAT) contract has been extended for 3 months and they will immediately begin lobbying the ITG for the appointment of a full nine member NCMC Board of Commissioners, which must be confirmed by the TNA. We will support MDAT's efforts and focus on the telecom initiatives pending before the NCMC. END SUMMARY  ------------------------ ORDER 65 REQUIRES QUORUM ------------------------  2.    (SBU)  CPA Order 65 created the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission (since re-named the NCMC), the Board of Commissioners (&the Board8) of which consists of nine members. Decisions of the Board are made by majority vote, "provided that at least six (6) of the members are present and vote." The Board has been without the legally required quorum since November 23, 2004, when former PM Allawi forced the resignation of four of the nine commissioners, leaving the Board with five commissioners (REF A). In the interim, former NCMC Commissioner Masum's recent appointment as Minister of Communications leaves the Board with only 4 members. Therefore, any decisions by the current Board are subject to legal challenge. We have pointed this out to Othman and discussed it with senior advisers to Prime Minister Ja,afari, since only Ja,afari has the authority to appoint NCMC commissioners subject to approval by majority vote of the Transitional National Assembly (REF B).  3. (SBU) In addition, Order 65 requires monthly meetings. Board members who fail to participate in three or more successive meetings are subject to dismissal.  We have been unable to verify whether regular monthly meetings occur, but if they do, there is no record or procedure in place memorializing the meetings and the decisions made.  Again, challenging current board members' right to their appointed seats will inflict further damage to the NCMC. We have discussed the situation with Othman who agreed with the necessity of complying with Order 65.  ------------------------------------- NCMC INITIATIVES SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE -------------------------------------  3.    (SBU) The NCMC has several critical initiatives scheduled for completion in 2005.  The Wireless Local Loop (WLL) RFI and the mobile license re-tender are the most visible. The mobile license re-tender, in particular, has been specifically designed and advertised to attract high level foreign investors and is expected to bring in tens of millions of dollars per bidder. The greatest vulnerability to the NCMC is the challenge to its authority to grant licenses to operate and assign spectrum to new entrants and winning bidders.  For example, the mobile licensing re-tender, if not conducted according to Order 65, is open to legal challenge. A legal challenge to the award of mobile licenses in December would create uncertainty for mobile customers, the industry and irreparably harm the NCMC.  ----------------------------------- NCMC CEO PLANS TO SUBMIT LIST TO PM -----------------------------------  4.    (SBU) NCMC CEO Othman told us June 22 that he plans to submit a list of commissioner candidates to President Talabani at the beginning of July.  The list includes himself in the combined position of the Chair of the Board and Acting CEO.  Othman stated that while he appreciated our help, he did not want the US involved in picking candidates and if he needed help "I will come to you" (REF C). Order 65 prohibits the Director General (CEO) from holding any other government positions, to include serving as a member of the Board, and it is clear that the intent of the Order contemplates a clear separation between oversight and implementation.  ------------------------------------------ UK MDAT CONTRACT EXTENDED FOR THREE MONTHS ------------------------------------------  5.     (SBU)  The USG and UK have coordinated closely on the creation and development of the NCMC as an independent regulatory body for telecommunications and broadcast.   The British Foreign Service Office has been responsible for the media and broadcast institutional framework at the NCMC through the MDAT, while the USG is concentrating its technical advice on the telecommunications area.  Upon learning a few weeks ago that the MDAT's contract would not be renewed by the UK, the Charge sent a letter to UK Ambassador Patey suggesting that continued funding and support of the MDAT through the December elections is important.  MDAT informed us on June 28 that their contract is renewed for 3 months.  We will continue to pursue an extension of their services through the election.  -------------------------------------- UK MDAT WILL LOBBY FOR FULL NCMC BOARD --------------------------------------  6.    (C) MDAT's first priority is to get the ITG to appoint a full complement of nine commissioners to the Board, in accordance with Order 65, thereby ensuring that NCMC decisions are legal and less vulnerable to challenge by the industry.  Simon Haselock, the lead member of the MDAT, stated that MDAT's strategy is to educate the ITG on the importance of the NCMC, its role in bringing in foreign investment and the vulnerability of all of its decisions, particularly the mobile re-tender, while operating without a quorum.  MDAT will not recommend particular candidates, but will stress the need to meet the requirements set out in Order 65.  MDAT will not oppose or support Othman's current position or his quest to be Chair, other than to advise the ITG that he cannot, without violating Order 65, be both a commissioner, chair or otherwise, and CEO at the same time. (NOTE: Order 65 states that the CEO of the NCMC may not hold any executive or legislative position, appointed or elected, at any level of government. END NOTE).  7. (C) Othman will initially present his suggested list of commissioners to fellow Kurd, President Talabani, in order to enlist his help with the PM. Haselock, therefore, met with President Talabani's Chief of Staff, Kamran Karadaghi, on June 29, to discuss the need for a properly established board.   Karadaghi stated that he is familiar with Order 65. He is also familiar with Othman and told Haselock he is well aware of Othman's management style alluding to, according to Haselock, Othman's micromanagement of issues. Karadaghi agreed that the NCMC is an important regulatory institution and must be made to fully comply with the law so that future decisions are not challenged, the mobile re-tender among the most important.  Haselock told Karadaghi that Othman intends to submit a list of candidates with himself in the combined Chair/CEO role.  Karadaghi agreed that the combined role was inconsistent with the intent of Order 65 and that he would counsel against it. Karadaghi agreed to use his influence to assist in the process of appointing new commissioners.  8. (C) MDAT will also enlist the assistance of Minister of Communication, Jowan Masum, as an advocate within the government for a NCMC that is operating in full accord with existing law. Karadaghi agreed with Haselock's strategy to engage Masum on this issue.  ---------------------------------- USG WILL COMPLEMENT MDAT'S EFFORTS ----------------------------------  9.(C) We will assist MDAT in its efforts to educate the ITG on the need to appoint five commissioners to the NCMC and create a full complement of board members as set out in Order 65.  Our strategy will complement MDAT's focus on educating the ITG on what is required by current law and the risks attendant to NCMC decisions made while there is no legal quorum. Our focus will remain on telecommunications, while MDAT focuses on the risk to broadcasting/media decisions.  10. (SBU) We plan to use the following talking points:  --Order 65 requires six sitting and voting commissioners for a quorum, but given the substantive challenges and the amount of work in front of the NCMC today, we recommend five new appointments to create a fully staffed Board.  --NCMC has several initiatives that will increase local telecommunications penetration.  The mobile license re-tender will bring in millions to the treasury while offering world-class mobile services to customers throughout Iraq. Both are vital to the economic growth of the country and legal challenges to the NCMC's decisions on these initiatives will severely impede that growth.  --The eligibility criteria for commissioner candidates must be consistent with Order 65.  --Order 65 clearly contemplates a separation between executive and administrative functions and offices, and commissioners should not hold any other NCMC positions.  --Order 65 defines that the PM recommends candidates and the Transitional National Assembly ratifies by simple majority. This process, because it is based on consensus building, is time consuming and must start immediately. --NCMC's Broadcast Program Code of Practice will be essential in the upcoming election.  This code prohibits all broadcasters (including terrestrial and satellite) from inciting violence or public disorder, transmitting terrorist messages, or airing unfair or inaccurate broadcasts. A legal challenge on the validity of the NCMC's authority would impede enforcement. --NCMC established a code for media during election campaign periods.  This code, which was in effect during the period leading up to the January 2005 elections, requires all media to report on elections accurately and fairly and requires broadcast media to provide equitable and balanced coverage of all political parties.  Again, a legal challenge on the validity of the NCMC's authority would impede enforcement. 11. (C) COMMENT: Our support of MDAT's efforts to engage the government on the need to nominate and confirm five commissioners to the Board is warranted despite Othman's request that we not get involved.  First, Othman's concerns over US involvement stems from his fear that we will challenge his choices and the combined Chair/CEO role he desires.  Our joint strategy with MDAT is not to get involved in any way on individual nominees but to educate the ITG on the requirements set out in Order 65. We will continually stress the need to comply with the law. Second, based on experience with Othman, he will not move quickly enough, or be tenacious enough, to accomplish the task in time for the mobile license re-tender.  We need to convince him that it is appropriate for us to engage the government on an issue of compliance with Iraqi law, especially in a situation where the viability of an important institution is at stake.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002809  SIPDIS  STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/PPD, NEA/PPA, NEA/AGS, INR/IZ, INR/P E.0. 12958: N/A TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, KPAO, IZ, Media Reaction SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ, CONSTITUTION, SHIITES, SUNNIS, NEGOTIATIONS, INSURGENCY; BAGHDAD  1. SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July. 3 were the preparations for drafting the constitution and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Yesterday's prey and today's hunter" (Al-Ittihad, 7/3) B. "Negotiations with resistance solve an American and not Iraqi problem" (Al-Mada, 7/3)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Yesterday's prey and today's hunter" (Al-Ittihad, 7/3)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a fifth-paged editorial by Faryad Rawanduzi about the constitution:  "Some individuals are asking why the Americans are insisting on Sunni participation in the constitutional committee and the political process in Iraq?  Those with inside knowledge may be asking why the U.S. is choosing to intervene directly on this issue while discussing other issues indirectly. In order to answer these two questions, we must ask if the Bush administration is afraid of failure in Iraq. Is it afraid of the current Iraqi politicians who have begun to implement this new project in Iraq?  Without a doubt, the U.S. began reconsidering some of its policies regarding Iraq because the new situation has led the Shiites and Kurds - the winners of the political process - to dominate the political process. On the other hand, the Sunnis boycotted the elections because they thought that the Iraqi-American project opposed their own n aspirations. However, the U.S. objectives in Iraq also oppose some official and unofficial Shiite viewpoints. For this reason, the U.S. has had to resort to the "lost son" in order to restore balance to the unfair political process. The "lost son" that we are referring to is the Arab Sunni community. Indeed, the recent American discussions with the Arab Sunnis clearly indicates that the U.S. administration is confident with the Shiite understanding of the American role in Iraq.  We realize that the U.S. has depended largely on the Shiites after it guaranteed the Kurds a major political role in an attempt to establish a country without anti- American sentiment. It is true that the participation of the Arab Sunnis is important to the Americans but it is also important for Iraq. In fact, the recent American insistence on supporting the Arab Sunnis represents a strong message to the Arab Shiites. This message informs the Shiites that the American strategy is to ensure the redistribution of the political balance in Iraq. The U.S. is conveying this message and providing concessions to the Arab Sunnis in an attempt to gain their participation and to end the Sunni insurgency. As a result, the Sunnis will participate in the U.S.-engineered political project.  It appears that the Arab Sunnis have finally realized that they must knock at the American door if they want to participate in the political process. However, it is useless to knock on this door unless there have been real changes in the Arab Sunni's political strategy toward the American presence. Once that occurs, there will be American guarantees for Sunni participation in the political process. From their perspective, the Arab Shiites have begun to understand the significance of the new American orientation toward the Arab Sunnis. The Shiite political parties have been put on a state of alert because they understand that any American gesture to the Sunnis will be made at their expense. This implies that the Shiites will lose some positions and privileges. Therefore, if the Shiites do not make a gesture to support the new American position, the Iraqi equation will become more complicated.  It is possible that the constitution will not be completed on time or new factors in the Iraqi political scene may come to the fore. The hawks in the White House will not hesitate to fly over the Sunni Triangle. Nor will they hesitate to build nests in the middle of the insurgency. The hawks will not hesitate to give yesterday's prey to the hunters in order to experience political profits in Iraq."  B. "Negotiations with the 'resistance' solves the American problem, not the Iraqi problem" (Al-Mada, 7/3)  Al-Mada (independent) published a front-page editorial by Jamal Abdul Rahim about the American negotiations with the Iraqi insurgency:  "Over the past few days, the American government has announced that it has held negotiations with the Iraqi resistance. The Iraqi and foreign media outlets paid great attention to this frank confession. We all have the right to hypothesize that these negotiations will prove successful. But what would success mean to the Iraqi people?  Which party to the conflict will be able to free itself from its problems by experiencing success? Is it Iraq? The U.S.? Perhaps both?  The answer to this question is very important for all Iraqis who are determined to stop the bloodshed in Iraq. The Iraqi people can urge the government to actively participate in these negotiations. However, our problem is that the real Iraqi picture is different from what the media outlets are portraying. The truth is that these negotiations will never improve the stability of the security situation in Iraq. Perhaps such negotiations can reduce pressure on the American government by leading to a reduction in the number of American loses in Iraq. I say that hypothetically because the Americans are negotiating with leaders of the Iraqi 'resistance' who supposedly only target foreign troops, not Iraqis. Is there any proof that verifies this statement?  I think it is reasonable to discuss recent Iraqi and American reports that were published just days ago about the losses of Iraqi and American life in Iraq. The Pentagon published statistics stating that the number of American soldiers killed since last January has reached 307. Meanwhile, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior announced that the Iraqi loses reached 8,175 killed and 12,000 wounded during this same period. These two results indicate that the American loses represent no more than 4 percent while the Iraqi losses make up 96%.  It seems that the success of the negotiations with the resistance is aimed at reducing American loses. On the other hand, we do not know whether or not these negotiations will decrease the amount of Iraqi casualties. However, achieving success on this issue may uncover some armed groups that have insisted on provoking a civil war. These groups are undertaking operations under the slogan of jihad against the occupier. The supposed goal of these operations is to divide the Iraqi people into those that support the foreign forces and those that oppose them, thereby threatening Iraqi unity.  I discuss these issues while remembering the anniversary of transferring sovereignty to the Iraqis. Thank God that we have obtained our full sovereignty, at least in general. However, we still face minor issues that must be addressed. For example, we do not control the presidential palace, we were not advised that the Americans wanted to build the largest embassy in the world here in Baghdad, and nobody asked for our opinion in choosing and replacing American ambassadors. Additionally, we do not have any input regarding Saddam's trial. If the reports on American negotiations with the resistance are true, then we can also add this issue to the list. In our completely sovereign state, neither the government nor the National Assembly know anything about these negotiations."  SATTERFIELD

BAGHDAD 1206 C. BAGHDAD 2299 D. BAGHDAD 2527  THIS CABLE CONTAINS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION  FOR GOVERNMENT USE ONLY  NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION ON THE INTERNET.  1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Despite the efforts of the Iraqi and U.S. Governments, Iraq's Public Distribution (food ration) System (PDS) continues to deteriorate, leaving a significant portion of the population with few options to o supplement their food needs.  As the Iraqi Transition Government (ITG) attempts to keep the PDS functional, we believe USG and ITG efforts should be targeted to support those in Iraq who are truly dependent on the PDS to survive.  We will continue to urge ITG policymakers to undertake fundamental reform of the PDS at the earliest possible opportunity.  At the same time, the focus of the Embassy's efforts will shift from intensive daily monitoring of the PDS' functioning to encouraging and assisting the ITG towards put programs in place now that can create a rudimentary safety net for those most vulnerable as they continue to see less and less of the PDS benefit.  END SUMMARY  ------- THE PDS -------  2. (SBU) Iraq's Public Distribution System (PDS) was set up to provide a food ration basket to all Iraqis when U.N. sanctions were imposed following the first Gulf War.  While it is reported to have worked relatively well during much of the 1990's, anecdotal and spot reporting from both Baghdad and Regional Embassy Offices over the past several months indicate monthly food ration deliveries are now spotty, at best.  Sources at the Ministry of Trade (MOT) report that of an estimated USD 2 billion needed to fund the PDS in the first half of 2005, only approximately USD 341 million was allocated and spent with another $250 million promised.  There have been reports of shortages of individual ration products as well as some that are missing completely from the basket.  3. (SBU) Abd' al-Bassit Kareem, the new Iraqi Minister of Trade told us on May 25 (REFTEL C) that many warehouses are empty and deliveries in some areas have not been made in over 2 months.  (NOTE: The Minister's information is not always complete, as evidenced by his statements, reported in REFTEL D, that there were sufficient wheat and rice supplies for June and July.  END NOTE)  Kareem is convinced that close to 40% of Iraq's population has difficulty meeting its food needs without the PDS and tells us that he is committed to reinstating food procurement and distribution as soon as possible.  In a recent USAID food security field assessment, 51% of respondent households in 17 poor districts in Iraq indicated that they either "sometimes" or "often" did not have enough food to eat in January, February, and March 2005.  4. (SBU) To address this problem, Minister Kareem is working closely with the Ministry of Finance to ensure funding for new food procurements as well as reforming internal Ministry processes.  He expects this process to be completed by the end of July.  In the interim, the Minister intends to prepare the public for continuing shortages in food basket products and to make procurements from "reliable suppliers of quality products".  While the Minister understands our concern about the PDS system and our willingness to assist him, he has not invited our participation in closely monitoring the whole system as we did in 2004 (REFTEL A).  5. (SBU) Given that the Minister has been out of Baghdad for the past several weeks (defending his Ph.D. thesis in Kurdistan), we are not sure what actions are being taken to solve these problems above and beyond his statements. Others within the ITG, however, seem to be moving to at least secure wheat, rice, sugar, ghee and pulses for Ramadan in September of this year.  A key test will be current wheat and rice tenders.  ITG reps say they will avoid delays in financing by having funds available to the Ministry of Trade as soon as contracts are awarded.  If this occurs, it will be a significant ITG improvement in the management of the PDS.  In an effort to ensure that essential products of the PDS are delivered in an environment of limited cash flow, the MOT apparently has already decided not to fund some PDS items including soap, detergent and other non-food items.  ------- REFORM -------  6. (SBU) Senior officials in the Iraqi Interim Government (ITG) tell us they remain are disposed to reform the PDS and recognize that this $4 billion burden on the budget is rife with corruption and inefficiency (REFTEL A).  They report that the cost of the actual commodities provided is a fraction of the total $4 billion, which instead goes to distribution and transportation costs, with a significant degree of corruption built in.   Former Deputy Prime Minister and current Planning Minister Barham Saleh has committed to putting PDS reform on the ITG agenda, but in the current political environment both he and Minister Kareem, his former chief of staff and good friend, doubt that large-scale reform is possible.  In a recent discussion with Embassy and USAID representatives Minister Kareem indicated that he saw "no need to reform" the PDS until 2007 because "the reforms are theoretical."  This contradicts the outlook of Dr. Saleh and DPM Chalabi, who indicated that PDS reform is necessary now and should have private sector participation.  7. (SBU) Dr. Said Hakki, Senior Advisor to Prime Minister Ja'afari, told us on June 29 that the government estimates the total PDS food basket costs $50 per person but it is worth closer to $15 by the time it reaches the final consumer.  Dr. Hakki suggested to the PM that the Red Crescent Society, of which he is a member, should manage the PDS program.  According to Hakki, the Society could receive $25 per person and be responsible for delivering $20 of goods to the public, enabling it to use the $5 difference for other humanitarian purposes. He acknowledged however, that this is "just an idea."  ------------------------------------ LIMITED INFORMATION, LIMITED OPTIONS ------------------------------------  8. (SBU) Our current access to information and resources limit our ability to track the PDS as intensively as we did in the past (REFTEL B).  However, we are working with Minister Kareem and Minister Saleh to obtain support for the reinvigoration of plans to carry out two PDS monetization projects, one in the Kurdish North and one in Iraq's South.  During a recent meeting and follow-up correspondence with Minister Kareem, USAID proposed a small pilot monetization project in the North, but the Minister indicated that he sees little use in supporting a pilot project that would give his Ministry data by which they could make policy decisions. Barham Saleh continues to be a proponent, and with both Kareem and Saleh's strong ties to Kurdistan, we will continue to support the pilot monetization project in the North as the most realistic immediate option.  USAID will not move forward without top- level government buy-in.  In addition, close inter- ministerial cooperation will be necessary and may take some time to achieve.  9. (SBU) To that end, at the recent U.S.-E.U. Conference on Iraq in Brussels on June 21-22, 2005 Iraq's Strategic Vision for National Development document clearly states as an objective: "The Government also expects to remove ancillary products included in the PDS basket, as well as implement pilot project for monetization of the PDS's benefits."  Also, they intend to "Enact a social safety net program for the poor and vulnerable, which may extend from reform and monetization of the PDS basket."  Moreover, Iraq's Vision foresees "removing constraints to private sector development...the future engine of job creation and economic diversifications."  This last point is relevant when considering replacing the PDS with a private enterprise driven food system for Iraq.  USAID remains in a position to provide some support for a ITG-led reform program for the PDS.  10. (SBU) Over the past 12 months we have made extensive efforts to combine IRMO, FAS, ECON, FCS, MNF-I and USAID resources to obtain as clear a picture of the PDS system as possible.  The results vary depending on Iraqi cooperation. Although we are often invited to help the MOT "in a pinch" the Iraqis have made it clear that the system is now theirs to manage and theirs to dismantle.  To a great extent, the PDS, as noted above, is dismantling itself.  It continues to fray at the edges with consistent food deliveries replaced by regional shortages of different commodities at any one time.  Prices continue to rise, putting some commodities out of reach for the poorer strata of the population and private traders are without the financing/tools/infrastructure to import foodstuffs into the country.  --------------------------------------------- --------- WHAT CAN WE DO? POST CAPABILITIES AND WHAT MAKES SENSE --------------------------------------------- ---------  11. (SBU) With limited ability to influence ITG actions on the PDS and limited resources at the Embassy; we must target our efforts in the areas where we can affect positive change.  The Iraqi Brussels Vision Statement clearly sets out goals on the PDS that we can support. (PARA 6) These include:  -- Continue to urge the ITG to pursue PDS reform.  By supporting monetization pilots as a first step we will be well placed to continue to push monetization as the first step towards the elimination of the PDS.  We should support the intentions of some in the ITG to limit recipients and/or reduce the number of products that make up the PDS food basket.  -- Identifying funding for USAID/NGO/WFP/ITG nutritional programs for primary school children, pregnant and lactating mothers, and malnourished children and their families.  This will help provide support to vulnerable populations in targeted districts.  We will look for a means by which to expand food security, employment generation, and livelihood improvement programs that either reach or ease the pressure on the 40% of Iraq's population reliant on the PDS for basic necessities.  For example, a World Food Program School Feeding Program is currently 67% under funded and with additional financial support could expand quickly to cover more of Iraq's vulnerable population.  --- Exploring other USG program possibilities.  Title I subsidized loan programs from USDA could also be considered as a short- to medium-term mean by which to provide the ITG with another option to address the needs of those left behind by a failing PDS.  --- Continue to assist the Ministry of Trade when requested.  On several occasions we have been instrumental in facilitating communications between various Ministries involved in the PDS process, obtaining producer and/or contact information, expediting the L/C process or providing training for key players in the PDS contracting and procurement process.  -- Continue to initiate reform dialogue across the ITG, engaging the Ministries of Trade, Planning, and Finance and the office of DPM Chalabi.  --- Continue to monitor the PDS to the best of our ability and share information with the ITG.  Although our resources are limited, we will continue to collect information from a variety of sources and pass it along to the ITG.  12. (U) REOs Basrah, Hillah, Kirkuk, Mosul minimize considered.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002822  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  NEA/I PASS GRAMAGLIA, SILVERMAN, EB/TRA  TAGS: EAIR, PREL, PGOV, ECON, IZ, BAGHDAD SUBJECT: BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT GETS A 24-HOUR REPRIEVE, BUT OUTLOOK STILL NEGATIVE  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED  USG DIST ONLY  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION  REF: BAGHDAD 2804 AND PREVIOUS  1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The July 3 anticipated closure of Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) was delayed for one day as representatives from the Prime Minister's office, Ministry of Transportation (MOT) and security contractor Global Risk Strategies ("Global") agreed to meet on July 4 to attempt to negotiate an alternative that would prevent BIAP's s closure.  In a meeting of all sides today, the PM pledged to support any agreement between the MOT and Global.  The ITG and Global moved further apart in their negotiating positions, however, and agreement tomorrow is very unlikely.  END SUMMARY  2. (SBU) On the morning of July 3, Transitional Prime Minister al-Ja'afari hosted a meeting to discuss Global's security contract at BIAP (REFTELS)  Global country directors Messrs. O'Brien and Mann, the Ministers of the Interior (MOI) and Transportation, the PM's Legal Counsel (Dr. Fadel), the PM's Chief of Staff, and Embassy/IRMO Transportation representatives were present.  The PM pledged that all of Global's "rights" would be respected, however, the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) representatives also made clear that they did not recognize the 12-month contract award Global claims it received in April.  This position represents a complete policy reversal from last week's meeting held with the PM's representatives (REFTELS)  Rather than acknowledge the disputed contract and renegotiate its terms, as agreed to last week, the ITG now seeks to negotiate a 3-month phase-out contract instead.  3. (SBU) The ITG also claims that Global did not have a valid contract from January through March 2005.  In a change from its position on June 25 and June 27, the ITG now says that it will not honor Global's unpaid invoices for March, April and May.  Instead, the MOT wants to negotiate a substantially reduced rate ($1-2 million per month) rather than the $3.7-4.8 million Global invoiced.  4. (SBU) As the discussion became increasingly hostile, the parties moved away from agreement.  PM Ja'afari urged Global to meet directly with the Minister of Transportation and promised to honor any agreement they would make. Apparently, because the MOT is pushing the hardest line, he declared that his Deputy Minister and staff had exceeded their authority when they agreed to pay Global's invoices on June 27.  It is very unlikely that discussions to be held today, July 4, will lead to a negotiated solution.  5. (SBU) The MOI claims their forces could be trained to take over airport security in one month.  The PM's position however is that a three-month transition would be better. The MOI and MOT said they had received other bids to take over airport security (NOTE: We understand that these were solicited rather than merely "received".  END NOTE)  They specifically cited a bid from the firm protecting the Palestine Hotel, for less than $2 million per month.  6. (SBU) After the meeting, Dr. Fadel, the PM's Legal Counsel, admitted that he had deliberately avoided returning Global's calls to set up contract negotiations last week (REFTEL), after it became clear that the ITG would not support the approach agreed upon between Global and the Deputy Minister of Transportation, with the concurrence of PM representatives Said Hakki and Dr. Fadel, on June 27.  7. (SBU) Global plans to meet with the MOT and Dr. Fadel tomorrow, but sees no chance for resolution.  Embassy representatives will also attend.  Global representative Tim O'Brien believes that on July 3 the PM repudiated commitments that his own staff made on his behalf in the June 25 and June 27 meetings and expressed his "contempt" for the resolution process and the people involved.  8. (SBU) After today's meeting, the MOT floated the idea of the USG paying half of Global's arrears.  Per previous COM direction, Embassy representatives replied that the USG would not do so, and that the ITG should not consider it a possible option under any circumstances.  9. (SBU) COMMENT: The Embassy continues to monitor the situation and encourage both sides to come to an agreement that will avoid airport closure.  Global representatives appear to firmly believe that the "good faith" offered last week by the ITG was actually done in "bad faith" as reflected in today's policy reversals.  As such, we remain doubtful that a mutually agreeable solution can be found. Since any new security arrangements put in place in the event of Global's departure would need to be thoroughly vetted before the civilian side of the airport can reopen, we are engaged to ensure that if the airport closes it would not impact our and ITG participation in the July 10- 11 Joint Economic Reconstruction and Economic Development (JCRED) meeting or the July 18-19 IRFFI Meeting in Amman.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002825  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2015 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, KISL, IZ, IR, Sunni Arab, Parliament, National Assembly SUBJECT: SCIRI LEADER HAKIM OFFERS CHARGE ASSURANCES OF FLEXIBILITY ON SUNNI INCLUSION, CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: The leader of the strongest Shia Islamist party, SCIRI's Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, promised rapid progress on Sunni inclusion and offered a moderate vision on an array of constitutional issues in a July 3 meeting with the Charge.  Hakim and Constitution Committee Chairman Humam al-Hamudi, also a SCIRI leader, said they have deep suspicions about the intentions of some of the Sunni nominees.  Nonetheless, they promised the Charge that they would work to see them included by July 4.  Hakim said he supported federalism and thought the danger of Kurdish secession to be overblown.  He laughed at the tortured debate over Iraq's "Arab" identity, considering the matter trivial.  He said he supported keeping Iraq's provincial boundaries intact through the constitution but allowing room for the formation of regional entities that he expected to trisect the nine provinces in the Shia south. He confirmed a flexible view on the issue of religion and state and made clear multiple times that he wanted the constitution to be produced successfully, flexibly, and with active U.S. support.  Hakim warned that a campaign to kill Shia leaders was underway and mused over the idea of establishing public security committees.  Charge shot down that idea flatly, emphasizing U.S. opposition to any militia activity.  Asked for his impressions of Iran's new president, Hakim said he thought Mahmud Ahmadinejad would prove a strong opponent of terror and an unlikely ally of U.S. efforts in Iraq. END SUMMARY  2. (C) SCIRI leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim urged a wider U.S. role in Iraqi affairs in a July 3 meeting with the Charge, pointing to the emerging constitutional debate and stating, "You have a key role -- more important than your role in the government formation process or before that."  SCIRI, he said, is ready to implement and promote new ideas because Iraq needs a wider strategy to fight terror.  "If you like it, do it," Hakim said.  "We are not a research center."  He elaborated on the following key issues:  -- SUNNI CONSTITUTION INCLUSION MOVING FORWARD: Hakim deferred to Constitution Committee Chairman Humam al-Hamudi on the issue.  Hamudi said that the TNA would welcome Sunni Arab nominees into the constitution-drafting process by Monday, July 4.  Hamudi emphasized that he still "had reservations" about both the names and the Sunni Arab request that the TAL not be considered binding in the negotiations. The Kurds remain concerned about Kirkuk's Mujbil Shaykh Issa, and De-Ba'athification issues may still apply to Haseeb Arif al-Obeidi.  Hamudi has clearly lost confidence in his own deputy constitution committee chairman, Adnan al-Janabi, whom he blamed for the nomination of both these men and what he saw as an unnecessarily small number of Iraqi Islamic Party nominees to the committee.  He also made it clear that he sees trouble ahead from these delegates.  "We will bring them into the process for Bush," he said, "but if they block this it's your responsibility." (COMMENT: Constitution Committee members Jalal al-Din al-Sagheer, Sami al-Askari, Hamid Majid Musa, and Mariam al-Rais all echoed this warning in subsequent conversations with Poloff on the margins of the July 3 TNA session but said that induction would take place July 4. END COMMENT)  -- IRAQ'S IDENTITY: Hamudi said that he expected the constitution drafting committee to reach a compromise on the issue of Iraq's Arab identity similar to that in the TAL. The document would read, "The Arabs of Iraq part of the Arab ummah."  Hakim laughed and made it clear he found the whole debate ridiculous.  "Do you really need to say it?" he asked. "It's like saying all humans are sons of Adam." Questioning the importance of the issue, he said, "We do not want to be debating whether Iraq is an Arab nation while people are being killed in the streets." Constitution Committee member and independent Islamist Abd al-Hadi Muhammad Said al-Hakim, who also attended the meeting, mentioned that another compromise formula under consideration would have the constitution declare, "Iraq is part of two worlds, the Islamic world and the Arab world."  -- AN EARLY CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE WITH SUNNIS: Hamudi noted that he had met with National Dialogue Council leader Salah Mutlak under the auspices of a meeting with UN SRSG Ashraf Qazi on July 1.  Hamudi said they clashed over the issue of federalism.  Mutlak was opposed to the idea, Hamudi said, and wanted the committee to draft a temporary document, akin to another TAL, rather than a full-fledged constitution.  Hamudi said that he and Mutlak were both in agreement that Iraq needed a parliamentary system of government.  Mutlak, Hamudi said with suspicion, appears to want to join the constitution drafting process under any circumstances.  -- RELIGION AND STATE: Hamudi, consistent with past statements on the subject, said that the constitution will handle the issue of religion and state much like the TAL did.   -- DIVIDING RESOURCES UNDER FEDERALISM: Hakim said he saw no problem with any of several approaches to dividing state resources, all as long as the process were done in a way that is "balanced."  Regions could own their resources, the central government could own them, or a percentage could be worked out to divide them.  Hakim wondered whether opening the ownership of resources up to the provinces might create more disputes than it resolves, particularly as multiple provinces move to claim assets that overlap their borders. We asked how the system could be balanced if not all parts of the country have the same resource base or even regional governments yet.  Hakim took the point and did not argue. (COMMENT:  we sense the issue of natural resource revenues is one that requires considerable additional thought and discussion among Iraqis.  END COMMENT)  -- LEAVING INTERNAL BORDERS OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT: Echoing Hamudi's view on the subject, Hakim said he believed that Iraq's new internal borders should not be drawn by the constitution.  Instead, Iraq should continue to be governed according to its provincial system, allowing the three Kurdish provinces in the north to continue their arrangement.  The remaining 15 provinces would be free to form regional entities with the agreement of parliament and their populations.  Asked for his vision of such entities, Hakim said he expected southern provinces to form three regional entities of three provinces each.  For instance, one entity might include Najaf, Karbala, and Babil.  Another could include Basra, Muthanna and Dhi Qar.  A third might join Wasit, Maysan, and Qadisiyya.  -- HOLDING FUTURE ELECTIONS BY PROVINCIAL LINES: Hakim said he hoped future elections would divide the 275 seats of the National Assembly among the provinces to ensure proper regional representation.  Using the population statistics from the food-ration card system could provide at the proportion of seats for each region.  -- ON KURDISH SECESSION: Hakim said he was not worried about the possibility of Kurdish secession from Iraq.  Speaking as if the Kurds were in front of him, he said, "If you want to secede, secede.  We the Shia have nothing to lose.  Starting a country unaccepted by the Islamic world would be a problem, however." (Note:  PUK leader and Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Fu'ad Ma'asum has also made of point of clearly dismissing the possibility of Kurdish secession in conversations with Poloff about the constitution process. "How could we withdraw?" he has said. "If we had a port it would be another story, but we are a landlocked nation."  End Note)  -- LOOKING FOR MORE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Hakim complained, with the support of his colleagues, that the U.S. has not taken sufficient action to provide provincial councils with resources.  Hamudi specifically recommended moving forward with development in stable provinces as a way of showing restive areas the price of terrorism.  Abd al-Hadi al-Hakim noted that, contrary to such an approach, electricity is currently better in strife-ridden Ramadi than it is in the comparatively calm province of Najaf.  Charge and PolCouns described the major steps being taken in the PRDC process to address these concerns.  -- RAISING THE IDEA OF PROVINCIAL PROTECTION COMMITTEES: Hakim complained that a major effort was underway to target senior figures in the Shia community.  The two most recent examples of this campaign were the assassination last week of TNA member Shaykh Dhari al-Fayad, a SCIRI ally and important tribal leader, as well as the killing of Sistani Representative Kamal al-Din al-Guraifi.  Hakim said books were being distributed in the country defaming the Shia religion, declaring both its practitioners and those who do not denounce the Shia as "infidels."  Hakim said he supported the formation of public security committees and he claimed was modeling the idea on British public defense programs. Charge responded flatly that the U.S. rejected any militia formation and activity in the country.  Hakim protested that these would not be militias but he did not pursue the point.  -- IRAN'S NEW PRESIDENT: Hakim described the newly elected Iranian president Mahmud Ahmadinejad to be a "good, well-known man."  Hakim noted in passing he had quickly dispatched an envoy to Teheran and subsequently spoke on the telephone with Ahmadinejad on July 2.  Hakim said he was not personally acquainted with Ahmedinejad because the man had risen to prominence following his own departure from Iran in 2003.  Hakim said Ahmedinejad's election took place in circumstances similar to Khatami's:  both men were elected because the public rebelled against the candidate perceived to be the "government's choice."  In Khatami's case the citizens rebelled against Shaykh Natiq Nuri, and in Ahmadinejad the rebellion was against Rafsanjani.  Hakim said he was pleased with what he had heard form Ahmadinejad's point of view so far, noting that the man "does not have a complex about the people of Iraq."  He has made clear, Hakim said, that he opposes terrorism in Iraq.  Hamudi jumped in to state that Ahmadinejad would not cause problems for the U.S. in Iraq.  Hakim said all sides would do well to focus on the shared American-Iranian interests in Iraq rather than allow disputes in the American-Iranian bilateral relationship to put the two sides in conflict here.  3. (C) COMMENT: Al-Hakim was relaxed and cordial but interestingly Hamudi spoke almost as much as he.  Hakim's desire to see the U.S. and Iran find a modus vivendi was evident; he and Hamudi recognize the hazards to them and their freedom of maneuver should American-Iranian conflicts be played out in Iraq.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July. 5 were preparations for drafting the constitution and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Do not leave us to fight terrorism alone" (Al-Bayyna, 7/5) B. "Normalizing the situation in Kirkuk is an Iraqi affair and a legal commitment" (Al-Ittihad, 7/27)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Do not leave us to fight terrorism alone" (Al-Bayyna, 7/5)  Al-Bayyna (affiliated with Hezbollah in Iraq) published a front-page editorial about the recent calls for the foreign troops to leave Iraq:  "The withdrawal of the multi-national forces from Iraq has become a point of contention between the government, political parties, and those calling for the occupiers to leave Iraq. During his recent tour abroad, Al-Jafari confirmed that Iraq is facing a fierce terrorist threat that is targeting its democratic experiment. The Prime Minister demanded more financial support because it is opposing terrorism on behalf of the entire world. Al-Jafari also stated that the Iraqi people are sacrificing all they have in order to defend humanity. The world must come to realize this fact and the donor counties must help Iraq during the current exceptional circumstances.  At the same time, Al-Jafari warned of the possible failure of Iraq's democratic experiment and claimed that such a failure would have adverse consequences for the entire world. He indicated that the danger of terrorism would threaten all capitals of the world and endanger all democracies. We must stress that the Iraqi democratic experiment represents a dramatic transformation in a region whose nations have suffered from dictatorship, suppression of freedoms, and the confiscation of opinion and willpower. These countries are now carefully observing the Iraqi democratic experiment, which is plagued by both internal and external terrorism. This experiment is surrounded by neighboring countries which are supporting, feeding, and encouraging terrorism in Iraq. These countries are recruiting killers, mercenaries, and brainwashed individuals in order to send them to Iraq to make the democratic experiment fail. The fate of these countries, however, will be worse than the Iraqi destiny, which is protected by American tanks and multi-national forces.  If we are looking to evaluate the Iraqi situation as a whole, we must stress the fact that the destabilization of the security situation is an international act. The terrorism is only aimed at making the democratic experiment fail in Iraq in order to bring Saddam's regime back to power. Recent calls demanding the departure of multi- national forces must realize that the Iraqi security forces must be capable of filling the security vacuum after the foreign troops' withdrawal. A hasty withdrawal will only lead to sectarian and civil conflicts, thereby giving the Baathists, Saddamists, and Salafists an opportunity to restore power. Such a scenario will lead to the eradication of the Shiite majority in Iraq. Indeed, making a rash decision regarding the withdrawal of multi-national forces will come at a great cost to the Iraqi people. We do not want a sectarian regime to be established in Iraq. We want to build a democratic system that is built on equal rights and responsibilities. Only then will the Iraqi people be able to protect their experiment and their own lives."  B. "Normalizing the situation in Kirkuk is an Iraqi affair and a legal commitment" (Al-Ittihad, 7/27)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK) published a third-page column by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about the Kirkuk issue:  "Included in Article 58 of the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) is a paragraph that establishes the Higher Commission for Solving Real Estate and Property Claims. Therefore, Al-Jafari's government must work diligently to activate this commission and allocate special funding so that it can accomplish the normalization of the situation in Kirkuk.  The agreement between the UIA and the Kurdish list stated that the former regime's policies in Kirkuk must end. These policies included displacing Kirkuk's original citizens and replacing them with Arab outsiders. The first paragraph of this agreement calls for expediting the normalization of the situation in Kirkuk and other areas that are under dispute according to the TAL. The agreement also states that the government must allocate the appropriate amount of funds to accomplish this process of normalization. Therefore, the government must now apply the first four sections of the TAL's Article 58, Paragraph A. These sections state that the government must activate normalization procedures within one month after its establishment.  We believe that these articles and paragraphs are clear. Without a doubt, Al-Jafari is very familiar with these articles and paragraphs. As Prime Minister, it must be his priority to implement what was agreed upon in the TAL. It is not beneficial for Al-Jafari to surprise everyone by asking for a postponement in solving the Kirkuk issue. He must consult with the Presidency Council and National Assembly before making such unilateral decisions. The Prime Minister should also call for a meeting to be held between the UIA and the Kurdish Coalition to discuss this issue. Al-Jafari's call for postponement has come at a sensitive and complicated time. The government must demonstrate to the Iraqi people that it is working to calm the situation, not to create more tension."  SATTERFIELD

BAGHDAD 2760      B. BAGHDAD 1681  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert S. Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1. (C/REL GBR, AUS) SUMMARY: Iraqi Correctional Service (ICS) Deputy Director General Nadhem Reshid Jebur told EmbOffs during a June 28 visit to the Rusafa men's prison in Baghdad that ICS is serious about instilling a culture of respect for human rights within its organization.  New employees are screened and receive extensive human rights training, and special programs exist to help long term employees overcome the 'Saddam mentality.' There are several mechanisms available to prisoners to report allegations of abuse, including the Internal Affairs Unit and human rights ombudsmen who are resident in each facility, and ICS social workers.  Nadhem stated that prison capacity is insufficient and worried how ICS will accommodate the proposed transfer of MNF detainees.  Conditions at Rusafa, which is considered by Nadhem and DOJ advisors to be a model facility, are good.  However, medical staff reported that the majority of prisoners they examine upon intake display some sign of 'trauma,' which the prisoners claim is perpetrated by the police.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- --- INSTILLING A CULTURE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS --------------------------------------------- ---  2. (C/REL GBR, AUS) During a June 28 visit to Baghdad's Rusafa prison, Deputy Director General Nadhem Reshid Jebur told EmbOffs that creating a culture of human rights within the ICS continues to be a priority at the highest levels of ICS management.  He noted that there is a lack of understanding -- both among ICS personnel and inmates -- about what freedom really entails, as well as how to meld human rights with the law. Nonetheless, ICS officials continue to emphasize human rights and are working to eradicate the 'Saddam mentality' from its ranks.  3. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Nadhem said there are several mechanisms in place to facilitate this shift.  New employees are given psychological exams, he said, to help determine their propensity for engaging in abusive behavior.  He also said that approximately one-half of the six-week course for new employees comprises human rights training.  Employees who were part of ICS under the former regime also receive special training and attention.  Nadhem estimated the effectiveness of programs targeting these employees to be approximately 70 percent and admitted that some reluctance remains among them to implement international human rights standards. Those employees who continue to resist the new, human rights-oriented approach are either moved to different facilities or receive some form of administrative punishment.  4. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Nadhem noted that the Ministry of Human Rights (MoHR) has been actively engaged with ICS.  Some facilities have embedded MoHR employees, as does Rusafa, and all have a human rights ombudsman -- an ICS employee.  In addition to the ICS' Internal Affairs Unit that investigates abuse complaints, there is a board comprising Ministry of Justice (MoJ), MoHR and Ministry of Interior (MoI) representatives that reviews allegations of prisoner abuse. (NOTE: It was not clear if Nadhem meant that there is one board that investigates abuse allegations or if the boards are specific to each facility.  END NOTE.)  Nadhem emphasized that ICS has a very good relationship with Saad Hussein, who oversees the MoHR team that is responsible for monitoring prisons.  5. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Prisoners have an additional mechanism for reporting incidents of abuse, said Nadhem.  There are 460 ICS social workers, similar to caseworkers in the U.S. model, to whom each prisoner is assigned.  According to Nadhem, the social workers meet with prisoners daily, emphasizing that they (prisoners) are vocal in reporting any mistreatment by ICS staff. (COMMENT: During a tour of the facility, one prisoner expressed his unhappiness to PolOff that condensation from the air conditioner was dripping onto his mattress.  He did not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity to complain to visitors, nor did he show any hint of fear that he would be punished for doing so.  Prison officials seemed equally nonplussed as they explained to PolOff what the inmate was complaining about.  END COMMENT.)  -------------------------- LACK OF CAPACITY WORRISOME --------------------------  6. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Nadhem told EmbOffs that the biggest problem currently facing ICS is capacity. He worried that ICS would be overwhelmed should the Iraqi Government take custody of MNF detainees as proposed.  For example, he said, Rusafa 1 has the capacity for 396 prisoners and currently houses 378. However, he was expecting to intake 70 additional prisoners into the facility.  (NOTE: MNF's proposal for the transition of detention operations is premised on Iraqi ownership of current Coalition detention facilities and the Coalition-funded training of at least 2,000 additional correctional personnel.  However, MNF is concerned that the number of detainees may significantly increase due to ongoing operations.  END NOTE.) The problem of overcrowding is exacerbated by the lack of a classification system.  Although there is some attempt to separate hardened criminals from other offenders, this does not occur in a systematic fashion.  7. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Rehabilitation programs, such as vocational training, are needed, but, according to Nadhem, the space problem is so dire that it simply is not currently possible.  (NOTE: some vocational training is planned for Rusafa, as well as for other prisons on a limited basis.  For example, 150 welding machines will be distributed to prisons, including 30 directly to Kurdistan, and last year, the USG provided sewing machines to the women's prison in Kadamiyah.  END NOTE.)  Nadhem pointed out that there are prisons from which Saddam emptied prisoners just prior to liberation that could be renovated to accommodate an influx of prisoners and alleviate current capacity problems.  However, there are 'squatters' in many of these structures, and it would be difficult to move them out.  Additionally, this would be a long-term project he said, but a solution is needed now.  (NOTE:  Two prisons are currently under construction.  It is estimated that they will be completed by March/April 2006.  The complex at Nasariya is a super maximum facility that will have 1,200 beds and house one prisoner per cell.  The Khan Bani Sa'ad prison is a high security facility that will have 1,800 beds.  END NOTE.)  ---------------------- PRISON CONDITIONS GOOD ----------------------  8. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Rusafa is a prison for men and has a contingent of 16 DOJ prison advisors.  The newer modules, which have recently been constructed, are clean, air-conditioned, and meet U.S.-formulated international standards (25 square feet per person) for space.  There are toilets in each cell, and inmates are issued orange jumpsuits, a mattress, and linens at intake.  All the cells are barracks-style. The older modules were constructed over 20 years ago, but their exact age is unknown.  The largest cells in those modules house up to 80 prisoners and utilize air coolers.  Prisoners are allowed regular access to their lawyers, and male and female visitors are assigned separate visiting days. Visitors communicate with the prisoners through wire barriers.  Prisoners are provided at least one hour per day for physical activity -- sometimes more -- and pray either in their cells or in the exercise yard.  9. (C/REL GBR, AUS) The Rusafa complex houses a health unit that employs four physicians and two dentists.  Physicians staff the facility from 8:30 AM until 2:30 PM, and medics are on call after office hours.  According to the medical staff, all prisoners receive a medical examination at intake, and respiratory ailments tend to be the biggest medical problem.  However, staff also said that the majority of prisoners they screen show evidence of 'trauma' that the prisoners claim is perpetrated by the police.  Just prior to EmbOff's visit, medical staff sent a new prisoner to the hospital for treatment.  According to the prisoner, the police were responsible for his leg, which had been broken in two places.  (NOTE:  In a separate conversation, DOJ advisor to the health unit confirmed that the majority of prisoners transferred by the police exhibit signs of abuse.  END NOTE.)  10. (C/REL GBR, AUS) The prison complex is exempt from the limitations on electricity usage, but still has frequent outages.  Additionally, Rusafa is experiencing problems with sewage backups near the food preparation area.  Although there has been no indication thus far that these backups have resulted in health problems, there is concern about the possible degradation of food preparation standards at the facility.  ------- COMMENT -------  11. (C/REL GBR, AUS) Overall, the conditions at Rusafa are surprisingly good.  It is clean, operations appear to be orderly, and inmate living spaces are generally clean and well kept.  According to both Nadhem and DOJ advisors, Rusafa is considered to be a model facility and conditions there are generally better than in Iraq's other prisons -- especially in the South.  While there are problems, what we saw was consistent with what MoHR has told us (reftels) about the conditions in ICS facilities.  However, it is unlikely that Rusafa would have met international U.S. and UN standards without the DOJ and ICITAP advisor presence there. MoJ's increased focus on human rights is clearly evident in the conditions of this prison, and Rusafa is a prime example of the difference that focused attention, resources, and experience can make on Iraq's infrastructure.

Satterfield for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (U) Deputy Speaker Husayn Shahristani announced the expansion of the constitution drafting committee at the July 4 session of the Transitional National Assembly (TNA).  The announcement amounted to an induction for the 15 Sunni Arabs and one Sabean nominated from outside the Assembly to join the constitution drafting process as core members.  Thirteen other Sunni Arabs nominated as expert advisors are also now free to begin their work.  Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Adnan al-Janabi confirmed the announcement in a press conference he held during a break in the TNA session.  2. (U) The TNA Constitution Drafting Committee and additional representatives will work together as equal members in the "Supreme Commission for the Drafting of the Constitution," according to the announcement. The additional Sunni Arabs and one Sabean, Subhi Mubarak Mal Allah, are set to meet the original members of the constitution committee on July 5 to get to know one other and receive a report on the work completed to date.  The new members will be given the opportunity to re-open items for discussion and distribute themselves among the committee's six committees. Constitution Committee Chairman Humam Hamudi told reporters July 5 that he did not want this new step to prevent the committee from meeting its August 15 deadline.  "We hope that the new participation of those who did not participate in the elections will not obstruct the work of the committee or slow it," he said, "so we have arranged a set of intensive meetings to continue the work."  ------- Comment -------  3. (C)  Yesterday's announcement is a big step forward for Sunni outreach and comes after heavy engagement from the U.S. and British governments.  We have seen media reports that two of the 15 new Sunni Arab full committee members, and one of the thirteen Sunni Arab consultants, have withdrawn.  Our contacts among the Sunni Arabs tell us that they are trying to ensure all members named on the list stay on the committee.  4.  (C)  The reservations that held up the inclusion of the 28 Sunnis, however, have by no means vanished.  We will have to watch all parties to the process closely to make sure the announcement today is implemented fairly.  The de-Ba'athification investigation that delayed the induction has not ended.  The Shia and Kurds could well place it like a gun on the table to scare obstructionist Sunni Arab representatives into line.  Hamudi has also said that the committee will continue holding open weekly meetings with Sunni Arab leaders and others who are not on the committee but wish to hear updates on its work and contribute their views.  The attendees at those meetings will clearly form a pool of alternate members that the committee can pull in should some of the new representatives withdraw in protest. Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Fuad Ma'asum, deeply suspicious that the new inductees have entered only to withdraw, told Poloff that he was moving forward with plans to crown the constitution drafting process with a "Constitutional Conference" that draws in notables from across Iraqi society to approve the final document with a show of unanimity.  5.

Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1. (SBU) The Transitional National Assembly followed a day of rancorous discussion over the MNF-I presence in Iraq with a decision on July 4 to form a "Sovereignty Committee" to address the issue of foreign forces in Iraq.  The new committee will aim to engage both the Iraqi government and MNF-I on the disposition of foreign forces in Iraq.  Sadrists opposed to the presence of coalition forces have led this effort, but the majority of those who voted for the committee were simply angry that the Jafari government conducted the one-year review of UNSCR 1546 without consulting the legislature.  The committee will be composed of the heads of Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees as well as the heads of the parliament's main blocs.  2. (C/REL GBR, AUS) COMMENT: Leading PUK member Fuad Ma'asum and others have downplayed the significance of the committee to us.  The issue, they have emphasized, is more about the relationship between Iraq's budding legislature and executive than it is about the relationship between Iraqis and MNF-I forces.  Ma'asum told Poloff, "When you don't want to take action about something in politics you form a committee."  The issue nevertheless warrants close analysis.  We will hold meetings with new committee members and report more thoroughly as more information becomes available and the committee convenes.  3.

(C) On Sunday, June 3, 2005, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and FBI Counterterrorism Assistant Director Willie Hulon met with senior MNF-I and Embassy officials, Department of Justice and FBI personnel, Iraq's Prime Minister, senior Iraqi justice leaders, and US military forces recovering at the International Zone's Combat Support Hospital. Reports on the Attorney General's and Mr. Hulon's meetings with Iraqi government officials follow.  ------------------------------------ WORKING JUSTICE LUNCH AT THE EMBASSY ------------------------------------  2.  (C) After a brief delay at Baghdad International Airport occasioned by a morning sandstorm, the Attorney General and Mr. Hulon arrived in the International Zone and attended a working lunch with Minister of the Interior Jabr, Chief Justice Medhat, and Judge Jamal, President of the Iraqi Special Tribunal. The lunch was held at the Embassy Annex and hosted by the Charge d'Affaires.  3.  (C) The Attorney General opened by expressing his gratitude to be in Iraq and his congratulations for the work being done to build democracy in Iraq, the success of which is, he noted, important for the United States as well as the Iraqi people.  The Department of Justice has been working in Iraq since 2003, he said, and he is personally committed to the dedication of DOJ resources, especially given the difficulty of achieving democracy without rule-of-law.  4.  (C) At this point, the Attorney General introduced Maxwell Wood, the US Attorney in Macon, Georgia, who will arrive soon in Baghdad as the new head of DOJ's Iraq delegation, and expressed his "total confidence" in his new delegate.  5. (C) Judge Medhat welcomed the Attorney General on behalf of the Supreme Juridical Council, and spoke briefly about developments in the Iraqi justice system, which is now, he said, fully integrated, with the courts reaching out to all government services to involve them in the establishment of rule-of-law and democracy in Iraq.  He explained that for the first time, the MOI and the Supreme Council are working together, side-by-side, in all sectors.  6.  (C) The Minister of the Interior noted that he wished the Attorney General had more time to spend in Iraq to observe the workings of the MOI and MOJ, and said he took pride in the independence of Iraqi justice. Three days ago, he noted, he had received an order to arrest an Iraqi Police Commando leader - and that while he had been hesitant to enforce the judge's order, he had to respect the rule-of-law.  7.  (C) The conversation turned to specific issues of interest to the Attorney General, including the long- term prospects of Coalition detainees in Iraq, the protection of Iraqi judges, and the President's personal interest in the investigation and prosecution of high-profile cases, including kidnapping and assassination, committed against Iraqi government officials.  8. (C) On the last point, the Attorney General stressed the importance of these investigations for rule-of-law, noted his support for a joint task force of US and Iraqi investigators and prosecutors, and said that the USG "wanted to do whatever we can to help develop professional police, prosecutor, and judicial systems".  9.  (C) Judge Medhat thanked the Attorney General for his generous offer, and noted that while MNF-I had given "a lot" and MOI had put forward great effort, the Iraqi justice system is still in need of assistance, including financial assistance for 800 Iraqi judges who require personal security details. What the Iraqi justice system has accomplished so far is, Judge Medhat said, greater than that Iraqi recources alone would have enabled given the Iraqis to achieve given their "brotherly coalition" with MNF-I.  10.  (C) A discussion of corruption was sparked by the Attorney General's query, to the assembled, of which posed a greater danger to Iraq - corruption, or the insurgency. Both, replied the Minister of the Interior, but the insurgency had to be tackled first. Judge Medhat suggested that corruption contributed to the insurgency, and that defeating one would help defeat the other.  11.  (C) The Minister of the Interior followed with a summary of the current state of the insurgency, which he traced to foreign terrorists entering Iraq from neighboring countries, and members of the old regime. Iraq needs the support of neighboring states, especially Syria, to stop foreigners from coming in, he said. As for the members of the old regime, he believes they would be able to get rid of these elements quickly - except for the recent rise in suicide bombers.  12.  (C) The fight in Iraq, the Minister said, is a fight with international terrorism, and the whole world should stand and fight -- which is what happened in Brussels. The Minister then thanked the USG and American people for their assistance in Iraqi governance, democracy, and elections, and noted that these developments in Iraq are starting to affect neighboring countries whose governments are "afraid of freedom".  13.  (C) Attention turned to the President of the Iraqi Special Tribunal, who provided an update on the tribunal's status, saying that investigations were taking place in the proper manner, and that the tribunal remained independent of the government. Judge Jamal concluded by requesting USG assistance in procuring apartments in the International Zone for IST judges. "My judges are courageous", he said, "but safety is also good."  --------------------------------------------- ----- THE IRAQI PRIME MINISTER AND ATTORNEY GENERAL MEET --------------------------------------------- -----  14.  (C) PM Ja'afari opened the meeting by welcoming AG Gonzalez, saying that he had enjoyed fruitful meetings with the President, SecState, and National Security Adviser several days earlier in Washington. The AG commended Ja'afari's progress in promoting democracy and the rule of law in Iraq, noting that the birth of a democracy can be difficult, but that it is impossible without the rule of law.  The AG expressed his personal commitment to Ja'afai and the Iraqi government to provide whatever help DOJ could, including advice, training, and resources.  15.  (C) Ja'afari, again demonstrating his interest in U.S. history, quizzed the AG on the two former U.S. presidents who had died on July 4.  He discussed the fact that the U.S. constitution had evolved since its inception, and noting the number of amendments throughout its history.  Ja'afari noted that he wanted a constitution for all Iraqis, not just for the majority or just for the minority.  He emphasized that the diversity of Iraq was even greater than that of the United States, but suggested that Iraq would start -- with the equal rights of women and minorities, and the acceptability of intermarriage -- where the U.S. constitution and laws ended up.  He spoke briefly of the need to include in the Iraqi constitution a recognition that the majority of Iraqis are Muslim.  16.  (C) Ja'afari took the opportunity to articulate Iraq's need for a constitutional awareness campaign, noting that he hoped to get the Iraqi citizens to a certain level of understanding about the process and content of the constitution.  He spoke of collecting points of view from different sectors and people, also noting that he wanted to achieve the draft constitution by August 15. 17.  (C) AG Gonzalez introduced to PM Ja'afari the new Justice Attache, Mr. Wood, who assumes his post at the Embassy in a week.  The AG also raised the USG's concern about the long-term issue of detainees in Iraq and how the Iraqis might eventually assume detention responsibilities for individuals it is unable to charge under its criminal laws.  PM Ja'afari seemed to focus on those held by MNF-I against whom criminal charges can be brought; when the AG noted that the concern was with those Iraq could not charge criminally, the PM mentioned that Iraq could get "guarantors" for the detainees, prohibit them from leaving the country, and so on.  (Comment: The Prime Minister does not seem to have given much thought to this problem, including its scope or possible solutions.  End comment.)  18.  (C) Ja'afari concluded the meeting with a discussion of terrorism in Iraq; both he and the AG agreed that Iraq was on the front lines of the war on terrorism.  The PM noted that the Iraqi people have two pictures of the American presence in Iraq.  On the one hand, they see the positive diplomatic presence, which is evidenced by the fact that people wave at the helicopters they see flying overhead.  On the other hand, they see innocent people killed for taking a misstep or making a sudden move in a car.  Ja'afari cautioned that MNF-I needed to be sensitive in dealing with Iraqi civilians and look into events in which civilians were injured or killed by MNF-I forces.  In conclusion, Ja'afari mentioned that he had visited wounded U.S. soldiers while he was in Washington and that America should be proud that it has children who came to Iraq to fight against oppression.  19.  (C) This cable was not cleared by the Attorney General prior to his departure. Satterfield

END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Do you believe us now?" (Al-Bayyan, 7/6) B. "What are the Arab League representatives doing in Iraq?" (Al-Adala, 7/6)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Do you believe us now?" (Al-Bayyan, 7/6)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with Islamic Ad-Da'wa Party, led by Al-Jafari) published a third-page editorial by Rasool Salim about terrorism in Iraq:  "We have always declared that terrorism cannot be restricted to one country. The perpetrators of terrorism can easily cross borders and spread fear into other countries. What is the view of the neighboring countries with regard to these facts? Up until now, we are not aware of their official positions. In fact, some of these countries have continued to support terrorist groups by facilitating their infiltration into Iraq. This situation proves that these countries have not listened to the Iraqi demands. We do not intend here to criticize the nature of any country's position on terrorism. However, we regret those attitudes that do not care about the shedding of innocent Iraqi blood.  It has become normal for these countries not to condemn any terrorist operation in Iraq while strongly condemning such operations that occur in other countries. This double-faced policy has become well known. We have declared more than once that terrorism in Iraq will affect everyone, without exception. Today, these countries have become targets for terrorist operations, which have included explosions and assassinations. In response, these countries have begun enacting strict measures against the armed groups whom they refer to as "terrorists" - despite the fact they refer to the same groups in Iraq as the "resistance."  We hope that these countries will begin to cooperate seriously with Iraq in order to eradicate the region from terrorism. We are growing tired of calling for action without ever seeing any tangible results. However, we will repeat our declaration once more that terrorism will not spare anyone. For this reason, these countries must cooperate and we must work together to dispose of terrorism. We realize that these countries do not like the Iraqi people, but they better begin cooperating for the sake of their own security. Had they only listened to our first warning, the terrorists would not have succeeded in targeting their capitals. Unfortunately, they did not believe us."  B. "What are the Arab League representatives doing in Iraq?" (Al-Adala, 7/6)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a last-page editorial by Muhammad Al-Abdullah about the Arab countries' role in Iraq:  "Iraqi security forces have often discovered foreign passports hidden in terrorist safe-houses. The presence of such documentation indicates that the Arab League actually does have representation in Iraq because such passports have been found in Al-Qa'im, Karabila, Mosul, Falluja, Latifiyya, and Mada'en. Therefore, the Arab League is present in Iraq through their unofficial representatives who have infiltrated into Iraq illegally. It is possible that the Arab League's official representatives are aware of such infiltration but have intentionally chosen to ignore it.  These foreign terrorists are entering Iraq's border crossings not to expel the occupier but to kill innocent Iraqis. There are even certain cities that are specializing in recruiting terrorists and sending them quickly on the path to heaven. Supposedly, the terrorists' fastest way to heaven is to detonate a car bomb near a restaurant filled with innocent Iraqis. These terrorists are also following Al-Zarqawi's instructions by targeting Shiite areas. Unfortunately, it appears that the Arab countries are gathering to kill our people. Al-Zarqawi, the hateful Arab media, and official and unofficial Arab League representatives have enlarged the Iraqi wound to the point of damaging the bone.  Syria recently announced that it was sending a diplomat to Iraq to investigate the Iraqi claims concerning terrorist infiltrations into Iraq from Syria. However, I do not understand why the Syrian security forces are capable of catching an infiltrator entering Syrian lands while they are incapable of discovering thousands of infiltrators entering Iraq from their territory. What are Saudis, Jordanians, Libyans, Moroccans, and other Arab League representatives doing at the Syrian-Iraqi border towns of Al-Bukmal and Al-Qamishly? Have these two cities suddenly become tourist destinations? We call on our Arab brothers to stop this yellow death emanating from their lands. We are tired of using the language of diplomacy. Our Arab brothers remind us of the old proverb that states, "You claim that you are strong like a lion when you face me, but in times of war, you are merely an ostrich."  SATTERFIELD

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY.  Contacts at a number of foreign missions in Baghdad condemn the recent spate of kidnappings and assassination attempts against Arab diplomats in Baghdad. They believe these actions are likely part of the insurgency's and Al-Qaeda's campaign to undermine the Iraqi government and intimidate other foreign missions in Iraq. Some foreign officials believe Iraq security adequately protects them; others claim the quality of protection is inadequate.  None, however, plan to close down.  The UAE ambassador believes these recent incidents signal the desperation of the insurgency following recent security initiatives against them. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C/NF) Contacts at a number of foreign missions in Baghdad have all condemned the rash of kidnappings and assassination attempts against Arab diplomats in Baghdad. The Syrian Embassy refused to comment, however.  Some embassies think these actions are part of the insurgency's and Al-Qaeda's campaign to discredit the Iraqi government and force the closure of Arab embassies in Iraq.  According to an AP web report, Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the July 2 kidnapping of Egyptian Charge, Ambassador Ihab al Sherif.  However, to date no entity has claimed ownership of the July 5 attacks on Bahraini Charge Hasan al-Ansari and Pakistani Ambassador Yunis Khan.  A summary of reactions from the Bahraini, Pakistani, Lebanese, Lebanese, United Arab Emirates, Syrian, and Tunisian embassies follows:  ---------------------------------------- Bahraini Embassy - Attack was Deliberate ----------------------------------------  3.  (C) Ambassador Hasan told us from his hospital bed July 6 that he was on his way from his home to the Embassy, located down the street from his residence, when two vehicles approached him.  The occupants of one vehicle opened fire on his vehicle with a round of at least ten bullets.  He ducked to avoid the fire, but one bullet struck him in his right upper arm.  Ambassador Hasan said the car was "filled with blood" from the wound.  He made his way to the police station nearby; the police took him to the Iraqi hospital for emergency care.  Ambassador Hasan is certain this was a well-planned assassination attempt on his life, noting surveillance of his residence the day before and the lack of police who usually guarded the street the day of the incident.  He will be medivaced within a few days to Bahrain or Amman.  Hasan was uncertain what plans the Bahraini government has for his mission in Baghdad.  --------------------------------------------- --- Pakistani Embassy Makes Do with Private Security --------------------------------------------- ---  4. (C) Irfan Shawkat, Third Secretary at the Embassy of Pakistan in Baghdad, told PolOff July 6 that the Pakistani Ambassador has a private security company protecting him.  In addition, Iraqi security forces (ISF) are providing some support to protect the embassy itself, but not the diplomats.   --------------------------------------------- -------- Lebanese Comments --------------------------------------------- --------  5. (C) Lebanese DCM Hasan Hijazi, who has been in Iraq since 2001, strongly condemned the recent attack on the Bahraini and Pakistani Ambassadors.  He also wished for the Egyptian Ambassador's prompt release and safe return to his family. Hijazi said the purpose behind these attacks and kidnappings is to undermine the new government and to intimidate other diplomatic missions in Iraq.  When asked to describe the current situation, Hijazi said, "Very dangerous; everyone is afraid to venture into the 'Red Zone' these days."  Hijazi has halted all "Red Zone" moves and is not leaving his embassy.  Hijazi added that his embassy has its own security and the Iraqi government has provided additional security personnel.  6. (C) To Hijazi, Iraqi security was not adequately qualified, however.  "Quality not quantity is what matters when the insurgents are attacking with heavy arms and personnel," opined Hijazi.  Asked what plans the Lebanese Embassy has if the security situation worsens, he replied they have no plans to close the embassy, that the matter required further discussion in Beirut and other Arab nations capitals.  ----------------------------- Syrian Embassy Has No Comment -----------------------------  7. (C) A Syrian Embassy employee who answered the MCI phone registered to a Abdul Hakeem Sy Ali was reluctant to discuss the incidents, replying that the Syrian Embassy has no oral or written comment on the events.  He then promptly hung up.   --------------------------------------------- --- UAE Embassy Believes Al-Qaeda Behind the Actions --------------------------------------------- ---  8. (C) United Arab Emirates:  Ambassador Ali Alkabi told PolOff July 6 that these attacks are normal in a war zone. He believes al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in Iraq are behind these acts.  However, Alkabi attributed the kidnapping of the Egyptian ambassador and the assassination attempt on the Bahraini ambassador to their own security negligence. Alkabi noted that the Egyptian and Bahraini diplomats constantly travel into the "Red Zone" without appropriate security personnel or protection, which makes them easy targets.  He added that increased attacks on the diplomatic missions are "to pressure their relationships with the Iraqi government."  9. (C) Alkabi said the UAE has improved its embassy's security measures and they have had no problems with the Iraqi army or Iraqi security forces.  Alkabi noted that other missions should be more careful, avoid unnecessary travel, cooperate and coordinate with the Iraqi army and security forces.  The Ambassador said he has no plans to reduce his embassy staff at the moment.  Alkabi opined that, in general, the security situation in Iraq has improved significantly. Due to the recent Sword and Lightening operations, terrorist now feel more desperate and pressured.  10. (C) Tunisia:  PolOff spoke with the Embassy's Advisor for Consular Affairs, Mr. Mohammed Kahlool, who has been living in Iraq for seven years.  He said he is accustomed to the current situation and this is "very normal" in Iraq.  He suggested that the main question terrorists are targeting only heads of missions instead of the employees is because they are pressuring Arab missions to stop supporting the Iraqi government and it fails.  Kahlool added that the Bahraini and the Egyptians were easy targets.  As for the Tunisian Embassy, he said the Ministry of Interior provides adequate security protection.  That said, diplomats have reduced their movements and staff are limited only to necessary moves.  The embassy has no plans to reduce its staff, he said.  11.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 BAGHDAD 002839  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, IZ, ECON Development, Reconstruction SUBJECT: PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT (PART 1)  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION.  1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Development of the private sector through mobilization of domestic and foreign investment is crucial to Iraq's economic recovery and reconstruction, long-term growth, and generation of sustainable jobs. Economic growth and creation of jobs is also essential for political stability. However, business in Iraq, at present, is struggling with social, institutional, and legal/regulatory constraints reminiscent of conditions existing after the fall of the Soviet Union. The USG is implementing a broad program of assistance designed to help Iraq make the transition from a statist to a market-based economy. We expect this effort to pick up momentum under the ITG, with appointment of Barham Saleh as Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC). Saleh has indicated that development of the private sector and promotion of investment are a primary mission for his Ministry. He is highlighting private sector development as an integral element of Iraq's national development strategy to be presented to the international donor community July 18-19 in Jordan, and he has requested USG assistance to spur this agenda during his tenure.  2. (U) USG policy initiatives in Iraq, bolstered by technical assistance, support fundamental economic reform that will provide the legal and institutional infrastructure needed for long term, private sector growth and job creation, as well as shorter-term efforts to spur private sector economic activity.   The overall economic development program covers three main areas:  commercial law/regulation, policy, and institutional reform; strengthening the private sector; and human capacity building. Given the broad scope of the USG's private sector development effort, this cable focuses first on microeconomic assistance programs designed to assist Iraqi businesses and individuals.  A subsequent cable will outline USG programs underway that are targeted at broader reform, at the macroeconomic level, to create the environment necessary for these firms and individuals to flourish. Baghdad 1194 provided our message to the ITG on reform and privatization of state-owned enterprises.  A strong and sustained effort to support rapid development of the private sector is key to Iraq's economic development and stability. END SUMMARY  3. (U) Microeconomic assistance programs are under the responsibility of USAID and IRMO and are coordinated through an inter-agency Private Sector Working Group in Baghdad.  These programs include: financial sector reform, business and investment facilitation, and agricultural development.  ----------------------- Financial Sector Reform -----------------------  4. (U) ACCESS TO CREDIT - Most Iraqi businesses lack access to capital.  Bank lending in Iraq consists entirely of general-purpose loans, collateralized with commercial property.  Collateralization requirements of over 150% are common thus shutting out many businesses and entrepreneurs. Although many banks have adequate liquidity to increase lending, outdated banking practices and, subsequently, high collateralization requirements are starving small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) of desperately needed capital. This contributes to poverty, low household income and social unrest. In order to address this need, financial sector reforms must aim at ensuring that investment capital is available for the smallest Iraqi entrepreneurs and businesses.  5. (U) USG efforts are providing micro-entrepreneurs, particularly women and the very poor, with greater and more reliable access to financial and non-financial services needed to improve enterprise performance and household income. To support this objective, a $36 million program has approved 12,000 micro-finance loans ranging between $500 and $25,000, with an average of $2,000 per loan. Total disbursements for these loans are over $23 million to date. The loan program aims to have 10 percent women from the total number of borrowers, and so far, women have represented 9 percent. A new $25 million micro-finance initiative seeks to expand that figure to 50 percent women borrowers while ensuring competition, wide geographic coverage, and training. Besides micro financing to the smallest Iraqi entrepreneurs, financial reforms are also underway for small size businesses, which suffer from similar capital shortages. For instance, training and installation of loan systems in Iraq's six strongest private banks are underway by USAID, which will make increased loans available in the $25,000 to $500,000 range.  6. (U) For medium-sized businesses, the USG is currently working to link private bank loan capacity with a $7 million loan program, which will make a total of $21 million available for medium-sized businesses.  USAID is also exploring the possibility of creating bank portfolio guarantees, which would ease the risk of lending to some businesses that otherwise might be excluded from the program.  In, addition, a middle-market lending and business program was established by IRMO in August 2004. The project targets medium-sized businesses based on current and future cash flows and is designed to extend business loans in the range of $500,000 to $5 million.  The program structures all loans to have a term ranging from 2 to 5 years - which is common in industrialized nations - rather one year, which is the traditional lending term in Iraq. To date, the middle-market lending & business program has created a $136 million middle-market credit facility through the establishment and funding of a private foundation.  7. (U) BANK RESTRUCTURING - Iraq's banking sector is in a shambles.  The two state-owned banks have been isolated from international markets, their policies have been centrally directed for nearly 30 years, and they have focused mostly on financing government debt.  Iraq's state- owned enterprises account for approximately 90 percent of financial lending in Iraq, but most SOE's are laden with non-performing assets. State-owned banks have very little capacity to engage in large scale lending operations to the private sector. Restructuring the banking sector would greatly improve the financial sector and overall economic efficiency.  8. (U) USG efforts have focused on bank reform by providing options and recommendations to Finance Minister al-Allawi. A Bank Restructuring Working Group, comprised of representatives of Treasury, USAID, ECON, and IRMO, has taken the lead in recommending restructuring options to the Finance Ministry. Bank restructuring and the associated costs would be assumed by the GOI with limited technical assistance from the USG. An initiative to move forward with the five approved international bank acquisitions of Iraq's private banks has been undertaken, along with direct support to expedite the acquisitions along with the six stand-alone requests that have been approved by the Iraqi Central Bank. A variety of complicated issues have stalled this much-needed injection of capital into the private banking system.  We will work to facilitate these transactions through a collaborative process with the appropriate Iraqi Ministries and Commissions. The near-term modernization of this segment of the banking industry is dependent upon these transactions being completed.  9. (U) CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT - Efficient capital markets are important for distributing investment capital to where it is needed while offering more citizens the opportunity to participate in Iraq's economic growth. Furthermore, a functioning and transparent stock market is key to reforms involving state-owned enterprises by creating a market for privatized companies.  To that end, the Iraqi Stock Exchange reopened in June 2004, and the USG is continuing to help re-tool the stock market and train Iraqis to meet the basic needs of the market.  An important part of the program being carried out by IRMO is the installation of an electronic trading, settlement, and clearing system over the next nine months, with direct information feeds to the Iraq Securities Commission (ISC) to enhance oversight.  10. (U) Another factor in developing capital markets is establishing and supporting an effective, independent ISC, which includes the development of an independent depository. Iraq's Securities Commission has been identified as the lead regulator over the stock exchange and the USG has provided initial training to the commission on the foundations of oversight, governance, and management structure.  Additional program support includes support for senior management, standardizing accounting disclosure releases, and providing computer training to stock exchange staff.  ------------------------------------ BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT FACILITATION ------------------------------------  11. (U) While Iraq has a long tradition of trade and mercantilism, many Iraqi businesses and individuals lack an understanding of modern business principals stemming from 30 years of isolation and socialist education.  The USG has established programs designed to support the development of business skills and opportunities in Iraq.  12. (U) BUSINESS SKILLS DEVELOPMENT - The Private Sector Development in Iraq (PSDI) project, under USAID's direction, is a business skills development activity intended to promote the expansion of a private, competitive, and efficient private sector in Iraq. Iraqi professionals, trained by American volunteers, are providing training and consulting services for businesses in 10-20 high-priority industry groups.  Support is provided through basic tool kits that cover such things as business planning, financial statement preparation, marketing and sales, and proposal writing.  In addition, PSDI has developed and is distributing business tool kits that can serve as self-training devices for micro- and small- entrepreneurs.  In early 2005, the program began implementing its $3 million grant component to support Iraqi enterprises.  The USG has worked closely with military units to identify and develop programs to assist private enterprises.  Other activities include training accountants in international accounting standards, assisting Iraqi universities to offerings more business classes, and retooling vocational training efforts to more closely match the needs of the Iraqi ministries.  13. (U) VOCATIONAL EDUCATION - The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is receiving USG assistance to rehabilitate and implement new curriculum in some of the Ministry's Vocational and Technical Training Centers (VTTCs). Working through USAID, this program is working with seven VTTCs in Baghdad to assist with upgrading the vocational training curricula in Iraqi ministries responsible for infrastructure and essential services.  The main purpose of this assistance is to enhance employment opportunities of Iraqis by matching skill requirements needed for the reconstruction effort with Iraq's trained through the VTTC's.  14. (U) BUSINESS CENTERS - The major goal of pilot business centers is to introduce the use of standard, international business practices, and to promote ultimate Iraqi control and management of these centers for the benefit of Iraqi businesses.  So far, pilot business centers have been established in Mosul, Kirkuk, and Baghdad, through a $4 million USG project, administered by IRMO. These centers disseminate information on employment/business opportunities and provide a wide variety of applicable services to Iraqi businesses across the country.  For instance, the centers are helping Iraqis to use the Internet to widen their accessibility to information. The centers are providing extensive hands-on training designed to improve professional and business management skills including a speakers program on relevant and timely business topics.  Other programs include creating e- commerce portals for bidding on local and government contracts, and identifying and implementing training programs tailored to specific regional and technical needs. Based on international "best practices", the business center program is encouraging business centers and other business associations across Iraq to form a National Business Alliance to voice private sector needs/concerns to government policymakers.  15. (U) INVESTMENT PROMOTION - Foreign and domestic investment is recognized as an important factor to Iraq's economic development.  Internationally, investment promotion has evolved into a highly developed business, which requires appropriate national institutions and structures, a supportive business environment and professional people, with skills and knowledge to attract investment within a highly competitive international market. In order to formalize investment promotion within the Iraqi government, USG has supported the establishment of in Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) by the Iraqi government and dedicated to the promotion and attraction of foreign and domestic investment. Some of activities which IPA's typically support include: promoting investment incentives, devising investment strategies and promoting regional investment promotion events, working with government agencies to promote investment and business approval processes, and training businessmen in successful negotiation techniques  16. (U) The USG is currently assisting the government of Iraq to establish an IPA, which will specialize in marketing Iraq to potential to foreign and domestic investors, and in providing services to new and existing businesses and industries.  Under the assistance of USAID, the IPA is designed to assist in the creation of a broader regulatory environment that will facilitate investment. USAID is also assisting in the development of an appropriate management structure, policies, and procedures for Iraq's IPA.  The IPA, under a Board of Directors, would be a public-private sector partnership designed to encourage better understand the realities of doing business in Iraq.  This activity has been identified by the GOI as a high priority item. We expect the IPA to be launched shortly, following signing of joint letter of intent by USAID and the Ministry of Planning at the July 10-11 Joint Committee on Reconstruction and Economic Development (JCRED).  17. (U) ECONOMIC TRADE ZONES - Economic zones are aimed at encouraging more investment and improving Iraq's competitive position in the global economy. Typically, businesses inside an economic zone receive many benefits including tariff and duty exemptions, land at less than market prices, reduced cost on utilities, and other benefits designed to help new businesses compete in today's market.  18. (U) The USG, through IRMO, is currently working on the establishment of an Economic Trade Zone (ETZ) in Iraq. This includes managing a pilot program to set up economic trade zones in urban hubs to ease the entry of imports and create economic stimuli in targeted areas.  This project is also designed to coordinate the construction of supporting infrastructure and security within the ETZ as well as helping determine changes to be made to existing regional and national business regulations.  The first master plan and program for an ETZ will be completed later this year in Sulayamaniyah. A private company will eventually take over management of the Sulayamaniyah Economic Trade Zone. At the national level, the ETZ project will also fund and conduct a countrywide study to identify those urban hubs most suited for establishing and developing trade or industrial development zones.  ------------------------ AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ------------------------  19. (U) Iraq's agriculture sector has great potential to create jobs and provide an alternative to oil as a source of revenue and economic growth. Reform of Iraq's public distribution and agricultural subsides will be essential to create the environment for agriculture to thrive. Through the Agriculture Reconstruction and Development Program for Iraq (ARDI) project, USAID is working with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the private sector to reinvigorate local production and markets.  Areas of emphasis include encouraging agro-enterprise development, policy and legal reform, and targeted technical and infrastructure interventions to help Iraq modernize this important economic sector.  USAID also is helping to analyze and to restore economic, social, and environmental systems in the southern Iraqi marshlands through agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and monitoring activities.  Also, cereal production improvements to wheat, barley, and maize systems from seed-to-sale are being pursued for greater food security.  Livestock improvement also is being addressed with an initial emphasis on improving animal health services especially for sheep and poultry.  Date palms, olives, horticulture, and beekeeping are receiving assistance as part of the high value agriculture component.  Capacity building though the private sector development component is strengthening trade associations, cooperatives, joint ventures, agricultural credit associations, and machinery rehabilitation.  Broader macro- level assistance to transform Iraq's agricultural industry into a market driven contributor to the economy will be addressed in a subsequent cable.  20. (SBU) COMMENT:  Rapid development of the private sector -- especially micro and small and medium businesses, which are the primary drivers of job creation -- is critical to Iraq's recovery and long-term stability.  However, the private sector faces a daunting array of challenges in the legacy left by years of state control and isolation from the international economic system.  Minister of Planning Barham Saleh recognizes this and has highlighted promotion of private sector development and investment as a primary Mission of his ministry.  He will outline this vision at the July 18-19 donors conference in Jordan.  To spur the Iraq's development as a stable, market-oriented democracy, the USG and other donors need to continue to make a strong, sustained and focused effort to help the ITG eliminate impediments and provide the incentives for rapid growth of the private sector. END COMMENT.  SATTERFIELD 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BAGHDAD 002845  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2015 TAGS: ENRG, EPET, MASS, MOPS, EFIN, EAGR, PREL, PGOV, IZ, Petrolium, Iran SUBJECT: IRAQI OIL MINISTER ON CURRENT OIL ISSUES  REF: A. BAGHDAD 2694      B. BAGHDAD 2787      C. BAGHDAD 2790 AND PREVIOUS      D. ANKARA 3842  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Iraq's Minister of Oil agreed to attend the JCRED in Amman, but formally protested the location, stating it should have been held in Iraq.  He is deeply interested in USG perspectives on how to shape the oil sector in Iraq, and looks forward to launching a continuing partnership with DOE on energy matters.  Bahr al-Ulom's primary concern is the security of the oil infrastructure, to increase exports and generate critically needed revenue for Iraq.  He strongly stated that the Ministry of Oil (MOO) can produce oil, but needs MNFI support for infrastructure security to export the crude.  He said the proposed Iran pipeline is both a support for replacing needed imports of gasoline and kerosene, and an essential alternative for possible oil export; he also underscored the fragility of the Basra port facilities and recent attacks on shipping in the vicinity of the Iraqi export terminals, and the obvious problems with the northern export route through Turkey, which is often interdicted. We emphasized again that Iraq should re-consider Saddam-era oil contracts.  END SUMMARY.  2. (SBU) Iraqi Minister of Oil, Bahr al-Ulom, met the Charge', EMINCOUNS, IRMO Director and emboffs in the Republican Palace on July 1.  We extended a formal invitation to the JCRED and the DOE Bilateral Meeting in Amman, Jordan.  ----- JCRED -----  3.  (SBU) Bahr al-Ulom stated his strong preference for hosting bilateral meetings in Iraq rather than in another country.  Bahr al-Ulom initially stated he would need to get permission from the PM to attend, but later said he would come with the other ministers to Amman.  He said he was looking forward to launching the DOE relationship and engaging with DAS Brodman.  He desires to form a focused MOO-DOE team to assess the oil sector in Iraq and obtain USG perspectives on Iraq's ideas on how to develop it. He said he would encourage focused meetings on specific issues with the DOE ./. He said he would like to initiate and expand the training opportunities for the development of MOO personnel with the DOE.  Specifically, Bahr al-Ulom said he would like in the future to have a workshop, and have a product to give the government for review on how the oil sector of Iraq should be developed.  --------------------------------------------- - IRAQI OIL EXPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION --------------------------------------------- -  3.  (C) Bahr al-Ulom said his primary concern is the security of the northern oil infrastructure.  He said MOO could export 250-300,000 barrels of oil per day from the north if the pipelines were secured.  He said he had been very disappointed with the security forces thus far. The Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIBS) "were ineffective and not qualified" to protect the infrastructure.  He said he had worked with the Minister of Defense (MOD) on the forces, and had discussed many issues related to the oil infrastructure security.  He stated, "I did not like the response of the MOD to oil security."  4.  (C) Bahr al-Ulom said his primary concern was the lack of security of the pipeline from Kirkuk to Bayji, including the Al Fathah crossing over the Tigris. He strongly emphasized, "I need the Iraqi Army units with support from MNFI to secure this pipeline."   He said we need a strategy to deal with the tribes for the protection of the oil pipelines.  He then continued, "We need to protect against the attacks in Baghdad, and the basic infrastructure services which support the capital." He stated, "I see no support from the coalition forces for infrastructure security. I see hesitancy from MNFI."  (COMMENT: According to MNSTC-I: MNF-I continues efforts to encourage ITG leadership in development of the strategic infrastructure protection force, MNF-I support has already been significant.  This support includes repositioning of some Iraqi forces under coalition tactical control, preparations to train Iraqi trainers beginning in mid-July and assisting the JHQ in developing a plan to train and professionalize the Strategic Infrastructure Battalions. Additionally, other funds have been provided for infrastructure hardening).   With the current proposal to develop four strategic infrastructure battalions, MNSTC-I has offered up to $35M in matching funds.  MNSTC-I recently provided $5M to buttress 42ID efforts in infrastructure protection.  END COMMENT.) (NOTE:   Septel on Iraq NEC Meeting of July 4 will report the decision at the July 4 meeting on a  a new plan involving MNFI and Iraqi Army support for oil pipeline infrastructure protection in the north of Iraq as briefed to the NEC by the Deputy Commander of the Iraqi Armed Forces.  END NOTE)  5.  (C). Bahr al-Ulom maintained that many of the attacks were local insider attacks against the infrastructure.  He said he thought continuous security along the entire pipeline was required.  This was related to his opinion that, "The SIBS are useless and we cannot depend on them."  He continued, "We can produce oil and transport it out of the country for export.  We can fix our pipelines, and when we do that, they kill our repair crews.  We need security!"  6.  (SBU) Bahr al-Ulom said the tender offer for the Kirkuk oil sold on June 30 was West Texas minus $4.69, or about $52 per barrel.  He said the Persian Gulf oil price had been about $38 in April, and now was over $45 per barrel.  -------------------- OIL PIPELINE TO IRAN --------------------  7. (SBU) Bahr al-Ulom said Iraq presently does not have any significant trade with Iran.  The ITG is considering a deal to send crude oil to Iran over a pipeline with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day (bpd); however, he expected this pipeline to be utilized at about 30-50,000 bpd of shipped crude oil, and as a return pipeline for products. He said, "We want to minimize imports of products by trucks and barges and ships, and would rather have pipelines into our national product distribution networks as we can move it throughout the country more efficiently and in a less complicated manner, as well as reducing the criminal hijacking of fuel trucks in that area." He explained the proposed Iran pipeline is a good option for more efficient import of gasoil, fuel oil and kerosene.  8.  (SBU) Iraq is also interested in gasoline imports, but this commodity is short in Iran and is not included in this proposal. He said this is a small project, only 40 kilometers of pipeline and a cost of about $50 million.  Technically and economically it is a good idea for Iraq. He said the ITG had done a study of the Iran project, and it is economically beneficial, even at the maximum throughput of 150,000 bpd. Bahr al-Ulom stated the primary driver of this deal is to add crude oil export capacity and an essential alternative to the Al Faw pipeline in the south for oil export; citing the fragility of the Basra port facilities and recent attacks on shipping in the vicinity of the Iraqi export terminals, and the obvious problems with the northern export route through Turkey, which remains interdicted. This also meets the Iraqi principal political goal of strengthening relationships with its neighbors.  He closed this topic with the comment, "It is good to have another outlet as an alternative to Basra--we  need another outlet!"  Charge outlined and emphasized USG concerns with this project.  ----------------- PAYMENT TO TURKEY -----------------  9.  (SBU) Bahr al-Ulom said thanks for the US help and support on the payments to Turkey.  There are now 25 kilometers of trucks lined up to enter Iraq from Turkey bringing needed fuel and other commodities.  He said he had talked to SOMO and told them that more stocks were needed in Baghdad, as the supply of diesel had dropped from 100 million liters to 65 million liters, and that 255 trucks had delivered diesel to Baghdad on June 30.  He said Turkey was now happy with the payments and they had signed contracts for six more months of fuel supplies from Turkish suppliers. ( REF: D)  ----------------------- SUBSIDIES AND SMUGGLING -----------------------  10.  (SBU)  Bahr al-Ulom said they were making progress against smugglers, and had recently arrested 240 people involved with smuggling gasoline at Bayji.  The smugglers were both the truck contractors and the drivers associated with stealing gasoline and reselling it. He had talked to the PM and had authorized the selling of high quality gasoline in Baghdad from 20 roving trucks, selling the gasoline at 100 ID per liter, or ten times the original price.  He said this was a start, and that gasoline in neighboring countries was still much higher, for example Kuwait at $.20, Jordan at $.42 per liter.  He did say that the prices on the Syrian and Jordanian borders were far too low, so he had authorized those gasoline stations to raise the price to 250 ID per liter to reduce the influx of foreigners from crossing the border to fill up on cheap gasoline.  He said this price was in effect for areas up to 60 kilometers inside Iraq.  --------------------------------------------- ------------ PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTS IN THE OIL SECTOR --------------------------------------------- ------------  11.  (SBU)  Bahr al-Ulom said the ITG is very positive on private sector investment in oil, especially in the downstream sector, like refineries and distribution networks.  He said, "We cannot support the investment internally, so we need outside help" and there was a continuing dialogue among the ministers on this topic.  He said he had personally discussed these investment strategies with the Prime Minister.  He went on to say that there is no support in the populace for upstream private sector investment in the oil fields.  He said, "I know we need to expand production and I need foreign investment to do this, but there is resistance in the populace."  12.  (SBU) We reviewed again the USG position with respect to Saddam era contracts.  Bahr al-Ulom replied that they were not fair to Iraq, they would not be accepted as legal contracts in Iraq, and "clearly we have no commitments on Saddam-era contracts."  He did state that the Ministry of Oil was talking with and meeting representatives from many different companies and laying the groundwork for future private sector investment in the downstream oil sector in Iraq.    11.  (SBU)  On the walk out of the embassy after the meeting with the Charge, Bahr al-Ulom strongly stated to emboff that, "I will not attend another meeting outside of Iraq.  We should have held it in the North!"  He then told emboff he would come to Amman and will bring 2-3 members of MOO as staff support and advisors for the meetings with DOE and for the JCRED.  ------- COMMENT -------  12.  (C) COMMENT: The minister is deeply interested in launching a continuing substantive dialogue with DOE and we expect him to be actively involved in both the DOE bilateral and the JCRED in Amman.  He wants USG assistance with developing the oil sector strategy for Iraq, and would prefer to deal with the USG, as an honest broker, as he deals with the multitude of international oil companies actively pursuing investments in Iraq and seeks their perspectives as well.  He is very dissatisfied, as are the rest of the NEC members, with the security situation for infrastructure across Iraq.  In the view of the MOO, the northern pipeline interdictions are costing Iraq huge sums of money each month, which could be used to support economic development and job creation.   He, as his predecessor had, requested MNFI support for the protection of the pipelines in combination with the Iraqi Army units. Finally, his strong support for opening an alternative export pipeline through Iran showed both his concern for the fragility of the two current export options of Basra and Turkey, and his political reality that Iraq needs to have good relations with all of its neighbors.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July. 7 were Talabani's and Al-Jafari's meeting with a U.S. congressional delegation, the Minister of Defense's visit to Tehran, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Dialogue with armed groups" (As-Sabah, 7/7) B. "Will Article 9 of the TAL be ignored?" (Al-Ittihad, 7/7)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Dialogue with armed groups" (As-Sabah, 7/7)  As-Sabah (independent) published a third-page editorial about the recent reports on dialogue with Iraqi gunmen:  "The recent reports of a dialogue with gunmen, or those who refer to themselves as the 'resistance,' represents a worrisome obsession. Some observers believe that the importance of a dialogue lies in defeating terrorism and ending the insurgency in Iraq. Others argue that such a dialogue merely represents tactical measures by the parties involved. They also point out that this dialogue is not a new development because the British Times reported last February that secret negotiations were being conducted between the U.S. and armed groups in Iraq.  Last week, President Talabani declared that the negotiations with armed groups is an American affair and the Iraqi government has no involvement in this matter. On the other hand, the National Assembly has begun discussing the latest demands that call for negotiations with armed Iraqi groups. However, the National Assembly insists that it is necessary to first identify these groups and their objectives.  It is important to note that the vast majority of Iraqi society opposes dialogue with the terrorists. The Iraqi street realizes that these groups seek to hinder the new Iraqi political project, which is established according to peaceful dialogues that will strengthen our democratic state. It is impossible to distinguish between resisting the multi-national forces and killing Iraqi policemen and government employees. The increased number of terrorist operations that randomly target innocent civilians has led Iraqis to realize that these groups have only one goal. They want to retaliate against those individuals who stepped on the dictator's statues, buried the dictatorship, and chose the experiment of democracy and freedom. Therefore, whoever wants to begin a dialogue with these groups must first take into account the bloodshed of innocent Iraqis and think twice about the real objectives of such dialogues."  B. "Will Article 9 of the TAL be ignored?" (Al-Ittihad, 7/7)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with PUK led by Jalal Talabani) published a third-page column by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about the constitution:  "Without a doubt, the constitutional stage represents an extremely important period in the history of the new Iraq. If the Iraqi people choose to ratify the new constitution, it will become the document that represents all sects and guides the country's future. All Iraqi political groups agreed previously that the TAL would provide the foundation for the new constitution. However, there are still articles of the TAL that have yet to be implemented. The stated purpose of the TAL was to administer the transitional period until an elected government would be established that would draft a permanent constitution. Therefore, the former interim and current governments hold responsibility for applying these articles of the TAL. Unfortunately, this has not happened.  Article 58 has not yet been implemented and was postponed without any justifiable reason. Additionally, Article 9 of the TAL has been ignored. This article states that Arabic and Kurdish are the two official languages of Iraq and that all Iraqi citizens have the right to teach their children their mother language, including Turkmen and Armenian. Article 9 also requires that the official Iraqi newspaper be published in both Arabic and Kurdish. Speeches and addresses during official meetings of the National Assembly, the cabinet, and the courts must be presented in Arabic and Kurdish. Other official business, such as currency, passports, and stamps, must be printed in both languages. The federal institutions in Kurdistan must also use Arabic and Kurdish. These are the requirements as specified by Article 9.  Have these above-mentioned paragraphs been implemented? The article calls for a law to be issued that would require the implementation of these paragraphs, but no such law has been issued thus far. As a result, Article 9 is inapplicable because there is no enforcement mechanism. In addition, many government offices do not accept Kurdish- written statements. These offices return such statements to their place of origin in order to be translated. Passports and currencies are also being issued only in Arabic. We believe that it is the National Assembly's duty to raise this issue for inclusive discussion. The Assembly must specify why Article 9 has not been implemented. We hope that the constitutional committee members will not disregard this article because it is necessary for the future of Iraq."  SATTERFIELD

Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY: Deputy Prime Minister Abid Mutlak al- Jaburi and Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Adnan al-Janabi, both Sunni Arabs, offered Senator Carl Levin a wide range of initiatives to reach out to their community in a July 5 dinner meeting.  Both Jaburi and Janabi supported holding to the TAL timeline for constitution drafting and elections. They called for a halt to what they called indiscriminate and aggressive military operations targeting Sunni areas, and they complained that the Iraqi security services were poorly led and inadequately trained.  They also sought the release of high-profile detainees and an improved process to disseminate information about detainees.  Jaburi warned that the Jafari government risks further alienating the Sunni population with a plan to confiscate the assets of former Ba'athists and regime officials.  (However, one leading Iraqi government official has since told us there is no such plan under consideration.)  Both Jaburi and Janabi expected strong Sunni Arab participation in the next elections but said the IECI needs to be replaced because it is politicized. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) Codel Levin explored possibilities for improved Sunni Arab outreach in a dinner July 5 with Deputy Prime Minister Abid Mutlak al-Jaburi and Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Adnan al-Janabi.  Both Jaburi and Janabi supported sticking with the TAL deadlines on constitution drafting, the referendum, and the next elections.  Janabi said that following the induction of Sunni Arabs into the constitution drafting committee, he was optimistic that the document could be completed on time.  But Jaburi lamented that Sunni extremists, Shia extremists, and leaders in "neighboring states" were all working to keeping the Sunni Arab population marginalized from the political process.  He warned, "Our non- participation will halt the whole American plan here - - our children and the Americans will still be fighting instead of living in freedom and democracy."  ----------------------- LISTING THE INITIATIVES -----------------------  3.  (C) The following set of initiatives was proposed over dinner with the Charge and the Iraqi leaders. Jaburi elaborated on some of them in a letter he wrote to Senator Levin and the Charge, excerpts of which have been translated below.  The central goal of all of these plans, both men said repeatedly, was to end the "humiliation" of the Sunni community so it can reclaim a place of honor in the political process.  -- HALT AGGRESSIVE "ANTI-SUNNI" OPERATIONS: Both Jaburi and Janabi were convinced that arrest campaigns and military operations were being deliberately targeted at the Sunni community.   When Senator Levin pointed out that this was natural since the Sunni community was the center of the insurgency, neither man was assuaged.  The names of the operations are themselves provocative, Jaburi said, referring to Operations "Lightning" and "Spear."  Jaburi said, "Every day hundreds are killed or hurt in these attacks."  Particularly offensive are raids on mosques and the detention of women, he said.  In sum, he said, he was asking for "more mercy" and more thought about excessive use of force.  Janabi said that he successfully coordinated North Babil operations while serving as Minister of State in the Allawi government. The lesson of the experience was that random military searches only provoked the population while targeted operations was much more effective at winning local trust.  -- RELEASE PROMINENT DETAINEES, IMPROVE INFORMATION FLOW: Jaburi said that the Iraqi government and MNF-I should build confidence with the Sunni Arab community by releasing detained clerics, former senior officers, and local notables. "Even if they've made small mistakes, close your eyes a little bit," Jaburi said. Jaburi's letter calls for the release of those who did not committee a "witnessed crime."  Janabi said the process of informing Iraqis about detained relatives was improved, but he complained that Iraqis still have too much trouble finding out the nature of the charges against them.  (NOTE: MNF-I currently has under detention thirty-eight Sunni clerics, nineteen rated high or extreme threat, ten as medium threat, and nine still in initial interview.  A number of former senior Ba'ath officials categorized as "High-Value Detainees" have been approved by MNF-I for release, but these releases have been awaiting ITG approval for months, and several of these HVDs are now under consideration for trial by the Iraqi Special Tribunal.  END NOTE)  -- IMPROVE PROFESSIONALISM IN THE IRAQI FORCES: Jaburi said that politicized and under-qualified personnel plague the Iraqi security services.  Too many former criminals and low-ranking officers have been unduly promoted to senior rank.  "Some men who never attended a military academy are colonels," he said. "There are thieves who are captains."  Jaburi alleged in his letter that many soldiers are stealing property during raids and demanding ransom in exchange for the release of detainees.  Militias, he argued, must be dissolved and assurances must be made that soldiers are serving the nation, not their sect.  -- BE MORE REALISTIC ON IRAQI MILITARY TRAINING: Jaburi, a former Iraqi army officer himself, called for more intensive and realistic approach to the training of the Iraqi military.  Figures on Iraqi force strength are exaggerated because large numbers of soldiers are absentees, he claimed.  Speaking as a former division commander, Jaburi said that Iraq does not really have 10 divisions despite announcements to that effect.  Each group falls short of 1,000 soldiers even though the government is allocating funding for that amount and seeing it disappear.  Jaburi pointed out that Iraq's monarchy held the country under its control with a force of only 15,000 soldiers.  The 1958 coup was carried out with only one division, and the Ba'athist coup in 1968 was pulled off with less than a hundred leading Ba'athists in charge and an extremely small number of troops.  If the government really controlled some 170,000 soldiers -- the current statistic -- then all would be well, he said. -- FIND MORE OBJECTIVE ELECTION OVERSIGHT: Both Jaburi and Janabi were convinced that the IECI was a partisan body in the service of Kurdish and Shia interests. They want it replaced altogether in time for the next elections.  Jaburi's letter recommends having the "Iraqi judiciary" oversee the elections rather than the IECI.  The letter also suggests having an "international neutral party provide oversight in the presence of an American official," mentioning as examples the UN and the Arab League.  (Note: The TAL states that IECI has sole authority for elections throughout Iraq during the transitional period.  Also, there already exists a non-voting UN Commissioner seat in the IECI Board of Commissioners.  End Note.)  -- ELECTIONS BY DISTRICTS:  Both men supported holding future elections with slots allotted to each district. This step would ensure representation for each province, unlike the previous system, they said. (Comment: We understand most members of the constitution drafting committee are leaning in this direction.  End Comment)  -- INITIATE MORE MEETINGS: Jaburi's letter calls for Iraqi and U.S. officials to increase the tempo and scope of their outreach meetings with notables and shaykhs and former officers to encourage participation in the political process and hear complaints.  -- HALT THE "NEW GOVERNMENT CONFISCATION CAMPAIGN": Jaburi claimed that the Iraqi Council of Ministers had passed or would soon pass a policy to confiscate the assets of all Ba'ath Party "Division Members" and all former regime officials who held the rank of Director General or higher.  Jaburi claimed that the policy would stretch back to assets acquired since 1979 and would bankrupt a wide swath of Sunni Arabs.  The government planned to carry out the policy through the creation of a special court, he said.  Jaburi said only he and Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Chalabi had opposed the plan.  In his letter, Jaburi warned, "This decision will be more disastrous and dangerous than the dissolution of the army and the de-Ba'athification campaign." (Comment: Jaburi appears to be entirely mistaken here, but his fears reflect the widespread sense of persecution that De-Ba'athification policies have created, even amongst those who have nothing to fear from the process.  Da'wa Party leader and Jafari colleague Nuri Kamil told Poloff on July 6 that no such confiscation policy has been presented or contemplated.  Kamil said the only possible grain of truth in this allegation was that Ba'athists had stolen Iraqi assets and the Iraqi government, by law, has always reserved the right to reclaim assets stolen from the Iraqi people.  And, of course, De- Ba'athification law does single out Division Level Ba'athists and Directors General as the lowest rung of "senior" members of the former regime.  Kamil emphasized that in practice the government has never made a single confiscation.  "It is just ink on paper," he said.  End Comment)  ----------------------------- COMMENT: Buttressing the IECI For the Battle Ahead -----------------------------  4.  (C) The doubts both men expressed over the IECI are real cause for concern.  While we will work diligently to keep them on board, there is a real danger that some Sunni Arab leaders -- perhaps even members of the committee -- could campaign to vote down the constitution in the referendum.  The Sunni Arabs likely to lead such an effort will undoubtedly be among those who are convinced that the Sunni Arabs hold a majority in this country and an overwhelming majority in several provinces.  They are likely to fail in the referendum because, despite these dreams, Sunni Arabs lack two-thirds of the votes in three provinces.  When they do fail, these Sunni Arab leaders will face a choice: accept the legitimacy of the referendum and the concurrent fact that Sunnis are not even close to a majority in Iraq, or reject the legitimacy of the IECI and cling to the illusion that they are Iraq's majority.  They are depressingly likely to make the latter choice, which means the IECI will already be under fire from some leaders in the Sunni Arab community at precisely the moment when we are gearing up to encourage wide Sunni Arab participation in the next elections.  5.  (C) It will, therefore, be important to boost the credibility of the IECI among the Sunni community. Doing that will require more contact between the IECI and Sunni Arab organizations, political and non- political, and a solid demonstration by the IECI that it is sensitive to the election-related needs of the Sunni Arab community.  In contrast to other parts of Iraq, a higher-profile role by the UN and other international observers would be helpful in Iraqi Sunni Arab areas.  If some of those observers are credible representatives from other Sunni Arab states, this would further ease Iraqi Sunni Arab suspicions.  6.

Ford. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)  1.  (C) Summary.  In a July 6 meeting with Codel Levin, PM Jafari opined that a constitution is achievable by August 15.  Despite repeated attempts, CODEL Levin did not obtain Jafari's acknowledgement that a resolution by the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) welcoming the presence of Coalition Forces or an ITG announcement of a "plan" of security transfer would be useful.  Regarding Sunni concerns about a new legal initiative on confiscation of property, Jafari explained that the law would not confiscate Sunni money.  Instead, the law will allow seizure of stolen money from criminal elements that are using these funds to finance terrorism.  Finally, Jafari acknowledged that the Jordanian King's recent speech condemning terrorism and sympathizers was a positive gesture.  End Summary.  AUG 15 DRAFT ACHIEVABLE -----------------------  2.  (C) In a July 6 meeting CODEL Levin asked Prime Minster Jafari if a full constitution could be produced by August 15.  Citing Iraq's determination to successfully hold elections and form a government, Jafari replied in the affirmative.  He said, "I do not exaggerate when I say 80 to 90 percent of the constitution has already been agreed on."  Without going into details, Jafari listed the following outstanding issues hanging over the constitution: Kirkuk; federalism; articles on Islam; protection of minorities, human/women's rights; the risk that the draft constitution might be rejected by 2/3 of the voters in three or more provinces, thus sinking the draft; and the transfer of power if the draft constitution passes.  WELCOME BY TNA DESIRABLE ------------------------  3.  (C) Senator Levin repeatedly asked Jafari if he thought that a TNA resolution -- stating that the Coalition Forces were not "occupiers" and Iraqis want them to be here -- could be "useful".  Levin explained that such a resolution would help counter the insurgency's propaganda.  Jafari merely replied that the TNA understands that the CF needs to be in Iraq.  4.  (C) Similarly, Levin inquired if it would be useful to announce a "plan" of military cooperation between the Iraqi forces and the CF that -- without setting a timeline for departure -- that outlines the transfer of security responsibility as the Iraqi forces grow stronger.  Jafari replied that as Iraqi forces increase their capacity, they would take more responsibility and leadership in the provinces. However, to give Iraqi forces total control, Jafari noted that both tactical and strategic capabilities have to be developed further.  Jafari added that he would continue to meet with military leaders on the ground, including General Casey, to discuss Iraqi forces taking more leading roles.  SUNNIS THREATENED BY NEW LAW? -----------------------------  5.  (C) Senator Levin shared Sunni leaders' concern regarding a new law initiative on confiscation of property under review by the Council of Ministers. The law has not come before the TNA yet.  Jafari explained that the Sunni leaders do not have a clear idea about the law; it does not confiscate Sunni money or even ex-Baathist money -- only stolen money.  He added that there is no intent in the law to target the old regime.  Jafari explained that the law would allow seizure of stolen money from criminal elements that are using the funds to finance terrorism.  6.  (C) Finally, Levin asked if Jordan is playing a constructive role.  Jafari mentioned that the terrorist Zarqawi is Jordanian and Iraqi money in Jordan is being used against Iraq.  However, he conceded that on July 5 the Jordanian King gave a positive speech condemning terrorism and sympathizers. If Jordanian policy follows the lines of the speech, Jafari concluded, it would be positive.  7.  (C) Comment.  Jafari's list of outstanding constitutional issues is far more important and sensitive than the 10 - 20 percent weighting Jafari provided.  Disagreements on Kirkuk alone have the potential to seriously delay the process, as when the Kurds threatened to boycott the Provincial Council election in January.  Jafari declined repeatedly to encourage either the idea of a TNA resolution welcoming the presence of Coalition Forces or an announcement by his government of a "plan" for eventual security transfer.  Jafari appears to be wary of raising the issue of the Coalition Forces directly with the Assembly -- an attitude that is aggravating the hard-line stance adopted by a minority of the Assembly members.

Embassy Baghdad believes they will be useful to posts as they approach host governments on the July 18-19 IRRFI Conference.  END SUMMARY  2. Vision Statement:  BEGIN TEXT  Iraq's Strategic Vision For National Development  Presented to the International Conference on Iraq Brussels, Belgium 21-22 June 2005  Republic of Iraq [flag of Iraq] Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation  Vision Statement "Accelerating the Pace and Reconstruction and Development"  The Government of Iraq has a clear vision for the country based on its National Development Strategy.  The Vision is:  "Transform Iraq into a peaceful, unified federal democracy and a prosperous, market-oriented regional economic powerhouse that is fully integrated into the global economy."  This ambitious Vision can only be achieved by a market- oriented economy.  One that is open to the world, driven by the ingenuity and creativity of private enterprise, founded on the rule of law, and led by a democratic, transparent and accountable government.  The reforms required to achieve this Vision are complex and challenging but need to be carefully paced and sequenced, accompanied by social safety net measures to protect the poor and most vulnerable in society.  The recently published Iraqi Living Conditions Survey documents the severe deterioration in the quality of life of the Iraqi family relative to a baseline of 1980, when the previous regime began its tragic effort to gain regional hegemony.  This is reflected in the unstable and unreliable supply of electricity with more than 3.2 million households experiencing interruptions.  The high cost and low quality of water with more than 76 percent of all rural households having problems accessing drinking water.  The alarming reduction in urban access to safe drinking water from 90% to 60% of the population.  The decline in the quality of sanitation with more than 1.5 million people suffering from unimproved sewer systems and the high cost and low quality of housing with more than 45% of all households reporting dissatisfaction.  The Survey also documents the precipitous collapse of the health system.  This is reflected in the decline in primary health care centers from 1,800 in 1991 to 929 in 2001 of which more than 30 percent need rehabilitation.  Maternal mortality remains above regional averages with more than half of deliveries taking place at home in rural areas. The high incidence of respiratory infections in urban areas and the fact that over 200,000 Iraqis have chronic illness due to the war serves to underscore the poor overall conditions of the population.  The Survey shows there is widespread unemployment in Iraq, in particular among young men whose unemployment rate reaches an astonishing 37 percent.  The employment situation is complicated by the fact that Iraq has an estimated 192 state-owned enterprises that together employ 500,000 people.  Yet many of these state-owned enterprises are not commercially viable, many having been looted and destroyed during the war.  Indeed, most of these enterprises are idle and will not be able to create jobs in the foreseeable future.  Supporting these loss-making state-owned enterprises imposes a huge burden on the economy and crowd out opportunities for new private-sector initiatives.  It is evident from the above grim statistics that the legacy of the previous regime, and regrettably the failure of the international community to ensure that the Oil-for- Food program was immune from manipulation by the previous regime, has caused immense damage to Iraq.  Given these serious challenges, Iraq is determined to its unequivocal and enduring commitment to the path of reform and to deliver effective results-driven leadership.  This will require the transparent and efficient use of public expenditures, from both domestic and foreign sources, and the eradication of corruption.  A reflection of this commitment is the fact that the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Iraq and the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC) have jointly resolved to create synergies by working together more effectively to implement the needed reforms.  The Ministry of Finance will continue to play a leading role in economic policy making with a particular emphasis on maintaining budget discipline and implementing sound fiscal policy.  The Central Bank of Iraq will continue to lead in implementing a sound monetary policy and prudent regulation of the financial and banking systems.  MOPDC is the lead Government agency for private sector development and investment planning and investment promotion.  It will continue as the officially designated focal point for the international donor community, and is charged with the overall supervision of the preparation, negotiation, implementation, and evaluation of all donor- funded projects in Iraq.  However, it is clear that Iraq cannot achieve this ambitious Vision in isolation.  Iraq will require enhanced partnerships with the international community.  Enhanced partnerships, based on mutual accountability, will accelerate the pace of reconstruction and development and improve the quality of life of the ordinary Iraqis.  The partnership between Iraq and the international community has realized remarkable achievements since the dawn of the new Iraq.  In the area of infrastructure rehabilitation, telecommunication networks have been expanded, electricity and water networks improved, over 1,000 schools have been rehabilitated and numerous roads, bridges and ports are under construction.  In the area of fiscal and monetary policy much has been done to restore the capacity and credibility of Iraq's financial institutions.  Our efforts in monetary reform have stabilized the new Iraqi Dinar and restrained hyperinflation.  This includes providing Central Bank independence and strengthening the tools of monetary policy.  Achieving the Paris Club debt forgiveness agreement has dramatically improved Iraq's fiscal stance as has introducing fiscal prudence into budgetary processes with a view towards equity and accountability.  Steps towards accountability include improving the fiscal oversight powers and auditing capacity of the Board of Supreme Audit and ministerial inspector general offices, as well as establishing precedents for use of independent external auditors on government accounts.  In the area of market-oriented reforms, Iraq has revised several of its key commercial laws, maintained low custom fees to encourage imports and exports, developed strategies for reducing government price controls and laid the groundwork for privatization.  Iraq has also established a major agricultural revitalization campaign and passed an internationally compliant insurance law in March 2005 that became effective in June, 2005.  To deepen integration with the world economy Iraq signed an Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) agreement with the IMF, initiated WTO accession talks, and concluded the United Nations Oil-for-Food program.  However, despite the tremendous progress to date, much remains to be done to overcome formidable challenges facing Iraq.  Iraq has demonstrated its commitment to transparent, accountable and efficient use of public resources.  If, together, we are to meet the pace we need to achieve our goals, we will need international donors to sharply scale- up resource transfers, including direct budget support, and ensure that pledges are disbursed in a predictable manner. It will also be necessary to streamline and simplify the procedures for disbursing donor assistance, and ensure that nation-wide projects are executed nationally and are fully aligned with the priorities established in Iraq's National Development Strategy (NDS).  Priorities Our Strategic Vision rests on the following key drivers of economic performance: - Removing constraints to private sector development, which is the future engine of job creation and economic diversification, within a strong legal and regulatory framework supported by accountable government institutions. - Improving the quality of life and ensuring gender equality and human resource development. - Strengthening good governance, democratization and human rights.  Transparency and accountability are an integral part of successful government operations in a democratic country governed by the rule of law. - Enhancing donor coordination for development effectiveness.  Objectives  Within each priority we have identified the following key objectives:  Creating an Enabling Environment for Sustainable Economic Growth  1.  Maintain low inflation within the context of sound monetary policy, and expanded monetary policy tools. 2.  Maintain fiscally sound budgets and transparent controls for budget formulation.  Meeting fiscal targets will be assisted by subsidy reforms.  The Government is about to announce the first phase of a two-pronged plan to increase the official price of fuel and create a private sector role to import refined petroleum products for retail sale.  The Government also expects to remove ancillary products included in the Public Distribution System (PDS) basket, as well as implement pilot projects for monetization of the PDS' benefits. 3.  Develop and implement mechanisms to ensure transparent and full accountability of oil revenues within the budget process, including recommendations from the IAMB and their auditor KPMG. 4.  Conclude debt relief agreements with both Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors. 5.  Implement all macroeconomic and structural reforms under the IMF's Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) agreement, including implementing a timely and accurate monetary survey and establishing a single treasury account. 6.  Improve the quality, timeliness, and range of financial and economic data produced by government offices for economic planning. 7.  Secure the return of frozen assets from a number of countries, including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Switzerland and Thailand. 8.  Establish independent national oil and gas companies (both upstream and downstream), and promote sector partnerships between Iraqi and foreign oil and gas companies. 9.  Implement fiscal decentralization and devolution of planning responsibility to local and regional governments. 10.  Diversify sources of growth towards agriculture and services. 11.  Increase domestic resource mobilization by creating conditions conducive to private savings by strengthening the deposit-taking commercial banking sector with a national payments system.  Removing Constraints to Private Sector Development 1.  Streamline and simplify the procedures for doing business in Iraq.  In that context a new Foreign Investment Law is under consideration, including the establishment of an Investment Promotion Agency. 2.  Implement commercial and regulatory reform to develop a transparent legal and institutional framework to encourage entrepreneurship. 3.  Lay the groundwork for eventual privatization of state- owned-enterprises, according to orderly, fair, consistent and transparent procedures. 4.  Promote private sector-led implementation of local community projects that are executed nationally. 5.  Restructure State-owned banks to encourage consolidation and privatization. 6.  Expand the availability of commercial capital through concessional financing for micro-finance and small and medium enterprises. 7.  Complete accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and revitalize regional trading links. 8.  Close the digital divide by increasing access to telecommunications. 9.  Rehabilitate and expand regional airports. 10.  Rehabilitate and expand the national railway network.  Improving The Qualify of Life 1.  Increase electricity generation and distribution to meet current and projected needs. 2.  Provide clean accessible water to all Iraqis. 3.  Equip and expand hospitals and primary health care centers. 4.  Increase affordable housing units through housing finance facilities and a securities-based mortgage system that allows lenders to pool their risks. 5.  Explore the possibility of providing an oil-dividend to all Iraqis to enable them to share in the rich natural wealth of the country.  This is consistent with the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) that calls for distributing oil revenues in an equitable manner.  An Iraqi National Identity Card System will be instrumental in ensuring the success of this program.  But more importantly will be a consolidated governmental effort to continue improving the formulation, execution, and oversight of fiscal policy and oil revenues in Iraq with added transparency, public participation, and stronger institutional checks and balances. 6.  Increase adult literacy and vocational training. 7.  Reduce school dropout rates. 8.  Reduce maternal and infant mortality. 9.  Enact a social safety net program for the poor and vulnerable, which may extend from reform and monetization of the PDS basket. 10.  Restructure and accelerate demining activities, with MOPDC responsible for budgeting and the Civil Defense Corp and/or Ministry of Defense responsible for demining operations.  Strengthening Good Governance, Democratization and Human Rights 1.  Accelerate judicial reform to ensure an impendent and effective Judiciary. 2.  Implement the new public procurement regulations for Ministries and public agencies for proper and effective use of State funds. 3.  Establish a Leadership Code of Conduct and Ethics requiring inter alia declaration of wealth by public officials to ensure good governance. 4.  Strengthen the Public Integrity Commission and decentralize its activities to the regions to eradicate corruption. 5.  Continue strengthening the Board of Supreme Audit and decentralize its activities to the regions to ensure transparency in public financial management. 6.  Train the police and prisons force in human rights. 7.  Empower civil society, including support for a free press. 8.  Establish e-government to modernize governmental business processes. 9.  Promote gender equality as a general public policy.  Enhancing Donor Coordination for Development Effectiveness 1.  MOPDC will strengthen its capacity as the Government's lead agency for private sector development and investment planning and investment promotion. 2.  Through its Grant Aid Coordination Unit, MOPDC will strengthen its role as the point of contact for all donor coordination, to ensure the proper and effective allocation of all donor resources to the areas of highest priority, under the overall policy guidance of the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB). 3.  MOPDC will strengthen its capacity to coordinate directly with the Ministry of Finance to integrate donor funding into the national budget, to ensure conformity with the overall budgetary framework. 4.  MOPDC will strengthen its capacity to guide, assist and supervise sector Ministries in their national execution of donor-funded projects within their respective sectors, and coordinate between these Ministries and multilateral and bilateral financial and developmental organizations. 5.  As Chair of the Council for International Coordination (CIC), the Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation will recommend a new donor coordination mechanism that will be more inclusive, Iraqi-led, based in Baghdad, linked to donors in Amman, Jordan via video-conference, and supported by the United Nations and other donors and institutions. 6.  Donors will be urged to simplify and harmonize their policies, procedures and practices to minimize bureaucracy and delays in project implementation. 7.  Operationalize a comprehensive Donor Assistance Database.  Conclusion Iraq's Vision is about achieving demonstrable socioeconomic development results for all Iraqi people that are sustainable over the long-term and touch the lives of every single Iraqi.  This is an integrated Vision with clear inter-relationships between many aspects.  Often key activities under one objective will also contribute to delivering others.  Anchoring our Vision for the future is the realization that improving the quality of democratic institutions and processes, managing the changing role of the State and promoting a vibrant civil society must underpin our overarching goal to rebuild Iraq and improve the quality of life of all Iraqis.  The forthcoming National Development Strategy (NDS), to be presented at the IRFFI Donor's Committee Meeting in Amman, Jordan on July 18-19 2005, will provide additional details of Iraq's Strategic Vision and specific objectives for economic reconstruction and development.  It will link priorities for reconstruction with broad reform initiatives in order to articulate national economic goals for the benefit of the Iraqi people and assist the international community in delivering support.  The NDS will encompass the established economic policies of the Iraqi government as reflected in the TAL, the EPCA agreement signed with the IMF, and the Financial Management Law.  The NDS will be endorsed by the National Assembly, which represents the voice of the Iraqi people.  Dr. Barham Ahmed Salih Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation Chairman of the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB)  Iraq's Strategic Vision for National Development  END TEXT  3. Text of Planning Minister Barham Saleh's Speech:  BEGIN TEXT  Speech by: Dr. Barham Ahmed Salih Minister of Planning & Development Cooperation Presented to the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IRAQ Brussels 21-22 June 2005 International Conference on Iraq, Brussels, Belgium -22 June 2005  Your Excellencies, Distinguished participants, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Let me start by thanking the United States and the European Union for co-hosting this International Conference on the future of Iraq here in the beautiful city of Brussels.  I would also like to thank all of you for participating in this important conference.  It shows the commitment of the international community to the future of the new Iraq. This conference is an excellent opportunity for the first democratically elected government of Iraq to share with the international community its Vision and aspirations for the future.  I would like to begin by discussing the role of development cooperation and planning as I see it in the reconstruction and development of Iraq.  By just looking at the title of my Ministry many of you will know that the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation is responsible for donor co-ordination within the Iraqi government.  That is correct. But not many of you will know that we are also responsible for setting Iraq's public investment priorities in consultation with line Ministries, disbursing the resources and monitoring investment performance.  In addition, we are also responsible for promoting private investment.  I also need to emphasize that we are NOT involved in central planning---far from it.  We believe in empowering local and regional authorities to participate in their OWN development by identifying their own priorities and choosing their own strategies.  We believe that decentralization is the key to development effectiveness. It brings decision-making to the grass-roots level ensuring transparency, greater accountability and eradicates corruption.  But what is the significance of having both investment and development co-operation under one roof?  We think it is important because it reflects our view that private and public investment are strategic complements that hold the key to a brighter future for Iraq.  We believe that investment is the key driver of economic growth and rising prosperity.  Working together, public and private investment create powerful synergies that are the spark for economic growth, igniting job creation and raising living standards.  Prudent public investment in water, health, electricity, roads, schools and security provides a conducive ground in which private investment can flourish.  This formula has worked all over the world-from the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East to Malaysia and South Korea in the Far East to Mauritius in Africa and right here in Europe which was rebuilt after World War II with massive investments from the Marshall Plan.  We are convinced that the same formula will work in Iraq. But what does Iraq need to do to attract both foreign and domestic investment and prudently manage public investments?  We need an enabling environment.  An enabling environment for investment is about partnership between governments and the private sector, sharing risks between them to be managed by those best placed to do so.  Such a partnership demands good governance, sound policies and capable institutions.  We have already achieved much in this area DESPITE the difficult transition marked by the crippling legacy of tyranny and the challenges of confronting terrorism.  - We have the lowest customs fees and the most open trading regime in the region. - We have the most business friendly laws on corporations, banking, securities, and foreign investment in the region. - We have a new stable currency backed by an independent central bank. - We have established a Commission on Public Integrity, along with Inspector Generals in each Ministry as part of a comprehensive approach to combat corruption. - We have started talks on joining the WTO, and signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. - We are also a democracy-albeit a fledgling one. These actions provide important signals to the global and local business community.  It signals that we are doing everything possible to lower business risks and keep it low. In this context, I am pleased to announce that the World Economic Forum will soon host a meeting in Geneva to rally the international business community in support of Iraq. But that is not all.  An enabling environment requires public investments in infrastructure and public investments in our people.  Even here we have been making some progress despite the utter devastation we inherited from the previous regime.  - Telecommunications have been expanded with mobile telephone networks, fixed lines and satellite televisions penetrating even the most remote parts of the country. - Our physical infrastructure is being rehabilitated. - Over 1,000 schools have been rebuilt.  This is all commendable but of course much more needs to be done.  We are just at the beginning of the journey to prosperity.  We need to restore and expand basic services- water and electricity-to all 26 million Iraqis.  We need to expand and modernize health care services and bring our air, road and rail networks into the twenty-first century. We need to close the digital divide and invest in science and technology to harness the ingenuity of our people. To do this we are allocating a huge portion of our resources to public investment.  Our investment budget for 2005-2007 is $28.6 billion,55 percent of which is to be financed from domestic revenues and 45 percent from grants and preferential long-term loans from donors.  This amounts to 27 percent of our total expenditures.  This high level of investment in the national budget constitutes roughly 33 percent of Gross Domestic Product and we estimate that it will produce an economic growth rate of 12 percent over the next three years.  This is the same level of investment that saw the Asian Tigers grow into prosperous countries within a generation.  But even that will not be enough to create an enabling environment for investment.  The government also needs to work differently - We will need to reduce public sector deficits, making sure that they do not crowd out private investments. - It demands, therefore, prudent fiscal policy and responsible fiscal management that are sustained credibly over time.  This is what my colleague the Minister of Finance has just spoken to you about. - Government credibility will require many tough choices such as how to reduce the burden on public finances of loss-making state owned enterprises, how to reform subsidies, how to deal with the enormous distortions of the Public Food Distribution System. - We have already begun to make these tough decisions. We will shortly announce a two-phase increase in fuel prices to gradually eliminate the subsidy element.  We are also committed to conducting pilot trials for monetization of the Public food distribution system so that we can learn what works and what doesn't. - The Minister of Finance and I are working closely together to introduce an Alaska type oil-dividend for Iraq. This will enable all Iraqis to share in the abundant natural resource wealth as provided for in our Transitional Administrative Law. - We are laying the groundwork for the privatization of state owned-enterprises and are fully committed to implementing all the macroeconomic and structural conditions in the EPCA Agreement including conducting a monetary survey and maintaining a single Treasury account. However, notwithstanding our best efforts, progress will be slow without productive and enhanced partnerships with the donor community. An enhanced partnership means finding ways to work better together.  It cannot be business as usual.  Like in every democracy, in Iraq today there is a sense of urgency to show tangible results.  Unless we can show the tangible benefits of a pluralistic, federal democratic, market economy, enemies of change will erode our attempts at reform.  The enhanced partnership will require BOTH better co-ordination among the donors and better coordination between the Iraqi government and the donors.  Otherwise, donor funds will be locked in a bureaucratic maze and never reach the people for whom it is intended.  This is already happening.  I was amazed to learn recently that of 90 million dollars in the World Bank Trust Fund for Iraq for emergency water supply ZERO has been disbursed.  Of 55 million dollars for private sector development ZERO has been disbursed.  Of 7 million dollars for capacity building only 300,000 had been spent.  This is unacceptable.  We need to do better.  The Iraqi side has to bear its share of the blame for this state of affairs.  We have started taking steps to reverse this situation. We are strengthening our capacity as the Government's lead agency for private sector development and investment planning and investment promotion in several ways.  - Through our Grant Aid Coordination Unit, the Ministry will strengthen its role as the point of contact for all donor coordination, to ensure the proper and effective allocation of all donor resources to the areas of highest priority. - We are strengthening our capacity to coordinate directly with the Ministry of Finance to integrate donor funding into the national budget, to ensure conformity with the overall budgetary framework. - We will improve our capacity to guide, assist and supervise sector Ministries in their national execution of donor-funded projects within their respective sectors, and coordinate between these Ministries and multilateral and bilateral financial and developmental organizations. - As Chair of the Council for International Coordination (CIC), I intend to recommend a new donor coordination mechanism that will be more inclusive, Iraqi-led, based in Baghdad. - We will operationalize a comprehensive Donor Assistance Database. - On the Donor side we need to work together with you to simplify and harmonize your policies, procedures and practices to minimize bureaucracy and delays in project implementation.  I met with many of your representatives on Saturday in Baghdad and look forward to working with them to improve our systems.  At the Donor Coordination Conference in Amman next month we will present concrete proposals for new donor coordination mechanisms to quickly eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and remove any bottlenecks to speedy project implementation.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  The Vision we have laid out for the new Iraq is bold and ambitious but with the support of the international community it is achievable.  But make no mistake the road ahead will be difficult.  The strategy, policies and actions to achieve the Vision will create winners and losers.  This fact challenges people with vested interests in the status quo.  It also challenges those with radically different political and economic views about the course or process of change.  Development is about change changing mind-sets, changing ways of doing business, eventually transforming society.  Therein lies the challenge of achieving lasting change in a pluralistic, democratic society.  Reconciling winners with losers, changing minds that have long been made-up, winning debates on the merits and encouraging innovative thinking to realize our Vision we need a sharp scaling-up of resources we need a new Marshall Plan for the new Iraq but we know that greater quantities of aid alone will NOT yield better results.  For aid to be effective it will need to be better coordinated among yourselves, properly aligned with national priorities, quickly disbursed and with tangible benefits rapidly accruing to the intended beneficiaries in Baghdad or Samawa or Mosul or Erbil.  Let me conclude with this appeal.  Iraq is a pivotal state in the Middle East and has the potential to use its huge natural resources and the dynamism and ingenuity of its peoples to make the world a better place for all.  We should be using our god-given assets to be donors for the development of less fortunate countries around the world. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of seeking aid from the international community. To return Iraq to its rightful place in the community of nations we need your help, and we need it NOW.  Please DO NOT DELAY. The time for action is NOW.  Your assistance is an INVESTMENT not only in the future of Iraq, but in the future of the Middle East and the entire community of nations.  The dividend from supporting Iraq NOW will be repaid many times over ----- and for generations to come (PAUSE) just as the dividend from the MARSHALL PLAN is still paying dividends today (PAUSE) it propelled Europe to greater prosperity than ever before, it is now helping Europe eradicate poverty around the world and promote peace and scuity fo all mnknd. adies and Getlemen  It worked in Europe it will work in Iraq.  Al-salaam Alaikum  I thank you  END TEXT  4.  TEXT OF Minister of Finance Ali Allawi's Speech  BEGIN TEXT  Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen . . .  It is a great honor to be here and to help renew the care for a free, independent, democratic, and prosperous Iraq.  The Iraqi state and economy was devastated by years of war and dictatorship.  What we inherited, after the collapse of the tyranny, was massive indebtedness, a dysfunctional state geared to war and oppression, and a hugely distorted and ill-operating economy.  The efforts needed to stop and then begin to redress this state of affairs are truly Herculean.  And this cannot be done without the full and effective participation of the world community.  The Iraqi Transitional Government, the first fully democratic, elected government in Iraq's history, is determined to tackle this legacy, within the terms of its mandate and its period in office.  The state of the Iraqi economy is fragile.  We are massively dependent on our oil revenues.  In the 2005 budget, oil revenues account for over 95% of governmental revenues, excluding grants.  Our oil exports are reliant on the effective operation of both our Northern and Southern oilfields, and while our level of exports, at 1.4 m b/day are lower than budgeted because of the closure of the Northern pipeline, the total revenues achieved are within budget because of higher oil prices.  The flow of grants and loans from the international community, which are essential for reconstruction, have not been within the expected levels.  The state continues to be the main employer and the level of unemployment is unacceptably high.  Public and private investment is running at about 30 percent of GDP is inadequate for maintaining the required level commensurate with the reconstruction needs of the country.  Transfers from the state budget, mainly in the form of huge subsidies for petroleum products, maintaining the food distribution system, and extremely low prices for utilities, are a great drain on the budget.  The defunct regime has burdened generations of Iraqis with debt levels of incredible proportions.  But the ITG is determined to tackle these issues head on, within our limited time frame of government.  We have, in the Ministry of Finance, in close partnership with the Central Bank of Iraq and the Ministry of Planning, set four basic goals for the ITG in the area of economic and financial reform.  Firstly, to maintain the momentum established by the Interim Iraqi Government to conclude debt reduction talks.  We have inherited over $125 billion of debt, as well as over $50 billion of compensation claims from the Gulf War. Resolution of Iraq's indebtedness is crucial for ensuring that economic revival commences in earnest.  A major step has been taken in this regard with the conclusion of a historic agreement with Paris Club creditors in November of 2004.  We have recently signed a number of bilateral agreements with Paris Club countries that confirm the framework agreement.  Here, I would like to express our thanks and appreciation for the US Government for its decision to write off all of Iraq's debt.  We are well advanced in preparing similar proposals for the categories of creditors, within the overall ceiling of Paris Club terms.  These would include commercial creditors, and other countries to which Iraq is indebted.  We recognize that the full application of the terms of the Paris Club agreement requires that we enter an agreement with the IMF for a Stand-by Agreement.  The Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq and I have had very extensive and, I believe, successful talks with the IMF earlier this month.  Secondly, the ITG is determined to confront the issues of subsidies and universal entitlements, and their deleterious effect on economic incentives, price structures, open market, corruption-free transactions, and a balanced budget.  But we are also aware that there could be large welfare implications for our people, and we shall structure these necessary changes in ways that would minimize the effect on our people, and in particular the large category of poor and disadvantaged people.  In this regard, the Ministry of Finance, is preparing a supplementary budget for the balance of 2005, whereby the process of removing petroleum subsidies will commence.  We are also implementing radical reforms in our financial management systems, to ensure that the quality and timeliness of our economic information is appropriate. This will also help us in improving the effectiveness of our decision-making, reducing the level of corruption, and making government accountable and transparent.  In the 2006 budget, which we are in the process of preparing for early October, we will announce a number of revenue generating measures, including specific actions to improve tax and duty collection.  This will broaden our revenue base, but will not and cannot replace the fact that we are an oil-dependent economy for the foreseeable future. Large commitment must continue to be made to the oil sector, in order to sustain and increase our level of production and exports.  We are budgeting for 2006 an improvement in our present level of exports to about 1.8 million b/day with buoyant oil prices.  But our budgeted revenues cannot possibly meet the level of current and future capital expenditures without significant support in the form of grants and loans from the international community.  It is here that we sincerely hope that the commitments made in the Madrid Conference be re- affirmed, activated, and extended.  The ITG will also, as a matter of urgency, tackle the vital issue of banking sector reform.  Our banks, especially state-owned institutions which dominate the banking sector, must be modernized and made to operate as essential units for mobilizing savings, maintaining an effective payments system, and ensure the flow of credit to businesses and entrepreneurs.  The prospects for Iraq, in the medium-term, are extremely bright.  Iraq's dilemma is one of the near-term.  We have to reconstruct our political life, our economy, and our civil society.  This is truly underway.  Once these foundations are established, then Iraq's reintegration into the global economy will be swift and we will regain our rightful place in the community of open, democratic, and prosperous nations.

Ford for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY.  SRSG Qazi told CODEL Levin on July 5 that the Sunni have finally joined the Constitution Committee as members and technical advisors.  He stated that Sheik Hammoudi, committee chairman, confirmed to him that all decisions, including approval of the final draft, will be done by consensus and not by voting, a factor favorable to Sunni inclusion.  Qazi opined that the constitution could be completed on time, but must include the possibility for amendment.  Finally, Qazi stressed that the UN and international donors "have our work cut out for us," stressing that the constitution will be beneficial to all Iraqis, with failure as the worst possible option.  END SUMMARY  --------------------------------------------- ---- SUNNI PARTICIPATION ON THE CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE --------------------------------------------- ----  2.  (C/NF) UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) Ashraf Qazi told CODEL Levin on July 5 that the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) finally agreed to accept the list of 15 Sunni delegates and 13 technical advisors to participate on the TNA's Constitution Committee.  This is certainly a positive move, observed Qazi, as low Sunni participation at the successful January elections eventually had a negative impact on the constitution process.  Qazi stated that the lack of an identifiable Sunni leadership created problems in determining which Sunni were truly representative and should be on the list.  Qazi opined that the committee's decision process, favoring consensus over unanimity, would prove favorable for enhancing Sunni participation.  3.  (C/NF) Qazi explained that he had spoken to committee chairman Sheik Humam Hammoudi, who confirmed the consensus style for committee decision-making.  He said that Hammoudi said the optics of Sunni Arab participation, not the actual number of Sunni Arabs, was important.  Qazi explained that progress with the constitution drafting depended on three important points:  Sunni Arab presence, consensus-style agreement, and the need for the TNA to resist changing the committee's final decision on the draft constitution.  Qazi explained that the basic draft of the constitution would contain about 80 to 85 percent generally agreed upon basic language, leaving the final 15 to 20 percent that will be more difficult find agreement.  He expected the constitution would reflect a parliamentary government, with both a Prime Minister and a President.  Qazi added that the Sunni hope for a strong constitutional president, an office they covet but will, in all likelihood, never hold.  4.  (C/NF) In response to Sen. Levin's question regarding meeting the draft deadline, Qazi could not state with confidence whether or not the draft would be completed and accepted by the TNA by August 15.  He explained that each major party has its own reasons for meeting, or failing to meet, that deadline, depending on whether or not the party hopes for new elections to restart the drafting exercise, or new elections to implement the new constitution.   For the constitution to pass at referendum, Qazi stated that it must be in a form that can be amended to allow more work on the most difficult issues after the new assembly is seated.  "We have our work cut out for us," opined Qazi, indicating that the UN and the international community must work together and synchronize our policy messages in order to help Iraq succeed in this process.  --------------------------------------------- -- JULY 15 FIRST DRAFT, SUBMISSIONS, AND INDONESIA --------------------------------------------- --  5.  (C/NF) SRSG Qazi commented on the following topics:  -- DEPARTURE OF COALITION FORCES: When asked if the Sunni Arabs want the Coalition Forces to depart, Qazi stated that, in principle, they want the military to leave, but realize that a premature departure would lead to greater security problems.  The Shi'a, on the other hand, want the forces to remain, as they fear the Coalition is the only deterrent to the Sunni Arabs from retaking control.  -- CONSTITUTION WITHOUT THE SUNNI: Stressing their key participatory role, Qazi emphasized that the actual constitution text was less important than the drafting process.  He said that participation by the Iraqi people was essential, including submitting comments prior to the final draft, in order to fully claim ownership of the constitution.  He opined that a July 15 rough draft was not only possible, but also necessary in order to increase public participation. -- POLITICAL TRUST AND THE INSURGENCY: Qazi stated that the level of trust between political parties was very low, a factor which continues to impede political cooperation.  Regarding the impact of the constitution on the insurgency, Qazi stated that a successful constitution will likely have a favorable impact, but it will not be automatic, and it will be interlinked with other current issues facing Iraq.  -- UN AND INDONESIA MILITARY SUPPORT IN IRAQ: Senator Levin asked Qazi if the UN would be willing to request Indonesian military support to Iraq, especially since this would increase the Muslim presence for the coalition in Iraq.  Qazi replied that the UN has not made specific requests to individual countries, but he offered to research the issue to determine if such a request could be considered under UNSCR 1546.  6.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002856  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PTER, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab, National Assembly SUBJECT: HARD-LINE SUNNI ARAB GROUP URGES U.S. STAY IN IRAQ  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert S. Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) Summary.  A Sunni Coalition that had gained prominence in the negotiations for government positions and Sunni participation in the constitutional drafting process lobbied visiting Senator Levin on July 5 for a continued presence of Coalition Forces.  They complained bitterly of abuses allegedly committed by the Iraqi Security Forces while they also perceive the steady marginalization of Iraq's Sunni Arab community by the Shia/Kurdish majority.  Two of Senator Levin's guests are on the Constitution Committee and they said they would push hard to see the constitution draft finished by August so that national elections can be held in December. However, they said it would be hard to find agreement on constitutional treatment of federalism, the role of religion and the state and the structure of the future state.  They recommended resolution of these contentious issues be put off until later.  (Our Shia and Kurdish contacts dismiss this idea, saying they will be able to reach a deal on the full set of constitution issues.)  As groups like these Sunni hard-liners engage more on a political track, we find they are thinking more creatively - but not necessarily more realistically yet.  End Summary.  ------------ Participants ------------  2.  (SBU) List of participants:  Dr. Saleh Mutlak, Middle Democratic Party and Spokesman for the National Dialogue Council, holds a PhD in Agricultural Economics from Aberdeen, Scotland; member of Constitution Committee.  He is an Arab nationalist but left the Baath party 20 years ago.  Dr. Makhmood Mashhadani, Salafist and medical doctor with the Ministry of Health; member of Constitution Committee.  Sheikh Abdul Nassir Yousef Janabi, Secretary for the National Dialogue Council and Administrative Head of the Sufi Committee, holds a Masters in Sharia law.  Dr. Fakhri Kaissy, Secretary of the Salafi Higher Committee for the issuance of Fatwas, Professor in the School of Dentistry.  ---------------------------------------- Constitution: Meeting August 15 Deadline ----------------------------------------  3.  (C) National Dialogue and, now, Constitutional Drafting Committee members Drs. Saleh Mutlak and Makhmood Mashhadani both expressed their desire to meet the rapidly approaching constitution drafting deadline, if only to prevent an extension granting the current government more time in office.  Mutlak highlighted that several complex issues require more time than the few remaining weeks, but nothing should delay the next elections.  He proposed leaving the most contentious issues until a new Assembly is seated in January, producing -- instead -- a temporary constitution by August.  He argued that the three most difficult issues: the system of government (i.e. presidential versus prime ministerial), federalism and the role of religion 'require more participation' by all groups.  (Comment:  By contrast, our Shia and Kurdish contacts, while acknowledging that these issues are contentious, think an agreement about even these issues is possible by August 15.  End Comment.)  --------------------------------------------- ---- Coalition Forces: Should We Stay or Should We Go? --------------------------------------------- ----  4.  (C) Mutlak warned that if the Americans leave at this time, Iraq faced real danger from its neighbors. The presence of U.S. troops, he emphasized, was a source of pressure on their Sunni constituents, but the withdrawal of forces to bases outside the cities would mitigate this.  Sheikh Abdul Nasser stated that the violence would not end 'as long as the Americans are here'; in his next breath, he said to withdraw now was a mistake.  Mashhadani claimed that a complete withdrawal was contrary to U.S. national interests. Identifying himself as a part of the Salafist movement, he identified a dilemma:  on the one hand, 'from a legal point of view and representing a religious community', Salafists cannot argue for a continued CF presence.  Nonetheless, from a realistic perspective, he observed 'we need them'.  He argued against setting a date for a complete pullout, claiming the U.S. had the 'moral responsibility' to secure the welfare of the Iraqi people.  --------------------------------------------- Preparing for an Eventual American Withdrawal ---------------------------------------------  5.  (C) Sheikh Abdul Nasser suggested the U.S. announce plans for an eventual withdrawal and make a 'token' withdrawal of 10,000 troops to convince the insurgents the U.S. was not here to stay.  He said, however, that any complete withdrawal must be preceded by the conclusion of a U.S.-Iraqi security agreement, in which the U.S. commits to protecting Iraq against its neighbors.  The way forward, according to Janabi, is for Sunni leaders to convince their constituents, based on a token withdrawal and signed security agreement, that the Americans only seek democracy in Iraq.  Mashhadani said the signal (by the token withdrawal) that the U.S. intends to leave should be combined with serious negotiations with the insurgents.  He recommended that over a gradual period of one or two years, the U.S. could continue to withdraw while standing up the Iraqi security Forces (ISF).  --------------------------- Negotiating with Insurgents ---------------------------  6.  (C) Mashhadani claimed that 80 percent of the resistance could be won over by serious ('without impediments') inclusion in the political process. Even elements of the remaining 20 percent could be enticed into ending the violence.  Convincing the Sunni community to lay down their arms was hard, according to Mashhadani, due to their lack of access to media outlets.  He said Sunni Arabs' have no newspaper, no satellite TV, no resources', while the Kurds and Shia basically have their own states and are using this position to solidify their gains.  He said negotiating with the insurgents might surprise the U.S., in that they might ask the CF to stay. (Comment:  It is not surprisingly that these hard-line Sunni Arabs would welcome direct negotiations between the U.S. and the insurgents.  They also hope the U.S. will pressure the ITG on behalf of Sunni Arab grievances.  By contrast, the National Assembly, dominated by Shia and Kurds, earlier this week denounced the idea of any negotiations with the "Baathist insurgents."  End Comment.)  ----------------------------------------- Sunni Participation in Upcoming Elections -----------------------------------------  7.  (C) Mutlak said the continued raids and detentions in Sunni Arab communities in Baghdad and throughout the triangle could adversely affect voter turnout among Sunni Arabs.  He pressed for U.S. support of moderates, conceding some Shia were also moderates. Nonetheless, Mutlak observed that the Sunni face immense obstacles, noting they cannot get out to speak to their constituents and their cities are being hit everyday.  Sheikh Abdul Nasser proposed delaying Saddam Hussein's trial until after the elections or transferring his case to the International Court of Criminal Justice, stating the former dictator still commands the support of over one million Iraqis.  --------------------------------------- Sunni Paranoia: Doesn't Mean They're Not Out To Get Them ----------------------------------------  8.  (C) Mashhadani noted that there are widening gaps between the Sunni community and the Americans, which are fomented by the expatriate Iraqis who currently run the government.  Their goal, he opined, was to destroy the Sunni community.  Mashhadani warned that if the U.S. left Iraq without 'restoring it to its original position,' America's enemies would fill these gaps.  (Comment.  Several of the group repeated this word 'eradication' during the conversation, a new term in our discussions with them.  It highlights their feeling that they are in a tenuous position, as CF and ISF operations pressure Sunni Arab communities, 'Zarqawis' threaten them for their political activity and finally, and most significantly, they continue to be outwitted and outmaneuvered by the Shia/Kurdish majority in the game of politics.  While they have their representation on the Constitutional Drafting Committee, it is not clear they will come up with a deal acceptable to them.  End Comment.)  ------------------------ The Rise of Sectarianism ------------------------  9.  (C) Mashhadani bemoaned the fact that since the fall of the regime, religion has become politicized. He said he has no disagreement with the 'Iraqi Shia,' that there had not existed a 'religious crisis' (sectarianism) until the end of the regime.  Sheikh Abdul Nasser observed that 80-90 percent of the Arab World is Sunni, and that they are committed to protecting their Sunnis in Iraq.  This, he claimed, was demonstrated by the influx of foreign fighters or jihadists into the country.  He said these fellow Sunnis have concluded that the Shia aim to eradicate Iraqi Sunnis.  (Comment:  In fact, public statements from Mashadani and Janabi frequently inflame sectarian antagonisms here.  End Comment.)  --------------------- Iraqi Security Forces ---------------------  10.  (C) Sheikh Abdul Nasser said that only a reconstituted Iraqi Army could prevent the 'excesses' perpetuated by the current Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police.  He noted Sunnis hope that the Americans detain them -- rather than the ISF - because Americans are less likely to commit abuses.  Mahmood claimed that the ISF has adopted Saddam's approach, 'go out and eradicate.'  He claimed the ISF tortures detainees, citing the discovery of the bodies of former detainees with holes drilled by power tools.  11.  (C) Comment.  The National Dialogue is a relatively new faction in the murky and fractious Sunni political landscape.  It rose to prominence during the prolonged maneuvering for Sunni inclusion the government, and most recently the Constitutional drafting process.  In what should have been a victorious moment (at the same time as this meeting the Transitional National Assembly's Constitutional Drafting Committee was to have hosted their latest members Mutlak and Mashhadani to lunch) the National Dialogue appeared apprehensive about the future. Their hyperbole about Iraqi security forces notwithstanding, there are documented cases of hard- line opposition Sunni Arab imams being detained by men in security uniforms, tortured and murdered.  In response, the Dialog Council members raised with Senator Levin an appeal for Coalition Forces not to withdraw and the desire to secure a security agreement.  Mutlak, for one, has come 180 degrees on this point; six months ago he vehemently demanded the immediate withdrawal of CF.

(C) ITG detainee-transition point-of-contact Sharwan al-Waely met with Embassy and MNF-I representatives on June 5, 2005 to discuss ITG legal authorities to conduct security detentions (see reftel).  The conversation with al-Waely indicated that the ITG, despite the USG's repeated briefings to senior leadership, is unfamiliar with the scale, legal basis, and procedures of current Coalition detention operations, and thus faces a steep learning curve on this issue.  2.  (C) Al-Waely did not appear ready to concede that security detentions (by MNF-I or, potentially, by the Iraqi government) play a necessary role in fighting the insurgency.  In our second meeting, to be held July 11, we plan to present a briefing on the demographics of and the security threat posed by the Coalition-held detainee population.  We will re-focus discussion on Iraq's legal authorities at a third meeting provisionally scheduled for July 18.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  3.  (C) In reftel, the Department requested that the Embassy initiate discussions with the ITG to determine the legal basis for the ITG to play a greater role in detention operations in 2005 and beyond.  On May 28, the Charge d'Affaires raised this issue with PM Ja'afari; on several other occasions, PolMilCouns and MNF-I raised the issue informally with the PM.  4.  (C) In response, on June 8, the PM's spokesman, Laith Kubba, informed PolMilCouns that the PM had designated Da'wa party member and TNA representative Sharwan al-Waely (also a member of the Constitutional Committee) as the ITG point of contact for this issue. We attempted to contact Mr. al-Waely immediately; however, he initially was unresponsive, and later left the country for ten days.  On his return, we set up a July 5 meeting.  ------------------ JULY 5 DISCUSSIONS ------------------  5.  (C) Representatives of MNF-I Detainee Operations and Embassy Legal and Pol-Mil held their first meeting with Mr. al-Waely at the Baghdad Convention Center on July 5, 2005.  Mr. al-Waely attended the meeting alone, but indicated that he intends to increase the size of the ITG delegation for our next scheduled discussion.  He mentioned that he would assemble individuals who deal with legal, security, and political issues.  6.  (C) Mr. al-Waely opened the meeting by noting that he was a lawyer as well as a TNA member; that the Prime Minister had authorized him to be in charge of this issue; and that he had headed a similar committee on Sadr detainees before the ITG was formed.  He quickly noted that detention operations were a sensitive issue "after the events of Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca," and in view of recent accusations about abuses by the Ministry of Interior.  7.  (C) He also requested that MNF-I present him with a list of all detainees in Coalition custody, indexed with each detainee's status before the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB) and/or Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI), to enable him to answer inquiries from "people missing loved ones."  8.  (C) (NOTE: MNF-I provides this list every thirty days to the Iraqi Ministry of Justice on CD-ROM; the fact that PM Ja'afari's aide Bashar al-Naher also asked recently for the same list, equally unaware that the ITG already had a copy, is indicative of the apparent lack of information-sharing on Coalition detention issues within the ITG.)  9.  (C) Mr. al-Waely posed a number of questions, apparently based on his impression that the size of the current detainee population was related to bureaucratic or otherwise unreasonable delays in detainee releases.  It was, he suggested, a violation of detainees' human rights to hold them for lengthy periods pending trial if the delay were due to the under-capacity of the Iraqi court or prison systems.  10.  (C) At one point, Mr. al-Waely asked for the names of the CRRB members and appeared to be interested in a bulk release of detainees held in temporary divisional facilities to create political capital.  (PolMilOff explained that MNF-I does not "store up" these detainees for release, but rather releases them on a rolling basis, as and when it is determined that they do not pose an imperative threat to security.)  11.  (C) Embassy Legal raised the impending need to consider how to deal with high-threat detainees who could not be prosecuted criminally but who Iraq and the Coalition would not want to see released when UNSCR 1546 authorities expire.  Mr. al-Waely was dismissive, saying that detainees were innocent until proven guilty, and that Iraqi law did not permit internment other than short periods of judicial detention pending court investigation.  12. (C) Embassy Legal discussed the international practice of security internment, noting the existence in UK and Indian law of such emergency authorities, as well as the fact that those authorities provide a number of safeguards against arbitrary or unreviewed detentions.  Embassy Pol-MilOff offered concrete examples of high-risk security internees whose release would pose a significant threat to Iraqi security, especially if large numbers of releases were to occur simultaneously upon the expiration of UNSCR 1546.  13.  (C) In response, Mr. al-Waely noted that this was "beautiful talk," but invited the USG delegation to look at it from a politician's point of view.  Media reports and investigations of abuses committed at Abu Ghraib, and "illegal things Coalition Forces are doing" elsewhere had made detention problematic "in the hearts and minds of Iraqis."  14.  (C) Mr. al-Waely commented that while he realized there were many hardened criminals in the Coalition detainee population, there were also many who were innocent; some, he claimed, had been falsely accused or reported to MNF-I by their Iraqi neighbors. "That's why we need to put some sort of less complicated system in place," he said.  15.  (C) Mr. al-Waely suggested that individual voting members of the CRRB attend the next meeting, apparently with an eye to discussing the members' (confidential) retain-or-release votes.  MNF-I and EmbOffssuggested that Mr. al-Waely contact the Deputy Ministers at the Board's ministerial components (Interior, Justice, and Human Rights) instead.  16.  (C) In closing, Legal noted that the issue of high-threat security internees and their post-UNHCR- 1546 status was a critical issue for both Iraq and the Coalition, and that it was important for discussions to begin earlier rather than later.  Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. al-Waely agreed with this statement, noting that the problem was one for both Iraq and the United States.  --------- WAY AHEAD ---------  16.   (C) At our second meeting, scheduled for July 11, EmbOffs and MNF-I intend to brief an expanded Iraqi delegation on the size, characteristics, and threat level of the MNF-I detainee population, as well as on current Coalition legal authorities and procedural processes, with the intent of creating a common starting-place for our discussion of current (and possibly future) Iraqi legal authorities.  17.  (C) At our third meeting, scheduled to take place on July 18, we hope to return to the issue of current and potential Iraqi authority to detain security internees.  We will report the results of each meeting. Satterfield

Reason 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  Kirkuk Provincial Council met June 26 and 28, but postponed electing a Deputy Governor.  U.S. urging to secure Kurdish leaders' agreement to a Kirkuk "consensus government" that includes Arabs and Turkmen had apparently not yet been conveyed by July 3 to Kirkuk players.  Although still lacking a complete leadership lineup, the Council began moving ahead on committee formation, including a committee to liaise with the Kurdistan government.  Meanwhile PM Ja'aferi's public remarks regarding the resolution of Kirkuk issues prompted stern rebukes from Kurdish leaders, with steadily hardening demands of their own, new propaganda salvos, and maximum bombast from the region's ethnically dominated media.  It has become impossible to untangle the chicken-and-egg cycle of hyperbole, accusations, and hardening positions on Kirkuk's government and status.  There is much apprehension among minority groups, including Christians, that serious consequences may follow an entirely Kurd-nominated government.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  Talabani Says He Will Push Barzani to Accept "Real" Arabs and Turkmen -------------------------------------  2.  (C) As factions debated Kirkuk Provincial Council outcomes in both Kirkuk and Kurdistan cities, Charge d'Affaires Satterfield continued to press key leaders in Baghdad on the need for consensus, giving leadership jobs to both elected Arab and Turkmen blocs.  Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told charge June 28 he had managed to get Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani to agree to including the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) in the Council (as Deputy Governor).  Barzani was still resisting including Arabs in the Council.  (NOTE:  Barzani told REO/Kirkuk in December that he hoped Arabs of Kirkuk would not vote in elections.  END NOTE.)  Confusion Reigns: Conditions Imposed on Turkmen Candidates? --------------------------------------------- --  3.  (C) Meanwhile, at the provincial level, there was no sign of progress.  During the June 28 Council meeting, 23 Kirkuk Brotherhood List (KBL) members agreed they should give Turkmen another week to select a candidate for the position of Deputy Governor (i.e., until July 4).  Mohamed Kamal, Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) caucus chair, said that any Turkmen deputy governor would have to accept Article 58 of the TAL, which he interpreted to mean Kirkuk is part of Kurdistan.  Sherzad Adil (KDP) suggested that the Deputy Governor be selected from the KBL.  Babakir Sadeq Ahmed, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), countered that Turkmen view the ITF as their most legitimate mouthpiece; therefore that bloc should nominate a deputy governor candidate.  (Comment:  This is in accord with what Jalal Talabani told the Charge June 28 in Baghdad.  End Comment.)  4.  (U) PUK-affiliated newspaper al-Ittihad reported June 28 that Council Chairman Rizgar Ali Hamajan had also stated that a deputy governor nominee must accept that Kirkuk is part of Kurdistan.  On July 2 Kirkuk PolOff contacted Rizgar Ali who said the story was false; he denied that this was a prerequisite for nomination.  Ali noted that the KBL wants the Deputy Governor to be "100 percent Turkmen" (read ITF), support implementation of all articles of the TAL (including Article 58), and promote harmony between all ethnicities.  (Comment:  There is no consensus, even among various Kurdish parties, on what exactly Article 58 requires.  End Comment.)  Committee Formation Commences -----------------------------  5.  (SBU) Rizgar Ali prompted members to move forward with committee nominations, and tabled suggestions for committees on security; construction and development; and liaison to the Kurdistan National Assembly (KNA). Kirkuk Regional Coordinator (RC), concerned that committee formations would preempt possible agreement by Turkmen and Arabs to return to the Council, on June 27 sent a letter to Governor Abdulrahman Mustafa requesting that the Council not act on committees until there is agreement on leadership posts.  The letter also sought the Governor's view on the authority for the Provincial Council to elect Kirkuk's city mayor (on June 21), as Coalition Provisional Authority Order 71 stipulates that the municipal council elects the mayor.  6.  (SBU) Arab council member Mohamed Khalil told PolOff June 27 that the Arabs will continue to boycott Provincial Council meetings until the mayor is fairly elected and the new Arab Assistant Governor is removed and replaced with an Arab who represents the Sunni bloc in the Council.  Christian Fear --------------  7.  (SBU) In a meeting June 25 with the RC and PolOff, newly-elected Assistant Governor Edward Oraham (independent Chaldo-Assyrian), speculated that if Turkmen and Arabs did not each get key slots in government, violence would escalate, with dire consequences for Kirkuk's small Christian community. He felt that the Turkmen would not take up arms, but would remain neutral if Sunni Arabs increased their tolerance of Foreign Resistance Elements (FRE) in the province.  He offered to relinquish his seat to either bloc in the interests of keeping the peace.  He told RC that the KDP had vetoed other Christian candidates for his job, and that he himself could not step too far from established Kurdish party lines.  National Leaders Call for Delaying Kirkuk, Prompting Kurdish Outrage -----------------------------------  8.  (C) Baha Al-Araji, Shia Arab Sadrist and Secretary of the Constitutional Drafting Committee told Radio Sawa June 26 that Kirkuk will not be discussed in the context of the constitution, because it is too sensitive to resolve now.  He also expressed hope that the Kurds will accept consensus to keep Kirkuk outside any federal regions.  (Comment: PUK leader and Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Fuad Ma'asum also told PolOff on July 5, that he does not believe the constitution should address Kirkuk.  His reasoning for this was quite different from Araji's, however: Ma'asum said he believes that Article 58 should be largely implemented by the time the next elections take place so the constitution should not need to address the issue.  End Comment.)  Kurdish language internet site Payanmar on June 29 reported that Iraqi PM Ja'afari told Mideast newspaper in London that while Kurds were mistreated and pushed out of the province and Arabs brought in, Ja'aferi said solutions must be acceptable to all parties.  9.  (SBU) In a swift reaction, KDP politburo and KNA member Othman Mahmood said June 30 that United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) "wants to delay Kirkuk resolution until after the constitution . . . the only loser will be Kurdish people."  He accused the UIA of violating the principles of the Shia-Kurd agreement of March.  Other steps to counter Baghdad calls for delay of the process were more tangible.  USAID and REO staff traveling between Kirkuk and Irbil June 30 noted large new banners and posters along the highway claiming, "Kirkuk is part of Kurdistan."   Satterfield

BAGHDAD 2694      B. BAGHDAD 2787      C. BAGHDAD 2790 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY.  The ITG is increasingly concerned about attacks to its oil infrastructure. Security has become a priority in recent ITG Cabinet-level meetings.  DPM Chalabi has led extensive ministerial discussions in the National Energy Council, consisting of the Ministers of Oil, Electricity, Water Resources, Industry and Minerals, Finance, Interior, and Defense attempting to find a solution to the infrastructure security problems in Iraq.  Based on our analysis, Iraq has lost over $19 billion in oil export revenues, a significant portion of which is a direct result of insurgent activity from June 2003 through May 2005. Actual export volumes during this two-year period averaged 1.32 million barrels per day; well below our estimate of Iraq's export capacity of 2.4 million barrels per day. The primary causes of this reduction are the insurgency, looting, and an aged infrastructure.  There were over 500 interdictions against oil production and pipeline systems between June 2003 and May 2005. The direct losses to the country are both the foregone export revenues and the cost of repairing the attack damage.  Additional indirect losses include lost productivity, loss of potential gains from capital investments, and foregone infrastructure improvements.  END SUMMARY  --------------------------------------------- ----------- IRAQI GOVERNMENT CONCERNED ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY --------------------------------------------- -----------  2.  (C) Iraq continues to face enormous reconstruction and economic development needs.  At the same time, its main source of revenue -- oil exports, accounting for 95 percent of revenues in the 2005 budget, according to Finance Minister Allawi, are dropping, primarily due to insurgent attacks.  As a result, Iraq will need to address a potentially serious financing gap in 2005 - one that by some estimates could amount to $2-3 billion.  Against this backdrop, DPM Ahmed Chalabi has led extensive ministerial discussions in the National Energy Council (NEC), consisting of the Ministers of Oil (MOO), Electricity, Water Resources, Industry and Minerals, Finance, Interior, and Defense (MOD), in an attempt to find a way to better protect Iraq's oil infrastructure and increase production and exports. (reftels)  3.  (C) The NEC has attempted to find a least-cost solution to providing infrastructure security for the oil pipelines in the north.  They have authorized the establishment, funding, and training of four Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIBS) under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. These units are composed of tribal recruits from the vicinity of the Kirkuk to Bayji corridor.  The ITG has had little success in improving infrastructure protection with these units, and the level of successful interdictions has increased.  This has resulted in much talk in Baghdad between the NEC and the MOD, but no results in the field (REF B).  4.  (C) The DPM and the NEC ministers are frustrated with the MOD, and their inability to use the still few fully mission-capable Iraqi Army units to secure the infrastructure, which are deployed by MNF-I to protect Iraqi population centers from direct attacks by insurgents and terrorists.  The DPM and NEC ministers do not want to use the tribal forces, and do not believe there will be any near-term success using tribal based forces in the form of the MOD plan based on the SIBS.  (REF A, B, C). The DPM has frequently stated the cost for the lack of security in the form of lost export revenue exceeds $500 million per month, and that security could be funded for a fraction of that amount.  The DPM said he would consult with MNFI to request assistance to solve this problem.  The Minister of Oil, in his meeting with the Charge' on July 1, repeated the theme of asking that trained Iraqi Army units currently under MNF-I's control be tasked to guard the northern oil infrastructure with MNFI assistance (septel). The NEC, on July 4, was informed by the MOD of a proposed plan to allocate Iraqi Army forces to assist in providing infrastructure security for the northern pipelines.  This plan is under development at this time and proposes the use of two Iraqi Army battalions under the control of the 4th Iraqi Division in Kirkuk until new units can be formed and trained (septel).   --------------------------------------------- ----- HISTORY OF INSURGENT ATTACKS ON OIL INFRASTRUCTURE --------------------------------------------- -----  5. (C) Iraq's oil production capability in May 2003, at the conclusion of combat operations, was nearly what it was before the war began in March 2003. We did not intentionally target the oil infrastructure during the war, recognizing the importance of its contribution to stability and future reconstruction efforts.  There were a few unintended exceptions including the bridge at Al Fathah, which carried the main northern export pipeline.  We did bomb the bridge, and unfortunately interdicted the entire export capacity of the Kirkuk oil fields, as well as the supply fuel line for the Bayji power plant and refinery.  6. (C) The insurgent interdiction of the oil infrastructure began in earnest in May 2003 with attacks along the strategic pipelines in the south and north.  From the beginning of the war through June 2003, looting of oil field and plant facilities, which has degraded Iraq's oil infrastructure and has contributed to the loss in export revenues, and worker absenteeism, attributed primarily to personal security concerns, disrupted exports particularly in the south.  From June 2003 through May 2005 there were over 500 insurgent-related interdictions of oil infrastructure. Although the average number of monthly attacks declined between January and May 2005, the volume of lost exports increased, which seems to indicate the insurgents have become more effective, getting more 'buck' for their 'bang'.  7. (SBU) Oil production, pipeline, storage, and exporting facilities are anywhere from 25 to 70 years old and deteriorating.  Iraq's oil infrastructure has undergone many years of frugal operating practices and a lack of maintenance.   The dilapidated state of the infrastructure contributes to a lesser, but no less critical, degree to the drop in exports. It is difficult to isolate the effects of deterioration from the effects of insurgency activity. However, it would not be unrealistic to conclude that these systems could have been improved over this same time given a more secure environment.  ---------------------------- VALUE OF IRAQ'S LOST EXPORTS ----------------------------  8. (C) We estimate the direct costs from lost revenue due to oil infrastructure interdiction (including looting, theft, and insurgent attacks) to be $19.1 billion for the two years June 2003 through May 2005.  Lost export revenues are $19.1 billion and repair costs are $64 million.  Of $19.1 billion, only 95 percent would have been available to the government of Iraq because of the requirement to pay 5 percent of revenues to Kuwait as war reparations.  ----------------------- IRAQ'S EXPORT POTENTIAL -----------------------  9. (C) We estimate Iraq's total current potential export volume at 2.4 million barrels of oil per day (mbbl/d); 2.1 mbbl/d from southern exports and 0.3 mbbl/d from the northern route. We define potential exports as the volume of oil that Iraq could export given the following five assumptions: normal wear and tear, unlimited export demand, and an increased domestic consumption of crude oil. We assume that all planned maintenance, capital improvements, and investments were executed.  We also assume that it is appropriate to use actual market prices for the period, concluding that world prices for Basra Light and Kirkuk crude would not be significantly different in either case.  Note that if we arbitrarily reduced Iraq's potential exports by 20 percent, to 1.96 mbbl/d, losses still would have exceeded $15 billion.  10. (SBU) We estimated potential export revenues by multiplying the potential monthly volumes for each type of oil by the monthly average of the daily actual prices of each, adding back marginal production cost, and subtracting the risk discount.   Actual export revenues are estimated in the same manner by multiplying the actual monthly volumes for each type of oil by the monthly average of the daily actual prices of each. Finally, total lost export revenue is calculated by taking the difference between potential and actual export revenues, adding back lifting costs and subtracting the total risk discount. The Iraqi's have been required to offer a risk discount per barrel of oil during the period of insurgency.  Estimates range from between $0.20 and $0.50 per barrel and are attribute to the unreliability of supply.   11. (C) Although they represent a small contribution to direct cost, repair costs are nonetheless relevant to our analysis.  PCO estimates the value of the TD Williamson contract, which supported emergency repair of pipelines, at $59M.  After this contract expired, the Emergency Response Pipeline Repair Operation (ERPRO) paid for repairs, and PCO estimates the total receipts from those repairs are $5M. Thus, the total spent by the USG for repairs is $64M plus any expenses incurred by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for which we do not have an estimate. Significantly, however, only 10 percent of all repairs were paid for by the USG. The Iraqis paid for the rest at a lower cost per repair.  -------------- INDIRECT COSTS --------------  12. (SBU) The indirect costs of terrorist attacks on oil infrastructure may be difficult to identify and even more challenging to value, but they could also be greater in magnitude than the direct components.  If we measured the effect of insurgent interdiction in terms of a loss in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a loss in export revenues, the result would likely exceed our reported estimate because of the effect of a government spending multiplier. Productivity losses accumulate from the interruption of normal business operations and the requirement to divert labor and capital.  There are potentially very larges losses of gains from capital improvements and investment.  Various sources, including the Ministry of Oil, indicated that planned but unrealized investments by domestic and foreign sources would have yielded significant increases in daily production.  Most investors remain reluctant to commit exploration and development funds, in part, because of the lack of security.  ---------------- FUTURE POTENTIAL ----------------  13. (C) The loss of so much revenue is almost impossible to compensate for.   However, we can forecast the volume of exports that might be possible given an end to insurgent attacks and the completion of the Ministry of Oil's plans for infrastructure improvements.  First, we estimate that if the northern strategic pipeline system is secured, then Iraq could immediately increase its exports by 300,000 barrels per day.  In addition, the Minister of Oil estimated that the northern oil field systems could be improved to provide a gradual increase over the next 6 months of an additional 200,000 barrels per day, and that beginning in January 2006 it could do similar infrastructure improvements in the south that would eventually yield an additional 300,000 barrels of oil per day.  This would yield 800,000 bbl/d of increased production available for export. (septel). ------- COMMENT -------  14. (C) COMMENT.  From our study and analysis, the ITG is correct to be so deeply concerned with the lack of security for the key infrastructure of Iraq.  In this brief analysis, we have attempted to quantify the lost revenues resulting from interdictions and the opportunity costs of a failure to adequately protect Iraq's oil infrastructure. The discussions at the NEC (reftels) demonstrate the Iraqi leadership's concern on the lack of infrastructure security and the costs to Iraq. The continued loss of oil revenues threatens the viability of Iraq's reconstruction, recovery and development -- and ultimately, its stability.    END COMMENT  15.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002862  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED  TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, IZ SUBJECT: KIRKUK: US, UK ENGAGE KIRKUK ETHNIC GROUPS TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT  Ref:  Baghdad 2746 Baghdad 2860  This is a REO Kirkuk cable.  1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  U.S. Kirkuk Regional Embassy Office Coordinator (RC) and UK Acting Consul General called on Arab, Turkmen, and Kurdish blocs of the Kirkuk Provincial Council July 3 and 4 to urge them to form a consensus government.  The Turkmen and Arab blocs say they will remain engaged in the political process if they obtain four key government posts -- deputy governor, mayor, appointments committee chairman, and reconstruction committee chairman, and have a say in balancing appointments to the director generalships.  While emotions ran high, all agreed to meet again July 7.  Separately, the Kirkuk Provincial Council met July 4; they and delayed elections on a deputy governor until July 18 and sharply criticized Iraq's Prime Minister for recent statements on Kirkuk. END SUMMARY.  Kurdish, Turkmen, and Arab Blocs Meet for First Time in Months --------------------------------  2.  (SBU) Kirkuk REO -- together with UK Acting Consul General and U.S. 116BCT team government commander -- initiated the first face-to-face meeting of Turkmen, Arab and Kurdish political leaders since January elections to discuss provincial government on July 3. A second session was held July 4.  Attendees are listed in para 14.  RC told the group that the U.S. seeks consensus in appointments for both cabinet and the constitutional committee.  Excluding core constituencies in this fragile phase of democracy could dampen faith in the process and embolden insurgents.  We expected this effort would pay off soon agreement to include 15 new Sunnis in the constitutional committee in Baghdad.  3.  (SBU) RC said the U.S. had similar hopes for Kirkuk, also a sensitive issue that needed broad consensus to preserve its unique ethnic identity.  RC stressed that this same message had been delivered by Embassy Baghdad to senior Kurdish leaders (ref A). She told the group that if it could arrive at agreements, the U.S. would do what it could to back them up at all levels and with all players who had shown an interest in the future of this province.  Myriad Complaints Lobbed, No One Injured ----------------------------------------  4.  (SBU) All participants thanked the U.S. for bringing them together and agreed that consensus is required to move ahead in Kirkuk.  Mohammad Kamal (KDP) complained that 28 meetings had failed to produce results from Turkmen and Arabs.  Anwar Biraqdar (Turkmen Justice Party) said consensus would not be possible with only one leadership post (deputy governor) being offered to the combined list of Turkmen and Arab blocs.  5.  (SBU) Zhala Younis (Iraqi Turkmen Front) argued that the Kurds had reached agreement last week with the Turkmen but the Kurds had told them they might veto individual nominees.  Several participants complained that the KBL was "vetting" candidates to see if they supported Kirkuk's inclusion into Kurdistan.  Rizgar Ali Hamjan (PUK) told the group that the KBL had not levied this condition, and said press accounts to the contrary (ref B) were false.  6.  (SBU) Ahmed Mohamed Al-Zubaydi (Iraqi National Gathering) questioned the Kurds' interest in consensus, as they now encumbered all key government posts in the province, leaving only five unimportant directorates to the Arabs.  (Comment:  Zubaydi overlooked the Northern Oil Company directorship, which does provide significant employment for Arabs, even if oil revenues do not accrue to provincial coffers.)  Arabs Claim Talabani Reneged on 2004 Agreement to Rotate Governor Job Among Ethnic Groups ---------------------------------------------  7.  (SBU) Ahmed Hameed Al-Ubaydi (Iraqi Republican Gathering, Sunni Arab) and Hussein al-Jabouri (Arab Consultative Council) said Kirkuk should rotate the governorship among its three main communities.  He said the principle was accepted by PUK leader Jalal Talabani in an agreement signed February 2004.  (Note: On July 5, Shwan Qliasani, a former senior official of the PUK, told RC that there was such an agreement; we will try to get a copy.)  Turkmen and Arab Bloc Want Four Key Posts -----------------------------------------  8.  (SBU) The Turkmen and Arabs relayed that they would return to government if given four slots to divide between them:  deputy governor; Kirkuk mayor; reconstruction committee chairman; and appointments committee chair.  Ubaydi pointed out that the provincial council had no right to elect the city mayor (ref B) and said this should provide cover for his removal.  The Turkmen also requested that Kirkuk directorates be distributed fairly among blocs.  Council Chairman Condemns Ja'aferi on Article 58 --------------------------------------------- ---  9.  (SBU) The Provincial Council also met July 4. Kirkuk Brotherhood List (KBL) members voted to delay elections for the deputy governor until July 18. Council Chairman Hamajan alleged that PM Ja'afari had said that the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) will not "approve" Article 58.  He asserted this proved the PM had succumbed to the wishes of foreign powers, and warned against intervention by Turkey and Iran in Iraq's internal affairs. Kamal (KDP) added that any Iraqi leader who does not abide by the TAL should be removed from office.  The Council also discussed committees but deferred substantive action. (Note.  In an interview with the al Sharq al Awsat newpaper on June 28, Prime Minister Jaffari actually said that the TAL had solved the Kirkuk issue, but that "we should give sufficient time and delay action until the question of its mixed population is resolved".  He listed Kirkuk's various ethnic, sectarian and religious groups and noted "even Turkey is worried about the Turkman there, and this means the issue has taken on a regional significance." Ja'fari's comments are in line with Article 58(C) of the TAL which provides that the "permanent resolution of disputed territories, including Kirkuk, shall be deferred until after these measures [i.e. IPCC claims adjudications and recommendations on administrative boundaries] are completed, a fair and transparent census has been conducted and the permanent constitution has been ratified."

Kamal insisted on speaking Kurdish; RC succeeded in keeping with Arabic, the only common language, to save time for Hamajan. The Turkman Younis blamed all failed negotiations on Kamal personally.  The Governor (who as the only Kurd in the July 3 meeting was quite conciliatory), turned to stone in the presence of PUK and KDP representatives on July 4.  11.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002863  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED  TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, IZ, National Assembly SUBJECT: KIRKUK: US, UK ENGAGE KIRKUK ETHNIC GROUPS TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT  Ref:  Baghdad 2746  Baghdad 2860  This is a REO Kirkuk cable.  1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  U.S. Kirkuk Regional Embassy Office Coordinator (RC) and UK Acting Consul General called on Arab, Turkmen, and Kurdish blocs of the Kirkuk Provincial Council July 3 and 4 to urge them to form a consensus government.  The Turkmen and Arab blocs say they will remain engaged in the political process if they obtain four key government posts -- deputy governor, mayor, appointments committee chairman, and reconstruction committee chairman, and have a say in balancing appointments to the director generalships.  While emotions ran high, all agreed to meet again July 7.  Separately, the Kirkuk Provincial Council met July 4; they and delayed elections on a deputy governor until July 18 and sharply criticized Iraq's Prime Minister for recent statements on Kirkuk. END SUMMARY.  Kurdish, Turkmen, and Arab Blocs Meet for First Time in Months --------------------------------  2.  (SBU) Kirkuk REO -- together with UK Acting Consul General and U.S. 116BCT team government commander -- initiated the first face-to-face meeting of Turkmen, Arab and Kurdish political leaders since January elections to discuss provincial government on July 3. A second session was held July 4.  Attendees are listed in para 14.  RC told the group that the U.S. seeks consensus in appointments for both cabinet and the constitutional committee.  Excluding core constituencies in this fragile phase of democracy could dampen faith in the process and embolden insurgents.  We expected this effort would pay off soon agreement to include 15 new Sunnis in the constitutional committee in Baghdad.  3.  (SBU) RC said the U.S. had similar hopes for Kirkuk, also a sensitive issue that needed broad consensus to preserve its unique ethnic identity.  RC stressed that this same message had been delivered by Embassy Baghdad to senior Kurdish leaders (ref A). She told the group that if it could arrive at agreements, the U.S. would do what it could to back them up at all levels and with all players who had shown an interest in the future of this province.  Myriad Complaints Lobbed, No One Injured ----------------------------------------  4.  (SBU) All participants thanked the U.S. for bringing them together and agreed that consensus is required to move ahead in Kirkuk.  Mohammad Kamal (KDP) complained that 28 meetings had failed to produce results from Turkmen and Arabs.  Anwar Biraqdar (Turkmen Justice Party) said consensus would not be possible with only one leadership post (deputy governor) being offered to the combined list of Turkmen and Arab blocs.  5.  (SBU) Zhala Younis (Iraqi Turkmen Front) argued that the Kurds had reached agreement last week with the Turkmen but the Kurds had told them they might veto individual nominees.  Several participants complained that the KBL was "vetting" candidates to see if they supported Kirkuk's inclusion into Kurdistan.  Rizgar Ali Hamjan (PUK) told the group that the KBL had not levied this condition, and said press accounts to the contrary (ref B) were false.  6.  (SBU) Ahmed Mohamed Al-Zubaydi (Iraqi National Gathering) questioned the Kurds' interest in consensus, as they now encumbered all key government posts in the province, leaving only five unimportant directorates to the Arabs.  (Comment:  Zubaydi overlooked the Northern Oil Company directorship, which does provide significant employment for Arabs, even if oil revenues do not accrue to provincial coffers.)  Arabs Claim Talabani Reneged on 2004 Agreement to Rotate Governor Job Among Ethnic Groups ---------------------------------------------  7.  (SBU) Ahmed Hameed Al-Ubaydi (Iraqi Republican Gathering, Sunni Arab) and Hussein al-Jabouri (Arab Consultative Council) said Kirkuk should rotate the governorship among its three main communities.  He said the principle was accepted by PUK leader Jalal Talabani in an agreement signed February 2004.  (Note: On July 5, Shwan Qliasani, a former senior official of the PUK, told RC that there was such an agreement; we will try to get a copy.)  Turkmen and Arab Bloc Want Four Key Posts -----------------------------------------  8.  (SBU) The Turkmen and Arabs relayed that they would return to government if given four slots to divide between them:  deputy governor; Kirkuk mayor; reconstruction committee chairman; and appointments committee chair.  Ubaydi pointed out that the provincial council had no right to elect the city mayor (ref B) and said this should provide cover for his removal.  The Turkmen also requested that Kirkuk directorates be distributed fairly among blocs.  Council Chairman Condemns Ja'aferi on Article 58 --------------------------------------------- ---  9.  (SBU) The Provincial Council also met July 4. Kirkuk Brotherhood List (KBL) members voted to delay elections for the deputy governor until July 18.

BAGHDAD 2694       B. BAGHDAD 2787      C. BAGHDAD 2790 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY.  The ITG is increasingly concerned about attacks to its oil infrastructure. Security has become a priority in recent ITG Cabinet-level meetings.  DPM Chalabi has led extensive ministerial discussions in the National Energy Council, consisting of the Ministers of Oil, Electricity, Water Resources, Industry and Minerals, Finance, Interior, and Defense attempting to find a solution to the infrastructure security problems in Iraq.  Based on our analysis, Iraq has lost over $19 billion in oil export revenues, a significant portion of which is a direct result of insurgent activity from June 2003 through May 2005. Actual export volumes during this two-year period averaged 1.32 million barrels per day; well below our estimate of Iraq's export capacity of 2.4 million barrels per day. The primary causes of this reduction are the insurgency, looting, and an aged infrastructure.  There were over 500 interdictions against oil production and pipeline systems between June 2003 and May 2005. The direct losses to the country are both the foregone export revenues and the cost of repairing the attack damage.  Additional indirect losses include lost productivity, loss of potential gains from capital investments, and foregone infrastructure improvements.  END SUMMARY  --------------------------------------------- ----------- IRAQI GOVERNMENT CONCERNED ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY --------------------------------------------- -----------  2.  (C) Iraq continues to face enormous reconstruction and economic development needs.  At the same time, its main source of revenue -- oil exports, accounting for 95 percent of revenues in the 2005 budget, according to Finance Minister Allawi, are dropping, primarily due to insurgent attacks.  As a result, Iraq will need to address a potentially serious financing gap in 2005 - one that by some estimates could amount to $2-3 billion.  Against this backdrop, DPM Ahmed Chalabi has led extensive ministerial discussions in the National Energy Council (NEC), consisting of the Ministers of Oil (MOO), Electricity, Water Resources, Industry and Minerals, Finance, Interior, and Defense (MOD), in an attempt to find a way to better protect Iraq's oil infrastructure and increase production and exports. (reftels)  3.  (C) The NEC has attempted to find a least-cost solution to providing infrastructure security for the oil pipelines in the north.  They have authorized the establishment, funding, and training of four Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIBS) under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. These units are composed of tribal recruits from the vicinity of the Kirkuk to Bayji corridor.  The ITG has had little success in improving infrastructure protection with these units, and the level of successful interdictions has increased.  This has resulted in much talk in Baghdad between the NEC and the MOD, but no results in the field (REF B).  4.  (C) The DPM and the NEC ministers are frustrated with the MOD, and their inability to use the still few fully mission-capable Iraqi Army units to secure the infrastructure, which are deployed by MNF-I to protect Iraqi population centers from direct attacks by insurgents and terrorists.  The DPM and NEC ministers do not want to use the tribal forces, and do not believe there will be any near-term success using tribal based forces in the form of the MOD plan based on the SIBS.  (REF A, B, C). The DPM has frequently stated the cost for the lack of security in the form of lost export revenue exceeds $500 million per month, and that security could be funded for a fraction of that amount.  The DPM said he would consult with MNFI to request assistance to solve this problem.  The Minister of Oil, in his meeting with the Charge' on July 1, repeated the theme of asking that trained Iraqi Army units currently under MNF-I's control be tasked to guard the northern oil infrastructure with MNFI assistance (septel). The NEC, on July 4, was informed by the MOD of a proposed plan to allocate Iraqi Army forces to assist in providing infrastructure security for the northern pipelines.  This plan is under development at this time and proposes the use of two Iraqi Army battalions under the control of the 4th Iraqi Division in Kirkuk until new units can be formed and trained (septel).   --------------------------------------------- ----- HISTORY OF INSURGENT ATTACKS ON OIL INFRASTRUCTURE --------------------------------------------- -----  5. (C) Iraq's oil production capability in May 2003, at the conclusion of combat operations, was nearly what it was before the war began in March 2003. We did not intentionally target the oil infrastructure during the war, recognizing the importance of its contribution to stability and future reconstruction efforts.  There were a few unintended exceptions including the bridge at Al Fathah, which carried the main northern export pipeline.  We did bomb the bridge, and unfortunately interdicted the entire export capacity of the Kirkuk oil fields, as well as the supply fuel line for the Bayji power plant and refinery.  6. (C) The insurgent interdiction of the oil infrastructure began in earnest in May 2003 with attacks along the strategic pipelines in the south and north.  From the beginning of the war through June 2003, looting of oil field and plant facilities, which has degraded Iraq's oil infrastructure and has contributed to the loss in export revenues, and worker absenteeism, attributed primarily to personal security concerns, disrupted exports particularly in the south.  From June 2003 through May 2005 there were over 500 insurgent-related interdictions of oil infrastructure. Although the average number of monthly attacks declined between January and May 2005, the volume of lost exports increased, which seems to indicate the insurgents have become more effective, getting more 'buck' for their 'bang'.  7. (SBU) Oil production, pipeline, storage, and exporting facilities are anywhere from 25 to 70 years old and deteriorating.  Iraq's oil infrastructure has undergone many years of frugal operating practices and a lack of maintenance.   The dilapidated state of the infrastructure contributes to a lesser, but no less critical, degree to the drop in exports. It is difficult to isolate the effects of deterioration from the effects of insurgency activity. However, it would not be unrealistic to conclude that these systems could have been improved over this same time given a more secure environment.  ---------------------------- VALUE OF IRAQ'S LOST EXPORTS ----------------------------  8. (C) We estimate the direct costs from lost revenue due to oil infrastructure interdiction (including looting, theft, and insurgent attacks) to be $19.1 billion for the two years June 2003 through May 2005.  Lost export revenues are $19.1 billion and repair costs are $64 million.  Of $19.1 billion, only 95 percent would have been available to the government of Iraq because of the requirement to pay 5 percent of revenues to Kuwait as war reparations.  ----------------------- IRAQ'S EXPORT POTENTIAL -----------------------  9. (C) We estimate Iraq's total current potential export volume at 2.4 million barrels of oil per day (mbbl/d); 2.1 mbbl/d from southern exports and 0.3 mbbl/d from the northern route. We define potential exports as the volume of oil that Iraq could export given the following five assumptions: normal wear and tear, unlimited export demand, and an increased domestic consumption of crude oil. We assume that all planned maintenance, capital improvements, and investments were executed.  We also assume that it is appropriate to use actual market prices for the period, concluding that world prices for Basra Light and Kirkuk crude would not be significantly different in either case.  Note that if we arbitrarily reduced Iraq's potential exports by 20 percent, to 1.96 mbbl/d, losses still would have exceeded $15 billion.  10. (SBU) We estimated potential export revenues by multiplying the potential monthly volumes for each type of oil by the monthly average of the daily actual prices of each, adding back marginal production cost, and subtracting the risk discount.   Actual export revenues are estimated in the same manner by multiplying the actual monthly volumes for each type of oil by the monthly average of the daily actual prices of each. Finally, total lost export revenue is calculated by taking the difference between potential and actual export revenues, adding back lifting costs and subtracting the total risk discount. The Iraqi's have been required to offer a risk discount per barrel of oil during the period of insurgency.  Estimates range from between $0.20 and $0.50 per barrel and are attribute to the unreliability of supply.   11. (C) Although they represent a small contribution to direct cost, repair costs are nonetheless relevant to our analysis.  PCO estimates the value of the TD Williamson contract, which supported emergency repair of pipelines, at $59M.  After this contract expired, the Emergency Response Pipeline Repair Operation (ERPRO) paid for repairs, and PCO estimates the total receipts from those repairs are $5M. Thus, the total spent by the USG for repairs is $64M plus any expenses incurred by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for which we do not have an estimate. Significantly, however, only 10 percent of all repairs were paid for by the USG. The Iraqis paid for the rest at a lower cost per repair.  -------------- INDIRECT COSTS --------------  12. (SBU) The indirect costs of terrorist attacks on oil infrastructure may be difficult to identify and even more challenging to value, but they could also be greater in magnitude than the direct components.  If we measured the effect of insurgent interdiction in terms of a loss in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a loss in export revenues, the result would likely exceed our reported estimate because of the effect of a government spending multiplier. Productivity losses accumulate from the interruption of normal business operations and the requirement to divert labor and capital.  There are potentially very larges losses of gains from capital improvements and investment.  Various sources, including the Ministry of Oil, indicated that planned but unrealized investments by domestic and foreign sources would have yielded significant increases in daily production.  Most investors remain reluctant to commit exploration and development funds, in part, because of the lack of security.  ---------------- FUTURE POTENTIAL ----------------  13. (C) The loss of so much revenue is almost impossible to compensate for.   However, we can forecast the volume of exports that might be possible given an end to insurgent attacks and the completion of the Ministry of Oil's plans for infrastructure improvements.  First, we estimate that if the northern strategic pipeline system is secured, then Iraq could immediately increase its exports by 300,000 barrels per day.  In addition, the Minister of Oil estimated that the northern oil field systems could be improved to provide a gradual increase over the next 6 months of an additional 200,000 barrels per day, and that beginning in January 2006 it could do similar infrastructure improvements in the south that would eventually yield an additional 300,000 barrels of oil per day.  This would yield 800,000 bbl/d of increased production available for export. (septel). ------- COMMENT -------  14. (C) COMMENT.  From our study and analysis, the ITG is correct to be so deeply concerned with the lack of security for the key infrastructure of Iraq.  In this brief analysis, we have attempted to quantify the lost revenues resulting from interdictions and the opportunity costs of a failure to adequately protect Iraq's oil infrastructure. The discussions at the NEC (reftels) demonstrate the Iraqi leadership's concern on the lack of infrastructure security and the costs to Iraq. The continued loss of oil revenues threatens the viability of Iraq's reconstruction, recovery and development -- and ultimately, its stability.    END COMMENT  15.

Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In his July 6 meeting with CODEL Levin, President Talabani predicted that the constitution could be completed on time as long as the constitution committee uses the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) as the basis.  He also favored using the same single-district electoral system for the next elections.  Talabani noted detainees in U.S. and Iraqi custody continue to pose problems; he opined that many are innocent and languishing in prison.  Talabani will decline Syria's invitation to visit Damascus unless Syria first takes concrete steps to condemn terrorism, control infiltration, and seize Iraqi Ba'athist's financial assets in Syria.  Talabani underscored the need for a comprehensive agreement to draw down Coalition troops as Iraqi troops stand up.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Constitution Must Be Based on TAL To Make Deadline --------------------------------------------- -----  2.  (C/NF) President Talabani told Levin July 6 the constitution could be completed on time as long as it is based on the Transitional Administrative Law. Although he praised the process as now more inclusive with the additional Sunni members, Talabani feared the Sunnis would push for a greater emphasis on Islam--as the "main source" rather than "a source" of law. Federalism is accepted by all and will likely be applied to other parts of Iraq besides the North, noted Talabani.  He said Ayatollah Ali as-Sistani reportedly prefers a strong, single federal region in the south to guard against Iranian interference.  ---------------------------------------- Prefers Single District Electoral System ----------------------------------------  3.  (C/NF) Talabani said he favored a single district vice multiple district structure for the next elections, thus keeping the system used in the January 2005 elections.  Talabani believed minorities, such as the Yezidis and Christians (and arguably the Kurds, although he did not mention them) would fare better in a national list so they could pool their votes. Talabani also opined that elections are the best way to redress the limited Sunni Arab participation in the process.  Sunni Arab community cleavages make it difficult to discern representative leaders.  The only established representative is the Iraqi Islamic Party, continued Talabani, however not all Sunnis not accept them.  Further, the government's discussions and negotiations with the newly formed National Dialogue Council had raised the ire of many tribal shaykhs and various groups who complained the group does not represent Sunni Arabs.  Sunni Arabs constantly complain about the needs of ex-military officers, observed Talabani.  He added that Sunnis needed jobs programs and other assistance.  ---------------------------------------- Languishing Detainees, Poor Coordination ----------------------------------------  4.  (C/NF) Talabani noted the detainee issue was a frequent problem coming to his attention.  British Parliamentarian and human rights envoy Ann Clywd often sends him letters of the status of various detainees. Talabani complained many detainees are innocent and languishing in prison.  Talabani averred the Minister of Justice is new and learning, but the processes of detainee transfers from the USG to ITG and of trials are slow and require better coordination.  Talabani said he met yesterday with Janabi tribal leaders and subsequently requested the release without trial of the tribal leaders' list of 150 individuals.  To Levin's expression of concern about the issue of a release without proper trial, Talabani replied, "There is nothing against these individuals".  ----------------------------------------- Talabani on Syrian President's Invitation -----------------------------------------  5.  (C/NF) Talabani said Syrian President Bashar invited him to Damascus, a proposal he is considering. He explained that he would not make such a trip unless Syria promised to deliver in three areas.  First, Syria must change the tune of its media to one that condemns terrorism and supports the Iraq's democratic process.  Second, Talabani wants "deeds, not words"; Syria must take concrete steps to control infiltration from along the border.  Third, Syria must cooperate and seize financial assets (e.g., funds in the hands of Baathists) belonging to the Iraqi government that are in Syria.  Talabani mentioned the large amount of Ba'thists working from there.  The Syrians are pledging to take action and issue a joint communiqu7 of cooperation.  (Note:  Talabani's Chief of Staff later told PolCouns that he was dubious Syria's verbal commitment would translate into actions.  End Note.) --------------------------------------------- ---- Need for Comprehensive Plan for Transition to ISF --------------------------------------------- ----  6.  (C/NF) Responding to Levin's question about the presence of Coalition troops, Talabani said that a transition to Iraqi security forces must be done according to Iraqi readiness and not pressure from terrorists.  Talabani admitted to not knowing the status of Iraqi forces or their ability to take over security in cities, but opined it would be better for Coalition troops to leave the cities.  Talabani believed a real status of forces agreement should wait until the next government, but he acknowledged there must be a comprehensive plan to stand up Iraqi troops as Coalition troops stand down.  7.  (C/NF) Talabani preferred the U.S. remain in Iraq to ensure the continuation of the democratic process since many Sunni Arabs are hoping to bring back a dictatorship.  Coalition troops help prevent international interference, he added.  "The neighbors are already interfering; imagine how much worse it would be if you left?"  However, Talabani appealed for Coalition troops to be more careful in dealing with the people.  The President cited the case of a recent prominent individual and friend of Talabani's, who was shot at a Coalition checkpoint, but they had avoided publicizing the incident to avoid embarrassing the Coalition.  8.  (C/NF) Finally, Levin sought Talabani views on capital punishment.  Talabani admitted he was personally opposed to the death penalty--which would almost certainly cause him a problem with the Saddam trial.  Talabani added that he had been a lawyer who had worked extensively with the International Committee for the Red Cross.  9.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a meeting with Charge, Iraqi National Security Advisor Muwafaq al-Rubai expressed optimism that a constitution will be drafted and ratified on time, expressed his opinion that the insurgency will be long and difficult and must be countered with means other than security assets, discussed the difficulties with launching an amnesty program, and urged continued USG pressure to maintain high standards on human rights.  Rubai also addressed the hot button issue of de-Ba'athification.  He believes that for Iraq to defeat the insurgency and to construct a viable democracy with strong, survivable institutions Iraq's leaders must put old divisions aside and promote an "Iraq First" policy, a step that will take much courage. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C)  Charge, accompanied by Political Counselor and Acting PolMil Counselor called on Iraqi National Security Advisor Muwafaq al-Rubai at his office on July 7, 2005. Charge expressed the gratitude of the Mission and MNF-I for the role Rubai has agreed to take in the government.  He emphasized how critical it is for the Mission to have a partner in the government to deal with on political and security issues and expressed confidence that Rubai is the right person for the job.  Charge assured Rubai that he has our full support and told him he should not hesitate to ask us for any support he needs to do his job.  --------------------------- BULLISH ON THE CONSTITUTION ---------------------------  3.  (C)  Rubai thanked the Charge and the President for making the commitment, paid for dearly in blood and treasure, to liberate Iraq and to launch a new trend of democracy in the Middle East.  He acknowledged that the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) has many, many serious problems to face, but expressed confidence that they are on the right track.  He observed that the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) had started with "less than zero", and accomplished a major victory with the elections of January 30.  On that day the people of Iraq said "yes" to the first truly elected government in the history of the country.  Rubai is optimistic about the prospects for the constitution, noting that the Sunnis have now been included in the process and that signs from the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) are also encouraging. He predicts the constitution will be ratified by October and is confident it will be written in a way that will make it impossible for anyone to veto.  When asked whether he believes the Sunni delegates will participate throughout the drafting process, he replied yes.  The Sunnis, he explained, are chastising themselves for not participating in the democratic process during the elections and realize that they have paid a price.  As a result, he strongly believes they will not desert the process again.  -------------------------- THOUGHTS ON THE INSURGENCY --------------------------  4.  (C)  Rubai stated that in his view the insurgency, which he termed "very sophisticated," will now begin to follow Irish Republican Army tactics.  That is, there will be a somewhat acceptable political arm and, at the same time, an active and violent military wing.  In addition, he said that until recently he would have described the insurgency as an "armed Sunni insurgency."  Now he would describe it as "an armed insurgency within the Sunni community." He stated the obvious when he told Charge that for the Sunnis, the insurgency is all about regaining the power they have lost, more so than simply destroying "traitors."   He mentioned that just the prior day, an arson fire had been started on the fifth floor of his government building in the office of the Director General in charge of de-Ba'athification. For generations the accepted paradigm in Iraq has been one in which it was the will of God that the Sunnis should rule.  It was a well-established system where one group dominated the other.  That has been turned on its head.  When the Sunnis lost their power, they lost with it all the privileges that flowed from it.  This turn of events is so unthinkable to them that the idea of ruling through partnerships or consensus is totally foreign.  5. (C) To overcome this obstacle to democracy, it is necessary to change the Sunni mindset by assuring them that their rights will be protected by the constitution.  "If we can in the constitution secure the rights of minorities and give them a veto power over their fates they will participate in the process."  When asked how he thought this could be accomplished he replied that this might be possible by having a second or upper chamber in the legislature that would give minorities enough representation to veto laws that threaten their interests.  In addition, there has to be an answer to the question of what is Iraq.  He mused that the country has lost its identity, which must be redefined.  Before Saddam's fall, Iraq was an Arab state.  Today, there is a place in it for Kurds and others who are not Arabs.  This is an almost impossible concept for some to grasp.  6. (C)  With regard to the future of the insurgency, Rubai believes Iraq must prepare for a long, drawn out fight.  He also acknowledged that it must be fought by education as well as by security means, and derided those in the government afflicted with what he termed "short-termism syndrome."  He said many of his colleagues are kidding themselves because they believe they can solve the problems laid before them in six weeks.  He also believes that to defeat the insurgency, resources must be expended in areas other than in the security field.  Approaching the problem on the single track of "security" is like having tunnel vision.  Rubai also observed that building institutions is just as critical as building a government.  The institutional framework has suffered because everyone is preoccupied by simply getting elected and holding power.  The institutions that are being built today by the ITG must be strong enough to remain in place though changes of government so that they will remain constant, no matter whom the Prime Minister may be.  He lamented that much time has been lost as, to date, almost everyone has tended to focus solely on the security issues. To defeat the insurgency, then, Iraq must have both political and economic development, coupled with politicians brave enough to make tough choices, a commodity in short supply.  -------------------- THE ISSUE OF AMNESTY --------------------  7.  (C)  With regard to amnesty, Rubai acknowledged the ITG is working on a comprehensive plan to address this issue.  In the short term the purpose of amnesty would be for political gain, in the long term for peace.  He is considering an idea whereby detainees would be released immediately in return for a written promise.  This process would be watched and evaluated to see what impact it has on altering the behavior of others.  Rubai explained that one big problem for Iraqis with the idea of amnesty is defining who is being talked about.  For example, in the insurgency the fighters are either Iraqis, Arabs from other countries, or other foreigners.  However, in Iraqi culture it is ingrained in the mind that there is no distinction between an Iraqi and an Arab from elsewhere.  Therefore, to Iraqis, when one says "foreign fighters" Arabs from other nations are not included.  The terms therefore need to be carefully defined, a step, Rubai opined, that will take great courage.  ---------------------------- THE NEED TO SHOWCASE SUCCESS ----------------------------  8.  (C)  Charge advised Rubai that the people of Iraq need to be shown that progress is being made, specifically that the Iraqi security forces are being trained and are gradually taking over from Coalition Forces.  Rubai acknowledged that lack of confidence in Iraqi forces is a real problem that causes insecurity among the public.  He confided that everyone involved with the imminent return of the Convention Center and other portions of the International Zone to the Iraqis and the Red Zone is nervous about this prospect, including the Prime Minister.  The fact remains, however, that there are cities under Iraqi control where relative peace prevails.  And the plan is to stand up more and more Iraqi units in the next year so that Coalition Forces can be pulled out of cities.  Charge emphasized this must be done in a manner that makes it loud and clear to the population that the Iraqi government is successfully taking responsibility for its own people.  -------------------------------- HUMAN RIGHTS, DE-BA'ATHIFICATION --------------------------------  9.  (C)  Charge pointed out that as Iraqi security forces begin to assume more responsibilities on their own, the Sunni population must be assured that they are being protected from the government and the Shias.  Many Sunnis are convinced that purges of their people are taking place in government ministries and steps must be taken to alleviate these fears. In addition, Sunnis feel that the MNF-I and ISF are directing their campaigns at the Sunni community as a whole.  Rubai agreed and urged the USG to continue to emphasize respect for human rights as the Sunnis must gain confidence that the old way of doing things are gone.  The Charge responded that he agrees, but pointed out there is no single contact in the ITG for us to address our human rights concerns.  10. (C)  With regard to de-Ba'athification, the Charge emphasized to Rubai that this program is causing such distrust and anxiety in the Sunni community that it must be moderated.  Rubai responded that the TNA is leading this effort and that feelings are quite strong.  However, he had three major modifications to suggest.  The first is to suggest that de-Ba'athification be pursued by province, and that the three Sunni provinces be exempted.  His second proposal would be to declare the Ba'ath Party a terrorist organization as of a certain date.  Those who remain active members beyond that date will be held accountable for provable individual acts, not mere membership in the organization.  Those who were simply members before the date would not have a problem.  He believes this idea can be sold in the south, but acknowledges that the Kurds would have a difficult time accepting this plan.  His third suggestion is to look at the Ba'ath Party in a different way.  Many of the basic tenants of the party focus on Arab nationalism, which in and of itself may be a legitimate political inclination. Stripping away or declaring illegal ideologies that people have spent most of their lives believing in will only serve to alienate them further.  So what needs to be done is to draw the distinction between acceptable ideologies that were part of the Ba'ath platform and the perverted, extremist version that Saddam perpetuated.  In other words, people should be punished for specific bad acts, not mere membership.  Whether his suggestions are adopted or not, Rubai believes that the message must be unmistakably made that the Ba'ath Party of Saddam Hussein is a thing of the past.  ----------------- LEADERSHIP COUNTS -----------------  11.  (C)  Rubai concluded the meeting by emphasizing that in his view the leadership of the country must be able to clearly enunciate an "Iraq First" message that will reassure all factions that the days where one group dominates another are over.  He acknowledges how difficult this will be and that brave steps will be necessary to transition Iraq into a democratic and peaceful society.  ------- COMMENT -------  12.  (C)  Rubai is an engaging interlocutor who shows the intellectual abilities to think outside the normal Iraqi box.  The question is, can his views be appreciated by his contemporaries in the government and by the public at large? His appeal for brave leadership to advance an "Iraq First" policy may ring hollow among his countrymen who do not have the ability to put historic ethnic and religious strife behind them.  Another possible concern is Rubai's tendency to alienate colleagues and superiors who find his style challenging or overly ambitious.  He fell from grace with IIG Prime Minister Allawi, who found him overreaching.  He plans to attend the Joint Commission on Reconstruction and Economic Development meetings in Amman in the coming days and deliver a speech on economic matters, a subject not necessarily directly related to his portfolio as National Security Advisor, a fact that might raise the eyebrows of his critics.  Nevertheless, Rubai is forward thinking and well placed to move the ITG forward on the security front.  He has developed very good working relationships with Embassy staff and with GEN Casey and the MNF-I leadership. We are hopeful that he will energize the Ministerial Committee on National Security (MCNS) process for which he is responsible and that Prime Minister Ja'afari is capable of delegating the necessary powers to give him a running chance at success.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002878  SIPDIS  KHARTOUM, PLEASE PASS TO D DELEGATION  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2015 TAGS: PREL, ECON, PINS, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab, National Assembly SUBJECT: CHALABI DISCUSSED SUNNI INCLUSION, THE CONSTITUTION, AND ISF WITH CODEL LEVIN  REF: BAGHDAD 2713  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  According to Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, who met with Codel Levin and Charge July 7, attacks on Baghdad's infrastructure have increased.  Chalabi attributes these attacks to better protection of the Kirkuk-Fadha oil pipeline, making it less vulnerable to attack.  Chalabi also blames the insurgents, primarily former Ba'athists, for these attacks, noting that they have access to the security plans developed during the Saddam regime and are using this intelligence to implement the plan in reverse.  Chalabi claims that the insurgents have "better intelligence than we do," pointing out that the intelligence service has no budget and that this issue has not been raised in the Government.  To Chalabi, the fact that the USG entirely funds Iraqi intelligence is problematic.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) During a July 7 meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi told Codel Levin, who was accompanied by Charge, that attacks on Baghdad's infrastructure had increased.  Chalabi speculated the reason is because the oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Fadha is now more protected and less vulnerable to attack.  Chalabi said that insurgents -- primarily former Ba'athists -- are responsible for these attacks, noting that they have access to the security plans developed during the Saddam regime and are using this intelligence to implement the plan in reverse.  Chalabi complained that the insurgents have "better intelligence than we do," pointing out that the intelligence service has no budget and that this issue has not been raised in the Government.  Instead, he asserted, the USG entirely funds Iraqi intelligence, which is causing some problems. (NOTE: Chalabi did not clarify what he meant by problems.  END NOTE.)  3. (C) Chalabi told Levin that the Iraqi military is a "mixed bag," observing that the rate of improvement could be better.  He said the Iraqis are unprepared to take on their own security and that it needs 45 individual battalions before Coalition Forces (CF) could be significantly drawn down. Until then, reasoned Chalabi, CF must partner with Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and endeavor to pull out of urban areas.  Chalabi said a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) is necessary, insisting that the TNA would agree to this.  Such an agreement would make it clear that the U.S. is not an occupier, but an "invitee."  4. (C) Chalabi emphasized that equipping the Iraqi military remains a "sore point" as does the issue of utilizing generals from the former army.  Chalabi insisted that the Iraqi Government should work more with these generals in an advisory -- not command -- capacity, saying that this would be politically feasible.  He also suggested that providing these former officers, as well as other low-level Ba'athists, with a pension would be helpful.  Chalabi estimated approximately 7,000 individuals would be eligible and that the annual cost of such a step would be USD 11 million. Regarding the disbanding of the army after liberation, Chalabi said the barracks had emptied and there was no army to speak of at that time -- many simply left their weapons and walked away.  Chalabi estimated that 90 percent did not want to be there and said nothing would have brought them back.  5. (C) Chalabi pointed out that corruption in the Ministry of Defense (MOD) under the previous Government had done much to undermine the morale of the military.  According to the results of an audit by the Supreme Board of Audits  during the period from January 2004 to February 2005, MOD let 89 contracts worth USD 1.27 billion.  Of those contracts, 43 worth USD 949 million went to one individual -- who was not named in any of them.  USD 759 million was paid in cash for goods and services that have still not been received. Current Minister of Defense Dulaimey estimates corruption during that period to be in excess of USD 600 million.  The good news, said Chalabi, is that many of these former MOD officials are currently under judicial review. (Comment: Chalabi regularly accents the real problems with procurement at the Defense Ministry.  The Supreme Board of Audits recent review and the removal of an official suspected of improper actions are steps forward.  Two officials are being investigated carefully and may well be tried for criminal activities.  Chalabi himself chairs a new committee that reviews contracts above USD 2 million.  Much more remains to be done, and Coalition officials are working with the Defense Minister to improve procurement practices.  End Comment.) 6. (C) Chalabi said that Sunni leaders, such as the National Dialogue's Saleh Mutlak and Abdel Nasser al-Janabi and the Iraqi Islamic Party's Tariq al-Hashemi and Ayed Samarai'e, are a subset of the right people with whom to meet on Sunni issues and suggested that everyone, including the Americans, should meet with them more.  He described the Sunni community as multi-faceted and without clear leadership, saying that Saddam made it impossible for them to betray him and still maintain a power structure.  As a result, the power structure collapsed with Saddam.  7. (C) Chalabi suggested a number of Sunni leaders with whom USG officials should meet, including Sheikh Razi Halish of the B'ai tribe, leaders from Makmudiyah, such as Amar Ali Lehmon of the Sheikhly tribe, and the Ulema Council's Harith al-Dhari.  He described al-Dhari as a significant player -- a person who could make the system either fail or succeed -- and suggested that it is necessary to establish a relationship with him to build rapport.  For increased Sunni participation, said Chalabi, several steps are necessary. First, he said, the Government must disassociate the Sunnis from the Ba'athists.  Doing this would mean making the Sunni community a larger part of the Government and, in particular, the Cabinet.  Secondly, insisted Chalabi, the Sunnis need to be more involved politically in the security problems in their communities.  8. (C) According to Chalabi, part of the problem has been that, previously, the Sunnis had no say in the process of vetting security forces.  Without that commitment, he said, the Government failed.  What the Sunnis do not need, insisted Chalabi, is to feel that outsiders are "beating them up."  As part of the solution, Chalabi noted some government leaders agree on the need for reconciliation committees at the provincial level under the auspices of the Government with which to engage the locals and help maintain security in the 'flash points.'  He argued that overall casualties -- including those taken by CF -- could be reduced if the 'flash points' were taken care of.  9. (C) Chalabi noted the real need to create an integrated military.  It was a mistake, he said, to merge the Iraqi National Guard (ING), given its local orientation, with the army.  Charge pointed out that the logic for doing so was to prevent the ING from morphing into local militias, as well as to balance out the less well-prepared army.  The problem, countered Chalabi, is that now there are Sunnis in Shi'a areas and vice versa.  10. (C) Releasing some detainees, said Chalabi, hiring former generals in an advocacy capacity, and re-establishing the ING would serve to reassure the Sunni leadership to some degree. Additionally, it is important to address the problem of the the roughly 35 mosques, that Saddam built and gave to the Sunnis.  According to Chalabi, the Shi'a took over these mosques after liberation.  Additionally, he noted that the property seizure bill had not been approved, recognizing that the Sunnis would see it as a bad idea.  11. (C) Turning to the issue of detainees, Chalabi said the approximately 13,000 currently in custody are not moving through the process quickly enough and they need either to be charged or released.  Charge explained that MNF has the authority to detain individuals but not to prosecute them. Hence, it is necessary to identify a mechanism by which to transfer detainees to Iraqi custody so the judicial process can begin.  Chalabi suggested that up to 80 percent of the detainees could be released and said a mechanism needs to be developed to talk to detainees to determine whether they are releasable.  (Comment:  Chalabi clearly lacks even minimal familiarity with detainee issues, especially the Combined Review and Release board, which has Coalition representation, but is mostly Iraqi.  We will brief him.  End Comment).  12. (C) There is little chance, said Chalabi, that consensus on a constitution covering all the issues will be reached. He suggested that a partial constitution is likely, but said issues such as Kirkuk, federalism, and the allocation of resources will not be resolved.  However, he opined, success is a function of U.S. pressure.  Nonetheless, he cautioned against haste, saying it would not help the process and emphasizing the need to adhere to the TAL.  Chalabi also advised utilizing the six-month delay provided in the TAL rather than risk having the constitution rejected.  Sunni participation, he said, is critical to this, but pointed out that there are no assurances that the Sunnis on the Constitution Committee can guarantee the Sunni vote.  Key players, he said, such as Nasir Chaderchi and Adnan Pachachi represent an Iraqi political tradition and their participation is necessary -- but they were not selected to be part of the Committee.  (Comment:  Given their miserable vote counts in January 2005, it is not clear that Chaderchi or Pachachi can guarantee much of a Sunni vote either.  End Comment.)  13. (C) The discussion turned to the insurgency and Chalabi insisted that it is primarily comprised of Ba'athists who want to reclaim power.  "Our failure," he said," has been to not separate the Ba'athists from the Sunnis."  Chalabi alleged that the insurgency's funding is coming from Jordan and Syria, and that it still has access to the USD 920 million and EU 90 million that Hussein withdrew from the Central Bank just prior to the fall of his regime.  Chalabi also told Levin that King Abudullah of Jordan should freeze the accounts of those helping the insurgency, adding that he (the King) knows who they are.  (Comment:  We cannot confirm the accuracy of this particular batch of Chalabi accusations.  End Comment.)  14. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, Minimize considered.  Satterfield

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July 10 were Talabani's and Al-Jafari's condolences to the Egyptian President for the assassination of the Ambassador in Baghdad, Al-Jafari's expected visit to Tehran, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "After the killing of the Egyptian ambassador, the 'resistance' leaves the occupiers alone while killing those who opposed the occupation" (Al-Adala, 7/10) B. "Voices of the moon" (Asharq Al-Awsat, 7/10)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ---------------------- A. "After the killing of the Egyptian ambassador, the 'resistance' leaves the occupiers alone while killing those who opposed the occupation" (Al-Adala, 7/10)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI, pro-coalition) published a last-page editorial by Muhammad Al-Abdullah about the killing of the Egyptian ambassador in Iraq:  "The abduction of the Egyptian ambassador, Ihab Al-Sherif, lasted for less than a week before the terrorists decided to murder him. In addition, the terrorists attempted to kill the ambassadors of Bahrain and Pakistan. Before these operations occurred, these same terrorists killed thousands of innocent Iraqis. We have stated previously that the operations of Al-Qaeda, Al-Zarqawi, and Saddam's loyalists represent the most ruthless degree of terror. Despite these groups' claims, these are not 'resistance' operations because these groups do not have an overall strategy for resisting the occupation. Their only apparent objective is to resist the changes that are occurring in the new Iraq.  The men responsible for these terrible crimes are not merely thieves or gangsters. They are terrorists who have increased the severity of their crimes after discovering that the Arab regimes preferred to keep silent rather than openly condemning these crimes. These terrorists regarded the Arab regimes' silence as tacit encouragement to continue conducting their terrorist operations that kill innocent Iraqis. In fact, these terrorist groups have had both direct and indirect relationships with these Arab regimes. However, once these regimes decided to normalize their relationships with Iraq by sending ambassadors or envoys to Baghdad, the terrorist groups realized that Iraq had achieved success. As a result, these terrorist groups will become isolated as they lose the logistical support they were receiving from these Arab regimes. The terrorist groups will be unable to accept this fact because their strategy of provoking sectarian strife will fail.  In response to Egypt sending its ambassador to Iraq, the terrorists killed him. The actions of the terrorists have become unpredictable.  They released the Australian hostage, whose country's troops were occupying Iraq, while killing the Egyptian Ambassador, whose country was opposed to the occupation. Therefore, it is clear that the terrorists' objective is not aimed at resisting the occupation. Rather, their strategy is to resist all Iraqis who are building a new country. The terrorists regarded the presence of an Egyptian ambassador as evidence that Egypt approves of and supports the new Iraqi project. For this reason, the terrorists killed the Egyptian ambassador in order to convey a message of war to Egypt, Bahrain, Pakistan and other countries considering sending ambassadors to Iraq.  Although the terrorists have killed thousands of Iraqis, the Iraqi people are insistent upon making this project succeed. The Iraqi people will crush Al-Zarqawi, Saddam loyalists, and anyone else who wants to damage Iraq. Egypt, Bahrain, and other countries must be courageous and make the right decision in continuing to restore their relationships with Iraq. In the wake of the killing of the Egyptian ambassador, do the Arabs finally realize that what is happening in Iraq is not resistance but terror? These terrorist operations in Iraq are targeting the new democratic project, not the occupation. Can the Arabs see this now or do they need more evidence?"  B. "Voices of the moon" (Asharq Al-Awsat, 7/10) Asharq Al-Awsat (independent, non-biased, London-based) published a last-page editorial by Sameer Attalla about the killing of the Egyptian ambassador in Iraq: "Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi's followers assassinated the Egyptian ambassador in Iraq while their brothers were assassinating bus riders in London. For this reason, the kidnapped diplomat died lonely and without much outrage expressed by the public. One day after the Egyptian ambassador's assassination, he was shown blindfolded in a photo but had not yet been decapitated. Unfortunately, the pan-Arab media outlets decapitated what was left of the story. These networks stated that Al-Zarqawi was not responsible for the crime because Egypt sent an ambassador to Iraq and restored its relationship with a government that was not recognized by Al-Zarqawi. The pan-Arab outlets further stated that the U.S. asked Egypt to send its ambassador to Baghdad.  Providing justification for why this crime was committed is worse than committing the crime itself. We understand that there are no formal international statutes or laws that forbid killers from blowing up buses and trains. There are, however, regulations that protect the lives of diplomats. Indeed, it seems as though Al-Zarqawi is the figure who will decide the future of a country with a population of over 70 million. He will decide which countries Egypt can have relationships with and which countries it should boycott diplomatically.  These pan-Arab media outlets and their hero Al-Zarqawi do not understand that diplomatic relationships can be also formed with countries, not just with the governing regimes. Such relationships are organized by common interests and customs, not by butchers and decapitated heads shown on television. These media outlets must realize that provocation is dangerous because those who provoke such operations might have sons or daughters that climb aboard a bus or join the diplomatic corps. Ambassadors should not be killed because of their government's policies. This deed is worse than the law of the jungle itself. Although we are moving quickly towards the Dark Age, it is too premature for Al-Zarqawi to organize the Arab world's diplomatic representation. It is better for pan-Arab journalists to occupy themselves with praising Al-Zarqawi while allowing Egypt, Bahrain, and other countries to manage their own diplomatic affairs."  SATTERFIELD

BAGHDAD 2120       B. BAGHDAD 2194  Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERT S. FORD. REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY. Senior SCIRI official and Minister of Interior Baqr Jabr lost an opportunity to reach out to the Sunni Arab community by demonstrating that the MOI is serious about protecting human rights during his July 7 press conference.  Jabr said the Ministry's three top priorities are providing security, fighting corruption, and protecting the human rights of Iraqis. However, neither Jabr nor Interior Ministry IG Nori al-Nouri offered specific details of investigations into allegations of abuse or prosecution of perpetrators of such abuse.  Rather, Jabr called reports of torture and abuse in the press 'misrepresentations' and claimed that NGOs and human rights organizations have access to MOI facilities. Sunni Arab reaction to the press conference has ranged from negative to scathing, with a Sunni Endowment member calling Jabr 'a liar.'  To be fair to the Interior Minister, he is working to stop a terror campaign and insurgency that is killing Iraqi civilians daily.  Many Sunni Arabs will condemn terrorism but also believe innocent Sunni Arabs are being targeted unfairly by Jabr's security forces. This belief impedes Sunni Arab leaders from engaging politically with the Shi'a and accepting that political compromises will add to, not diminish, their community's safety.  For Jabr to really make a positive impact on the Sunni Arab community, he must show credible and tangible efforts to stop alleged abuses, not promises.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (U) In a July 7 press conference, senior SCIRI official and Minister of Interior Baqr Jabr outlined the Ministry's three top priorities of providing security, fighting corruption, and protecting the human rights of Iraqis.  Jabr distributed the 'manifesto' he said MOI had disseminated to police, commandos, special forces, and border patrol agents across Iraq.  Even though criminals are killing and perpetrating violence against innocent Iraqis, said Jabr, they must be treated in accordance with human rights standards.  (COMMENT: In the document, Jabr wrote "we will not allow any violations of human rights, torture, or any other form of abuse." Further, the document notes that Jabr himself will conduct spot visits to police facilities and personally follow these issues.  END COMMENT.)  3.  (U) Jabr's press conference focused more on Operation Lightning successes, the reduction of crime in Baghdad, and successes in capturing insurgent elements than on human rights issues.  Jabr did not refer to either specific allegations of abuse or progress in ongoing investigations.  The only specific example of culpability he cited was the recent arrest of the Tikrit police chief for unspecified crimes (these we understand relate to the chief's time as Police Chief in Maysan province during the Saddam regime).  Jabr said that he did not approve of the arrest because the police chief had done a good job. However, as the criminal court had issued an arrest warrant, he had no choice.  4.  (U) MOI Inspector General Nori al-Nouri then provided statistics about corruption and human rights cases, focusing primarily on cases dealing with corruption.  He noted that 323 investigative committees were established in the last two months, resulting in 81 cases.  Of these cases, 36 have been referred to the courts, most of which deal with contracting irregularities, forgery, and fraud.  Nouri referred to human rights cases as the "most important topic" but failed to say anything substantive about any of them.  He merely noted that subcommittees had been formed to assess detainee issues, saying these committees are following through on allegations and concluding "that is all I will say on this."  5.  (U) Several members of the press questioned Jabr about allegations of torture and abuse in MOI detention facilities.  Jabr claimed only one newspaper had printed such allegations and that the reports were a "misrepresentation."  Further, when a reporter complained about the press' lack of access to MOI officials, Jabr countered that operational security concerns often preclude such access.  Additionally, he insisted that non-governmental (NGO) and human rights organizations have access to MOI.  He claimed that representatives of any such organizations should feel free to contact him. (COMMENT: We have heard from numerous sources, including the Ministries of Human Rights and Justice, human rights NGOs, and international human rights organizations, that access continues to be a problem -- particularly in Baghdad and, specifically, within MOI Headquarters.  END COMMENT.)  -------------- SUNNI REACTION --------------  6.  (C) Private Sunni Arab reaction to Jabr's press conference has ranged from negative to scathing.  The National Dialogue's Saleh Mutlek on July 8 told Poloff that he doubted Jabr's veracity, particularly regarding his statements about the misrepresentation of reports of torture and abuse by police.  Likewise, the Sunni Endowment's Naji Ithawi told Poloff July 8 that Jabr is "a liar."  The Sunni community, he complained, does not see Jabr as credible.  "You saw the pictures," stated Ithawi, referring to photographs of dead bodies the Sunni Endowment has provided that clearly show evidence of torture.  "How can he say there is no torture?"  ------- COMMENT -------  7.  (C) This press conference was touted as a forum to discuss human rights, but in fact the Ministry of Interior officials did not go into much detail about their efforts to protect human rights.  Jabr offered little substantive information about human rights abuses by police forces or concrete steps taken to address them.  Contrary to Jabr's claim that reports of abuse and torture are a misrepresentation, there have been numerous, often credible, allegations -- by the media, human rights NGOs, private citizens, prison officials, and witnesses -- that police are perpetrating human rights abuses.  Post has discussed many of these reports with Jabr, who has repeatedly promised to investigate the allegations. Additionally, the perception -- especially within the Sunni Arab community -- is that police forces enjoy impunity when it comes to allegations of abuse against Sunni Arabs (reftels).  Jabr had a prime opportunity to report tangible results showing that, in fact, MOI is committed to protecting the rights of all Iraqis -- regardless of religious or ethnic orientation. Instead, he fell short of the mark, coming across as vague and defensive.  To be fair to the Interior Minister, he is trying to stop a terror campaign and insurgency that is killing Iraqi civilians daily. Many Sunni Arabs will condemn terrorism but also believe innocent Sunni Arabs are being targeted unfairly in the security campaign.  This belief impedes Sunni Arab leaders from engaging politically with the Shi'a and accepting that political compromises will add to, not diminish, their community's safety.  For Jabr to really make a positive impact, especially on the Sunni Arab community, he needs to show that there have been serious investigations of alleged abuses, that these investigations have determined a set of facts and, if the facts so speak, then specific, named officials responsible for abuses have been punished.

(S) SUMMARY: IN A MEETING AT HIS PRIVATE RESIDENCE ON 04 JULY, IRAQI DEPUTY MINISTER OF INTERIOR FOR INTELLIGENCE HUSSEIN ALI KAMAL REPORTED THAT MINISTER OF INTERIOR JABR HAS REPEATEDLY IGNORED ORAL AND WRITTEN REPORTS OF ABUSE AND TORTURE OF DETAINEES CARRIED OUT BY UNITS OF THE SPECIAL POLICE COMMANDOS, INCLUDING THE WOLF BRIGADE.  THIS INACTIVITY CONTRADICTS JABR'S PUBLIC COMMENTS AND PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS WITH USG AND COALITION PERSONNEL. END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- MEETING WITH DEPUTY MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE ---------------------------------------------  2.  (S) BRIGADIER GENERAL EWAN DUNCAN AND IRMO/MOI INTELLIGENCE ADVISOR JEFF MENATH MET WITH DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL AT HIS PRIVATE RESIDENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ZONE AT 2000 HOURS ON 04 JULY.  ALSO PRESENT FROM THE IRAQI SIDE WAS BRIGADIER GENERAL NABIL, COUNSELOR TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER, WHO TRANSLATED.  3.  (S) DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL REPEATED POINTS HE HAD MADE PREVIOUSLY:  THAT THE COMMANDOS AND PUBLIC ORDER BATTALIONS WERE ABUSING PRISIONERS, PRIMARILY SUNNIS, DETAINED IN THE COURSE OF OPERATION LIGHTNING (AN ONGOING MINISTRY OF DEFENSE/MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OPERATION IN AND AROUND BAGHDAD).  KAMAL UNDERSCORED THAT THIS ABUSE WAS BOTH WRONG AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  4.  (S) NOTE:  DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL IS NOMINALLY CHARGED WITH CONDUCTING INTERROGATIONS OF CAPTURED FIGHTERS TO GLEAN INFORMATION USEFUL TO THE COUNTER- INSURGENCY.  HOWEVER, KAMAL CLAIMS THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO MORE THAN TOKEN NUMBERS OF DETAINEES, AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO HIS AUTHORITY HAVE BEEN BEATEN AND HAD NOTHING OF INTELLIGENCE VALUE TO OFFER. END NOTE.  5.  (S) DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL FURTHER SAID THAT HE HAD GIVEN A FILE CONTAINING A WRITTEN LIST OF REPORTED INCIDENTS OF TORTURE BY THE COMMANDOS TO MINISTER JABR OVER TWO WEEKS AGO, ONLY TO HAVE THE LIST RETURNED WITH THE ARABIC WORD FOR "NOTED" WRITTEN ON IT.  KAMAL SAID HE NOW HAS POSESSION OF THIS FILE AND EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO PASS IT TO THE COALITION.  6.  (S) AT AN UPDATE BRIEFING ON OPERATION LIGHTNING ON 05 JULY, MAJOR GENERAL ADNON, COMMANDER OF THE SPECIAL POLICE COMMANDOS AND PUBLIC ORDER BRIGADES, CLAIMED A "CENTRAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE" WAS NEEDED TO HANDLE INTERROGATIONS OF ALL DETAINEES.  OTHERS, INCLUDING MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OFFICIALS, PICKED UP ON THIS CALL IN SCRIPTED FASHION.  ------- COMMENT -------  7.  (S) WE INTERPRET ADNON'S CALL FOR A "CENTRAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE" AS A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO PREEMPT A CONFRONTATION WITH THE COALITION OVER THE CONDUCT OF HIS FORCES AND THEIR HANDLING OF DETAINEES TO DATE.  HOWEVER, POST CONSIDERS IT A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE MUCH NEEDED INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A "CENTRAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE" UNDER THE CONTROL OF DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL COULD FACILITATE MORE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATIONS, GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF OBTAINING ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE, AND PROPER DETAINEE CARE.  8.  (S) ALSO OF NOTE ARE MINISTER JABR'S REMARKS IN A RECENT MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHARGE THAT HE WAS AGAINST ABUSE OF PRISONERS BUT NEEDED PROOF TO ACT.  THIS DOES NOT SQUARE WITH THE ABOVE REMARKS OF DEPUTY MINISTER KAMAL, WHO AS NOTED, PRESENTED JABR WITH A WRITTEN LIST OF ABUSE BY THE COMMANDOS WEEKS AGO.  JABR HAD ALSO CLAIMED TO POLCOUNS ON JUNE 30 THAT THERE HAD BEEN ABUSES AT THE HANDS OF THE COMMANDOS AND THAT FIVE OFFICERS HAD BEEN FIRED AND THREE AWAIT TRIAL.  WE DO NOT YET HAVE CONCRETE DETAILS ON THESE CASES, ALTHOUGH THE MINISTER HAS PROMISED TO PROVIDE THEM. END COMMENT.  9.  (U) REO MOSUL, REO KIRKUK, REO BASRAH, REO HILLAH MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002906  SIPDIS  NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, IZ, Parliament SUBJECT: GARDEN CHATS WITH PAPA JA'FARI AND CREW  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert S. Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY.  Prime Minister Ja'fari unexpectedly sat in on an informal meeting between departing PolOff and one of Ja'fari's aides on July 7. Revealing insights into his own worldview, Ja'fari provided lengthy "love-life" counseling and advice while also sharing details about his own family.  On the constitution, Ja'fari said he preferred a presidential system; he complained that in the current structure there are too many ways to block the executive power's ability to make decisions.  He doubted the constitution committee would accept a presidential system and instead establish a parliamentary system with more checks and balances. He also stated a preference for a Swiss model of federalism.  He commented that Kurds pretend to be victims while acting like victimizers--always asking and pushing for more. The PM's advisors said Ja'fari misses being "social" and prefer not to discuss work over meals or in the evenings.  Ja'fari's advisor complained about the continuing disorganization of the PM's office and the state of the Da'wa party.  They describe a Da'wa party without strong, effective leaders, grassroots support, and funding.  It must reform or be irrelevant, said one advisor who hopes Da'wa will remain on a ticket with SCIRI in the next elections.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (S/NF) Departing PolOff received unexpected counseling and advice from Prime Minister Ibrahim al- Ja'fari who dropped in on PolOff's July 7 late evening meeting with PM advisor Bashar al-Nahar.  PolOff and Nahar were meeting in the PM residence's garden, replete with a new volleyball net (Ja'fari told us he joins in the games; his advisors say he is quite athletic.) and the newly arrived geese in the fetid- looking pond surrounding the house.  PM Ja'fari was still in his suit, but in a relaxed mood.  (We now rarely see the PM without a suit and tie as opposed to his former customary dishdasha.)  --------------------------------------------- ---- "Papa" Ja'fari's Marital Advice:  Look for "Moral Beauty" --------------------------------------------- ----  3.  (S/NF) Knowing PolOff was departing soon, Ja'fari asked her about next steps and then began to dispense marital advice.  Ja'fari delivered a lengthy lecture on the importance of family, which he stressed is the cornerstone of Iraqi society.  Choosing a marital partner is not like choosing a career or moving locations.  It is imperative to choose carefully because making a mistake in one's choice of a marriage partner negatively impacts women more than men. (Note:  Another advisor later told PolOff one of Ja'fari's daughters had been married only a short time and then divorced.  This may explain the importance he placed on wise marital decisions.  End Note.)  4.  (S/NF) Ja'fari emphasized the planning involved in finding the right person with the right values and qualities and urged PolOff to begin this preparation since she was at the age at which she should get married.  He said PolOff was the same age as Ja'fari's eldest son and his daughters who were younger were all married.  Shared values are the most important ingredient, continued Ja'fari.  "Physical beauty will decline but if there is "moral beauty" in the person, then they grow more and more beautiful to you over the years", noted Ja'fari.  Ja'fari said he met his wife while they were in medical school in 1975; they were both 24 years old.  He fell in love with her instantly and they get closer and closer each year, Ja'fari said.  (Note:  One of Ja'fari's advisors said his wife is a very strong woman and very much in charge of the household.  End Note.)  --------------------------------------------- --------- PM Stresses Women's Ability to Choose, Defends Islamic Identity --------------------------------------------- ---------  5.  (S/NF) Ja'fari said the general love and compassion he feels towards people was from his mother, who taught him to love the good in each person no matter how much bad there is.  His mother would always point out the positive elements about each person she met.  PolOff took the opportunity to raise the broader topic of women's issues, including accounts NGOs have brought up of the PM's office seeking to make women under 40 obtain permission of a male relative to travel.  Ja'fari looked slightly pained and said, "Don't believe all of the things you hear.  What you have heard me say to you is what I truly believe and act upon.  For religion and women's issues, there must be choice."  Ja'fari said his three daughters and wife all wear the hijab because they choose to, not because he forces them.  However, Ja'fari also said that it would was important to respect the "Islamic identity" of Iraq and very difficult to remove, for example, the clause in the current TAL that "no law can contradict Islamic principles".  ------------------------ Constitution Preferences ------------------------  6.  (S/NF) On the constitution, Ja'fari said he prefers a presidential rather than parliamentary system because it is more effective.  All the government would be "of the same mind" in a presidential system.  Ja'fari complained that in the current structure there are too many ways to block the executive power's ability to make decisions.  However, Ja'fari said he did not believe the constitutional committee would accept a presidential system because parties will insist on balancing power and on having a greater number of positions for all the various factions in Iraq.  On the topic of federalism, Ja'fari said he prefers the Swiss model of "geographic federalism".  Finally, Ja'fari complained about the Kurds, as victims acting like victimizers--always asking and pushing for more.  ----------------------------- PM's Office Still in Disarray -----------------------------  7.  (S/NF) In a separate conversation with former Chief of Staff Adnan Ali al-Kadhimy July 8, Kadhimy told PolOff he had heard from Ja'fari of his counseling and advice to PolOff and smiled at Ja'fari's nostalgia at playing the fatherly role. Kadhimy then proceeded to tell PolOff "off the record" of the problems in the PM's office and how he had distanced himself from them when he saw that it was clear Ja'fari would fail.  Kadhimy noted he had developed a plan of how to organize the PM's office to be a team--the most important characteristic in his view for the success of the government.  Kadhimy had hired Laith Kubba and Emad Diya, which required convincing a reluctant Ja'fari who did not know them well.  Kadhimy had planned to hire about 15 more advisors as capable as Kubba and Diya.  8.  (S/NF) Kadhimy said he had told Ja'fari the PM's role is strategic and visionary; he should be able to come in to a clean desk in the morning and let his staff handle the details.  Kadhimy said Ja'fari just was not comfortable with that arrangement and takes every decision seriously because he knows it will reflect on him if it fails.  Ja'fari instead surrounded himself with loyal, highly moral people and long-time Da'wa members who have never managed and who know little about organization or generating results. Kadhimy mentioned that July 7 he had been in the PM's office and a senior advisor was signing a stack of files that he could have assigned to an administrative assistant.  PM advisor Nahar separately complained to PolOff July 7 of the hopeless disorganization of the PM office and his desire to get various consulting companies to help them operate better.  Nahar said the British Adam Smith consultants did not provide the practical assistance the office needed.  ------------------------------- Diminishing Power Base of Da'wa -------------------------------  9.  (S/NF) "Da'wa is in trouble", observed Kadhimy, and must reform in order to stay relevant.  The party is becoming out of date with the "old guard" leadership who lacks energy and organization.  The party elders, such as Ja'fari, Ali Adeeb and Jawad al- Maliki are more suited for writing treatises than running a party, he complained.  Da'wa also lacks the grassroots support and the funding of SCIRI.  Kadhimy said he would prefer Da'wa run on a joint ticket with SCIRI in the next elections to not only benefit from SCIRI's ground support but also to dilute the Iranian influence in the government.  Da'wa could keep better tabs on SCIRI's activities and power if it were in a coalition with them.  Kadhimy opined that going it alone would hurt Da'wa such that it could drop to third or fourth of the major parties.  10.  (S/NF) Despite the party's quandaries, Kadhimy said he would never leave Da'wa and knows that because of its long history, many other Iraqis feel the same. Da'wa also has the advantage of a defined ideology and political writings.  SCIRI, on the other hand, could dissolve at any time; there is no one keeping the various entities within the council together.  Kadhimy confided that Vice President 'Adil 'Abd al Mehdi had approached him to join SCIRI but he declined, saying any alliance must await Da'wa party approval and that he would not break with the party. (Comment:  SCIRI bested Da'wa in nearly every provincial council contest in the January 2003 elections.  Kadhimy said he believed 'Abd al Mehdi would be Iraq's next prime minister.  End Comment.)  Kadhimy said he had met with Ali Adeeb and Jawad al-Maliki, who are frustrated with Ja'fari and blame him for many of the problems Da'wa is facing.  However, they both acknowledge their fate is tied to Ja'fari's within the Da'wa party, and they must face the party's predicament together.  11.  (S/NF) Comment:  While Kadhimy was criticizing the disorganization in the PM's office, Ja'fari aide Bachar Nahar was lecturing PolCouns July 9 on Kadhimy's shortcomings and warning that Kadhimy cannot speak for Ja'fari.  Our sense is that the immediate aides around Ja'fari are still jockeying for influence and portfolio assignments are still fuzzy.  The one thing they all agree on is that the PM's office is not well managed.  Meanwhile, Ja'fari's advisors say Ja'fari misses being "social" and do not like to talk business over meals, preferring philosophical topics in general.  Although it is not surprising Ja'fari would dispense such advice given what we know of his genuinely compassionate personality, it is telling that the Prime Minister would take two hours out of his evening for an informal chat with an Embassy Poloff mostly about personal issues.  The organizational problems in his office and the already widespread sense of unease among Da'wa leaders do not bode well for Ja'fari's prospects in the elections or next government.  Moreover, Kadhimy's comments of the problems besetting the Da'wa party itself, such as lack of strong leadership and funding base, echo comments we have heard about its diminishing power base.  12.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July. 11 were calls for the Arab Ministers of Interior to hold a security conference, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Is there any excuse now?" (Al-Bayyan, 7/11) B. "What are the causes and solutions of the attacks in Iraq and Britain?" (Al-Ittihad, 7/11)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Is there any excuse now?" (Al-Bayyan, 7/11)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with Islamic Ad-Dawa party led by Ibrahim Al-Jafari) published a third-page column by Salim Rasool about terrorism in Iraq:  "With the assassination of the Egyptian ambassador to Iraq, the terrorists cannot justify their operations as being part of the "honest resistance" and they can no longer conceal the disgrace of terrorism. Egypt and other Arab countries have now realized that the armed groups in Iraq regard each of these countries as apostates that must be punished according to Islamic law. It is for this reason that the poor Egyptian ambassador was killed. We must ask, however, why did this tragedy occur?  I think that the source of this tragedy originates from the insistence of some groups to forge facts and provoke terror and violence through the media outlets. In addition, Arab governments allowed such coverage to be aired by referring to the presence of freedom of expression. However, these untruthful media outlets began endangering these government's visions, their political futures, and the relationships between one another. Indeed, these media outlets have dealt with the Egyptian ambassador's assassination in a very strange and unrealistic manner. Not only did these outlets justify the killing of the ambassador, they went further by claiming that the Egyptian government is responsible for his killing. These media networks stated that Iraq is under heroic resistance and that Egypt should have never sent an ambassador to Baghdad because the Iraqi government is illegitimate.  The entire world now realizes that what is occurring in Iraq cannot be viewed as resistance. These operations are simply aimed at provoking sectarian sedition in Iraq. However, the Arab street does not want to admit this fact because it is being controlled by media outlets that specialize in hypocrisy and the art of distorting the truth. It is time for the Arab governments to eradicate the terrorist groups and to stop these media outlets from deceiving public opinion. We have stated previously that Al-Zarqawi and his followers do not care about the wellbeing of Arabs. Unfortunately, nobody listened to us. Instead, they chose to believe those who were lying to them. The Arabs went on applauding the beheading of Iraqis under the pretext that all Iraqis were traitors and spies. Therefore, these beheadings were legally justified. We have always felt hurt and betrayed by such Arab attitudes. We would like to know whether the Arabs have an excuse today now that terrorism has begun to target them?"  B. "What are the causes and solutions of the attacks in Iraq and Britain?" (Al-Ittihad, 7/11)  Al-Ittihad (affiliated with the PUK, led by Jalal Talabani) published a third-page editorial by Abdul Hadi Mahdi about the terrorist attacks in Iraq and Britain:  "The entire world has condemned the recent bombings in London. This blanket condemnation derives from a humanitarian perspective because the majority of victims were innocent civilians. At the same time, most countries implemented intensive security precautions around their embassies and other facilities. These precautions are aimed at preventing further attacks from occurring and protecting innocent lives. However, it is interesting to note that these precautions refer to two possibilities. The first is that the security forces lack sufficient intelligence information to stop such operations from occurring. The second possibility is that authorities have received intelligence that indicates there will be similar operations executed in other countries. We do not oppose any country's decision to implement these security precautions because these measures are aimed at protecting lives. The perpetrators of such attacks do not have a specific identity and are not restricted to any particular geographic location. Being diligent is important because if these attacks can be carried out in a country like Britain with a strong intelligence apparatus, then they can certainly be duplicated in other countries with less effective intelligence capabilities. The attacks in London were no easy feat because they coincided with the security precautions implemented for the G-8 summit. Needless to say, the daily attacks in Iraq are more violent than the London bombings and the number of daily victims is much higher.  We must ask why did Iraq's neighboring countries not implement security precautions around their own facilities in Iraq? This answer has several interpretations that require multiple assumptions. Do these countries believe that the terrorist operations occurring in Iraq will never be exported into their lands? Do they prefer to leave the Iraqis alone to face their own destiny? We do not want to search for the answers to these questions. Countries around the world have allocated billions of dollars to counter terrorist operations. However, this amount has proven incapable of putting an end to such operations. Perhaps the billions of dollars that have been spent have only resulted in transferring the execution of these operations from one country to another. Therefore, we must implement an accurate study to discuss the motives behind this dissemination of death culture. We must enact solutions to save the world from this evil. We have grown tired of debates on the pan-Arab satellite channels and newspapers where accusations are exchanged without offering any real or accurate facts."  SATTERFIELD

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In separate meetings with DPM Rosch Shaways and TNA member Qassim Daoud on July 8, the Charge pressed home USG concerns that the constitution might delineate central and regional government revenue and ownership sharing of the nation's natural resources.  Charge explained that depriving the central government of ownership and revenues of the natural resources could jeopardize Iraq's commitments with international financial institutions.  Toeing the Kurdish line, DPM Shaways was unresponsive, while Daoud appeared poised to reconsider his support for joint ownership and revenue sharing.  Shaways and Daoud both fretted that Sunni members would try to sabotage the committee proceedings.  Daoud also sought USG help on checking Kurdish demands on federalism and Kirkuk.   Daoud also predicted the Shia List would not hold for the next elections and that Allawi would get no more than ten seats.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C/NF) Charge d'Affaires Satterfield addressed constitutional issues in meetings with Deputy Prime Minister and KDP member Rosch Shaways and Transitional National Assembly constitution committee member Qassim Daoud July 8.  --------------------------------------------- ------ Warding off Possible Sunni Sabotage of the August 15 Deadline --------------------------------------------- ------  3.  (C/NF) Daoud told the Charge he is less optimistic about meeting the 15 August deadline now with the additional Sunni members on the committee, given their "unreasonable" positions on federalism, Kirkuk, and the identity of Iraq. The committee as a whole has had three meetings and will divide the new Sunni members among the subcommittees on July 9.  Daoud cautioned that the committee must continue working towards the 15 August deadline--"a holy day"-- despite the problems with Sunnis.  He fears some Sunnis will attempt to sabotage the process by withdrawing.  Others, such as Iraqi Islamic Party Ayed Samarai'e and National Dialogue Council's Saleh al-Mutlak, will probably stay, according to Daoud. (Note:  Daoud said he is a long-time friend of Mutlak and can use his personal ties to pressure him on key issues.)  Daoud related how he had highlighted to the Sunnis that there is no steathily prepared draft constitution written by the US, UK, or Israelis, a popular conspiracy theory.  -------------------------------------------- Sunnis Clash on Arab Identity and Federalism --------------------------------------------  4.  (C/NF) Sunni Arabs are insisting Iraq be defined as an Arab nation, which Daoud claims is unfair to the Kurds and other minorities.  Daoud also said the Sunni members are completely unrealistic about federalism and do not at all accept its principles, preferring a strongly centralized system.  (Note: Daoud is a member of the federalism subcommittee.)  Daoud mentioned Ayatollah Sistani's reservations about federalism stem from Sistani's concern that small, autonomous Shia regions will be more susceptible to Iranian interference in the south.  Sistani reportedly would prefer one single southern region in order to forge a stronger area.  Shaways, on the other hand, told the Charge he favors a highly decentralized federal structure, in which the "real power" in the country is at the regional or governorate level.   He warned that the Sunni Arabs already were expressing reservations about federalism and there could be big problems on this point.  Shaways mentioned in passing that the Kurds don't much care if there is a single Shia region within a federal Iraq or several smaller regions. (Comment:  we will check to see if other Kurdish leaders are as nonchalant about this question.  End Comment.)  ------------------------------------ Charge Warns on Regions and Revenues ------------------------------------  5.  (C/NF) Shaways and Daoud separately told the Charge they supported a "shared ownership and revenue arrangement" of natural resources between the central and regional governments.  The Charge made clear that the USG and the international community strongly believe that revenue and ownership of Iraq's natural resources "belong to the Iraqi nation".  Putting a constitutional straight jacket over the ownership of the resources and revenues would complicate Iraq's future relations with the international financial community.  It would be preferable to have revenue-sharing undertaken as part of a normal budget process.  Shaways listened to the Charge's comments but offered no substantive response.  Daoud, for his part, replied, "You have convinced me." and said that he would press the matter with the rest of the committee.  --------------------------------------------- ------- Constitution Committee Leaning Towards Parliamentary System --------------------------------------------- -------  6.  (C/NF) Shaways told the Charge he preferred a parliamentary form of government with the parliament electing the president and prime minister.  He recommended that the Presidency Council remain a three-member group but that it have more authority than the TAL now provides them.  Daoud also said the committee is leaning towards a parliamentary system with a strong prime minister and fewer powers for the president than the current setup.  Daoud believed Iraq's diverse nature requires a diffuse system, because it provides more positions for more factions.  (Comment:  Shaways' preference is logical given the Kurds' minority status.  End Comment.)  --------------- Kirkuk:  Sticky ---------------  7.  (C/NF) Daoud asked the US to help push Kurds to be reasonable about their "place in Iraq", Kirkuk, and federalism.  The Kurds are overstepping their bounds on the KRG's authorities, positions in central government, and geographic area, reaching into traditional Arab regions, such as Ninewa province, he claimed.  Daoud noted that during the week of the Brussels Conference, when much of the Iraqi leadership was out of Baghdad, Iraq had a Kurdish President (Talabani), a Kurdish Prime Minister (acting PM Shaways), Foreign Minister and Kurdish Army chief of Staff.  The Charge responded that we are pressing Kurds on their commitments to Iraq and the process.  8.  (C/NF) Daoud also noted Sistani's view on the Kurds and Kirkuk.  Daoud said Sistani had originally asked Allawi to join the combined Shia list before the last elections so the Shia could present a united front to more effectively limit Kurdish demands.  The Kurds are pressing for Kirkuk's settlement ahead of the constitution and next elections, complained Daoud.  The Charge urged that TAL Article 58 language be the basis for the resolution.  9.  (C)  Shaways separately told the Charge he believed Shia Arabs were not energized about Kirkuk.  He thought they could stay in Kirkuk after the city passes to KRG control if they wanted.  Shaways did not raise the importance of finalizing Kirkuk's status immediately.  Instead, he said the new constitution should contain the Article 58 language verbatim.  Charge pressed Shaways on standing up the Kirkuk provincial government by bringing in genuinely representative Turkman and Arab leaders into the top Kirkuk leadership, along with the Kurdish governor.  It was important, the Charge underlined, to let the Arabs choose their own representative.  Shaways did not argue the point and pledged he would talk to KRG President Masood Barzani.  --------------------------------------------- -------- Daoud on Electoral System and Political Alliances for the Next Elections --------------------------------------------- --------  10.  (C/NF) As he has in previous meetings, Daoud mentioned Sistani's and his own preference for multiple district elections rather than a single district.  Daoud said the IECI was pushing back, complaining there was not enough time. Daoud believed pressure from Sistani might change their tune, however.  Daoud envisioned SCIRI going it alone in the next elections, while Fadhilah, Da'wa-Tanzim, and some Sadrists would form an Islamist bloc.  Da'wa-Ja'fari party could be on its own.  Chalabi would probably align with Sadrists and possibly even the Islamist bloc.  Allawi would be a non-player in the next elections, at most scoring ten seats, opined Daoud.  Allawi was pairing with small figures such as Chederchi and Pachachi.  Daoud claimed Allawi showed his true colors as a man who does not like to lose his grip on power after the last elections and has disappointed the people.   11.  (C/NF) Comment:  On some broad issues, such as Iraq's identity and federalism as a principle, we sense much Kurd-Shia agreement.  That said, it is noteworthy that while Shaways doubted there was much Shia concern about Kirkuk, Qassim Daoud underlined that Kirkuk could be a sticking point.  Other Shia parliamentarians tell us the same thing. Our conclusion is that either the Kurds are tone deaf or the various negotiators have not yet really entered really detailed discussions on Kirkuk and structure of government. We are taking every opportunity to press home the message on revenue and ownership-sharing of natural resources.  Shaways, not surprisingly, offered no comments, given the position directly conflicts with the Kurds' own.  We hope to meet with Masud Barzani directly in the next week to deliver the same message.  Daoud appears to have been convinced and could exert some leverage on members of the committee, but we are raising this issue now with political leaders on all sides. Few seem to have thought much about the different angles of the issue yet, but our position is now understood by many of the constitution drafters. End Comment  12.

Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  The Anbar Provincial Reconstruction and Development Committee (PRDC) holds well-attended, weekly meetings where provincial and city leaders engage in sensible debate over the reconstruction priorities of this area.  It is making steady progress in its efforts to select projects to be funded by Coalition CERP and IRRF dollars.  The panel benefits from the Governor's firm control of the meetings and the seriousness with which most leaders approach the endeavor.  The PRDC has made recommendations that have been approved by the Provincial Council and is eager to begin soliciting bids.  The contracting process for CERP projects will actually take several more weeks, but the Coalition is committed to helping the PRDC meet its deadlines.  If this process goes well, we will look for additional funding for additional PRDC- selected projects in Anbar.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (U) On July 3 the Al Anbar Provincial Reconstruction and Development Committee (PRDC) finished a busy week of planning for the rehabilitation of the province's critical infrastructure.  When the group first met on May 15, they were pleased to learn that the Coalition had set aside USD 15 million worth of CERP funds for projects to be selected by the PRDC, as well as an additional 10 million or more of IRRF funds in the water, road and bridge and electrical transmission and distribution areas.  Hardly sufficient to cover the province's enormous needs, the seed funds are a starting point and the assembled officials are enthusiastic about the initiative.  The meetings are held weekly and chaired by Governor Mamoon Sami Rasheed.  The Deputy Governor, officers of the Provincial Council (PC), Directors General (DG), and city representatives from throughout the province attend regularly.  DGs and council members from the provincial and municipal level immediately began proposing projects for the PRDC's review.  3.  (C) Mamoon is a firm but fair chairman and does his best to keep the members focused on germane topics.  He also insists that DGs and city representatives do their homework before they submit proposals.  He insists that projects be worthwhile and they be appropriate.  When the DG of Municipalities (who is responsible for trash collection) asked for CERP funds to clean the streets, Mamoon rejected the DG's submission.  Mamoon said it was inappropriate for the PRDC to use Coalition funds for work that the DG was supposed to do with his own budget and using his own employees.  When the DG for Roads and Bridges submitted a last minute request, Mamoon chastised him for not coordinating his plans with the DG of Sewers who had insisted that pipes be repaired before the streets are repaved or the roads would have to be torn up again.  4.  (U) After six weeks of deliberations, the PRDC completed its initial list of project recommendations on June 26 and submitted that list to the PC.  The list included projects such as upgrades to electric distribution systems, water purification units, upgrades to telephone exchanges, road and bridge repairs, health clinics and sewers.  Although Ramadi, the provincial capital, would receive more than other cities, the proposed projects are geographically spread throughout the province.  (The PRDC rebutted criticism from Fallujan participants by explaining that Ramadi's population was twice as large and had not had the benefit of the reconstruction funds already allotted to Fallujha.)  On June 29 the PC met and approved all the recommendations from the PRDC.  5.  (C) On July 3 the PRDC met again to iron out some details.  The PRDC had recommended, and the PC had approved, projects totaling approximately USD 13 million.  In an effort to squeeze every penny out of the Coalition's CERP allocation, the panel debated a number of smaller projects and added them to the list. Several members pecked away at their calculators as they approved or rejected the last few projects.  When they finished, there was still a small balance so Mamoon suggested they save it for a project in Al Tash, a refugee camp for Iranian Kurds.  "No one ever does anything for them" he said.  It is not clear if the PRDC will go back to the PC for another vote but the PC Chair sat through the entire meeting and he did not indicate that he thought a new vote was necessary.  6.  (C) Now the PRDC is eager to advertise the projects and elicit sealed, competitive bids.  The envelopes will be opened at a meeting the morning after the deadline and contractors are invited to attend.  The PRDC's enthusiasm is encouraging, but in reality the process will take several more weeks.  The proposals submitted thus far lack the specificity necessary for USG contracting.  However, personnel from the Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers will be working closely with Iraqi engineers over the next few weeks in order to fill in the gaps.  7.  (C) Comment:  The Anbaris are clearly demonstrating a new capacity to manage the affairs of the province.  They simply require money and security. If the PRDC in Anbar makes real progress, we should be able to find additional funding for it.  The capacity of provincial leadership is inextricably linked to their ability to produce results.  As Iraqis learn to flesh out realistic proposals, the USG can coach local officials in the art of public contracting.  Time is short: the first round of contracts must be signed by September 25.  The Anbar Provincial Support Team is determined to expedite the process.  The stated goal is to demonstrate to the people of Al Anbar the connection between their government and the provision of basic public services.  8.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002911  SIPDIS  NOFORN CENTCOM FOR POLAD - AMB HOLZMAN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2025 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, IZ, Terrorism SUBJECT: THE PRESIDENT'S 28 JUNE SPEECH PROVOKES BOTH APPLAUSE AND COMPLAINTS FROM IRAQI POLITICIANS  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  The President's 28 June speech provoked both positive and negative reactions from the Iraqi political class in Baghdad.  We heard appreciation for the President's continuing commitment to fighting terrorism, keeping troops in Iraq, and supporting Iraq's political process.  On the other hand, the President's stated commitment to keeping troops in Iraq gave some politicos an opportunity to tell us they believe the Coalition Forces' continued presence is a problem.  One contact complained the President's message that the US will fight terrorists in Iraq rather than at home left some Iraqis with the sense that Americans did not value Iraqi lives.  The President's support for reconstruction efforts met with universal skepticism.  Indeed, many of our contacts say reconstruction promises jeopardize American credibility because Iraqis continue to "hear talk but see no action".  The President's speech served as a valuable reminder of the USG's need to accurately communicate and convey our goals and actions.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C/NF) PolOff discussed President Bush's speech 29 and 30 June with various Transitional National Assembly (TNA) members.  The members, to whom PolOff distributed a copy of the speech in Arabic, had substantive comments on the range of issues presented in the speech.  The individuals interviewed were TNA constitutional committee member and Sistani representative in Karbala Ahmed al Safi, SCIRI member and constitution committee member Jalaldin al-Saghir, independent Shia Islamist 'Abd al Hadi al-Hakim, and 'Adil Nasir Haji, a Yezidi Kurd from the KDP.  They focused on the messages the President delivered on fighting terrorism, no troop withdrawal, reconstruction, and the political process.  Of note, our contacts also complained the Arabic translation we distributed of the speech provided by Washington was abysmal; the wording did not make sense, was out of order and there were letters missing.  ----------------------------------- Mixed Reviews on Fighting Terrorism -----------------------------------  3.  (C/NF) SCIRI member Jalalaldin al-Saghir applauded the speech's clear message that it would fight terrorists and "would not stop until it finishes them."  Unfortunately, Saghir said the US's commitment to and reasons for fighting terrorism did not get reported to Iraqis in the media in a positive way. PUK's 'Adil Nasr was pleased THE PRESIDENT highlighted the odious actions terrorists undertake, such as killing women and children--a reminder for Muslims to view terrorists in their true extremist light. Likewise, the message that the US would "take the war to the terrorists' house" would cause people to realize destruction will occur in the country in which those terrorists are operating and/or supported.  4.  (C/NF) By contrast, Sistani representative Ahmed al Safi was offended by the statement that the US would fight terrorism outside the US so we would not have to fight it at home, which he said makes Iraqis feel the US only values American life.  Safi also said the President admitted that working in Iraq is difficult and dangerous, which he believes acknowledges the power of the terrorists and will only serve to embolden them.  Safi pointed out that the reason the terrorists failed to provoke a civil war is because the Shia marja'iya and Sunni religious leaders continue to call for calm and self-restraint.  5.  (C/NF) 'Abd al Hadi al-Hakim said the President's message about fighting terrorists rings false since the US is "negotiating with terrorists" and will make Iraqis turn against the political process.  (Note: Hakim is referring to recent press articles alleging US negotiations with insurgents.  End Note.)  --------------------------------------------- Troop Withdrawal Remains a Bone of Contention ---------------------------------------------  6.  (C/NF) Nasir was relieved the President made no mention of a timetable or force withdrawal, which implied the USG's continuing commitment to Iraq.  By contrast, Sunni leaders denounced this aspect of the speech.  Iraqi Islamic Party Secretary general Tarek al-Hashimi and Constitutional Monarchist advisor Faisal Kharagoli told us they were disappointed that once again, the US failed to nod in the slightest to a timetable and claimed the speech gave the impression US troops would be in Iraq for a long time to come. Undersecretary for Bilateral Affairs and SCIRI member Hamid al-Bayati separately told PolOff Bush did the right thing by not saying he was going to send more US troops to Iraq, because such an action would contravene the stated USG commitment to stand up ISF.  ------------------------------------- Reconstruction?  What Reconstruction? ----------------------------------  7.  (C/NF) Al-Safi said the President's pledge to rebuild the country is "a joke for the Iraqis" since they have since no improvements in over two years. Safi commented that, rather than make empty pledges, the US emphasis should be to correct the President and tell him the truth of what is happening on the ground so that when he speaks he does not do such damage to his reputation.  Nasir and al-Hakim had similar reactions.  Nasir noted that there is no ground truth to the reconstruction talk and the slow improvements are trying the Iraqi people's patience as well as the USG's honesty.  Iraqis are fed up with US promises to rebuild Iraq because still they have seen no action to date, said Hakim separately.  Hakim suggested the President should be honest with his promises or should refrain from making them; the "Iraqi people are fed up with talking."  (Comment:  As the Embassy has reported, there is progress on problems like electricity and water.  However, many - if not most - Iraqis expected the U.S. to fix all of Iraq's enormous infrastructure problems and to fix them fast.  End Comment.)  ------------------------------------------ Some Welcome Support for Political Process ------------------------------------------  8.  (C/NF) Some of our contacts appreciated the President's declaration of support for the political process.  However, Nasir wished the President had placed more emphasis on the importance of the constitution and had expressed his support for minority rights and opposition to a religious government--values many Iraqis share.  Sistani's aide Al-Safi, for his part, wanted to clarify to the President that the reason some "Sunnis opposed the January elections" was because they opposed elections taking place under occupation.  Shia cleric As-Saghir did not trust U.S. intentions with the political process.  He said the Shia are enraged with US efforts to include Sunnis; such efforts are getting translated as bringing Ba'thists into positions of influence.  --------------------------------------------- --------- Others Complain Speech Defends Presence of "Occupation Forces" --------------------------------------------- ---------  9.  (C/NF) The TNA members who had only heard excerpts from the speech from the Arab media complained that Bush used his remarks to prolong and defend the presence of US troops in Iraq; they used the opportunity to complain about continued injustices to Iraqi's dignity foreign troops present.  10.  (C/NF) Secular Shia TNA member Ali al-Yousha said that while he appreciated the mission the US originally came here for; he believes the Coalition Forces inflict insults to Iraqis' dignity too great to bear.  Yousha recounted that US troops were welcomed when they first came when they liberated the country. Indeed, he himself guided them through parts of the South and negotiated their safe passage with local leaders.  At the time, the military mingled with the people and were accepted.  However, Yousha complained that the military soon afterward began changing its posture and became more aggressive and insulting.  --------------------------------------------- -------- Speech Discussion is Catalyst to Litany of Complaints about US Military and PSD Behavior --------------------------------------------- --------  11.  (C/NF) Yousha said the issue of the US presence should not be "black and white".  By this he meant that many Iraqis would like Coalition troops to stay as long as they change their posture and tactics. However, if their staying continues to mean daily insults to their dignity then they must leave.  (Note: Yousha described US "insults" as the manner in which the military and private security details harass average Iraqis with their manner of driving, checkpoints, and aggressive weapons posture.  Two other Assembly members joined the conversation, noting that in the past two days; they both had their cars smashed by USG vehicles (it is unclear whether privately-contracted PSD or Coalition military) for failing to move aside quickly enough.  The TNA members complained that the narrow street had rendered it impossible for them to move out of the convoy's way. End Note.)  12.  (C/NF) Al Iraqiya list Christian TNA member Wijdan Salim said she also had heard excerpts of the President' speech, and proceeded to tell PolOff that Iraqis, even educated ones such as herself, find it too difficult to bear seeing foreign troops drive through their streets.  Salim acknowledged Iraq's need for Coalition presence while Iraq builds its nascent security forces, however she hoped the troops could move to bases outside the cities.  ------- Comment -------  13.  (C/NF) Discussing the President's speech with Iraqi politicians provided a unique insight into the situation in Iraq from their ground perspective, such as the realities of the painfully slow pace of reconstruction.  Not surprisingly, the Arab media's focus on the President's lack of withdrawal timeline gave Iraqis an opportunity to reiterate their complaints about Coalition troop presence.  We often hear such complaints, frequently from Assembly members.  However, we find very few Assembly members, even among the loudest complainers, who would go so far as to recommend prompt withdrawal of all Coalition Forces.  We found that those who actually read the speech were much more favorable about the President's remarks than those who depended solely on Arab media reporting.  This is a reminder that we need put out a clear message about Iraq policy regularly for Iraqis.  14.  (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered.   Satterfield

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July 12 were Al-Jafari's upcoming visit to Iran, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "The Prime Minister's new tour" (Ad-Dustoor, 7/12) B. "Blair's call and Talabani's suggestions for ending terrorism" (Al-Adala, 7/12)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "The Prime Minister's new tour" (Ad-Dustoor, 7/12)  Ad-Dustoor (independent) published a front-page editorial by Bassem Al-Sheikh about Al-Jafari's expected visit to Iran and Syria:  "Al-Jafari will soon depart on a new tour to Iran and Syria. It was only recently that the Prime Minister returned from his visit to Brussels, Britain, and the United States. It appears as though our officials will always be destined to travel in order to provide a decent life for the Iraqi people. Al-Jafari's current tour is primarily aimed at solving all pending issues between Iraq and Iran. Most of these lingering issues originated from Saddam's policies against the people of Iran and Iraq. Iran wants to ratify the agreement that was signed in Algeria between the deposed Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein regarding the border issue. This agreement, however, is suspicious because it represents a contract that was signed by two plotters who only cared about their personal interests.  During the last meeting between the Iraqi and Iranian Ministers of Defense, Iran demonstrated its willingness to offer one billion dollars to support Iraq's reconstruction, establish mutual military cooperation, and to help the Iraqi people. However, this assistance had a string attached that stated Iraq must not allow foreign troops to establish military bases on its land. The visit by the Iraqi Minister of Defense was made in preparation for Al- Jafari's visit, which will discuss the above-mentioned issues and focus on obtaining further political support.  I believe Al-Jafari's visit will yield positive results because he has strong relationships with Iranian politicians and leaders. But will his visit settle the issue of the large debts that were accumulated due to the Iraqi-Iranian war that was sparked by the deposed dictator? Will this visit resolve the numerous border issues that have long provided a source for bilateral tension? Will the visit solve the issue of prisoners of war and other missing persons? Will Al-Jafari's visit lead to an agreement regarding the one hundred and eleven Iraqi planes sitting on the tarmac in Iran? We believe that these are the most important issues that should be discussed during the upcoming visit because obtaining political support and cooperation on border security have already been discussed at length."  B. "Blair's call and Talabani's suggestions for ending terrorism" (Al-Adala, 7/12)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a last-page column by Hamdi Hassan about terrorism in Iraq:  "The London bombings will not come to pass without a real strategic review of the international strategy against terrorism. The bombings in London hold the same importance as the September 11th attacks. British Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the motives for terrorism must be eradicated because such terror is aimed at distorting Islam. Blair added that procedures must be implemented to reinforce mutual understandings between the world's religions and to proceed forward in working to achieve peace in the Middle East.  In the wake of the London bombings, this suggestion appears aimed at searching for treatments that can restore the social, economic, and political balance in Middle Eastern countries. Many countries in this region are accused of being a primary source for spawning terrorism. Most importantly, this suggestion is aimed at looking for the motives rather than results. All international efforts must be united, in coordination with the Middle Eastern countries, to root out terrorism. These terrorists are exporting their crimes every day to the Middle East and around the world with the objective of disseminating more horror through killing and bloodshed. In Iraq, however, the situation is more difficult because of the daily presence of terrorist operations. Nonetheless, we think that Blair's suggestions are worthy and we support the call to establish a strategy that will mobilize international efforts to implement practical solutions to end terrorism. Meanwhile, President Jalal Talabani recently called for holding a meeting for all Arab Ministers of Interior to declare their united opposition to terrorism. Such a meeting is especially pertinent since many of these countries are suspected of supporting and financing terrorism. In fact, Iraq's Minister of Defense, Sadoun Al- Dulaimi, revealed that Iraq has evidence that proves certain countries are involved in spreading terror in Iraq. Without a doubt, the most hurtful wounds in Iraq are being inflicted by Arab terrorism. The Arab countries, their media outlets, religious institutions, and social organizations all possess the safety valve that can stop terrorism in Iraq. This fire of terrorism will be extended to burn the Middle East and other countries. For this reason, these countries must respond to the suggestions of Blair and Talabani. A new strategy must be implemented to fight the plague of the current era. Iraq must become the first laboratory where those countries accused of supporting terrorism can prove their innocence. If such countries refuse, we will be forced to reveal secrets for the sake of peace and the protection of nations."  SATTERFIELD 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002922  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, IZ, Elections SUBJECT: ANBARI BUSINESS AND TRIBAL LEADER CHARTS A POLITICAL COURSE  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert S. Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Abdullah Kharbit, a prominent businessman from an influential Anbar tribal family, described the Sunni Arabs as leaderless and unorganized as compared to the Shia and Kurds.  He noted a few leaders have begun creating a Sunni political movement to prepare for the elections in December.  Abdullah said some of these men have received permission from insurgents to enter the political process.  While tribal leaders will command limited support at the polls, the popular new Governor and leader of the Anbar Iraqi Islamic Party will poll well with more educated voters, he opined.  Kharbit emphasized that the real power in the province belongs to insurgents rather than tribes or political leaders.  Abdullah believes some insurgents may help facilitate Sunni political participation, but the extremists will go to great lengths to prevent it. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) On July 7, Ramadi PolOff and 2MarDiv FAO met with Abdullah al-Kharbit, a contractor from a prominent Al-Anbar family who serves as the clan's informal liaison to the Coalition.  Abdullah characterized the Sunnis as leaderless.  The last Sunni leader was Saddam Hussein, and Hussein had effectively eliminated all competition. Abdullah contrasted this with Shia and Kurds, who have established leaders, and a far more organized body politic.  3.  (C) Abdullah identified two main players in the drive to create a Sunni political movement: Khalaf Al-Ayan and Salah Mutlak.  Abdullah claimed that the insurgency has approved these two men's participation in the political process, and they had recently organized a political conference in Ramadi.  Ironically, the conference was cancelled at the last minute when rival insurgents threatened attendees, to which Abdullah attributed to tribal rivalries.  He described the aborted conference as "an Albu Fahad tribal show", given key organizers, Sheikh Nasser and Mohammed Mahmoud Latif, are from the tribe. (Comment: Talal al Gaoud, an Amman-based Sunni political organizer from the Albu Nimr tribe told SET officer in late June in Amman that a more diverse conference was planned for the week of July 11, but it appears to have been cancelled as well.  Mutlak has been an active Sunni negotiator all spring, with multiple and evolving affiliations, most recently as spokesman for the National Dialogue Council.  Khalaf Alayan, also from the National Dialogue Council, is a former senior military officer with alleged strong connections to the insurgency.  End Comment.)  4.  (C) Abdullah claimed his cousin, Hamad al-Kharbit, is influential behind the scenes.  He said Hamad remains well connected to the events of Al-Anbar, although he is based in Amman.  (Note:  In the January elections, Hamad won a seat on the Provincial Council but told SET officer he would not participate.  He said he only registered as a candidate to please the Coalition.  Hamad's slate received a sufficient number of votes for seven or eight seats, but there were only three candidates on his provincial list. End Note.)  Abdullah, meanwhile, was a candidate for the National Assembly, in January, but in the skimpy Anbar voter turnout failed to secure a seat.  Undaunted, he plans to runs again and desires nothing less than a Ministership. He said he considered forming a political alliance with Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Sa'ad Naif al- Hardan, but he now believes Hardan will have too much baggage from his participation in the ITG.  Abdullah also debated an alliance with Minister of Defense Sadoun al- Dulaymi but regards Dulaymi as "too cozy" with Prime Minister Jafari. 5.  (C) In general, Abdullah expects the tribes to do well at the polls.  He observed, the "simple people" will vote along tribal lines.  However, he believes the intelligentsia vote will probably go to the Iraqi Islamic Party.  In fact, Abdullah views Anbar Governor Mamoon Sami Raseed (the local IIP leader) as a rising star.  "He is astonishingly honest and simply unbuyable and believe me, I know."  Mamoon is proving to be a popular and effective manager, said Abdullah.  Mamoon does more work with less money but he still spreads the projects around so everyone feels they are getting something.  "For the next election, bet on Mamoon.  He will be the winning horse."  Abdullah observed Mamoon has survived in Anbar's deadly (literally) politics because he is regarded as an able administrator. Insurgents want water and power, too, Abdullah quipped.  He postulated that the insurgents think the Coalition hates the IIP, so Mamoon automatically gets some street credit. In Abdullah's view, the only other non-tribal Sunni candidates who would do well in an election are Abd Al- Latif Humayem, Mohammed Mahmoud Latif, and Muslim Ulema Council leader Harith Al-Dari.  6.  (C) On security matters, Abdullah believes that the real power in the province rests with the insurgency.  He identified the following people as key insurgent leaders: Mohammad Daham in Ramadi (who is currently in Coalition detention); Sheikh Nou'fel of Khaldiyah; Mohammed Mahmoud Latif who operates in the region between Ramadi and Khaldiyah; Sheikh Saqr of Abu Ghraeb; and Abu Mu'ath (possibly an alias for Izzat Ibrahim Al-Duri) in Al Qaim. Abdullah confessed that the tribes have very little control over these figures.  He also dismissed the notion that the tribes have begun to fight foreign and extremist elements. For example, over the past six weeks there has been sporadic fighting in the town of Al Qaim (near the Iraqi border with Syria) between the Albu Mahal tribe and members of Abu Musab al Zarqawi's Tanzim Qa'idat al Jihad fi Bilad al Rafidayn (QJBR).  However, Abdullah contends this is just the most recent chapter in a traditional tribal feud between Albu Mahal and the Al-Karabouli - many of whom have aligned themselves with QJBR.  (Note: The fighting is likely an effort to control the border and the lucrative smuggling opportunities there.  End Note.)  7.  (C) Although Abdullah downplayed the tribe vs. extremist dynamic, he identified a potential fault line between the local insurgency and the foreign fighters.  In order to prevent a repeat of the dismal voter turn-out in Anbar on January 30, Abdullah believes some insurgent leaders will encourage active participation in the upcoming political process and may participate themselves.  He predicts some insurgent leaders will be divided: some will shelter the political process from the extremists while others will discourage the Sunnis from voting.  He said the insurQnts seek to establish a "legitimate" militia and see themselves performing the role that Pesh Merga and Badr Corps serve in their respective communities.  8.  (C) Abdullah explained that Zarqawi has announced the creation of a new organization called the Omar Corps to counterbalance the alleged persecution of Sunnis by the Badr Corps.  (Note: Omar was the third Islamic Caliph after the death of the Prophet Mohammed and let the great expansion of the Islamic Empire.  End Note.)  Abdullah fears such a move will resonate with all sectors of the Sunni community who fear Shia control of the government and the instruments of state power.  For example, Abdullah says his biggest fear -- as a Sunni -- is the Iraqi Ministry of Interior.  "It might as well be the Iranian MOI," he exclaimed.  He told stories of Sunnis being abused at the hands of MOI personnel.  (Note:  Many Sunni contacts from Anbar now make such allegations.  End Note.)  If the concept of armed revenge finds resonance with the Anbar electorate, Abdullah observed the Sunnis' problems will be compounded.  9.  (C) Comment:  Abdullah is an excellent conversationalist who speaks fluent English and approaches many issues from a Western mind-set which gives him access to many Coalition actors.  His pedigree and his family's connections to the previous regime also give his access to insurgent circles.  However, it is not clear if he has entree to the insurgent inner clique, and he is not above telling fiction if it serves his personal interest. Nevertheless, he is usually pretty good at taking the pulse of the street, he supports the legitimate political process, and his business interests put him on the side of Iraqi stability and progress.  10.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002923  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, IZ, Elections, Electoral Commision SUBJECT: IECI AUGUST VOTER REGISTRATION LIKELY TO BE DELAYED AND UPSET BARZANI  REF: BAGHDAD 2495  Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)  1.  (C) Summary.  Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq Chief Electoral Officer Allami believes the start of the voter registration update period might be delayed until August 7.  IECI is experienced in handling slight delays in schedule, so this one-week delay should not pose a serious threat to the rest of the electoral timeline.  The referendum law is likely to pass shortly; the Transitional National Assembly discussed the two-page draft law prepared by its legal committee on July 11.  The 107,000 people, mostly Kurds, who registered in Kirkuk January 17-25 under an exceptional provision, will have to formally reregister during the August update exercise to participate in the upcoming referendum and December elections.  This requirement will likely irk Barzani. We will work closely with Barzani to win his cooperation so Kirkuk avoids a Kurdish boycott.  End Summary.  Slight Delay Expected ---------------------  2.  (C) Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Allami confirmed to PolOff on July 10 that the IECI might need to postpone the voter registration update period.  In the worst case, he said, IECI would delay the start of the registration period until August 7 and shorten the period from four weeks to three weeks.  He cited delays in signing contracts for printing, logistics support and public outreach/media campaigns as the main reasons for the possible delay.  So far, only the contract for printing of voter lists has been signed.  3.  (C) Security preparations to protect approximately 550 voter registration centers seem to be picking up after a slow start.  At last week's interagency meeting on elections security, a representative from the Ministry of Defense declared that MOD intends to provide specialized training for its troops guarding the centers.  IECI CEO Allami hopes to make significant progress on security coordination during an upcoming July 14 IECI nation-wide meeting that will include participation from 18 IECI governorate directors and their security counterparts.  Like the January elections, Allami said that security conditions in Anbar and Ninewah would determine whether IECI would be able to open registration centers in those provinces.  He said the majority of centers would be in schools and staffed largely by teachers.  (Comment: Not opening the centers in Anbar could discourage Sunni Arab participation in the political process.  And, if centers do not open in Ninewah, the Christian community may accuse the IECI of bias against them.  Reftel describes the voter registration update program in more detail.  End Comment.)  Referendum Law ---------------  4.  (C) The referendum law seems likely to pass shortly; the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) discussed for the first time the draft law prepared by its Legal Committee on July 11.  IECI Commissioner Hamdia (strictly protect) has been unofficially advising the Legal Committee responsible for drafting the law and, she has widely consulted with international electoral experts.  Although unlikely, the current draft may still undergo changes as issues are deliberated.  For example, in a July 10 consultation meeting with the Legal Committee, Hamdia had to explain that the Out-of-Country voting for the referendum is not possible under the TAL.  5.  (C) The two-page draft referendum law under consideration by the TNA formally authorizes the IECI to implement the referendum and certify the results. It clarifies that those having been born on or before 31 December 1987 are eligible to vote.  Additionally, the draft states that the question in the referendum ballot will be "Do agree on the draft of the ballot or not."  The draft law referendum law is brief because it refers to CPA order 92 (Creation of IECI) and Article 11 of the TAL (Iraqi citizenship).  "Reregister" 107,000 Kirkuk Kurds? ----------------------------------  6.  (C) According to IECI Commissioner Safwat (a Kurd), those who were allowed to same-day register and vote on January 30, as well as the 107,000 people, mostly Kurds, who registered in Kirkuk January 17-25 under an exceptional provision, must formally register during the August update exercise to participate in the upcoming referendum and December election.  Safwat said that it was never intended for the exceptional registration cases to be added permanently to the voter roll.  In the case of Kirkuk, Safwat explained that the last-minute solution to avoid a Kirkuk provincial council election boycott by the KDP and PUK leadership led to the agreement that the IECI would accept the 1957 census document as an acceptable identity document for the large number of mostly undocumented Kurds who claimed to be Kirkuk residents. The 1957 census is considered accurate and took place before Saddam Hussein's Arabization program, said Safwat.  7.  (C) However, Safwat continued, 1957 census documents are not widely available and obtaining them is problematic, implying that many of the 107,000 who registered in January unlikely had authentic 1957 census documents.  To avoid a similar situation, Safwat has been advising Kirkuk leaders that authentic identity papers will be strictly required during the upcoming August registration period.  Sawfat said that the Ministry of Interior (MOI) is in possession of 1957 census documents and, to avoid another crisis in Kirkuk, he asked Poloff to quietly press the MOI to make them available to Kirkuk residents.  8.  (C) In a separate meeting, former IFES team leader to the IECI Jarret Blanc agreed with PolOff that the Kurdish registration issue in Kirkuk could potentially be contentious and misunderstood.  He suggested a vigorous IECI public awareness campaign, specially targeting and encouraging the 107,000 Kirkuk residents to reregister in August, was in order.  At the same time, Kurdish leader Masood Barzani should be approached to win his cooperation, opined Blanc.  9.  (C) Comment.  Delays in the return of the Board of Commissioners and key administrative staffers after their meeting with UN/EAD Pirelli in Amman (10 days total outside of Iraq) did not help IECI to meet its recent deadlines.  However, minor delays in the schedule are nothing new for IECI, and this slight postponement should not adversely affect overall electoral preparations.  IECI CEO Allami seems confident that the registration period could be shortened in the event of a delay, but the Board of Commissioners may decide to extend the registration period into September, causing pressures to reduce time periods on other electoral events that follow - including the exhibition and challenges period.  In December 2004, Masood Barzani was dissatisfied with the Kurdish voter registration process and this was one of the factors leading to his threat to withdraw from the Kirkuk local elections.  Looking ahead to the constitution referendum, the "second" registration of 107,000 Kirkuk, mostly Kurdish "residents" will likely upset Barzani.  Barzani could well complain about people having to register again.  We will work closely with him to win his early cooperation so Kirkuk avoids a possible Kurdish boycott of the re-registration process.  End Comment.  10.

(S/NF) Summary:  Iraqi Defense Minister Al-Dulaimi confirmed to Charge on July 10 that he had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Iran during his official visit to Tehran on July 5.  Al-Dulaimi told Charge that his discussions with Iran centered on the need for Iran to monitor its borders with Iraq. It was an initial effort to establish better relations with an important neighbor.  The planning for the trip appears to have been haphazard.  End Summary.  2. (C/NF) Iraqi Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi confirmed to Charge at a dinner hosted by General Casey on July 10 that he had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Iran during his official visit to Tehran on July 5, and provided a copy of the signed document.  The MOU comprises five main points:  -- formation of a joint committee to ensure border security and prevent terrorist infiltration;  -- exchange of information on location of minefields on both sides of the Iran-Iraq border;  -- cooperation in searching for remains of war victims;  -- an Iranian offer to set aside a portion of Iranian reconstruction donations to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense(MOD);  -- and a proposed conference with Iraq's neighbors on regional coordination and cooperation on security and trust-building.  3. (S/NF) Planning for al-Dulaimi's trip appears to have been haphazard and it appears may not have been fully coordinated with PM Jafari, who told Charge he had originally planned to take al-Dulaimi with him to Iran July 16, but al-Dulaimi "had decided to go on his own separately."  Al-Dulaimi changed his mind several times on whether he would take a large group with him to Iran, and eventually decided to bring the Chief of the Armed Forces, the Chiefs of the Army, Air Force, and Navy, a member of the Joint Staff, a bodyguard, a member of the media, and his private secretary.  Even the travel arrangements were uncertain. The Iranians sent a plane to fly the Minister and his party to Tehran, but when it came time for al-Dulaimi to return home he was informed that the plane was no longer available.  He requested that an Iraqi Air Force C-130 be sent to retrieve him, but this was not possible due to the fact that the Iraqi aircraft are still crewed by U.S. military instructor pilots.  As a result, his return home was via Amman and took two days.  4. (C/NF) Al-Dulaimi told Charge that his discussions with the Iranians focused mainly on the need for "practical, non-political" arrangements to control the border and take home small Iraq-Iran War-related CBMs. This is in line with what he told Charge and General Casey on July 2 when he informed them of his intention to visit Tehran (REFTEL). Al-Dulaimi underscored that the MOU's scope was very limited, and asserted that some small steps were necessary to break the ice with Tehran before tackling more difficult issues, including concerns over Iranian interference in Iraqi affairs.  Al-Dulaimi assured Charge, however, that the Iraqis had no intention of allowing Tehran to "train Iraqi forces," as the Iranian MinDef had claimed to the press.  5. (C/NF)Al-Dulaimi recounted to Charge his meetings in Teheran with President Khatami and FM Kharazi, claiming they and others in the current government were "stunned" at the outcome of the presidential elections. The new President, whom al-Dulaimi did not meet, was said by Khatami to "be very tough". Charge cautioned this only underscored our repeated counsel for the ITG to be very careful in how it approached expanded relations with Iran.  6.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY. European Parliament member Baroness Emma Nicholson told Charge on July 9 that the Iraqi Transitional Government must establish a 'coordination commission' in order to receive European Union funding, as well as to provide assurances of accountability.  Nicholson worried that the EU 200 million currently in the budget for Iraq construction would be used for other programs if the funds are not soon obligated, which could also be reflected in the 2006 budget.  Nicholson envisions a EU delegation working with an Iraqi coordination commission to funnel money through either the World Bank or UN directly to the 'spending' ministries.  Expressing concern about this direct funding approach, Charge nonetheless agreed to approach Minister of Planning and Development Barham Salih about the need for such a commission, as well as to suggest that the Iraqi Government develop a prioritized list of feasible projects that the EU could fund. Baroness Nicholson seemed uninformed on recent ITG Progress, woking with BAghdad-based donors including the European Commission/Council rep, developing a new donor coordination mechanism, and fuzzy on the details of even EU assistance procedures. In a meeting  with Saleh at the Brussels Conference she gave him the impression that the EU was about to pledge 130 million euros in "new" money, which, when Saleh's staff pursued it, proved to be inaccurate. We would welcome comment/insights from USEU. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) European Parliament member Baroness Emma Nicholson told Charge on July 9 that the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) must establish a 'coordination commission' in order to receive European Union (EU) funding.  Nicholson emphasized the need to get the Iraqis to a point where they can make coherent presentations on their requirements.  Charge agreed, noting that the ITG has found it difficult to articulate a strategic vision, particularly with respect to taking the difficult steps.  The good and bad news, he continued, is the fact that it is an election year.  Government leaders will need to show progress but, because of potential political ramifications, getting them to make those decisions will be difficult.  3. (C) Nicholson pointed to the lack of a donor coordination mechanism and said Minister of Planning and Development Barham Salih is under the mistaken impression that money is pouring into the 'spending' ministries.  Charge said that Salih had previously not been in a position to coordinate, but this has since been resolved to USG satisfaction. Nicholson countered that neither the ministries nor ministers can effectively coordinate, and hence the need to begin with some kind of a commission structure on which the EU can "hang its hat."  Without that, insisted Nicholson, money will not be forthcoming, even though EU 200 million is currently budgeted for Iraqi reconstruction efforts.  There have been other pledges of assistance, said Nicholson, but realizing those pledges is contingent on spending the money currently allocated for reconstruction.  4. (C) Nicholson referred to the EU/Iraqi "Framework for Engagement" the European Parliament adopted on July 6, which she termed a "warning shot" in the context of the upcoming 2006 budget.  There is money to be spent on Iraq's reconstruction, but she emphasized that the EU will require "absolute assurance" of a coordination mechanism at the national level.  The spending ministries -- which need to convert their wish lists into tangible projects -- should use this mechanism and provide the necessary accountability.  If the money is not obligated soon, worried Nicholson, it could be used for other purposes.  She was supportive of the PRDC concept, but claimed it is at far too detailed a level for EU consideration at this stage.  5. (C) Nicholson anticipated that the EU would send a delegation to Iraq that would want to work with such an Iraqi coordination commission.  Funding, she said, would be funneled through either the World Bank or UN, but the ministries themselves would be able to spend the money. Charge expressed surprise and concern that ministries would have the flexibility to spend the money, pointing out that the U.S. coordinates spending with the ministries, but does not provide them with funding to do with as they please. Nicholson countered that she had lost much support because of "unwelcome" changes in the governments of European states in the course of the last year, so it had taken a great deal of effort to get even to this point.  6. (C) Charge agreed that the USG could press the ITG to engage such a mechanism and would suggest that the Iraqis, specifically Salih, develop a well-scrubbed list of projects, as well as address the EU's concerns about accountability. He noted that Mission personnel are currently in Jordan preparing for the July 18-19 Dead Sea Donors meeting and said he would direct them to coordinate accordingly with Salih.

(C) Nicholson suggested that the most fund-worthy projects are those that can deliver tangible results, including those dealing with justice issues, capacity building, rule-of-law, trade associations and unions, civil society, and police training, as well as traditional 'bricks and mortar' projects such as road building.  Nicholson said other key areas include providing potable water and gender mainstreaming projects that focus on employment training.  However, she voiced concern about the amount of training taking place outside of Iraq, suggesting that future training be conducted in-country to the extent practicable.  8. (C) BIODATA:  Baroness Nicholson was first elected to the European Parliament in June 1999 and re-elected in June 2004.  She is the Vice President of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a member of the Committee for Human Rights.  She was a Member of Parliament for Devon and West Torridge from 1987-1997 and Vice-Chair of the Conservative Party from 1983-1987.  Nicholson is also the founder and Chair of the AMAR International Charitable Foundation, which she founded in 1991 to provide emergency aid for refugees in southern Iraq and the Iraqi marshlands.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a) (b) and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Polish Ambassador to Baghdad Ryszard Krystosik told Charge d'Affaires July 10 that Poland will be phasing down its participation in MNF-I after December.  The decision is not so much because of the expiration of UNSC resolutions as it is because the duration and scope of the deployment is beginning to strain the Polish military, particularly at a time of great change to the military.  In addition, he confirmed that Poland's prime minister plans to visit Iraq later this month, and requested support for the visit.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------------------------- POLES PLAN TO REDUCE PRESENCE IN IRAQ -------------------------------------  2.  (C) Poland's Ambassador to Iraq Ryszard Krystosik, recently returned to Baghdad from a Polish chiefs of Mission conference in Warsaw, called on Charge d'Affaires on July 10 to discuss Poland's continued engagement in Iraq.  He began by saying that Poland intends to change the nature of its military posture in Iraq.  He recounted how Poland has been with the U.S. in Iraq since the beginning and is proud that the situation has been improving gradually in the sector it commands, Multi-National Division - Central-South (MND-CS). However, the Polish government believes it is time to begin to slowly reduce its presence in Iraq.  3.  (C) Ambassador Krystosik hastened to point out that this change does not mean that the Poles will withdraw completely.  Rather, they prefer to see the focus of their mission change.  At first, it was to stabilize the situation.  Now it is shifting more toward an emphasis on training the new Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to do the job themselves.  The Poles would rather concentrate on this training mission, which they believe will mean the commitment of fewer troops.  The Ambassador assured Charge that although the Poles may ultimately be here in smaller numbers than before, their commitment will remain strong and the mission will continue. He estimated that there are 1,700 Polish troops in Iraq and speculated that the number will decrease to 1,500 by September.  A further downsizing is likely to follow.  4.  (C)  Charge asked Ambassador Krystosik if the impending expiration in December of UNSCR 1546 is the reason for this change in approach, and whether the Polish view would be different were the resolution to be extended.  The Ambassador replied that the plan to reduce Poland's presence would be the same.  He explained that Warsaw's decision is not based solely on the status of the mandate, but mainly on the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult for Poland to maintain command of MND-CS.  Some of its troops have served multiple tours of duty and the continued deployment is making it increasingly difficult to maintain the army's equipment. This is happening at a time when the Polish military is undergoing far-reaching and necessary reforms and changes due to its NATO commitments.  Once a military force dependent heavily on conscription, it is now becoming an all-volunteer armed force.  In addition, the Polish military has commitments elsewhere, such as Afghanistan.  Its men and equipment simply cannot stand the strain of continued deployment in Iraq.  5.  (4) Ambassador Krystosik added his own personal view that Poland's continued role in Iraq is likely to be influenced by domestic politics.  He believes that the government in Warsaw may possibly change later in the year, and observed that the opposition parties are dissatisfied with the country's engagement in Iraq.  In short, social ideals in Poland do not support the war.  Nevertheless, said Krystosik, Poland is sending some very good units and an excellent commander this month to relieve the forces that are in Iraq.  And, of course, he could not predict with certainty the outcome of elections.  Krystosik made it clear that Poland's commitment remains strong, even if its future role will focus on training than is now the case.  ------------------------------ VISIT OF POLISH PRIME MINISTER ------------------------------  6.  (C) Ambassador Krystosik confirmed that Polish Prime Minister Belka will lead a high-level delegation to Iraq on July 26 (reftel).  The purpose of the visit is to further develop political and economic relations with Iraq and also to bolster the Iraqi leadership.  Other members of the delegation tentatively include the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Defense, National Economy, Finance, and Culture.  In addition, the government spokesperson, journalists, and a number of businessmen primarily from the power and oil sectors will also accompany the delegation.  The itinerary for the visit matches the one outlined reftel.  7.  (C)  The Prime Minister plans to meet with Iraqi PM Ja'afari and then engage in a plenary session focusing on broader issues to cement the Polish-Iraqi relationship.  The ministers will meet with their counterparts.  The Prime Minister also hopes to meet with the speaker of the Transitional National Assembly, President Talabani, and to hold a joint news conference.  In the afternoon, the delegation plans to fly to Diwaniyah to witness the MND-CS change of command ceremony.  On July 27, they will return to Baghdad, then fly on to Irbil where the PM Belka will meet with President Barzani of the Kurdistan Regional Government. They will then depart Iraq.  8.  (C)  Charge advised Krystosik that PM Belka should press the Iraqi government officials he meets to increase their public outreach activities.  With Barzani, PM Belka should counsel him against taking any provocative steps in Kirkuk. Krystosik confirmed that the accent of the visit will be on affirming Polish support for a unified Iraq and its territorial integrity.  He renewed the request made reftel for logistical support for the visit, and Charge assured him that the U.S. Mission in Iraq will do everything possible to help.  9.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July. 13 were Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick's visit to Baghdad, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "The drafters of the constitution must be noble" (Ad- Dustoor, 7/13) B. "Killing Iraqis is a crime and those who protect the murderers are criminals themselves" (Al-Adala, 7/13)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "The drafters of the constitution must be noble" (Ad- Dustoor, 7/13)  Ad-Dustoor (independent) published a front-page editorial by Bassem Al-Sheikh about drafting the constitution:  "The deadline for completing the draft of the constitution is fast approaching. Unfortunately, there are still disagreements amongst the politicians regarding its content. Some of these politicians are threatening to boycott the constitutional process while others are exerting pressure on the committee to further their own nationalist or political benefits. These benefits, however, will come at the expense of the national public interest. They will also adversely affect the relationship between the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) and the Kurdish Coalition, especially with regard to the Kirkuk issue and applying Paragraph C of the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL).  Now that the fifteen Sunni members have joined the constitutional committee, they will have an effective decision-making role. At the present time, we are in need of noble committee members that will stop any attempt that could destabilize the democratic process in Iraq. However, many Iraqi officials are not paying any attention to the new constitutional members because they believe that these members were not elected. On the other hand, the presence of these Sunni members will put an end to the decision- making monopoly that was formerly enjoyed by the UIA and Kurdish coalition in the constitutional committee.  The participation of the Sunnis demonstrates that all Iraqi sects want to take part in building new institutional and constitutional structures in Iraq. In addition, this participation will put an end to doubts about the legitimacy of the constitutional process. Therefore, the general principles of the constitution must be dealt with in a noble fashion because drafting the constitution is a national goal, not a means to benefit personal interests. This primary goal will lead us on the path to achieve other objectives that will serve to unite all Iraqis as one united country."  B. "Killing Iraqis is a crime and those who protect the murderers are criminals themselves" (Al-Adala, 7/13)  Al-Adala (affiliated with SCIRI) published a last-page column by Muhammad Al-Abdullah about terrorism in Iraq:  "I can understand why Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi conducts all of these criminal operations against the Iraqi people. I can also understand why some Arab countries are encouraging Al- Zarqawi's and Saddam's followers to execute terrorist acts by providing them with shelter, financial support, and facilitating their infiltration into Iraq. I can understand these issues because I know that the terrorists are aiming to destroy the democratic project in Iraq. Today's terrorists were Saddam's former partners in carrying out his crimes against the Iraqi people. Once Saddam the rat was captured and placed into custody, these terrorists continued beheading and killing Iraqis in an attempt to hinder political progress in Iraq.  Anyone who is involved in shedding a drop of Iraqi blood should be regarded as a criminal, regardless of his or her nationalist, sectarian, or religious identity. I am sure that Al-Zarqawi's and some Arab countries' anti-Iraqi attitudes are based on sectarian motives. It was these same motives that were behind the Arabs' silence in response to Saddam's crimes against the Shiites during his regime. However, I cannot understand why some Iraqis, who claim to be patriots, refuse to condemn the actions of Al-Zarqawi, despite the fact that he has publicly announced his campaign to kill Iraqis. This same group of Iraqis refuses to admit that explosions, car bombs, assassinations, kidnappings, and mass killings are acts of terrorism. Instead, they insist to refer to these operations merely as "violence." In addition, these Iraqis shamelessly allege that Iraqi security forces are abusing detainees and employing practices worse than those used during under Saddam's reign. They have also claimed that these security forces are terrorizing the Iraqi people more so than Al- Zarqawi's terror tactics.  The one point that I cannot understand is why these groups are attempting to belittle the Iraqis who have lost loved ones as a result of the terrorist operations executed by Al-Zarqawi's and Saddam's loyalists. Without exception, the men who carry out operations for Al-Zarqawi and Saddam are all terrorists. Iraqis who refuse to condemn terrorism will be regarded as partners to these terrorists, despite their empty calls for slogans of patriotism and nationality."  SATTERFIELD

(C) Embassy and MNF-I representatives held a second meeting with ITG detainee-transition point-of- contact Sharwan al-Waely on July 11, 2005.  As noted in Reftel, Mr. al-Waely was reluctant at our July 5 meeting to concede that security internment played a valuable role in the fight against the insurgency inside Iraq; as a result, we presented a detailed briefing on the demographics and threat profile of Coalition detainees at this second meeting.  2.  (C) Mr. al-Waely was quiet throughout the brief, and showed little interest or confidence in MNF-I's assessment of the current detainee population. He did, however, note that it was the position of the ITG that MNF-I was "releasing detainees too slowly".  Mr. al- Waely did not veto our proposal that we return at the next meeting to the discussion of Iraqi legal authorities for detention, but showed no enthusiasm at the prospect.  -------------------- AVOIDING THE SUBJECT --------------------  3.  (C) Iraqi participation in this second meeting of the joint US-Iraqi working group tasked with determining possible legal authorities for Iraqi security detention upon the expiration of UNSCR 1546 was limited, largely because Mr. al-Waely, who had agreed previously to identify and invite appropriate Iraqi interlocutors, telephoned MNF-I shortly before the meeting to ask that MNF-I do so instead.  4.  (C) Mr. al-Waely arrived an hour-and-a-half late, explaining that he believed the meeting had been scheduled for four o'clock that afternoon.  (The same misunderstanding caused the cancellation of our July 4 meeting, despite the fact that both meetings were arranged and confirmed for nine o'clock in the morning by a native Iraqi linguist.)  5.  (C) Mr. al-Waely suggested that this second meeting be cancelled as well, noting that it was 10:30 and that he had other appointments; however, he agreed to stay for a short briefing by MNF-I Detainee Operations, in which MNF-I presented release statistics, legal procedures, and threat profiles of the Coalition's 10,000-strong, increasingly dangerous detainee population.  ------------------------------------------- COMPLAINTS ABOUT SPEED OF DETAINEE RELEASES -------------------------------------------  6.  (C) At the conclusion of the brief, Mr. al-Waely sighed and said it was the position of the Iraqi government that detainee releases were "too slow".  He did not respond to PolMilOff and MNF-I's review of the expedited release processes for low-threat detainees, nor to the presentation of statistics showing that over 2,500 detainees had been released from local and theater-level facilities in June.  7.  (C) Mr. al-Waely commented he had received "many reports" that "the Americans" were seeding Wahhabi extremists amongst Shi'a detainees in Coalition facilities.  PolMilOff explained MNF-I's practice of identifying and isolating extremist detainees, to which Mr. al-Waely responded "still, there are reports".  PolMilOff asked if Mr. al-Waely could pass us specifics which could be investigated. He shrugged.  8.  (C) Mr. al-Waely appeared to concede in the brief ensuing conversation that some detainees were unsuitable for immediate release, saying he did not object to the detention of individuals "when there is real evidence against them".  However, his demeanor indicated that he gave little credence to MNF-I's assessment that 86% of those detained since January 2005 pose an extreme or high threat to Iraqi security if released today.  9.  (C) Throughout the conversation, Mr. al-Waely demonstrated a striking isolation from other Iraqi governmental bodies. He was unaware that MNF-I presented the Ministry of Justice with monthly detainee rosters, that the Ministry of the Interior was informed of detainee releases, and that Ministry of Human Rights employees were present as advisors inside Coalition detention facilities.  10.  (C) Mr. al-Waely was also dismissive of the security assessments and release-and-retain judgments of the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB), saying "we need a better system".  He did, however, repeat his inquiries as to the names and identities of the CRRB's Iraqi members, for which PolMilOff referred him to the ministries which staff the Board.  ------------- THE WAY AHEAD -------------  11.  (C) While Mr. al-Waely is clearly reluctant to engage seriously on this topic, he remains the Prime Minister's designate.  Moreover, his unwillingness to accept the security implications of the unilateral release of detainees assessed as dangerous by the Iraqi-majority CRRB is not uncommon amongst senior ITG leadership.  12.  (C) We plan to schedule another meeting for July 18, and will again encourage Mr. al-Waely to invite appropriate Iraqi interlocutors.  We intend to return in the next meeting to the subject of current or potential Iraqi legal authorities to hold security internees upon the expiration of Coalition detention authorities, and will report the results.

MNF-I is able to arrange use of indoor facilities at the border, and to transport interviewees round-trip from Camp Ashraf;  (iii) that one or more UNAMI representatives visit Camp Ashraf (MNF-I is able to provide round-trip helicopter transport for a days' visit) to speak with refugee status candidates about UNHCR's willingness to conduct refugee status interviews in future;  (iv) that one or more UNAMI representatives agree to meet with a small representative delegation of refugee status candidates from Camp Ashraf in Baghdad to speak to the same (MNF-I is able to provide round-trip convoy transportation for the Ashraf residents).  ------------------------- ADDITIONAL TALKING POINTS -------------------------  3.  (SBU) MNF-I is aware that refugee status interviews will not provide a quick fix for these 192 Iranian nationals, and rapid third-country resettlement is unlikely. The 192 interviewees, many of whom have awaited refugee status interviews for two years or more, are likewise aware that refugee status determination will not enable their immediate departure from Camp Ashraf.  4.  (SBU) However, there is a growing tension in the TIPF as residents voice their resentment that ICRC- assisted repatriation is successful and ongoing for those willing and able to return to Iran, but that no corresponding arrangement has been made for those fearing for their safety upon repatriation. Several recent unexpected runaways into the desert and isolated occurrences of self-harm attest to the rising stress levels.  5.  (SBU) MNF-I believes that an expression on UNHCR's part of willingness to engage on humanitarian grounds would greatly reduce tension in the TIPF, and have a positive effect on morale. MNF-I would also welcome any additional proposals UNHCR may make with the aim of achieving a similar effect.  --------------------------- QUERY FOR US MISSION GENEVA ---------------------------  6.  (SBU) Many residents of the TIPF have written lengthy accounts of their PoW experiences, kidnapping by the MeK, or persecution inside Iran which they have requested MNF-I pass to UNHCR. If UNHCR does not plan to visit Camp Ashraf or otherwise make contact with MNF-I soon, MNF-I would appreciate guidance on how to handle this correspondence. (TIPF residents have access to APO mail, but are unsure of the correct address for personal letters to UNHCR.) Satterfield

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Summary.  Foreign Minister Zebari told Charge Satterfield on July 11 that Kurdish leaders favor a single national electoral district, but he does not think this position is unmovable.  Charge emphasized that the USG favors an outcome in which natural resources belong to the national government, as outlined in the TAL.  For the USG to spend money on Kirkuk, Charge stressed that the Kirkuk Provincial Council must be seated first.  Coupled with Article 58 discussions within the constitutional debate, Charge outlined three immediate steps: agreement to a seat for an Arab chosen by Arabs, progress on the Iraq Property Claims Commission, and movement on the Kirkuk Foundation.  Zebari urged Charge to meet with Barzani and Talabani on the Kirkuk issue and offered to arrange the meeting.  Charge told Zebari that we would continue to work with the Sunnis and encourage the insurgency to talk to Iraq and the Coalition about laying down their arms.  Following the recent attacks on the diplomatic envoys, Zebari informed Charge that he and Interior Minister Jabr had offered security assistance to foreign missions.  End Summary.  Districts, Resources, and Kirkuk --------------------------------  2. (C) Foreign Minister Zebari told Charge Satterfield on July 11 that he belongs to a small group whose aim is to encourage progress on the constitution.  Drawn from "the two parliamentary groups", this small group includes Vice President Mahdi, Deputy Prime Minister Shaways, Planning Minister Barham Saleh, Deputy Head of the Constitutional Committee Fuad Maasum, and TNA Security and Defense Chairman Maliki.  Zebari said that the group's goal is to facilitate and accelerate discussions on federalism, the status of Kirkuk, the role of religion, the structure of the state, allocation of natural resources, and other contentious issues.  He admitted that no Sunnis belong to this group.  3. (C) Charge asked whether the group had taken any critical positions, pointing out that a "fait accompli" without Sunni participation would not be positive.  After attending only one group meeting since his return from a long trip abroad, Zebari was unsure.  However, he discussed electoral districts, resource sharing, and Kirkuk from a Kurdish perspective.  - ELECTORAL DISTRICTS. Zebari said that Kurdish leadership favors a single national electoral district because Iraq is still in a state of transition.  However, he admitted that he has not spoken to his leadership concerning electorl issue since his return to Baghdad.  Charge suggested that Sistani's preference for electoral districts by provinces had merit. If consensus on the number of seats for each province is reached, Charge explained that proportional representation with provincial districts would encourage Sunnis, promote local representation, and appeal to confessional groups. Zebari opined that the electoral district issue is not an "ideological problem" and would not lead to a "veto" from his leadership.  - RESOURCE SHARING. Charge emphasized that the USG favors an outcome in which natural resources belong to the national government, as the TAL stipulates.  If natural resources are split among regions, Charge warned, it would be difficult for Iraq to conclude economic treaties, and existing IMF agreements would be invalidated.  Zebari replied that there are many modalities to resource sharing, but the key issue is management.  Charge asserted that the key issue for the USG is ownership -- ownership of resources by all of one country.  As an example, Charge said that making clear Kirkuk oil belongs to the nation would help solve the Kirkuk issue.  - KIRKUK. Zebari said that both KDP and PUK will not allow a further postponement to the resolution of this issue.  Charge inquired as to the accuracy of reports that the Government has allocated USD 55 million to Kirkuk.  Zebari was uncertain, but opined that the perception that the Government is moving on this issue is important.  Charge told Zebari that he would travel to Kirkuk and Sulaymania to meet with Barzani to promote the need to work on a process to address the Kirkuk issue.  We have the money to spend on Kirkuk, Charge explained, but the Provincial Council must be seated first.  Coupled with Article 58 discussion within the constitutional debate, Charge stressed that three steps are required to move things forward: seats for Arabs chosen by Arabs - similar to the Turkmen arrangement - and progress on both the Iraq Property Claims Commission and the Kirkuk Foundation.  On the Kirkuk issue, Zebari advised Charge to meet with Barzani and Talabani together, offering to arrange such a meeting.  Yes To Sunni Engagement -----------------------  4. (C) Zebari voiced concern that an all-out outreach to Sunnis could come at the cost of existing alliances.  Charge assured that this is not the case, but stressed that we want the insurgency to end.  He said that the USG will continue to work with the Sunnis on constructive engagement.  If the insurgency wants to talk to Iraq and the Coalition about laying down its arms, Charge said, we will encourage it "with you at the table."  Securing Foreign Missions -------------------------  5. (C) Zebari informed Charge that he and Interior Minister Jabr had met July 11 with chiefs of foreign missions in Iraq and assured them that the Iraqi Government wants to offer security assistance and asked for their cooperation.  He said the meeting was well received.  Unfortunately, Zebari said that the recent killing of the Egyptian Charge and kidnapping attempts on the Bahraini and Pakistani envoys hurt the positive momentum gained during the recent Arab League gathering in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen committed to sending Ambassadors to Iraq.  Zebari agreed with Charge that encouraging missions, especially from Arab countries, to publicly affirm their commitment to Iraq despite recent attacks, would be useful in countering the insurgency.  6.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 002953  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2015 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab SUBJECT: TWO SUNNI ARABS WITHDRAW FROM CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE  Classified By: Charge D' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Poloff confirmed July 14 that two of the fifteen Sunni Arabs recently added to the constitution drafting committee have withdrawn themselves from the process.  One of the men, Dr. Muhammad Mahrus al-Mudaris al-Athami, who is affiliated with the Sunni Conference, had previously complained of health problems and requested that his name be withdrawn from consideration.  The other, Dr. Wisam Sabri al-Ani, affiliated with the National Dialogue Council, had threatened earlier to withdraw because he believed adding specifically "Sunni Arabs" to the committee would only further inflame sectarian tensions.  2. (C) One newspaper report claimed that both men withdrew because they had received threatening letters, but some of their colleagues on the committee told Poloff July 14 that there was more to the story.   Iraqi Islamic Party leader Ayad al-Samarai, also an added member, had reminded Poloff on July 12 of both men's previous complaints and said he believed neither man in the end wanted to put in the work. Shaykh Muhammad Tahir al-Abid Rabbo al-Jaburi, another recent Sunni Arab addition to the committee, downplayed to PolOff the damage caused by the withdrawal and said both men would be quickly replaced.  3. (C) Shaykh al-Jaburi told Poloff that he expected that he and his colleagues would draw from the already-nominated 13 Sunni Arab "expert advisors" in order to find replacement candidates.  He mentioned Dr. Dhamin Hasan Aleiwi, affiliated with the National Dialogue Council, as one previously nominated expert who could simply be promoted to become a member.  Al-Jaburi also said that some of his colleagues were considering nominating Abd al-Nasser Al-Janabi to fill one of the spots.  Janabi is a controversial tribal shaykh affiliated with the National Dialogue Council who claims close ties to the insurgency.  4. (C) COMMENT:  We will watch closely to ensure that the process of replacing these two members does not re-open any of the negotiations we just finally completed.  One of the new members will likely come from the ranks of the "Sunni Conference," a front uniting the Islamic Party and Sunni Waqf, while the other will come from the National Dialogue Council.  Poloff urged al-Jaburi and Samarai to draw from names already on their expert roster rather than seek out new personalities like Shaykh Abd al-Nasser al-Janabi.  The last thing this process needs is for the committee to begin debating personalities again just when it has finally gotten down to its most serious work.  Jaburi said he agreed that quick progress was needed, and we expect to hear of the new nominees in the coming few days.  These two vacancies will be filled, but the threat of future withdrawals over substantive disputes remains and will bear close watching.  5.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (C) At a July 2 meeting with Minister of Interior Baqr Jaber, the Charge raised reports of human rights abuses by the Wolf Brigade.  Jaber agreed on the need to respect human rights, voiced interest in visiting the U.S., and expressed concern about media reports that the U.S. was negotiating with the insurgents.  The MNF-I CG emphasized that media reports notwithstanding, the U.S. is not negotiating with the insurgents.  Jaber suggested that Secretary Rice give a speech clarifying the U.S. role within a sovereign Iraq. END SUMMARY.  ------------------- PRINCIPAL ATTENDEES -------------------  2.  (C) The principal attendees at the July 2 meeting were  -- Minister of Interior Baqr Jaber,  -- Charge d'Affaires David Satterfield,  -- Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) Commanding General George Casey, and  -- IRMO-MOI Senior Advisor James Yellin.  --------------------- TRIP TO UNITED STATES ---------------------  3.  (C) Jaber stated he would like to visit Washington in September to meet with Secretary Rice and Attorney General Gonzalez.  The Charge encouraged the Minister to limit his trip to the United States to a few days so that he spend as little time out of Iraq as possible.  The Charge further recommended the minister travel after the Labor Day holiday.  ------------ HUMAN RIGHTS ------------  4.  (C) The Charge noted reports that Wolf Brigade commandos were acting on behalf of the Badr Corps, and that the commandos had mistreated detainees and used excessive force during arrests.  The Charge emphasized the need for the security forces to respect human rights and conduct themselves in way that is beyond reproach.  5.  (C) Jaber denied the Wolf Brigade was acting on behalf of the Badr Corps.  He agreed on the need to respect human rights.  He added that he welcomed Embassy and Coalition information that would enable the MOI Inspector General to conduct investigations and file charges.  He also said the Wolf Brigade is the most effective of the special police forces.  --------------------------------------------- MEDIA REPORTS OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURGENTS ---------------------------------------------  6.  (C) The MNF-I CG emphasized that media reports notwithstanding, the U.S. is not negotiating with the insurgents.  7.  (C) Jaber said media reports that Secretary Rumsfeld had said the U.S. was negotiating with the insurgents had negatively affected the morale of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and the general public.  Jaber suggested that Secretary Rice give a speech clarifying the U.S. role within a sovereign Iraq.  8.  (C) The MNF-I CG pointed out that Secretary Rumsfeld had not said the U.S. is negotiating with the insurgents.  ----------------- OPERATION AL BARQ -----------------  9.  (C) Jaber also made the following remarks.  -- There is a need to build upon the success of Operation al Barq (a joint counterinsurgency operation in Baghdad conducted by the Iraqi ministries of Defense and Interior in conjunction with MNF-I's execution of Operation Squeeze Play). -- A follow-on joint operation should focus on routes feeding into Baghdad, especially west of Abu Ghraib and east of Mada'in.  11.  (C) Jaber said the success of al-Barq justified a reduction of the curfew from 10:00 p.m.-4:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.-4:00 a.m.  The MNF-I CG expressed his support for a reduction of curfew hours.  ------------------------- OTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS -------------------------  12.  (C) Jaber said the following about other operational matters.  -- Recent attacks by the insurgents reflect a strategic decision by them to place greater emphasis on targeting infrastructure as a way of weakening the government.  -- It would be useful to use tribal forces to help control the borders.  He recently appointed a new Director General of Department of Border Enforcement, Major General Muhsan.  -- Potential areas for future joint operations include Mosul and Taji.  (Jaber accepted an invitation by MNF-I CG to travel to Mosul regarding such operations.)  -- Police training by France would be welcome, provided it be conducted in Iraq.  (Jaber noted that he resented past French support of the Saddam Hussein regime.)  13.  (C) The MNF-I CG emphasized the need for coordination between the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense.  He welcomed the recent formation of a joint planning group to prepare for future operations, such as security for elections.  Jaber agreed on the need for coordination and on the utility of the joint planning group.  ----------------------------- RELATIONS WITH ARAB NEIGHBORS -----------------------------  14.  Jaber said the Syrians claim to be helping on border control, but have not demonstrated that they are doing so. The Charge encouraged Minister Jaber and his colleagues to keep pressure on Syria to work with the Iraqi government.  15.  (C) The Charge also said the Embassy and MNF-I can help to establish a dialogue with the Saudi Interior Minister. Jaber replied that he would welcome such help.  16.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 002959  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2015 TAGS: PREL, PTER, PBTS, PGOV, PINS, MOPS, MARR, IZ, SY, IR, Security SUBJECT: IRAQI MINISTER OF DEFENSE AGREES TO UNDERTAKE OUTREACH TO TRIBES IN RAMADI, BRIEFED ON COMING OPERATIONS  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d)   1. (S)  SUMMARY:  In order to support upcoming military operations in western Iraq, Minister of Defense Dulaymi agreed to help obtain consent and cooperation from local tribes in the region, especially ar-Ramadi. He will prepare a meeting in ar-Ramadi, with MNF-I Commander George Casey accompanying, inviting 40-50 tribal notables to garner their support for the ITG and the coalition.  Dulaymi also recommended trying to work with four specific hard-line rejectionists, who could be very helpful if convinced to support the government's efforts.  The son of one of them, he asserted, headed a group responsible for recent diplomatic kidnappings. He will also help in efforts to obtain support from tribal leaders along the border near al-Qaim in preparation to return the border area to Iraq government control. Casey recommended additional Iraqi measures to secure the border, including urging Syrian cooperation. Dulaymi said Talabani would be traveling to Syria within 10 days at the SARG's invitation.  The ITG is also preparing a way ahead for "rescuing" Tall Afar from terrorists.  As a first step, a delegation including TNA members will travel to Tall Afar to prepare recommendations to the ITG. Regarding Prime Minister Jaafari's upcoming visit to Iran, Min Def asserted that Jaafari intended to spend 7-10 days, including travel around the country. END SUMMARY.  2.  (S)  MNF-I Commander Casey met with MinDef Saadun Dulaymi July 13 to brief the minister on upcoming operations in Western Iraq and to solicit his assistance in engaging key leaders in the province to support the operations. Casey has accompanied by PolMil Counselor Litt, MG Rick Lynch, and IRMO MOD advisor John Noble.  Joining Dulaymi was BG Hatem Majil. Casey reviewed in broad terms the upcoming operations in the northern Tall Afar region, central al-Qaim/al Rawa area, and Ramadi/Fallujah. He stated that our objective is to restore Iraqi control over the border with Syria in those areas by November.  ---------------------- SITUATION IN TALL AFAR ----------------------  3. (S)  With respect to Tall Afar, Casey recalled Prime Minister Jaafari's request to him for a status report on that area, and a determination whether it is necessary to "rescue" Tall Afar. Dulaymi retorted that Jaafari was responding to TNA pressure regarding the situation in Tall Afar, especially from the four TNA representatives from that area. The Min Def stated that Jaafari told the TNA that the ITG would "rescue" Tall Afar within three weeks, and make it a safe place. The government intends to send a delegation including the TNA reps to Tall Afar, and to report practical steps that might be taken to restore order and control by legitimate authorities.  4. (S)  General Casey cautioned that damage in the city could be significant if force is required since the targets - especially foreign terrorists - are hiding in the city. Casey said the delegation's role is important since the ITG should demonstrate that all political means will have been exhausted before resorting to force. Besides, the delegation could be a valuable link to government activities and eventual military operations.  --------------------- AL-QAIM AND AR-RAMADI ---------------------  5. (S)  Regarding the al Qaim region, Casey described the objective of the operation to push westward from al-Rawa and eventually to have Iraqi security forces reoccupy the borders around Qaim.  With the additional construction of fortified outposts, the border in that region could be under Iraqi control by November.  Casey sought the MOD's assistance with local tribal leaders in support of these operations, and provided our assessment of which tribes might be cooperative. Dulaymi agreed to help, and commented that he had just met the shaykh of one of the tribes noted in our assessment, who was committed to supporting the government. The shaykh reportedly gave Dulaymi significant intelligence information, which MOD will convey to us as well.  6. (S)  Casey added that it is essential that the Iraqi government consider other steps to help secure the border, for example, creating a "weapons-free" zone, imposing a strict curfew, and pressing the SARG regarding border security.  Dulaymi noted that Talabani would be traveling to Damascus within 10 days at Asad's invitation, and with the SARG's assertions that it is committed to close cooperation on these issues.  7. (S)  Ramadi, Casey observed, requires a political approach. He mentioned 2 MarDiv Commander MG Huck's discussions with intermediaries in Ramadi that apparently are bearing fruit.  For example, the intermediaries seem to have delivered on their commitments to reduce substantially the emplacement of IEDs in specified areas over a period of a week.  This has led to a second meeting that will take place in a few days. Casey would now like to prepare the next level of engagement by following up on Dulaymi's suggestion to visit Ramadi and meet with leaders.  ------------------ OUTREACH TO TRIBES ------------------  8. (S)  Dulaymi said he would like to travel together with Casey for such an effort. He recommended bringing together some 40-50 tribal leaders, to listen to what they require participate in the political process. If they were to argue for the withdrawal of coalition forces, he said, he would counter that they themselves would then have to assume responsibility to calm the city and have their sons join the government's security forces.  Otherwise, the departure of the coalition would leave a dangerous vacuum.  He observed that some 37 groups operate in Ramadi, most of them criminal organizations flaunting Islamic or political slogans, and all claiming to be leaders.  In fact, he said, none lead more than 5 percent or so of the population - and Zarqawi is trying to move into the real leadership vacuum. Dulaymi said that securing the border around al Qaim would go a long way toward pacifying ar-Ramadi - and vice versa.  Therefore, the al Qaim operations should not be delayed.  9. (S)  Dulaymi also indicated that the following leaders of four of the 37 groups are worth talking to to bring them to collaborate with the Iraqi authorities:  Abd al Latif al Humaym, Mohammad Mahmud Latif al-Fahdawi, Mudhir Abd al Karim al-Kharbit, and Khalaf 'Ulyan. Perhaps by coincidence, 'Ulayan was leaving Dulaymi's office when we arrived. Dulaymi politely introduced us, and after 'Ulayan's departure, Dulaymi explained that 'Ulayan had just informed him that he is ready to help the government - but MinDef did not specify further. Dulaymi said that 'Ulayan's son (possibly Muhammad Khalaf 'Ulyan al Dulaymi) headed a criminal group with alleged involvement in the recent kidnapping of the Egyptian diplomat, and the attempt on the Bahraini. He did not elaborate. Dulaymi also stated that al Humaym and al Kharbit were in Syria, after the Jordanian government asked them to leave Jordan.  10. (S)  Dulaymi cautioned that while the four leaders named above might be very helpful, we should not give them any sense that we recognize them as local political leaders. Casey strongly concurred, and commented that we had had similar offers from Kharbit, but that both Allawi and we doubt his influence and ability to deliver on commitments.  11. (S)  Returning to the proposed meeting with tribal representatives in Ramadi, Dulaymi said we should not try to impose any political leaders on them, but let them identify their own. He suggested two incentives to help such a gathering succeed:  release some of their sons who are in prison (with a guarantor), and open the two bridges whose closing he said has caused significant suffering in the city. The latter, he opined, would do more good than any economic project we could come up with.  These gestures would go a long way toward encouraging the tribal representatives to cooperate. Dulaymi said the MOD would make the preparations necessary for the conclave in Ramadi, including finding a safe location. (COMMENT:  MNF-I will not commit to a meeting before conditions in the city and arrangements for the gathering are secure, and prospects for success reasonably high.  END COMMENT)  12. (S)  Casey concluded the discussion by noting that we will need to protect those who want to promote reconciliation from the terrorists and extremists who are determined to prevent it. To Dulaymi's repeated suggestion that local shaykhs themselves temporarily provide local, tribal security personnel, Casey warned that any protective force must be under the umbrella and control of the ITG, not a separate and independent militia.  ---------------------- MORE ON VISITS TO IRAN ----------------------  13. (S)  Regarding Dulaymi's recent visit to Tehran, he contended, as we have heard before, that his objective was only to deliver a simple message that the two countries must cooperate as neighbors, especially at the border. He demurred when asked whether the Iranians had any particular message for him.  He volunteered that MinDef Shamkhani was "shocked" (he had previously told Charge that other Iranian leaders were similarly astounded) at Ahmedinejad's victory, partly blaming "the West" for having closed the window on the Khatami government's overtures. Shamkhani reportedly stated that Iran could not afford to lose reform as a strategy. Dulaymi also said that in his new capacity as head of a council on Islamic dialogue, Khatami would be traveling to Najaf in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and other Islamic countries.  The MinDef said that interfaith dialogue is a strength that Khatami could bring to Islam.  Finally, Dulaymi asserted that Jaafari intends to spend a week to ten days in Iran, traveling around the country (for example to Isfahan), in addition to meetings in Tehran. (COMMENT: Ten days would be an excessively long time to be away in Iran. Jaafari told Charge July 15 he would travel only to Teheran and that the trip would be brief.  END COMMENT).  Jaafari could ask Dulaymi to join him, but he does not want to go, and hopes the work ahead on the Western operations will convince Jaafari to leave him in Iraq. Satterfield

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July 17 were Al-Jafari's visit to Tehran, the constitutional committee's preparations for drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Waiting for the fruits" (As-Sabah, 7/17) B. "Will the government recognize the resistance?" (Ad- Dustoor, 7/17)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Waiting for the fruits" (As-Sabah, 7/17)  As-Sabah (independent) published a front-page editorial by Jum'a Al-Hilfi about Prime Minister Al-Jafari's visit to Tehran:  "Accompanied by a delegation of ministers, government officials, and journalists, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Jafari has begun his visit to Tehran. This visit is very important as it comes after a period of relative calm between the two countries and coincides with the latest difficulties in the Iraqi situation. Not only is Iraq countering local and foreign terrorism, but it also faces public crises and problems that have persisted for the past two years.  We hope that the discussions in Tehran will focus on mutual cooperation concerning security, water, electricity, and other vital issues. The results of these meetings should be beneficial for both countries. Indeed, we are waiting for these discussions to put an end to the pending issues that have long existed between our two countries. We want to forget the painful past that was caused by Saddam's war.  We want to open a new page of fruitful cooperation that will benefit the interests of both countries. We would like to establish a relationship that is based on mutual respect and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. Al- Jafari's visit is also aimed at confirming the legitimacy and independence of the Iraqi government and to demonstrate its ability to cooperate and deal with its neighbors and other countries in the world. However, we must be careful to steer clear from submissiveness to any country. We wish the Iraqi delegation success and hope that it will achieve fruitful results and have a safe return home."  B. "Will the government recognize the resistance?" (Ad- Dustoor, 7/17)  Ad-Dustoor (independent) published a front-page editorial by Bassem Al-Sheikh about armed groups and their dialogue with the Iraqi government:  "Does the Iraqi government have to recognize the resistance? What would be the real goal behind such a measure? What are the possible benefits from this recognition? Does the U.S. government's secret dialogue with armed groups imply that the Americans recognize the resistance? Will this strategy lead to positive or negative results? Without a doubt, the answers to these questions will have a significant impact on the current political process in Iraq.  Some Iraqis hypothesize that the Iraqi government's recognition of the resistance represents an advancement in the political process. However, such theories must distinguish between the legitimate resistance and those terrorists that are killing innocent civilians under different pretexts. This represents a very important step in making the resistance a part of the Iraqi political entity. Such an accomplishment would be considered a significant and tangible development in the Iraqi situation. In addition, incorporating the resistance into the political process will distinguish those terrorist groups that refuse all forms of dialogue and participation in the new Iraq. Consequently, we will be able to surround and eradicate these groups. Once this occurs, the security situation will be stabilized, the government will not be totalitarian, and basic services will improve.  On the other hand, other Iraqis oppose having a dialogue with the resistance. The views of these individuals contradict with that of the majority of Iraqi society, which accepts dialogue with the resistance as the best solution to end the current crisis. It is up to the Iraqi government to answer these questions in an objective manner. We have heard some officials state that they are ready to cooperate with the devil in order to get rid of terrorism. The Iraqi people formerly accepted this idea of dealing with the devil in order to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Therefore, why do we not have that same level of readiness when it comes to the security and stability of our country?"  SATTERFIELD

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S/NF) Summary:  Prime Minister Jafari told us July 15 that his main message in Iran would be to urge that they tighten controls over the common border while he also warned them away from interference in Iraqi internal affairs.  He said he would also raise bilateral agreements on supply of essential services to Iraq, such as electricity and water, and also raise the return of Iraqi aircraft impounded in Iran.  Jafari welcomed word of better coordination on intelligence issues with the Coalition, but he cautioned that he would be the ultimate decision-maker on the Iraqi side. He indicated he might let Iraqi National Intelligence director Shahwani go for political expediency.  Jafari also pledged to work more closely with us to prepare the transfer of detainees from Coalition control to Iraqi control and named a lead on the Iraqi side.

(S/NF) Prime Minister Jafari told Charge and MNF-I CG Casey over dinner July 14 that he would take a large delegation to Iran for a three-day visit starting July 15. The most important issue he would raise, he said, would be the need for Iran to control its border more tightly.  Unlike Syria, he didn't think that the Iranians were intentionally facilitating anti-Iraqi forces' entry into Iraq.  They had to do more however.  Casey and the Charge cautioned that the Iranian Government might be consciously helping AIF elements in Iraq, and they promised more detailed information before the PM's departure.  (MNF-I did deliver the information before the Prime Minister departure.)  Jafari stressed that there are two "red-lines" that he will highlight to the authorities in Tehran.  First, they must control the borders and stop infiltration.  In addition, they must not try to interfere in Iraqi internal politics.  The Prime Minister observed that he would have to deliver this message across a range of the Iranian leadership to be sure that everyone in what he called a divided Iranian government understands.  3.  (C) Jafari added that he would take a long list of Iraqi requests, including agreements on essential services such as electricity and water.  Jafari said he would also seek the return of Iraqi military and civilian aircraft that have long been held in Iran.  (Jafari also mentioned in passing that the two sides would discuss an oil agreement.)  The Prime Minister doubted he would get everything on his list, but raising the issues might start the Iranians working on positive responses later.  Charge told the Prime Minister that we understand Iraq's need to have good relations with its neighbors, but urged him to be careful to secure agreements with the Iranians that were clearly in Iraq's interest - not just Iran's.  Jafari agreed.  ------------------------------------- Jafari Sensitive on Intel Authorities -------------------------------------  4.  (S/NF) The Prime Minister welcomed word from General Casey that the National Intelligence Committee had met for the first time on July 14 with the Ministers of Defense and Interior, National Security Advisor Rubai'e and MNF-I representatives.  The Prime Minister launched into a lengthy discussion about the Iraqi side needing to coordinate with MNF-I but he was adamant that their authority to coordinate did not give them the authority to make important decisions. They would need to come to him for that, he emphasized. Jafari also emphasized that the relationship between the intelligence services and the Prime Ministry was a sensitive one; he was fielding questions from parliamentarians about it.  He indicated that while he had nothing against Iraqi National Intelligence Service director Shahwani, he probably would have to let him go given concerns about him in the National Assembly.  --------------------------------- Detainees - Jafari Agrees to Move ---------------------------------  6.  (C) The Charge and General Casey urged the Prime Minister to appoint Iraqi officials with whom we could start planning the transfer of detainees from Coalition to Iraqi control. When he understood the issue, Jafari readily agreed.  The government is under pressure to release innocent detainees but also under pressure to sternly punish those guilty of terrorist acts.  The government would operate under the premise that the greater the crime, the greater the punishment.  He said would have Interior Ministry Undersecretary Adnan Assadi to be the lead Iraqi contact.  He would be charged with collecting the details and ensuring coordinating between the Iraqi Interior and Justice ministries and the Coalition.  Jafari stressed that Assadi had his "total confidence."  --------------------------------- Israel Boycott and Iraqi Politics ---------------------------------  7.  (C) Charge also raised Pepsi-Cola's problem registering its trademark in Baghdad because Trade Ministry officials were imposing old Israel boycott laws against the company. Charge underlined that the CPA abolished those laws.  Trade Minister Abdel Basset wants approval from the Prime Minister to issue a ministerial circular reminding the staff that the boycott laws are no longer in effect.  Charge urged the PM to give the Minister that approval.  8.  (C) Jafari was reluctant because it would carry heavy political risks.  He pointed to the political gamemanship in the National Assembly and said his intervening could make him an easier target in an emotional debate.  He opined that the Trade Minister could issue the circular without seeking permission from the Prime Ministry.  "He does that everyday," Jafari quipped.  Jafari told Charge to go back to the Trade Minister and get him to issue the circular.  9.  (U) REO HILLAH, REO BASRAH, REO MOSUL, REO KIRKUK, minimize considered. Satterfield

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 002979  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PTER, IZ, National Assembly, Terrorism, Security SUBJECT: TNA PUSHING FOR STRONG RESPONSE TO TERROR ATTACKS   Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Ford. Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (U) The Transitional National Assembly is taking a more public and critical role in national security policy following the latest string of suicide attacks in Iraq.  TNA Speaker Hachim al-Hasani on July 17 proposed a three-minute moment of silence on Wednesday, July 20 at noon in memory of the victims of the Musayib bombing.  2.  (C) The representatives passed that recommendation with a unanimous vote, but not before pushing a much wider array of more activist remedies.  Influential cleric and SCIRI member Jalal al-Din al-Sagheer used the occasion to revive calls for the formation of Popular Security Committees.  (Comment:  In Iraqi political lexicon, a popular or local security committee usually means militias or irregular security forces.  End Comment.)  He described the string of attacks as a failure by MNF-I and said such committees needed to be formed to avert civil war.  He called upon the Sunni leadership to condemn Ba'athists and terrorism.  Shia parliamentarian Khudayr al-Khuzai'e warned that the Shia would eventually start retaliating for attacks against them and also urged that popular security committees be established.  The TNA heard a classified report on the security situation in the July 18 session.  We have heard that that report also pushed for the security committee idea and called for deeper de-Ba'athification and restructuring in the security ministries.  The head of Iraq's intelligence service may also be called in for questioning.  3.  (C) Comment:  We have batted down the idea of Popular Security Committees in meetings with SCIRI leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim.  SCIRI dropped the idea after our warnings about militia formation but clearly never dropped the idea.  We will be meeting with members of the TNA Security and Defense Committee July 19 to hear the details of their classified report and see whether this idea has emerged in force.  Until then we will continue to caution against vigilantism or militia activity as false solutions to a pressing security problem.  4.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002980  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2015 TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PTER, KDEM, IZ, Kuristan Regional Government, Sunni Arab SUBJECT: KURDISTAN PRESIDENT FORGING CONSENSUS AMONG SUNNIS; SAYS FEDERALISM MUST "JUSTLY DISTRIBUTE WEALTH AND POWER"  REF: BAGHADAD 2780  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Kurdistan-Iraq President Massoud Barzani told Charge on July 14 that his regional government had scored recent successes against insurgents in the north, but felt that overall Iraqi security had witnessed only moderate improvement over the past year.  He said he was working to produce a unified Sunni leadership, but noted some elements of the community were working at cross-purposes with the Kurds.  Barzani's closest politburo confidante, Fadil Mirani, sketched out Kurdish desires for "historic geographic" federalism, and Barzani noted the Kurds and Shia would share oil income with the Sunnis.  Charge and NSC Senior Director for Iraq stressed the importance of TAL provisos that natural resources remain under the control of a central government in Baghdad.  Barzani and Mirani expected progress to unify the two Kurdish administrations soon; Mirani said some Kurds were opposing holding new regional elections in December.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C)  Charge and visiting NSC Senior Director for Iraq Meagan O'Sullivan called on Kurdistan-Iraq President Massoud Barzani in Salah ad Din on July 14, and thanked him for the critical role the Kurds continue to play in forging a new era of peace in Iraq.  (PolCouns, RC Kirkuk, and MNFI-I director for policy also attended the meeting.)  O'Sullivan said there were many challenges still facing Iraq, we would continue to look to the Kurds and Barzani in particular to help achieve positive outcomes.  Barzani said he was committed to achieving a federal, pluralistic, democratic Iraq. O'Sullivan asked Barzani to help keep pressure on the political process to ensure compliance with the timeline for the constitution, referendum, and elections outlined in the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL).  She noted that the constitution need not address every difficult politiQl issue and that some - such as the final status of Kirkuk - may best be dealt with outside the constitution and through the implementation of Article 58 in the TAL.  Barzani said he would do what he could to ensure the timelines were met and stated that he would not support any proposal that would jeopardize the deadlines.  He noted that the resolution of Kirkuk would take time and patience.  Ansar al-Sunna Cell Defeated in Irbil -------------------------------------  3.  (C)  Barzani said that security in Kurdistan was relatively good.  He and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Politiburo Executive Director Fadil Mirani (whom charge met separately on July 14) both noted the KRG's recent success in arresting a major cell of Ansar al-Sunna that was planning operations in the north.  Over 200 people had been arrested, many with links to jihadist efforts in Afghanistan.  Promoting New Sunni Leadership? -------------------------------  4.  (C)  Overall in Iraq, Barzani felt that security was not optimal, although there were some improvements since last year.  He said different groups of insurgents needed different solutions.  Some would only be eliminated through a tough response, others could be brought in through economic or social levers.  5.  (C)  He said he was planning to convene Sunni Arab leaders with the idea of getting them to agree on new leadership.  He felt there was some chance the effort would succeed, as it included members of the Iraqi Islamic Party, National Dialog Council, the Muslim Scholars Association, the Fatwa Association, and the Sunni Waqf, as well as tribes and other leaders. (Comment:  Our sense is that such a group of Sunni Arabs would never allow Barzani much say in who their leadership would be.  End Comment.)  Kurds Want Historic Geographic Federalism . . . --------------------------------------------- --  6.  (C)  Barzani said it had been good to include Sunni Arabs in the constitutional process, but there were still some who were unwilling to acccept the concept of power sharing.  He said these elements might blackmail the Kurds; if that happened, the Kurds would work to marginalize them.  Barzani said this was a very sensitive period, "either we stay together or we separate," but noted that separation would not be in anyone's interests.  He said that the Kurds were working to explain their view of federalism to the Sunni Arabs, one that would be based on the "just distribution of wealth and power."  Mirani noted that the Kurds had agreed that federalism would be a "historic geographic" federalism, not based on administratively determined borders at the provincial level.  (Comment:  As we noted in ref, this stance on "geographic" federalism could be very problematic in terms of securing Sunni Arab agreement.  End Comment.)   . . . and Agree to "Share Oil" with the Sunnis --------------------------------------------- -  7.  (C)  Barzani said that some Sunnis were apprehensive that oil income would be in the hands of Shia and Kurds.  He noted that "we must give them their share of oil revenues of Kurdistan and the south."  8.  (C)  NSC Senior Director noted that the U.S. strongly supported TAL provisions leaving the income from natural resources in the hands of the central government.  This had reassured groups in regions that were resource-poor.  Such a system was also entirely consistent with the concept of federalism.  Charge agreed about the importance of central government control of resources.  He noted that the international community only permits sovereign entities to market their natural resources such as oil.  Furthermore, any other formula would frighten Sunnis who would feel they could be frozen out of any revenue stream.  The TAL formula removes their fear and thus keeps them engaged in the national political process, a critical priority for Iraq's stability.   Kurdish Unification -------------------  9. (C)  Barzani and Mirani both noted progress on unifying the Kurdish administrations of Irbil and Sulimaniya.  Mirani felt there might be an agreement on the cabinet before the end of July.  Barzani said he was working to diminish the role of political parties in government.  Election Preparations ---------------------  10.  (C)  Barzani told charge that he currently favored a province-based electoral district.  PUK and KDP politburos were currently discussing this issue; some in each party favored the retention of a single national electoral district.  He did not know what the final Kurdish position would be, but indicated that he would support movement to a provincial system.  Barzani felt it unlikely that new parties would emerge before December elections, they would not be able to establish credibility with the electorate.  New parties would likely emerge after that, he predicted.  11.  (C)  Mirani said that Kurds were currently debating the wisdom of conducting elections again in December.  Many felt that the regional government should just be able to keep the same four year term of past assemblies, rather than adhere to the "transitional" concept that the TAL envisioned for the provincial and national governments.   12.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BAGHDAD 002981  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2015 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, IZ, National Assembly, Kuristan Regional Government SUBJECT: AN AMBITIOUS KURDISH PROPOSAL SHARPENS THE CONSTITUTION DEBATE  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: The Kurdish delegation to the Constitution Drafting Committee has put together a detailed list of constitutional demands that is sharpening the debate on the future of federalism as delegates attempt to forge a draft document by 1 August.  The draft document calls for stronger limits on the size and authorities of Iraq's armed forces, wider rights for provincial guard forces, a clearer delineation of minority rights, and a set of conditions for dissolving the union.  The document lays out an ambitious vision of Kurdistan's authorities, including detailed provisions on natural resource ownership, guarantees on federal funds, and control of telecommunications and wage policies.  The document calls for a Kurdistan interest section in the Foreign Ministry and in all foreign embassies, and it seeks to guarantee four Kurdistan-nominated seats on the Supreme Court as well as a soft veto on national legislation.  2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED: Sunni Arab delegates and several Shia leaders are balking at this thick packet of Kurdish demands.  TNA Deputy Speaker Shahristani told Charge July 18 that the proposals went too far and was relieved to hear we are weighing in.  Other Shia politicians like Qasem Daoud is also concerned, although he appeared willing to talk about parts of it. Spooked Sunni Arab delegates are now looking to postpone the issue of federalism altogether and simply maintain the status quo.  As a compromise some Sunni Arabs have suggested decentralization to the governorate and regional level provided all current provincial boundaries remain unchanged.  Other debates continue over provisions on religious freedoms, but the details of federalism are clearly the largest obstacle between the committee and an agreed draft by August 1.  We are pushing all sides to stick to the deadline, continue their daily negotiating sessions, and achieve a federalism compromise that reassures those who suffered under totalitarianism  without threatening the territorial integrity and solvency of the country. END SUMMARY.  3. (C) The Kurdish Alliance List delegation to the Constitution Drafting Committee has put together a detailed list of constitutional demands that is sharpening the debate on the future of federalism.  The document offers amendments to the TAL and entirely new provisions to the constitution, many of which are annotated with supporting rationale or examples from relevant foreign political systems.  Taken together, and laid out below, the presentation represents an ambitious vision of Kurdish provincial rights in Iraq:  -- A BROAD MAP OF "KURDISTAN PROVINCE": The list of proposals, all presented in the name of the Kurdish Alliance List, was attached to a shaded map identifying "The Kurdistan Province of Iraq" with dramatic border amendments.  The map shades in all of Kirkuk province and all of northeast and northwest Ninewa province, stopping just short of encompassing Telafar and the west side of Mosul (the east side of the city would be in Kurdistan).  The map even makes a claim to a non-contiguous northern slice of Wasit Province including the town of Badra.  -- ADDING OVERVIEW LANGUAGE ON RESOURCE DIVISION:  The document calls for a subtle amendment to TAL Article 4, which states that "powers shall be shared between the federal government and the regional government, governorates, municipalities and local administrations."  The Kurdish document amends that sentence to note that both "powers and resources" shall be shared.  -- STRONGER LIMITS ON MILITARISM:  The document calls for a detailed exposition of military authority and its limits where TAL Article 5 simply states that Iraq's armed forces shall be subject to civilian control.  That article then refers the reader to chapters three and five, both of which restate the principle of civilian control without considerable elaboration.  The Kurdish document attempts to establish that Iraq's military expenditures not be higher than four percent of the total budget; that a legal ceiling be set for the quantity and quality of Iraq's armaments; and that the forces be forbidden from deployment outside of Iraq or inside any province without a three quarters majority in the National Assembly.  The Kurdish document also offers a provision that states, "Loyalty to Iraq is the basic standard for acceptance into the armed forces, without distinction on the basis of gender, race, religion or sect."  -- LOOSENING THE MILITIA BAN:  The Kurdish document offers alternative language that adds nuance to and detracts from the force of the TAL Article 27 B prohibition of all armed forces and militias "not under the command structure of the Iraqi Transitional Government."  The Kurdish document reads, "Provinces that border foreign countries will have forces for self-defense with the mission of defending the international borders of the Federal Republic of Iraq, preventing terrorism in the provinces, and helping the armed forces when necessary.  The size, bases, organization, and armaments of these forces, along with their relationship with the Defense Ministry, will be set by the provincial assemblies." Marginalia on the document indicate that the Kurds are ready to have the National Assembly share authority with the provincial assemblies in legislating these provisions. A side-note on the Kurdish document cites U.S. Constitution Article 2 Section 8 as an inspiration for this suggestion. That section of the U.S . Constitution puts certain military authorities in the hands of the states by laying out congressional authorities as follows: "To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress."  -- SPELLING OUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS:  The Kurdish document meets a major minority group demand by offering each religion its rights by name.  The proposed text echoes TAL Article 7 (A) language on Islam as the official religion before delving into deeper detail on religious guarantees in a way the TAL never did.  The proposed text reads, "Islam is the official religion of state and is a source of legislation.  This constitution respects the Islamic identity of the majority of the Iraqi people and guarantees all religious rights for Christians, Yezidis, Sabean Mandeans, and Kaka'is in the freedom of belief and the practice of religious rituals."  -- SPELLING OUT ETHNIC IDENTITIES: The Kurdish document also meets a demand from minorities and asserts Kurdish rights by spelling out Iraq's ethnic composition in more detail.  TAL Article 7 (B) currently simply reads, "Iraq is a country of many nationalities, and the Arab people in Iraq are an inseparable part of the Arab nation."  The proposed text would read, "The state of Iraqi is made up of a voluntary union of two principle nationalities, Arab and Kurdish, and this constitution establishes their rights on the principle of equality.  The Arab people in Iraq are a part of the Arab ummah (nation) and the Kurdish people in Iraq arte part of the Kurdish ummah, and this constitution also establishes the legitimate rights of the Turkmen, Chaldo-Assyrians, and Armenians."  An appended observation on the Kurdish document notes that the Kurds are prepared to erase the reference to the Kurdish ummah if the Arabs are ready to erase the reference to the Arab ummah.  -- ENSURING "KURDISTAN'S" DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION:  The Kurdish document recommends an addition to TAL Article 25 (A) which lists the Iraqi Transitional Govenrment as having "exclusive competence in... formulating foreign policy, diplomatic representation, negotiating, signing and ratifying international treaties and agreements, formulating foreign economic and trade policy and sovereign debt policies. . ." The Kurdish amendment would add, "The province of Kurdistan will be represented in a bureau in the Foreign Ministry and in embassies for the oversight of its affairs."  -- LIMITING FEDERAL ECONOMIC, COMMUNICATION AUTHORITY:  The Kurdish draft recommends eliminating the provision of TAL Article 25 (D) that allows the central government to "formulate a general policy on wages."  The Kurdish document notes that differences in supply and demand and living standards in the provinces, in addition to the labor force, make this matter best handled on the provincial level.  The Kurdish document also proposes eliminating central government control of telecommunications policy established in TAL Article 25 (G).  A later recommended article seeks to establish provincial supremacy in the administration of federal offices located outside of Baghdad.  The provision reads, "The provincial government will administer the federal apparatus within the provincial borders in consultations with relevant federal authorities."  -- DIVIDING NATURAL RESOURCES: The Kurdish draft document recommends a far more detailed delineation of natural resource divisions than anything offered in the TAL.  Draft language reads, "1. Ownership of natural resources will be in the hands of the provinces.  2. Ownership of the oil and mineral resources will be in the hands of the provinces, and the provincial government will exploit, administer, and distribute these raw products of investment in these resources in the following manner:  A. Five percent of the oil or minerals will go to the producing governorate.  B. 60 percent of the raw oil and mineral products extracted from a province will go to the provincial government.  C. 35 percent of the remaining raw output of oil and minerals will go to those provinces and governorates that lack these resources." Here the Kurdish document observes that the Sudanese central government and southern Sudanese government split resources approximately 50/50 and monitor their exploitation and distribution through a jointly-run "National Independent Petrol Commission."  -- ENSURING PROVINCES RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS:  The Kurdish draft document attempts to guarantee that money from the central government will reach provincial coffers.  One provision reads, "Each province should have its own character and independent budget funded directly from federal revenue, international loans given to the provinces via the central government, and provincial resources.  The percentage of the federal budget directed to Kurdistan shall be decided on the following principles:  1. It shall be a fair percentage not less than the percentage of Iraq's population found within the province.  2. No less than 5 percent of the national budget should be provided to Kurdistan as compensation for destruction from the war imposed upon it since 1960 and the injuries to its citizens from the use of chemical weapons and policies of genocide and scorched earth."  -- ESTABLISHING A PROVINCIAL RIGHTS INSTITUTE:  The documents calls for the formation of an "Institute for the Guarantee of Provincial Rights."  The body, it states, should be formed in cooperation with the institutions and ministries of the federal government.  It should conduct research projects and trips to attend and hold provincial and international conferences.  Representation at such events should be split between the provincial and central governments.  The institute should be led by a rotating presidency.  -- ESTABLISHING A MONITORING BODY ON BUDGET AFFAIRS: The Kurdish document attempts to put a closer watch on federal government distributions through the establishment of a monitoring body to be called the "Supreme Institute for the Monitoring and Allotment of Federal Revenues."  Membership would be drawn from experts from the provinces and from the central government.  The body would have the following responsibilities: "1. Check the just distribution of international grants, aide, and loans in accordance with provincial entitlements.  2.  Check the optimum use of federal revenue and its division.  3.  Check the transparency and justness in the distribution of government money to the provincial entities in accordance with the percentages found in the constitution."  -- SETTING CONDITIONS FOR DISSOLVING THE UNION:  The Kurdish document seeks to ensure that the Kurds are not locked into a destructive union by establishing the ways the constitution can be undermined.  One extensive provision reads, "The people of Iraqi Kurdistan have the right to decide their fate through a referendum to be established under the constitution 8 years after the introduction of this constitution or (immediately) in the following circumstances:  1. A change to the federal democratic system. 2. Their exposure to aggression or persecution. 3. The partition of a region known according to geography and historic fact to be a part of Kurdistan.  3. Failure to reconnect those areas that were separated and institution of demographic changes to those areas or any other areas."  Here too the document points out that the people of southern Sudan have the right to determine their fate at the end of a six-year transitional period.  -- A SOFT PROVINCIAL VETO ON FEDERAL LEGISLATION: One recommended provision seeks to establish a vague provincial veto right on federal legislation. It reads, "Any legislation passed at a national level in Iraq that affects one of the provinces must be based on consensus and respect for the privileges of the citizens of the province.  And any legislation that differs from this (principle) will not be considered effective in the provinces. "  Here too the text references the Sudanese peace agreement as a model.  -- ENSURING A KURDISH VETO IN THE SUPREME COURT:  The Kurdish provisions go so far as to establish assurances of a Kurdish veto on the Supreme Court.  One provision states, "The Supreme Court will be composed of 11 members.  The Kurdistan Judicial Council in agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Assembly will nominate four of them.  A three-quarters majority is needed for all decisions in the court."  --------------------------- Sunni Arabs Balking at a Wide Federalist Vision ---------------------------  4. (C) Faced with that thick packet of Kurdish demands, several Sunni Arab delegates have reportedly called for postponing a settlement on the details of federalism.  TNA Constitution Committee Member Ali al-Dabagh and Sunni negotiator Mijbel Shaykh Isa told PolCouns July 17-18 that the Sunnis have responded with a choice of three counter-proposals:  -- Maintain the status quo, treating Kurdistan as the only federal entity in Iraq and enabling other regions only to exercise "administrative" authority, not "political authority" or  -- give each of the eighteen governorates "political authority," to include control over local legislation and courts, but not allowing them to form separate regions or  -- delay any decision on federalism until after the December 2005 elections.  According to Mijbel Shaykh Isa, the Sunni Arab negotiators are united on this menu.  He said they had put the proposal forward in writing and await a response from the other members of the committee.  5. (C) Sunni Arab delegate Shaykh Muhammad Abed Rabbo al-Jaburi offered a fuller summary of Sunni Arab concerns in a July 18 meeting with Poloff.  He said that he was not opposed to federalism in principle, but did not want the committee to bite off more than it could chew.  He suggested preserving Kurdish rights in the north without undertaking an expansion of Kurdistan or any amendments to the provincial map in the south of Iraq.  A native of Mosul, Jaburi said he found the Kurdish map "expansionist" not federalist, particularly in its claims in Ninewa province.  (Comment: Mijbel Shaykh Isa repeated this to us separately.  We note that the Kurdish proposal, if adopted would make such prominent Iraqis as Shaykh Ghazi al-Yawer and Shaykh Fawaz al-Jarba citizens of the Kurdish region.  End Comment.) Al-Jaburi said he was particularly concerned about Iranian influence over the southern provinces if they were given too much authority at a time when the central government is still weak.  He said that concern applied to the south more than to Kurdistan.  He said the best course of action would be the creation of a framework for future federal decisions while limiting the system to "administrative" matters, not political ones for the time being.  Deputy Constitution Committee Chairman Fuad Ma'asum told PolCouns July 17 that delaying federalism disputes would merely "put a time bomb for our future."  ----------------------- More Unity on Rights than Previously Perceived -------------------------  6. (C) Shaykh al-Jaburi put forward a strong position on political freedoms that approached ideas favored by the Kurds.  Where Ma'asum painted the Sunni Arabs as opposing the designation of Kurdish as an official language, Jaburi said he supported the idea.  Jaburi said he further supported any provisions that banned the government from combating "thoughts or beliefs," whatever their basis.  He aimed, he said, to extend the guarantees offered to religious groups to people of all convictions.  After all he said, the Ba'athists "fought the communists like they were infidels."  Jaburi said he had no problem with declaring Kurdish an official language of Iraq and preferred that the national identity be devoid of references to Arabism or Islam.  Calling citizens Iraqis should be sufficient, he said.  ----------------------- Preparing for the Worst -----------------------  7. (C) Kurdish negotiator Ma'asum was still preparing for the worst.  He said he remained attached to the idea of holding a constitutional conference as an alternative way of producing a consensus on the document in the event that Sunni Arab delegates back out.  Ma'asum said he could think of numerous Sunni Arab leaders not on the committee who deserved to be invited to such a conference and he questioned the constituencies of the men on the committee.  He scoffed at their commitment to language on the Arab "ummah" and said several of them have taken to referring to a Sunni "marja'iya," or quasi--religious authority, that is none other than the hard-line  Muslim Ulema Council.  -------------------------------- Comment: A Classic Opening Offer --------------------------------  8. (C) The Kurdish draft document represents a classic maximalist opening bid at the start of a heated negotiating process.  Several Kurdish officials have stated more flexibility on issues of revenue sharing and resource ownership than those found in this document, but they want to give themselves room to compromise.  The Kurds have told us they have no intention of redrawing Iraq's borders at this stage, but that did not stop them from putting forward a highly provocative and expansionist map of Kurdistan's boundaries to accompany this document.  Here too they are staking out a maximalist position so that they have room for future compromises.  9. (C) What the Kurds are forgetting is that their negotiating theatrics are only confirming some of their negotiating partners' worst fears.  Calls for a Kurdish interests section in the Foreign Ministry and in foreign embassies only confirm suspicions that the Kurdish leadership is fundamentally unprepared to accept its status as equal plain "Iraqi" citizens of this state.  Of more concern is their call for a detailed set of conditions for dissolving the union. That set of conditions is more likely to weaken the constitution than strengthen it.  It will open the door to endless debates from rejectionists pointing out real or imagined slights that must "constitutionally" dissolve the agreement.  The right way to handle Kurdish fears is to pass limits on military authority and force structure like those laid out in these draft provisions.  A similar technique could be used to allay Sunni Arab concerns over Iranian influence and Kurdish secession: perhaps there could be clearer language banning provincial governments from seceding or independently forging relationships with foreign countries.  10. (C) We will continue pushing all sides to stick to their deadline and find ways to treat concerns while keeping this document an expression of hope, not just a hedge against worst fears and sectarian threats.  11.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002984  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  LONDON FOR TSOU  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KJUS, IZ, Ad Dujayl trial, Saddam Hussein SUBJECT: AL DUJAIL CASE REFERRED TO IRAQI SPECIAL TRIBUNAL  1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On July 17, the chief investigative judge for the Iraqi Special Tribunal ("IST") referred the Al Dujail case to the IST's trial chambers.  The case, in which Saddam Hussein is a defendant, will focus on the killing of hundreds of people from the town of Al Dujail.  Under the IST's Rules of Procedure, the trial cannot start before a 45-day period elapses, during which the defendants may prepare for trial, file motions in the trial chambers, or appeal the case's referral.  Post's best estimate is that the trial is unlikely to start before mid-October. END SUMMARY.  ------------------- Al Dujail Referral -------------------  2. (U) In 1982, Saddam Hussein made an official visit to the town of Al Dujail; once there, members of the Shia-affiliated Da'wa party attacked his motorcade.  Saddam escaped injury. In the ensuing weeks, his regime allegedly retaliated against the entire town, executing hundreds of people after sham trials conducted by a special court under Saddam's control. The regime allegedly also destroyed the town's date palm orchards, the primary source of revenue for Al Dujail.  On July 17, 2005, the chief investigative judge for the IST referred the Al Dujail case to the IST's trial chambers.  The named defendants in the referral are Saddam Hussein; Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti; Taha Yaseen Ramadan; and Awad Hamad Badr al-Bandar.  The referral may contain up to six additional defendants as well. We have not seen the referral document in English, but we believe that all are charged with crimes against humanity under Article 12 of the IST statute.  RCLO currently is having the entire investigative file, which contains the referral document, translated into English.   --------------------------------------------- What Happens Now? Trial Date and Proceedings. ---------------------------------------------  3. (U)  We expect the trial chamber to set a trial date soon.  Under the IST's Rules of Procedure, at least 45 days before the trial, the prosecutor must disclose to the defendant all evidence, including all witness statements, and the prosecutor and defense must exchange names of witnesses.  No evidence yet has been turned over by either side.  The defense may choose to make motions of an evidentiary nature to the trial court (including motions objecting to lack of defense counsel access to the defendant, inadequate investigation by the investigative judge, and lack of access to witnesses).  The defense also may choose to file an appeal to the Appellate Chamber.  The grounds for appeal could include jurisdictional challenges, invocation of immunity or amnesty, violations of Iraqi criminal procedure, an argument that the court has not been properly constituted in accordance with its own requirements, and other issues of this nature.  Thus, by virtue of the 45-day discovery rules, the Al Dujail trial can occur no sooner than the second week in September.  However, in RCLO's view, it is unlikely that the Al Dujail trial will occur before mid-October.  RCLO anticipates, however, that the Appellate Chamber quickly will decide any issue brought before it.  4. (U) Trial Proceedings.  The IST trials will unfold differently than U.S. trials do.  First, both the Iraqi and IST criminal justice systems are "crime-based," rather than "defendant-based."  Thus, the investigative judge is required to consider all of the evidence relating to a particular criminal event, and incorporate into one investigative record all claims and defendants relating to that event.  Saddam Hussein and others will stand trial in multiple cases; Saddam will not be charged in one large indictment for all of the crimes of which he is accused.  Second, as in other civil systems, virtually all of the information is gathered before the trial, rather than at the trial.  By the time of the trial, the investigative judge, prosecutor, and defense counsel will have had an opportunity to interview all witnesses they deem relevant to their case; the trial chamber will have resolved all pretrial motions; and the parties will have had time to review the investigative record.  The main purpose of the trial is to present the investigative record to the trial chamber and to allow the trial chamber to engage in a dialogue with the defendant on the merits of the investigative record.  The trials therefore likely will unfold in a lower-key way than U.S. trials do.  ----------------- Remaining Issues -----------------  5. (SBU)  Several issues remain to be resolved prior to the start of trial proceedings.  These include establishing a defense counsel assistance office, appointing international advisers/observers, strengthening witness security measures, improving media relations, and improving courtroom logistics and technology.  RCLO continues to work with the IST to resolve these issues. 6. (SBU) Housing.  We have heard complaints from the Iraqi government and in the press that trials cannot move forward until the IST judges are safely housed in the International Zone.  The USG has made housing in the IZ available to all IST judges, including investigative, trial, and appellate judges.  Although not all judges have opted to accept that housing, RCLO stands ready to provide housing to any IST judge that so desires.  7.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002985  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2015 TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KJUS, PREL, XF, IZ, Ba'ath SUBJECT: EXECUTIVE PRESSURE ON IRAQI SPECIAL TRIBUNAL INTENSIFIES  REF: BAGHDAD 2395  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (S) Political pressure on the judges of the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) heightened recently with the attempt - quashed for now - of Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi's supporters on the De-Ba'athification Committee to remove thirteen IST judges. The referral of the IST's first criminal case on June 17th (reported septel) may ease pressure on the IST from the Prime Minister's office, which has complained repeatedly about delays, but the intensely politicized atmosphere surrounding the court's operations is unlikely to dissipate soon.  ----------------------------- DE-BA'ATHIFICATION AT THE IST -----------------------------  2.  (S) On June 10th, the Regime Crimes Liaison Office (RCLO) was notified by an advisor with close contacts in the office of Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi that the National De-Ba'athifcation Committee had drafted a letter demanding the removal of thirteen of the fifty-four judges of the Iraq Special Tribunal, as well as an assortment of administrative staff, due to their former membership of the Ba'ath Party which is listed as a disqualification for service in the IST statute.  3.  (S) In practice, this requirement has been disregarded. Ba'ath membership was required of all practicing judges under Saddam's regime; most IST judges, including IST Chief Investigative Judge Ra'ad, held the lowest level of party membership, which is not considered a disqualification in any other branch of Iraqi government. IST judges were interviewed and cleared for service by the De- Ba'athification Committee prior to their appointment to the Tribunal.  4.  (S) NOTE: RCLO believes it unclear that the De- Ba'athification Committee is authorized to remove IST judges even should they be disqualified from service by former Ba'ath membership, given provisions in the TAL stating that the judiciary shall "in no way be administered by the executive authority" and that removal of a judge must be accomplished through a complex procedure initiated by the Higher Juridical Council. END NOTE  5. (S) More directly, the TAL states that the IST statute "exclusively defines" the IST's jurisdiction and procedures, notwithstanding any other part of the TAL, and provides that the judges of the IST "shall be appointed in accordance with the provisions of its founding statute". The TAL thus establishes the IST statute as the exclusive legal document governing the IST's judicial appointments and procedures. Post does not believe the CPA Order establishing the De-Ba'athification Committee should be read to trump the TAL. End note.)  6.  (S) In conversations with DPM Chalabi and other senior IST leaders, Embassy noted that the abrupt and politicized removal of key IST judges, including Judge Ra'ad, would slow the course of upcoming trials and ongoing investigations, including the ad-Dujail case, and would likely result in the withdrawal of RCLO investigative, advisory, and administrative support.  7.  (S) While no judges have yet been removed, it is unclear whether we have successfully dampened Chalabi's enthusiasm for tinkering with the court's makeup: on July 17, RCLO learned that the IST Administrative Director and other high-level non-judicial staff named in the letter had been removed. Other ITG officials continue to express unhappiness at the IST's pace, with PM aide Bashar al-Naher blaming an unlikely collusion between Ba'athist IST judges and "the Americans" for preventing the timely appearance of Saddam and other former regime leaders at trial. 7.  (S) Threats to the IST's independence may also come from the Transitional National Assembly, which plans on July 20 to debate legislation amending the IST's charter to bring the Tribunal under the control of the Iraqi Higher Juridical Council. Many IST judges feel - realistically or not - that any such move will result in the replacement of independent IST judges with hand-picked Chalabi supporters.  ------------------------------- HIGH-VALUE DETAINEE DISPOSITION -------------------------------  8.  (S) Under the circumstances, RCLO continues to monitor the IST's bringing of charges against High- Value Detainees (HVDs) in MNF-I custody closely. Using new evidence, the IST has provided reasonable grounds on which to proceed with investigative hearings on several HVDs previously approved by MNF-I for release (see reftel); in several other cases, RCLO expects the IST to vacate arrest warrants issued in the panic caused by Embassy and MNF-I's June announcement of impending HVD releases.  ------- COMMENT -------  9.  (S) DPM Chalabi has a complicated history with the IST, which was originally headed by his nephew, Salem Chalabi, before the younger Chalabi's August 2004 replacement following the issuance of an arrest warrant implicating him in murder. DPM Chalabi's ties to the Sadr Bureau may have created antipathy towards Judge Ra'ad, who issued the arrest warrant linking Moqtada al-Sadr with the killing of Abdul Majid al- Khoei. PM aide al-Naher's suggestion that the ITG might be satisfied with the removal of Judge Ra'ad alone (sparing the other twelve judges) may support to this conjecture.  10.  (S) Moreover, ITG leadership is keenly aware of the optics involved in the public trial of Saddam and other former senior regime leaders, and seems frustrated at ITG inability to "manage" the IST's independent judicial processes. The referral of the ad-Dujail case may ease pressure on the IST temporarily, but executive and legislative attempts at interference and influence are likely to continue. Satterfield 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 002987  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2025 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, IZ, Sunni Arab, IMF, ECON Development SUBJECT: DEPUTY SECRETARY'S MEETING WITH IRAQI PLANNING MINISTER BARHAM SALIH  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Iraq's Planning Minister Barham Salih told Deputy Secretary Zoellick on July 10 that key hurdles in finalizing a constitution include Sunnis' role in the process and the differing views of federalism held by the main ethno-religious communities. Zoellick emphasized the importance of sticking to the TAL timetable; Salih said it will be difficult but not impossible to do so.  The Minister hopes that the IRFFI donors conference on July 18-19 will provide a venue to translate the political support shown for Iraq at the Brussels conference of June 22 into action, although he recognized new pledges were unlikely.  Salih agreed when the Deputy Secretary emphasized the need for Iraq to demonstrate a clear policy direction to honor its commitments to the IMF to reduce subsidies, cut the budget deficit, and carry out other economic reforms, but noted there is politically-motivated foot-dragging among Prime Minister Jaafari's staff.  The Minister highlighted the importance of private investment for reconstruction and development in Iraq.  Salih suggested that the next JCRED be held inside Iraq.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (SBU) Deputy Secretary Zoellick met on July 10 with Iraqi Planning Minster Barham Salih on the occasion of the July 10-11 Joint Committee on Reconstruction and Development (JCRED).  3. (SBU) Participants: U.S. Deputy Secretary Zoellick Assistant Secretary/EB, Tony Wayne NSC Senior Director Meghan O'Sullivan D Executive Assistant Ross Wilson S/I Deputy Director Bob Deutsch Economic Minister-Counselor Anne Derse (notetaker)  For Iraq: Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation, Barham Salih Chief of Staff Ahmed Salman  ----------------------------- Constitution Drafting Process -----------------------------  4.  (C) Salih told the Deputy Secretary that there are now a large number of Sunnis in the constitution-writing process, but questions remain with respect to how representative they are and how cooperative they will be.  Some of those brought into the process want to stop it, while others genuinely want elections as soon as possible.  Salih said he disagreed with some who want an extension of the timetable.  An election is needed as soon as possible to legitimize Sunni participation in the political process.  5.  (C) The Minister said there is a move to change the elections law to have proportional representation at the governorate level.  The Shia support this move.  The Kurds would lose seats, but it probably would assure Sunni participation.  Even though the Sunnis retain a dim view of Kurds, Salih said the Sunnis "are our people, and we have to talk to them."  On other contentious issues related to the constitution, Salih noted the presence of a strong pro-federalist movement in the south of Iraq.  The Minister said with regard to Kirkuk that the Kurds had made a commitment to normalize the situation there after the constitution, and he made clear his view that there is no need for Kirkuk's status to be in the Constitution.  6.  (C) Zoellick emphasized the importance of sticking to the TAL timetable.  Salih strongly agreed, saying it will be difficult but not impossible to do so. He said Speaker Hassani agrees it can be done.  Noting that the EU constitution had fallen of its own weight, the Deputy Secretary told Salih that not every issue needs to be  SIPDIS addressed in the Iraqi constitution.  It can put in place a basic structure, leaving some issues for the future.  The Minister agreed that it would make sense to have a constitution with basic structure and modalities, but not all the details, leaving some issues for the future.  --------------------------------------- IRFFI Donors Conference/Economic Reform ---------------------------------------  7.  (C) Turning to the IRFFI donors conference that Jordan will host at the Dead Sea July 18-19, Salih said that it will be an important test as to whether the political support for Iraq shown at the June 22 Brussels conference would translate into action.  Salih hopes to agree on priorities for the next six months.  Donors want priorities; but everything in Iraq is a priority, and Salih therefore hopes to focus on job creation--where construction and housing are key sectors--as the overarching theme.  The Minister recognized this will not be a pledging conference, but underscored the political desirability of finding some new pledges if possible. Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs Wayne noted that the USG has contacted all invitees to urge they make new pledges and disburse pledges already made.  8.  (C) Noting his recent discussions with the IMF and World Bank leadership in Washington, Deputy Secretary Zoellick underscored the importance for Iraq of presenting to the IRFFI conference a short, prioritized, and action-oriented National Development Strategy draft, accompanied by an illustrative list of projects that lets donors know the ITG is focused.  A short document would be the most effective one.  He suggested the ITG present ranges or variables for the expected budget deficit so people know it is an issue that must be tackled.  The Deputy Secretary said the IMF and World Bank are pressing for integration of the development and operating financing budgets.  Progress on fuel subsidy reform, data provision, and the independent audit of the central bank are key for the IMF.  The ITG needs to demonstrate a sense of commitment and signal clear direction on subsidies, even as details remain to be worked out through the political process.  This will contribute to a positive IMF Board Review of Iraq in early August.  The Deputy Secretary offered to work with the ITG to encourage Fund and  SIPDIS Bank action with respect to Iraq.  9.  (C) Salih agreed the ITG must make decisions and bite the bullet on subsidies and the budget deficit.  Any government would think politically six months before elections, but the risk of inaction would be the unraveling of Iraq's historic debt reduction agreement.  Salih said he and Finance Minister Ali Allawi are pushing for economic reform and compliance with the IMF's Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) program.  He predicted action on fuel subsidies.  Prime Minister Jaafari understands the situation is serious, that it not sustainable, and that Iraq cannot get enough fuel to the people as a result of the subsidies.  Jordan had acted and so must Iraq.  The Minister acknowledged he is worried, however, about those close to the Prime Minister who point to the downsides of reform, arguing elections are only six months off.  In this context, headline-grabbing new pledges are very important.  10.  (C) Salih further agreed the budget process must be integrated, pledging that he and Allawi will integrate the budget, and the new donor coordination mechanism will be built around that process.  His vision is to spend $30 billion over the next two years, with funding split equally between Iraq and donors.  11.  (C) With reference to Iraq's need for resources, Salih said he is working hard on the investment law.  He sees no need to replace the CPA orders on foreign investment (nos. 39 and 46) as some have pushed to do.  Rather, the law will be elaborated with regulations.  The new Investment Promotion Agency and OPIC Investment Incentive agreements will play a key part in empowering the private sector.  Further, according to the Minister, Iraq's financial problems are pushing it to explore alternatives like build-own-operate (BOO) and build-own-transfer (BOT) agreements.  Salih said the government cannot provide all needed investment in the oil sector.  ---------- Next JCRED ----------  12.  (C) The Deputy Secretary suggested holding another JCRED meeting in the fall. Noting that USG engagement is very important to help push for reforms, Salih agreed but added it is politically important to conduct the meeting in Iraq -- in the capital or Irbil. He said the ITG is pushing the UN and World Bank to do more training in Iraq as well.  13.  (U) REO Hillah, Basrah, Kirkuk, and Mosul Minimize considered Satterfield

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi told the Deputy Secretary on July 12 that Iraq has exported for the first time in recent months oil from the Northern pipeline to Turkey. He expects a sustainable increase to 240,000 b/d in the northern oil fields.  An electric power crisis appears increasingly unlikely this summer, with power generation above 5,000 MW and nearing 6,000 MW by August. Chalabi admitted, though, that these gains in the oil and electric power sectors remain overshadowed by the insanity of Iraq's current pricing and subsidy policies.  He acknowledged that corruption in the Iraqi government's financial and contracting practices was a major problem.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (SBU) Deputy Secretary Zoellick met on July 12 with Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi.  A separate cable reports Chalabi's comments on political issues.  3.(SBU)  Participants: For the U.S. Government: Deputy Secretary Zoellick D Executive Assistant Ambassador Ross Wilson, S/I Deputy Director Robert Deutsch Adam Ereli, PA NSC Senior Director Meghan O'Sullivan Charge d'Affaires David Satterfield Economic Minister-Counselor Anne Derse Econoff (notetaker)  For Iraq: Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi  ------------------------------------- Good News, Bad News Stories on Energy ------------------------------------- 4.  (C) Chalabi announced that Iraq had exported 4 million barrels of crude--3 million from the south plus 1 million from the north--on July 10, and that for two weeks there had been no significant attacks on Iraq's oil infrastructure.  He said this was in large part because he had persuaded General Casey that exporting oil from the northern pipeline was a "major security issue," as important as re-taking Fallujah. The Deputy Prime Minister said he expected a sustained increase in production and exports from the northern fields of about 240,000 b/d, and noted that maintaining this level for four days would repay in full the $35 million set aside for three months of security enhancements along the northern oil pipeline.  Chalabi attributed the increased output to the effective performance of the 4th Division of the Iraqi National Army, working with the 42nd US division and air surveillance, which has been deployed to protect oil facilities.  Looking ahead to the longer run, he expressed the hope that repairs to the 14-inch Bayji-West and other pipelines will make it possible to boost northern output to 500,000 b/d.  5.  (C) Turning to oil production in the southern fields, Chalabi noted that the issue there was theft, not sabotage. The ITG had discovered seven taps into the export lines in the South.  The National Energy Council would address this, he said.  6.  (C) On electricity, the DPM said he believed Iraq can avoid a crisis this summer.  Electric power production is nearing the record level of 5,200 MW reached in mid-2002, and load-sharing is bearable for most Iraqis, with a pattern of three hours on/three hours off.  Noting that Iraq has an installed capacity for producing 8,100 MW of electric power, Chalabi expressed the hope that output will exceed 6,000 MW by August.  7.  (C) Chalabi admitted, though, that these gains in the oil and electric power sectors remain overshadowed by the insanity of Iraq's current pricing and subsidy policies. Refined fuel products are sold for $.015 a liter, and diesel is imported at the price of $.50 a liter to generate electricity that is effectively given away for free.  The DPM estimated that removing electricity subsidies could save $1 billion over the rest of this year.  8.  (C) Looking ahead, Chalabi said the best short-term fix for electric power in Iraq would be imports from neighboring states.  They can sell power for $.06/kwh, which is about half the cost of power generation in Iraq.  Over the longer-term, the solution will involve harnessing domestic hydro-power resources, such as at the site of the proposed Bekhmaa dam, as well as generating thermal power from the natural gas that currently is flared.  ------------------------- Corruption in Contracting ------------------------- 9.  (C) In response to the Deputy Secretary's query about how the government is functioning, Chalabi noted that financing and contracting--and by implication corruption--represented a key issue.  He said that contracting practices under the CPA and the IIG were terrible because no one followed the law or regulations.  Valuable contracts were paid in advance with no performance guarantees or bonds.  Goods were signed for as delivered when they were not; when they were delivered, they were not accounted for.  Chalabi said the ITG's Contracting Committee (which he chairs) has made a decision to cut Iraqi middlemen out of the food distribution system and deal only with major international companies for food procurement, especially those from the US, and Australia.  Iraq has just purchased 300 million tons of wheat from the US.  10.  (C) Electricity Ministry contracts were not properly managed, he said, in a veiled reference to allegations of corruption against the former Electricity Minister.  The Ministry of Defense was the "worst offender" with $ 100 million in contracts unaccounted for. The Contracting Committee had therefore decided that no ministries other than the Ministry of Finance may hold bank accounts; ITG obligations over 300 million Iraqi dinars must be paid by L/C, certified check, or bank transfer.  Although Iraq welcomes foreign banks, they have been slow to come.  Chalabi discounted foreign banks' presence as an engine for restructuring the moribund Iraqi banking sector, another major disaster.  11.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S/NF)  Summary: Prime Minister Jafari reiterated to the Deputy Secretary that security conditions on the ground, and not terrorist demands, should determine the manner of withdrawal of Coalition forces.  The Deputy Secretary agreed and noted approvingly the Prime Minister's naming of an Iraqi official with whom the U.S. could begin elaborating these conditions.  He also urged the Prime Minister to help enable an independent Iraqi judiciary to take over and review the cases of detainees now under Coalition control.  Jafari sought American help with neighboring Sunni Arab states that support terrorism in Iraq.  He said he was getting messages from Syria that the Syrians would change their policy on Iraq and they wanted the Prime Minister to visit.  However, Jafari would not visit Damascus until he sees concrete measures from the Syrians in terms of halting media incitement against Iraq, controlling the borders and cracking down on former Iraqi regime elements in Syria.  Jafari also sought help in arranging visits to Egypt and Saudi Arabia.   2.  (S/NF) Summary Continued. The Deputy Secretary cautioned that the Syrians excel at offering minimal concessions, and he urged the Prime Minister to hold out for the best deal possible.  He also cautioned the Prime Minister to ensure that agreements signed with the Iranians be clearly in the favor of Iraq to ensure the Iraqi Government's own credibility.  On the constitution, Jafari opined that the Iraqis would come to a deal, including most of the Sunni Arabs on the committee.  The Deputy Secretary noted the importance of sticking to the timeline in the transition law, as the issues would not get easier with a delay.  On the economy, Jafari said he anticipated the Iraqi government budget deficit would grow.  The Deputy Secretary cautioned against fiscal slippage as the year goes forward and said the IMF and World Bank were ready to help Iraq if Baghdad could develop a good plan on the use of oil revenues.

(C/NF) Jafari said Iraqi forces are growing stronger on the ground.  He sensed that the terrorists are changing from car bomb attacks to attacks on infrastructure and now attacks on foreign ambassadors.  More importantly, he said, help to Iraq on security issues now benefits not only Iraq.  Rather, Iraq is on the front line of the larger war on terror; those who struck London were the same as those responsible for the murder of the Egyptian Ambassador in Baghdad and other terrorism in Iraq.  Jafari mentioned in passing that he was facing questions from the National Assembly about his relations with the Coalition Forces and also the intelligence services.  He said he would want to discuss these issues when Ambassador Khalilzad returns to Baghdad.  (Comment:  Later on July 12, Jafari addressed the National Assembly about his decision to ask the U.N. at the end of May to maintain the Coalition forces in Iraq.  End Comment.)  5.  (C/NF) Jafari said while there were some in Iraq calling for Coalition Forces to withdraw, the timing should in fact be dictated by security conditions.  He underlined the importance of coordination between the U.S. and the Iraqi Government on the issue of withdrawal.  He also noted that the Prime Minister is the ultimate source of decision-making on security issues.  6.  (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary assured the Prime Minister that the U.S. would not withdraw before the mission is completed, as the President had said.  Decisions on the future of Coalition Forces would depend on circumstances on the ground.  The U.S. would work with the Iraqi national security team to establish those conditions.  The Deputy Secretary thanked the Prime Minister for appointing a lead  SIPDIS Iraqi official for us to work with on that task.  The Deputy Secretary also urged the Prime Minister to reach out to other  SIPDIS Coalition countries and underline the value of their contributions.  The Deputy Secretary also urged the Prime Minister to foster standing up the Iraqi forces by promoting officers on the basis of performance while also ensuring that Iraqi security forces remain under ultimate civilian control.  7.  (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary recalled how the judicial system under the Saddam regime had been cruel and unjust.  He encouraged the Prime Minister to work to build an independent, fair judicial system.  He reminded the Prime Minister that this would also require building facilities. The Iraqi Government would gain in credibility if the Iraqi judiciary starts to review the cases of detainees now under Coalition control.  ------------------------------------ SYRIA: JAFARI AWAITS CONCRETE STEPS ------------------------------------  8.  (C/NF) The Prime Minister said there were fewer infiltrations of Saudi nationals over the Syrian borders, but the infiltrations were still a problem.  He said he wanted to see the Syrian Government take practical steps to control the borders, crack down on former regime elements operating in Syria and return Iraqi assets.  Jafari referred to meetings in June with Syrian Foreign Minister Shara in Brussels and the Syrian Ambassador in London and said the Syrians are saying they will meet Iraqi demands.  Jafari said the Syrians want him to go to Damascus, and there are "serious efforts" underway to see if such a visit can happen.  The Deputy Secretary cautioned the Prime Minister that the Syrians excel  SIPDIS at making minimum concessions.  The Syrian Government can control infiltration across the borders if it chooses.  He urged the Prime Minister to maintain pressure and secure the maximum possible from the Syrians before any visit  ------------------ USE CARE WITH IRAN ------------------  9.  (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary commented as well that the U.S. understands that Iraq needs good relations with Iran. The U.S. by contrast has a difficult relationship with Iran. He urged the Prime Minister to move forward with care, ensuring that he can justify agreements as positively benefiting Iraq each time.  This is important to sustain Iraq's credibility, he observed.  The Deputy Secretary contrasted a potential deal enabling Iraq to buy badly needed electricity from Iran with an oil deal in southern Iraq whose benefits for Iraq were less obvious.  10. (S/NF) In a session following the larger meeting, attended only by the Deputy Secretary and Charge, the PM said that the Iranians had offered to arrange a meeting in Teheran with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad.  Jafari said that he believed such a meeting would be useful as a means of beginning to improve Syrian-Iraqi relations, and would be better done outside Syria than in Damascus.  Bashar, Jafari asserted, was different from the rest of the Syrian regime; but he is surrounded by bad elements like VP Khaddam and (former) Baath Party head al-Ahmar.   Having approached Charge on the same issue the previous day through aide Laith Kubba and aware of strong USG reservations, Jafari was at pains to tell the Deputy Secretary that he would not want to do anything that would upset or anger the U.S.  11. (S/NF) The Deputy Secretary told Jafari that we understood Iraqi interest in improved relations with all its neighbors, including Iran and Syria.  But especially in the case of Syria, it was important for Iraq to demand and receive concrete steps from Damascus - on action against insurgent elements and on Iraqi assets - before taking steps that would then be used by Syria to ease the pressure which the Deputy Secretary told Jafari the U.S. was continuing to apply.  A meeting with Bashar al-Asad in Iran would be viewed very negatively by the U.S., he made clear. 12.  (S/NF) Jafari said he understood our message clearly. On Iran, he noted Defense Minister Dulaimi's recent visit (ref) and said that only limited, "very practical" steps on the security side were under discussion.  The PM's own trip to Teheran, planned for July 16, would focus on commercial/economic issues.  The Deputy Secretary said that we understood that there may be value in obtaining electricity from Iran, but we had concerns about the true economic value of some proposals being discussed regarding (possible barter) oil trade.  -------------- AND FROM JORDAN ---------------  13.  (C/NF) The Prime Minister said he thought the Jordanian position on Iraq was improving.  He contrasted King Abdallah's press remarks earlier this year about a Shia threat to the region with his remarks at a recent conference in Amman about Islam in which the King condemned terrorism and sectarianism.  The Prime Minister hoped to see concrete steps from Jordan with respect to Iraqi assets and former regime elements there too.  The Deputy Secretary suggested that King Abdallah wants to be helpful.  Highlighting the King's remarks at the Amman conference on Islam, the Deputy Secretary urged Jafari to work with Abdallah and the Prime  SIPDIS Minister of Malaysia, and others, to set a positive example of positive leadership among Muslim states.  ------------------------------ HELP US WITH SUNNI ARAB STATES ------------------------------  14.  (C/NF) Jafari asserted that the neighboring Sunni Arab states are basically hostile to the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad.  It would have been better to have a Sunni Arab as president in Iraq to ease Sunni sensitivities, but history went another direction.  Now Iraq needs American help to prevent interference from Sunni Arab states.  Pointing to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, he said "Sunni" money goes to terrorists; "Sunni" media supports terrorist acts and Sunni clerics lend credibility to terrorists.    --------------------------------- CONSTITUTION:  A DEAL IS POSSIBLE ---------------------------------  15.  (C/NF) The Prime Minister thought the inclusion of more Sunni Arabs in the constitution committee would help reduce Sunni Arab support for terrorism as well.  Jafari agreed with the Deputy Secretary that the document should not be too long and complicated.  Jafari said he thought a deal with the majority of the Sunni Arabs on the committee is possible, but they were putting tough issues on the table:  -- their insistence on the Arab identity of the Iraqi state would irk the Kurds.  Jafari said he personally agreed with the Sunni Arabs.  Iraq's Foreign Minister is a Kurd and he sits in the Arab League meetings, Jafari observed.  It would be difficult to say the Foreign Minister was not representing an Arab state when he does so.  -- their objection to federalism as potentially leading to the separation of Iraq was misplaced, Jafari opined.  The Prime Minister said he thought the constitution should establish the principle of federalism but not provide too much operational detail.  Jafari added that Iraq's current federalism is bad.  The Kurds are able to oppress minorities in the Kurdish region with impunity.  -- their raising the role of Islam and the state was scaring minorities.  Jafari said it would be important to secure minority rights in the constitution as it was done in the Transition Administrative Law (TAL).  --  their objection to government officials having dual nationality was not serious, Jafari opined.  --  their raising the status of the Baath party was more serious.  Jafari said some Baathists were trying to secure the party's goals by lobbying members of the constitution committee.  The TAL was clear:  the Baath party is gone. Jafari said each individual Baath party member can be dealt with on the basis of his own history.  Jafari opined most Iraqis would agree with this.  16.  (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary congratulated the Prime Minister for convincing Sunni Arabs to join the constitution committee.  He said the U.S. would urge them, and others, to stay on the timeline laid out in the TAL; issues would not get easier with a delay.  He also asked the Prime Minister to keep an eye on the election process itself.  For example, if the committee decides to change the system of electing members to the National Assembly, it needs to make the decision in time for the right preparations to be made.  The Deputy Secretary added that the independent election commission's credibility had been an important ingredient to the success of January 2005 elections, and he urged the Prime Minister to facilitate their work while respecting their independence.  ------------------------- ECONOMY:  FOCUS ON BUDGET -------------------------  17.  (C/NF) Prime Minister Jafari told the Deputy Secretary that Iraq faced a difficult budget situation.  In 2004, the government received USD 20 billion in revenues while its expenditures were USD 24 billion.  In 2005, its revenues again would total around USD 20 billion, but expenditures would grow to USD 25 billion.  The budget deficit therefore would grow from USD 4 to USD 5 billion.  Meanwhile, delivery of essential services was not improving.  Jafari said that he was anxious to increase private investment, and he had asked for American help.  18.  (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary welcomed the Prime Minister's focus on the budget, and praised the abilities of the Iraqi Finance and Planning ministers.  He urged Jafari to empower them.  The Deputy Secretary highlighted the chance for the July 18-19 international conference in Jordan to mobilize support for Iraq.  In September the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington would be another opportunity to highlight Iraqi needs.  The Deputy Secretary mentioned that he had recently met senior officials of the IMF and World Bank and found that they understood Iraq's special circumstances.  What the organizations need to see is a coherent policy and plans for step by step reform, including steps to bring the fiscal picture into balance.  The Deputy Secretary concluded that it would be important for the Iraqi  SIPDIS Government to stick to its debt reduction agreement and avoid fiscal slippage.   19.

BAGHDAD 2897      B. BAGHDAD 2872      C. BAGHDAD 2863  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C/NF) Summary: In a July 12 lunch meeting, President Jalal Talabani was optimistic that the Sunni Arabs in the constitution drafting committee will reach consensus with other committee members.  He predicted the next elections will use provincial electoral districts rather than a single national electoral district system.  Talabani noted his interest in restoring pensions to retired military and "cleaning up" the Presidency Council.  Citing Syria and Iran as the biggest security concerns, he pressed the need for a U.S.-Iraqi security strategy.  Talabani believes Arabs who arrived in Kirkuk under Saddam's arabization campaign should be allowed to remain in Kirkuk but not vote on its future status.  The Deputy Secretary conveyed the President's appreciation for Talabani's efforts to bring Sunni Arabs aboard the constitutional drafting process and indicated a visit to Washington by Talabani will be welcome after the constitution is completed.  End Summary  2. (U) PARTICIPANTS:  U.S.  Deputy Secretary Robert Zoellick Charge d' Affaires David Satterfield D Executive Assistant Ambassador Ross Wilson S/I Deputy Director Robert Deutsch Adam Ereli, PA NSC Senior Director Meghan O'Sullivan Political Minister Counselor Robert Ford Poloff (notetaker)  IRAQ  President Jalal Talabani Chief of Staff Kamaron Karadaghi  ----------------------------------------- Sunnis to Reach Consensus on Constitution -----------------------------------------  3. (C/NF) Sharing his amusement over the internal squabbling of the 15 Sunni Arabs who joined the constitution drafting committee, President Talabani assured the Deputy Secretary that the Sunnis will reach consensus and compromise with other committee members.  Talabani countered some Sunnis assertions that the 15 additional Sunnis in the committee do not represent Sunni Arab diversity.  "There are representatives from the Sunni Endowment, the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), and Sunni tribes," he argued.  4. (C/NF) The Deputy Secretary conveyed the President's appreciation for Talabani's efforts to bring Sunni Arabs aboard the constitutional drafting process and said the President looks forward to Talabani's visiting Washington after the Constitution is completed.  He remarked that in his meeting with Sunni committee members Adanan al-Janabi and Mujbil Shaykh Issa (the latter from Kirkuk), they listed federalism, Kirkuk, Iraq's  definition as an Arab nation, and dual nationality as the remaining sticking points in the drafting process.  ---------------------------------------- Provincial Districts for Next Elections? ----------------------------------------  5. (C/NF) Responding to the delegation's query over the most likely electoral system for the December elections, Talabani said he supported the increasingly popular proposal to have provincial electoral districts rather than the single national district system that was used in January.  Though Kurds might lose a few votes in the south, they would still be well represented in the northern and central areas of the country, he predicted.  Sunni Arabs, most Shia, even Ayatollah Sistani, appear to support the idea of provincial lists, except Moqtada al-Sadr's group, he said.  ---------------------------------- Cleaning up the Presidency Council ----------------------------------  6. (C/NF) Talabani prided himself in his initiative to clean up and organize the Presidency Council.  Talabani arrived at the Presidency to find no records of expenditures.  "Members of the Council received USD 2 million per month each, but we have no idea how they spent it," observed Talabani.  He said Deputy VP Abd Abdul al-Mehdi has prepared operating norms, but Deputy VP Gazi al-Yawr disagrees with some of the points.  Talabani had given his deputies an ultimatum to reach consensus by July 13.  ---------------------------- Addressing Military Pensions ----------------------------  7. (C/NF) To Talabani, restoring pensions to the thousands of retired Iraqi military veterans poses an immediate challenge.  Given that many of the retirees are Sunni Arabs, the fact that most have not received pensions in over two years is a sore issue for the Sunni community, explained Talabani.  The 300,000 military retirees (of them, some 6,000 Saddam-era generals and field marshals) at least deserve to receive what they contributed to the system, Talabani reasoned. (Note: Talabani estimates the combined number of active and retired government employees at three million people.)  --------------------------------------------- ----- Aggressive Syria A Threat, Subtle Iranians Another --------------------------------------------- -----  8. (C/NF) Commenting that Syria and Iran pose the most serious neighborhood threats to Iraq's security, Talabani said that of the two countries, the Iranians take a more subtle approach.  Syria was allowing some 70 insurgents per day to cross into Iraqi territory, estimated Talabani.  The Syrian government's recent arrest of some 1,400 insurgents is a good start, but not enough.  "Hundreds of thousands had come over," claimed Talabani.  9. (C/NF) Though Iranian involvement in Iraq is harder to detect than Syria's, continued Talabani, the Iraqi government has evidence of ties between the Iranian government and the terrorist groups Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Sunna.  These groups are stirring up trouble in Sunni Arab and Kurdish areas of Iraq. The Iranians have instructed them to refrain from activities in Iraqi Shia areas to make Iraqis believe that the Sunni and Kurdish areas are restive while the Shia populations are peaceful, asserted Talabani.  10.  (C/NF) Talabani observed that former President Khatami had been reasonable and easy to work with.  Khatami allowed Kurds on both sides of the border to visit one another and had encouraged their culture.  Khatami also allowed Shia Kurds to participate in his government, including his oil minister.  Talabani is uncertain how relations will evolve with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, observing that Ahmadjinejad once headed Iran's Iranian-Kurdish Affairs Office, which organized "operations" against Iranian Kurds. He said Ahmadinejad was very close to Ayatollah Khamani.  --------------------------------------------- --- Insurgency a Problem, but Less So, Says Talabani --------------------------------------------- ---  11. (C/NF) To the Deputy Secretary's query over the current level of insurgency and its strength relative to the past, Talabani listed the two categories of insurgency confronting Iraq: Al Qaeda, al-Zarkawi, Ansar Islam and Wahabbi outsiders on the one hand and disgruntled Iraqi Sunni Arabs on the other.  Talabani explained that the strength of the insurgents has diminished for three reasons:  Iraqi security forces are now better able to fight them; people are tired of the violence, and many of their key leaders have been killed or captured.  After the January elections, many Iraqi Sunnis realized violence was a "dead end" and are coming around to political participation. As people grew disenchanted with the insurgency, they began collaborating with the security forces.  Partisans are like fish and the people are the water.  If the water dries up, the fish die, he mused.  ----------------------------- We Need Your Help on Security -----------------------------  12. (C/NF) Reiterating his interest in establishing a joint U.S.- Iraqi security strategy, Talabani underscored the need for U.S. help to secure the Baghdad-Najaf, Baghdad-Baquba, and Baghdad-Kirkuk roadways; protect the Kirkuk pipeline; and deal with insurgency problems in Tal Afar and Mosul.  He also sought our support to remove the Baquba police chief, who Talabani alleges is too close to the insurgents.  --------------------------------------- Give Kirkuk Some Time, Suggests Talabani ----------------------------------------  13. (C/NF) On Kirkuk, Talabani said he expects to reach agreement with the Turkmen and the Shia Arabs on Kirkuk.  The Front of Turkmen of Kirkuk and the Shia Arabs, including a Sistani representative, support his initiative.  Talabani said Kirkuk's longstanding Arab population should be allowed to remain in Kirkuk and vote on Kirkuk's future status, while Arabs who arrived through Saddam's Arabization of Kirkuk could also remain in Kikurk, but not vote on its future.  The "Saddam" Arabs could register and vote in their places of origin and remain in Kirkuk, Talabani explained.  Alleging that Barzani is less flexible on Kirkuk, Talabani promised to try to convince him to support this "national solution."  The decision on Kirkuk should not occur immediately, however; only after one to three years, to allow time for Kirkuk to normalize, for its residents to reconcile, he suggested.  14.

Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1.  (C) Gunmen assassinated Sunni Arab constitution committee member Mujbil Shaykh Issa, Sunni Arab expert advisor Dhamin Aleiwi al-Ubaidi and their driver Aziz Isma'eel in Baghdad on July 19.  The three men were headed to a restaurant in the Karada neighborhood of Baghdad and had left the International Zone shortly beforehand after a full day of constitution-related meetings.  Issa and al-Ubaidi were friends and had worked together as law professors at Kirkuk University.  Both men were members and nominees of the National Dialogue Council.  Their assassination comes after two Sunni Arab supplemental members had previously withdrawn from the committee, reportedly in part after receiving threats (see reftel).  Two hardline National Dialogue Council members, Abd al- Naser al-Janabi and Fakhri Qaisi, replaced those two members officially this week.  2.  (C) Word of the assassination came in the midst of a constitution committee meeting and PolOff ran into the members as they emerged after hearing the news. They were stricken but defiant.  SCIRI member Akram al-Hakim said he believed the Sunnis deserved "five times" more security support than the rest of the members, but he said he thought the decision to go to a restaurant unguarded was foolish.  Sunni Arab supplemental member Shaykh Muhammad Abed Rabbo al- Jaburi was angry that he and his colleagues have not been given the same Iraqi-government funded security package as the rest of the TNA members -- each of whom is budgeted for 10 guards.  Jaburi and others acknowledged that Mujbil Shaykh Issa traveled unguarded.  One journalist remarked to PolOff that Issa had bragged to her that very afternoon that he could move comfortably among even insurgents in Iraq.  3.  (C) COMMENT: This assassination is unlikely to spark a withdrawal by Sunni Arab delegates -- Jaburi, for example, was cordial and committed even following the incident.  Similarly, we have heard committee member Abdel Nasser al-Janabi reiterate several times that despite threats to his life he would not stop his engagement in the political process.  The killings, however, likely will lead them emphasize the pressure they are under and the limits of their maneuvering room.  4.

DIA IIR 6 847 0115 05      B. DIA IIR 6 847 0125 05  Classified By: Political-Military Affairs Counselor David C. Litt for r  easons 1.4 (b) and (d).  THIS CABLE IS CLASSIFIED SECRET -- NOFORN. NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN NATIONALS.  1. (S//NF) SUMMARY. During a routine office call, National Security Advisor Mouwaffak Al-Rubaie discussed the development of a strategic security alliance with Iran to assist Iraq in combating the Sunni insurgency. Rubaie stated that while more right- wing elements of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) were advocating such a relationship, a more moderate position held sway among principal SCIRI and Dawa leaders who believe that movement too far in this direction would antagonize the U.S. The ITG, however, is considering legislation to establish a new Ministry of Intelligence to replace the Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS) possibly headed by State Minister of National Security Abdul Kareem Al-Anzi, the primary advocate for intelligence sharing with Iran.  Rubaie identified Iran's nuclear program and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC's) support of Hamas and Hizballah to be the principal issues standing in the way of a constructive rapprochement between Iran and the U.S.  He confided that he was aware of IRGC activities in Iraq, calling them a "great danger". Ironically, according to Rubaie, the IRGC credentials of newly elected Iranian President Mahmud Ahmedinejad may afford him the flexibility to make the tough decisions required to overcome the mutual distrust that has characterized the Iran-U.S. relationship since 1979. END SUMMARY  --------------------------------------------- --------- MAINTAINING A PRECARIOUS BALANCE AS JAFARI COURTS IRAN --------------------------------------------- ---------  2. (S//NF) In a conversation on 18 July with Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak Al-Rubaie, POLMILOFF inquired about reports that Prime Minister Ibrahim Al-Jafari and State Minister for National Security Abdul Kareem Al'Anzi were seeking to establish a security alliance and intelligence-sharing agreement with Iran. Rubaie stated that that there was a spectrum of views on this issue within the cadre of UIA advisors to the Prime Minister. At the conservative end of the spectrum, the strongly anti- Ba'athist camps of Ahmad Chalabi, Muqtada Al-Sadr, and the more radical elements of SCIRI are advocating Iranian assistance to defeat the Ba'athist-driven insurgency, even if, as in the case of Al-Sadr, this represents a reversal of an otherwise strongly nationalistic agenda. At its core, their view stems from a frustration with the Coalition's ability to fathom the nature of the Sunni insurgency, and their lack of willingness to take the necessary steps to defeat it.  3. (S//NF) At the other end, typified by more progressive elements of Dawa and other independents, are those voices which consider any relationship with Iran anathema and a threat to harmonious relations with the Coalition. The middle ground is held by SCIRI and Dawa centrists who, while predisposed to develop such a relationship with Iran, are hesitant to risk compromising any good faith thus far developed with the U.S.  Rubaie agreed with POLMILOFF's supposition that this must be a very tenuous line to hold, attempting to appease both Tehran and Washington simultaneously.  -------------------------------- REENGINEERING IRAQI INTELLIGENCE --------------------------------  4. (S//NF) Rubaie confirmed that in addition to these bilateral relationships, the ITG Council of Ministers was deliberating upon proposed legislation to create a new Ministry of Intelligence, reportedly to be anchored around the nucleus of advisors to State Minister for National Security, Al-Anzi.  Politically reliable elements of the existing INIS are to be salvaged and incorporated into this new organization. Rubaie appeared to be in opposition to the idea, believing that though the INIS was compromised by former regime elements and in need of more thorough vetting and organizational restructuring, it did not warrant the creation of a new bureaucracy in favor of an existing one.  5. (S//NF) The Council of Ministers, according to Rubaie, had yet to achieve consensus on the issue, with the Kurds in significant opposition. The issue had been tabled for discussion at the Ministerial Council for National Security (MCNS) meeting scheduled for 21 July.  POLMILOFF suggested that a new organization revolving around Al-Anzi, the premier advocate for close intelligence cooperation with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), may pose challenges for continued intelligence exchange between the Coalition and the ITG. Rubaie conceded that this could be a problem.  ---------------------------- CAN'T WE JUST ALL GET ALONG? ----------------------------  6. (S//NF) Rubaie segued by suggesting that a U.S. rapprochement with Iran would help ameliorate these tensions and serve the mutual interests of Iran and the U.S. in establishing a stable and secure Iraq. He specified Iran's nuclear program and IRGC support for Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas in the Levant as the primary issues of contention for the U.S.  POLMILOFF asked if IRGC activities in Iraq should also be a cause of concern. Rubaie stated that he was aware of IRGC's introduction of advanced IED technology into Iraq, and their substantial financial support to the Badr Organization and other militant political groups which had a stifling effect on the development of other Shia political voices which were not the beneficiaries of Iranian patronage. These activities are nearly impossible to counter, with limited inherent capability (or will) for the ITG to interdict them and the limits of engagement the Coalition has set for itself in promoting political parties. Rubaie called the IRGC a "great danger". (COMMENT. POLMILOFF understood this to mean a general threat to constructive multilateral relations, and not an explicit military threat. END COMMENT).  7. (S//NF) The National Security Advisor made clear, however, that the IRGC did not represent the 'political elites' of Iran, typified by Rafsanjani and Khatami, who are capable of being rational, thoughtful interlocutors with Washington.  When asked whether former IRGC officer and newly-elected president Mahmud Ahmedinejad fit into that category, Rubaie responded with a flourish of rhetorical acrobatics. Citing the Likud party, he stated that politics in Israel are not entirely different from politics in Iran, and just as the conservatives in Israel have been able to make the tough decisions to effect progress, perhaps too, Ahmedinejad's conservative credibility may afford him the flexibility to take the bold steps necessary to overcome the residual psychological baggage of those hardly forgotten 444 days.  8.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 003004  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2015 TAGS: MOPS, PHUM, PINS, PTER, IZ, Detainees, Security SUBJECT: ITG RELUCTANT TO CONSIDER LEGAL DETENTION AUTHORITIES  Classified By: Classified by David C. Litt, Political- Military Affairs Counselor, for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (S) Iraqi participation and input improved at the third USG-ITG meeting to discuss legal authorities for the proposed transition of Coalition detention operations to the Iraqi government. Representatives from the Ministries of Human Rights, Interior, Justice, and Ministry of State for National Security joined TNA member Sharwan al-Waely in a spirited if unfocused discussion on detainee issues.  2.  (S) All Iraqi participants were adamant that no legal authorities for Iraqi security detention exist today, and none showed interest in developing such authorities in the future. Discussion focused instead on the transfer of greater numbers of detainees to the Iraqi court system, and al-Waely's plan to introduce a shadow committee to "help" the Combined Review and Release Board (CRRB), which he views critically.  -------------------- DEFINING THE PROBLEM --------------------  3.  (S) Al-Waely's opening comments indicated he had been receptive to last week's briefing on the profile and threat level of the Coalition detainee population. In reviewing the issue for new members of the group, he accurately explained the roles of the CRRB and the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI), and noted that "both we and the Americans are afraid" of the consequences of releasing many detainees currently in custody.  4.  (S) MoHR Prisons Director Saad Sultan echoed this assessment, telling the group that his extensive contacts with Coalition detainees (Sultan is a regular presence at Abu Ghraib) had convinced him that many were criminals who had committed serious crimes under the previous regime. "If the Iraqi people knew who these people were," he said, "they would come forward and complain against them".  5.  (S) A discussion of the best means by which to identify court-worthy criminals amongst the security internee population ensued, with the MOI representative offering to check detainee names against files in the MOI criminal record department for past offenses, and several Iraqi participants suggesting that detainee names be publicly advertised in order to solicit legal complaints from the Iraqi public about past criminal acts.  6.  (S) (Note: a number of these propositions may prove useful if they come to fruition; the collection of additional information on past criminal acts by detainees could, in theory, assist in the discovery of outstanding warrants. End note.)  ----------------- LEGAL AUTHORITIES -----------------  7.  (S) All Iraqi participants responded with a firm negative to Embassy counsel's inquiry as to whether they believed the Iraqi government currently possessed any rights to impose security detention. "If I find someone who has been in custody longer than twenty-four hours and has not seen a judge," said Sultan, "I tell MOI or MOJ to let him go".  8.  (S) The Director General of the Ministry of National Security did note, as an aside, that in reality he often saw people who had been detained in Iraqi custody "for months" without appearing before a judge, but no one else commented on the issue of current Iraqi extra-judicial detention.  9.  (S) When Embassy counsel raised the disposition of dangerous detainees in Coalition custody against whom - for reasons of witness intimidation, sensitive intelligence, or other causes - court cases could not be brought, the group was unmoved. "If you have a case where you have no source, no evidence, no crime, no case, that person should be released," said Raad Alim, representing the Ministry of Justice.   -------------------- CHANGING THE SUBJECT --------------------  10.  (S) Pol-MilOff raised a hypothetical scenario, asking whether the in future, Iraqi Security Forces in the midst of a five-day fight against insurgents in an enemy-occupied town would be expected to choose between bringing a judge into the midst of the fighting to mount investigative hearings or releasing disarmed fighters twenty-four hours after their capture, into a live battle.  11.  (S) Al-Waely ignored the scenario and quickly changed the subject. "Let us talk about a practical proposal", he said, outlining a plan to form another committee - and several sub-committees - to "extend" the work of the CRRB, which reviews detainee files and recommends release or continued detention. (Note: al-Waely has previously been vocal in his opinion that the CRRB recommends insufficient numbers of detainees for release.)  12. (Note: One Iraqi idea - to have the CRRB's Iraqi participants examine detainee files closely for missed evidence of relevant criminal offenses, given their greater familiarity with Iraqi idiom and law - was clearly productive, although already in practice at the CRRB.)  12.  (S) An animated discussion followed among the Iraqi participants as to the proposed committee's scope. It is not clear that consensus was reached - the MOI representative proposed that detainee names be checked against criminal records, MoHR was intent upon publishing names to attract witnesses, and al-Waely announced that lists would be screened for former regime figures and "names that are innocent".  13.  (S) Embassy counsel proposed at the close of the meeting that we return next week to the subject of Iraqi legal detention authorities for  security detention; the Iraqi participants agreed politely, and said that they would also update Embassy and MNF-I representatives of the formation and progress of the new (and as yet unnamed) committee.  ------- COMMENT -------  14.  (S) Our Iraqi interlocutors are enthusiastic about increasing the proportion of detainees funneled into the criminal justice system, which they blame for a perceived backlog in prosecutions. (Enthusiasm for adequately funding and securing the court is less apparent.) Many of their proposals are practical and positive, and these will be developed as a priority.  15.  (S) Our partners show little interest, however, in the consequences for internal Iraqi security of releasing large numbers of detainees who the Iraqi- majority CRRB has judged pose an imperative threat to security, but who the Iraqi courts are unable to charge. We will discuss these security concerns in detail next week, with a focus on real-word examples illustrating the gravity of the problem, but note that this disengagement is common across the ITG.  16.  (S) Should al-Waely's conception of the newly- formed committee prevail, we expect it will function as a source of detainee release requests rather than a forum for discussion of legal and political issues raised by the proposed transfer of Coalition detention operations.  We will need to monitor carefully its interaction with and influence on the current CRRB. Satterfield

(S/NF) MNF-I and Embassy are receiving frequent and fervent requests from Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja'afari, Minister of State for National Security Abd al-Karim al-Anzi, and National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie for the release of detainee Mehdi Abdmehd al-Khalisi (MP#124), currently held by MNF-I at Camp Cropper, near Baghdad International Airport.  2.  (S/NF) Al-Anzi has told Embassy contacts that Mr. al-Khalisi is a close personal friend of his, Mr. Rubaie's, and the PM's. He has also said that Mr. al-Khalisi is innocent of any offense, and that al-Anzi would be happy to face a judge in his place. (Mr. al-Khalisi, who was detained on July 17, 2003, is being investigated and is likely to face eventual criminal charges in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq.)  3.  (S/NF) Mr. al-Khalisi, an Iraqi national who lived in Iran for twenty-three years, returned to Iraq in 2003 to open an Islamic Cultural Office, which produced a weekly anti-Coalition newspaper.  He is believed to be the founder and leader of the Iranian- backed Muntada al-Wilaya (MAW), which carried out the assassination of Ba'ath Party leaders.  4.  (S/NF) A source within MAW claims to have seen an enciphered telegram from Mr. al-Khalisi to Brigadier Ahmed Fourauzandeh, the deputy commander of Ramazan Command in the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Group, in which Mr. al-Khalisi claims responsibility for an attack against six British military police officers in am-Mijar al-Kabir in June 2003.  5.  (S/NF) Another MAW source of unknown reliability claims that that Brigadier Fourauzandeh has authorized an expenditure of up to $500,000 for operations to secure Mr. al-Khalisi's release, and that senior ITG officials have received telephone calls from the Brigadier requesting assistance.  6.  (S/NF) MNF-I has already informed ITG leadership, including the PM, that Mr. al-Khalisi poses a significant security threat and faces serious criminal charges; MNF-I is also preparing a declassified summary of the information above which can be passed to the PM, Mr. al-Anzi, and Mr. Rubaie.  Whether this will quiet calls for his release remains to be seen. Satterfield 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BAGHDAD 003007  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/20/2025 TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, IZ, Sunni Arab, National Assembly SUBJECT: SUNNI CONSTITUTION DRAFTERS COMMITTED TO AUGUST 15 DEADLINE: THE BIG ISSUE IS FEDERALISM  REF: BAGHDAD 3000  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires David Satterfield. Reasons 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY: Two principal members of the newly appointed members to the Constitutional Committee told us July 18 that they are committed to finishing a draft by August 15 if possible but they are opposed to a federalist vision of Iraq.  An influential member (who was subsequently murdered on July 19) of the 15- member Sunni negotiating team has suggested either decentralizing authority to the provinces.  Another tactic that all Sunnis agree on is delaying resolution of the most contentious questions until the convening of the next assembly after December's elections.  We are urging them to stay in the game (which may prove difficult; both an UN advisor and representative of the Sunni Waqf report the Sunni drafters will withdraw from the committee), continue to promote solutions to ensure the unity of Iraq and seek compromise on the type of federalism all parties can live with.  It appears unlikely that the Kurds will negotiate their existing regional government authorities.  The Shia are unlikely to accept regional Shia conglomerations having fewer authorities than the Kurds already enjoy. In this situation, it will be easier for the Kurds and Shia to repeat the experience of last spring's cabinet formation and make a separate deal and then presenting a fait-accompli to the more rigid Sunni Arabs.  We will continue our efforts to convince the Sunni Arabs that federalism would be a vehicle to protect their interests.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- Sunnis Lay Out Dispute with Federalist Vision ---------------------------------------------  2.  (C) Sunni supplemental member of the Constitutional Drafting Committee, Mujbil Ali Haseen al Shaykh Issa told PolCouns on July 18 (prior to his assassination) that the Kurds were pushing their version of federalism for the south.  He appeared resolutely opposed to language allowing any provinces to form a regional government aka the KRG model.  He laid out two key reasons.  First, he said that regions that control security, court systems and all economic policy would have the attributes of states and sooner or later would succeed from Iraq.  They would also be subject to greater influence from outside powers. Shaykh Issa postulated the Shi'ite citizenry was not even in favor of this interpretation of federalism. Al Issa accused the Kurds of pursuing 'confederalism' rather than 'federalism' and described their demands as 'asking for the moon'.  3.  (C) PolCouns countered that the international community supported the vision of a federal Iraqi state in UNSCR 1546.  There would be no going back to the old style of the Iraqi state.  He asked Shaykh Issa if it would be really better for residents of Anbar or Ninewa to have governors appointed by a (likely) Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, for example.  Shaykh Issa said he approved the concept of decentralization, but not federalism.  Administrative authorities, such as management of electricity, water, roads and health could be left to provincial or even regional authorities.  Political authorities, such as the power to legislate or to manage the judicial system, had to be left to the central government. Shaykh Issa claimed that left alone to legislate every province in southern Iraq, and most of the Sunni provinces as well, would become entirely religious governments.  If an issue like social policy were left to these governments, in the southern provinces "it'd be like under the Taliban - you wouldn't see a woman's face".  In addition, he feared the Sunni Arabs would be left with little revenue.  He welcomed PolCouns' note that the U.S. was urging ownership of natural resource revenues remain with the national government. PolCouns added that strong constitutional protections of individual and community rights could minimize the problem of extremists' dominating local politics. Shaykh Issa shot back that Iraq has no history of respecting rule of law, and the Sunni Arabs' current experience is not encouraging.  4.  (C) Shaykh Issa said that if the Shia and Kurds want governorates to have legislative and judicial powers, the Sunni Arabs would agree as long as governorates are not allowed to join into regions. This way they would not be tempted to break away into independent states.  5.  (C) The Iraqi Islamic Party's Dr. Ayad Samarra'i, also a member of the 15 person Sunni team, asserted to Poloff July 18 that the southern Shi'ites were being manipulated by 'others' into forming a Southern Regional Government amid conditions that were not 'permissive'.  (Comment: Samarra'i was most likely pointing to pro-Iranian political parties.  End Comment.)  Samarra'i further stipulated that the formation of any regional government should be subject to a national (rather than regional) referendum. Also, there should be a clause allowing provinces that become disenchanted with their regional bloc to secede.  6. (C) Samarra'i cautioned he was not opposed to future regionalization in principle.  Should, for example, Maysan and Basra one-day wish to join that would be 'an administrative question' for the National Assembly.  Nonetheless, at this stage it is simply too dangerous to the unity of the nation.  He noted ethnic/sectarian tensions and/or intimidation is already leading to the displacement of ethnic or sectarian minorities.  The application of further regionalization, based on 'geographic' or ethnic basis, e.g. could fuel the flight of Sunnis from Basra.  The formation of a Southern Regional Government, consisting of either a minimum of three to a maximum of all of the nine Shi'ite provinces would lead to a similar (reactive) Sunni initiative.  The de facto result would be three states: Shia, Sunni and Kurdish.  He also observed a nine-province Southern Regional Government (an idea he claimed was supported by Ayatollah Sistani) would exert too much influence on the central government.  ------------------------------ Moving Forward, Sunni Endgame? ------------------------------  7.  (C) Shaykh Issa told us that the border issue was exceptionally sensitive.  He had seen the Kurdish map mentioned in ref A and scoffed at its seriousness.  A resident of Kirkuk himself, he said Kirkuk should be addressed later and outside the constitution, including the tough issue of Kirkuk's borders.  His conclusion was that the toughest issues in general should be postponed until after the December 2005 elections.  8.  (C) Samarra'i noted the individual members (from all factions) of Constitutional Drafting committee had clearly established their ideological positions over a week beforehand.  Now -- for the last three days -- drafters were simply reiterating their stances.  He advocated getting down to the business of drafting the text and then turn over the issues that are unresolved to their political party leaders.  While he noted, "a bad constitution (by August 15) was better than no constitution", he indicated the Sunnis do have a contingency plan if they are dissatisfied with the final draft.  Observing "that many" may change their position during the two month period for discussion (August 15 - October 15), Samarra'i said the Sunni Arabs would use this period to poll their constituents, consult internally and then make a decision whether to urge their supporters to vote for or against.   He refuted the possibility of a Sunni walk-out from the drafting process, but left open the possibility that if the Sunni Arab politicos cannot convince their constituents that the document was the best compromise possible -- and that it was superior to the Transitional Administrative Law -- they'd oppose the passage of the referendum.  ------------------- Other Problem Areas -------------------  9.  (C) Shaykh Issa listed several other points of contention.  He thought they could be resolved, but there is no immediate resolution in sight.  These include  -- whether to call the country the Republic or Federal Republic of Iraq;  --  how to handle the issue of the Arab identity of Iraq;  --  whether to allow dual nationality (the Sunnis oppose);  --  whether Kurdish should be a national language with Arabic;  10.  (C) COMMENT:  Samarra'i, his usual dour, but sharp-witted self was nervous about the course of negotiations; he was dubious that an agreement suitable to the Sunni Arabs could be found.  Shaykh Issa was less visibly downbeat.  He displayed ideological rigidity, but his recognition of decentralization may leave some room to negotiate up. The problem is that the Kurds won't negotiate down, and the Shia are unlikely to accept regional Shia conglomerations having fewer authorities than the Kurds already enjoy.  In this situation, it will be easier for the Kurds and Shia to repeat the experience of last spring's cabinet formation and make a separate deal and then present a fait-accompli to the more rigid Sunni Arabs.  It is hard to see how the Sunni Arabs would in turn accept such a negotiating tactic and return to their own bases and try to sell the Shia/Kurdish position.  We will continue to explain to the Sunni Arab community how federalism will protect their interests and urge the Interior Ministry to start addressing the allegations of human rights abuses that lie just beneath the surface of almost any conversation we have with Sunni Arabs now.  11.  (C) COMMENT/BIO CONTINUED.  Mujbil Ali Haseen al Shaykh Issa was born July 1, 1957 and maintained a home in his native village (and insurgent stronghold) Hawija as well as in Kirkuk.  He was assassinated on July 19.  (Ref A)  He said he once served at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  He noted that he, with Dhamin Hasan Aleiwi (a member of the Sunni Constitutional 'expert' committee, assassinated alongside Shaykh Issa) and an Akhmet Horshi started the Kirkuk University's faculty of law.  He said shortly after the arrival of the CF the Kurds passed false information to the American military leading to his detention.  He was released after one week.  He also served as legal council to several Amman-based international firms and claimed an income of 10-15,000 USD per month.  He said his name was proposed as a candidate for the Governing Council and Iraqi Interim Government Minister of Industry and Minerals.  We heard his name mentioned a possible minister during the messy government formation in May.  As with his nomination to the Constitution Committee there was significant Kurdish opposition to his candidacy.  He admitted, smiling, they classified him as 'anti- federalist'.  Issa said he'd recently formed a political party called al Qarar, the 'Decision,' with fellow National Dialog member, Professor D. Nabeal M.S. Younis (of International Relations and Public Policies, Baghdad University.)  Issa reported he was single and was a blog afficiando, honing his English through chatting.  He, in the consistent manner of most Sunni politicos, ridiculed his colleagues.  He mentioned if Hatem Mukhlis tried to hitchhike in his hometown of Tikrit, no one would pick him up (he's so little known).  Extremely tall (approximately 6'5") and fashionably dressed, Issa confessed his profound indignity of incarceration with common criminals by the Americans.  Nonetheless, he energetically urged we 'rebuild' the bridges between the Sunnis and the USG, and offered to serve as a facilitator with new influential and legitimate representatives of the minority.  Outwardly secular and liberal, his death may lead to shift toward the hard-line element in the nascent Sunni leadership.  Already, (Ref A) the two moderate Sunnis who left the committee were replaced by conservative ideologues with likely strong ties to the insurgency.  12.  (C) COMMENT/BIO CONTINUED.  Shaykh Muhammad Tahir al-Abid Rabbo al-Jaburi, another added Sunni Arab member of the Constitution Drafting Committee was born in 1956 in Mosul and is a leading shaykh of the Jaburi tribe.  He holds a law degree and is currently enrolled as a student at the Sharia Academy in Mosul. He served as an officer in the Iraqi Army for over a decade before being arrested in 1996 on charges of plotting a coup.  Jaburi acknowledges now that the charges were true, but says the plan never came close to fruition.  Jaburi says he adamantly refused for years to put a picture of Saddam Husayn in his home, a small rebellion seen as suspicious at the time, and he let his Ba'ath Party membership lapse in 1993 after joining in a pro forma fashion.  After the charge of treason, he was sent to one of the Ba'athist state's most notorious prisons, al-Hakimiyya, which he claims makes the feared "Palace of the End" prison seem "like tourism."  Jaburi spent about 6 months in prison before using connections to the prison warden to secure his release.  He returned to Mosul and decided to run for the "People's Assembly," the former Saddam- era parliament, in 2000.  Jaburi says Revolutionary Council Deputy Chairman Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri saw his candidacy and the popular support he was drawing as a threat and saw to it that Jaburi's name was pulled off the ballot.  By that point, Jaburi said, he had come to the conviction that Saddam Husayn needed to go "even if Satan himself came to replace him."  It was in that spirit that he welcomed U.S. forces to Mosul in 2003 and served on the first city government in May, 2003.  Jaburi also holds a degree in engineering but appears to derive his income from his assets and influence as a tribal leader in Mosul.  He prides himself on his independence and is considering running in the next elections on a slate with other leaders without formally joining any political party.  A self- professed lover of women, he is married with four wives and claimed to be single while chatting up a female Rashid Hotel employee after a recent meeting with PolOff.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY: The major themes in the daily newspapers on July 20 were the constitutional committee's preparations for the referendum and drafting the constitution, and the latest developments of the security situation. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS -----------------  A. "Clarity in London and ambiguity in Baghdad" (Al-Bayyan, 7/20) B. "Wrong message" (Al-Fourat, 7/20)  ---------------------- SELECTED COMMENTARIES ----------------------  A. "Clarity in London and ambiguity in Baghdad" (7/20)  Al-Bayyan (affiliated with Islamic Ad-Da'wa Party led by Ibrahim Al-Jafari) published a third-page editorial by Salim Rasool about Muslim scholars' attitude toward terrorist operations in London and Baghdad:  "Muslim scholars from different sects in London have signed a statement in which they condemned the recent terrorist operation.  The scholars regard the perpetrators of those attacks as criminals who do not belong in Islam. Most Muslim's agree that the terrorists have distorted Islam by conducting such deeds.  However, the scholar's public declaration has a deeper meaning as well.  It is an indication of how the London Muslim community was also a victim of the London bombings.  Western extremists now accuse every Muslim of being a terrorist and the London Muslim community is under attack from these people.  It was not the terrorist activities that convinced the Muslim scholars to issue their statement but rather the negative consequences to the Muslim community in England.  According to the scholars, these actions committed in the name of Islam are criminal in London, but not, it seems, in Baghdad.  Why hasn't the entire Muslim world come out against terrorist activities in Iraq?  Why aren't there any statements from Muslim scholars condemning the bombings and the beheadings?  The situation in Iraq requires those scholars to announce their attitude against terrorism and bloodshed in Iraq. Some senior scholars like the Al-Azhar Mosque sheikh and the Saudi mufti condemned terrorism in Iraq. However, since those statements came from individuals they accomplished nothing.  If all Muslim scholars spoke out in a united voice against terrorism, terrorists would not be able to recruit any more Muslims to fight in Iraq. Recently at a conference held in Amman, none of the many Islamic figures in attendance spoke the truth about terrorism.  None of them condemned the terrorist spreading death in Iraq.  The Iraqi people wish that all Muslims would unite against the Iraqi bloodshed.  Terrorism operations in Iraq are committed in the name of resistance however Iraqis are dying in vain and the terrorist are criminals.  The Iraqi Muslim people want the senior Muslim scholars to answer one question.  Why do they clearly condemn the London bombings while maintaining an ambiguous attitude concerning terrorism in Iraq?"  B. "Wrong message" (7/20)  Al-Fourat (independent, anti coalition) published a second- page editorial by Majed Fadhel Al-Zuboon about the constitution:  "We hear many opinions these days about the Iraqi constitution from Iraqi politicians and the general population in Iraq.  We hear that it is supposed to be ratified by the Iraqi people through a referendum.  We hear that there are many different groups trying to work together and that there are many different opinions as to what the document it should look like.  The Iraqi people seem to be resolved to actively participate in the constitutional process despite the difficulties involved.  Their participation is important because the constitution will be the blueprint for the future of Iraq.  It will determine both the national and foreign policies of Iraq for a long while to come.  Indeed, this process requires local media outlets to educate the people about how to make the constitutional process a success.  By focusing on sectarianism and power sharing, I think that the former Governing Council, which was directly supervised by civil administrator Paul Bremer, gave Iraqis the wrong message.  The experiment of the Governing Council has created sectarianism and sectarianism will lead to a separated Iraq. The right to establishing federal territories in Iraq can only be ratified by the Iraqi people. I think that the world will soon learn that the Iraqis do not want their country to be split up into sections.  They want a united Iraq.  Regarding the national assembly, we believe that that each province must have its own representation.  The government must not be organized according to electoral lists. This process will move us away from sectarianism and ethic power sharing.  The seeds of these evils were planted by Bremer and has led to our current situation of suffering and pain."  SATTERFIELD

FEINBERG-PILZ EMAIL JULY 13      B. SILKWORTH-PILZ EMAIL JULY 13      C. FEINBERG-PILZ INTERVIEW JULY 19  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S) Summary and Action Request. This cable seeks concurrence as to the legal disposition of Iraqi- American national Mohammed Munaf (or Muneef), now held as a security internee by Coalition Forces in Iraq under the authority of UNSCR 1546. (Background: Munaf, a former resident of Romania, was detained in May 2005 due to his suspected involvement in a kidnapping plot involving Romanian journalists.)  2.  (S) On July 18, an Article V panel convened by MNF-I found Mohammed Munaf has the legal status of "security internee"; this fact will soon be formally reported to OSD.  We understand that DoD intends to proceed now with interagency discussions on Munaf's disposition on the basis of informal reporting.  3.  (S) It is DoD policy as pertains to security internees in USG custody in Iraq that the intent of the USG to bring charges against an internee be considered first among parties likely to bring such charges.  Should the USG lack evidence on which to proceed, the ability and willingness of the Iraqi courts to try the internee will be considered next.  3.  (S) Post has not received notification of USG interest in prosecuting Munaf. However, the Central Criminal Court of Iraq has requested his appearance as a witness and as a defendant. Post and MNF-I recommend that the established procedures with respect to American citizens held as MNF-I security internees be followed should the USG opt not to initiate legal proceedings against Munaf. Post and MNF-I further recommend that:  (a) the CCCI be allowed to call Munaf as a witness on the understanding that he will remain in MNF-I's legal and physical custody during and after his court appearance;  (b) the CCCI be subsequently allowed to try Munaf as a defendant (a decision that would transfer legal custody of Munaf to Iraq); and  (c) that physical custody of Munaf be transferred to the Iraqi Ministry of Justice should he be convicted and given a custodial sentence.  4. (S) As noted in reftels, the Government of Romania has requested that MNF-I make Munaf available for a judicial hearing on "Romanian legal territory" at the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad.  We understand that a second request was made recently that Munaf be interviewed by Romanian prosecutors at his place of detention.  5.  (S) MNF-I does not object to Romanian access to Munaf if it takes place at the detention site, is investigatory in nature, and does not prevent the USG or the CCCI (should Embassy Baghdad and MNF-I's recommendation be adopted) from proceeding with Munaf's prosecution.  6.  (S) We recommend that the USG respect the intent of an Iraqi court to try an Iraqi-American national for crimes committed inside Iraq and that this issue be given priority.  The issues of Romanian extradition or assumption of custody should be handled bilaterally between Iraq and Romania. The Embassy will be pleased to facilitate these bilateral contacts.  -------------- ACTION REQUEST --------------  7.  (S) Given the urgency of the Iraqi and Romanian governments' requests, we request the Department's guidance on this matter as soon as possible. Satterfield

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Following the July 19 assassinations of Sunni representatives to the Constitution Drafting bodies, the media has reported that the entire Sunni contingent had withdrawn from the constitution drafting process.  While there is some confusion even amongst our Iraqi interlocutors as to whether this is the case, it appears that Sunni participation in the constitution development process has been only temporarily suspended and Committee members are taking time to mourn their slain colleagues.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Angry and grief stricken Sunnis openly contemplated withdrawal from the constitution development process at the July 20 session of the Transitional National Assembly. Deputy Constitution Committee Chair and head of the Sunni delegation Adnan al-Janabi demanded guards and a security budget for Sunni representatives to the Committee that is on par with that provided to other TNA members.  In a side meeting during today's session, Speaker Hajim al-Hassani and Qassim Daoud agreed to provide the Sunnis with 15 guards -- the number allotted to other TNA members -- and a budget for the purchase of an appropriate vehicle.  3. (C) Al-Janabi exchanged heated words with al-Hassani both inside and outside the July 20 session, complaining that the condolence statement read during the Assembly by Daoud, who has essentially broken with the Iraqiya bloc, was inappropriate.  Daoud described Mujbil Ali Haseen al Shaykh Issa as a member of the Dulaimi tribe rather than the Nuami tribe.  Additionally, al-Janabi felt he should have read the statement, not Daoud.  4. (C) The National Dialogue's Dr. Saleh Mutlak expressed his anger at the refusal of the TNA to support the new -- and threatened -- Sunni members to the Constitution Committee. He said TNA authorities had delayed even badging the new members and had not made any moves to support their personal security.  He also stated that the Karada neighborhood where Mujbil Issa and others were killed is well patrolled by Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), who did nothing to protect his colleagues.  5. (C) Both al-Janabi and Mutlak told reporters that they are suspending Sunni participation on the Constitution Committee, and today's meeting was cancelled.  It remains unclear, however, whether the suspension is because the Sunnis were attending today's funeral for the slain Committee members or a step out the door entirely.  6. (C) Dr. Hasib Saleh al Obeidi told PolOff while traveling north to the slain committee members' village of Hawija that he and several other committee members (most likely other National Dialogue representatives) would be in mourning for two days and did not intend to return to Baghdad before that time.  Obeidi said there had not yet been any decision to withdraw but predicted National Dialogue members would come to some consensus on how to proceed.  7. (C) Dr. Ala'a Sadoun, an Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) representative to the Committee, said the group did not attend today's TNA meeting, but was considering attending on July 21.  IIP's Dr. Ayad Samarra'i also did not mention to PolOff any planned withdrawal.  ------- COMMENT -------  8. (C) It is far from clear whether the Sunnis do, in fact, intend to withdraw from the constitution process permanently, despite press reports that this is already a 'fait accompli.'  An encouraging sign is that Sunni interlocutors have indicated they will go forward with a meeting planned for this evening with the Charge.  Post will press Sunni leaders hard to continue participation in the constitution drafting process.  Post will also strongly urge the Government, as PolCouns did today in a discussion with Prime Minister Jafari, to provide adequate security --at least on par with that provided to other TNA members -- to the Sunni members of the Constitution Committee.  END COMMENT.  9. (U) REO HILLA, REO BASRA, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered. Satterfield

E.O. 12958 DECL: N/A TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, IZ, KWM SUBJECT: WOMEN DEMONSTRATE AGAINST DRAFT CONSTITUTION PROVISIONS ON EQUALITY AND PERSONAL RIGHTS  1.  (U) PolFSN witnessed a sit-in demonstration on July 19 that was organized and sponsored by the Iraqi Women's Net. (NOTE: The Iraqi Women's Net is a network of more than 75 women's non-governmental organizations (NGO).  END NOTE.) The sit-in took place in a tent overlooking the Sheraton and Meridian hotels at Firdous Square in Baghdad's city center.  The aim of the sit-in demonstration was to protest several articles proposed for inclusion in the draft constitution.  (NOTE: There is still no "final text" of a draft constitution, but debate on what should be included continues.  END NOTE.)  2.  (U) More than 30 NGOs and approximately 150 women from all over Iraq attended the sit-in.  Participants included the Iraqi Women's Net, Al Amal, Women for Peace, Iraqi Women's League, Baghdad Women's Association, Faili Kurd Women's Union, Sara Organization, Communist Party, Iraqi Women's Freedom Organization, and the Chaldo-Assyrian Women's Union.  3.  (U) The sit-in focused on several aspects of a proposed draft constitution that has been provided to and disseminated by the press and NGOs, as well as Constitution Committee and National Assembly members. The women raised specific issues during this event, including the question of nationality, equal and guaranteed rights for women as mothers, workers, and citizens, the prevention of violence against women, and the quota system.  4.  (U) The women demanded that the constitution drafting deadline be extended, rejected the reactivation of Proposition 137 (septel), and lobbied for a quota for female representation of not less than 40 percent in all decision-making positions.  They also rejected any time limitations on this quota requirement.  Additionally, the group said it wants international human rights standards and agreements as a source for Iraqi legislation.  5.  (U) Both local and international media covered the event.  Among those present were Al Hurra TV, Sawa Radio, Associated Press, Turkish TV, BBC, CNN, French TV, "New York Times," Reuters, Iraqiya TV, Fayha'a TV, and Sumariya TV.  Numerous representatives of women's organizations spoke to the media, including Hana'a Edwar (Al Amal), Shirooq Hussain (Tareeq Al Sha'ab newspaper), Bashaier Khalil (Iraqi Women's League), and Shatha Naji (Women for Peace).  6.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The women attending the sit-in strike represented the spectrum of Iraq's ethnic and religious diversity.  Their message was translated into a series of recommendations that was submitted to the Constitution Committee.  However, there are many Islamic women who support a more prominent role for Shari'a in the draft constitution.  According to the media, these women held a counter-protest to the Firdous Square event.  Throughout the constitution drafting process and in the run-up to the referendum, it is important for women to continue to organize and participate in similar efforts to ensure that they have a voice in the political process.  END COMMENT.

QSCID IIR 6 110 0055 05  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   1.  (S//NF) Summary. Despite the relative spirit of democratic cooperation demonstrated by the Shia parties that dominate the governing coalition in Iraq, some of these parties and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps - Qods Force (IRGC-QF), Iran's vanguard political and unconventional warfare organization, are waging a multi-dimensional campaign to shape the geopolitical dynamic in central and southern Iraq. The operational thrusts of this campaign are to support financially the dominance of pro-Iranian Shia political parties at the national and provincial levels; consolidate the authority of the Badr militia over the security environment in specific regions of interest;  promote an extreme Shia-Islamic social order in the southernmost provinces using intimidation and violence if necessary; and develop the capability to disrupt, through force of arms, the ability for Coalition Forces to master the security situation.  As the Sunni insurgency, responsible for the preponderance of kinetic attacks, commands the attention of the Coalition, the Shia-dominated regions appear deceptively tranquil. But beneath this relative calm, benign surface, exists a dark undercurrent of aggressive IRGC activity detrimental to U.S. interests. Steps should continue to be taken to mitigate IRGC activity in order to establish democracy in Iraq on firmer ground. End Summary.  ------------------------------------ A KINDER, GENTLER ISLAMIC REVOLUTION ------------------------------------  2.  (S//NF) The United Iraqi Alliance's (UIA) electoral success and the formation of the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) have given rise to significant anxiety about possible Iranian-backed Shia-Islamist influence in the government, particularly in the security services. Thus far, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) has tempered the revolutionary agenda and proved accommodating in both its political rhetoric and actions within the ITG. For example, as anticipated in previous reporting (REFTEL BAGHDAD 1403), at the national level, the SCIRI, and more generally the UIA, has eschewed radical moves within the security services.  Minister of Interior Bayan Jabr, a SCIRI party member with reportedly strong associations to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), has conducted himself like a dedicated, professional technocrat. Though accusations have been leveled at him for purging Sunni officials from the ministry, it can be argued that these actions served to streamline the institution rather than effect any sectarian vendetta (REFTEL BAGHDAD 2376). Similar restraint has been demonstrated in the Ministry of Defense. (NOTE. In what may be a reversal of this well-modulated trend, the ITG is now reported to be exploring close, cooperative relationships with the MOIS and planning to transform the office of the State Ministry of National Security into a new Ministry. Patterned after the MOIS, it would supplant the existing Iraqi National Intelligence Service, viewed by the ITG as politically unreliable. REFTEL BAGHDAD 3001. END NOTE.)  (REF. A, B)  3.  (S//NF) On the broader political front, SCIRI politicians have openly disavowed the Iranian model of the Islamic jurisprudent, 'velayat e-faqih,' as a model for Iraq and at present espouse progressive democratic ideals sonorous to the ears of Western diplomats (REFTEL 0312). Whether or not this represents a genuine political reengineering of SCIRI's Islamic revolutionary foundation or is a well-orchestrated show of expediency, it appears to originate from within the party rather than through the invisible hand of Tehran. That SCIRI's policy decisions are motivated more by an internal political calculus (and not by a foreign agenda which may or may not be convergent) suggests progress in Iraq's democratic consolidation.  4. (S//NF)  Despite SCIRI's cooperative disposition, its financial sponsorship by the IRGC-QF and other Iranian sources has markedly degenerative consequences for the process of democratization. In 2005, Iranian sources, including the IRGC-QF, reportedly supported SCIRI and its affiliates with approximately $100 million; $45 million was specifically allocated to its militia arm, the Badr Corps, which recast itself as a political party, the Badr Organization, for participation in the January elections. (COMMENT. This report will use the term 'Badr militia'. END COMMENT.) The economic horsepower that SCIRI and its alliance partners wield has effectively squelched more liberal, secular voices within the Shia constituency. Shia moderate politicians hoping to achieve some level of political participation are now faced with the choice of either compromising their ideals and allying themselves with Iranian-backed parties or simply watching developments from the sidelines (REFTEL BAGHDAD 2805). As SCIRI and its partners "play the game" in line with U.S. interests, unchecked IRGC-QF and other Iranian patronage ensures that the Shia political spectrum is conclusively dominated by political parties that are at least sympathetic, if not entirely beholden, to their financial benefactors. (REF. A, C, D)  --------------------------------------------- ----- CHANGING OF THE GUARD - BADR SECURES THE PROVINCES --------------------------------------------- -----  5.  (S//NF) In contrast to the relative calm at the national-level, trouble has been brewing in the provinces. Almost immediately after their electoral victories, the new SCIRI-dominated Provincial Councils moved to replace non-partisan police chiefs in the region extending from the Iranian border west through Wasit and Qadisiyah provinces to the holy city of Najaf.  This occurred with relative efficiency in Qadisiyah, while in Najaf the governor used Badr militia forces to install forcibly the favored replacement (who was then killed, ironically enough, in the associated gunfight; the deputy governor, a senior Badr militia officer, later assumed the role of police chief)(REFTEL BAGHDAD 1463). A tense situation remains in Wasit where the police chief, despite consistent maneuvers by the SCIRI-led provincial council to oust him,  is standing firm and refusing to vacate his post bolstered by a loyal and formidable special police unit. While some degree of legal ambiguity exists in such cases regarding the respective authorities of the Provincial Councils (PCs) and the central MOI under CPA Order 71, the prevailing opinion is that the PCs (and to an extent the MOI) have transgressed the spirit of the existing legislation (REFTEL BAGHDAD 2210). In general, the overriding tone of the SCIRI-dominated PCs in South-Central Iraq is one of defiant independence, and moves to entrench Badr militia stalwarts into the local security services have been scarcely concealed. (REF. E, F, G)  6.  (S//NF) Beneath these maneuvers, which at least assume a thin mantle of legitimacy, run efforts to expand the non-official security role of the Badr militia, initially conceived by the Iranians as an adjunct to the IRGC-QF Ramazan Corps (responsible for unconventional warfare operations in Iraq) and now designated as an independent paramilitary organization within the IRGC-QF structure. Collateral reporting indicates that SCIRI has sanctioned the use of vehicular Badr militia patrols and checkpoints throughout Baghdad to provide security in Shia majority areas.  Moreover, Al-Hakim has reportedly encouraged the provincial leadership to utilize the Badr militia network to facilitate more effective security operations and security-related information sharing across provincial jurisdictions, an aspect where local police forces are notoriously weak. (REF. H, I, J)  7. (S//NF) The provincial governor in Najaf, in a probable expansion of this trend, has inaugurated an ad-hoc 'special police force' composed primarily of Badr militia personnel. Also exploring militia-based security options, Minister of State for National Security Abdul Kareem Al An'zi, a member of the conservative Shia party Dawa-Tanzim, has chartered a concept paper for the development of an 'armed neighborhood watch' composed of private citizens responsible for security and information gathering in their local communities who would report to a secret police officer assigned to a community-level area of responsibility. U.S. IRMO advisors report that Interior Minister Bayan Jabr has proposed similar mechanisms to enhance local security. On the one hand, these could be considered reasonable actions in Iraq's volatile and deadly environment. However, these deviations from a developing rule -of law could possibly be more alarming given the financial sponsorship and likely operational direction of the Badr militia by the IRGC-QF. (COMMENT: Post is monitoring SCIRI/Badr-dominated security forces to determine if they are constraining legitimate political activity. So far, this has not been detected on a serious scale. END COMMENT.) (REF. J, K, L)  ------------------- MISSISSIPPI BURNING -------------------  8.  (S//NF) A different dynamic operates in the steamy wetlands of the southern Tigris-Euphrates Valley, where Iranian supported groups like Sayyid Al-Shuhadah, Tha'rallah, and 15 Sha'aban cultivate their passionate Islamist agenda. Here, SCIRI does not categorically dominate. Amidst a virulently anti-Ba'athist climate, the IRGC-QF surrogates vie for political authority against more nationalist Shia political parties such as Al-Fadillah and the Islamic Action Party. (COMMENT. Al-Fadillah took the Basra governorship from SCIRI in the recent elections, demonstrating that there are other Shia Islamist alternatives that can compete. SCIRI's association with Iran led many to vote against the groups supported by Iran. END COMMENT) The machinations of SCIRI and Badr to obtain influence are a comparatively well-tempered sideshow to the back-alley violence and intimidation wielded by the IRGC's more aggressive proxies.  9. (S//NF) The genesis of these groups is not altogether clear. Reporting suggests that Sayyid Al-Shuhadah (Lord of the Martyrs), was formed by a nucleus of Badr intelligence operatives in the early 1990s and remained in relative obscurity until the U.S. invasion. Either as a splinter group of Sayyid Al-Shuhadah or with their organizational support, Tha'rallah (Revenge of God) was later conceived, developing their own uniquely radical character. 15 Sha'aban, named after the inaugural day of the 1991 uprising, also emerged in the early 1990s later to surface as a political group after the fall of Saddam. Despite their hazy origins, these organizations all share some basic characteristics: a popular center of gravity in Basra with additional support bases in the southern cities of Al-Amarah and Nasiriyah, nominal cover as legitimate political organizations, an extreme Shia Islamist agenda, a history of patronage from the IRGC-QF, and a track record of militant activity since the arrival of Coalition Forces. (REF. M, N, O, P,)  10.  (S//NF) Though remaining largely in the shadows, Sayyid Al-Shuhadah, has been widely reported to facilitate the transfer of weapons and munitions across the Iranian border into Iraq and to provide fiscal and logistical support to more violently inclined groups such as Tha'rallah. Recent collateral reporting suggests they may be abetting efforts to assassinate political opponents targeted by IRGC, though their principal overt activities revolve around the development of Islamist student or cultural centers in Basra. Under the fiery leadership of Sayyid Yousif Al Musawi, Tha'rallah, renowned in the streets of Basra for its thuggery and demagoguery, generated public attention with the armed, temporary takeover of the local port of Khor Al-Zubair in early March 2005 and Tha'rallah's threats to kill the port's workers. More recently, it has been implicated in the intimidation and assassination of Sunni Arabs in the southern provinces and in ongoing attempts to penetrate and control the Basra police forces. (REF. P, Q, R, S, T)  11. (S//NF) This activity has a distinctly Islamist, pro-Iranian tenor, and is targeted at political opponents that are, though Shia and Islamist in stripe, less supportive of Iranian influence, and targeted more generally at the population at large in order to project a sense of moral authority and enforce a rigorously Islamic code of conduct. Anecdotal reporting about the climate of intimidation and repression in the southernmost provinces is increasing. (REF. N)  ------------------------------------------ TARGETING AMERICANS - THE SHEIBANI NETWORK ------------------------------------------  12.  (S//NF) Explosively-formed penetrator (EFP) charges, with a directed metal diaphragm that dynamically transforms upon detonation into an aerodynamic projectile traveling at 2000 meters per second, can punch through one side of an armored vehicle and out the other with catastrophic consequences to occupants inside. In recent months, this advanced Improvised Explosive Device (IED) technology has been identified in a growing number of deadly IED attacks against Coalition Forces throughout southern Iraq. The use of such devices appears to be expanding. Its introduction into the Iraq theatre of operations has been directly linked to the IRGC-backed network of Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, a former IRGC-QF agent and Badr intelligence chief. In its cellular structure and operating methods, the network is reported to be modeled after Lebanese Hizballah, itself an organization historically known to be supported by the IRGC-QF. (COMMENT. EFP technology has been widely used by Hizballah and its Palestinian surrogates against the Israeli Army. END COMMENT.) According to a former member of the organization, Sheibani's organization receives training both in Iraq and Iran, and Lebanese Hizballah instructors, using excerpts from professionally developed Hizballah instructional videos, have taught detailed construction and placement techniques for EFP IEDs. Evidence also suggests close ties to other IRGC-QF surrogates such as Sayyid Al-Shuhadah for operational and logistical support. (REFS. J, U, V, W)  13.  (S//NF) Since January 2004, the use of EFP technology has resulted in an estimated 16 deaths and about 35 wounded with a 200 percent increase in fatalities over the last month. Though the overall numbers of IEP/EFP attacks have been very low compared to those by other identified non-Shia insurgent groups, the lethality of these attacks with their capacity to defeat vehicle armor has been extremely high. It is speculated that Sheibani's organization is only one of several such IRGC-supported networks that are being cultivated to maintain a latent capability to direct highly lethal attacks on Coalition Forces when required. It is also surmised that the ability to field EFP devices may have spread to Sunni insurgent elements, and MNF-I is actively targeting key leaders of Sheibani's elusive network who transit frequently across the border between Iran and Iraq. The devastating effects of EFPs on Coalition Forces indicate that kinetic IRGC-QF activity in Iraq is not limited to coercion or violence directed at indigenous political opponents, but also involves a nascent capability and demonstrated willingness to target American lives.  (REFS. X, Y, Z)  --------------------------------------------- ----- CONCLUSIONS: COUNTERING THE MANY FACES OF THE IRGC --------------------------------------------- -----  14.  (S//NF) Beneath a relative calm, benign surface exists a dark, menacing undercurrent of aggressive IRGC activity inimical to U.S. interests in Iraq's center-south. As a result, present efforts to promulgate democracy and the rule -of law in Shia-majority areas face particular challenges:  -     Iran's (including IRGC's) patronage of SCIRI, Badr, and other pro-Iranian Shia groups erodes public confidence in the political process by supplanting genuine public discourse with Iranian-funded patronage, media propaganda, and bribery.  -     The Badr militia's more aggressive activity in center-south, particularly in Najaf, Karbala, and Qadissiyah could suppress the restrained, quietist message of the Shia Marja', typified by Ayatollah Al-Sistani, that has largely been a brake against radicalization of the Shia population at large; overall, Badr's activity degrades the rule -of law.  -     Attempts by more radical IRGC-supported groups in the south to aggressively islamicize local communities undermine efforts to develop a more civic-oriented, libertarian political culture, and, if left unchecked, foster more radical activity.  -     Munitions and weapons trafficking supported by the IRGC continues to be an explicit threat to Coalition Forces and the ISF and compromises their ability to maintain positive control of the security environment.  15. (S//NF) We need to continue the following steps to mitigate these trends:  -     Assure vigilance in monitoring the upcoming electoral processes in the South and thwart any efforts to subvert or distort them.  -     Continue to oppose strenuously the existence of militia organizations not under the control of the national authority.  -     Extend U.S. sponsored democratization programs that advocate participation, transparency, and accountability into southern Iraq, not just in predominantly Sunni areas.  -     Monitor carefully the eastern Iraqi border with Iran to stem the illicit transit of people, weapons and ordnance, and money.  -     Demarche the Iranian government on the IRGC's involvement in insurgent operations in Iraq, and maintain Iraqi and regional pressure on Iran to live up to its stated commitment to help ensure a secure and stable Iraq.  15.

Satterfield for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY: Iraq Ambassador-designate to Egypt, Safia al-Suhail, worries that Iraqi-Egyptian relations will chill unless the Iraqi government takes the initiative after the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the Egyptian Charge. Al-Suhail told PolOff July 18 that before this tragic incident, bilateral relations were on the upswing.  The Iraqis are now waiting word from the Egyptians to travel to Cairo to deliver a condolence letter from President Talabini to President Mubarak.  To al-Suhail, however, the Iraqi government is more interested in cultivating relations with Iran than with Sunni Arab countries and risks cooling its relations with Egypt.  She also alleges that Iraqi Baathists in Cairo, including the former Iraqi Ambassador there, are lobbying the Egyptian government not to recognize the current Iraqi regime.  Much of what al-Suhail perceives as misguided Iraqi focus is really disorganization in Baghdad and an inability of the Iraqi bureaucracy to pursue multiple initiatives at one time.  Our encouragement of both governments not to succumb to the recent setback and to continue their efforts to improve their relationship will be helpful.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C/NF) Long-time Embassy contact and Iraq Ambassador-designate to Egypt, Safia al-Suhail, warned PolOff July 18 that Iraqi-Egyptian relations could chill unless the Iraqi government takes the initiative to improve them after the July 2 kidnapping of the Egyptian Charge in Iraq, Ambassador Ihab al Sherif (Reftel).  (Note: The Egyptian government announced July 7 that al-Sherif's captors, reportedly an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, had executed him. End Note).  Al-Suhail explained that before this tragic incident occurred, the Egyptian government had granted her agrement, and she was preparing to travel to Cairo to assume her duties. (Bio note:  Al-Suhail, a Shia Arab from the prominent al-Tamimi tribe, is the women's activist who attended the President's 2005 State of the Union address in Washington.  Al-Suhail supports former PM Ayad Allawi, and she is critical of the current Iraqi government.  Her husband, Baktiar Amin, who is a Sunni Kurd, was the Minister of Human Rights under the Allawi government.  End  Bio note.)  3.  (C/NF) Al-Suhail related that President Talabani had asked her to deliver a condolence letter to his Egyptian counterpart Mubarak.  The Iraqi Foreign Ministry had sent a dipnote to the Egyptian MFA requesting a suitable travel date to deliver the letter.  The Egyptians had not given the Iraqis a date, and rather, asked them to wait awhile.  In the meantime, the Egyptian Embassy in Baghdad had virtually closed its operations, leaving one employee to answer the phone.  Iraqis requiring Egyptian visas must now travel to Amman, explained al-Suhail.  The comments of some Iraqi officials suggesting that al-Sherif had possibly been killed "because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time," perhaps even meeting with insurgents, had drawn the ire of the Egyptians, she added.  4.  (C/NF) Though Foreign Minister Zebari had assured al-Suhail he would contact the Egyptians again about the travel date, Zebari had left with the Prime Minister to Iran without doing so.  Al-Suhail opined that the Iraqi government was more focused on Iranian ties than with relations with Egypt and other Sunni Arab countries.  This lopsided approach would do little to assuage the fears of Sunni Arabs in Iraq and other countries that the current Iraqi government might ally with Iran to their detriment, she alleged.  5.  (C/NF) Meanwhile, Iraqi Baathists residing in Cairo were lobbying the Egyptian government not to recognize the Iraqi government, asserted al-Suhail.  She claimed that the head of this lobby effort is former Iraqi Ambassador Mohsen Khalil, who received political asylum in Egypt.  Al-Suhail added that Mustapha Bakri, who heads an Egyptian opposition party and had supported Saddam Hussein, was also aiding Iraqi Baathists efforts to erode a still-delicate bilateral relationship. Al-Suhail observed that the Iraqi MFA's administrative undersecretary, Sa'ad al-Hayani, was in some way complicit with this Baathist lobby effort.  He had stalled on her agrement paperwork, she complained.  6.  (C/NF) Comment: Some of what al-Suhail sees as conspiracy or misguided focus within the Iraqi government is, in fact, the result of bureaucratic disorganization in Baghdad.  The Iraqi MFA, for example, takes few initiatives on even routine matters in the absence of Foreign Minister Zebari.  The Prime Minister's office likewise has great trouble organizing itself to give guidance to the MFA.  Thus, the PM's office can focus its work on a trip to Iran, but that process means its staffers will take no time on others issues such as, for example, repairing relations with Egypt.  Nonetheless, from our perspective in Baghdad, al-Suhail's conclusion that the kidnapping and reported murder of the Egyptian Charge has chilled the fragile Iraqi-Egyptian bilateral ties appears correct.  Our encouragement of both governments not to succumb to the recent setback and to continue seeking to improve their relationship will be helpful.  It would be useful, for example, for the Egyptian MFA to encourage the Iraqis to send th eir delegation sooner rather than later.  End Comment.  7.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 003017  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/20/2015 TAGS: PINS, PTER, PGOV, PREL, KDEM, IZ, Elections, Electoral Commision SUBJECT: FOUR IECI EMPLOYEES KILLED IN A TARGETED ATTACK; SLOW PROGRESS ON VOTER REGISTRATION PREPARATIONS  Classified By: Charge d' Affaires David M. Satterfield for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Summary.  The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) has confirmed that four employees were killed on July 17 as a result of a car-bomb attack on the East Baghdad Governorate office.  Although IECI has made little progress in signing a logistics contract and launching a media/public outreach campaign, IECI remains confident that registration will start on or before August 7.  IECI plans to open 15 Voter Registration Centers (VRCs) in Anbar (in Falluja and Ramadi) and 55 VRCs in Ninewa, and has formally requested close security support from MNF-I.  The TNA will likely pass the referendum law on July 24.  End Summary.  IECI OFFICE CAR-BOMBED ----------------------  2. (C) The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) has confirmed that a July 17 car-bomb attack on the East Baghdad Governorate office killed two IECI staffers and two security guards.  Additionally, four IECI employees were wounded, two critically, said IECI Director of Operations Dr. Ali Abid Al-Elah.  He told PolOff on July 18 that there had not been any threats against IECI employees since the January election, and he remains optimistic that IECI employees will not be intimidated by this incident. (In the run up to the January 2005 election, three IECI workers were killed in an attack on the West Baghdad Governorate office on December 7, and another three IECI staffers were dragged from their car and killed on Haifa street on December 19.  To their credit, IECI staffers did not resign following the attacks.)  ELECTORAL PREPARATIONS ----------------------  3. (C) Despite making little progress in signing a logistics contract and launching a media/public outreach campaign, IECI continues to maintain confidence that registration will start on or before August 7.  - LOGISTICS.  The Board of Commissioners has selected National Air Cargo for the USD 8 million logistics contract for the delivery of voter lists, registration forms, and other materials.  Director of Operations Dr. Ali said that the Board is waiting for National Air Cargo to present a final contract agreement to IECI to sign.  He said overseas printing of blank registration forms and voter lists are on schedule and should be ready before July 21.  - PUBLIC OUTREACH.  The media/public outreach section of IECI is far from ready, however, to begin a campaign informing and encouraging Iraqis to participate in the voter registration update program.  Recently, several senior administrators and commissioners could not predict when the first TV ads would run, and instead openly criticized their media section for being unprepared.  A robust media campaign was to have started two weeks before the start of voter registration in August.  A United Nations media expert here on a one-week TDY has been advising the Iraqi media staff to prepare the launch.  - VRCs.  About 550 Voter Registration Center (VRC) locations have been identified, and security plans are being developed and coordinated among IECI, MOI, MOD and MNF-I.  Dr. Ali said IECI plans to open 15 VRCs in Anbar (in Falluja and Ramadi) and 55 VRCs in Ninewa, and formally asked MNF-I for close security support.  He said IECI will not open VRCs near the Anbar border area near Syria because of fighting there; to mitigate the security risk, the Anbar VRCs will be located as close as possible to existing military checkpoints.  - REGISTRATION MONITORS.  IECI plans to accredit observers and political party agents for the August registration.  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) sponsored Coalition of Non-Partisan Election Monitors (CINEM) - a group of 100 or so Iraqi NGOs that observed the January election - said it is ready to monitor the next election.  NDI advisor Jabouri told PolOff that CINEM is better positioned now as a NGO monitoring network than it was in during the January elections because it has actively purged non-performing NGOs and added new NGOs, including some from Anbar.  - REFERENDUM LAW.  The TNA will vote on the referendum law on July 24.  TNA Legal Committee Chairman Mushen Saadoon said he expects the law to pass without problems.  - UN STAFFING.  After a four-month absence of UN electoral assistance leadership, the new team leader David Avery is expected to arrive in Baghdad on July 24, and the new UN IECI Commissioner Gerardo Chevalier is expected on July 27. Together with the UN liaison official to the IECI Jan Malekzade, who is on the ground, they will lead the group of international electoral experts assisting the IECI.  OUTREACH BY SUNNIS ------------------  4. (C) CEO Allami told PolOff that Sunni leader Adnan Dulaimey approached the Anbar Governorate Office to encourage it to open voter registration centers in Anbar.  One idea Dulaimey proposed is to allow VRCs to be located in mosques. IECI is likely to reject this idea since the lines of responsibility in using, controlling and protecting mosques as VRCs would be difficult and unclear.  (Comment.  Not having voted in the January elections, Dulaimey's active interest in opening VRCs is a positive indicator that Sunnis in Anbar are determined to participate in the electoral process.  End comment.)  5. (U) REO HILLAH, REO BASRAH, REO MOSUL, and REO KIRKUK, minimize considered. Satterfield
