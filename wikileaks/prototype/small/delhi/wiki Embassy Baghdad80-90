S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 3988  FOR MANAMA POLITICAL OFFICERS' MEETING NEW DELHI FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY MURPHY LONDON FOR RAPHEL PARIS FOR WINN  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS: MOPS, PREL, IZ, IR, XF SUBJECT: THE GULF WAR: PROSPECTS FOR PEACE OR EXPANSION  REF: STATE 323960   1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT.  2. SUMMARY: THE GULF WAR WILL LIKELY BUT NOT NECESSARILY REMAIN STALEMATED. IRAQ DOMINATES IN EVERY MAJOR WEAPONS CATEGORY AND HAS CONSTRUCTED FORMIDABLE DEFENSES. YET, ALL IS NOT WELL. THE IRANIANS CONTINUE TO MAKE INROADS EVEN WHILE PAYING DEARLY FOR THEM. OVER TIME THE WILL OF IRAQI FORCES TO RESIST COULD BECOME INCREASINGLY BRITTLE. THE STAKES INVOLVED FOR WESTERN INTERESTS ARE TOO VITAL TO PERMIT COMPLACENCY. AN IRANIAN VICTORY WOULD REDRAW THE POLITICAL AS WELL AS THE GEOGRAPHIC MAP. THE DANGER IS NOT THAT IRAQ'S ACTIONS WILL SPARK A WIDER WAR BUT THAT IT WILL OVERESTIMATE ITS ABILITIES TO SUSTAIN A DETERMINED DEFENSE. IN ANY CASE, IRAN WILL NOT NOW ATTEMPT A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON OTHER GULF ARAB STATES BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE THEIR RULING REGIMES OR AT MINIMUM INTIMIDATE THEM INTO STRICT NEUTRALITY. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE SOVIETS WILL GAIN ADVANTAGES IN IRAN AT OUR EXPENSE ARE GROSSLY EXAGGERATED GIVEN THE DIVERGENT POLICIES OF THE TWO STATES AND THVIR ANTITHETICAL INTERESTS. END SUMMARY.  3. THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN A BLOODY STALEMATE FOR THE LAST THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS WITH IRANIAN SOLDIERS PAYING A TERRIBLE PRICE TO ACHIEVE MINOR TACTICAL GAINS. GIVEN IRAN'S GROSS INFERIORITY IN THE FULL RANGE OF MODERN WEAPONRY AND IRAQ'S FORMIDABLE, IF LARGELY STATIC, DEFENSIVE LINES, THE STALEMATE SHOULD CONTINUE. HOWEVER, WARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE. INDIVIDUAL MOTIVATION AND UNIT ESPIRIT STILL COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL. IN THESE CATEGORIES, IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND RAG- TAG BASIJ CLEARLY HOLD SWAY. MOREOVER, THE IRAQI POLITICAL LEADER- SHIP'S DETERMINATION TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES AND TO USE ITS VAST AIR SUPERIORITY SPARINGLY LEAVE THE INITIATIVE TO IRAN'S FORCES -- A SITUATION THAT CERTAINLY MUST DEMORALIZE AT LEAST SOME OF THE MORE PROFESSIONAL OFFICEERS AND NON-COMS IN IRAQ'S ARMY. EVEN MORE PUZZLING IS THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES' APPARENT WILLING- NESS TO ALLOW THEIR ADVERSARIES TO BUILD CAUSEWAYS AND PONTOON BRIDGES THROUGHOUT THE VAST HUWAYZAH MARSHES WITH ONLY SPORADIC HARRASSMENT FROM H&I FIRE OR AIR STRIKES. MILITARY ATTACHES AND ADVISERS IN BAGHDAD ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN IRAQ'S PASSIVITY AND VIOLATION OF SOME BASIC RULES OF WARFARE.  4. NEVERTHELESS, THOSE WHO MEET WITH IRAQI COMMANDERS AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FIND THEM EXUDING CONFIDENCE. AND, PERHAPS, NOT WITHOUT REASON. MASSIVE IRANIAN OFFENSIVES HAVE BEEN BROKEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHERE IRAQI LINES HAVE BEEN BREACHED, THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO EXPLOIT IT BECAUSE OF INADEQUACIES IN PLANNING, MOBILITY, AIR, ARMOR AND ARTILLERY SUPPORT AND LOGISTICS. INDEED, THESE FACTORS RATHER THAN IRAQI PROWESS MAKE A CONTINUED STALEMATE LIKELY.  5. TO CONTEMPLATE AN IRANIAN VICTORY REQUIRES THE SUPPOSITION THAT IRAQI FORCES AFTER SUFFERING A MAJOR, BUT INDECISIVE, BATTLEFIELD REVERSE, PANIC AND A GENERAL ROUT BEGINS SOMEWHAT ON THE ORDER OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ARVN TROOPS IN 1975. ALTHOUGH THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WITH GOOD INTERIOR LINES OF DEFENSE COULD BE EXPECTED TO RUSH IN FRESH TROOPS TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE, THE FACT IS THAT FEW FOREIGNERS HAVE ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IRAQI TROOPS WOULD HANDLE SUCH A REVERSE. WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE A COLLAPSE CANNOT BE RULED OUT, IT REMAINS IMPROBABLE FOR THE NEAR- TERM.  6. YET, THE STAKES IN THIS WAR ARE SUCH THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES SHOULD GUARD AGAINST COMPLACENCY. EVEN IF ONE ASSIGNS THE IRANIANS ONLY A 10-15 PERCENT POSSIBILITY OF VICTORY, THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD CERTAINLY BE CATESTROPHIC.  7. FEW DOUBT THAT KHOMEINI WANTS HIS INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REGION OR THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED TO DOMINATE IRAQ. EVEN NOW THE IRANIANS ARE SEEKING TO UNDERMINE SEVERAL GULF REGIMES, MOST NOTABLY IN BAHRAIN AND KUWAIT. THE SAUDI RULING FAMILY IS THE OBJECT OF SCORN IN TEHRAN AND THEIR RIGHT TO ACT AS SOLE GUARDIANS OF THE HOLY PLACES HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION. IRANIAN FEELINGS TOWARD KING HUSSEIN AS A CRONY OF THE SHAH AND MORE RECENTLY AS AN ALLY OF IRAQ HARDLY NEED MENTIONING. DESPITE REPORTED ISRAELI AID FOR IRAN EARLIER IN THE WAR AND THEIR MUTUAL ANTIPATHY FOR IRAQ, ISRAEL AND ITS RULE OVER JERUSALEM SERVE AS POWERFUL SYMBOLS THROUGH WHICH IRANIAN PROPAGANDA TRIES TO ROUSE ARAB AND NON-ARAB MUSLIMS ALIKE. THE ACTIONS OF IRANIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS IN LEBANON SUCH AS HIZBALLAH AND ISLAMIC AMAL WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IRANIAN VITUPERATION DIRECTED AT ISRAEL IS MORE THAN RHETORICAL.  8. EVEN A VICTORIOUS IRAN WITH LESSER AMBITIONS AT MINIMUM COULD EXPECT TO DOMINATE OIL POLICY IN THE REGION AND FORCE A CHOICE AMONG GULF RULERS BETWEEN DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE U.S. OR EMBRACING US A NEVER BEFORE. BOTH SCENARIOS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND UNSTABLE.  9. IF THIS ANALYSIS IS VALID, THEN IRAQ NEEDS BOLSTERING AND FEARS THAT ITS ACTIONS AGAINST KHARG OR IRAN'S INTERIOR WOULD SPREAD THE WAR, WHILE UNDERSTANDABLE, SHOULD BE SUBORDINATED TO REDUCING FURTHER THE ODDS THAT IT MIGHT LOSE. IN TRUTH IRAQ WAS TOO BOLD IN STARTING THIS WAR AND IS TOO TIMID IN PROSECUTING IT.  10. THE LONGER THE WAR DRAGS ON, THE MORE LIKELY AN IRAQI COLLAPSE BECOMES. A KHOMEINI-LED IRAN WILL NOT WIND DOWN OR END THE WAR UNLESS NO OTHER VIABLE OPTION EXISTS. THIS REQUIRES IRAN BE DENIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE INCOME AND ARMS. THE IRANIANS ARE NOT GOING TO SPREAD THE WAR BY MAKING A SUSTAINED FRONTAL ASSAULT AGAINST THE GULF STATES, REALIZING ALL TOO WELL WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. RATHER, THEY CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SEEK SUBVERSIVE ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE GULF REGION WHILE PROBING PRESSURE POINTS AND PRACTICING GENERAL INTIMIDATION.  11. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE SOVIETS WILL MAKE INROADS INTO IRAN WOULD SEEM GROSSLY EXAGGERATED. THE SOVIET UNION, NOT THE U.S., IS IRAQ'S PRINCIPAL ARMS SUPPLIER; THE ENEMY OF THE MUJAHIDIN IN AFGHANISTAN; THE BACKER OF THE TUDEH PARTY; AND THE RULERS OF 40 MILLION MUSLIMS INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS. THE SOVIETS HAVE HARDLY RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO RECENT IRANIAN OVERTURES LARGELY BECAUSE THE IDEOLOGY OF IRAN'S RULING CLERICS PREVENTS THEM FROM MAKING THE SOVIETS A SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE OFFER TO SWITCH SIDES.-/   NEWTON 
C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 1907  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS: PREL, IZ, IR, MOPS SUBJECT: IRAQI AIR FORCE BOMBS TEHRAN REFINERY  1. (U) AS REPORTED THE RAQI AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED THE TEHRAN OIL REFINERY MAY 7. MILITARY COMMUNIQUE 2216 RELEASED MAY 8 SAYS "GROUPS OF AIRCRAFT" FLEW TO TEHRAN AND STRUCK THE CHOSEN TARGETS: THE REFINERY'S MAIN NOTHERN DISTILLING TOWER, AND THE CENTRAL BOILERS AND COOLING TOWER COMPLEX. THZ IRAQI AIR FORCE REPORTEDLY USED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN AUGUST 1982 TO PLAN THE RAID, AND THE LOCAL PAPERS MAY 8 PRINT THESE PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE RECENT DESTRUCTION. TAKEN FROM AN ANGLE (DIRECTLY OVERHEAD), ALL THAT IS DISCERNIBLE ARE TWO COLUMNS OF BILLOWING BLACK SMOKE; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AND WASNOT HIT.  2. (U) IN A MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT, AIR FORCE COMMANDER HAMID SHABAN BOASTED THAT THE BOMBING WAS "THE FIRST OPERATION OF THIS TYPE IN ARAB HISTORY," BUT DID NOT ELABORATE. HE DECCARED THE AIR FORCE READY TO STRIKE THE IRANIANS WHERE AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES.  3. (U) WE NOTE WIRE SERVICE REPORTS FROM TEHRAN THAT INDICATE ONLY ONE BOMB WAS DROPPED, AND THAT ON A TANK FARM. IRAQI NEWSPAPERS, CONVERSELY, ARE CLAIMING "THE REFINERY WAS REDUCED TO ASHES" (BAGHDAD OBSERVER), "THE REFINERY IS NOW DEBRIS AND WRECKAGE" (QADISIYA), OR SIMPLY "DESTROYSD" (THAWRA).  4. (C) COMMENT: THIS ATTACK IS IN LINE WITH RECENT STATEMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE AIR FORCE COMMANDER THAT IRAQ INTENDS TO TAKE THE WAR TO THE ENEMY. AFTER A SIMILAR STRIKE AT THE ISFAHAN REFINERY MARCH 13 THE IRAQI MEDIA ALSO MADE SWEEPING CLAIMS, ALTHOUGH ULTIMATELY THE RAID WAS SHOWN TO BE LESS THAN EFFECTIVE. THIS AGAIN MAY BE THE CASE. WE CANNOT DISCERN EXACTLY WHAT SHABAN WAS REFERRING TO IN HIS COMMENT TO THE PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN, PERHAPS, MID-AIR RE- FUELING OF THE ATTACK AIRCRAFT. WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS WHETHER THE IRAQIS FOLLOW THIS RAID UP WITH FURTHER STRIKES AGAINST REFINERIES OR OTHER INSTALLATIONS IN OR ADJACENT TO TEHRAN. MOST LIKELY THE RAID IS MEANT TO GIVE THE IRAQI PUBLIC A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST, SINCE THE IRAQIS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO EMPLOY THE AIR FORCE IN A SUSTAINED MANNER AGAINST STRATEGIC ECONOMIC TARGETS. THE IRANIANS ARE UNLIKELY TO RETALIATE IN KIND FOR THIS ONE STRIKE, BUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO HIT BAGHDAD IF THE IRAQIS KEEP IT UP.THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WILL BE WARY OF INSTIGATING A POLICY OF STRIKES AT TEHRAN, SINCE THE CONSEQUENCE SURELY WILL BE A SPATE OF DEMORALIZING SCUD MISSLE ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 05528  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS: PREL, USUN, IZ, IR SUBJECT: RAFSANJANI STICKS TO NAMING AGGRESSOR BEFORE -        CEASEFIRE  REF: BAGHDAD 5515  1. (C) DURING RECENT MEETING, MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTOR AL-QAYSI PROVIDED DCM WITH MFA ARABIC TRANSLATION OF OCTOBER 25 TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW WITH RAFSANJANI IN WHICH RAFSANJANI SAID THAT NAMING THE AGGRESSOR MUST PRECEDE A CEASEFIRE AND THAO ONLY NAMING THE AGGRESSOR OR DEFEATING THE AGGRESSOR WILL END THE WAR.  AL-QAYSI ASKED RHETORICALLY WHY IRAQ SHOULD BE ASKED TO ABANDON THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER OF 598 WHEN IRAN, AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT "THE AGGRESSOR BE NAMED" BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A CEASEFIRE, MUCH LESS WITHDRAWAL.  THAT SAID, HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE AVOIDED GIVING ANY HINT OF IRAQ'S POSITION ON SIMULTANEOUS VS SEQUENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION PENDING DELIVERY OF IRAQ'S RESPONSE TO THE SYG OCTOBER 30 (REFTEL).  2. (U) FOR THE RECORD, INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF MFA TRANSLATION OF THE INTERVIEW FOLLOWS.  BEGIN TEXT:  INTERVIEW WITH RAFSANJANI TEHRAN RADIO 2330, OCTOBER 25, 1987  Q. MY QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH THE GULF WAR.  THE UNSG HAS SUGGESTED A PLAN OF NINE POINTS TO EFFECT A TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE AND ESTABLISH A COURT TO JUDGE THE AGGRESSOR.  REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE UNSG HAS PASSED THEIR SUGGESTION TO OFFICIALS OF BOTY COUNTRIES (IRAN AND IRAQ).  WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THIS AND WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN?  A. WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A THING.  ITS CONTENT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED.  IT HAS BEEN AGREED TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE AGGRESSOR AND THAT IT SHOULD START ITS WORK.  IT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A CEASEFIRE SHOULD TAKE PLACE, BUT THE TIMING OF THESE TWO THINGS HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.  WE BELIEVE THAT A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER THE AGGRESSOR IS NAMED AND, IN THIS CONNECTION, THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE UNSG, AND OTHERS.  WE DO NOT WANT TO USE DELAYING TACTICS AND PROLONG THE DISCUSSIONS AS SOME PARTIES EXPECT AND BELIEVE.  FROM THE BEGINNING, WE HAVE SAID OUR LAST WORD.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO END THE WAR:  (1) TO NAME THE AGGRESSOR; (2) TO DEFEAT THE AGGRESSOR, WHICH WILL END THE WAR AUTOMATICALLY.  THE FIRST WILL END THE WAR BY POLITICAL METHODS; THE SECOND WILL END IT BY MILITARY MEANS.  IF THE UNSC DOES ITS DUTY AND ACCEPTS ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, THE FIRST (POLITICAL METHOD) WILL PREVAIL AND COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.  END TEXT.  NEWTON 
C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 00028  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS:  PINS IZ SUBJECT:  CHRISTIANS IN MOSUL  1.  (C-ENTIRE TEXT)  2.  ON DECEMBER 29 AMBASSADOR CALLED ON SENIOR CHRISTIAN CLERIC RESIDENT IN MOSUL, CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP GARMO (STRICTLY PROTECT), FOR DISCUSSION OF CHRISTIAN CONDITIONS IN MOSUL AREA.  3.  GARMO TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY FURTHER DISTURBING OF CHRISTIAN VILLAGES.  AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, WHAT RELOCATION THERE HAS BEEN HAS BEEN OVER FOR WEEKS.  THE CHRISTIAN (NOT JUST CHALDEAN) VILLAGES TO THE NORTH OF MOSUL IN THE AREA AROUND TELL KAYF ARE EXISTING NORMALLY. (A SUBSEQUENT VISIT TO SEVERAL OF THOSE VILLAGES CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE CASE.)  4.  THE TWO CHIEF ISSUES ON THE PATRIARCH'S MIND, GARMO SAID, ARE THE CHRISTIAN DESIRE TO OBTAIN PERMISSION FOR CHRISTIAN TEACHING IN THE SCHOOLS, (THIS IS ALLOWED ONLY IF THE STUDENT BODY LS 51& CHRISTIAN), AND THE WISH FOR SOME KIND OF NEWSLETTER.  5.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE PATRIARCH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT WITH SADDAM FOR SOME TIME.  WHILE THE "UNPRECEDENTED" CHRISTMAS GREETINGS FROM SADDAM TO THE PATRIARCH ON CHRISTMAS EVE HAD RAISED HOPES, THEY WERE DASHED WHEN SADDAM CONTINUED TO PUT OFF THE PATRIARCH, BUT DID RECEIVE THE CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TINY CHALDEAN LEBANESE COMMUNITY.  6.  LOCALLY, THE GOVERNOR IS UNFAILINGLY PLEASANT, BUT WILL TAKE NO INITIATIVE.  THE ARCHBISHOP, THEREFORE, RELIES ON THE HEAD OF SECURITY FOR  MOSUL, A NEW APPOINTEE WHO HAS SO FAR PROVED HELPFUL AND COMPASSIONATE. BUT THIS IS A WEAK REED, AND THE CHURCH WOULD NATURALLY PREFER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOP.  IN THE CASE OF SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM THE CHRISTIANS STILL REGARD THEIR ACE IN THE HOLE TO BE ADNAN KHAIRALLAH'S FATHER, WHO IS ACCESSIBLE AND HAS BEEN HELPFUL DURING DIFFICULT TIMES IN THE PAST.  7.  IN VISITING MONASTERIES AND VILLAGES NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST OF MOSUL,     EMBASSY OFFICIALS DID SEE MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE CHRISTIANS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPANKING NEW VILLAGES, MARKED "SADDAM MODEL VILLAGE," AND THE 4TH CENTURY MONASTERY AT MAR BAHNAM HAS RECEIVED AN EXPENSIVE FACELIFTING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, INCLUDING EXPENSIVE NEW MARBLE FACING.

C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 00224  PASS TO CONGEN DUBAI  E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, IR, IZ SUBJECT:  THE RELIGIOUS SUCCESSION IN IRAN  REF:  ABU DHABI 137  1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT.  2.  AN ARAB BUSINESSMAN IN REFTEL SAID THAT GRAND AYATOLLAH KHOI'S RELATIVES IN IRAN ALLEGE THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF IRANIAN SHI'A, AND ALMOST ALL IRAQI SHI'A, FOLLOW KHOI'S INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WE HAVE RECEIVED MUCH THE SAME VERSION FROM ONE OF KHOI'S SONS HERE.  WE ALSO RECALL EARLIER CONGEN DHAHRAN REPORTING THAT A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE OF SAUDI SHI'A ADHERE TO HIM.  3.  WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RELIABLE CONFIRMATION OF KHOI'S APPEAL IN IRAN.  WE ARE NOT SO SURE ABOUT CONGEN DUBAI'S ASSESSMENT THAT KHOI'S POSITION MAY HAVE BEEN ERODED IN IRAN.  AFTER ALL, KHOMEINI WAS IN NAJAF FOR FOURTEEN YEARS, WHICH DID NOTHING TO ERODE HIS STANDING IN IRAN.  KHOI HAS BEEN IN NAJAF FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY, FOLLOWING A TRADITION OF IRANIAN AYATOLLAHS THAT GOES BACK TO 1722.  WE DOUBT, AS SUGGESTED BY REFTEL'S SOURCE,THAT KHOI HAS COME TO BAGHDAD OR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN ANTI- KHOMEINI BROADCASTS.  ALTHOUGH HE IS CERTAINLY NO FRIEND OF KHOMEINI, WHOM HE CONSIDERS AN UPSTART WITH DUBIOUS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS, HE HAS STEAD- FASTLY REFUSED TO TAKE SIDES PUBLICLY ON THE WAR.  4.  WHETHER KHOI IS ACTUALLY A THREAT TO MONTAZERI OR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO KHOMEINI IS ANOTHER MATTER, SINCE KHOI, WHO IS NOW AGED AND INFIRM, IS NO MORE POLITICALLY ORIENTED, WE UNDER- STAND, THAN GOLPAYEGANI.  KHOI HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF THE QUIETIST SCHOOL OF AYATOL- LAHS WHO INSIST THAT CLERICS SHOULD STAY OUT OF GOVERNMENT.  UNLIKE KHOMEINI'S CASE, ALLEGIANCE TO KHOI'S RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN SUPPORT OF A POLITICAL NATURE.  THE ISSUE, AS REFTEL POINTED OUT, IS THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF A SUCCESSOR REGIME WILL DEPEND TO A MAJOR DEGREE ON THE PERCEPTION OF ITS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS.  5.  ONE ISSUE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO US IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE USULI SCHOOL OF TWELVER SHI'A ISLAM DOMINANT IN IRAN THAT RULINGS OF A CLERIC, NO MATTER HOW PROMINENT, LOSE THEIR VALIDITY WHEN HE DIES, ENTIRELY UNLIKE THE SUNNIS OR THE MINORITY TWELVER SCHOOL WHO HAVE A CORPUS OF CANON LAWS. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT IRAN HAS A CLERGY AND THE ARAB STATES DO NOT IN THE SAME SENSE.  WE WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT THE RULINGS OF KHOI, A VERY TRADITIONAL CLERIC, NOT TO OUTLIVE HIM. WHETHER KHOMEINI'S WILL IS THE QUESTION.  IF SO, HE WILL BE THE FIRST AYATOLLAH TO HAVE A "CALIPH"(SUCC ESSOR),  AND SHI'A ISLAM IN IRAN AND ITS ROLE IN THE COUNTRY WILL BE CHANGED IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.   NEWTON 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BAGHDAD 00855  C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (PARAGRAPH 3, LAST THREE SENTENCES)  E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR TAGS:  PGOV, MOPS, PHUM, PTER, PINR, IZ, IR SUBJECT:  VIEWS OF IRANIAN KURDISH LEADER QASSEMLU  1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT.  2.  SUMMARY:  COMING DOWN OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR ONE OF HIS OCCASIONAL TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, IRANIAN KURDISH LEADER QASSEMLU MET SADDAM FEBRUARY 10.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT INTENSE SHELLING IN THE AREA OF HIS FORMER HEADQUAR- TERS (DOWNRIVER FROM THE EMBATTLED TOWN OF MAWAT) HAD FORCED HIM RECENTLY TO MOVE 35 KILOMETERS NORTH.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS AND THE CAPABILITY TO CALL ON MANY MORE AND TO HAVE AMPLE ARMS (CAPTURED FROM IRANIANS) AND MONEY (THROUGH SMUGGLING). HE MADE AN APPEAL FOR U.S. "MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT," NOTING THAT HIS PARTY HAS ALWAYS STRONGLY DISAPPROVED OF HOSTAGE-TAKING.  THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR HAS APPROACHED HIM ON BEHALF OF KIDNAPPEES HELD BY TALABANI AND HE IS HOPEFUL THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEM FREED.  3.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED HIS RELATIONS WITH TALABANI AS GOOD, ALTHOUGH HIS POLICY OF STRICT NEUTRALITY BETWEEN TALABANI AND THE IRAQIS SOMETIMES CAUSES FRICTION. QASSEMLU RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR AN ALLIANCE WITH OTHER IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS, BUT RAJAVI--WHOM  HE DESCRIBED AS AN "AMATEUR"--SEEMS UNWILLING.  RAJAVI'S LIMITED MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE NORTH COMPLICATED QASSEMLU'S RELATIONS WITH TALABANI, AND RAJAVI WILL NOW MOVE HIS EFFORTS SOUTH.  UNLIKE RAJAVI, QASSEMLU AVOIDS EVER BEING PHOTOGRAPHED WITH SADDAM.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN AS STABLE, WHILE THE SITUATION IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS "SHARPLY DETERIORATED" (I.E., FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY IN BAGHDAD) DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE IRAQI VILLAGE DESTRUCTION CAMPAIGN HAS NOT YET BEEN MIRRORED ON A LARGE SCALE IN IRAN.   END SUMMARY  4.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 1988 CONGRESS OF THE DEMOCRA- TIC PARTY OF KURDISTAN OF IRAN (KDPI), SECRETARY GENERAL A.R. QASSEMLU (WHO SPELLS HIS NAME GHASSEMLOU) CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO MEET SADDAM HUSSEIN  FEBRUARY 10. BECAUSE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF IRANIAN KURDS IN SWEDEN AND FRANCE, QASSEMLU TYPICALLY CONTACTS THE SWEDISH AND FRENCH AMBASSADORS WHEN HE MAKES TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN MONTHS.  POLCHIEF LOBBIED SWEDLSH AMBASSADOR THOREN FOR A MEETING WITH QASSEMLU AND WAS INVITEO TO A SIX-HOUR LUNCH FEBRUARY 12.  QASSEMLU CAME ACROSS AS EX- TREMELY OPEN, SOPHISTICATED, AND ARTICULATE, EVEN IN ENGLISH WHICH IS ONLY HIS SIXTH-BEST LANGUAGE (AFTER KURDISH, PERSIAN, ARABIC, FRENCH, AND CZECH).  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DIRECTORS OF THE KDPI'S PARIS, STOCKHOLM,  AND BAGHDAD OFFICES (ABDULLAH GHEDERI, EBRAHIM DJEURABESKA, AND SALAM AZIZI).  ------------------------------- APPEAL FOR MORAL SUPPORT -------------------------------  5.  QASSEMLU MADE A STRONG APPEAL FOR AMERICAN "MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT."  HE OBSERVED THAT THE KDPI HAS ALWAYS HAD A POLICY OF STRONGLY OBJECTING TO TERRORISM AND HOSTAGE-TAKING, AND HE PROVIDED POLCHIEF WITH A PAPER HE HAD RECENTLY PRESENTED (THROUGH HIS REPRESEN- TATIVE) AT A PARIS SYMPOSIUM ON TERRORISM, IN WHICH HE OBJECTED TO TERRORISM AS A TOOL FOR REVOLUTIONARY LIBERATION GROUPS.  HE CLAIMED TO BE PERPLEXED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS RECEIVED "A RAGTAG BUNCH OF BACKWARD AFGHAN FUNDAMENTALISTS" AND PERSISTS IN TRYING TO BOLSTER "NONVIABLE NICARAGUAN GROUPS," WHILE NOT AFFORDING ATTENTION TO "TRUE DEMOCRATIC GROUPS" WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR "UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS."  6.  POLCHIEF OBSERVED THAT THERE IS PUBLIC SYMPATHY FOR THE KURDISH SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES BUT NOT VERY MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT IT; QASSEMLU MIGHT DO WELL TO CULTIVATE JOURNALISTS.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HE HAD DONW WHILE IN BAGHDAD THIS TIME WAS TO PUSH THROUGH A VISA FOR THE WASHINGTON POSO'S  JONATHAN RANDAL (PARIS), WHO HE SAID IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT KURDS AND TO WHOM HE HAS GIVEN FOURTEEN HOURS OF INTERVIEW.  QASSEMLU LAMENTED THAT "THE SOVIETS ALWAYS TEND TO SEE THE KDPI AS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICANS AND THE AMERICANS ALWAYS SUSPECT THE SOVIETS" WHILE IN FACT THE KDPI HAS NO FRIENDS.  "OUR ONLY FRIENDS  ARE THE MOUNTAINS."  ------------------------ ITALIAN HOSTAGES ------------------------  7.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD JUST MET ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TOSCANO AND GIVEN HIM A PLEDGE TO DO WHAT HE COULD ABOUT THE THREE ITALIAN KIDNAPPEES BEING HELD BY TALABANI'S PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN (PUK).  HE NOTED THAT HE HAD INTERVENED OCCASIONALLY IN THE PAST, HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN INFLUENCING TALABANI TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, AND HE "HAD EVERY CONFIDENCE" THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN. (HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ITALIANS HAD APPROACHED HIM AND THUS HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY MADE ANY EFFORTS ON THE CIVILIAN'S BEHALF.)  QASSEMLU BETRAYED A TRACE OF ANNOYANCE THAT OTHER GROUPS' WILLINGNESS TO RESORT TO TERRORISM HAD GAINED THEM GREATER ATTENTION THAN THAT GIVEN THE KDPI, EVEN THOUGH THE KDPI, HE CLAIMED, IS A "MUCH MORE FIRMLY AND WIDELY BASED ORGANIZATION."  ------------------------------- KDPI BASE OF SUPPORT -------------------------------  8.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE HAS 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS AND "CANNOT HANDLE" ANY MORE THAN THAT FOR LOGISTICAL JEXNSJM  WHENEVER HE NEEDS, HE CAN CALL UP "SEVERAL MULTIPLES" OF THAT FIGURE.  HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAS NO REAL COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE AMONG IRANIAN KURDS ("80 PERCENT ARE BEHIND ME") AND HE SCOFFED AT THE SITUATION IN IRAQ:  "THERE IS NOTHING SIMILAR IN IRAN TO A (KURDISH) TAHA MA'RUF AS 'VICE PRESIDENT' OR THE KURDS THAT HOLD MINISTRIES HERE.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE HUGE NUMBERS OF 'JAHASH'" (THE PEJORATIVE TERM FOR THE KURDISH TRIBAL FORCES HELD BY VHENIRAIE (##) --AND THUS BECOME SOMETHING EQUIVALENT TO THE "JAHASH.").  9.  IN HIS APPEAL FOR AMERICAN "MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT," QASSEMLU STRESSED THAT HE WAS NOT CALLING FOR MONEY OR ARMS.  "OF COURSE ONE ALWAYS LIKES MORE, BUT WE HAVE PLENTY."  HE CLAIMED THAT THE KDPI HAS, OVER THE YEARS, BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AMPLE ARMS FROM THE IRANIAN URMY/PASDARAN.  HE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO INTO HIS FINANCIAL SOURCES, CLAIMING ONLY THAT "EVERY FAMILY IN KURDISTAN MAKES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS," BUT IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION IT BECAME CLEAR THAT BOTH THE KDPI AND PUK SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN LARGE PART THROUGH SMUGGLING.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE "ONLY" CJARGES A "THREE PERCENT DUTY" ON GOODS PASSING FROM IRAQ INTO IRAN, AS OPPOSED TO "AS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT" LEVIED BY TALABANI.  EXAMPLES OF GOODS GOING INTO IRAN INCLUDE WHISKEY AND VIDEOS AND OF GOODS GOING INTO IRAQ, CARPETS AND PISTACHIOS.  FORMERLY TEA CAME FROM IRAQ AND SUGAR FROM IRAN, BUT LATELY BOTH TEA AND SUGAR HAVE BEEN MOVING FROM IRAQ INTO IRAN.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY ASKED TALABANI HOW LONG HE COULD SURVIVE FINANCIALLY IF HIS MONETARY SOURCES SUDDENLY DRIED UP, AND TALABANI SAID, "TWO MONTHS," WHEREAS QASSEMLU CLAIMED HE WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY GOING ON FOR "AT LEAST TWO YEARS."  10.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN AS "STABLE," I.E., MUCH THE SAME AS IT HAS XBEEN FINCE 1980 WHEN THE KDPI LOST ITS CONTROL OVER THE CITIES AND CHANGED FROM CONVENTIONAL WARFARE TO GUERRILLA TACTICS.  THE IRANIANS CONTROL THE CITIES VNOW BUT ONLY CONTROL THE MAIN HIGHWAYS FROM EIGHT TO FVE; TE KDPI TACES OVER AT NIGHT.  QASSEMLU PRO' XFESSED TO BE "OPTIMISTIC" ABOUT THE FUTURE, SINCE HIS SUPPORT IN IRANIN KURDISTAN IS "ROCK-SOLID."  HE SAID THAT HE ISHPREPARED TO HOLD OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR 25 YEARS, BUT IF KHOMEINI DIES SOON "THERE MAY BE CONSIDERABLE TURMOIL IN TEHRAN," AND THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS "IN A TAILSPIN."  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE OR TALABANI AND BARZANI CONTROLLED MORE TERRAIN, QASSEMLU SAID THAT THREE YEARS AGO HE DID, BUT NOW THE IRAQI KURDS DO.  THE REASON, HE EXPLAINED, IS NOT THAT HE IS DOING WORSE--TO THE CONTRARY HE IS HLDING HIS OWN--IT IS RATHER THAT THE SITUATION FOR THE BAGHDAD REGIME IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS "DETERIOKA- TED SO SHARPLY" OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. (#) CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING TALABAMI AND SADDAM TOGETHER FOR PROLONGED NEGOTIA- TIOS TH YEARS AGO, WHICH BROKE DOWN.  -------------------------------------- COMPELLED TO MOVE HEADPUARTERS --------------------------------------  11.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN OBLIGED TO MOVE HIS HEADQUARTERS.BECAUSE OF INTENSE IRANIAN SHELLING.  HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS--HE POINTED OUT ON AN UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY DETAILED MAP--APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NEAR THE LESSER ZAB RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS INTO IRAQ (APPROXIMATELY 3601N 4520E).  HE HAD HAD A LARGE HOSPI- TAL TYERE TO WHICH FRENCH DOCTORS CAME EVERY MONTH, AND OFTEN THE KDPI WAS PUT IN THE ANOMOLOUS SITUATION OF HAVING BOTH TALABANI AND IRAQI ARMY CASUALTIES AT THE HOSPITAL AT THE SAME TIME.  THE LOCALS BECAME UNTENABLE BECAUSE THE IRANIAN ARMY WAS JUST TO THE EAST, THE IRAQI ARMY JUST TO THE WEST, AND TALABANI'S FORCES BEHIND THE IRAQI ARMY FURTHER TO THE WEST--"EVERYBODY WAS POUNDING EVERYBODY."  NOW HE HAS MOVED TO A POINT (APPROXIMATELY 3620N 4515E) SOME THIRTY-FIVE KILOMETERS TO THE NORTH, AGAIN RIGHT ON THE IRANIAN BORDER SO THAT QASSEMLU SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME ON THE IRANIAN SIDE (HE CLAIMS), BUT WHERE THE IRAQI ARMY IS MUCH FURTHER AWAY TO ZHE WEST.  THUS, HIS HEADQUARTERS NOW APPEARS TO BE IN A KIND OF NO-MAN'S-LAND WHERE THE KDPI HAS FULL SWAY. HE SAYS HE HAS REBUILT THE HOSPITAL THERE AND THE FRENCH DOCTORS CONTINUE TO COME.  12.  ON FIGHTING AT MAWAT ON THE GOGASUR RIVER JUST TO THE SOUTH OF WHERE HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS WAS, QASSEMLU SAID THAT THE IRANIAN OBJECTIVE IS TO CLEAR TALABANI'S EAST-WEST ACCESS.  TALABANI'S HEADQUARTERS, HE CLAIMED, IS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF MAWAT (SOMEWHERE VAGUELY IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHILER RIVER WHICH MEETS THE GOGASUR SOUTH OF MAWAT, APPROXIMATELY AT 3547N 4540E).  THE IRANIANS CONTROL THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING MAWAT TO THE EAST, THE IRAQIS CONTROL THE HILLS SOUTHWEST OF MAWAT, AND THERE HAS BEEN MUCH FIGHTING THERE AND IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST OF MAWAT WHICH THE IRANIANS PARTIALLY CONTROL. JUST THAT MORNING QASSEMLU RECEIVED A CALL FROM HIS HEADQUARTERS THAT THE IRAQIS HAD JUST LAUNCHED A NEW ATTACK ON THE IRANIAN POSITIONS WEST OF MAWAT.  MAWAT ITSELF, "LIKE PANJWIN," QASSEMLU COMMENTED, IS COMPLETELY ABANDONED.  -------------------------------- RELATIONS WITH TALABANI --------------------------------  13.  QASSEMLU CLAIMED TO BE "VERY GOOD FRIENDS" WITH TALABANI.  RECENTLY HE HAD ASKED TALABANI TO PICK UP SOME CAVIAR FOR HIM FROM THE CASPIAN, AND WHEN TALABANI BROUGHT IT TO HIM HE JOKED THAT HE HAD HAD TO GO THROUGH SPECIAL CHANNELS TO GET MORE CAVIAR THAN IS NOW USUALLY PERMITTED AND IF THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES HAD KNOWN WHOM IT WAS FOR "THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN APOPLECTIC." QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN DELICATE ISSUES ARISE.  FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY 52 IRAQI SOLDIERS, INCLUDING SIX OFFICERS, HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THE KDPI AND TALABANI HAD DEMANDED THAT THEY BE HANDED OVER. THE DISPUTE WENT ON FOR TWO WEEKS BUT QASSEMLU WAS ADAMANT THAT THE KDPI MUST REMAIN "ABSOLUTELY NEUTRAL" IN ALL MATTERS BETWEEN IRAQIS AND KURDS, AND HE EVENTU- ALLY HANDED THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS BACK TO THE IRAQI ARMY.  QASSEMLU, WHO WHILE BEING REMARKABLY OPEN ALSO TENDED TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS CAREFULLY, WAS UNWILL- ING TO BE DRAWN OUT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MAS'UD BARZANI, BUT HE RIDICULED THE IDEA THAT THE BARZANIS' "KDP" WAS EVER "A REAL PARTY."  "THEY ARE MERELY A TRIBE."  ---------------------------------- SADDAM IS IN CHARGE ----------------------------------  14.  QASSEMLU WAS UNWILLING TO DISCUSS HIS MEETING WLTH SADDAM, INDEED EVEN DIRECTLY TO ADMIT IT TOOK PLACE (ALTHOUGH PRIVATELY TO THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR HE HAD BEEN MORE CANDID), ALTHOUGH HE DID ALLUDE TO THE PERSIAN SAYING THAT "IF YOU CAN MEET GOD, THERE IS NO POINT IN SETTLING FOR ONE OF THE TWELVE IMAMS." QASSEMLU SAID THAT, UNLIKE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ LEADER RAJAVI, HE HAD "ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE" TO BE PHOTO- GRAPHED WITH SADDAM OR HAVE ANY PUBLICITY OF HIS TRAVEL TO BAGHDAD, MUCH LESS OF MEETING SADDAM--"IT DOES NOT GO OVER VERY WELL IN IRAN."  POLCHIEF PRESSED HIM ON WHO IN IRAQ IS IN CHARGE OF KURDISH ISSUES, AND QASSEMLU SAID, "SADDAM.  HE IS IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING." THAT ASIDE, HOWEVER, HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IN DAY-TO- DAY AFFAIRS, "THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN IRAQ: SADDAM; 'ADNAN (KHAYRALLAH, MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND FIRST COUSIN AND BGOTHER-IN-LAW OF SADDAM), WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE SOUTH; AND 'ALI HASAN (AL-MAJID, PATER- NAL COUSIN AND LOOK-ALIKE OF SAWAAV0| WHO IS IN UHAR3 RGFITHE NORTH."  HOWEVER, QASSEMLU INDICATED HE DID NOT SEE 'ALI HASAN, HEADQUARTERED IN KIRKUK, VERY OFTEN, APPARENTLY BECAUSE QASSEMLU NEVER SETTLES FOR LESS THAN "GOD."  -------------------------------- VILLAGE DESTRUCTION --------------------------------  15.  POLCHIEF ASKED QASSEMLU FOR HIS REACTION TO THE IRAQI CAMPAIGN OF DESTROYING KURDISH VILLAGES. QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT "MOST" VILLAGES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BUT HE SEEMED UNEMOTIONAL ON THE POINT. POLCHIEF ASKED IF THE CAMPAIGN HAD HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS AND REFUGEES.  HE ANSWERED THAT IT HAD "GREATLY" INCREASED THE NUMBER OF UERRILLAS BUT NEITHER HE NOR TALABANI ENCOURAGED THE IDEA OF REFUGEES INTO THE OTHER'S TERRITORY, BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FEEDING AND CARING FOR PEOPLE.  THE NET EFFECT OF THE IRAQI VILLAGE DES- TRUCTION CAMPAIGN, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, IS THE ALMOST COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE IRAQI KURDS' TRADITIONAL AGRARIAN WAY OF LIFE.  KURDISH MEN IN IRAQ HAVE ONLY TWO CHOICES, TO GO TO THE CITIES OR TO STAY: IN NEWLY CONSTRUCTED CENTERS WHERE THE ONLY LIVELIHOOD IS TO BE "JAHASH."  QASSEMLU SAID THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE SO FAR ONLY DESTROYED 25 VILLAGES, OUT OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN (AND A CLAIMED KURDISH POPULATION IN IRAN OF SEVEN MILLION), BUT HE COMMENTED, "ALAS, EACH SIDE TENDS TO LEARN BAD HABITS FROM THE OTHER."   ONE BAD HABIT THAT HE CLAIMED THE IRANIANS HAVE (#) IS THE USE OF CHEMICUL WEAPONS.  "BOTH SIDES DO IT, ALTHOUGH THE IRAQIS MUCH MORE."  POLCHIEF ASKED WHETHER, GIVEN THE DENUDED NATURE OF MOST OF KURDISTAN, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER AIRBORNE ATTACKS POSE A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE PESHMERGA.  QASSEMLU SAID, "NEITHER WE NOR THE IRAQI KURDS ARE WORRIED ABOUT HELICOPTERS.  WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM.  BUT ARTILLERY IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR US.  AND CHEMICAL WARFARE IS A PROBLEM TOO."  ----------------------------- A KURD'S VIEW OF IRAQ -----------------------------  16.  QASSEMLU DID NOT GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO CRITICIZE IRAQ, BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST A BARRAGE OF CUTTING REMARKS THAT CLEARLY SHOWED HIS DISDAIN FOR ARABS AND FOR THE IRAQI REGIME.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID THAT HE VERY MUCH DISLIKED BAGHDAD AND AVOIDED COMING UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. HE GRUDGINGLY ADMITTED THAT IRAN IS A MORE FLUID AND DYNAMIC SOCIETY--"YES, IN URMIA PEBPLE CAN PICKIUP THE PHONE TO THE UNITED STATES ANY TIME THEY WANT, AND THEY ARE FREE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY," HE SAID WISTFULLY --BUT HE WAS QUICK TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS MUCH LESS INTERFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S PRIVATE MORALS IN IRAQ AND THAT IRAQ STANDS FOR "MORE MODERN IDEAS."  HE HAD DETESTED THE SHAH, "BUT KHOMEINI IS MUCH WORSE."  HE HAD SEEN KHOMEINI TWICE IN 1979 AND BEEN "LIED TO SHAMELESSLY."  QASSEMLU PROCEEDED TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THE SHI'A PRACTICE OF "TAQIYA" (DECEIT TO SERVE A HIGHER PURPOSE) AS AN PNGRAINED PART OF THE SHI'A PERSONALITY; POLCHIEF NOTED THAT WE HAD RECENTLY LEARNED A FEW LDSSONS ON THE SUBJECT OURSELVES.  ------------------------ RAJAVI -------------------------  17.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE KDPI IS IN NEED OF ALLIANCES WITH OTHER IRANIAN OPVBSITION GROUPS, SINCE BY ITSELF IT OBVIOUSLY CANNOT OVERTHROW THE REGIME.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE REGIME HAS WIDE SUVPORT ("HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MULLAHS WHO ALL SEE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AT STAKE") AND ITS OVERTHROW WILL BE NO EASY MATTER.  POL- CHIEF ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE ALLIANCE WITH RAJAVI WHO, IN ANY CASE, HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN  MOUNTING MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE NORTH.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED RAJAVI AS AN "AMATEUR," WHO HAS 1200 FIGHTERS "AT THE MOST" BUT HAS A GOOD PROPAGANDA MACHINE.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI "HAD TRIED A FEW ACTIONS IN THE NORTH," BUT UNLIKE THE KDPI THE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ "HAVE NO REAL STRENGTH IN PLACE IN IRAN."  "IN FACT, OF ALL THE OPPOSITION GROUPS," QASSEMLU CLAIMED, "ONLY MY PARTY HAS SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH INSIDE IRAN."   QASSEMLU SAID THATSRAJAVI'S RECENT ACTIONS IN THE NORTH HAD CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR THE KDPI, BECAUSE IT HAD ON OCCASION ENGAGED TALABANI'S FORCES. QASSEMLU SAID THAT HENCEFORTH RAJAVI WILL NOT BE OPERATING IN THE NORTH BUT HAS NOW SWITCHED TO THE SOUTH.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI "IS APPARENTLY NOT EAGER FOR ANY ALLIANCES."  "RAJAVI HAS VISIONS OF GRANDEUR; HE THINKS HE IS ABLE TO CARRY IT BY HIMSELF."  ------------------------------- KDPI CONGRESS -------------------------------  18.  IN AN ASIDE, THE KDPI PARIS REPRESENTATIVE (WHO WITH HIS COLLEAGUE IN STOCKHOLM WAS TO RETURN TO EUROPE FEBRUARY 15) SAID THAT "APPROXIMATELY 200" PARTY REPRESENTATIVES HAD APPEARED FOR THE CONGRESS, HELD AT THE NEW PARTY HEADQUARTERS.  THE CONGRESS HAD ALWAYS PREVIOUSLY BEEN BIENNIAL, BUT BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES FACED BY MANY OF THE PARTY MEMBERS IN MAKING THE JOURNEY FROM OUTLYING PARTS OF IRANIAN KURDISTAN OVER THE BORDER TO THE HEADQUARTERS IN IRAQ, IT HAS NOW BEEN DECIDED NOT TO HAVE THE NEXT CONGRESS FOR THREE YEARS.  QASSEMLU, WHILE REPEATEDLY STRESSING THE DEMOCRATIC NATURE OF HIS PARTY AND ITS POLICIES  (AND HE CLARIFIED THAT HE MEANT "DEMOCRATIC" IN THE WESTERN RATHER THAN EASTERN SENSE), ADMITTED THAT HE HAD HAD NO OPPONENT FOR POSITION OF SECRETARY GENERAL.  POLCHIEF ASKED WHETHER ANY KDPI REPRESENTA- TIVES FROM THE U.S. HAD PARTICIPATED, AND THE REPLY WAS THAT WHILE ONE HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS, NONE CAME THIS  TIME.  ------------------------------------ KOMALA ------------------------------------  19.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR DISPLAYED CONSTERNATION THAT TWO WEEKS AGO HE HAD GIVEN A PROMINENT IRANIAN KURDISH FIGURE, SHAYH 'IZZ AL-DIN HUSAYNI, A TOURIST VISA TO SWEDEN, AND NOW HE IS ASKING FOR ASYLUM.  THE VISA HAD BEEN REQUESTED ON HIS BEHALF BY HIS SON-IN-LAW, NAMED CHAMSI, THE BAGHDADREPRESENTATIVE OF KOMALA (SMALL MARXIST IRANIAN KURDISH GROUP).  QASSDMLU DISCOUNTED SHAYKH HUSAYNI'S RELIGIOUS IMPBRTANCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF KOMALA.  ----------------------------- BIOGRAPHICS -----------------------------  20.  QASSEMLU (GHASSEMLOU) WAS BORN IN 1930.  HIS EARLY EDUCATION WAS IN URMIA BUT HE ALSO ATTENDED THE AMERICAN COLLEGE IN TEHRAN.  HE WENT TO UNIVERSITY IN PARIS BUT WAS EXPELLED FROM IRAN (#) REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES. HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE, AND HE WAS AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN PRAGUE FOR TWENTY YEARS.  HE DEPARTED WHEN THE SOVIETS MARCHED IN IN 1968.  OFF AND ON DURING THE 1970S HE SERVED AS AN ECONOMIST IN THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING IN BAGHDAD, DURING WHICH HE AUTHORED A MAJOR OVERALL ECONOMIC PLAN FOR IRAQ, HE CLAIMS.  OF MEDIUM HEIGHT AND SLENDER BUILD, HIS HAIR IS GRAYING BUT HE MOVES WITH THE QUICKNESS AND AGILITY OF A YOUNGER MAN.  HE TELLS A GOOD ANECDOTE AND PEPPERS HIS CONVERSATION WITH CONSTANT HUMOR.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 01097  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, PGOV, IZ, TU SUBJECT:  KURDISH INSURGENCY IN IRAQ AND TURKEY  1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT)  2.  SUMMARY:  TRAINING CAMPS FOR PKK IN IRAN ARE A GROWING WORRY FOR TURKEY AND, ACCORDING TO TURKISH AMBASSADOR, HAVE BEEN A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN RECENT IRANIAN-TURKISH MEETINGS.  BARZANI'S KDP, APPARENTLY IN SOME DISARRAY, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REIN IN THE PKK, WHICH HAS ACTIVELY BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH TALABANI'S PUK.  THE TURKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE DELIVERY OF WEAPONS TO PKK BY THE IRAQIS. END SUMMARY.  3.  ACCORDING TO TURKISH AMBASSADOR KOKSAL, ONE OF THE TOP  ITEMS ON THE AGENDA DURING THE IRANIAN MINISTER OF INTERIOR'S RECENT VISIT TO ANKARA WAS IRANIAN SUPPORT OF THE PKK INSURGENTS BY PROVIDING THEM TRAINING CAMPS IN IRAN AND BY ASSISTING THEM IN THEIR IRAQI SANCTUARIES.  (ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY, KOKSAL SAID, WAS THE PROBLEM OF THE LARGE IRANIAN REFUGEE POPULATION.)  IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PKK IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS ONLY BEEN NOTICED OVER THE PAST YEAR, AS THE IRANIAN EMPHASIS PREVIOUSLY WAS IN SUPPORTING FUNDAMENTALIST POLITICAL PARTIES IN TURKEY.  THESE NEVER GARNERED SUFFICIENT POPULAR ENTHUSIASM, SO THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO BE TRYING A NEW TACTIC.  4.  KOKSAL SAID THAT, DESPITE ASSURANCES TO TURKEY THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE ANY AID TO THE PKK, ELEMENTS OF MASOUD BARZANI'S KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAQ HAVE BEEN AIDING THE PKK, EVEN AS OTHERS OF ITS ELEMENTS ARE BEING ATTACKED BY THE PKK.  KOKSAL ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO MASOUD'S POOR CONTROL OVER HIS DISORGANIZED FORCES.  IN A SEPARATE CON- VERSATION, TURKISH DCM OKCUN OBSERVED THAT THE KDP HAS "FALLEN INTO SOME DISARRAY" FOLLOWING IDRIS BARZANI'S DEATH ONE YEAR AGO.  MASOUD HAD APPARENTLY EVEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL PKK INSURGENTS, IN CONFORMITY WITH HIS "UNDERSTANDING" WITH A TURKISH GENERAL IN COMMAND IN EASTERN TURKEY TO "SHUT OUT" THE PKK, BUT MASOUD "CANNOT DISCIPLINE HIS OWN PEOPLE."  5.  OKCUN SAID THAT APO ACALAN (HEAD OF PKK, RESIDENT IN SYRIA) HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH JALAL TALABANI, HEAD OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN (PUK), PRESUMABLY THROUGH SOME SYRIAN INTERMEDIATION AND IMPETUS.  TALABANI IS SEEKING GREATER STATUS AS "THE PREEMINENT KURDISH LEADER" AND THUS WANTS THE PKK AS AN ALLY, BUT ONLY IF THE PKK BEHAVES ITSELF. ACCORDING TO OKCUN, TALABANI ALSO IS LOOKING TOWARD A TIME WHEN THE PKK WILL BE HELPFUL TO HIM IN MOVING AGAINST BARZANI.  THE ELEMENTS OF THE TALABANI- ACALAN AGREEMENT SEEM TO BE:  -- CESSATION, FOR THE TIME BEING, OF PKK ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS,  -- CESSATION OF PKK ASSASSINATIONS OF OTHER KURDS, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE,  -- TURNING AGAINST THE KDP IN FULL FORCE, BUT NOT UNTIL "THE TIME IS RIPE."  OKCUN OBSERVED THAT IT IS ODD THAT THE PKK IS CULTI- VATING THE PUK, WHOSE TRADITIONAL AREA OF OPERATION IS AROUND SULAYMANIYYA AND NOT ALONG THE IRAQI- TURKISH BORDER WHICH IS KEY TO THE PKK, BUT HE ASSUMED THAT THE          IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE ANGER AT MASOUD'S PRESSURE ON THE PKK AND MASOUD'S INCREASING LACK OF CONTROL WHICH ALLOWS THE PKK TO USE BASES IN KDP TERRITORY DESPITE ENMITY WITH MASOUD.  OKCUN SAID THAT IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED DECREASE IN PKK ATTACKS, EVEN ON JANDARMA, AND HE GAVE CREDIT TO THE PUTATIVE ACALAN-TALABANI- SYRIAN AGREEMENT.  6.  OKCUN ADDED THAT A NEW WORRISOME ELEMENT HAS EMERGED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS:  USE BY THE PKK OF NEW WEAPONRY OBTAINED FROM THE IRAQIS.  THE TURKS, OKCUN SAID, HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THESE WEAPONS HAVE NOT BEEN CAPTURED, SINCE THEY ARE IN SERIAL SEQUENCE AND NEW.  THE TURKS HAVE NOT RAISED THE ISSUE YET WITH THE IRAQIS, IN HOPES THAT IT WILL TURN OUT TO HAVE  BEEN A LIMITED ARRANGEMENT. (ASKED WHY THE IRAQIS WOULD RISK HARMING ITS KEY RELATIONAHIP WITH TURKEY--AFTER ALL, NEITHER STATE IS BLESSED WITH AN OVERABUNDANCE OF FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS-- OKCUN MUSED THAT "ALL THESE COUNTRIES"--SYRIA, IRAN, AND IRAQ--ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PUTTING ON PRESSURE THROUGH RUNDERHANDED, VIOLENT MEANS:  "IT IS IN THEIR CHARACTER," WAS HIS VIEW.)  7.  COMMENT:  THE HISTORY OF KURDS, AT LEAST IN IRAQI KURDISTAN, IS THAT PPWE THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT NON-KURDISH OUTSIDERS THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY FIGHT EACH OTHER.  THE CURRENT PKK-KDP SITUATION AND FREQUENT KDP-PUK FUEDS ILLUSTRATE THIS CONSTANT OF IRAQI KURDISH POLITICS.   NEWTON 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 01177  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS:  PREL IZ SUBJECT: THE REGIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM  1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT)  2.  SUMMARY.  IRAQI MORALE IS AT A LOW POINT, ALTHOUGH IRAQIS REMAIN AS WEARILY DETERMINED AS EVER NOT TO LOSE THE WAR.  SEVERAL RECENT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS -- RENEWED POPULAR ARMY RECRUITING, THE EX POST FACTO CANCELLATION OF AN AMNESTY FOR DESERTERS, AND THE BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE -- ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIP.  EROSION OF LIVING STANDARDS THROUGH INFLATION REMAINS A SERIOUS LONG TERM PROBLEM.  THE RECENT MISSILE EXCHANGE HAS ADDED TO CIVILIAN FEARS. IT HAS ALSO GIVEN A BOOST TO THE MORALE OF SOME TO SEE IRAQ ABLE TO STRIKE BACK AT TEHRAN, BUT THIS POSITIVE EFFECT WILL DISSIPATE IF THE EXCHANGE CONTINUES VERY LONG.  OFFICIAL BRAVADO IS A RESULT OF LOCAL MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO BOOST SAGGING HOME-FRONT MORALE.  END SUMMARY.  3.  IN THE OPINION OF THE AMBASSADOR, CIVILIAN MORALE IN BAGHDAD IS CURRENTLY LOWER THAN AT ANY TIME DURING HIS THIRTY-NINE MONTHS AT POST.  WHILE THE QUESTION MAY NOT BE CRITICAL FOR IRAQ, SINCE IRAQIS SOMEHOW DO AND MUST KEEP ON WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES IN THE FACE OF OFFICIAL COMPULSION AND POSSESS A GENUINE IF WEARY DETERMINATION NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY A DESPISED IRANIAN REGIME, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN IS MORE ANGUISHING NOW THAN IN RECENT MEMORY.  4.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE IRAQIS, MUCH OF THE ADDED BURDEN ON MORALE IS DUE DECISIONS AND MISCALCULATIONS BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING:  -- 1) A MAJOR REAPPEARANCE OF POPULAR ARMY PRESS GANGS AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A YEAR.  ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE REGIME IS RAISING UNITS TO REPLACE KURDISH TRIBAL IRREGULAR UNITS DOING GARRISON AND REAR-AREA PATROL DUTY, SINCE THESE UNITS ARE CONSIDERED EVEN LESS RELIABLE IN THE WAKE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF KURDISH VILLAGES.  (THE STREET RUMOR IS THAT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE NEW PA FORCES WILL GO NORTH TO KURDISTAN;ONE FOURTH TO GUARD PIPELINE.)  MIDDLE-AGED BAGHDADIS REALLY FEAR DUTY IN KURDISTAN, EXPECTING TO HAVE THEIR THROATS CUT IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. ANOTHER EXPLANATION IS THAT AFTER A YEAR OF RECRUITING INACTIVITY, MANY PA UNITS ARE DUE TO BE DEMOBILIZED AFTER THEIR FOURTEEN MONTHS DUTY PERIOD AND MUST NOW BE REPLACED WHOLESALE.  -- 2) THE EX POST FACTO CANCELLATION BY SADDAM OF THE LAST AMNESTY DECLARED IN JANUARY.  MANY IRAQIS ACCUSE THE REGIME OF LURING DESERTERS IN TO SENTENCE THEM TO PRISON AND SOME TO EXECUTION.  THIS PERCEIVED DOUBLE-DEALING HAS HARMED THE REGIME'S ALREADY POOR CREDIBILITY WITH ITS OWN PEOPLE.  -- 3) THE BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE CANCELLED IN LATE FEBRUARY.  THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARACTERISTIC FAILURE TO EXPLAIN ITSELF AND THE POPULATION'S USUAL PENCHANT FOR WILD RUMORS IN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF RELIABLE INFORMATION SOWED REAL PANIC, WITH RUMORS OF IMPENDING NUCLEAR ATTACK, CHEMICAL WARFARE, AND FLOODING DUE TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE SADDAM TIGRIS DAM NEAR MOSUL.  5.  A LONGER TERM SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR IRAQIS REMALNS THE STEADY EROSION OF THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING THROUGH STEADY INFLATION IN THE FACE OF A NINE-YEAR GOVERNMENT WAGE FREEZE AND THE DRAFTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF WORKING MALE FAMILY MEMBERS.  A HIGH GOVERNMENT MONTHLY SALARY OF 250 DINARS (800 DOLLARS AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, 125 AT THE BLACK MARKET AND REAL VALUE RATE) BUYS LITTLE WHEN MEAT ON THE BONE COSTS NINE DINARS A KILO AND A KILO OF FRUITS OR VEGETABLES TWO TO THREE DINARS.  6.  ONE NOTICEABLE RESULT OF THESE CURRENT PRESSURES HAS BEEN THE GROWING NUMBER OF BAGHDADIS MOVING THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF THE CITY OR MAKING ALTERNATIVE EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ELSEWHERE. THE EVACUATION EXERCISE AND THE LATEST MISSILE EXCHANGE WITH IRAN HAVE ACCELERATED THIS TREND.  (THE AMBASSADOR'S NEAREST NEIGHBOR, ONE OF IRAQ'S RICHEST BUSINESSMEN, HAS DECAMPED TO MOSUL AND POORER PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES ELSEWHERE.)  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY WHOLESALE FLIGHT, BUT TRAFFIC IN BADHDAD IS CURRENTLY NOTICEABLY LIGHTER THAN USUAL.  7.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE WILL BE.  FOR MANY, IF NOT MOST, IT HAS MEANT FEAR.  OTHERS ARE PLEASED TO SEE IRAQ AT LAST ABLE TO RESPOND IN KIND AND IN FORCE TO PREVIOUS IRANIAN SCUD ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD AND HOPE IT WILL FRIGHTEN IRAN FROM FURTHER ATTACKS.  IF, AS WE WOULD EXPECT, IRAN RESPONDS INSTEAD WITH MORE SCUDS, THESE LATTER PEOPLE WILL LIKELY LOSE THIS OPTIMISTIC INTERPRETATION.  FINALLY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING A NORMALLY PACIFIC MFA SOURCE, ARGUE THAT IRAQ SHOULD ENCOURAGE A MAJOR IRANIAN ATTACK SINCE THE IRAQI ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER, ITS MORALE BETTER, WHILE THE IRANIANS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MOBILIZING. WE PUT THIS VIEW DOWN TO OFFICIAL BRAVADO ARISING OUT OF A RESURGENCE OF IRAQI MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO COMBAT SAGGING HOME-FRONT MORALE.   NEWTON

NOW THAT THE WAR OF THE CITIES HAS RESUMED (REGARDLESS OF WHO ACTUALLY STARTED IT), THE IRAQIS APPEAR TO FEEL THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1980-81 THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE OVER IRAN.  ALTHOUGH UNDERSECRETARY HAMDOON ARGUED TO ME YESTERDAY THAT IRAQ WANTS TO ASSURE MUTUAL DETERRENCE AGAINST HITTING THE TWO CAPITALS, THE IRAQIS ARE SHOWING NONE OF THE MEASURED RESPONSE SUCH A GOAL WOULD IMPLY.  RATHER THEY HAVE FIRED NINETEEN MISSILES TO DATE, NAMED BY THEM PROVOCATIVELY THE "HUSSEIN" AFTER SHIA ISLAM'S MOST HOLY FIGURE, AND, EVEN MORE PROVOCATIVELY, HAVE FIRED THE LATEST ONE AGAINST THE HOLY CITY OF QUM.  3.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IRAQIS SEE THIS STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE AND ARE PRESSING IT HOME.  IF THEY HAVE STOCKPILED A LARGE SUPPLY OF MISSILES (WE ASSUME BUT DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE SOVIET SS-12'S), THEY HAVE BADLY OUTGUNNED THE IRANIANS WHO HAVE ONLY A LIMITED SUPPLY OF OBSOLETE, SLOW-RELOADING SCUD B'S WITH A FEW LAUNCHERS.  THE IRAQIS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE ON THE GROUND.  IRAN IS NOT READY FOR AN ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTH.  IF IT IS GOADED TO ATTACK WITH WHAT THEY HAVE, THEY FACE ALMOST CERTAIN DEFEAT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRONG COUNTER-ATTACK FROM IRAQ.  THE WINDOW FOR ATTACKING IS RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT FOR IRAN, SINCE THE PRIME WINTER IAPYJV  S PQMF AILL BE OVER BY THE END OF THIS MONTH, HARDLY ENOUGH TIME EVEN IF A NEW RECRUITING OF BASIJ STIMULATED BY THE MISSILE ATTACKS BEGINS IMMEDIATELY.  4.  THE IRAQ MOTIVE IN FORCING AN ESCALATION OF THE FIGHTING IS CLEARLY TO MAKE IRAN GIVE UP ITS WAR AIMS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE INITIAL AIR RAIDS ON KHARG ISLAND THREE YEARS AGO, IRAQ SENSES THAT IT REALLY HAS THE ABILITY TO FORCE AN END TO HOSTILITIES, RATHER THAN JUST TO REACT.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS NOT LIKELY TO LISTEN TO APPEALS TO EASE OFF.  5.  OUR CONDEMNATION OF BOTH SIDES FOR ATTACKING CIVILIAN TARGETS WAS JUST RIGHT.  I BELIEVE THAT, IF THE ATTACKS GO ON ANOTHER DAY, WE SHOULD GO BEYOND THE CONDEMNATION AND PRASS IRWY TT BE-ESCALATE.  I AM NOT SANGUINE THAT THEY WILL LISTEN, SINCE THEY SEE A VITAL OPPORTUNITY AND THEIR RECORD FOR LISTENING TO OUR UNWELCOME ADVICE IS NOT ENCOURAGING.  BUT IN THE INTEREST OF OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A QUICK PEACEFUL END TO THIS CONFLICT AND ABOVE ALL TO AVOID THE DANGERS OF AN INTENSIFIED WAR, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE THE EFFORT.  NEWTON

IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 19, MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTOR QAYSI DISCUSSED THE BRIEFING ON FAO GIVEN BY FONMIN AZIZ TO HIS SENIOR STAFF THAT MORNING.  3.  AZIZ TOLD HIS PEOPLE THAT THE DECISION TO RETAKE FAO WAS MADE LAST FALL UNDER ELABORATE SECRECY WHEN THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP CONCLUDED THAT THE 598 PROCESS WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE UNLESS IRAQ GAVE IT A PUSH BY GAINING SOME MILITARY VICTORY. (THE DECISION TO PRESS AHEAD WITH STOCKPILING "HUSSEIN" MISSILES FOR MASSIVE USE WAS PROBABLY RELATED.).  IRAQ THEN ENGAGED IN A CAREFUL DECEPTION OPERATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CREATED A FULL- SCALE MODEL OF THE FAO SALT PANS FOR DETAILED PRACTICE OPERATIONS BY ITS UNITS.  WHEN THE TIME FOR THE OPERATION WAS NEAR, SADDAM, MINDEF KHAIRALLAH AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF MADE A WELL- PUBLISIZED VISITTO THE NORTH, BUT THEN SECRETLY JETTED IMMEDIATELY TO BASRA.  PREVIOUSLY SOME UNNEEDED ARMY UNITS IN THE SOUTH (WE RECALL REPORT- ING ON A FULL DIVISION) WERE MOVED NORTH IN DAYLIGHT TO DECEIVE THE IRANIANS FURTHER.  4.  IRAQI TROOPS JUMPED OFF AT 0625 MAY 17 ACCORDING TO AZIZ, AFTER DAWN WHEN IRANIAN UNITS WOULD HAVE BEGUN TO RELAX.  (AN ORDER TO LAUNCH THE ATTACK AT 2200 THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS PART OF THE DECEPTION). IRAQI UNITS ACHIEVED COMPLETE SURPRISE AND PENE- TRATED THE ENTIRE IRANIAN DEFENSES IN THE SALT PANS IN A GUDERIAN-STYLE OPERATION, LEAVING IT TO FOLLOWING UNITS TO MOP UP RESISTANCE WHILE THE TWO PINCERS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD AND THE SEVENTH CORPS JOINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OBSTACLE. IRAQI UNITS THEN ENTERED FAO THE MORNING OF MAY 18. AZIZ SAID THAT IRAQI CASUALTIES HAD BEEN MORE THAN REASONABLE FOR SUCH AN OPERATION AND CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN PLANNERS HAD ANTICIPATED.  AZIZ DID NOT GIVE  ANY IRANIAN CASUALTY FIGURES OR COMMENT HOW MANY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED.  5.  QAYSI SAID THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE ELATED BY THE NEWS WHICH HE AGREED WAS IRAQ'S GREATEST MILITARY SUCCESS SINCE 1980-81.  HE RECALLED A MEETING HE ATTENDED OF AZIZ WITH SHEVARDNADZE IN THE SUMMER OF 1986 IN MOSCOW AFTER THE FAO DEBACLE WHEN  THE SOVIET, TREATING AZIZ HUMILIATINGLY LIKE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEFEATED NATION, URGED HIM TO AGREE TO HALT THE WAR ON THE BASIS OF A CEASEFIRE IN PLACE.  AZIZ TOLD SHEVARDNADZE THAT IRAQ WOULD NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS THAN A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE WITH FULL WITHDRAWAL AND AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, BUT THE SOVIET FONMIN OBVIOUSLY DISMISSED THIS POSITION AS PURE PROPAGANDA.  NOW IRAQ WAS VINDICATED, QAYSI SAID WITH PRIDE, AND HAD SHOWN THAT IT ALWAYS MEANT WHAT IT SAID.  6.  IN A FINAL PURELY PERSONAL COMMENT, QAYSI GUESSED THAT IRAQ, FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS, MIGHT NOT BE FINISHED HITTING THE IRANIANS.  HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED, HE SAID, TO SEE A SIMILAR OPERATION IN THE FUTURE EAST OF BASRA.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT SUCH AN OPERATION STRAIGHT TOWARDS IRAN COULD BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN FAO.

WITH NEARLY THREE WEEKS ELAPSING SINCE THE END OF THE MISSILE WAR, IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT THE IRAQIS INTEND TO DO NO MORE THAN KEEP THE IRANIANS AWARE THAT THEIR "FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER" SHOULD THE IRANIANS TRY ANYTHING BIG, ALTHOUGH THE VALUE OF THE IRAQI WARNINGS IS GROWING INCREASINGLY HOLLOW.  END SUMMARY.  3.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RELENTING YET IN THE STRIDENCY OF IRAQI WARNINGS THAT IF THE IRANIANS DO NOT DESIST IN SHELLING BORDER CITIES AND "VIOLATING THE CONDI- IONS STIPULATED FOR THE HALT OF IRANIAN CITIES," IRAQ WILL METE OUT "SEVERE PUNISHMENT" (CLEAR REFER- ENCE TO RESUMPTION OF USE OF MISSILES).  THE ODD THING LS THAT IN THE PAST WEEK THE IRAQI MEDIA HAVE MENTION- ED ONLY TWO SUCH "BORDER CITIES"--DARBANDIKHAN (NEAR HALABJA) EVERY DY, AND ON ONE OCCASION ABUL-KHASIB (NEAR BASRA).  BOTH ARE ABANDONED AND BOTH SIT ASTRIDE IMPORTANT HIGHWAYS CLOSE TO IRANIAN LINES THAT ARE OBVIOUS TARGETS FOR IRANIAN ARTILLERY. (INDEED, IT IS ESSENTIAL FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT FOR IRAN TO TRY TO INTERDICT MOVEMENT ALONG BOTH HIGHWAYS.)  4.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS STRUCK THE SHIRAZ REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX ON MAY 4.  THE SUBSEQUENT MILITARY COMMUNIQUE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY INTEND TO CONTINUE HITTING SUCH ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR.  5.  OF PARTICULAR NOTE, AS WE OBSERVE FROM FBIS REPORTAGE OF IRANIAN BROADCASTS, IS THE FERVOR WITH WHICH THE IRANIANS DENY STRIKING ANY CIVILIAN TARGETS IN IRAQ--INCLUDING DENYING ANY SHELLING OF DARBANDIKHAN.  OUR AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES TELL US THAT TEHRAN IS JUST BEGINNING TO COME BACK TO LIFE FULLY.  THEIR EMBASSY IN TEHRAN ASSESSES THAT THE IRANIANS ARE EXTREMELY KEEN TO PREVENT A RESUMPTION OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE--UNTIL, THAT IS, IRAN FEELS ON A TECHNOLOGICAL PAR WITH IRAQ AND CAN DELIVER JUST AS STRONG BLOWS AGAINST BAGHDAD AS THE IRAQIS CAN AGAINST TEHRAN.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS HAVE ALSO BEEN KEEN TO DENY IRANIAN CLAIMS OF IRAQI STRIKES ON IRANIAN BORDER AREAS.  6.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ CONTINUES OFFICIALLY TO BUBBLE OVER WITH PLEASURE AT THE VICTORY AT FAO AND THE MIGHTINESS OF THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, NOW FOLLOWED BY THE ABBAS MISSILE OF A CLAIMED EVEN LONGER STRIKING POWER.  SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS MADE NO FEWER THAN FOUR VISITS TO AN EXHIBITION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRY COMMISSION, AND ON MAY 5 HE BESTOWED ON THE COMMIS- SION'S DIRECTOR--HIS SON-IN-LAW AND COUSIN HUSAYN KAMIL (JUST PROMOTED FROM COLONEL TO BRIGADIER)-- AND SEVERAL OF ITS STAFF "RAFIDAIN MEDALS FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE."  IN VIRTUALLY EVERY HIGH- LEVEL MILITARY MEETING SADDAM NOW HAS, HUSAYN KAMIL IS PHOTOGRAPHED AT HIS SIDE, ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER- IN-LAW AND COUSIN DEFENSE MINISTER ADNAN KHAYRALLAH. THE BIG NEWS IN THE PRESS MAY 8 WAS THE OFFICIAL DELIVERY BY PARTY NUMBER-TWO IZZAT IBRAHIM TO SADDAM OF HIS LATEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT, A MINIATURE OF THE HUSSEIN MISSILE FROM THE PEOPLE OF SALAH AL DIN (TIKRIT) PROVINCE.  THE BIG NEWS ON MAY 9 WAS SADDAM'S PRESIDING OVER DISCUSSION OF FINAL DESIGNS FOR A MONUMENT TO BE ERECTED AT THE BILAT AL-SHUHADA SCHOOL, DESTROYED BY AN IRANIAN MISSILE OCTOBER 13, AND HIS REVIEWING A HALL FULL OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS "GIVEN TO HIM BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE SHOWING THEIR JOY."  7.  SADDAM'S MAY 1 INTERVIEW WITH AN EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST SANA AL-SA'ID, WAS FINALLY PUBLISHED MAY 6 (SEE FBIS JNO70944).  SADDAM TYPICALLY PREFERS ARAB TO NON-ARAB JOURNALISTS, PARTLY OUT OF NATIONALISM AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY TEND TO ASK LESS DELICATE QUESTIONS.  SANA AL-SA'ID DID TRY A FEW INTERESTING QUESTIONS, BUT SADDAM DOGGEDLY DODGED THEM.  SHE TRIED TO GET HIM TO SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE ABOUT HOW FAO IS A HARBINGER OF ARAB VICTORY OVER JERUSALEM, BUT HE MEALY-MOUTHED ABOUT LACK OF ARAB UNITY AND PROBLEMS WITH WORLD OPINION.  SHE TRIED TO GET HIM TO CASTIGATE OMAN, QATAR, AND THE EMIRATES, BUT HE DID NOT BITE.  SHE INSINUATED SUPERPOWER UNHELP- FULNESS, BUT THERE WERE NO WORDS OF CRITICISM FOR THE SOVIET UNION, AND HE EXCUSED U.S. NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF AS BEING LONGSTANDING AND, IN ANY CASE, SOMETHING FOR WHICH IRAN IS ENTIRELY TO BLAME.  HE REFUSED TO BLAME THE PLO FOR RAP- PROCHEMENT WITH SYRIA.  HE LIED EFFUSIVELY ABOUT HOW THE IRAQIS NOW RELY ON THEMSELVES FOR MOST WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, ALTHOUGH HE DID CONTRADICTORILY ADMIT THAT "PURCHASES OF SOVIET ARMS ARE STILL BIG."  8.  ARAFAT, WHO ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD FROM DAMASCUS ON APRIL 26, IS STILL IN TOWN, GETTING PUBLICITY FOR HIS PROMINENCE IN SADDAM'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AND IN MEETINGS WITH SADDAM ON APRIL 27 AND MAY 7.  BE- TWEEN THESE DATES THERE WERE MEETINGS OF THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE HIGHER COMMITTEE FOR OCCUPIED LAND AFFAIRS.  PLO STATEMENTS AS PUBLISHED IN THE BAGHPAD PRESS ARE MAINLY DEVOTED TO PRAISE OF THE VICTORY AT FAO "LEADING TO VICTORY IN JERUSALEM."  9.  SAUDI ARABIA'S RUPTURE OF RELATIONS WITH IRAN HAS BEEN A MAJOR SOURCE OF PRAISE AMONG EDITORIALISTS, WITH A STRONG UNDERCURRENT THEME THAT OTHER ARAB STATES MUST FOLLOW SUIT.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TAHA YASIN RAMADAN, CARRYING SADDAM'S LETTER OF PRAISE FOR SAUDI ARABIA'S TOUGH STAND AGAINST IRAN, MET KING FAHD IN RIYADH MAY 6 AND MADE HIS SECOND UMRA TO MECCA IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS.  10.  COMMENT:  IN THE SHORT TERM, THERE IS HOPE FOR A CONTINUED LULL IN THE MISSILE WAR.  WHILE THE IRAQIS GREATLY RELISHED THE DISRUPTION IN TEHRAN, THEY ARE RESTRAINED BY COUNTERVAILING FACTORS. BAGHDAD WAS ALSO DISRUPTED, EVEN IF TO A MUCH RE- DUCED DEGREE THAN TEHRAN; BAGHDADIS WERE BEGINNING TO BE VERY MUCH ON EDGE.  THE IRAQIS MAY HAVE WORRIED ABOUT SUPPLY PROBLEMS; NO MATTER WHICH REPORT ONE BELIEVES, IRAQ'S SUPPLY OF MISSILES IS NOT LIMITLESS.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, THE IRAQIS MAY HAVE--OR SHOULD HAVE, BY ANY LOGIC-- CALCULATED THAT MISSILES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AS A DETERRENT IF NOT OVERUSED.  NOW THE IRANIANS PAINFULLY KNOW WHAT THE IRAQIS CAN DO, AND TEHRAN IS BEING REPOPULATED; HENCEFORTH, THE IRANIANS WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE CAREFULLY ABOUT THEIR ATTACKS ON THE GROUND OR WITH MISSILES.  11.  IN THE LONGER RUN, THE PICTURE MAY NOT BE SO HOPEFUL.  WE ARE IN A REGIONAL ARMS RACE, AND IF THE IRANIANS ARE ABLE TO CATCH UP, A DEADLIER MISSILE WAR MAY ULTIMATELY BE IN THE OFFING. IN THIS RACE, THE IRANIANS HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE OVER THE IRAQIS, NAMELY,  THAT BAGHDAD AND OTHER IRAQI POPULATION CENTERS LIE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES NEARER THE BORDER THAN DO MOST IRANIAN CITIES. THE IRANIANS THEREFORE ONLY NEED SMALLER MISSILES WHICH MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SPEEDIER PRODUCTION IN GREATER QUANTITY, OR IN THE CASE OF MISSILES OF SIMILAR SIZE AND PROPELLENT, THEY ARE ABLE TO PACK IN MUCH MORE EXPLOSIVES.  EITHER PROSPECT SHOULD GIVE THE IRAQIS PAUSE, AS THEY CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES ON THEIR NEW MISSILES.  NEWTON

SUMMARY: WE ARE SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY IRAQ NEWS AGENCY COMMENTARY, ALMOST CERTAINLY COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE PRESIDENCY, ACCUSING "IMPERIALIST POWERS" (I.E., UNITED STATES MOST OF ALL) OF PRESSING IRAN TO ACCEPT UNSCR 598 IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI'S COLLAPSE.  WE INTERPRET THIS BLUSTER AS SADDAM'S BULLYING WAY OF SAYING WHAT IS PATENTLY TRUE, THAT THE UPCOMING PERIOD WILL BE A TEST OF IRAQ'S RELA- TION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER EXTERNAL POWERS. END SUMMARY.  2. BAGHDAD TELEVISION, RADIO, AND ALL NEWSPAPERS AUGUST 18 PROMINENTLY CARRIED A VEHEMENT BUT MORE THAN USUALLY INARTICULATE EDITORIAL (REF FBIS), ATTRIBUTED TO THE POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE IRAQ NEWS AGENCY, SHARPLY WARNING WORLD POWERS AGAINST GIVING SUPPORT TO IRAN DURING THE CEASE-FIRE PERIOD.  FROM ITS PROMINENCE, IT UNDOUBTEDLY EMANATED FROM THE PRESIDENCY ITSELF.  THE COMMENTARY WARNED THAT "SOME IMPERIALIST POWERS" (UNSPECIFIED BUT CLEARLY INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WANT TO KEEP ARAB COUNTRIES OCCUPIED IN DISPUTES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS (I.E., IRAN) IN ORDER TO PROTECT ISRAEL.  IT CLAIMED CERTAIN POWERS HAD PRESSED IRAN TO ACCEPT RESOLUTION 598 IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI'S COLLAPSE.  3. COMMENT: WHILE WE KNOW THE IRAQIS FEAR THAT THE U.S. WILL RESUME A PRO-IRANIAN POLICY TO THE DETRIMENT OF IRAQI INTERESTS, THE PROMINENCE AND TIMING OF THE EDITORIAL ARE CURIOUS.  WE HAVE REASSURAD THE IRAWI AZ A HIGH GEVEL AND THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS THAT WE DO NOT CONTEMPLATE "TILTING" IN EITHER DIRECTION.  4. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS FORM OF INARTICULATE LASHING OUT SERVES MORE THAN ANYTHING TO DEMONSTRATE IRAQ'S SENSE OF INSECURITY.  A NEW ERA IS EMERGING, AND IRAQ IS NERVOUS ABOUT THE DEVELOPING ATTITUDES OF EXTERNAL POWERS.  SADDAM'S INSTINCTIVE REACTION IS TO WARN WITH BLUSTERING, UNSPECIFIC THREATS.  TARIQ AZIZ AND THE MFA DIPLOMATSSTRESS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME COIN, I.E., THEIR HOPE AND DESIRE THAT THE POST-WAR PERIOD WILL WITNESS BROADER AND CLOSER COOPERATION WITH THE USG THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BAGHDAD 04587  GENEVA FOR MARSH  E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR TAGS: PREL, UNSC, IZ SUBJECT: IRAN-IRAQ: EVE OF GENEVA  REF: (A) BAGHDAD 4454  (B) STATE 270576  1. CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEST.  2. SUMMARY: THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA HAVING CONCEDED TO IRAN WHAT IT WANTED MOST, I.E., A CEASE-FIRE, AND THEY ARE, WE SUSPECT, DUBIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OHEZ CAN GET OUT OF THE TALKS.  THEY WANT ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION (INCLUDING WARSHIPS) WITHOUT INSPECTION BY IRAN; NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN; NO VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL COMMITTEE ACCUSING IRAQ; CLEAR DEMARCATION OF LAND BORDERS; AND ULTIMATELY, A PEACE TREATY WHICH GUARANTEES THE MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE OF ALL, . NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS (INCLUDING WITHDRAWAL OF SUPPORT OF KURDS). THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE IRAQIS PROBABLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A CLERICAL REGIME, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI DIES, CAN BE ANYTHING BUT EXPANSIONIST/REVOLUTIONARY, SO THAT NO PEACE TREATY WOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN THE LONG RUN. END SUMMARY.  3. THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA IN A QUANDARY.  THEY HAVE ALREADY CONCEDED TO IRAN THE MAIN THING IRAN WANTED RIGHT NOW, I.E.,  CEASE-FIRE -- A BREATHING SPACE JUST WHEN IRAQ HAD TURNED THE TABLES MILITARILY. THEY MADE THIS CONCESSION PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF NEARLH UNAH YUNCOLDS OVER IRAN IS MILITARY THREAT, AND THE REPUBLICAN GUARD CONTINUES TO BE MASSED OPPOSITE ABADAN AS A POTENT WARNING TO IRAN. BUT THE JUBILANT CELEBRATIONS ALL OVER IRAQ MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT THREAT.  4. THE PRINCIPAL DETERMINANT OF WHETHER THE IRAQIS WILL BE FORTHCOMING OR OBSTRUCTIONIST AT GENEVA IS THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE KEY ISSUE: IS IRAN REALLY INERESTED IN COMPJEHENSIVE PEACE?  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IRAQIS THEMSELVES DO WANT A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE. FOR ALL THEIR PRESENT MILITARY ADVANTAGE, WE DOUBT THAT THEY ENTERTAIN NOTIONS OF MILITARY CONQUEST OF IRAN.  THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH IRAN AND THAT IN TIME THE TABLES MAY TURN BACK THE OTHER WAY AGAIN, WITH IRAN RESURGING IN STRENGTH MILITARILY AND ECONOMICALLY.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND WITH THE KURDS, THEY BADLY NEED A GUARANTEE OF NONSUPPORT OF THE KURDS FROM IRAN.  BUT FOR ALL THEIR YEARNING FOR A GENUINE PEACE, WE DOUBT LHAHTHE IRAQIS ARE NAIVE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT ANY CLERICAL REGIME IN IRAN, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI DIES, WILL RENOUNCE THE REVOLUTION OR ITS INTEGRAL ELEMENTS, EXPANSIONISM AND INTER- FERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, PRINCIPALLY IRAQ'S.  5. IF THIS ASSESSMENT IS CORRECT, WE PREDICT THAT EVEN THOUGH TARIQ AZIZ EMPHATICALLY WANTS TO AVOID A LONG PERIOD OF "NO PEACE, NO WAR" (ALONG THE LINES OF THE POST-1948 ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE), THE IRAQIS WILL NOT BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO BE FORTHCOMING IN THE GENEVA TALKS, SINCE A PEACE TREATY WOULD NOT IMPEL THE IRANIANS TO SCALE DOWN THEIR LONG- TERM REVOLUTIONARY AMBITIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE A SERIES BF ULTIMATE GAINS THE IRAQIS MIGHT AIM FOR, INCLUDING:  -- ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION IN THE GULF/HORMUZ/ SHATT, INCLUDING FOR WARSHIPS WITHOUT INSPECTION OR HINDRANCE BY IRAN.  THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POINT WAS ALREADY MADE CLEAR TWO DAYS AFTER IRAN'S ACCEPTANCE OF 598 IN TARIQ AZIZ'S JULY 20 LETTER, OVER HALF OF WHICH WAS DEVOTED TO THE ISSUE OF NAVIGATION.  THE IRAQIS EMPHASIZE IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT, BUT BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS A TEST OF IRANIAN INTENTIONS.  AT A BASER LEVEL, THEY MAY ALSO WANT TO DRIVE THIS POINT HOME AS A WAY TO EMBARRASS IRAN;  -- DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES AS VOUCHSAFED IN PREVIOUS TREATIES INCLUDING THE ALGIERS ACCORD, WHICH IRAN FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON.  THE IRAQIS NOW OCCUPY ZAYN AL-QAWS, SAIF SA'D, AND THE OTHER TINY SECTORS (ONLY 356 SQ. KM. ALL TOLD), MAKING THEIR POSITION NOT ONLY LEGALLY (##) MISSION OFFICIALS SPENT FOUR YEARS FINDING EVER MORE INGENIOUS WAYS TO AVOID THE DEMARCATION, AND SO IRAN CONTINUED TO HOLD ZAYN AL-QAWS, SAIF SA'D, AND THE OTHER POCKETS.  DDING TO IRAQI ANGER IS THE FACT THAT IRAN SHELLED BORDER TOWNS IN SEPTEMBER 1980 FROM THESE POCKETS -- INDEED, THE IRAQIS ARGUE THAT THAT SHELLING WAS THE IMMEDIATE TRIGGER OF THE WAR;  -- CANCELLATION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD INSOFAR AS CONCERNS THE SHATT, I.E., RETURN OF SOVEREIGNTY TO IRAQ OVER THE ENTIRE RIVER COURSE.  THE IRAQIS HAVE LEFT THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OPEN AT PRESENT, SAYING THAT THE SHATT SHOULD BE CLEARED FOR UTILI- ZATION BY BOTH PARTIES AND SPEAKING INFORMALLY OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.  BUT IF THE IRANIANS DO NOT COME FORWARD ON THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ACCORD, BOTH IN REFERENCE TO NONINTERFERENCE AND DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES, THE IRAQIS WILL CERTAINLY NOT CONCEDE ON SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL THE RIVER.  (THEY MAY NOT CONCEDE AT ALL.);  -- NO NEGATIVE VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY.  WE THINK THE IRAQIS UNDERSTAND FULL WELL THAT NO COM- MITTEE WILL EVER GIVE IRAQ A POSITIVE VERDICT -- THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE A "NONVERDICT" THAT IMPUGNS BOTH SIDES OR ONE THAT BLAMES IRAQ FOR STARTING THE WAR.  THE IRAQIS HAVE ALWAYS EXUDED CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF AN IMPARTIAL BODY SET UP TO EXAMINE THE GENERALIZED ISSUE OF "RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR," AS OPPOSED TO THE NARROW QUESTION OF "WHO STARTED THE WAR"  -- INDEED, THE IRAQIS CALLED FOR SUCH AN IMPARTIAL INQUIRY AS FAR BACK AS 1982.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY ARE NOT EAGER FOR SUCH AN INQUIRY AND INSIST ON EXAMINATION OF ISSUES IN 598 IN STRICT SEQUENTIAL ORDER;  -- NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN.  A YEAR AGO IF IRAN HAD ACCEPTED 598, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL-PLACED, WITH MAJNUN AND FAW IN ITS POSSESSION, TO DEMAND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF REPARATIONS.  NOW THEY HAVE LOST THEIR LEVERAGE.  THE IRAQIS WILL BE UNWILLING TO ADMIT THE CONCEPT OF REPARATIONS, AND THEY WILL WANT RECONSTRUCTION FOR ONE SIDE TO BE BALANCED BY RECONSTRUCTION FOR THE OTHER.  6. IMPORTANT AS THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES ARE FOR IRAQ, THE MOST IMPORTANT, AND MOST ELUSIVE, IS AN ASSURANCE OF NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, MEANING NONSUPPORT FOR THE KURDS AND THE SHI'A.  THE IRAQI MFA STRESSES TO DIPLOMATS THAT KHOMEINI'S BREACH OF THIS SINGLE ISSUE IN THE ALGIERS ACCORD IS THE BASIS FOR IRAQI INSISTENCE THAT IRAN HAS (DE FACTO) ABROGATED THE AGREEMENT.  IT WAS THE ASSURANCE OF NONINTERFERENCE THAT PROMPTED THE IRAQIS -- SADDAM HUSSEIN AS THE PARTY'S VICE-CHARIMAN AND SA'DUN HAMMADI AS FOREIGN MINISTER -- TO SWALLOW THEIR PRIDE IN 1975 AND AGREE TO GIVING UP FULL SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SHATT, SOMETHING THAT IRAQ, AND BEFORE IT THE OTTOMANS, HAD ALWAYS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED UPON. (IRAQ, UNLIKE IRAN, HAS ONLY A TINY COAST AND VIEWS THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES RIVER SYSTEMS AS ITS OWN, NOTE BY OC/T: (##) OMISSION IN TEXT CORRECTION TO FOLLOW... COMPLETELY NON-PERSIAN.)  THE SHAH'S AGREEMENT TO NONINTERFERENCE IN 1975 HAD A STUNNINGLY IMMEDIATE IMPACT -- MULLA MUSTAFA BARZANI FLED TO THE UNITED STATES WITHIN WEEKS AND THE SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL OF IRANIAN SUPPORT COMPLETELY DEVASTATED THE KURDISH INSURGENCY -- AND A SIMILAR RESULT WOULD PROBABLY OCCUR NOW.  HOWEVER, WHILE THE PRESENT IRANIAN REGIME HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD TO THE SHATT AL-ARAB, IT HAS BREATHED NOTHING  ABOUT ITS OWN PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  7. ANOTHER GOAL -- PARTICULARLY TRICKY -- FOR IRAQ WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT INTERNATIONAL STRICTURES ON SUPPLY OF ARMS TO IRAN CONTINUE AND THAT WESTERN FLEETS CONTINUE IN PLACE IN THE GULF.  IRAQ IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL-PLACED TO PRESSURE EXTERNAL POWERS.  THE FACT MAY NOT BE LOST ON THE IRAQIS THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR REMAINS IN THE HEADLINES OF THE WORLD MEDIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO OBSTRUCT THE GENEVA PROCESS AND, INDEED, TO RENEW HOSTILITIES.  IRAQ WANTS TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THIS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BECOME ISOLATED OR HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY POINT A FINGER DIRECTLY AT IRAQ AS THE CONTINUER OF THE WAR.  8. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER, IRANIAN OBJECTIVES AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE, ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM IRAQ'S:  -- THE IRANIANS HAVE THE CEASE-FIRE; THE TRICK FOR THEM NOW IS TO MAINTAIN IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, GIVING AS LITTLE AWAY AS POSSIBLE;  -- THEIR IDEA OF A "COMPREHENSIVE PEACE" IS SIMPLY A NONAGGRESSION PACT.  IN MAHALLATI'S MOST RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT (TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW AUGUST 20, FBIS NC2008073888) THE ONLY SPECIFIC POINT HE MEN- TIONED THAT IS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE GENEVA TALKS IS "STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT RENEWED AGGRESSION."  -- REASSERTION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD ONLY IN REGARD TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SHATT, I.E., BOUNDARY AT THE THALWEG, WITHOUT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS ON NONINTER- FERENCE OR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS;  -- INSISTENCE ON RIGHT TO INSPECT ALL VESSELS IN THE GULF AND TO CONFISCATE ALL WAR-RELATED MATERIEL, INCLUDING SEIZING WARSHIPS;  -- VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY (WHICH THE IRANIANS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE STACKED WITH PARTIES OF THEIR CHOOSING) COMPLETELY IN IRAN'S FAVOR;  -- MASIVE REPARATIONS ONLY TO IRAN;  -- PERIOD OF QUIET IN WHICH THE WORLD FORGETS ABOUT IRAN AND IRAQ, THE WESTERN FLEETS GO HOME, STRICTURES ON ARMS DELIVERIES ARE LIFTED.  9. THE IRANIAN CONCEPT OF THE DIRECT TALKS AT GENEVA IS ALREADY BECOMING CLEAR.  AS MUCH AS THE IRANIANS PURPORT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SECRETARY GENERAL IS COMPLETELY ON THEIR SIDE, THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE IN HIS AUGUST 8 LETTER, SENT IDENTICALLY TO BOTH TEHRAN AND BAGHDAD: "BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED THAT DIRECT TALKS SHALL BE HELD UNDER MY AUSPICES TO REACH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF RESOLUTION 598."  TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE IRANIAN VIEW (AGAIN, MAHALLATI'S AUGUST 20 IN- TERVIEW), "THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS BEEN GRANTED THE RIGHT TO INVITE BOTH SIDES TO TALK ONLY ABOUT ARTICLE 4 OF THE RESOLUTION, AND NOT THE TOPICS INCLUDED IN ARTICLES 1-8."  ARTICLE 4 DEALS WITH "ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES," I.E., THOSE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE RESOLUTION.  10. ANOTHER ELEMENT CALLING FOR PESSIMISM ABOUT THE HARMONIOUS PROGRESS OF TALKS IN GENEVA IS IRAQ'S DEEP DISTRUST OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  WELL AWARE OF THIS DISTRUST, THE SYG MIGHT HAVE MOVED QUICKLY TO FIND A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, BUT HE HAS NOT YET DONE SO, AND INSTEAD HE IS SEEN AS JEALOUSLY GUARDING LEADERSHIP OF THE PROCESS IN HIS OWN HANDS AND OF ONE SUBORDINATE, GIANNI PICCO (WHOM THE IRAQIS HAVE ALSO TAKEN A DISLIKE TO, APPARENTLY).  RECRIMINATIONS ROSE TO A CRESCENDO DURING THE PAST WEEK, WITH THE IRAQIS BELIEVING THE SYG WAS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE A FORESHADOWING OF HIS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, INCLUDING A REFERENCE TO THE ALGIERS ACCORD.  THE SYG HAS ALLOWED HIMSELF TO APPEAR TO BE ARGUING THE IRANIANS' BRIEF, WITH INCALCULABLE DETRIMENT TO HIS STANDING AS AN IMPARTIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PROCESS.  11. INITIAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES IN GENEVA -- NOT TO MENTION SUBSTANCE -- ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFICULT. THE IRAQIS WILL REACT SHARPLY TO ANY SUGGESTIONS ON PROCEDURE THAT APPEAR TO BE IMPOSED BY THE SYG. THEY WILL PROBABLY INSIST THAT EVEN THE MOST MUNDANE MATTERS OF PROCEDURE BE WORKED OUT DIRECTLY BY THE TWO PARTIES.  THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT A PREARRANGED AGENDA -- IN THEIR EMPHASIS ON STRICT SEQUENTIALITY, THE IRAQIS HAVE SIGNALED THAT AN AGENDA IS NOT "MERE" PROCEDURE FOR THEM.  12. FOR DCM MARSH IN GENEVA: AN EXCELLENT CONTACT IN THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL BE DR. RIYAD AL-QAYSI. (AMBASSADOR HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM THIS EVENING, AUGUST 23, JUST BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE.)  HE HAS BEEN THE FOREMOST INTERNATIONAL JURIST IN THE IRAQI MFA FOR OVER A DECADE.  WHILE OFFICIALLY HE IS DIRECTOR OF THE MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OFFICE, HE HAS BEEN WORKING FULL TIME FOR OVER A YEAR ON BUILDING THE IRAQI LEGAL CASE FOR THE IMPARTIAL COMMITTEE (IF IT IS EVER ESTABLISHED) AND FOR ALL OTHER MATTERS IN 598; HE KNOWS     EVERY ASPECT, DOWN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL, OF THE CENTURIES- OLD BORDER/SHATT DISPUTE.  QAYSI HAS A SHARP MIND AND IS AN ENGAGING INTERLOCUTOR, ALTHOUGH HE CAN BE OVERLY LEGALISTIC.  AS DEPARTMENT HAS INFORMED YOU, THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL ALSO INCLUDE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE KITTANI AND AMBASSADOR ANBARI.  MFA HAS INFORMED US THAT ANBARI WAS ASSIGNED TO THE IRAQI DELEGATION BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LEGAL BACKGROUND (ANOTHER LAWYER -- THE IRAQIS WILL BE FULLY PREPARED TO BE STICKLERS, AS THE NEED ARISES).

SUMMARY:  WHILE STILL CELEBRATING ITS "VICTORY" IN THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, IRAQ APPEARS BENT ON RETURNING TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  EMPHASIS IS LAID ON BASRA'S RESURRECTION AND THE RE-OPENING OF THE PORT OF UMM QASR.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ DENIED THAT IRAN HAD SEARCHED AN IRAQI SHIP AND WARNED THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO DO SO WOULD BRING REPERCUSSIONS.  END SUMMARY.  3.  IRAQIS CELEBRATED THE OFFICIAL CEASEFIRE WITH AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AS THEY DID THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CEASEFIRE ON AUGUST 8, BUT WITHOUT THE WIDESPREAD DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS WHICH MARKED THE EARLIER CELE- BRATIONS.  JUBILANT CROWDS SURGED THROUGH THE STREETS DURING THE EVENING HOURS OF AUGUST 19-21.  PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN ATTENDED A HUGE GOVERNMENT RALLY AT GREAT FESTIVITIES SQUARE IN BAGHDAD AUGUST 20; UNUSUALLY FOR HIM, HE PERMITTED A THRONG OF THOUSANDS TO CONVERGE ON HIM.  ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT, HE DECLARED AUGUST 21 A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. THE MEDIA REPORTED THAT "TENS OF THOUSANDS" OF PILGRIMS RENEWED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SADDAM ON VISITS DURING THE SHI'A HOLY DAY OF ASHURA (AUGUST 22) TO THE "SHRINE OF SADDAM'S GREAT ANCESTOR" THE IMAM HUSAYN,. IN THE SHI'A HOLY CITY OF KARBALA.  (ONE SHI'A PILGRIM TO KARBALA TELLS US, HOWEVER, THAT REVERENCE TO SADDAM HAD NO PART AT ALL IN THIS YEAR'S ASHURA CELEBRATION.)  4.  AS THE CELEBRATIONS CONTINUED, THE IRAQIS OPENED THE AIRPORT AT BASRA TO CIVILIAN AIR TRAFFIC AUGUST 20, AND RE-OPENED THE PORTS OF UMM QASR AND KHOR AL-ZUBAIR TO MERCHANT SHIPPING.  REPORTS IN BAGHDAD CLAIM BASRA HAS BEEN GIVEN FIRST CALL ON WHATEVER IS NEEDED TO RETURN THE TOWN TO ITS PREWAR CONDITION AND ITS STATUS AS IRAQ'S SECOND LARGEST CITY.  MOST OF BASRA'S POPULATION, HALF OF WHICH FLED THE CITY DURING THE WAR, HAS NOW RETURNED. NOW, PAINT AND BUILDING MATERIALS ARE REPORTEDLY BEING DIVERTED THERE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SHORTAGES ARE FEARED ELSEWHERE IN IRAQ.  GULF AIR, OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF BAHRAIN, QATAR, OMAN, AND ABU DHABI, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RESUME SERVICE TO BAGHDAD AND TEHRAN.  5.  IRAQ'S NAVAL COMMANDER DENIED THAT IRAN HAD SEARCHED AN IRAQI MERCHANT VESSEL IN THE GULF AUGUST 20, AND CLAIMED THAT IRANIANS HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO BOARD THE IRAQI SHIP.  THE IRANIANS SENT A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP TO HOVER ABOVE THE VESSEL WHILE AN IRANIAN NAVAL SHIP SHADOWED IT, HE SAID.  THE COMMANDER DECLARED THAT IRAQ WAS DETERMINED TO EXERCISE FULLY ITS RIGHTS TO FREE NAVIGATION IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS, AND WOULD COUNTER ANY IRANIAN MOVE WHICH INTERFERED WITH THESE RIGHTS.

SUMMARY: IRAQ HAS CONTINUED TO WARN AGAINST COUNTRIES WHICH WOULD TRY TO "DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS VICTORY" AND REGAIN THEIR LOST INPLUENCE IN IRAN. REFLECTING IRAQI FEARS OF A U.S.-IRANIAN RAPPROCHE- MENT, THE WARNINGS QUOTE FOREIGN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEHRAN IS BEING REFURBISHED AND NOTE THAT "NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES THE ARCH SATAN ANY LONGER."  END SUMMARY.  3.  IRAQI MEDIA AUGUST 22, GAVE PROMINENT COVERAGE TO REPORTS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN THE MADRID NEWSPAPER EL PAIS AND THE PARIS WEEKLY EXPRESS, THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY BUILDINGS IN TEHRAN ARE BEING REFURBISHED.  EXPRESS IS QUOTED THAT THE IRANIAN REGIME INTENDS TO VINDICATE THE "GREAT SATAN," WHILE EL PAIS IS REPORTEDLY MORE EXPLICIT, DECLARING THAT IRAN IS MOVING QUICKLY TO REESTAB- LISH RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  EL PAIS'S TEHRAN CORRESPONDENT REPORTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY AT THE U.S. EMBASSY TO REINSTATE NORMAL ACTIVITIES.  4. ALSO ON AUGUST 22, THE MAIN EDITORIAL IN BOTH THE BA'TH PARTY AND GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS (THAWRA AND JUMHURIYA) WARNED THAT UNNAMED POWERS ARE "MANEUVERING TO DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS VICTORY."  THESE POWERS ARE ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE UPCOMING NEGOTIA- TIONS TO REGAIN THEIR LOST INFLUENCE IN IRAN.  A SIMILAR EDITORIAL IN THAWRA ON AUGUST 21 CLAIMED THAT "NO ONE IN THE CAPITALS OF THESE STATES ANY LONGER CONDEMNS IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM OR IRANIAN EXTORTION THROUGH HOLDING HOSTAGES.  AT THE SAME TIME, NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES OR REMEMBERS THE ARCH SATAN ANY LONGER" (FBIS JN2108072288).  5. COMMENT: THE IRAQIS' FEAR OF U.S.-IRAN RAPPROACHE- MENT HAS BEEN REFLECTED MORE PROMINENTLY IN THE PAST WEEK'S MEDIA THAN PREVIOUSLY.  WE WOULD ASSUME SADDAM GAVE A SIGNAL OF CONCERN TO HIS INFORMATION MINISTER JASIM, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN READY TO ABUSE THE UNITED STATES.  WHAT IS NOT CLEAR TO US IS WHAT THE U.S. HAS DONE, SINCE THE TALABANI AFFAIR AT LEAST, THAT WOULD HAVE SPURRED THIS CONCERN.   GLASPIE

AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MFA UNDERSECRETARY HAMDUN ON JUNE 5 TO RESUME DIALOGUE ON THE PROBLEM OF SOVIET ARMS SALES TO IRAN.  POINTING OUT THAT REFTEL HAD BEEN DRAFTED PRIOR TO THE NEWS OF KHOMEINI'S DEATH, AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT WHATEVER GOVERNMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY EMERGE IN TEHRAN, FOR THE MOMENT  WE HAVE A RAFSANJANI VISIT SCHEDULED FOR MOSCOW JUNE  21.  WE ARE URGING GULF CAPITALS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO REGISTER WITH THE SOVIETS CLEARLY THAT THERE WILL BE STRONG NEGATIVE ARAB REACTION TO RESUMPTION OF ARMS DELIVERIES TO IRAN.  3.  AMBASSADOR THEN WENT THROUGH TICKS IN PARA FOUR REFTEL, REITERATING THAT WE WERE GRATEFUL FOR THE IRAQIS CONTINUING TO SHARE WITH US THEIR THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE OF GRAVE MUTUAL CONCERN TO BOTH OF OUR GOVERNMENTS.  4.  HAMDUN RESPONDED THAT HE DID HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT.  FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE SOVIETS HAVE ADMITTED TO THE GOI THAT THEY DO INTEND TO SELLARMS, THOUGH REFUSING TO GIVE ANY SPECIFICS.  THEY CLAIM THEY WOULD NOT GIVE IRAN    EVERYTHING IT ASKED FOR AND THAT THE ARMS PACKAGE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO TIP THE REGIONAL BALANCE.  THE SOVIETS' JUSTIFICATION TO THE IRAQIS WAS SIMPLE -- IF MOSCOW DOES NOT SELL THE ARMS THE WEST WILL.  5.  FOR ITS PART, HAMDUN SAID, IRAQ CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS POSITION CLEAR TO THE SOVIETS, AND HAS ASKED KUWAIT, YAR, JORDAN, AND EGYPT, TO DO SO AS WELL.  WITH REGARD TO THE GULF, HOWEVER, HAMDUN EMPHASIZED, THE SOVIETS ARE PROBABLY PLAYING ON A SECOND TRACK.  IRAQ BELIEVES MOSCOW IS TRYING TO SET UP AN "AXIS" TO INCLUDE THE KABUL REGIME, IRAN, AND THE IRANIAN BASED MUJAHIDIN: I.E. THEY ARE SEEKING ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR ARMS SALES TO TEHRAN WHICH WILL AT THE SAME TIME HELP THEIR POSITION IN AFGHANISTAN.  EVIDENCE FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS HAD COME FROM REPORTED REMARKS BY THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE.  6.  ACTION RECOMMENDED:  AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT HAMDUN RECOMMENDED BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD OR SHOULD DO NEXT.  HE SUGGESTED WE BOTH MAKE AN APPROACH NOW, ALONG THE LINES OF REFTEL, TO THE EGYPTIANS.  AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THIS WAS A SENSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION AND SAID SHE   WOULD CONVEY THIS PROPOSAL IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEPARTMENT.   GLASPIE
