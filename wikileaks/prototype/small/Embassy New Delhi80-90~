SUMMARY:  ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PUNJAB STATE ON AUGUST 6 IN CONTINUING SECTARIAN STRIFE. DELHI POLICE ARE GEARING UP TO MEET THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY BEFORE THE INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS ON AUGUST 15.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S CONVENTION, HELD AUGUST 4, PROVIDED A FORUM FOR EXTREME AND MODERATE POINTS OF VIEW WITH NO OBVIOUS MEETING OF MINDS.  END SUMMARY  2.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS ELEVEN PEOPLE--NINE OF WHOM WERE HINDUS--WERE KILLED IN TERRORIST RELATED VIOLENCE IN PUNJAB ON AUGUST 6.  TWO ALLEGED TERRORISTS WERE KILLED BY SECURITY FORCES WHO RECOVERED A US MADE AUTOMATIC WEAPON FROM ONE OF THE BODIES.  ALMOST ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE IN AMRITSAR DISTRICT.  A COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA ACTIVIST, AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF PARA MEDICAL EMPLOYEES, WAS SHOT BY THREE TERRORISTS.  THE KILLERS, WHO LEFT A NOTE CLAIMING TO BE FROM THE RANJIT SINGH RANA GROUP, ESCAPED ON THE VICTIM\'S SCOOTER.  3.  ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE HOME MINISTRY \"HAS DEFINITE INFORMATION THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE PLOTTING DO SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE\" IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO INDEPENDENCE DAY.  OTHER SOURCES REPORT THAT THE TERRORISTS WILL PROBABLY STRIKE ON AUGUST 15 FOR MAXIMUM ALL-INDIA ATTENTION.  DELHI POLICE, REELING FROM THEIR FAILURE TO STOP RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE POSH SOUTH DELHI HOUSING COLONIES, ARE STEPPING UP THEIR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL POSSIBLE TERRORIST ENTRY TO THE CITY.  ALL ENTRY POINTS TO THE CITY ARE NOW GUARDED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE POLICE HAVE REPORTEDLY IMPROVED THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT TERRORISTS WOULD NECESSARILY STRIKE IN DELHI, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE PUBLICITY THEY DESIRE.  BOTH HARYANA AND PUNJAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR SECURITY MECHANISMS.  4.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI CONTINUED HIS LONE CAMPAIGN FOR A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE MILITANTS AND MODERATES WITH A SIKH CONVENTION ON AUGUST 4. (SEE REFTEL)  THE CONVENTION WAS A NOISY AFFAIR WITH LITTLE CONGRUENCE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE MODERATES AND MILITANTS AND AN ABUNDANCE OF RADICALISM ON THE PART OF THE MILITANTS.  ALTHOUGH MANY PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONVENTION CLEARLY DEMANDED NO LESS THAN KHALISTAN, THE CONVENTION RESOLUTION CALLED FOR THE SIKHS TO BE GIVEN AN \"AREA AND POLITICAL SETUP IN NORTH INDIA WHERE SIKHS CAN EXPERIENCE THE GLOW OF FREEDOM.\"  ACCORDING TO RAGI, THE DEMAND WAS A SPINOFF FROM AN ASSURANCE GIVEN TO THE SIKHS BY JAWAHARLAL NEHRU IN 1946.  EXPANDING ON THE THEME, THE HIGH PRIEST EXPLAINED THAT THE PROPOSED \"SET-UP\" WOULD RESULT IN GREATER AUTONOMY FOR THE STATE.  A SIKH CLAIMING TO REPRESENT SIKHS LIVING OUTSIDE PUNJAB SAID THAT SIKH DEMANDS REPRESENTED DEMANDS OF ALL INDIAN STATES AND URGED THE HIGH PRIESTS TO START A NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED AUTONOMY.  5.  MODERATE SPEAKERS CALLED FOR A NON-VIOLENT STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF THE SIKHS AND MOST SPEAKERS DEMANDED IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANANDAPUR SAHIB RESOLUTION WHICH CALLED FOR GREATER AUTONOMY IN THE STATES.  THE MILITANTS, AS WAS EXPECTED, DEMANDED THE FORMATION OF KHALISTAN AND DECLARED THAT THE GUN WAS THE ONLY ANSWER FOR THE SIKHS.  THE MILITANT GROUPS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BABBAR KHALSA, ALL QUESTIONED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HIGH PRIESTS BUT MADE NO MOVES TO REPLACE THEM.  IN RAGI\'S CONCLUDING STATEMENT HE AGREED WITH THE MILITANTS THAT THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS WITHOUT WEAPONS.   BUT, THE HIGH PRIEST NOTED, WEAPONS MUST CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND THE TIMES NO LONGER CALLED FOR VIOLENT STRUGGLE.  THE TIME HAD COME, RAGI PLEADED, \"FOR UNITY BETWEEN THOSE WHO FAVORED THE GUN AND THOSE WHO FAVORED NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.\"  6.  THE CONVENTION WAS ATTENDED BY SOME FIVE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS ALL OF WHOM PASSED THROUGH STRICT POLICE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE ENTERING THE GOLDEN TEMPLE.  MODERATE POLITICIANS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AKALI DAL (L), WERE NOT INVITED TO ATTEND THE CONVENTION.  PARTICIPANTS DID INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE \"UNIFIED\" AKALI DAL, THE BABBAR KHALSA, BOTH THE MANJIT SINGH AND GURJIT SINGH FACTIONS OF THE ALL INDIA SIKH STUDENTS FEDERATION, THE BHINDRANWALE TIGERS FORCE OF KHALISTAN, THE KHALISTAN COMMANDO FORCE, THE KHALISTAN LIBERATION FORCE, THE SIKH INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE DALIT FRONT.  INDIVIDUALS LAWYERS, INTELLECTUALS AND RETIRED MILITARY ALSO ATTENDED.  7.  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND THE FLAT RESULT OF DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S ATTEMPTS TO FORGE MILITANT-MODERATE UNITY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON THE SIKH\'S SIDE OF THE PUNJAB DILEMMA.  THE SPEECHES AT THE SIKH CONVENTION SHOW THE DEEP DIFFERENCES THAT REMAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. INDEED, THE FINAL DECLARATION IS AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO PAPER OVER THESE DIVISIONS.  DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S ATTEMPT WAS WELL RECEIVED BY POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND THE HIGH PRIEST REMAINS THE BEST HOPE FOR SOME SOLUTION.   STREEB " }

(C) SUMMARY. ON SEPTEMBER 24 THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ISSUED ANOTHER WARNING TO THE LTTE THAT IT WILL RESPOND MORE FORCEFULLY IF THE TAMIL MILITANT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT STOP HAMPERING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD.  THE MEA SPOKESMAN BLAMED THE LTTE FOR INSTIGATING AND ENGINEERING A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION SEPTEMBER 23 BETWEEN SRI LANKAN CIVILIANS AND ELEMENTS OF THE INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE (IPKF).  THE GROWING THREAT OF SUCH CLASHES BETWEEN SRI LANKANS AND INDIAN TROOPS APPARENTLY LIES BEHIND THE DECISION TO SEND SEVERAL BATTALIONS OF INDIAN POLICE INTO THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA (REFTEL).  THERE IS GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THE LTTE CONTINUES ITS PROVOCATIONS, THE INDIAN FORCES SHOULD MOVE MORE DECISIVELY AGAINST IT.  END SUMMARY.  2. (U) THE MEA SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED THAT A CROWD OF 900 TO 1000 PEOPLE--MAINLY LTTE SUPPORTERS WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE VANGUARD--COLLECTED IN FRONT OF THE IPKF CAMP IN MANNAR, OSTENSIBLY WANTING TO PRESENT A PETITION TO THE LOCAL INDIAN MILITARY COMMANDER. WHILE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE FOR RECEIVING THE PETITION, THE LTTE SUPPORTERS REPORTEDLY STARTED THROWING STRONES, SHOUTING SLOGANS, AND PUSHING THE CROWD INTO THE CAMP.  THE IPKF FIRED FIVE ROUNDS.  TWO PERSONS REPORTEDLY WERE WOUNDED BY THE FIRING AND 17 INJURED N THE RESULTING STAMPEDE.  ACCORDING TO THE LTTE, ONE OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE SUBSEQUENTLY DIED.  ACCORDING TO THE MEA SPOKESMAN, THE USE OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS A COVER FOR THE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WAS \"REPREHENSIBLE AND COWARDLY.\"  HE WARNED THEAT INDIAN TROOPS WOULD BE \"COMPELLED TO RESPOND WITH EVEN STRONGER MEASURES IF VIOLENCE IS DELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY THE LTTE.\"  3. (U) ACCORDING TO MAJOR INDIAN NEWSPAPERS ON SEPTEMBER 25, BOTH THE INDIAN AND SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING IPKF-CIVILIAN TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND AGREED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE INDIAN PARALIMITARY RESERVE POLICE FORCE (REFTEL) IS NECESSARY FOR CROWD-CONTROL DUTIES.  \"IT WAS FELT BY BOTH COUNTRIES THAT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF INDIA THE ARMY MUST NOT BE USED REGULARLY TO PREVENT ETHNIC OR OTHER RIOTS EXCEPT IN EXTREME EMERGENCIES AND FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS.  IT IS ALSO FELT THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE ARMY SOMETIMES ACTS AS AN IRRITANT TO GROUPS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN WARFARE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. . . .  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRPF UNITS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH TEARGAS SHELLS, RUBBER BULLETS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER SUCH VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS BY MOBS. . . . THESE FORCES CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PATROLLING AREAS FROM WHERE REPORTS OF COLONIZATION BY SINHALAS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.\"  4. (C) COMMENT.  SUCCESSIVE GOI WARNINGS TO THE LTTE HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIGH EMPHASIS IN THE INDIAN MEDIA. THERE APPEARS TO BE A GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG INFORMED INDIANS--WHICH IS BEGINNING TO BE EXPRESSED IN NEWSPAPER COMMENTARIES--THAT THE IPKF MUST MOVE DECISIVELY AND FAST TO PREVENT THE INDO-SRI LANKA ACCORD FROM GOING \"THE WAY OF THE PUNJAB ACCORD.\" THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE GOI WON AMONG TAMILS BY ITS AIR-DROP IN JUNE IS BEING ERODED BY LTTE PROPOGANDA ALLEGING THAT THE IPKF IS ACTING AS AN ALLY OF THE COLOMBO GOVERNMENT.  \"THE SITUATION CAN BE SAVED AND THE ATMOSPHERE CREATED FOR MODERATE LEADERS TO COME INTO THE OPEN,\" THE TIMES OF INDIA STATES, \"ONLY IF THE INDIAN TROOPS MOVE QUICKLY AND DISARM THE LTTE COMPLETELY.\"   DEAN " }
