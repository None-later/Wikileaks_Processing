REASON: 1.4 (D)  1. (C) SUMMARY: AN IRANIAN PROFESSOR AND WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVIST DESCRIBED GOVERNMENT  PRESSURE ON ACTIVISTS AND NGOS IN IRAN FOR IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE (IRPO) DIRECTOR AND IRPOFF.  SHE SAID THE SITUATION FOR WOMEN IN IRAN HAS DETERIORATED UNDER THE AHMADINEJAD PRESIDENCY.  WHILE THE POLICE CRACKDOWN ON TWO MAJOR WOMENS RIGHTS DEMONSTRATIONS THIS YEAR CAUGHT HEADLINES, MUCH OF THE PRESSURE HAS BEEN MORE SUBTLE.  THIS INCLUDES PLACING NGOS IN UNCERTAIN LEGAL STATUS, KEEPING A RATING SYSTEM ON LEVELS OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM AMONG STUDENTS, AND OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS TO SPEND THEIR SABBATICALS IN RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS.  END SUMMARY.  WOMEN'S RIGHTS DEMONSTRATIONS DISRUPTED ---------------------------------------  2. (C) IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE (IRPO) DIRECTOR AND IRPOFF MET WITH AN IRANIAN SOCIAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AND WOMEN'S RIGHT ACTIVIST ON OCTOBER 29 TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION FOR WOMEN UNDER THE AHMADINEJAD GOVERNMENT.  THE ACTIVIST NOTED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE FOR SOCIAL ACTIVISM HAS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE TWO WOMEN'S RIGHTS DEMONSTRATIONS BROKEN UP BY POLICE THIS YEAR, SHE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE BACKGROUND TO THE EVENTS AND WHAT FACTORS MAY HAVE AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION.  IN THE CASE OF THE MARCH 8 DEMONSTRATION FOR INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY, THE ORGANIZERS HAD APPLIED FOR A PERMIT TO HOLD THE DEMONSTRATION AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE DEMONSTRATION WAS TO BEGIN, THEY HEARD THEIR PERMIT WAS DENIED, TOO LATE TO INFORM PEOPLE.   POLICE USED BATONS TO BEAT DEMONSTRATORS, INCLUDING RENOWNED SEPTUAGENARIAN POET AND ACTIVIST SIMIN BEHBEHANI.  3. (C) THE PROFESSOR THEN DESCRIBED THE PLANNING FOR THE JUNE 12 DEMONSTRATION TO PROTEST UNEQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN UNDER IRANIAN LAW.  DEMONSTRATORS CALLED FOR LEGAL GENDER EQUALITY, INCLUDING EQUAL RIGHTS IN DIVORCE, CHILD CUSTODY, INHERITANCE, AND COURT TESTIMONY, BEFORE THE RALLY WAS BROKEN UP BY THE POLICE.  SHE MADE CLEAR THAT SHE DISAGREED WITH THE DECISIONS OF THE 10 OR SO ORGANIZERS.  THEY DECIDED NOT TO APPLY FOR A PERMIT, OUT OF CERTAINTY THEY WOULD BE DENIED.  THE PROFESSOR ARGUED THAT NOT AT LEAST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF APPLYING FOR A PERMIT ASSURED THEM A CHARGE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.  INSTEAD OF HOLDING THE DEMONSTRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY AGAIN, WHERE THEY WOULD LIKELY DRAW A SYMPATHETIC CROWD, THE ORGANIZERS CHOSE A BUSY INTERSECTION IN CENTRAL TEHRAN, FILLED WITH WORKING CLASS BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS WHO MET THEM WITH INDIFFERENCE OR HOSTILITY.  4. (C) ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR DIFFERENTIATING THE 2006 RALLIES WITH A MORE SUCCESSFUL 2005 WOMEN'S DEMONSTRATION, THE ACTIVIST EXPLAINED, WAS THAT THE 2005 RALLY WAS HELD SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, WHEN NUMEROUS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS WERE IN TOWN.  SHE BELIEVES THE GOVERNMENT TOLERATED THE EVENT BECAUSE IT DID NOT WANT PICTURES OF A CRACKDOWN ON A DEMONSTRATION GETTING INTERNATIONAL PLAY.  5. (C) THE PROFESSOR ALSO NOTED OTHER SPLITS IN THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS FIELD.  WHEN SHARLA SHERKAT, THE EDITOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE MAGAZINE ZANAN (WOMEN), PUBLICLY DISAGREED WITH THE DECISIONS OF THE EVENT ORGANIZERS, SHE WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT MAINTAINING SOLIDARITY.  NGOS, ACTIVISTS AND PROFESSORS UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY --------------------------------------------- ----------  6. (C) THE PROFESSOR ALSO DISCUSSED LESS OVERT PRESSURES ON CIVIL SOCIETY.  A NUMBER OF NGOS HAVE BEEN LEFT IN LEGAL LIMBO AFTER THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IN EARLY 2006 INSTRUCTED THEM TO FILE FOR NEW PERMITS. THOSE NGOS THAT DID NOT FILE THE REQUEST ARE NOW VULNERABLE TO ACCUSATIONS OF OPERATING WITHOUT A PERMIT. THOSE THAT DID FILE THE PAPERWORK HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE BY LATE OCTOBER, MEANING THEY TOO COULD BE ACCUSED OF OPERATING WITHOUT A PERMIT.  7.(C) THE ACTIVIST NOTED THAT PUBLICATIONS TARGETED TOWARD WOMEN AND FEATURING ARTICLES ABOUT WOMEN'S ADVANCEMENT, SUCH AS THE MAGAZINE ZANAN (WOMEN) STILL PUBLISH, BUT DO SO CAREFULLY, WITH A DEGREE OF SELF-CENSORSHIP.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE HEAD OF THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE FOR WOMEN -- WHOSE APPOINTMENT WAS CRITICIZED FOR HER LACK OF BACKGROUND IN WOMEN'S ISSUES -- HAS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE ARTICLES ABOUT FEMINISM, SUCH AS "FEMINISM AND PROSTITUTION."  8.(C) THE PROFESSOR NOTED THAT THE SITUATION FOR HER FELLOW ACTIVISTS, PARTICULARLY STUDENTS, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DETERIORATED B T #0009 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --  RPO DUBAI 00000009  002.3 OF 002   THIS YEAR. DISCUSSING THE ARREST OF FORMER MAJLES DEPUTY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST ALI AKBAR MUSAVI KHOINI AT THE JUNE 12 DEMONSTRATION, SHE SAID HE HAD BEEN UNDER SURVEILLANCE FOR SOME TIME FOR HIS WORK WITH THE STUDENT ACTIVIST ORGANIZATION, OFFICE FOR CONSOLIDATING UNITY, AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING FOR A REASON TO ARREST HIM.  HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS RALLY PROVIDED THAT REASON, SHE OPINED.  9.(C) THE ACTIVIST ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEVISED A THREE-STARRED SYSTEM FOR RATING STUDENTS' LEVELS OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM.  ONE STAR DENOTES THAT A FILE IS OPEN ON THAT STUDENT; TWO STARS MEANS THAT THE STUDENT IS UNDER SURVEILLANCE; THREE STARS INDICATES THAT THE STUDENT MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO RE-REGISTER FOR CLASSES.  THE GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A SYSTEM, BUT A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO HAD RECEIVED THESE STAR RATINGS PUBLISHED A LIST OF THEIR NAMES AND RATINGS TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE SYSTEM.  10. (C) THERE HAVE BEEN PURGES OF LIBERAL AND SECULAR UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, THE ACTIVIST CONFIRMED.  SHE NOTED THAT THE PURGES HAVE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED THE HUMANITIES DISCIPLINE RATHER THAN SCIENCES, SUCH AS MATHEMATICS OR ECONOMICS. SOME PROFESSORS ARE FIRED, SOME ARE FORCED TO RETIRE, AND STILL OTHERS ARE SIMPLY NOT PROMOTED TO FULL PROFESSORSHIPS. SHE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR PROFESSORS TO STUDY AND TEACH TOPICS THAT ARE "MORE ISLAMIC."  FOR EXAMPLE, THE QVERNMENT OFFERS FULL FUNDING FOR SABBATICALS ONLY IF THE PROFESSORS GO TO THE HOWZEHS (SEMINARY SCHOOLS) IN IRAN'S MAJOR RELIGIOUS CENTERS, QOM OR MASHHAD.  SABBATICALS IN WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE NOT SIMILARLY FUNDED, AND THOSE PROFESSORS WHO GO ON SABBATICAL OR TAKE UP VISITING PROFESSORSHIPS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PLACED UNDER GREATER SCRUTINY.  THAT FACT WAS NOT STOPPING HER, HOWEVER, FROM APPLYING FOR A VISA TO GIVE A SEMINAR AT AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.  11. (C) COMMENT:  THIS SOURCE'S COMMENTS TRACK WITH SIMILAR REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING, IN A SLOW AND RELATIVELY QUIET MANNER TO REVERSE MANY OF THE ADVANCES MADE UNDER FORMER PRESIDENT KHATAMI.  NONETHELESS, SHE MADE CLEAR THAT SOME ACTIVISTS HAD NOT YET BEEN DETERRED FROM THEIR WORK. BURNS B T #0009 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --

REASON: 1.4 (D) 1.(C) SUMMARY.  IRPO AND CONGEN POL/ECONOFFS MET WITH A DUBAI-BASED REPRESENTATIVE OF A WESTERN BANK OCTOBER 30 TO DISCUSS IRANIAN ECONOMIC ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO THE BANKING REP, THE SUPREME LEADER HAS ALLOWED PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD TO TAKE THE FOREFRONT IN DIRECTING DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICY.  HOWEVER, ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT AND A LACK OF A CLEAR MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY HAVE RESULTED IN AN UNSUSTAINABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS, DESPITE CURRENT ROSY INDICATORS (DUE TO HIGH OIL PRICES).  THE REP MAINTAINED THAT USG ACTION AGAINST IRANIAN BANK SADERAT HAS NOT HAD A NOTICEABLE IMPACT ON THE BANK ITSELF OR IRANIAN POLICY.  NONETHELESS, THERE ARE RUMORS IN THE BANKING COMMUNITY THAT IRAN IS ACTIVELY SEEKING REGIONAL CENTRAL BANKS TO HOLD ITS RESERVES.  END SUMMARY.  ECONOMIC POWER IN IRAN -----------------------  2.(C) IRPO AND CONGEN POL/ECONOFFS MET WITH A DUBAI-BASED REPRESENTATIVE OF A WESTERN BANK OCTOBER 30 TO DISCUSS IRANIAN AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  (NOTE: THE OFFICIAL, WHO CLOSELY FOLLOWS IRAN, ASKED TO SPEAK OFF THE RECORD. ENDNOTE) ACCORDING TO THE BANK OFFICIAL, THE SUPREME LEADER HAS ALLOWED PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD TO TAKE THE FOREFRONT IN DIRECTING DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICY.  WESTERNERS WHO INTERACT PRIMARILY WITH THE IRANIAN INTELLECTUAL ELITE AND REFORMISTS OFTEN LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE POOR, RURAL POPULATION ELECTED AHMADINEJAD BASED MOSTLY ON HIS PROMISES OF ECONOMIC REFORM. THE PRESIDENT HAS IN FACT MADE GOOD ON HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND CONTINUES TO REACH OUT TO THE MOST RURAL AREAS (THROUGH POPULIST MEASURES SUCH AS THE GIFTING OF REFRIGERATORS, ETC).  ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT -----------------------  3.(C) DESPITE CURRENT ROSY INDICATORS IN IRAN (INCLUDING HIGH GDP GROWTH AND DECLINING UNEMPLOYMENT), ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT AND A LACK OF A CLEAR MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY HAVE RESULTED IN AN UNSUSTAINABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS, ACCORDING TO THE BANKING REPRESENTATIVE.  IRAN'S MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY HAS SUFFERED UNDER AHMADINEJAD, THE URBAN POPULATION IS WORSE OFF, AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRAN (CBI) HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF MANY OF ITS TOOLS TO INFLUENCE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (E.G. SETTING OF INTEREST RATES). CURRENTLY, THE OFFICIAL NOTED, REAL INTEREST RATES ARE NEGATIVE, AND INCREASED OIL REVENUE AND GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES HAVE RESULTED IN FIVE YEAR-HIGH LIQUIDITY RATES (ROUGHLY 36 PERCENT).   4. (C) THE OFFICIAL ADDED THAT OVERALL BANK SAVINGS ARE UP, WHICH SOME ATTRIBUTE TO A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE "SAVINGS CULTURE."  IN REALITY, THESE SAVINGS ARE NOT COMING FROM THE POPULATION BUT FROM THE CBI.  THE INCREASED CASH FLOW IS UNSUSTAINABLE, AS THE GOVERNMENT IS DIPPING INTO ITS RESERVES AND THE OIL STABILIZATION FUND TO BANKROLL ITS POPULIST EXPENDITURES.  IF SPENDING REMAINS UNCHECKED, ADDITIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE PUT ON THE INFLATION RATE.  THE CBI IS INCREASING SAVINGS AS ONE OF ITS ONLY REMAINING TOOLS TO REIGN IN LIQUIDITY AND OFFSET INFLATION.  IRAN'S FOREIGN RESERVES ------------------------  5.(C) THE DUBAI BANK CONTACT SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE BANKING COMMUNITY RUMOR MILL, THE CBI RECENTLY BEGAN APPROACHING OTHER CENTRAL BANKS IN THE REGION ABOUT HOLDING SOME OF ITS RESERVES. HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT KNOWN IF IT FOUND ANY TAKERS.  IMPACT OF US ACTION AGAINST SADERAT -----------------------------------  6.(C) THE DUBAI-BASED BANKING REPRESENTATIVE OPINED THAT USG ACTION TAKEN AGAINST IRAN'S BANK SADERAT HAS NOT HAD A NOTICEABLE IMPACT.  THE BANK REP SAID THAT ADDITIONAL MEASURES AGAINST IRANIAN BANKS WOULD MOST LIKELY SOLIDIFY DUBAI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN AND INCREASE EUROPEAN, PARTICULARLY GERMAN (ALREADY VERY ACTIVE), PARTICIPATION IN THE IRANIAN ECONOMY.  POL/ECONOFFS AND THE BANKING REP DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT SINCE GULF COUNTRIES PEG THEIR CURRENCIES TO THE DOLLAR, MUCH OF THE REGIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT IS DOLLARIZED.  THE OFFICIAL CLAIMED THAT FURTHER ACTION TO LIMIT U-TURN TRANSACTIONS WOULD FORCE IRAN TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE REGION AND TRADE MORE EXCLUSIVELY WITH EUROPEAN FIRMS.  WITH ITS EXTENSIVE B T #0010 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --  RPO DUBAI 00000010  002.3 OF 002   EUROPEAN BANKING NETWORK, DUBAI WOULD BE A NATURAL MIDDLE GROUND TO FACILITATE SUCH TRADE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE PREDICTED THAT EVENTUALLY, IRAN (AND TO SOME EXTENT DUBAI) WOULD SWITCH ITS HOLDING RESERVES INTO EUROS, WHICH COULD IN TURN WEAKEN THE DOLLAR.  (NOTE:  THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE UAE HAS BEEN DISCUSSING MOVING SOME PERCENTAGE OF ITS RESERVES INTO EUROS FOR MONTHS NOW, BUT HAS SHOWN LITTLE INCLINATION TO MOVE QUICKLY.  ENDNOTE)  IRAN REACHING OUT -----------------  7.(C) WHEN THE BANKING REPRESENTATIVE WAS ASKED IF IRAN WAS NOTICEABLE INCREASING ITS EFFORTS TO SOLIDIFY EXTERNAL RELATIONS, THE REP NOTED THAT YES, IRAN IS INDEED ATTEMPTING TO CULTIVATE GREATER EXTERNAL LINKS BOTH WITH ITS IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COMMUNITY.  ACCORDING TO THE BANK REP, VENEZUELA HAS REPORTEDLY DIVERTED SOME OF ITS OIL EXPORTS FROM THE US TO IRAN IN TRADE FOR REFRIGERATORS. (NOTE: IRPOOFF COULD NOT FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO CORROBORATE THIS CLAIM OF TRADED REFRIGERATORS, HOWEVER IRAN HAS 61 KNOWN DEALS WITH VENEZUELA VALUED AT USD 1.8 BILLION (REFTEL). ENDNOTE)  8.(C) COMMENT:  SOME CONTACTS HAVE SAID THAT INITIALLY AHMADINEJAD WAS NOT ALLOWED TO INSTALL HIS OWN PEOPLE INTO KEY ECONOMIC POSITIONS, TO MINIMIZE HIS INFLUENCE ON MACROECONOMIC POLICY.  WHETHER OR NOT AHMADINEJAD IS ASSUMING GREATER CONTROL OF MACROECONOMIC POLICY IS OPEN TO DEBATE.  ONE INTERESTING INDICATOR IS THAT DESPITE LONGSTANDING RUMORS THAT CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR EBRAHIM SHEIBANI - A CARRYOVER FROM THE KHATAMI ADMINISTRATION - WOULD BE REPLACED, TO DATE HE HAS HELD ON TO HIS POSITION.

DUBAI 1217, B. RPO DUBAI 0008  RPO DUBAI 00000011  001.3 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: JILLIAN BURNS, DIRECTOR, IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF STATE. REASON: 1.4 (D)  1.(C) SUMMARY:  ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD ON DECEMBER 15 FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS, THE 86-MEMBER CLERICAL BODY THAT ELECTS AND NOMINALLY SUPERVISES THE SUPREME LEADER.  SEVERAL IRPO CONTACTS HAVE PREDICTED LOW VOTER TURNOUT, NOTING THAT THE ELECTION WILL BRING NO IMMEDIATE CHANGES, AND CITIZENS HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO VOTE.  OTHERS SAY THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS ELECTION HAS THE POTENTIAL OF IMPACTING FUTURE POWER ALIGNMENTS IN THE IRANIAN REGIME. THEY NOTE THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL REFLECT THE RESULTS OF A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN AYATOLLAH MESBAH-YAZDI, THE ARCH-CONSERVATIVE SPIRITUAL ADVISOR OF AHMADINEJAD, AND EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN ALI AKBAR RAFSANJANI, WHO IS ALSO CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY.  ELECTION COVERAGE IN THE IRANIAN PRESS LARGELY CENTERS ON CANDIDATE LISTS, AND THE ATTEMPTED USE, IN AT LEAST ONE CASE, OF THE RELIGIOUS QUALIFICATION EXAM TO BAR A REFORMIST CANDIDACY.  ONE CHALLENGE FOR THE US WILL BE HOW TO FRAME OUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT THE ELECTION OF THIS CONTROVERSIAL BODY. END SUMMARY.  2.(U) ON DECEMBER 15, ELECTIONS FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS -- THE CLERICAL BODY THAT ELECTS AND NOMINALLY SUPERVISES THE SUPREME LEADER -- WILL BE HELD.  (NOTE: WHILE THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS IS CONSTITUTIONALLY AUTHORIZED TO ELECT, SUPERVISE AND EVEN REPLACE THE SUPREME LEADERS, THE SUPREME LEADERS POWER AND INFLUENCE GREATLY CONSTRAINS THE SUPERVISORY ROLE.)  THE ASSEMBLY IS AN 86-MEMBER BODY ELECTED ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEARS IN NATIONWIDE POLLS.  IT MEETS TWICE A YEAR IN CLOSED SESSIONS. 492 CANDIDATES REGISTERED FOR THE ELECTIONS, INCLUDING 13 WOMEN.  (NOTE: INITIAL PRESS REPORTS INDICATED THAT 495 CANDIDATES REGISTERED, BUT THREE REPORTEDLY REGISTERED TWICE, MAKING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CANDIDATES 492. ENDNOTE.).  CANDIDATES MUST PASS GUARDIAN COUNCIL VETTING, AND EACH MUST BE A QUALIFIED MUJTAHED, SOMEONE WITH THE RELIGIOUS QUALIFICATIONS TO INTERPRET ISLAMIC LAW AND ISSUE RELIGIOUS DECREES.  3.(U) ACCORDING TO IRANIAN PRESS REPORTS, 204 CANDIDATES WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE A RELIGIOUS QUALIFICATIONS EXAM, OF WHICH 37 REFUSED, INCLUDING FOUR SITTING MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. REFORMIST CLERIC AND SENIOR MEMBER OF THE MILITANT CLERICS SOCIETY MAJID ANSARI WAS ONE OF THE FOUR SITTING MEMBERS WHO REFUSED TO TAKE THE EXAM, AND HIS CASE RECEIVED PARTICULAR PRESS ATTENTION BECAUSE OF CLAIMS THAT THE GUARDIAN COUNCIL WAS USING THE RELIGIOUS QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT TO BAR REFORMISTS FROM COMPETING.  ONE PRESS REPORT LATER CITED AN "INFORMED SOURCE" AS SAYING THAT ANSARI WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM HAVING TO TAKE THE EXAM, SINCE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY PASSED IT.  GUARDIAN COUNCIL VETTING WILL TAKE PLACE FROM OCTOBER 15 TO NOVEMBER 15. CANDIDATES WHO PASS THE VETTING PROCESS WILL THEN HAVE FROM NOVEMBER 30 TO DECEMBER 15 TO CAMPAIGN.  WILL WOMEN CANDIDATES BE ALLOWED? ---------------------------------  4.(U) NO WOMEN CURRENTLY SIT ON THE ASSEMBLY, AND WOMEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO RUN IN THE LAST ASSEMBLY ELECTION WERE BARRED FROM COMPETING.  IN RECENT MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN DEBATE INSIDE THE COUNTRY ABOUT WHETHER WOMEN WILL BE PERMITTED TO COMPETE THIS YEAR.  SEVERAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, INCLUDING HARD-LINE CLERIC AND CANDIDATE AYATOLLAH MOHAMMED TAQI MESBAH-YAZDI, GAVE QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA OF WOMEN'S CANDIDACIES, SAYING THAT WOMEN WHO HAD ATTAINED THE REQUISITE LEVEL OF RELIGIOUS LEARNING (I.E. QUALIFIED MUJTAHEDS) SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE.  SUCH A STATEMENT ALLOWS FOR THE APPEARANCE OF OPENNESS, BUT IN REALITY THERE ARE FEW FEMALE MUJTAHEDS.  ACCORDING TO DOMESTIC PRESS, TWO WOMEN CANDIDATES TOOK THE RELIGIOUS QUALIFICATIONS EXAM.  POWER STRUGGLE FOR ASSEMBLY AND POSSIBLY SUPREME LEADERSHIP --------------------------------------------- --------------  5.(S) THERE IS REPORTEDLY A POWER STRUGGLE BREWING FOR THE FUTURE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY BETWEEN HARD-LINE CLERIC AYATOLLAH MESBAH-YAZDI AND EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN ALI AKBAR RAFSANJANI.  MESBAH-YAZDI, WHO IS THE SPIRITUAL ADVISOR OF PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD, REGISTERED FOR THE ELECTION FOLLOWING MONTHS OF SPECULATION THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE BODY.  HE IS SUPPORTED LARGELY BY HARD-LINERS AND THOSE AFFILIATED WITH AHMADINEJAD.  RAFSANJANI, WHO IS ALSO CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS, SIGNED UP FOR THE ELECTION ON THE LAST DAY OF REGISTRATION.  RAFSANJANI IS MOSTLY SUPPORTED BY TRADITIONAL AND MODERATE CONSERVATIVES, AS WELL AS SOME REFORMISTS, WHO ARE IN THE MINORITY AMONG THE CANDIDATES FOR THE ASSEMBLY.  NASSER HADIAN, AN IRANIAN POLITICAL ANALYST, PREDICTED THAT IF THE POLITICAL MAKE-UP OF THE ASSEMBLY REMAINS B T #0011 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --  RPO DUBAI 00000011  002.3 OF 002   ESSENTIALLY THE SAME, RAFSANJANI WOULD LIKELY BECOME SUPREME LEADER WERE KHAMENEI TO BECOME INCAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT THE OFFICE.  IF MESBAH-YAZDI AND HIS SUPPORTERS WERE TO GAIN A MAJORITY IN THE ASSEMBLY, THE HARD-LINE CLERIC MAY THEN POSITION HIMSELF TO SUCCEED KHAMENEI AS SUPREME LEADER.  6.(C) THE CURRENT SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, AYATOLLAH ALI MESHKINI, REGISTERED FOR THE DECEMBER ELECTIONS, DESPITE RUMORS OF HIS FAILING HEALTH.  IT IS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN THAT MESHKINI WILL BE RE-ELECTED AND MAINTAIN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BODY, BUT BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH CONCERNS THERE IS PUBLIC SPECULATION THAT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE ANOTHER FULL 8-YEAR TERM. MESBAH-YAZDI AND RAFSANJANI ARE COMPETING FOR THE POSITION OF ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AFTER MESHKINI EVENTUALLY VACATES THE POST, WHICH WOULD GIVE EITHER MAN THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE SELECTION OF THE NEXT SUPREME LEADER IN HIS FAVOR.  WILL PEOPLE VOTE? -----------------  7.(C) OBSERVERS AND ANALYSTS, INCLUDING SEVERAL IRPO INTERLOCUTERS, PREDICT LOW VOTER TURNOUT, DESPITE THE CONCURRENT MUNICIPAL AND MAJLES BY-ELECTIONS.  THE ASSEMBLY MEETS ONLY TWICE A YEAR; ITS ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MADE PUBLIC AND APPEAR TO HAVE MINIMAL EFFECT ON THE DAILY LIVES OF IRANIANS, LEAVING THEM LITTLE INCENTIVE TO VOTE.  EVEN IN THE EUPHORIA FOLLOWING PRESIDENT MOHAMMAD KHATAMI'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION VICTORY OF 1997 WHICH FEATURED WELL OVER 80 PERCENT VOTER TURNOUT, THE 1998 ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS ELECTION ONLY ELICITED A 46 PERCENT VOTER TURNOUT, AND REGISTERED A PALTRY 37 PERCENT TURNOUT IN 1990.  8.(C) COMMENT:  THIS ELECTION WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH TO SEE IF RAFSANJANI AND REFORMERS COALESCE TO COUNTER MESBAH-YAZDI IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY OR WHETHER THERE IS IN FACT A REAL SUPPORT GROUP FOR MESBAH-YAZDI.  SEPARATELY, ONE CHALLENGE TO THE US IS HOW TO FRAME OUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT THIS ELECTION.  ON THE ONE HAND, WE ALWAYS CALL FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, AND IN THE CASE OF IRAN, SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VETTING OF CANDIDATES BY THE GUARDIAN COUNCIL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE ENTITY WHICH IS BEING ELECTED, A BODY LIMITED TO CLERICS WHOSE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY IS TO SELECT THE SUPREME LEADER.  WE FREQUENTLY CITE AS A WEAKNESS OF THE IRANIAN SYSTEM THE FACT THAT ITS LEADER IS NOT DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE POPULATION.  THIS YEAR THE ELECTION IS BEING HELD CONCURRENTLY WITH THE MUNICIPAL AND MAJLES BY-ELECTIONS, WHICH MEANS THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A BLANKET STATEMENT FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  HOWEVER, IF WE DO NOT COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS, WE GIVE THIS BODY IMPLICIT APPROVAL.  (IT MAY BE USEFUL TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW THE US COMMENTED ON THESE ELECTIONS EIGHT YEARS AGO.) WHILE POLITICAL LEADERS IN SOME DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ARE NOT DIRECTLY ELECTED, ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE INTERMEDIARY BODY IN IRAN - ALTHOUGH DIRECTLY ELECTED - IS RESTRICTED TO SENIOR CLERICS.  (NOTE:  REF A MENTIONS AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS THIS YEAR TO EXPAND MEMBERSHIP BEYOND CLERICS.)  IN OUR STATEMENTS WE SHOULD QUESTION THE RATIONALE FOR RESTRICTING THIS POWER TO CLERICS AND ASK WHY THE GOVERNMENT AVOIDS GIVING THIS POWER DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE.

PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD APPEARS TO BE CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO REORIENT UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES MORE IN LINE WITH HIS HARD-LINE IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS USING THEM FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL GAIN.  A RECENT PRESS REPORT INDICATES THAT AHMADINEJAD IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE FOUNDING COMMITTEE OF ISLAMIC AZAD UNIVERSITY (IAU).  IAU HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI AND IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS "RAFSANJANI U" (REF A).  SEPARATELY, THE CHANCELLOR OF PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY CLAIMED AHMADINEJAD IS INAPPROPRIATELY INSERTING HIMSELF INTO HIS UNIVERSITY'S ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY'S HEADQUARTERS TO BE MOVED FROM TEHRAN TO ABADAN.  THE CHANCELLOR BELIEVES THE MOTIVE IS NOT ACADEMIC BUT POLITICAL, TO APPEASE RESENTMENT IN KHUZESTAN FOR ECONOMIC INEQUITIES.  IF AHMADINEJAD SUPPLANTS RAFSANJANIS INFLUENCE OVER IAU, HE WILL HAVE SUCCEEDED BOTH AT WEAKENING HIS RIVAL AND OPENING UP MORE CAMPUSES TO HIS INFLUENCE.  END SUMMARY.  2.(U) DOMESTIC PRESS INDICATES THAT PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD IS INSERTING HIMSELF IN THE OVERSIGHT OF ISLAMIC AZAD UNIVERSITY (IAU), A MOVE THAT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF AN ONGOING POWER STRUGGLE WITH EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI. AS REPORTED IN REF A, IAU IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FOUNDING COMMITTEE (PRESUMABLY SIMILAR TO A BOARD OF TRUSTEES). WITH MORE THAN 70 CAMPUSES, IAU IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS "RAFSANJANI U."  LAST YEAR, ROOZ NEWSPAPER CLAIMED A POLITICAL SHOWDOWN WAS BUILDING BETWEEN RAFSANJANI AND AHMADINEJAD OVER CONTROL OF THE IAU SYSTEM, FEATURING CABINET ATTACKS ON IAU'S CHANCELLOR, DR. ABDOLLAH JASBI, AND CALLS FOR HIS REMOVAL. ADDITIONALLY, AHMADINEJAD CRITICIZED IAUS HIGH TUITION RATES. ROOZ SUGGESTED THAT IAU WAS THE ONLY INSTITUTION THAT AHMADINEJAD'S SUPPORTERS HAD NOT SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED, AND THESE STEPS WERE SALVOS IN A PROXY STRUGGLE BETWEEN AHMADINEJAD AND RAFSANJANI.  3.(SBU) ACCORDING TO CONSERVATIVE DAILY TEHRAN SIYASAT-E-RUZ, AHMADINEJAD APPOINTED A FIVE-MEMBER COMMITTEE TO PLAN CHANGING THE IAU FOUNDING COMMITTEE.  FIVE OF THE SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE FOUNDING COUNCIL OF IAU HAVE REPORTEDLY DIED OR RESIGNED, LEAVING ONLY EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI AND DR. JASBI.  AHMADINEJAD'S ACTIONS REPORTEDLY LED DR. JASBI TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TO RETIRE.  ACCORDING TO THE PRESS REPORT, AHMADINEJAD'S COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (SIRC), THE DECISION MAKER ON ALL CULTURAL, RESEARCH, AND EDUCATION MATTERS.  SIRC HAS REPORTEDLY LONG BEEN  DISAPPOINTED WITH IAUS EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS.  (NOTE: CONTACTS HAVE ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION OF ISLAMIC AZAD UNIVERSITIES IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF STATE UNIVERSITIES, WHILE THE PRICE IS HIGHER. ENDNOTE) THE DAILY SURMISES THAT AHMADINEJAD WILL LIKELY GARNER THE NECESSARY SUPPORT, VIA HIS COMMITTEE, TO INFLUENCE IAU ADMINISTRATION.  4.(S) OUTLINING A SEPARATE EFFORT BY AHMADINEJAD AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO USE UNIVERSITIES FOR POLITICAL ENDS, THE CHANCELLOR OF PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY TOLD IRPOFFS THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO SHIFT THE UNIVERSITY HEADQUARTERS FROM TEHRAN TO KHUZESTAN.  UNTIL RECENTLY, THE PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY HAD THREE BRANCHES, ONE IN AHVAZ, ONE IN ABADAN, AND ONE IN THE NORTH, PLUS THE MAIN CAMPUS IN TEHRAN.  THE CHANCELLOR BELIEVED HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE BEING MOVED IN AN EFFORT TO ASSUAGE KHUZESTAN PROVINCE, WHICH HAS OFTEN COMPLAINED OF NEGLECT FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  HE CALLED THE DIRECTIVE INAPPROPRIATE, NOTING THAT UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ARE SACROSANCT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A TOOL FOR POLITICAL GAIN.  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THE CHANCELLOR WAS SIMPLY PEEVED AT THE RESTRUCTURING, HE MAINTAINED THE UNIVERSITY WAS BETTER SERVED BY MORE DIRECT ACCESS TO OTHER IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS IN THE CAPITAL.  5.(U) THESE MOVES FOLLOW EARLIER REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD WAS ATTEMPTING TO PURGE LIBERAL AND SECULAR PROFESSORS FROM UNIVERSITIES.  PROFESSORS WHO ESPOUSE LIBERAL VIEWS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE HUMANITIES FIELD, WERE BEING FIRED, FORCED TO RETIRE, OR SIMPLY DENIED FULL PROFESSORSHIPS.

IF AHMADINEJAD IS SUCCESSFUL IN WRESTING CONTROL OVER IAU AWAY FROM RAFSANJANI, HE WINS TWO WAYS -- DIRECTLY DIMINISHING THE POWER OF HIS RIVAL AND OPENING NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ASSERT HIMSELF IDEOLOGICALLY OVER MORE THAN 70 CAMPUSES THAT COMPRISE THE IAU.  THE ADVICE IN REF A FROM ANOTHER UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATOR THAT IAU CAMPUSES MAY BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ENGAGE WITH THE US BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIVE INDEPENDENCE COULD BE IN QUESTION.

IF AHMADINEJAD SUPPLANTS RAFSANJANIS INFLUENCE OVER IAU, HE WILL HAVE SUCCEEDED BOTH AT WEAKENING HIS RIVAL AND OPENING UP MORE CAMPUSES TO HIS INFLUENCE.  END SUMMARY.  2.(U) DOMESTIC PRESS INDICATES THAT PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD IS INSERTING HIMSELF IN THE OVERSIGHT OF ISLAMIC AZAD UNIVERSITY (IAU), A MOVE THAT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF AN ONGOING POWER STRUGGLE WITH EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI. AS REPORTED IN REF A, IAU IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FOUNDING COMMITTEE (PRESUMABLY SIMILAR TO A BOARD OF TRUSTEES). WITH MORE THAN 70 CAMPUSES, IAU IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS &quot;RAFSANJANI U.&quot;  LAST YEAR, ROOZ NEWSPAPER CLAIMED A POLITICAL SHOWDOWN WAS BUILDING BETWEEN RAFSANJANI AND AHMADINEJAD OVER CONTROL OF THE IAU SYSTEM, FEATURING CABINET ATTACKS ON IAU&#39;S CHANCELLOR, DR. ABDOLLAH JASBI, AND CALLS FOR HIS REMOVAL. ADDITIONALLY, AHMADINEJAD CRITICIZED IAUS HIGH TUITION RATES. ROOZ SUGGESTED THAT IAU WAS THE ONLY INSTITUTION THAT AHMADINEJAD&#39;S SUPPORTERS HAD NOT SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED, AND THESE STEPS WERE SALVOS IN A PROXY STRUGGLE BETWEEN AHMADINEJAD AND RAFSANJANI.  3.(SBU) ACCORDING TO CONSERVATIVE DAILY TEHRAN SIYASAT-E-RUZ, AHMADINEJAD APPOINTED A FIVE-MEMBER COMMITTEE TO PLAN CHANGING THE IAU FOUNDING COMMITTEE.  FIVE OF THE SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE FOUNDING COUNCIL OF IAU HAVE REPORTEDLY DIED OR RESIGNED, LEAVING ONLY EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL CHAIR ALI HASHEMI RAFSANJANI AND DR. JASBI.  AHMADINEJAD&#39;S ACTIONS REPORTEDLY LED DR. JASBI TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TO RETIRE.  ACCORDING TO THE PRESS REPORT, AHMADINEJAD&#39;S COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (SIRC), THE DECISION MAKER ON ALL CULTURAL, RESEARCH, AND EDUCATION MATTERS.  SIRC HAS REPORTEDLY LONG BEEN  DISAPPOINTED WITH IAUS EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS.  (NOTE: CONTACTS HAVE ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION OF ISLAMIC AZAD UNIVERSITIES IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF STATE UNIVERSITIES, WHILE THE PRICE IS HIGHER. ENDNOTE) THE DAILY SURMISES THAT AHMADINEJAD WILL LIKELY GARNER THE NECESSARY SUPPORT, VIA HIS COMMITTEE, TO INFLUENCE IAU ADMINISTRATION.  4.(S) OUTLINING A SEPARATE EFFORT BY AHMADINEJAD AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO USE UNIVERSITIES FOR POLITICAL ENDS, THE CHANCELLOR OF PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY TOLD IRPOFFS THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO SHIFT THE UNIVERSITY HEADQUARTERS FROM TEHRAN TO KHUZESTAN.  UNTIL RECENTLY, THE PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY HAD THREE BRANCHES, ONE IN AHVAZ, ONE IN ABADAN, AND ONE IN THE NORTH, PLUS THE MAIN CAMPUS IN TEHRAN.  THE CHANCELLOR BELIEVED HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE BEING MOVED IN AN EFFORT TO ASSUAGE KHUZESTAN PROVINCE, WHICH HAS OFTEN COMPLAINED OF NEGLECT FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  HE CALLED THE DIRECTIVE INAPPROPRIATE, NOTING THAT UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ARE SACROSANCT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A TOOL FOR POLITICAL GAIN.  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THE CHANCELLOR WAS SIMPLY PEEVED AT THE RESTRUCTURING, HE MAINTAINED THE UNIVERSITY WAS BETTER SERVED BY MORE DIRECT ACCESS TO OTHER IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS IN THE CAPITAL.  5.(U) THESE MOVES FOLLOW EARLIER REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD WAS ATTEMPTING TO PURGE LIBERAL AND SECULAR PROFESSORS FROM UNIVERSITIES.  PROFESSORS WHO ESPOUSE LIBERAL VIEWS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE HUMANITIES FIELD, WERE BEING FIRED, FORCED TO RETIRE, OR SIMPLY DENIED FULL PROFESSORSHIPS. PROFESSORS ARE ALSO GIVEN INCENTIVES TO SPEND THEIR SABBATICALS

REASON: 1.4 (D)  1.(S/NF) SUMMARY: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICERS MET NOVEMBER 22 WITH A GROUP OF PROMINENT DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, IN DUBAI FOR VISAS FOR A US CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF REFORM IN IRAN.  ON ONE HAND, THE ACTIVISTS LAUDED SUPPORT FROM THE US FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN.  FORMER POLITICAL PRISONER HASHEM AGHAJARI CITED US PRESSURE, AS WELL AS PRESSURE FROM OTHER SOURCES, AS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE OVERTURNING OF HIS DEATH SENTENCE AND HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON.  ON THE OTHER, THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN THE US WOULD TRY TO IMPOSE DEMOCRACY IN IRAN, OR CONVERSELY FORGET ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IF IT REACHED A DEAL WITH THE CURRENT REGIME.  THEY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR US CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE EFFORTS CENTERED IN DUBAI AND ENCOURAGED GREATER US UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN.  THEY SAID UPCOMING ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS ELECTIONS CARRY LITTLE IMPORT FOR ELITES AND INTELLECTUALS, BUT POORER IRANIANS ARE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE. BY CONTRAST, THEY NOTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  THEY NOTED INCREASING LIMITS ON THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN PRESIDENT KHATAMI.  END SUMMARY.  2.(S/NF) ON NOVEMBER 22, IRPO DIRECTOR AND IRPOFFS MET WITH A GROUP OF FOUR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO WERE IN DUBAI APPLYING FOR US VISAS.  POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AND FORMER POLITICAL PRISONER HASHEM AGHAJARI, STUDENT ACTIVIST ABDOLLAH MOMENI, WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST MARZIEH MORTEZA LANGEROUDI, AND JOURNALIST ALIREZA RAJAI (STRICTLY PROTECT ALL NAMES) PLAN TO ATTEND A FEBRUARY 2007 CONFERENCE ON DEMOCRACY AND REFORM, ORGANIZED BY FORMER MP FATEMEH HAGHIGHATJOO AT MIT. WHEN ASKED THE TOPIC OF HIS PRESENTATION, AGHAJARI SAID HE WOULD ADDRESS THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRACY AND RELIGION IN IRAN, AND THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN REFORM AND DEMOCRACY.  (NOTE: RAJAI MADE NO SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS DURING THE MEETING. ENDNOTE)  GRATEFUL FOR US PRESSURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, FUTURE CONCERNS --------------------------------------------- ------------  3.(S/NF) WHEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT BROUGHT ABOUT THE OVERTURNING OF HIS DEATH SENTENCE AND HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 2004, AGHAJARI CITED BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, INCLUDING FROM THE US, FROM GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS MASS MEDIA. WHEN ASKED IF HE THOUGHT PRESSURE FROM THE US CAN HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON A HUMAN RIGHTS CASE, HE DISAGREED. NONETHELESS, SEVERAL ACTIVISTS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF THE US COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  AGHAJARI FELT THE US APPLIED PRESSURE SELECTIVELY ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ASKED WHETHER THE US WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN IF THE TWO COUNTRIES CAME TO AGREEMENT ON OTHER KEY ISSUES.  IRPO DIRECTOR REITERATED THE US COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHT AND DEMOCRACY, EXPLAINING THAT PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY IN US FOREIGN POLICY.  US AND DEMOCRACY IN IRAN ------------------------  4.(S/NF) WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST LANGEROUDI MAINTAINED THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE US SPONSORED 1953 COUP OF PRIME MINISTER MOHAMMAD MOSSADEQ, SHE WOULD BE LIVING TODAY IN A DEMOCRACY. SHE COMMENTED THAT IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY, THE PEOPLE DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM, AND THAT THE ALTERNATIVE, WHERE LEADERS MAKE ALL THE DETERMINATIONS, IS CALLED "SULTANISM."  SHE ALSO EXPRESSED SUSPICION THAT US MOTIVES IN IRAQ WERE FOCUSED ON OIL, NOT DEMOCRACY.  AGHAJARI ADDED THAT DEMOCRACY SHOULD COME FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY.  IRAN IS A RELIGIOUS COUNTRY, LIKE THE US, AND THAT DEMOCRACY IN IRAN MUST HAVE A RELIGIOUS ELEMENT.  HE STATED THAT A COMPLETE SECULAR DEMOCRACY WOULD INSULT IRANIANS' RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  5.(S/NF) AGHAJARI CONTINUED THAT IRANIANS ARE NOT AGAINST THE US AND, AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PUBLIC OPINION POLL THAT GOT ABBAS ABDI THROWN IN PRISON, THE MAJORITY SUPPORT RESTORATION OF TIES WITH THE US.  NONETHELESS, THE IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE PROUD AND WISH TO BE INDEPENDENT AND MAINTAIN THEIR NATIONAL DIGNITY.  IRANIANS ARE SUSPICIOUS OF INTERVENTION, HE COMMENTED.  HE ADVISED THAT THE US SHOULD NOT TAKE STEPS THAT LOOK LIKE IT WANTS TO INTERVENE OR DICTATE.  HE CLAIMED THAT IRANIANS ARE CURRENTLY TESTING THE US, AND THAT IF US POLICIES ARE CONTRADICTORY OR IF IT APPEARS THE US IS DOING THINGS FOR ITS OWN BENEFIT IN THE REGION, THERE WILL BE DISTRUST AND SUSPICION.  NOTING THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE NUCLEAR ISSUE, HE SAID THAT UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE GOOD FOR BOTH SIDES, WHILE CONFLICT WOULD BE BAD FOR B T #0014 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --  RPO DUBAI 00000014  002.3 OF 003   BOTH SIDES.  IN GENERAL, HE ADDED, IT WOULD BENEFIT THE US IF THERE WERE AN END TO WAR AND TERROR IN THE REGION AND IF THE REGIONAL COUNTRIES HAD GREATER CAPACITY, RATHER THAN POVERTY.  SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASED FOCUS ON IRAN -------------------------------------  6.(S/NF) AGHAJARI EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA OF DUBAI AS A CENTER FOR US CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES WITH IRANIANS. HE COMMENTED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN OUTSIDE OF IRAN FOR OVER 27 YEARS AND SHOULD IMPROVE ITS KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY. AGHAJARI ASSERTED THAT BETTER US UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN WOULD HELP TO BRING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION.  POORER IRANIANS MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS --------------------------------------------- ----------  7.(S/NF)  REGARDING THE DECEMBER 15 ELECTIONS FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS, THE BODY THAT SELECTS AND NOMINALLY SUPERVISES THE SUPREME LEADER, AGHAJARI COMMENTED THAT URBAN ELITES AND INTELLECTUALS DO NOT TAKE THE ELECTIONS SERIOUSLY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, PARTICIPATION IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES, WHO TEND TO BE MORE RELIGIOUS.  AGHAJARI NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS ELECTIONS HOLD LITTLE IMPORTANCE, THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS ARE OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE.  THE COUNCILS HAVE GREATER PUBLIC SUPPORT THAN THAT ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS, HE NOTED, AND FOR THIS REASON THE GOVERNMENT HELD THE ELECTIONS FOR BOTH BODIES CONCURRENTLY, IN A BID TO INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION.  AGHAJARI COMMENTED THAT REFORMISTS ARE UNLIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS BUT MADE NO MENTION OF AN ORGANIZED ELECTION BOYCOTT BY REFORMISTS. WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST LANGEROUDI TOLD IRPOFFS THAT SHE WOULD NOT VOTE.  ASKED ABOUT VETTING OF CANDIDATES FOR THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS, MOMENI CONFIRMED THAT CANDIDATES ARE BEING VETTED BY THE MAJLES, RATHER THAN THE GUARDIAN COUNCIL OR THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. (NOTE: IRANIAN DOMESTIC PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT MUNICIPAL COUNCIL CANDIDATES ARE BEING VETTED BY A MAJLES-APPOINTED "CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR MONITORING COUNCIL ELECTIONS." AS OF NOVEMBER 29, NO NAMES OR FIGURES HAVE BEEN RELEASED REGARDING QUALIFICATION OF MUNICIPAL CANDIDATES. ENDNOTE)  INCREASED RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON ACTIVISTS ------------------------------------------  8.(S/NF) THE ACTIVISTS NOTED INCREASED LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVISTS (ALTHOUGH THEY NOTABLY DEFLECTED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY EXPECTED REPERCUSSIONS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MIT CONFERENCE).  CITING A PERSONAL EXAMPLE, AGHAJARI SAID THAT DIRECTORS OF ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS ARE USUALLY CHOSEN BY THE DEPARTMENT STAFF, BUT WHEN HE WAS CHOSEN TO HEAD THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT, THE GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY INTERVENED AND APPOINTED SOMEONE ELSE.  AGHAJARI ALSO NOTED A FREE SPEECH RALLY HELD IN LATE NOVEMBER BY STUDENTS AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY, SAYING THAT HE WAS PREVENTED FROM SPEAKING AT THAT EVENT, BUT OTHERS SPOKE ON HIS BEHALF.  (NOTE: SEE REFTEL FOR MORE ON INTERFERENCE BY THE GOVERNMENT IN UNIVERSITY AFFAIRS. ENDNOTE)  IRAN'S DISAPPOINTED REFORMISTS ------------------------------  9.(S/NF) STUDENT ACTIVIST MOMENI, WHO DESCRIBED HIS OWN FIVE YEAR SUSPENDED SENTENCE FOR HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND 50 DAYS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DETAILED REFORMISTS' DISAPPOINTMENT WITH PRESIDENT KHATAMI.  MOMENI DID NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT MANY PROTEST LEADERS WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON DURING KHATAMIS PRESIDENCY.  HE SAID STUDENT SUPPORT FOR KHATAMI IN THE 1997 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN HIS ELECTORAL SUCCESS.  KHATAMI HAD TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO BRING ABOUT REFORM, BUT HE DISAPPOINTED HIS SUPPORTERS AND SIDED WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THE STUDENTS WITHDREW THEIR SUPPORT FOR KHATAMI IN THE 2001 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BECAUSE OF HIS INABILITY TO STAND UP TO THE GOVERNMENT.  NONETHELESS,  MANY STILL REGARD KHATAMI AS OPEN-MINDED AND A TRUE INTELLECTUAL, IN CONTRAST TO AHMADINEJAD OR RAFSANJANI, MOMENI SAID.  10.(S/NF) COMMENT:  IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT EVEN AMONG  IRANIANS WHO ARE CRITICAL OF THEIR GOVERNMENT, THERE IS STILL SKEPTICISM OF THE MOTIVATIONS OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND A FEAR OF FOREIGN INTERVENTION. AMONG IRANIANS, THIS SKEPTICISM HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD RUSSIA AND GREAT BRITAIN, BUT ALSO EXTENDS TO THE US, AS THE MENTION OF THE 1953 COUP AGAINST MOSSADEQ INDICATES.  IT IS ALSO INTERESTING  THAT A PERSON SUCH AS B T #0014 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --  RPO DUBAI 00000014  003.3 OF 003   AGHAJARI, WHO HAS BEEN PERSECUTED AND IMPRISONED BY THE CLERICAL GOVERNMENT FOR HIS VIEWS OF ISLAM, CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE FOR A ROLE FOR RELIGION WITHIN A FUTURE DEMOCRATIC IRAN.  11.(S/NF) COMMENT CONTINUED:  MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WERE RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE ON THE TOPIC OF POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MIT CONFERENCE.  AGHAJARI AND MOMENI DISMISSED THE QUESTION, CLAIMING THEY HAD NOT THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT IT.  AGHAJARI SAID SIMPLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE BEHAVIOR OF AHMADINEJAD'S GOVERNMENT.  THEIR RELUCTANCE MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO CONCERNS THAT THEIR RESPONSES WOULD AFFECT THEIR VISA APPLICATIONS BUT BEARS MENTIONING NONETHELESS. BURNS B T #0014 N -- END OF ERRORED MESSAGE --

REASON: 1.4 (D)  1.(S) SUMMARY.  EXPERTS AND OBSERVERS AGREE THAT WITH THE ELECTION OF FORMER IRGC OFFICER MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD TO THE PRESIDENCY IN 2005, THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS (IRGC) IS ON THE UPSURGE.  IT HAS ALSO AMASSED ECONOMIC POWER, PARTICULARLY SINCE AHMADINEJADS ELECTION.  UNLEASHED AFTER YEARS OF CURBS ON ITS OVERT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES UNDER PRESIDENT KHATAMI, IT BEGAN WINNING LARGER CONTRACTS, WHILE CIRCUMVENTING GOVERNMENT TENDERING PROCEDURES. THE KHATAM AL-ANBIYA RECONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATION (A COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED BY THE IRGC AND HEADED BY IRGC GENERAL ABDOLREZA ABED) IS REPORTEDLY THE LARGEST BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC TRUST IN THE COUNTRY.  IT RECENTLY SIGNED A DEAL WORTH $7 BILLION WITH IRAN'S MINISTRY OF OIL.  ACCORDING TO GENERAL ABED, 30 PERCENT OF IRGC FORCES ARE CURRENTLY DEVOTED TO SUPPORTING ECONOMIC AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  THE VAST SUMS OF MONEY GAINED FROM SUCH PROJECTS REPORTEDLY NOT ONLY LINE THE POCKETS OF PAST AND PRESENT IRGC MEMBERS, BUT STREAMLINE THE ACQUISITION OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND POSSIBLY FUND OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  NONETHELESS, A PROMINENT IRANIAN ECONOMIC ANALYST INFERRED THAT BONYADS WERE A MORE LIKELY SOURCE OF TERRORIST FUNDING, DRAWING ON MASSIVE RELIGIOUS TAXES.  END SUMMARY.  ASSUMING GREATER POLITICAL POWER ----------------------------------------  2.(S) IN JUNE 2004, THE ECONOMIST REPORTED THAT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS (IRGC) OR "SEPAH-YE PASDARAN-E ENQELAB-E ISLAMI"  MAY BE "QUIETLY TAKING CONTROL," WITH THE CONSERVATIVES' BLESSING IN THE FACE OF WANING CLERICAL PRESTIGE.  THE ECONOMIST NOTED THAT THE IRGC SUCCESSFULLY HELPED AHMADINEJAD BECOME MAYOR OF TEHRAN IN 2003 AND SOME 90 FORMER IRGC MEMBERS GET ELECTED INTO THE 2004 7TH PARLIAMENT OUT OF A TOTAL OF 290 MEMBERS.  OTHER INDICATIONS OF IRGC INFLUENCE RECEIVED INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION AS WELL.  THE TIMES 2004 ARTICLE ASSERTED THAT THE IRGC HELD THE KEY TO THE NUCLEAR DISPUTE AS IT CONTROLS THE IRIG'S STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE SHAHAB MISSILE PROGRAM AND VITAL PARTS OF THE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY EFFORT. THE ARTICLE ALSO NOTED THAT THE IRGC GREATLY INFLUENCED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCES (LEF) AND NOTED CONTROL OF T NATIONAL TV AND RADIO BY FORMER IRGC MEMBER ALI LARIJANI.  THE TIMES ARTICLE CLAIMED THAT THE IRGC DOMINATED THE MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE AND INTELLIGENCE AS WELL. (COMMENT: THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CASE WELL INTO THE LATE NINETIES UNTIL FORMER PRESIDENT KHATAMI'S REFORMISTS WERE ABLE TO WREST CONTROL OF THE MINISTRY OF INTELLIGENCE AWAY FROM THE HARDLINERS.  END COMMENT.)  SINCE HIS ELECTION, AHMADINEJAD HAS BROUGHT BACK MANY OF THE SAME IRGC VETS THAT KHATAMI WORKED SO HARD AT GETTING RID OF FROM THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, AS WELL AS NAMING NUMEROUS OTHER RETIRED IRGC MEMBERS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICE.  GAINING ECONOMIC CLOUT ----------------------  3.(S)  THE IRGC HAS BEEN AMASSING ECONOMIC POWER SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  THIS TREND GREATLY ACCELERATED DURING THE 1990S, WHEN THE IRGC PROFITED FROM BRIBES FROM THE LUCRATIVE IRAQI OIL SMUGGLING TRADE DURING THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO NUMEROUS CONTACTS, THE IRGC COMMAND GREW TO RESENT THE LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLES AND ENDEMIC CORRUPTION OF THE POST-REVOLUTIONARY CLERICAL CLASS DURING THESE YEARS, AS EMBODIED BY FORMER PRESIDENT HASHEMI RAFSANJANI.  THE IRGC REPORTEDLY FELT THEIR SACRIFICES WERE BEING SQUANDERED BY OTHERS AND MOVED TO CAPTURE A GREATER SLICE OF IRAN'S WEALTH AND POWER.   4.(U) THE FIRST MAJOR PUBLIC INDICATION OF IRGC ASSERTIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY CAME WHEN IT SUCCESSFULLY CLOSED DOWN THE NEWLY-BUILT IMAM KHOMEINI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN MAY 2004, AFTER CITING "SECURITY CONCERNS" WITH THE FOREIGN OPERATOR, TURKISH FIRM TAV.  THE REAL REASON WAS SUPPOSEDLY RELATED INSTEAD TO CONTRACT ISSUES.  THE 2004 ECONOMIST ARTICLE MENTIONED FAILED ATTEMPTS BY THE PREVIOUS REFORMIST PARLIAMENT TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED MISUSE OF IRGC JETTIES TO SMUGGLE IN EMBARGOED GOODS.  IN THE ARTICLE, TRADE ANALYST KHOSRO NASIRZADEH ESTIMATED THAT SOME 72 JETTIES WERE OPERATING ILLEGALLY, BRINGING IN $9.5 BILLION ANNUALLY.  THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE, WRITTEN BY VALI NASR AND ALI GHEISSARI, CLAIMED THAT THE IRGC HAD A MONOPOLY OVER BLACK MARKET TRADE IN EMBARGOED GOODS, INCLUDING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, WESTERN CLOTHING, AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.  PARIS INTELLIGENCE ONLINE CLAIMED JULY 7, 2006 THAT THE IRGC IS GIVEN AN ANNUAL QUOTA OF  RPO DUBAI 00000015  002.3 OF 004   OIL PRODUCTS TO SMUGGLE INTO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES (IRAQ, TURKEY, PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN), NETTING ANOTHER $1 BILLION PER YEAR.  NASR AND GHEISSARI ASSERTED THAT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS REVENUE REMOVED BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS OVER ITS SPENDING ON WEAPONS AND AID TO FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS.   KHATAM AL ANBIYA RECONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATION - IRGC'S MAIN ECONOMIC ENTITY --------------------------------------------- -------------- ----------------  5.(U) ON JUNE 26, 2006 SHARQ (NOTE: REFORMIST IRANIAN PAPER CLOSED IN OCTOBER 2006.  ENDNOTE) INTERVIEWED IRGC BRIGADIER GENERAL ABDOLREZA ABED,  THE ACTING COMMANDER OF THE IRGC'S KHATAM AL ANBIYA RECONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATION.  THIS ENTITY WAS ESTABLISHED AFTER THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR TO ADVANCE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY AND ECONOMIC EFFORTS.  ABED, AS QUOTED BY SHARQ, CITED ARTICLE 47 OF THE CONSTITUTION STIPULATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRED TO EMPLOY ARMED FORCES IN RECONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION EFFORTS DURING TIMES OF PEACE.  HE CLAIMED THAT 30 PERCENT OF IRGC FORCES ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES.  HE FURTHER ASSERTED THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF WAR, THE IRGC'S ECONOMIC ARM COULD CONTINUE TO MEET ITS DEADLINES AND ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  6.(S) ABED STATED THAT SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1989, THE KHATAM AL ANBIYA RECONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATION HAS COMPLETED 1,220 SMALL PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS WORTH A TOTAL OF $2.7 TO $3.2 MILLION.  AT THE TIME OF THE JUNE 2006 INTERVIEW, HE SAID THE IRGC WAS INVOLVED IN 247 PROJECTS WORTH AROUND $2 BILLION AND WAS ABOUT TO SIGN SEVERAL LUCRATIVE DEALS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR.  WHEN ASKED WHY THE IRGC WAS STARTING TO MOVE AWAY FROM MORE TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS - AND MOVE TOWARD THE ENERGY SECTOR - ABED SAID, "OUR STRATEGY IS TO SERVE.  WE MUST STEP IN WHEREVER THERE IS A MONOPOLY."  HOWEVER, AN IRANIAN ECONOMIC ANALYST TOLD ECONOFF THAT INSTEAD, PRESIDENT KHATAMI HAD THWARTED IRGC ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR, A PROHIBITION THEN LIFTED BY HIS SUCCESSOR.  AND RATHER THAN PROMOTING COMPETITION, THE CONTACT SAID, THE IRGC IS ABLE TO UNDERBID COMPETITORS BECAUSE OF THE COMPARATIVELY LOWER WAGES IT PAYS ITS SOLDIER-EMPLOYEES.  THE ANALYST ALSO NOTED THAT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST OF DRAFTEES ARE OFTEN FUNNELED INTO IRGC'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES.  AN IRANIAN CONSTRUCTION SECTOR CONTACT EXPRESSED THE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES GROWING FRUSTRATION TO IRPOFF WITH THE IRGC'S INSIDER ACCESS TO LUCRATIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IN MANY FIELDS AND ACCUSED THE IRGC OF UNFAVORABLE PERFORMANCE ON LARGE CONTRACTS.  IN A CLAIM THAT CANNOT BE VERIFIED, ANOTHER IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN MAINTAINED THAT THE IRGC SKIMS 10 PERCENT OFF OF ALL FOREIGN CONTRACTS.  7.(U) A JULY 4, 2006 ROOZ ONLINE ARTICLE CALLED THE KHATAM AL ANBIYA RECONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATION  THE LARGEST BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC TRUST IN IRAN.  AS REPORTED BY ROOZ, IT SIGNED A $7 BILLION AGREEMENT WITH THE MINISTRY OF OIL, AND IT PURCHASED SHARES OF ORIENTAL OIL KISH (ONE OF IRAN'S LARGEST PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES).  PARIS INTELLIGENCE ONLINE REPORTED JULY 7, 2006 THAT THE IRGC SIGNED THREE ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS:  $2.09 BILLION TO DEVELOP THE 15TH AND 16TH PHASES OF SOUTH PARS GAS FIELD, $2 BILLION TO BUILD A SUBWAY IN TEHRAN, AND $1.3 BILLION TO CONSTRUCT A 900 KM PIPELINE BETWEEN PARS JONUBI AND THE CITY OF IRANSHAHR.  8.(U) ACCORDING TO THE JUNE SHARQ INTERVIEW, THE PIPELINE PROJECT WAS AWARDED VIA A NO-BID CONTRACT.  WHEN SHARQ QUESTIONED GENERAL ABED AS TO WHY THE DEAL DID NOT GO TO TENDER, ABED REPLIED "THEY HAVE SEEN OUR WORK.  WE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOR THEM TO BE WILLING TO AWARD US THE CONTRACT WITHOUT BIDDING."  VARIOUS NEWS SOURCES ALSO REPORTED THAT THE SOUTH PARS PROJECT AND SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION WERE HANDED OVER TO THE IRGC WITHOUT A TENDERING PROCESS - A MOVE THAT EVEN ANGERED THE REGULAR ARMY.  REACTING TO THESE NO-TENDER CONTRACTS, ARMY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SALEHI REPORTEDLY COMPLAINED THAT WHILE THE IRGC HAS "ECONOMIC PRIVILEGES," THE REGULAR ARMY IS FACING DWINDLING BUDGETS AND OBSOLETE ARMAMENTS, ACCORDING TO THE JULY 7 PARIS INTELLIGENCE ONLINE ARTICLE.  OTHER OPPORTUNITIES -----------------------  9.(S) IRANIAN BUSINESS CONTACTS REPORT THAT AHMADINEJAD'S PROGRAM OF TRANSFERRING GREATER POWER TO PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR EXPANDING IRGC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER.  (NOTE.  DESPITE STRONG CRITICISM, AHMADINEJAD RECENTLY TRANSFERRED CONTROL OF THE PREVIOUSLY CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING ORGANIZATION BUDGET TO  THE PROVINCES.  ENDNOTE.)  FOR  RPO DUBAI 00000015  003.3 OF 004   EXAMPLE, THE GOVERNOR OF ISFAHAN PROVINCE WAS REPORTEDLY ORDERED RECENTLY TO IMMEDIATELY DIVERT CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC FUNDS TO "DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS," ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WHO HAD RECENTLY VISITED IRAN.  CLAIMING AS HIS CONTACT A HIGH LEVEL OFFICIAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE, HE SAID THE GOVERNOR WAS ANGRY AT BEING ORDERED TO PRODUCE MONEY OUT OF HIS OWN COFFERS FOR THESE PROJECTS, WHICH WERE BEING IMPLEMENTED  WITHOUT PROPER PLANNING.  THE IRGC WAS REPORTEDLY SET TO RECEIVE SOME OF THESE PROJECT CONTRACTS.  10.(U) ROOZ ONLINE CLAIMED ON JULY 11, 2006 THAT IRGC COMMANDERS REQUESTED THAT COMPANIES UP FOR PRIVATIZATION UNDER THE NEW PRIVATIZATION LAW BE DIRECTED TOWARDS IRGC MEMBERS AND THEIR RELATIVES.  SOME OF THE COMPANIES CITED AS TARGETS INCLUDE: MOBARAKE STEEL PLANT IN ISFAHAN, IRAN KHODRO CAR MANUFACTURING PLANT, SAIPA CAR MANUFACTURING, KHUZESTAN STEEL CORP, TEJARAT BANK, MELLAT BANK, SADERAT BANK, REFAH BANK, ALL SHIPPING COMPANIES, HOMA AIRLINES, ASSEMAN AIRLINES, ASIA INSURANCE COMPANY, DANA INSURANCE COMPANY AND ALBORZ INSURANCE COMPANY. FURTHERMORE, ROOZ ALLEGED THAT THE MINISTRY OF POWER "UNLAWFULLY" GRANTED ALL ITS POWER AND WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO THE IRGC WITHOUT FOLLOWING WRITTEN PROCEDURES FOR SUCH TRANSFERS.  (NOTE: ROOZ CLAIMS THAT AHMADINEJAD'S MINISTER OF POWER IS A FORMER IRGC MEMBER AND CONTRACTOR FOR THE KARKHEH DAM.  HE HAS ALSO SERVED AS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF AN ELECTRICITY DEVELOPING COMPANY AND AS CHAIRMAN OF IRGC OWNED MALEK-E ASHTAR UNIVERSITY.  ENDNOTE)  USE OR LOSE -------------  11.(U) IN THE JUNE INTERVIEW WITH SHARQ, GENERAL ABED ADMITTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE $2 BILLION FUNDING FOR THE SOUTH PARS PROJECT WOULD COME FROM THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVE ACCOUNT. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVE WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT 50 PERCENT WOULD REMAIN AS RESERVES AND 50 PERCENT WOULD BE LOANED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  THE SHARQ REPORTER QUESTIONED HOW THE IRGC OBTAINED FUNDS EARMARKED FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS.  ABED REPLIED SIMPLY, "THE FUNDS EXIST TODAY, THEY MIGHT NOT TOMORROW."  ECONOMIST BAHMAN ARMAN WARNED IN AN AFTABNEWS ARTICLE NOVEMBER 21, 2006 THAT IRAN'S CURRENT INFLATION WOES ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF GOVERNMENT WITHDRAWALS FROM THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVE FUND TO MEET THE COSTS OF ITS CURRENT EXPENDITURES.  12.(U) IN AUGUST 2006,  THE IRGC PLAYED A ROLE IN A HOSTILE SEIZURE OF A ROMANIAN OIL RIG WORKING OFF THE COAST OF IRAN. THE RIG WAS OWNED BY A ROMANIAN, SUPPOSEDLY RENTED BY A FORMER IRGC MEMBER AND DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS OWNER OF ORIENTAL OIL COMPANY, LEASED TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, WITH THE DEAL FINANCED BY BANK SADERAT AND CREDIT SUISSE.  WHEN THE ROMANIAN OWNER ATTEMPTED TO RECLAIM HIS RIG AFTER A DEFAULT ON THE PAYMENT,  IRANIAN MILITARY VESSELS, ALLEGEDLY CONTAINING IRGC MEMBERS, PULLED ALONGSIDE IT, JUMPED ON, AND TOOK CONTROL.  NOW TANGLED IN LEGAL BATTLES, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE FATE OF THE RIG WILL BE.  AN OCTOBER 14, 2006 WALL STREET JOURNAL ON IRGC INVOLVEMENT IN THE IRANIAN ECONOMY CONCLUDED THAT A "FEARED FORCE ROILS BUSINESS IN IRAN."  IT CLAIMED THAT THE BANK DEFAULT MAY HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO USG EFFORTS TO  PRESS INTERNATIONAL BANKS TO STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH SADERAT.  13.(S) COMMENT.  OUR OVERALL LACK OF ACCESS TO PEOPLE WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF IRGC ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MEANS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND RELIABLE INFORMATION, SUCH AS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF IRGC PROFITS GOES INTO INDIVIDUAL POCKETS, WHAT PERCENTAGE IS SPENT SUPPORTING WEAPONS ACQUISITIONS, AND WHAT PERCENTAGE GOES TOWARD SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.  A LONG-TIME CONTACT, AN ECONOMIC ANALYST, INFERRED THE DEEP, MURKY POCKETS OF BONYADS ARE A MORE LIKELY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR TERRORISM THAN THE IRGC.  HE SAID THE KHATAM AL-ANBIYA BEARS SOME SIMILARITY TO THE US ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS.  HE MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS A NATURAL EXTENSION IN PEACETIME TO USE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ACCRUED DURING WARTIME FOR THE COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  FURTHERMORE, DESPITE ITS IRGC TIES, IT IS A COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THEREFORE IS AUDITED. SOME OF ITS INCOME IS REINVESTED, SOME OF IT LINES POCKETS, AND A SMALL PORTION MAY BE USED FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES.  THE ECONOMIST IMPLIED, HOWEVER, THAT THE RELIGIOUS TAX REVENUES GOING TO BONYADS IS "MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE."  14.(S) COMMENT CON'T: A FEW OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE REFERRED TO THE IRGCS GROWING POWER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, WHICH THEY VIEW AS INSTRUMENTAL IN DELIVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY TO AHMADINEJAD, AS A "CREEPING MILITARY COUP," AIMED AT TAKING POWER OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE CLERICS.  THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF  RPO DUBAI 00000015  004.3 OF 004   THIS POWER SHIFT ON US INTERESTS REMAINS UNCLEAR.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary: At the 2006 Arab Strategy Forum in Dubai, Iranian National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani delivered a speech calculated to create doubt in the minds of Arab leaders about the value of their relationship with the US, and to present Iran as a more attractive ally.  Larijani called for US withdrawal from Iraq and made other key points:  1) Iran is not a threat to the region, rather its most effective leader;  2) Arab countries should join with Iran to seek regional solutions for regional security problems, rather than relying on the US; 3) US attempts at blocking Iran's nuclear program will be a precedent for blocking programs in Arab countries.  Underlying Larijani's comments was the idea that Iran is a more appropriate ally and leader for the Middle East region than the US because Iran shares a common Muslim heritage with its Arab neighbors. Iran has made this pitch before, but Larijani's comments mark an unusually direct overture to the Arab world.  Contacts report, however, that Iran is unlikely to win converts.  That said, we should continue to emphasize with our Arab partners the benefits of alliance with the US versus Iran, as well as give long-term assurances that any eventual change in the relationship between US and Iran would not come at their expense.  To counter Ahmadinejad's street appeal, we should continue to point out that Iran does not offer a positive vision for the region, only a negative one.  End Summary  Larijani's Key Points ---------------------  2.(C) According to press reports and reports from spectators, Larijani made three key points in his December 5 speech at the Arab Strategy Forum, under the auspices of UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid al-Maktoum (MbR).  The annual conference brings together prominent leaders, business executives, and scholars to discuss political and economic strategies for the Middle East.  -- Iran is not a threat to the region.  Instead Iran can be the region's most effective leader.  "Some countries consider Iran a threat to the region, forgetting about Israel," Larijani said. He later insisted, "We are not after a nuclear bomb."  At the same time, he called for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq. Larijani's remarks are part of a concerted effort to press for Iranian leadership of the region, at the same time reiterating common criticisms of the US and Israel.  -- Arab countries should join Iran in security cooperation, and regional security problems should be resolved by the region without outside help.  "The security and stability of the region needs to be attained and we should do it inside the region, not through bringing in foreign forces...We should stand on our own feet," he said.  The remarks were designed to make Arab leaders question the nature of their relationships with the US.  He continued, "We don't accept the relationship between the US and the countries of the region.  If you talk to Arab leaders here, you can sense that they aren't happy with the current situation.  They feel the Americans are bullies.  They don't want the US Ambassador ordering them around."  -- If the US succeeds at constraining Iran's nuclear program, Arab countries will be vulnerable to the same pressure.  Were Iran to abandon its enrichment program and agree to import its nuclear fuel, a precedent would be set and similar restrictions would be placed on the potential nuclear programs of Arab nations.  "They will allow you to have a power plant, but they will keep the fuel," he said.  Underlying Larijani's comments was the idea that Iran is a more appropriate ally and leader for the Middle East region than the US because Iran shares a common Muslim heritage with its Arab neighbors.  Iran's Regional Focus in Foreign Policy ---------------------------------------  3.(C) Since the election of President Ahmadinejad, Iranian foreign policy has shifted a great deal of its focus away from relations with Western countries and toward the Muslim world, particularly its Arab neighbors.  Iran has sent a constant stream of envoys to Gulf states in an attempt to allay the fears of Gulf leaders concerning Iran's nuclear program, and to press those countries to reject US influence and cooperate more with Iran on various political and economic issues.  At a late October meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the  RPO DUBAI 00000016  002.2 OF 002   Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini proposed the formation of a regional security pact, saying that US Middle East policy is not in the interests of the region. "It is a US policy to create tensions in the region. Iran's response will be rational and wise," Hosseini said, adding that "active cooperation among the PGCC [Note: Iranians refer to the GCC as the "Persian" Gulf Cooperation Council. Endnote.] states will be the best way to reinforce security in the region." Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar reiterated the proposal in November, saying that Iran's policies are based on respect and good-neighborliness.  Frequent diplomatic visits to Gulf states by Iranian envoys, and a series of recent comments by senior Iranian officials promoting a regional security arrangement indicate a renewed effort toward Iran's goal of regional leadership.  Message Appears Not to Resonate -------------------------------  4.(C) Analysts and observers commented that Larijani's message garnered a lot of attention but appeared not to resonate with its intended audience.  The speech reportedly sparked a great deal of discussion later, with some conference attendees calling it "extraordinary," but nonetheless, it received only polite applause.  A journalist who attended the event told IRPOffs that Saudis and Emiratis later commented to him that they were not moved by the appeal, saying they felt closer to the Americans, who offer them technology and education, than to the Iranians, who offer them nothing.  A regional security analyst at a local think tank separately commented that Iran's message urging security cooperation is nothing new and has no resonance in the region, particularly with Iran's new government and in view of its interventionist policies regarding Iraq and Lebanon.  The analyst dismissed as ineffective Iran's tactic of asserting that nuclear restrictions on Iran will extend to the region, saying that Gulf states do not view the Iranian nuclear case as a valid test case for them, given their strong suspicions that Iran has the intention to build a nuclear weapon.  5.(C) Embassy DCM subsequently spoke to MFA Acting U/S Tariq Al Haidan for his reaction to Larijani's speech.  Al Haidan limited his remarks to saying that the Iranians are "talking a lot on this subject but that you (the US) shouldn't worry about it," implying that the UAE was not taking seriously Tehran's call to eject the US from its bases here.  6.(SBU) There has been scant media reaction to Larijani's speech in the local Arabic press, other than reprinting some of the Western reports.  Reporting on the Iraq Study Group's report is dominating the Arabic press.  Iranian press reported Larijani's speech with little commentary, although one outlet, Fars News, called Larijani's regional security proposal "audacious" and "the strongest sign yet of Iran's rising assertiveness in its contest with the United States for influence in the region."  7.(C) Comment: Iran's efforts to date to forge a new regional security arrangement and decrease US presence in the region appear have gotten little traction with GCC governments and are unlikely to do so in the future.  This does not mean, however, that countries in the region - particularly Gulf states - feel they can ignore or alienate their large Persian neighbor.  At the governmental level, Gulf allies like the UAE will likely try to continue their balancing act between maintaining restrained but economically beneficial ties to Iran, while preserving close links to the US.  The USG advances its interests by continuing to emphasize to Arab governments the benefits of alliance with the US, in contrast to the lack of benefits offered by Iran. Arab countries also need assurance that in the long-term, any future change to US-Iran relations will not come at their expense, either politically or economically.  In contrast, the view from the "street" is different from that of Arab governments.  President Ahmadinejad has gained some popularity on the regional "street" by manipulating and amplifying anti-American and anti-Israel sentiments.  While Iran may tap into regional discontent with US policies and culture, it has not offered a credible and attractive alternative in its place, a point we can continue to emphasize in our public statements.  This message was cleared by Embassy Abu Dhabi. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  IRPoffs met February 12 with an Iranian/US Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) who has business interests in Dubai. According to the single source, Rafsanjani recently purchased 2 billion USD worth of property near Dubai's Festival City, through his brother-in-law Marashi.  The contact noted that while international pressure on Iranian banks has limited formal trade and investment between the UAE and Iran, the "informal market" is booming.  He claimed one neighborhood in Dubai is "full of money exchangers" and that it is easy to find unregistered hawalas; a traditional network of brokers who transfer money outside of recognized banking channels.  The contact claimed that at least 50 percent if not up to 70 percent of the new Business Bay district in Dubai is owned by Iranians and that 30 percent of the rapidly expanding luxury housing and shopping projects in Dubai Marina are Iranian investments. Regarding reverse investment in Iran, an Iranian-born, Emirati banker claimed to IRPoffs February 11 that while the UAE government is not investing in Iran, private Emirati citizens are doing so, citing sugar and retail investments, as well as hospitals and real estate markets.  While none of these deals likely run afoul of current US and UN regulations, it would appear that the current international face-off with Iran has not stopped UAE investment there.  End Summary  Iranian investment in UAE --------------------------------  2.(S) IRPOoffs discussed Iranian investment in Dubai February 12 with an Iranian/US LPR businessman based in Dubai.  The contact has been a Consulate Dubai contact for several years.  Although he frequently travels to Iran, he openly calls for regime change in his meetings with US officials.  According to the single-source, Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani recently spent 2 billion USD on property near Festival City in Dubai, a new shopping and resort district under construction on the north side of  Dubai's creek.  The purchase was reportedly made through his sister's husband, Hossain Marashi.  According to the contact, Iranians own "at least 50 percent if not up to 70 percent" of  Business Bay -- a business, commercial and residential free zone under construction -- and 30 percent of the rapidly expanding luxury housing and shopping projects in Dubai Marina.  Conversely, a Tehran-based businessman claimed that investment in Dubai from Iran is waning in favor of Kazakhstan and Bulgaria.  3.(S) The Iranian/US LPR asserted that while formal trade and investment ties with Iran and the international community are under strain due to recent actions by the US and the UN, the "informal market" between the UAE and Iran is booming.  The contact claimed the Arbift building in the Deira area of Dubai houses a number of Iranian businesses and many "money exchanges."  Turning to hawalas, the businessman stated, "I could take you by the hand and bring you to a shop that sells automobile belts in Nasser Square." (Note: also known as Baniyas Square and is located in Deira at the junction of Baniyas and Maktoum Streets.  Endnote).  "Behind the shop front, there is a back room where yahoo instant messenger sends constant updates about money exchanges to be made."   The contact also noted that cash is often carried via suitcase into Dubai.  According to the single source, Dubai customs will simply prepare a receipt noting how much cash a person claims to be carrying carried in (Note.  Officially, any amounts above 10,000 USD must be claimed.  Endnote)  Although reputation-conscious financial institutions in Dubai may not accept large cash deposits hand carried into the country, he claimed "many" institutions and individuals will.  UAE investment in Iran -------------------------------  4.(S) In a meeting with an Iranian-born, Emirati banker February 11 IRPoffs were told that while the UAE government is not investing in Iran, private Emirati citizens are "quietly" doing so.   The banker said that the Al FuttQ family plans to build 50 stores of the French grocery chain Carrefour, for which they own the local franchise, throughout Iran - and that two are currently under way.  The Emirati banker also noted that an unspecified local sugar magnate (believed to be Jebel Ali-based Al Khaleej Sugar owned by Jamal Majed Al Ghurair) invests quite  RPO DUBAI 00000005  002.2 OF 002   heavily in Iran's sugar market.  Furthermore, said the source, Emiratis are investing in real estate and hospitals across Iran.  A separate source who works with a company linked to the Dubai government said the old local Iranian families are investing in Iran, also citing the Al Futtaim family.  This source also said there was investment from Ras al Khaimah into Iran.  He said his office was considering a development deal in Iran but doubted they would do it.  He was arguing against doing it, saying no one makes any money there.  5.(S) Comment.  It is difficult to obtain a true picture of Iranian investments in Dubai because of the informal nature of many of the investments and the anecdotal/poor quality of the data.  Additionally, if all rumors were to be believed regarding Rafsanjani's investments in Dubai, he would rival the ruler in the amount of property held.  The Banker's remarks about the UAEG not investing in Iran track with what we have heard about large Emirate level government investors, such as ADIA.  Up till now, we had heard rumors of UAE private sector investments in Iran but few details.  While these reverse investments may not run afoul of current US or UN sanctions, they are worth tracking.  We have previously raised concerns about the potential of UAE private sector investments tied to the Iranian hydrocarbon sector (i.e., Dana Gas see reftel) and warned about the potential for misuse of the UAE financial system by Iran. Although the UAE government might say that these particular private investment are out of their direct control, it might be useful to raise them as areas of concern as we develop more substantial information.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  According to a Dubai-based Iranian entrepreneur, private Iranian banks are not faring well.  In particular, he predicted that Saman Bank will soon be bankrupt.  The contact opined that the Iranian government has done more to damage cash flows in and out of Iran than recent actions taken by the US and the UN.  In his opinion,  US and UN actions only harm honest, legitimate business entities, as anyone wanting to move money and goods can do so via informal - and not always legal - networks.  The businessman claimed that he is one of a handful of local Iranians engaged in legitimate business and not simply operating in Dubai to circumvent sanctions.  He said in fact he no longer tries to conduct much business in Iran, because of the difficult operating climate.  Regarding Iranian presence in Iraq, he  claimed that some IRGC members there are actually retired and now in business.  They are among the few businessmen who can "stomach" the investment climate and security environment there.  End Summary.  Iranian banking ----------------  2.(S) In a February 13 conversation,  a local Iranian entrepreneur told IRPoff that private banks in Iran are not faring well.  He claimed that Saman Bank (owned by Khodro car manufacturers) is on the verge of bankruptcy because it overextended itself by opening letters of credit (LCs) valued at 2.5  times its actual collateral.  In general, stated the entrepreneur, private Iranian banks offer loans and extend LCs on much more relaxed terms than state-owned banks.  Despite the fact that private banks charge higher rates than the government imposed rates used by state banks, "easier" terms and a focus on customer service have attracted customers away from state banks.   3.(S) When asked if recent US and UN actions against Iran have impacted the price of LCs, the businessman said "one week after you took action, the Central Bank stopped all LCs in Iran." (Note: it was not clear if he was referring to  US Treasury action or UNSC resolution 1737. Endnote)  He continued, "I don't know why they did that.  Their restrictions have done more to harm business than anything the international community could have done."  Reportedly, LCs are being opened again in Iran - albeit on a much slower basis.  The contact said a committee at the Central Bank has to review every request for an LC.  If opening a letter of credit from Dubai, the businessman said it is much better to use Standard Chartered than Dubai-based Iranian banks - as the rates are better at Standard Chartered. He said he had used HSBC in the past as well, but HSBC cut all of its business ties with Iran.  Impact of US and UNSC actions -----------------------------  4.(S) The contact noted that in recent years "many" Iranians moved to Dubai and set up local companies with the express purpose of circumventing US sanctions.  The entrepreneur claimed that he is one of a handful of Iranians based in Dubai with an almost wholly UAE market.  He said if necessary, he could cut off all ties with Iran and remain in business.  He  claimed that US Treasury actions and UNSCR 1737 only serve to hurt legitimate business entities - like himself - who use formal, legal means to transfer goods and money.  He said that individuals who want to get around the sanctions are able to do so through informal channels. Because of the extensive network between Dubai and Iran, the contact claimed that informal systems to move goods and money are quite deep-rooted.  He claimed that one method to illegally move money from Iran to Dubai is to open an LC in Dubai and have the money transferred from Iran - absent any actual shipment of goods.  The contact said all that is needed is a falsified bill of lading and certificate of origin. (Note: similar information reported in reftel by separate source. Endnote)  IRGC in Iraq ----------------  5.(S) The contact noted that Iran has historic ties to many countries in the region, and Iraq is no different.  The  RPO DUBAI 00000006  002.2 OF 002   businessman claimed that some of what appears to be IRGC presence there may be in fact former IRGC members now engaged in business activities.  The contact noted that former IRGC members are much more comfortable doing business in Iraq than the average individual.  They are used to hostile environments, he said.  It is possible they pass on information to the Iranian government, he said, just like a former US official working in the private sector abroad may continue to share information with the US government.  (Note: The contact claimed ongoing friendships with former IRGC members from his time of mandatory military service, although he did not indicate whether he had done his service in that branch. Endnote)  6.(S) Comment:  The contact indicated his motivation for speaking with IRPoff was a personal desire to promote positive US-Iran relations.  Although critical of the Iranian government, he caveated all of his comments by noting that he sees himself as a mediator - trying to tell both sides the truth.  He offered to arrange a meeting for IRPO with the new Iranian Ambassador to the UAE, former Foreign Ministry spokesman Asefi, which we respectfully declined.  He commented that he was surprised by the appointment of someone as senior as Asefi to the UAE and mused whether it was a reaction to IRPO's presence here.  He claimed that Asefi was relatively open-minded.   In addition, the businessman clearly  wanted to persuade the US that the current sanctions regime on Iran more negatively impacted legitimate businesses operating through formal, legal channels, not  the Iranian government and illegal trade.  Whether these were self-serving or genuine comments is not known. End Comment. BURNS

Bet Kolia will lead a delegation of Iranian Assyrians to an Assyrian National Congress meeting March 24-25 in California. According to Bet Kolia, there have been no recent changes in the status of the Assyrian community in Iran, but he said the situation for Assyrians in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan is very poor.  The MP indicated that during his upcoming planned visit to the US, he would likely meet with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo of the 14th district in California, who is of Assyrian descent.  He added that when he spoke with some officials from the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Ettela'at) about the possibility of parliamentary exchanges between Iran and the US, they were receptive and encouraging.  End Summary.  2. (S//NF) IRPOffs met February 22 with the Assyrian representative (MP) in the Iranian Majles, Yonathan Bet Kolia. (Note: Five seats in the Iranian Majles are designated specifically for religious minorities.  There is one representative each from the Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Assyrian communities, and two from the Armenian community. End Note.) The Assyrian MP was in Dubai to apply for a US visa in order to attend a meeting of the Assyrian National Congress, an organization that brings together representatives from Assyrian communities across the world.  He has attended similar meetings in the US in the past.  The meeting will be held in Ceres, California on March 24-25.  Traveling with Mr. Bet Kolia will be nine other members of the Assyrian community in Iran, representing various Assyrian organizations inside the country. The MP spoke about the current status of the Assyrian community in Iran, and also commented on status of Assyrians in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan.  Assyrians in Iran -----------------  3. (S//NF)  Prior to the Iranian revolution there were 70,000-80,000 Assyrians in Iran, the MP said.  (Note:  Assyrians in Iran refer to their language as Assyrian, and describe themselves as Assyrian, rather than Chaldean, Syriac, or other similar names that have been used to describe this ancient Christian community.  This Iranian delegation to the Assyrian National Congress plans to promote the singular use of the term "Assyrian" to describe the members of this community worldwide. End Note.)  During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, many Assyrians fled the country, particularly families with sons who were eligible for conscription.  Families sent their sons to the West to avoid frontline military service, and then joined them as soon as they could.  Currently, there are no more than 30,000 Assyrians in Iran, the MP estimated.  Before the Khatami presidency, religious minorities did not receive government funding on a regular basis.  Employers regularly discriminated against non-Muslims, calling for "Muslims only" in job advertisements, despite the constitution providing for equal employment rights to all recognized religious minorities. (Note: According to the Iranian constitution, Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities.  End Note.)  When discrimination in the employment sector was brought to Khatami's attention the practice stopped, the MP said. Furthermore, a budget for religious minorities (providing funding for schools, cultural centers, sports etc.) was made into a necessary line-item in the government budget, and it would require an additional law to remove it.  Religious minorities (as a group, not individually) have received approximately $2 million annually from the government since the Khatami years, according to the MP.  4. (S//NF) The Khatami presidency saw many improvements for recognized religious minorities in Iran, and Ahmadinejad has kept the same policies in place, the Assyrian MP noted. However, the Majles is attempting to decrease the budget for religious minorities for the upcoming year.  The budget bill is still under discussion in the Majles, so the outcome is not yet clear. (Note: The Iranian year 1386 begins March 21, 2007. End Note.) The MP inferred that the attempted decrease in the budget is a result of Iran's overall economic woes, rather than an action targeted against religious minorities.  Mr. Bet Kolia is attempting to have the budget for the Assyrian community  RPO DUBAI 00000007  002.2 OF 002   separated from the overall budget for religious minorities in the upcoming year.  The Assyrian community has separate schools but opens them to children of all religions.  They are permitted to teach classes in the Assyrian language, and also write their own textbooks, which the government then prints for them.  The government pays the salaries of the teachers, but the teachers are Assyrian.  The situation for Assyrians inside Iran is fairly good, particularly in comparison with the status of Assyrian community in nearby countries, the MP commented.  Assyrians in Iraq -----------------  5. (S//NF)  The Iranian Assyrian MP estimated that 250,000 Assyrians have fled Iraq since the beginning of the war in 2003, also estimating a high number (NFI) of internally displaced persons among Assyrians in Iraq. The MP related one egregious case of a young Assyrian woman who was kidnapped for ransom. He claimed she was beheaded when the family was unable to pay the ransom and her boiled head returned to the family.  He described the current situation for Assyrians in Iraq as very poor.  The MP claimed there is a movement to promote the creation of an Assyrian homeland, to be located most likely in Nineveh province in Iraq, and hinted at desire for third country support.  The MP inferred it is not a separatist movement but one that seeks the creation of an autonomous region within the larger country.  He stressed that under no circumstances could the Assyrian homeland be under the control of the Kurds.  The Assyrians, he said, hold the Kurds responsible for a reported massacre of Assyrians in Iraq in 1933.   He also mentioned the assassination decades ago of the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church, although it was unclear whether he was insinuating Kurdish involvement in that assassination.  Assyrians in Jordan and Syria -----------------------------  6. (S//NF) The MP stated that there are an estimated 120,000 Assyrian refugees from Iraq in Jordan.  He claimed Assyrian refugees in Jordan face extreme poverty, and a number of women and children are forced into prostitution in order to feed their families.  The Assyrian community in Syria, which the MP estimated at 60,000, faces government restrictions on their freedom to congregate.  When the MP approached Assyrian organizations in Syria to suggest that the larger Assyrian community hold a conference in Syria, they said it wasn't possible.  When he offered to go to the Syrian Embassy in Iran to request permission, they pleaded with him not to do so.  The MP also gave an estimate of the Assyrian community in Turkey as approximately 40,000.  He also said that SARG claims after the film "Passion of the Christ" that it would help support promotion of the Assyrian language came to nothing.  Parliamentary Exchanges? ------------------------  7. (S//NF)  The Assyrian Majles representative indicated that during his upcoming planned visit to the US, he would likely meet with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, from California's 14th congressional district, who is of Assyrian descent.  (Note: This is likely not their first meeting. End Note.)  The MP talked about that meeting in a strictly Assyrian context, but also discussed the broader idea of contact between members of the Iranian and US legislatures.  The MP said that he spoke with officials from the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Ettela'at) prior to leaving the country to apply for a US visa, and mentioned the possibility of parliamentary exchanges between Iran and US.  The officials were receptive to the idea, he said, and encouraged him to pursue it.  8. (S//NF) Comment: MP Bet Kolia underscored that the situation for Assyrians in Iran is largely unchanged and superior to that in Iraq or Syria, where old communities exist, and in Jordan, among the Iraqi refugee community.   While his view may be tempered by his official status, we have not seen any reports that suggest a deterioration of Assyrians' status in Iran. IRPOff broached with him the idea of meeting DRL officials while in the US; he took contact information but made no commitments. BURNS

RPO DUBAI 00000009  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian L. Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  A well-connected Iranian professor criticized the Ahmadinejad's government for gross mismanagement and claimed that large portions of the population had turned against him.  A clear Rafsanjani supporter, he claimed the Expediency Council is the one person in Iranian politics who can act as a counterweight to the Supreme Leader.  The contact appeared to have a good understanding of Western perspectives of Iran, based on his years studying in the US and the UK.  His insights into Rafsanjani are useful, and his claims of Rafsanjani activism are shared by others.  His assessment of Rafsanjani as the sole counterweight to the Supreme Leader, however, seems exaggerated.  End summary  2.(S/NF) An engineering professor from Sharif University shared February 26 his assessment of the current situation in Iran. Although clearly pro-Rafsanjani, he was not particularly politically active, although he came from a prominent family. His views seemed to have been shaped by three important factors.  He is reportedly related by marriage to Rafsanjani and has met him on a number of occasions.  He is from a reportedly prominent bazaari family, although he says he clashes with his father's traditionalist views.  And his years spent studying in the US and UK appeared have allowed him to understand the Western perspective on Iran and given him some fairly pro-Western views.  (For instance, he said his non-objection to his daughter studying abroad is relatively rare in Iran.)  He repeatedly made clear his views were his own and that he did not have first-hand access to information, although he mentioned he and his family go to Rafsanjani's house once a year or every other year to pay respects.  He also claimed that his father is one of chief informal advisors to the regime on commercial matters and as such serves as the principal liaison between the bazaaris and the government.  (Note: this assertion has not been independently confirmed. Endnote)  His father was reportedly imprisoned and tortured by the Shah, accused of funding Islamists against the government, and held several years in Evin prison.  He later held a high level position at the Ministry of Ershad when Khatami was minister.  Ahmadinejad: a bad manager --------------------------  3.(S/NF) The professor said his traditionalist father supports President Ahmadinejad because he thinks he is honest, but the son disagrees and is very critical of the president's performance.  In the professor's view, the Iranian government's worst enemy is its bad management.  Anyone qualified has left public service or been fired.  He also claimed most bazaaris have turned against Ahmadinejad because of his economic mismanagement of the country, a view echoed by other contacts. Another contact claimed that the bazaaris are actively trying to undermine Ahmadinejad by creating artificial shortages of goods to increase pressure on the government.  A different contact claimed Rafsanjani is directing such meddling.  4.(S/NF) After a year and a half in office, Ahmadinejad has also alienated wider swaths of the population by not keeping his economic promises, the professor said.  In a separate conversation, an Iranian economist said that that the roughly 30 percent of the population who either a) directly benefited from oil dollars in the past; or b) were staunch conservatives in support of Ahmadinejad are turning against him as their pockets become lighter.  Another contact commented that Ahmadinejad's weakness is that his major economic priority from the beginning was redistribution of wealth, not economic development, but in any case has failed in his efforts.  Private sector complaints -------------------------  5.(S/NF) The professor, who also owns a publishing company, said he has had to lay off 20 employees since the economy started plummeting.  Other business contacts have also said they've been forced to lay off large numbers of employees.  The professor echoed others' comments that they are unsure how to make decisions regarding their privately owned businesses in light of undefined possible sanctions coming down the pike.  Lessons learned?  RPO DUBAI 00000009  002.2 OF 003   ----------------  6.(S/NF) In a view shared by many of our contacts, the professor believes Ahmadinejad's win resulted from two factors: 1) an order from the Supreme Leader to the head of IRGC to use IRGC and Basij to mobilize votes for him; and 2) votes from uneducated people who believed his promises of economic support.  One source claimed that the Supreme Leader thought that Ahmadinejad would be a humble, pliable man of the people and was surprised by his antagonistic posturing.  He heard that in the December 2006 elections, the Supreme Leader instructed IRGC not to work against Rafsanjani.  He is also hearing that large portions of the IRGC and Basij no longer support Ahmadinejad, a view shared by some other contacts.  The professor said the silver lining may be that this election will act as a maturing experience for the Iranian electorate, who will learn from the "worst mistake they have ever made."  Rafsanjani moves to counter the president -----------------------------------------  7.(S/NF) The professor said he thought one of Rafsanjani's most significant recent statements was his speech for anniversary of the revolution, in which he claimed to have advised Ayatollah Khomeini that then President Bani-Sadr was not the right person for the job, prior to Bani-Sadr's ouster.  The professor said this comment was believed to have been a veiled threat that he could do the same with Ahmadinejad.  8.(S/NF) The professor claimed that Rafsanjani has a good relationship with the grand ayatollahs and has persuaded them not to meet Ahmadinejad.  He claimed the grand ayatollahs are generally suspicious that Ahmadinejad is dragging the country into conflict and specifically peeved that the president took it upon himself to write a letter to the Pope.  Another source also mentioned that the grand ayatollahs are shunning the president, but for the more selfish reason in that they believe he is jeopardizing their interests.  His view of Rafsanjani ----------------------  9.(S/NF) The professor asserted that Rafsanjani genuinely cares about Iran, wants a better relationship with West, and can make it happen.  He called him the only counterweight to the Supreme Leader in Iranian politics.  Without indicating how many times he has met Rafsanjani, he indicated at least several occasions of family gatherings.  He described the Expediency Chair as honest in his politics, though he quickly qualified that perhaps he is less honest in other ways, alluding to the rampant rumors of corruption.  He said Rafsanjani is very intelligent, with an IQ of 170.  He also said he has the knack of remembering details about people.  The first time he met him, he said, they discussed the Internet.  When they met again years later, Rafsanjani recalled the conversation.  10.(S/NF) The professor said Rafsanjani made a lot of mistakes as president, although he claimed he was the only person who would give the Supreme Leader realistic assessments of the situation during the Iran-Iraq war.  The professor felt that then President Khatami and the reformers made a mistake by humiliating Rafsanjani instead of bringing him onboard to help them fight their battles.  He said Rafsanjani's two electoral humiliations sent him into a state of depression but that his landslide win in December had reenergized him.  When asked about the rumor that the Supreme Leader may be replaced by a council, he didn't answer, simply saying Rafsanjani has the ability to energize any institution with which he is associated.  Differing views of Supreme Leader's current take on Ahmadinejad --------------------------------------------- ------------------  11.(S/NF) The professor believes that unlike Rafsanjani, the Supreme Leader changes his opinion frequently, according to whoever gets his ear.  The professor believes the Supreme Leader dropped support for Ahmadinejad briefly in the time around the December election but has given him back his support in the past few weeks.  He argued that although the leader knows he made a mistake by bringing Ahmadinejad in, cutting him loose will undermine the leader's authority.  On the other hand, a Tehran-based businessman disputed this assessment and said he did not think Ahmadinejad had returned to the leader's good graces, citing his absence at several recent meetings the leader  RPO DUBAI 00000009  003.2 OF 003   had with cabinet members.  US-Iran relations -----------------  12.(S/NF) Regarding relations with the US, the professor understood the US need to forcefully counteract Iranian aggression in Iraq, but he thought it was necessary to find a way for the two countries to talk.  He was very worried that the countries were drifting into war, predicting disastrous results.  He said there was little understanding of the US position on the nuclear issue inside Iran because of the spin the regime puts on the news.  Specifically, he said there was little knowledge of what P5-1 is offering Iran, little understanding of the US position on civilian energy, and little recognition of the symbolic importance of the offer that Secretary Rice would conduct the negotiations herself.  13.(S/NF) He maintained that the US now sees itself as a father figure in the world, and it should therefore deal with Iran as an errant son, assuring him that acceptance back in the fold is possible, rather than like someone who will always be an outsider.  He said acts of "kindness" go a long way and applauded efforts such as the recent travel to Iran by the US wresting team.  He believed that President Bush should offer a meeting with no preconditions, but only with the Supreme Leader or Rafsanjani.  There would be enormous pressure from Iran to accept.  The leader would likely refuse, but Rafsanjani would find a way to do it.  14.(S/NF) Comment:  While his statements to a US official may have been colored by the fact that his son was applying for a US student visa the next day, he repeatedly stressed that these are simply his views and what he is hearing others say, and didn't claim any firsthand access to knowledge.  Both he and the Iranian-American who introduced him to IRPO Director are clear supporters of Rafsanjani, who they pitch as the key to solving the Iranian problem.  Given our limited access to the Iranian population, it is difficult to assess the general sentiment on Rafsanjani at this time, although Rafsanjani's December election results would seem to indicate significant popularity in Tehran.  Several contacts claim that Rafsanjani is actively working to isolate Ahmadinejad and influence decision-making, in cooperation with Khatami.  On the other hand, calling Rafsanjani the only counterweight to the Supreme Leader seems to run counter to the predominant view of Iranian politics as dominated by multiple spheres of influence.

Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary.  A dual national who in most ways represents the most pro-Western, secular segment of the Iranian population, gave IRPOffs a critical assessment of US strategy on Iran's nuclear program.  He maintained that US arguments against an Iranian enrichment program have not swayed even the elite of Iranian society.  All of Iran, including secularists who dislike the government like him, took two lessons from the Iran-Iraq war, he said.  One, Iran has to be self-reliant in all things. Two, in the one area of WMD, he said, the mullahs have a better track record than the US.  He cited a widely-held view in Iran that the US, along with France and Germany, helped Iraq carry out chemical attacks against Iran during their eight-year war. He said memories from the war are still fresh in Iranians' minds.  He advised the US to proactively engage Iranian elite on the subject and to take the initiative in trying to restore the trust deficit between the two countries.  His recommendation was to find a way to talk to the regime now, rather than risk having to revise US positions later by new facts on the ground.  His comments are particularly noteworthy, given his very pro-Western stance on most other issues, and seemed to epitomize the Iranian nationalist viewpoint about which we hear so much.  End Summary.  Trust deficit ----------------  2.(S/NF) Speaking to IRPoffs February 25, an Iranian-American reformist bemoaned what he perceives as a "trust deficit" between Iran and the US.  The contact, who comes from the most pro-Western, reform-minded segment in Iran, has a good understanding of both Iranian and US perspectives.  In his view, the recent escalation of tensions could have been mitigated had USG officials acknowledged the trust deficit early on and appealed to the elite of Iran.  He did not understand the rationale for not publicizing the contents of the P5-1 package from the outset, saying that doing so could have given fodder to those people advocating talks.  The contents of the package are still not understood in Iran, he said.  A publicized offer by the US to "compensate" Iran in some concrete way while it suspends enrichment could help build trust, he added.  Lessons learned -------------------  3.(S/NF) A portion of the trust deficit, this reformist told us, stems from lessons taken from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.  All Iranians now believe that -- regardless of the fact that such an approach would not be economically rational -- the country should be self-sufficient in all things.  Because of this, US arguments that Iran does not "need" civilian nuclear energy because of its oil and gas reserves are not persuasive and are possibly counter-productive, in his view.  Furthermore, he agreed with what he termed the widespread view in Iran that it is not up to the international community to determine domestic energy policy or energy needs of other countries, and that under international law, Iran has the "right" to pursue nuclear energy.  4.(S/NF) This pro-Western reformer was also dismissive of the argument that the US has advanced to demonstrate that Iran's intentions must be to build nuclear weapons, that the design of Iran's nuclear program does not make economic sense for a purely civilian program.  His reasoning was that outsiders should not assume the worst when looking at the Iranian government's development plans, given all the illogical decision-making apparent in other state-run projects.  He inferred that the Iranian government rarely spends its money efficiently. (Another contact, an economist, recently made the same argument, claiming that Iran had wasted more money in its failed attempt several years ago to become independent in sugar production than it has spent to date on its nuclear industry.)  5.(S/NF) Furthermore, this reformer said, the trust deficit is compounded by Iranian views of US culpability in Iraqi chemical attacks against Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war.  He said in this area (and apparently in this one only) he thinks "the mullahs" have a better track record than the US.  He noted it is "common knowledge" in Iran that the US provided the Iraqi military not only with weapons, but also with satellite imagery depicting "best" targeting opportunities, information the Iraqis then used in their chemical attacks.  He also noted French and  RPO DUBAI 00000010  002.2 OF 002   German responsibility for supplying components for chemical weapons.  It is also widely remembered, he said, that the USG initially accused Iranian forces of what were eventually proven to be Iraqi chemical attacks against the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja.  This reformer claimed that even had Iranian forces had access to chemical weapons, they would not have used them.  He also claimed Iran took greater care in general at avoiding civilian targets than the Iraqis.  6.(S/NF) Echoing Israeli commentary about Ahmadi-Nejad's Iran, the reformer added that there are some in Iran, and apparently not just those in the regime, who view the US as "an existential threat."  He repeated an assertion we here regularly from Iranian interlocutors - that the US would drop all objections to Iran's nuclear program if only it were to shake hands with Israel.  7.(S/NF) The dual national - no fan of Ahmadi-Nejad -- also credited the latter with winning US "acceptance of a civilian nuclear energy program in Iran," and predicted Ahmadinejad would continue to push back on US red-lines on the nuclear issue.  NGO concerns ------------------  7.(S/NF) The dual national was also critical of State Department's classified DRL and MEPI grants for Iran, saying his own work with foreign NGOs had suffered from the increased IRI suspicion these grants had provoked.  He noted that he now had to hide affiliations with outside NGOs, even on non-political projects, to avoid raising government suspicions.  The reformer was also concerned that like other Iranians, he could face future repercussions in Iran for work he did with US NGOs predating the introduction of these new grants.  He said that while he is not allowing his concerns to stop his work on NGO-related projects, he is taking many more extra precautions.  8.(S/NF) Comment:  Some of our interlocutor's arguments are specious or naove -- e.g.,  that the US should not assume Iran's nuclear program has a military component just because it is not designed in a cost-effective way for civilian uses.  Coming as it does from one of the most pro-Western Iranian of our contacts --  that we have failed to sway the elite -- is notable, and we should bear this in mind as we contemplate future public statements.   Judging from the passion with which he presented them, his statements seemed to go to the core views of Iranian nationalism.  At the same time, he is very pro-American -- albeit critical of some aspects of US policy.  9.(S/NF) Comment con't:  We were struck by this contract's degree of high anxiety and agitation on the question of US-Iran relations.  This pro-Western interlocutor's main theme was that the US comes to the Iran equation with a lot of past baggage and Iranians universally (even the Western-oriented) feel they have genuine reasons to question US motives.  Therefore, he argued, the US should focus publicly on the win-win potential of negotiations, underscoring the benefits for average Iranians should solutions be found to the litany of bilateral and international issues that must ultimately be addressed. While we pushed back strongly at the notion that Ahmadi-Nejad had won any concessions from the US (e.g., recognition of Iran's civil nuclear "rights"), our interlocutor appeared to be arguing that the US should decide now what a realistic end scenario is for a mutually acceptable Iranian nuclear program - and be ready to communicate that.  By doing so, he argued, the US will deny regime hardliners the ability to achieve new "facts on the ground" in the nuclear program.  At the same time, those desirous of negotiations could win public support - and put pressure on the regime - for the P5+1 package and the future it holds out to Tehran. BURNS 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000011  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/15/2017 TAGS: ECON, ECIN, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: PRIVITIZATION DEBATE SHARPENS FACTIONAL RIVALRY   RPO DUBAI 00000011  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has been a notional objective of the Iranian government since it implemented its first 5-year economic plan in 1989.  Two significant barriers to privatization have been the strict interpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution by the Iranian government, and private sector anxiety about uncertain outcomes of privatization.  In July 2006, the Supreme Leader issued a decree redefining Article 44 and thereby opening up most government industries to privatization.  Despite the decree, little concrete action to advance privatization efforts followed.  In a speech to state officials on February 19, Ayatollah Khamenei criticized the lack of progress on the privatization front and, according to one economist, openly contradicted key aspects of the president's position on privatization.  Several contacts predict that IRGC controlled-companies will take over the privatized companies and "real" economic growth will only result from creation of new private enterprises.  End Summary.  Privatization efforts 1989-2006 --------------------------------------  2.(C) Privatization has been an agenda item for the Iranian government since its first post-revolutionary economic development plan in 1989.  However, progress has been negligible.  An Iranian economist, speaking to IRPoff, attributed the lack of privatization initiatives to two factors.  Firstly, a strict interpretation up until 2006 of Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution limited the private sector role in the economy and called for government control of major industries. (Note:  Article 44 divides the Iranian economy into three sectors - state, cooperative, and private - and it outlines the size and role of each sector.  Endnote)  Secondly, there has been no push from the private sector because of overall pessimism that privatization would be conducted in a fair, transparent manner.  This pessimism, according to the economist, is compounded by the private sector's inability to help shape government policies.  The Supreme Leader's decree ------------------------------------  3.(C) On July 2, 2006, the Supreme Leader issued an executive order which in effect reinterpreted Article 44 of the Constitution and opened up "most" government sectors to privatization.  The economist suggested that the Supreme Leader stepped up privatization efforts to stimulate the creation of sorely needed employment opportunities and to combat criticism that the Islamic Republic is unable to adapt and change. Efforts are allegedly underway to make the Chamber of Commerce more independent in order to directly address the private sector's  lack of political representation.  The economist also said that political entities affiliated with the business community are on the rise, as well as newspapers devoted to private sector interests, such as Sarmayeh and Etemad. (Comment: To date, IRPoff has seen no evidence of formalized private sector lobbying groups taking root.  Much of the private sector's political activity appears to take place informally. End comment).  4.(C) The Supreme Leader's executive order interpreting Article 44 stipulates that up to 80 percent of the shares of "most" government companies are to be privatized, via the Tehran Stock Exchange.  By March 2010, the government must withdraw fully from all sectors where the private sector is active, unless it receives permission from the parliament.  Private sector participation will be allowed in international trade activities, unless a government monopoly exists.  The companies that are up for 80 percent privatization include: -- all government banks except for the following:  the Central Bank, Bank Melli, Bank of Industry and Mines, the Agriculture Bank, Bank Maskan, Bank Sepah and the Export Development Bank (Note.  Five known banks appear to be up for privatization: Bank Mellat, Post Bank of Iran, Bank Refah, Bank Saderat Iran and Tejarat Bank.  Endnote) -- all insurance companies except for Iranian Central Insurance -- all power provision companies except for the main power transfer networks -- all post and telecommunications companies with the exception of the parent telecommunication network, transfer of frequencies and exchange and distribution of basic mail services. -- all government aviation and shipping organizations, except for the Civil Aviation Organization and the Ports and Shipping  RPO DUBAI 00000011  002.2 OF 002   Organization -- all downstream oil and gas companies -- all other government companies, except for companies where the government has a monopoly (such as the Iran Tobacco Corporation) and companies that have regulatory functions (such as Data Services of Iran).  Recent privatization efforts -------------------------------  5.(C) In an address to public officials February 19, Ayatollah Khamenei indicated that necessary steps to privatize much of Iran's economy have not taken place at a satisfactory pace. Khamenei reportedly attributed the delay to a divergence in government opinions but made it clear that all policymaking should be in line with his July 2006 decree.  The economist viewed the fact that Khamenei's speech came two days prior to elections for the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Mines (ICCIM) as an indication that many of "the top leadership is ready for a new era of interaction with the private sector." Reportedly for the first time, reformists claimed the majority of seats in the ICCIM in the February elections.  (Note: The ICCIM has 40 private sector representatives and 20 government representatives.  Endnote.)  6.(C) The economist noted that the government divergence of opinion referred to by Khamenei is a clash between two distinct groups:  1) those who believe in a 'Chinese style' economic opening which would unleash new economic momentum through private sector investments; and 2) those who want to control all economic activity by passing on economic interests to trusted circles rather than to the real private sector.  He claimed Khamenei and Rafsanjani fall into the first camp, but Ahmadinejad and his supporters - who constitutionally control domestic economic policy - fall into the latter group.  The analyst underscored that Ahmadinejad's priority coming into office was redistribution of wealth, not creation of new economic growth.  He claimed that Khamenei sent a shot across the bow of the president's camp with his statement February 19 that private sector investors are entitled to suitable profits. This runs contrary to Ahmadinejad's reportedly populous approach.  The President, noted one businessman, favors redistribution of 40 percent of private companies to the lower class (known as justice shares) and turning over 40 percent to IRGC cronies.  7.(C) Several business contacts have noted that they "expect" that "privatization" will actually be an opaque process in which state-run companies will be handed over to former IRGC members. The only "real" area for growth, noted one expert, is organic growth of small-to-mid-size entities.  Contacts typically note that although setting up a business can be a cumbersome process in Iran, individuals can make a comfortable living as long as their business does not grow "too much."  Presumably, because growth beyond a certain level turns businesses into prey for rapacious public officials.  8.(C) Comment.  The move toward privatization and a market driven economy could represent a significant change in Iranian economic policy, if properly enacted.  However, if as suspected, sectors of the economy that are "privatized" are only transferred from direct government control to the control of government-affiliated entities, little positive economic impact is expected.  It's safe to assume that we will see growth in semi-private institutions.   Consequently, it is likely that in the short-tem the government's efforts will result in privatization in name but not substance.  At this key juncture, if we conclude that privatization of Iran's major industries and services will create a more open, stable, economy and that such a development could help advance US interests, we should explore means of influencing this internal debate in this direction. Public Diplomacy and civil society programming through MEPI and DRL are possible vehicles. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) A purported former IRGC general and an Iranian doctor who is reportedly very close to the regime and specifically to the Basij, discussed in separate meetings with IRPO Director the IRGC, the Basij, and Ansar-e Hizballah.  One said recent US actions against Iranians in Iraq had increased IRGC antagonism, but predicted it was unlikely the group would retaliate. Another claimed that the percentage of hardcore conservatives in the IRGC is miniscule, and some are actually pro-American.  A third source, a psychologist,  reportedly teaches anger management to the Basij to help moderate their confrontational approach to the public.  While their assertions cannot be verified, their comments are noteworthy.  These contacts' comments on the current political situation will be reported septel.  End summary  IRGC ----  2.(S/NF) An Iranian who is purportedly a former IRGC general told IRPO Director that recent US actions against Iranians in Baghdad and Irbil had "provoked" the IRGC.  Although it was not clear if he was speaking based on assumption or real knowledge, he said the actions have heightened antagonism within the organization against the US.  On the other hand, the IRGC had long known that the US could take such actions, so they weren't necessarily surprised.  He doubted the US would get any useful information from detainees.  He also doubted there would be retaliation.  He claimed the Supreme Leader had ordered rhetoric about the events to be kept low-key.  3.(S/NF) The former general also said that one of his tasks in the personnel division of the IRGC during the Iran-Iraq war was finding replacements for military personnel killed in action. Through their personnel files, he claimed to have gained a great understanding of IRGC personnel.  He mentioned that in creating the IRGC personnel database, they based their system on the system used by the US military.  4.(S/NF) An Iranian doctor who spent years living in the US and who is now reportedly very close to former Foreign Minister Velayati and a number of other regime officials,  discussed his view of the IRGC.  He maintained that the IRGC has turned against President Ahmadi-Nejad.  He also mentioned that the IRGC-Quds Force reports directly to the Supreme Leader.  Asked his reaction to the US view that the IRGC was a very anti-US, hardline group that supported terrorism, he claimed that only a small percentage, around 3% of IRGC, are as hardline as the paramilitary group, Ansar-e Hizballah.  He said a few are members of both organizations.  Some in the IRGC are pro-US, he claimed.  He said that after the Iran-Iraq war, many IRGC officers went to university and got higher degrees, changing their world views.  He named as an example Soleimani (Note: presumably Brigadier General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the IRGC Qods Force.  Soleimani's classified biography says he did not attend college prior to the Iran-Iraq war and makes no mention of any university education post-war.  Endnote).  5.(S/NF) The former general mentioned that another former IRGC official who now has an Internet ISP company in Iran has been arrested several times for his company's activities.  The source disputed the notion that all IRGC officials and former officials are well connected with regime and favored by it.  He said this is only the case for members of a faction within the IRGC close to the current government (reftel).  Basij -----  6.(S/NF) Both the general and the doctor reportedly have links to the Basij.  The general reportedly knows Basij commander Mohammad Haj Aghamir, and the doctor is reportedly a regular advisor to and a friend of the leader of Tehran Basij.  The general estimated Basij membership at 10-13 million (Note: presumably including non-active duty.  End note).  The doctor said 10 million members, plus their families.  The doctor said Basij doctrine is to support the Supreme Leader and his policies.  The group has no separate agenda and is not seeking to gain power for itself.  He claimed that the Supreme Leader used the Basij to make known his dissatisfaction with the  RPO DUBAI 00000012  002.2 OF 002   president (NFI) and that the Basij stopped supporting Ahmadi-Nejad about six months ago.  He claimed the Basij now "hate" Ahmadi-Nejad because the president did not deliver on his promises to them during the election.  The president supposedly promised them a lot of positions in new government but was unable to deliver because he got inundated with similar requests for other groups.  7.(S/NF) The doctor's wife, who was also at the meeting, reportedly teaches anger management to members of the Basij as well as police and guards for the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani.  She has a doctorate in psychology.  Asked what the goal of such training is, she said as an example encouraging Basij to be less aggressive in their dealings with the public, such as confronting improperly dressed women.  She classified the Iranian culture as "angry," in that when Iranians are confronted, their normal response is anger, and said in this way Iranians differ from Americans.  She said she instructs the guards on alternative reactions.  Ansar-e Hizballah -----------------  8.(S/NF) The purported former IRGC general said the Ansar-e Hizballah paramilitary group was very conservative, but also very small.  He put their membership at 3000 members, found only at universities.  He said that Ansar-e Hizballah was established during the Iran-Iraq war by Hussein Allah Karam, who came out of the Basij.  He described Allah Karam as very smart, saying he has a PhD.  The general disputed rumors heard frequently from Iranians that Ansar-e Hizballah deploys foreigners such as Palestinians and Yemenis in their ranks.  9.(S/NF) The doctor said that Ansar-e Hizballah is divided into those willing to use violence and those not.  He also said the group is very conservative, calling them "stupid eggheads."  He put their membership, however, at 200,000 members.  He said the group supports President Ahmadi-Nejad, although they obeyed when the Supreme Leader reportedly told Allah Karam not to interfere in the December 2006 municipal and Assembly of Experts elections.  10.(S/NF) Comment:  These are snippets of interesting information offered by sources who reportedly have a degree of inside information.  These sources were all introduced to IRPO director by the same longstanding Iranian-American contact, making it difficult to independently verify their claims of access to the regime.  None of them were applying for visas, so they had no reason to color their statements in this regard - unlike many of our contacts - but their motivation for meeting with a US official remains unclear.  Their assessment that the IRGC contains various political groupings is in line with comments from other contacts, who have maintained the IRGC contains factions favoring one politician - Ahmadi-Nejad, Qalibaf, Rafsanjani, etc, - over another.  The doctor's claim that the IRGC as a whole is now anti-Ahmadi-Nejad and that the Basij "hate" him may have been based on political motivation. The doctor, who reportedly served on the presidential campaign of Velayati, remains an avid supporter, and claims Velayati is planning a 2009 bid.  He may have been deliberating exaggerating the situation to color USG's assessment of Ahmadi-Nejad's political standing in Iran.  11.(C) Comment con't:  On a related note, a different, very westernized Iranian contact who lives outside Iran - not apparently connected to any of these groups - advised the USG to moderate the "vilification" of the IRGC and the Basij, which he said was found in VOA broadcasting.  Given the size of these two organizations, he said, a large percentage of the Iranian population has an IRGC or Basij member in the family.  Making sweeping generalities about these organizations has the potential of turning this extended group against the US, he said, by making them worry that in the case of change in Iran, their family members would be targeted.  He implied that the focus of US criticisms should be on specific objectionable behaviors of these groups, not on the groups themselves.  This is not an issue we have raised with other contacts but can do so in the future in order to gauge reaction. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  In a conversation that predated passage of UNSCR 1747, an Iranian doctor with reportedly close connections to conservative circles discussed Iran's nuclear issue and the domestic political situation.  He predicted Iran would eventually cave to international pressure and suspend enrichment, but he clearly felt Iran was entitled to nuclear weapons to protect itself from a perceived nuclear threat from Israel.  The principal focus of his political remarks was extolling the positive influence of former Foreign Minister Velayati, who he maintained wanted to build bridges with the West.  While he did not in any way seek a "channel" between Velayati and the US, at one point he solicited USG financial backing for Velayati's next campaign run, a subject IRPO did not pursue.  We hear multiple views concerning who has the ear of the Supreme Leader, so this report should not be considered definitive by any means, but the source offered some noteworthy views regarding politics in Iran.  End summary  2.(S/NF) An Iranian doctor reportedly well connected to conservative circles discussed Iran's nuclear dilemma and domestic politics with IRPO Director in mid-March.  (He called the Supreme Leader a former patient but said he could not help his undefined problem with his arm, and said his current patients include the Supreme Leader's son and the governor of the province of Tehran, but did not say for what.)  He discussed a number of issues, including the nuclear issue, domestic politics, IRGC, Basij, and Ansar-e Hizballah (reftel).  His views on regional politics, as well as on drug abuse in Iran (he also runs a drug addiction clinic), will be reported septel.  His view: Iran will accept suspension -------------------------------------  3.(S/NF) In a conversation prior to passage of UNSCR 1747, the doctor predicted Iran will accept the enrichment suspension requirement (no time frame given), because pressure from sanctions will leave it no choice.  Nonetheless, he was very critical of what he saw as the US acting as the "arbitrator" of who can have nuclear technology and who cannot.  It was clear he believed that Iran's goal was to build nuclear weapons.  Given that he claimed "all" Iranians believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against Iran as a first strike, he appeared to feel Iran was justified in arming itself.  4.(S/NF) What troubled the doctor most was the notion that President Ahmadi-Nejad -- whom he does not support -- would reap the political benefits from any subsequent improvement of relations with the West should Iran suspend enrichment and enter into negotiations.  Rehashing the old argument from Iranians over who gets credit for any rapprochement with the US, he claimed Ahmadi-Nejad's principal goal at this point is to get reelected in 2009 and that he needed to do something to reverse his sinking popularity.  5.(S/NF) In contrast to the doctor's views, several other sources seemed to think Iran would need more incentives to suspend.  One source suggested allowing Iran to ask for a reciprocal precondition for talks, such as US first unfreezing Iran's assets.  Another source suggested Iranians could announce they have reached a percentage of enrichment which would be "acceptable" to West, then say they are stopping activity because their factories are "not ready."  Another claimed that Iran would trust the UK more than it would trust Russia to do enrichment for them.  His view: Velayati for president --------------------------------  6.(S/NF) The doctor acknowledged, however, that the call on whether or not to suspend enrichment was not the president's, but ultimately the Supreme Leader's.  He further claimed that Ali Velayati, foreign minister under President Rafsanjani, was the most influential voice on the Supreme Leader's foreign policy committee.  (Note: this is a reference to the Strategic Council for Foreign Relations, created by the Supreme Leader in June 2006 to act as an advisory panel on foreign relations.  It is not clear how influential this body has been in foreign policy decision-making.  Endnote)  The doctor maintained that  RPO DUBAI 00000014  002.2 OF 003   Ahmadi-Nejad has no voice on this committee.  7.(S/NF) The doctor, clearly a fan of Velayati, reportedly served on former FM Velayati's failed 2005 presidential campaign.  He said Velayati plans to run again in 2009, and he plans to join his campaign again.  The doctor claimed Velayati's star is rising in Iran, along with Tehran Mayor Qalibaf.  He thought Velayati made a mistake in pulling out of the 2005 election.  8.(S/NF) He claimed that Rafsanjani will not run for president again in 2009 and has already lent his support to Velayati.  He maintained that Velayati had the confidence of both the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani and that the Supreme Leader knew that any advice from Velayati already had Rafsanjani's support.  The doctor said that Velayati shares foreign policy goals with Rafsanjani and that he wants to establish ties with the rest of world.  On the other hand, he indicated differences between the two on domestic policy but did not elaborate.  (Note: He also claimed that Velayati, numerous others in politics today, and himself were members of the Hojjatiyeh prior to the revolution, which he called the "pure" resistance to the Shah.  However, he said both he and Velayati, as well as many others, had since left the group.  Endnote)  Takes money to win an election ------------------------------  9.(S/NF) The doctor accused Ahmadi-Nejad of misusing large amounts of Tehran municipal funds to buy votes during the election, such as $120 "loans" to Basij members.  He also accused current Tehran Mayor Qalibaf of corrupt practices in the election, saying he used money for his campaign that police received (not clear whether legitimately or illegitimately) for resolving problems people had with importing goods into Iran.  10.(S/NF) In what was otherwise a normal conversation with a new contact, at one point the doctor changed tacks and said the US should help pave the way for better relations by playing a role in deciding who wins the 2009 elections.  He said that it will take money to win the elections, and Velayati needs some.  He gave IRPO Director the business card of a company he said was a trading company he set up to raise funds for Velayati's campaign.  He suggested that the US allow this trading company to import goods normally blocked by sanctions to allow Velayati to start compiling funds.  IRPO Director did not pursue the matter.  When asked why Velayati would not have access to Rafsanjani's reported immense wealth if Rafsanjani was backing him, the doctor responded that Rafsanjani was under such scrutiny for corruption these days from Ahmadi-Nejad, who "hated" him, he could not risk it.  The doctor also maintained that the Iranian diaspora did not contribute money for Iranian political campaigns.  His view: Ahmadi-Nejad made many mistakes -----------------------------------------  11.(S/NF) Despite his argument about the importance of financial backing to win the presidency, the doctor underscored the Supreme Leader's role in influencing elections.  He claimed that after Khatami twice won the presidential election, the Supreme Leader decided to ensure future winners had his pre-approval. For this reason, he mobilized the IRGC and the Basij in the 2005 presidential elections, but, said the doctor, the results backfired on him.  Khameini did not realize how much influence others, particularly Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, would have on Ahmadi-Nejad.  The doctor was very critical of Ahmadi-Nejad, who he said made many mistakes in his first six months, including listening to Mesbah-Yazdi.  He said President Ahmadi-Nejad's popularity is now on the decline but that the Supreme Leader will not drop him as president.  Rumor mill ----------  12.(S/NF) Another source, an Iranian-American who travels frequently to Iran, said he heard rumors in Iran that 150 MPs were prepared to impeach Ahmadi-Nejad, but the Supreme Leader told them not to because Khameini knows he is dying.  Another source maintained that the Supreme Leader is worried that if he dies and Ahmadi-Nejad is impeached, the Islamic system will fall.  In the meantime, the Supreme Leader is reportedly trying to select his own replacement.  One source maintained that  RPO DUBAI 00000014  003.2 OF 003   Rafsanjani is proposing former President Khatami, but supposedly only because he knows the Supreme Leader will say no and then maybe consider Rafsanjani.  Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi is reportedly proposing Judiciary chief Shahrudi, while others are advocating replacing the position of supreme leader with a council.  One rumor is that the Supreme Leader is refusing chemotherapy to hide visible signs of his illness.  (Note:  It is important to note how rumor-prone Iran is.  End note)  13.(S/NF) Comment:  Another contact, a purported former IRGC general, was dismissive of Velayati's influence on foreign policy and claimed that Hassan Rohani, formerly Iran's top nuclear negotiator and now the Supreme Leader's representative on the Supreme National Security Council, has a stronger voice. We often hear different prognoses from different Iranians as to who is the ascendant power.  Some Iranians have predicted that Qalibaf or Larijani will be the next president; this is the first time we have heard the prediction for Velayati.  We would also note that while we frequently hear claims that Rafsanjani is a pragmatist seeking closer ties with the West, we hear this less said about Velayati.  In any case, all Iranian prominent figures seem to be towing the party line in statements surrounding passage of UNSCR 1747, with none right now arguing for rapprochement over enrichment.  Velayati called the UNSC's intervention in Iran's nuclear case illegal and said that Iran will not suspend uranium enrichment even for a short period of time.  He said that putting up with international pressure was the high price the country was to pay for materializing great projects such as development of nuclear energy.  He called access to the nuclear fuel cycle the redline of the ruling system on the nuclear issue.  "Iran will not withdraw from this redline but will rather use various political, international and economic levers to reduce the inevitable cost," he added.  We were surprised by the request for USG funding for Velayati, and it discredited the contact to a degree, although the rest of his comments seemed genuine.  The goal of such an inquiry may have been just to test the reaction, or it may have demonstrated our interlocutor's ignorance of US policy, despite having lived in the US 15 years.  It may also have been simply an attempt at personal gain. BURNS

RPO DUBAI 00000015  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  Despite the unpopularity of cutting subsidies at a time of high inflation, the parliament has set May 22 as the date to raise gasoline prices by 25 percent.  Parliament also put an annual cap on gasoline subsidies of USD 2.5 billion. Judging from Iranian press, general Iranian opinion toward the measure appears generally negative, with some economists forecasting "massive shockwaves" and others simply predicting increased corruption in the energy sector.  Some details of the plan are still unclear.  Contacts reported that there has been limited distribution of "smart cards" - although wide-scale rationing through fuel cards does not seem to be on the table at this time.  It will be interesting to gauge public reaction when the increase takes effect.  Reducing gasoline subsidies is a positive step for Iran's macro-economic health, but it appears to fly in the face of President Ahmadi-Nejad's populist promises of redistributing oil wealth.  It also comes at a time when Iran is likely looking to shore up domestic support for its nuclear policies in the face of international pressure through UNSC resolutions.  However, the Iranian government may be moving now to address a structural weakness in its economy and reduce its dependence on other countries in order to lessen the impact of any future gasoline embargo on the country.  End Summary.  2.(C) Fixed pump prices for the last three years boosted Iranian gasoline consumption well beyond domestic refining capabilities - forcing the government to import 40 percent of its gasoline needs.  Environmentalists bemoan the impact of this high consumption, including leaded gasoline, while Iranian parliamentarians bemoan the impact that subsidies have on the federal budget.  The Majles threatened to implement a fuel coupon system and/or to decrease gasoline subsidies last year, but until recently appeared reluctant to touch gasoline, as inexpensive fuel is widely viewed as an entitlement in the world's fourth oil producer.  However, in early March, in a time of heightened discontent with the economy and in direct contradiction to Ahmadi-Nejad's promised populist spending, the Majles passed legislation limiting Iranian gas subsidies and raising fuel costs at the pump.  Growing pressure --------------------  3.(C) Riding high on popular support for his campaign promises to bring the country's oil wealth to the people's tables, President Ahmadi-Nejad ignored former President Khatami's counsel to him to invest in industry, particularly energy sector infrastructure.  He also failed to react seriously to a June 2006 letter by 50 economists on the worrisome state of Iran's economy.  His  policy of placating the people with populist spending appeared to falter when some of his unfulfilled promises started eroding his popularity.  At the same time, his overspending sparked criticism from academics and elites, in the run-up to the December 2006 municipal elections.  Since December, public debate on Ahmadi-Nejad's economic mismanagement has dominated news sources and the minds of many Iranians. (Note: An overview of the state of the Iranian economy to be reported septel. Endnote.)  Hard decision by the Majles ---------------------------------  4.(C) In this time of public discontent with the state of the economy, the Majles passed a very unpopular two-part bill:  1) placing a USD 2.5 billion annual cap on gasoline subsidies; and 2) increasing gasoline prices, which are set by the government, from roughly 8 cents to 11 cents a liter.  The changes are to go into effect May 22.  (Note:  The Majles has postponed action on this unpopular issue before, it could do so again.  Endnote) There is discussion of further price increases after subsidies are used up, but no clarity as to how much.  In addition to curbing fuel subsidies, the Majles has also discussed rationing .  In the run-up to the Majles decision to curb subsidies, the idea of utilizing "smart" fuel ration cards, possibly with a two-tiered pricing schedule, was debated by decision makers and in the media.  Some contacts reported in January that the government was beginning to hand out ration cards, although it does not appear that legislation regarding ration cards has been passed.  The current thinking on utilizing such cards in conjunction with the subsidies is unknown.  RPO DUBAI 00000015  002.2 OF 002    New bill:  insufficient or overly ambitious? ------------------------------------  5.(C) Public reaction to subsidy caps and price increases, albeit consistently pessimistic, runs the spectrum from believing the measures to be insufficient to perceiving them as overly ambitious.  According to a March 8 Financial Times article, Majles deputy Mahmoud Abtahi warned that a 25 percent hike in pump prices would cause a "severe shock because petrol is the life blood of the economy."  Abtahi urged parliament to help off-set the financial hit to low-income groups.  The same article cited Iran Economics editor Heydar Pourian as saying that a 25 percent price increase was "psychologically bearable and not much above inflation."  Business newspaper Sarmayeh carried an editorial March 8 indicating that the subsidy cap was a good first step, but not enough.  It argued that the problem facing Iran is two-fold, low-prices and high consumption, and that the bill only addresses the former.  An  economist contact predicted to IRPOff that any increase in gas prices, particularly any form of rationing or two-tier pricing, will result in greater corruption in the energy sector, similar to "the last time the government tried rationing."  (Note:  A rationing system used during the Iran-Iraq war was reportedly heavily exploited by those with close government ties.  Endnote)   6.(C) Comment:  The Majles is finally taking difficult steps that will provide long-term economic benefits to combat Iranian economic mismanagement and end the substantial drain on foreign reserves caused by the gasoline subsidy.  This is a positive step in economic terms, whatever the motivation.  The driving factor for taking such an unpopular measure at this sensitive time, however, may be to insulate the country from a possible US or UN gasoline boycott for Iran, given that the idea has already circulated in the media and in the US Congress.  Iran can reduce its vulnerability to such a future step by reducing gasoline imports now, while at the same time reducing  Iran's dependence on foreign countries, long a foreign policy priority.  As part of this policy, it is also planning to bring new refineries on-line, but of course, this is a longer-term solution.  As long as US policy remains to try to target the impact of sanctions on the Iranian government and not the Iranian people, a gasoline boycott is probably not a good option.  While it would have a significant impact on Iran, it is difficult to gauge its impact on popular opinion and may have the reverse impact as the one we desire.  Although it is difficult to generalize, a rise in gasoline prices by the Iranian government could increase its unpopularity in the minds of the Iranian people; a rise in gasoline prices triggered by a foreign-imposed boycott could boost solidarity with the government.  IRPO will continue to monitor both public reaction to and implementation of the new gasoline policy. BURNS

Antipathy towards Israel runs far deeper than antipathy towards the US, and one source claims "all" Iranians believe Israel would use a nuclear weapon against Iran in a first strike.  While the doctor says it was a mistake for Iran to fund terrorist groups, he maintains it cannot abandon them now or risk losing honor.  The general says Iran can do a lot more to monitor the Iran-Iraq border and that US and Iran can come to terms on Iraq prior to reaching a broader resolution of issues.  End summary  2.(S/NF) A purported former IRGC general and an Iranian doctor who is reportedly very close to conservative circles in Iran, discussed Iran's external affairs.  Both were introduced to IRPO Director in separate meetings by a longstanding Iranian-American contact.  Their comments on the IRGC, the Basij, and Ansar-e Hizballah, as well as the nuclear and domestic situation are reported in reftels.  US-Iran relations -----------------  3.(S/NF) The doctor said he does not see US-Iran conflict as inevitable and can envision friendly negotiations in mutual respect with the US, but he does not think complete resolution of all issues possible, saying both sides would need to agree to differ on some issues.  That said, he claimed Iran's relations with the US would improve if the US reduced its support for Israel.  The doctor claimed Iran is "begging" for relations with the US, but individuals within the government are wary of advocating such steps, afraid of getting burned.  He claimed that 70% of Iranians openly support relations with the US and a further 20% want relations but are too nervous to admit it publicly.  In his view, Iran is better off dealing with the US than with Syria, because Iranians "can't trust Syrians," saying they break their word.  Israel ------  4.(S/NF) The doctor maintained that "all" Iranians believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against them in a first strike.  (His views on the Iranian nuclear issue are reported in ref B.)  When asked why not try to resolve the bilateral issues between Iran and Israel, he replied that while he can envision negotiations with the US, negotiations with Israel are "inconceivable."  5.(S/NF) The doctor also repeated a frequently heard claim that the Israeli government currently has influence within the Iranian government.  He accused Israel of deliberately creating discord within the IRIG, to "divide and conquer."  For instance, he said, when high levels make a decision, but lower levels of government interfere with implementation, that's the work of the Israelis.  The doctor maintained, without explaining, that President Ahmadi-Nejad's motivation for staging the conference on the Holocaust was to counter Israeli influence inside the Iranian government.  6.(S/NF) The former general, when asked about the issues between Iran and Israel, cited Iran's historically good relations with Jews, claiming it was instead Arabs and Jews who were always in conflict.  He maintained that the onus was now on Israel to build trust about its long-term intentions.  Iranians believe that Israel wants to expand its territory from the Nile in Egypt to the Furat river in Iraq, he claimed.  7.(S/NF) When asked about the source of antagonism with Israel, the general said there were a few issues that penetrated the revolution that were not "natural."  He blamed the influence of Palestinians who prior to the revolution trained Iranian revolutionary fighters in Lebanon.  After seizing power, those Iranians were sympathetic to Palestinians, he said.  Some of  RPO DUBAI 00000016  002.2 OF 003   these Palestinian protigis went on to establish the IRGC. Iranians later broke with the PLO when Arafat supported Saddam Hussein, but he claimed that sympathy for Palestinians endured within this group.  (He also said the same thing happened with communists in Iran.  Communists took part in the revolution but were later "killed off."  Nonetheless, Marxist economic thinking prevailed, resulting in an economy that is "70%" state controlled.)  Support for terrorist groups ----------------------------  8.(S/NF) One of the issues the doctor felt could not be resolved initially in any negotiations with the US would be Iran's support for Hizballah.  He said Iran cannot withdraw support for groups like Hizballah and Hamas, a matter of honor.  Firstly, Iran sees itself as the champion for Shia, and secondly, links to such groups gives Iran a role in the region.  He said Iranian support for Hizballah is partially a response to current realities, but partially a future investment in case Israel tries again to occupy Lebanese territory.  That said, he accepted that Hizballah's pretext of Shebaa Farms as a justification for fighting Israel was weak.  9.(S/NF) The doctor freely admitted that Iranians do not like the fact that Iran sends money to Palestinian groups.  He claimed that 95% Iranians don't care about Palestinians and said Arafat was called a "prostitute" in Iran.  In his view, funding these groups (Note: it was not clear if he was including Hizballah.  Endnote) was a mistake from the beginning, but he maintained it would be too costly in terms of honor for Iran to abandon them now.  He drew a parallel to the American situation in Iraq, claiming that the US now "knows" that invading Iraq was a mistake but believes the costs of walking away would be too high.  Sunni extremism ---------------  10.(S/NF) The general called Sunni extremism Iran's biggest enemy.  The doctor claimed Sunni extremists hate Shia more than they hate the US and said Al-Qaida had burned Iran.   Although the doctor did not clarify whether he was speaking with any degree of knowledge, he said that after Iran had treated Al-Qaida with a degree of tolerance, allowing passage and treating those under house arrest well, Al-Qaida paid back Iran with its statements against Shia.  Iraq ----  11.(S/NF) The doctor maintained that Iran "has to be" present in Iraq to support Shia as a matter of honor.  He claimed that "80%" of Iranian activities in Iraq are not related to violence.  Furthermore, he said, it is not in Iran's interest to end up in conflict with the US there.  12.(S/NF) The general claimed to know the Iran-Iraq border well from his war experience and said Iran can do a lot more to monitor the border.  In his opinion, US and Iran can come to an agreement on Iraq issues prior to resolving bilateral issues, but that discussions behind the scenes between intelligence agencies were more important than diplomatic meetings.  Regional relations ------------------  13.(S/NF) The former general repeated the claim often heard from Iranians that Persian Gulf countries are not actually afraid of Iran, that these countries lie to the US to get US assistance. When asked about Saudi concerns that Iran may try to stir up unrest in the Saudi Shia population, he dismissed the notion and instead accused Saudi religious elements of working with Pakistani intelligence to stir up the Baloch population.  14.(S/NF) When asked about March 5, 2007 Sunday Telegraph story in which a former Iranian consul general to Dubai claimed to disclose intelligence activities of the consulate and contingency plans for attacks in Dubai in case of Israeli or US attacks, he said he had no knowledge of the claims.  He said only that he would not be surprised if Hizballah is funded from Dubai.  He maintained that "all" such groups have some kind of  RPO DUBAI 00000016  003.2 OF 003   presence here and claimed that Usama bin Ladin owns a shopping center in Dubai.  In any case, he doubted Iran would order attacks in Dubai, given the role it plays as Iran's economic window to the world. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary: Iranian women's rights activists are emerging as the country's most assertive dissident force, eclipsing most other key pro-reform constituencies in Iran. During the Khatami presidency from 1997-2005, students and journalists constituted the leading edge of reform and political activism.  With some exceptions, women adopted quieter tactics during that time to promote change in the Iranian legal system's treatment of women.  Since early 2006, however, women's rights activists in Iran have become increasingly vocal and visible, resisting the new administration's efforts to stymie the voice of civil society. These women have a clear and specific agenda -- legal reform to end laws that they consider discriminatory to women.  Their efforts are now at the forefront of the reform movement in Iran, and they are bearing the brunt of the Iranian government's efforts to contain civil society. End summary.  Recent history of women's rights in Iran ----------------------------------------  2.(SBU) The fate of the women's rights movement in Iran is currently at the forefront of civil society in Iran in general. Under President Khatami, the women's movement scored an important victory.  Following months of efforts, the reformist sixth Majles approved the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on June 23, 2003.  However, the conservative Guardian Council vetoed adoption of CEDAW, saying it violated both Iranian and Islamic law.  3.(SBU) Since August 2005, the Ahmadi-Nejad administration, which fears that an active civil society will produce a "velvet revolution" in Iran, has cracked down strongly on intellectuals, scholars, journalists, and non-governmental organizations inside the country.  The crackdown gained steam with the April 2006 arrest of prominent intellectual Ramin Jahanbegloo, following his travel to the US and other countries for academic conferences and research.  4.(SBU) The government's efforts, however, have not stifled activism on the part of women's groups, although these activists have also suffered harassment, travel bans, and arrests as a result.  Though many activists continued their efforts, relatively little was heard about the women's rights movement in Iran until early 2006.  On March 8, 2006, security forces disrupted a rally to celebrate International Women's Day in Tehran.  They used force to disperse demonstrators, bringing greater international attention to the women's rights movement in Iran.  Women's rights activists later organized a demonstration on June 12 in Tehran to call for reform of the Iranian legal system.  Again, security forces forcibly disrupted the June demonstration and arrested several demonstrators.  The women were protesting laws that state, for example, that a woman's life and her court testimony are worth half that of a man's, and that married women cannot obtain divorces, custody of their children after the age of seven, or travel outside the country without their husband's permission.  Iranian law also states that death by stoning is the appropriate punishment for adultery.  5.(SBU) Women's groups are also increasingly using petitions as a method to protest and draw international attention to key women's rights issues. In late 2006, women's groups in Iran began a petition calling for an end to the practice of stoning, and other petitions protesting specific cases of stoning convictions were also circulated. A petition campaign entitled "One Million Signatures Demanding Changes to Discriminatory Laws" was also launched in August 2006.  Campaigners intend to go door-to-door to obtain the referenced million signatures for their petition.  One benefit of this tactic, campaigners say, is that it will increase awareness among Iranian women about their legal status, even if some women do not sign the petition.  The women's rights movement in 2007 -----------------------------------  6.(C) Five women's rights activists -- Nooshin Ahmadi Khorasani, Parvin Ardalan, Shahla Entesari, Sussan Tahmasebi (who also holds US citizenship), and Fariba Davoodi Mohajer -- were later put on trial for organizing the June 2006 demonstration. The five women are also organizing members of the "One Million Signatures" campaign.  They are charged with "acting against national security."  (Note: Fariba Davoodi Mohajer was in the US at the time of the court date and thus escaped arrest. Endnote) Their trial date was set for March 4, 2007, only four days,  RPO DUBAI 00000017  002.2 OF 002   before International Women's Day.  Many observers speculated that the trial date was chosen deliberately to deter another rally.  Women's groups organized a rally in 2007 nonetheless, which was mired with similar violence against demonstrators.  7.(U) On the day of the trial, women's groups held a demonstration outside of the courthouse, to show solidarity with the women on trial.  Police used force to disperse demonstrators and arrested several of them.  When the women being tried protested the treatment of the demonstrators, they too were arrested. Khorasani, Ardalan, Entesari, and Tahmasebi were taken to Evin prison, along with 29 arrested demonstrators; a total of 33 arrested.  Domestic press reports indicate that 30 of the women were detained for less than a week, and then released. Authorities held three prominent activists -- Shadi Sadr, Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh, and Jila Baniyaghoub -- until the final days of the Iranian year 1385, which ended March 21, 2007.  Travel bans and NGO closures ----------------------------  8. (SBU) On January 26, 15 women journalists were detained by authorities as they attempted to travel to India for an educational workshop on journalism.  Three of the women were taken to Evin prison and held for 24 hours, and are reported to be facing trial in April on charges of "acting against national security" by planning to participate in the journalism workshop.  The women were reportedly interrogated about their possible connections with organizations that have received foreign funding.  9. (U) In late March, three prominent NGOs -- Iran CSOs Training and Research Center (ICTRC), Raahi Legal Center, and Non-Governmental Organizations Training Center -- were shut down by the government.  The latter two NGOs were founded by Shadi Sadr and Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh respectively, two of the activists arrested March 4.  10.(C) Comment: The government's paranoia of a velvet revolution orchestrated by the West is part of its motivation for pressuring civil society in Iran, including the women's movement.  Another motivation is clashes on religious grounds between the conservative government and the more liberal women's movement, as evidenced by Ahmadi-Nejad's immediate step to reorient the women's affairs office established by Khatami to a family issues office. The government's efforts to silence this movement are also consistent with an overall strategy of increasing "unity and solidarity" among the public (i.e. suppressing dissent) in the face of increasing international pressure over its nuclear program.  11.(C) Comment cont'd: It is also worth noting that in contrast to most other countries in the region, women in Iran are not fighting for rights they have never had.  Rather, they are fighting in part to regain rights they enjoyed prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is unclear how significant of a constituency the arrested women represent; while anecdotal reports suggest that dissatisfaction with the Islamic Republic's policies on women's issues is widespread, only a very small percentage of Iranian women have actively engaged in efforts to confront the government.  However, even if they represent only a small elite, the women's activists currently under fire in Iran could play a critical role in mobilizing a more assertive reform movement in Iran through their linkages with other reform actors and the broad societal sympathy toward their aims.

CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  A long-time contact believes it is in the current Iranian government's interest to start a military skirmish with the West to allow the government to exert far greater control over civil society, distract attention from economic woes, and silence Expediency Council head Rafsanjani. He believed the government was using the stand-off with the UK over the detained British sailors for this purpose.  He also claimed that the Iranian government was restricting the spectrum of political views within policymaking circles.  Many sides seem increasingly nervous about the danger of an accident sparking escalation.  End summary  2.(S) A long-time contact, a Dubai-based business man who travels frequently to Tehran and claims to interact with a wide swath of influential individuals inside Iran, claimed that it is in the current Iranian government's interest to fuel a military confrontation with the West.  A view shared by a number of IRPO interlocutors, he said that such a confrontation would allow the Iranian government to control civil society to the extent seen immediately following the 1979 revolution.  A military row would also distract domestic focus away from current economic difficulties and unite the people, said the businessman. Furthermore, such a clash would silence criticism from Expediency Council head Rafsanjani.  3.(S) Along these lines, the contact saw the March 23 detention of the British sailors/marines as a deliberate attempt to push the West into greater conflict.  He also believed the Iranians sought out British for this operation as a less risky stand-in for Americans, fearing a harsher reaction from the US.  4.(S) The contact also thought that breadth of viewpoints available to policymakers in Iran was constricting.  For instance, he claimed that the type of political analyst who could understand the implication of an offer from Secretary Rice to sit at the negotiation table with Iranians has been sidelined in recent months.  He cited as an example a long-time friend and geo-political expert (unnamed) who previously taught geo-political courses for the IRGC and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  After attending a (presumably Track II) meeting with Americans in Greece nine months ago, the expert was reportedly "harassed," and his career began a slow descent.  He is now an advisor at a state oil company and wants no involvement in politics.  5.(S) Comment.  The idea that hardliners in Iran are seeking greater tensions to silence critics, unite the population, and divert attention away from economic and civil society concerns has been reported to IRPoffs by other contacts.  While it is difficult to discern the truth of the claim, it certainly appears Iran is using its seizure of the British sailors to prove its "toughness," after facing repeated "humiliations" on the international political front.  On the other hand, it is likely that Iranians thought targeting British rather than Americans would temper the reaction.  In any case, many seem increasingly nervous that a blunder on any side could accidentally spark a quick military escalation.  BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  Iran:  Social Factors Increasing HIV Rates  1.(C) Summary:  The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Iran is accelerating, mostly due to use of intravenous drugs.  Iran's total number of HIV cases has almost doubled in the past two years, and intravenous (IV) drug users account for 63% of the country's total cases.  The highest HIV prevalence rates are among IV drug users in large cities and prisons.  According to one Iranian expert, however, the disease is spreading rapidly and starting to cross over into the general population, apparently linked to increasing sexual promiscuity.  End summary.  Concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemic established among Iran's IV drug users --------------------------------------------- -------------- ----------  2.(C) The HIV epidemic in Iran is accelerating, according to an Iranian infectious disease doctor, who confirmed the country's official and UN published HIV/AIDS data.  The doctor is an AIDS researcher from Iran's primary AIDS Research Center at the University of Tehran, which is partially supported by the office of the Iranian president.  UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS) and the Iranian Ministry of Health estimate that there are 70 thousand HIV/AIDS cases in Iran, although the number of reported cases is under 14 thousand.  HIV prevalence in the general population is still low at 0.1%, but this number is increasing quickly.  Iran's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization confirm that HIV/AIDS cases in Iran have almost doubled in the past two years and that localized epidemics exist among IV drug users.  IV drug use currently accounts for 63% of Iran's total HIV/AIDS cases, sexual transmission accounts for 7.3%, infected blood products 2% and mother to child transmission 0.4%; transmission routes are unknown in about 30% of cases.  HIV prevalence among IV drug users is highest in large cities and prisons; with rates of 23% among IV drug users in Tehran and 25% in Shiraz Prison.  3.(S) The doctor noted that HIV infection rates and incidence in the general population are both on the rise.  According to Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Iran has an estimated 3.7 million drug users, and 137,000 inject drugs. Unofficial estimates for drug use in Iran are as high as 7 million.  Prevalence among IV drug users was about 15% in 2004, mainly among low socioeconomic drug users, but now 25% of the injecting drug users examined are infected.  The doctor, who previously ran the AIDS research center in a major city, said that the highest HIV/AIDS incidences are among IV users in Kermanshah, Fars, Lorestan, and Tehran.   Increase in recreational drug use ---------------------------------  4.(C) According to the Iranian HIV/AIDS expert, one reason for the rise in HIV is a general increase in recreational drug use. Drug use has a long history in Iran and smoking of natural herbs and opiates is traditional in the region, although possession of drugs is forbidden by Iranian law.  Several Iranian visa applicants said that smoking hashish and opium is not taken very seriously in Iran, though injecting hard drugs is looked at quite differently.  Some Iranians claim that some clerics use opium and two recent contacts claimed that Supreme Leader Khamenei, and former Foreign Minister Velayati smoke opium. What was traditionally a social activity for older males is now spreading to females and youth.  At the same time, abuse of other synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamines are also increasing.  5.(U) Narcotics reports say that opium, which is traditionally smoked, has become increasingly expensive in Iran.  Many drug users are attracted by the cheap prices of synthetic and cut opiates such as heroin, which are extremely addictive and cause people to quickly turn to injection where they can get the same affect with a smaller cheaper dose.  According to the Iranian AIDS doctor, a heroin dose is about 2000 tomans or about two dollars.  6.(C) According to two Iranian parents of teenagers, drugs are becoming more accessible for young people, but schools are conducting anti-drug campaigns.  Parents are increasingly watchful of this issue, they said, and try to engage their kids in hobbies.  One mother said she thinks children are becoming  RPO DUBAI 00000019  002.2 OF 002   more defiant as a response to the restrictive lifestyle in Iran.   Shifts in social norms ----------------------  7.(C) At the same time, Iran's culture as a whole is shifting toward greater sexual activity.  Within the sector of drug users, an UNAIDS published behavioral study from 2004 among injecting drug users in a drug treatment center indicated that 41% of the sexually active participants had over six partners, 42% of them had exchanged money for sex, and 50% never used condoms.  In the general population, 70% of the country's population is under the age of 30, divorce rates are increasing, and people are getting married later, if at all.  Such factors are likely to increases the number of sexual partners people have (including prostitutes), increasing the risk of infection. There is also the practice of "sigheh," which allows for temporary marriages with the blessing of a cleric, even for one night, which some say is used at times to skirt the illegality of prostitution.  Some Iranian men who travel in the region reportedly return with HIV and infect their wives, according to several Iranian visa applicants.  In a 2005 study published in Middle East and North Africa's 2006 AIDS Epidemic Update, some 28% of 15-18 year old males in Tehran were sexually active, yet about half of this group had never seen a condom or knew they could prevent STDs, despite the availability of free condoms in health clinics.  They believed HIV could be transmitted by mosquitoes or acquired in swimming pools.  8.(C) Though little is being done in Iran to monitor HIV among prostitutes, the disease is reportedly increasing among Iran's prostitute communities.  According to a study published in the UNAIDS Iran report, one group of women prostitutes in western Tehran had a 6% infection rate.  More people are becoming infected through unsafe sex, specifically through prostitution, according to the Iranian AIDS expert.  She explained that the overlap between injecting drug use and sex for money facilitates the spread of HIV to the general population, as clients of prostitutes spread the disease to their partners.  However, because prostitution is illegal, underground, and stigmatized, it is difficult to survey this group, according to the expert. There is a lack of information on this marginalized group and issues of sex are still too sensitive to address publicly, added the doctor. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  IRPoffs met February 12 with an Iranian/US Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) who has business interests in Dubai. According to the single source, Rafsanjani recently purchased 2 billion USD worth of property near Dubai's Festival City, through his brother-in-law Marashi.  The contact noted that while international pressure on Iranian banks has limited formal trade and investment between the UAE and Iran, the "informal market" is booming.  He claimed one neighborhood in Dubai is "full of money exchangers" and that it is easy to find unregistered hawalas; a traditional network of brokers who transfer money outside of recognized banking channels.  The contact claimed that at least 50 percent if not up to 70 percent of the new Business Bay district in Dubai is owned by Iranians and that 30 percent of the rapidly expanding luxury housing and shopping projects in Dubai Marina are Iranian investments. Regarding reverse investment in Iran, an Iranian-born, Emirati banker claimed to IRPoffs February 11 that while the UAE government is not investing in Iran, private Emirati citizens are doing so, citing sugar and retail investments, as well as hospitals and real estate markets.  While none of these deals likely run afoul of current US and UN regulations, it would appear that the current international face-off with Iran has not stopped UAE investment there.  End Summary  Iranian investment in UAE --------------------------------  2.(S) IRPOoffs discussed Iranian investment in Dubai February 12 with an Iranian/US LPR businessman based in Dubai.  The contact has been a Consulate Dubai contact for several years.  Although he frequently travels to Iran, he openly calls for regime change in his meetings with US officials.  According to the single-source, Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani recently spent 2 billion USD on property near Festival City in Dubai, a new shopping and resort district under construction on the north side of  Dubai's creek.  The purchase was reportedly made through his sister's husband, Hossain Marashi.  According to the contact, Iranians own "at least 50 percent if not up to 70 percent" of  Business Bay -- a business, commercial and residential free zone under construction -- and 30 percent of the rapidly expanding luxury housing and shopping projects in Dubai Marina.  Conversely, a Tehran-based businessman claimed that investment in Dubai from Iran is waning in favor of Kazakhstan and Bulgaria.  3.(S) The Iranian/US LPR asserted that while formal trade and investment ties with Iran and the international community are under strain due to recent actions by the US and the UN, the "informal market" between the UAE and Iran is booming.  The contact claimed the Arbift building in the Deira area of Dubai houses a number of Iranian businesses and many "money exchanges."  Turning to hawalas, the businessman stated, "I could take you by the hand and bring you to a shop that sells automobile belts in Nasser Square." (Note: also known as Baniyas Square and is located in Deira at the junction of Baniyas and Maktoum Streets.  Endnote).  "Behind the shop front, there is a back room where yahoo instant messenger sends constant updates about money exchanges to be made."   The contact also noted that cash is often carried via suitcase into Dubai.  According to the single source, Dubai customs will simply prepare a receipt noting how much cash a person claims to be carrying carried in (Note.  Officially, any amounts above 10,000 USD must be claimed.  Endnote)  Although reputation-conscious financial institutions in Dubai may not accept large cash deposits hand carried into the country, he claimed "many" institutions and individuals will.  UAE investment in Iran -------------------------------  4.(S) In a meeting with an Iranian-born, Emirati banker February 11 IRPoffs were told that while the UAE government is not investing in Iran, private Emirati citizens are "quietly" doing so.   The banker said that the Al FuttQ family plans to build 50 stores of the French grocery chain Carrefour, for which they own the local franchise, throughout Iran - and that two are currently under way.  The Emirati banker also noted that an unspecified local sugar magnate (believed to be Jebel Ali-based Al Khaleej Sugar owned by Jamal Majed Al Ghurair) invests quite  RPO DUBAI 00000005  002.2 OF 002   heavily in Iran's sugar market.  Furthermore, said the source, Emiratis are investing in real estate and hospitals across Iran.  A separate source who works with a company linked to the Dubai government said the old local Iranian families are investing in Iran, also citing the Al Futtaim family.  This source also said there was investment from Ras al Khaimah into Iran.  He said his office was considering a development deal in Iran but doubted they would do it.  He was arguing against doing it, saying no one makes any money there.  5.(S) Comment.  It is difficult to obtain a true picture of Iranian investments in Dubai because of the informal nature of many of the investments and the anecdotal/poor quality of the data.  Additionally, if all rumors were to be believed regarding Rafsanjani's investments in Dubai, he would rival the ruler in the amount of property held.  The Banker's remarks about the UAEG not investing in Iran track with what we have heard about large Emirate level government investors, such as ADIA.  Up till now, we had heard rumors of UAE private sector investments in Iran but few details.  While these reverse investments may not run afoul of current US or UN sanctions, they are worth tracking.  We have previously raised concerns about the potential of UAE private sector investments tied to the Iranian hydrocarbon sector (i.e., Dana Gas see reftel) and warned about the potential for misuse of the UAE financial system by Iran. Although the UAE government might say that these particular private investment are out of their direct control, it might be useful to raise them as areas of concern as we develop more substantial information.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  According to a Dubai-based Iranian entrepreneur, private Iranian banks are not faring well.  In particular, he predicted that Saman Bank will soon be bankrupt.  The contact opined that the Iranian government has done more to damage cash flows in and out of Iran than recent actions taken by the US and the UN.  In his opinion,  US and UN actions only harm honest, legitimate business entities, as anyone wanting to move money and goods can do so via informal - and not always legal - networks.  The businessman claimed that he is one of a handful of local Iranians engaged in legitimate business and not simply operating in Dubai to circumvent sanctions.  He said in fact he no longer tries to conduct much business in Iran, because of the difficult operating climate.  Regarding Iranian presence in Iraq, he  claimed that some IRGC members there are actually retired and now in business.  They are among the few businessmen who can "stomach" the investment climate and security environment there.  End Summary.  Iranian banking ----------------  2.(S) In a February 13 conversation,  a local Iranian entrepreneur told IRPoff that private banks in Iran are not faring well.  He claimed that Saman Bank (owned by Khodro car manufacturers) is on the verge of bankruptcy because it overextended itself by opening letters of credit (LCs) valued at 2.5  times its actual collateral.  In general, stated the entrepreneur, private Iranian banks offer loans and extend LCs on much more relaxed terms than state-owned banks.  Despite the fact that private banks charge higher rates than the government imposed rates used by state banks, "easier" terms and a focus on customer service have attracted customers away from state banks.   3.(S) When asked if recent US and UN actions against Iran have impacted the price of LCs, the businessman said "one week after you took action, the Central Bank stopped all LCs in Iran." (Note: it was not clear if he was referring to  US Treasury action or UNSC resolution 1737. Endnote)  He continued, "I don't know why they did that.  Their restrictions have done more to harm business than anything the international community could have done."  Reportedly, LCs are being opened again in Iran - albeit on a much slower basis.  The contact said a committee at the Central Bank has to review every request for an LC.  If opening a letter of credit from Dubai, the businessman said it is much better to use Standard Chartered than Dubai-based Iranian banks - as the rates are better at Standard Chartered. He said he had used HSBC in the past as well, but HSBC cut all of its business ties with Iran.  Impact of US and UNSC actions -----------------------------  4.(S) The contact noted that in recent years "many" Iranians moved to Dubai and set up local companies with the express purpose of circumventing US sanctions.  The entrepreneur claimed that he is one of a handful of Iranians based in Dubai with an almost wholly UAE market.  He said if necessary, he could cut off all ties with Iran and remain in business.  He  claimed that US Treasury actions and UNSCR 1737 only serve to hurt legitimate business entities - like himself - who use formal, legal means to transfer goods and money.  He said that individuals who want to get around the sanctions are able to do so through informal channels. Because of the extensive network between Dubai and Iran, the contact claimed that informal systems to move goods and money are quite deep-rooted.  He claimed that one method to illegally move money from Iran to Dubai is to open an LC in Dubai and have the money transferred from Iran - absent any actual shipment of goods.  The contact said all that is needed is a falsified bill of lading and certificate of origin. (Note: similar information reported in reftel by separate source. Endnote)  IRGC in Iraq ----------------  5.(S) The contact noted that Iran has historic ties to many countries in the region, and Iraq is no different.  The  RPO DUBAI 00000006  002.2 OF 002   businessman claimed that some of what appears to be IRGC presence there may be in fact former IRGC members now engaged in business activities.  The contact noted that former IRGC members are much more comfortable doing business in Iraq than the average individual.  They are used to hostile environments, he said.  It is possible they pass on information to the Iranian government, he said, just like a former US official working in the private sector abroad may continue to share information with the US government.  (Note: The contact claimed ongoing friendships with former IRGC members from his time of mandatory military service, although he did not indicate whether he had done his service in that branch. Endnote)  6.(S) Comment:  The contact indicated his motivation for speaking with IRPoff was a personal desire to promote positive US-Iran relations.  Although critical of the Iranian government, he caveated all of his comments by noting that he sees himself as a mediator - trying to tell both sides the truth.  He offered to arrange a meeting for IRPO with the new Iranian Ambassador to the UAE, former Foreign Ministry spokesman Asefi, which we respectfully declined.  He commented that he was surprised by the appointment of someone as senior as Asefi to the UAE and mused whether it was a reaction to IRPO's presence here.  He claimed that Asefi was relatively open-minded.   In addition, the businessman clearly  wanted to persuade the US that the current sanctions regime on Iran more negatively impacted legitimate businesses operating through formal, legal channels, not  the Iranian government and illegal trade.  Whether these were self-serving or genuine comments is not known. End Comment. BURNS

Bet Kolia will lead a delegation of Iranian Assyrians to an Assyrian National Congress meeting March 24-25 in California. According to Bet Kolia, there have been no recent changes in the status of the Assyrian community in Iran, but he said the situation for Assyrians in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan is very poor.  The MP indicated that during his upcoming planned visit to the US, he would likely meet with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo of the 14th district in California, who is of Assyrian descent.  He added that when he spoke with some officials from the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Ettela'at) about the possibility of parliamentary exchanges between Iran and the US, they were receptive and encouraging.  End Summary.  2. (S//NF) IRPOffs met February 22 with the Assyrian representative (MP) in the Iranian Majles, Yonathan Bet Kolia. (Note: Five seats in the Iranian Majles are designated specifically for religious minorities.  There is one representative each from the Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Assyrian communities, and two from the Armenian community. End Note.) The Assyrian MP was in Dubai to apply for a US visa in order to attend a meeting of the Assyrian National Congress, an organization that brings together representatives from Assyrian communities across the world.  He has attended similar meetings in the US in the past.  The meeting will be held in Ceres, California on March 24-25.  Traveling with Mr. Bet Kolia will be nine other members of the Assyrian community in Iran, representing various Assyrian organizations inside the country. The MP spoke about the current status of the Assyrian community in Iran, and also commented on status of Assyrians in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan.  Assyrians in Iran -----------------  3. (S//NF)  Prior to the Iranian revolution there were 70,000-80,000 Assyrians in Iran, the MP said.  (Note:  Assyrians in Iran refer to their language as Assyrian, and describe themselves as Assyrian, rather than Chaldean, Syriac, or other similar names that have been used to describe this ancient Christian community.  This Iranian delegation to the Assyrian National Congress plans to promote the singular use of the term "Assyrian" to describe the members of this community worldwide. End Note.)  During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, many Assyrians fled the country, particularly families with sons who were eligible for conscription.  Families sent their sons to the West to avoid frontline military service, and then joined them as soon as they could.  Currently, there are no more than 30,000 Assyrians in Iran, the MP estimated.  Before the Khatami presidency, religious minorities did not receive government funding on a regular basis.  Employers regularly discriminated against non-Muslims, calling for "Muslims only" in job advertisements, despite the constitution providing for equal employment rights to all recognized religious minorities. (Note: According to the Iranian constitution, Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities.  End Note.)  When discrimination in the employment sector was brought to Khatami's attention the practice stopped, the MP said. Furthermore, a budget for religious minorities (providing funding for schools, cultural centers, sports etc.) was made into a necessary line-item in the government budget, and it would require an additional law to remove it.  Religious minorities (as a group, not individually) have received approximately $2 million annually from the government since the Khatami years, according to the MP.  4. (S//NF) The Khatami presidency saw many improvements for recognized religious minorities in Iran, and Ahmadinejad has kept the same policies in place, the Assyrian MP noted. However, the Majles is attempting to decrease the budget for religious minorities for the upcoming year.  The budget bill is still under discussion in the Majles, so the outcome is not yet clear. (Note: The Iranian year 1386 begins March 21, 2007. End Note.) The MP inferred that the attempted decrease in the budget is a result of Iran's overall economic woes, rather than an action targeted against religious minorities.  Mr. Bet Kolia is attempting to have the budget for the Assyrian community  RPO DUBAI 00000007  002.2 OF 002   separated from the overall budget for religious minorities in the upcoming year.  The Assyrian community has separate schools but opens them to children of all religions.  They are permitted to teach classes in the Assyrian language, and also write their own textbooks, which the government then prints for them.  The government pays the salaries of the teachers, but the teachers are Assyrian.  The situation for Assyrians inside Iran is fairly good, particularly in comparison with the status of Assyrian community in nearby countries, the MP commented.  Assyrians in Iraq -----------------  5. (S//NF)  The Iranian Assyrian MP estimated that 250,000 Assyrians have fled Iraq since the beginning of the war in 2003, also estimating a high number (NFI) of internally displaced persons among Assyrians in Iraq. The MP related one egregious case of a young Assyrian woman who was kidnapped for ransom. He claimed she was beheaded when the family was unable to pay the ransom and her boiled head returned to the family.  He described the current situation for Assyrians in Iraq as very poor.  The MP claimed there is a movement to promote the creation of an Assyrian homeland, to be located most likely in Nineveh province in Iraq, and hinted at desire for third country support.  The MP inferred it is not a separatist movement but one that seeks the creation of an autonomous region within the larger country.  He stressed that under no circumstances could the Assyrian homeland be under the control of the Kurds.  The Assyrians, he said, hold the Kurds responsible for a reported massacre of Assyrians in Iraq in 1933.   He also mentioned the assassination decades ago of the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church, although it was unclear whether he was insinuating Kurdish involvement in that assassination.  Assyrians in Jordan and Syria -----------------------------  6. (S//NF) The MP stated that there are an estimated 120,000 Assyrian refugees from Iraq in Jordan.  He claimed Assyrian refugees in Jordan face extreme poverty, and a number of women and children are forced into prostitution in order to feed their families.  The Assyrian community in Syria, which the MP estimated at 60,000, faces government restrictions on their freedom to congregate.  When the MP approached Assyrian organizations in Syria to suggest that the larger Assyrian community hold a conference in Syria, they said it wasn't possible.  When he offered to go to the Syrian Embassy in Iran to request permission, they pleaded with him not to do so.  The MP also gave an estimate of the Assyrian community in Turkey as approximately 40,000.  He also said that SARG claims after the film "Passion of the Christ" that it would help support promotion of the Assyrian language came to nothing.  Parliamentary Exchanges? ------------------------  7. (S//NF)  The Assyrian Majles representative indicated that during his upcoming planned visit to the US, he would likely meet with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, from California's 14th congressional district, who is of Assyrian descent.  (Note: This is likely not their first meeting. End Note.)  The MP talked about that meeting in a strictly Assyrian context, but also discussed the broader idea of contact between members of the Iranian and US legislatures.  The MP said that he spoke with officials from the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Ettela'at) prior to leaving the country to apply for a US visa, and mentioned the possibility of parliamentary exchanges between Iran and US.  The officials were receptive to the idea, he said, and encouraged him to pursue it.  8. (S//NF) Comment: MP Bet Kolia underscored that the situation for Assyrians in Iran is largely unchanged and superior to that in Iraq or Syria, where old communities exist, and in Jordan, among the Iraqi refugee community.

RPO DUBAI 00000009  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian L. Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  A well-connected Iranian professor criticized the Ahmadinejad's government for gross mismanagement and claimed that large portions of the population had turned against him.  A clear Rafsanjani supporter, he claimed the Expediency Council is the one person in Iranian politics who can act as a counterweight to the Supreme Leader.  The contact appeared to have a good understanding of Western perspectives of Iran, based on his years studying in the US and the UK.  His insights into Rafsanjani are useful, and his claims of Rafsanjani activism are shared by others.  His assessment of Rafsanjani as the sole counterweight to the Supreme Leader, however, seems exaggerated.  End summary  2.(S/NF) An engineering professor from Sharif University shared February 26 his assessment of the current situation in Iran. Although clearly pro-Rafsanjani, he was not particularly politically active, although he came from a prominent family. His views seemed to have been shaped by three important factors.  He is reportedly related by marriage to Rafsanjani and has met him on a number of occasions.  He is from a reportedly prominent bazaari family, although he says he clashes with his father's traditionalist views.  And his years spent studying in the US and UK appeared have allowed him to understand the Western perspective on Iran and given him some fairly pro-Western views.  (For instance, he said his non-objection to his daughter studying abroad is relatively rare in Iran.)  He repeatedly made clear his views were his own and that he did not have first-hand access to information, although he mentioned he and his family go to Rafsanjani's house once a year or every other year to pay respects.  He also claimed that his father is one of chief informal advisors to the regime on commercial matters and as such serves as the principal liaison between the bazaaris and the government.  (Note: this assertion has not been independently confirmed. Endnote)  His father was reportedly imprisoned and tortured by the Shah, accused of funding Islamists against the government, and held several years in Evin prison.  He later held a high level position at the Ministry of Ershad when Khatami was minister.  Ahmadinejad: a bad manager --------------------------  3.(S/NF) The professor said his traditionalist father supports President Ahmadinejad because he thinks he is honest, but the son disagrees and is very critical of the president's performance.  In the professor's view, the Iranian government's worst enemy is its bad management.  Anyone qualified has left public service or been fired.  He also claimed most bazaaris have turned against Ahmadinejad because of his economic mismanagement of the country, a view echoed by other contacts. Another contact claimed that the bazaaris are actively trying to undermine Ahmadinejad by creating artificial shortages of goods to increase pressure on the government.  A different contact claimed Rafsanjani is directing such meddling.  4.(S/NF) After a year and a half in office, Ahmadinejad has also alienated wider swaths of the population by not keeping his economic promises, the professor said.  In a separate conversation, an Iranian economist said that that the roughly 30 percent of the population who either a) directly benefited from oil dollars in the past; or b) were staunch conservatives in support of Ahmadinejad are turning against him as their pockets become lighter.  Another contact commented that Ahmadinejad's weakness is that his major economic priority from the beginning was redistribution of wealth, not economic development, but in any case has failed in his efforts.  Private sector complaints -------------------------  5.(S/NF) The professor, who also owns a publishing company, said he has had to lay off 20 employees since the economy started plummeting.  Other business contacts have also said they've been forced to lay off large numbers of employees.  The professor echoed others' comments that they are unsure how to make decisions regarding their privately owned businesses in light of undefined possible sanctions coming down the pike.  Lessons learned?  RPO DUBAI 00000009  002.2 OF 003   ----------------  6.(S/NF) In a view shared by many of our contacts, the professor believes Ahmadinejad's win resulted from two factors: 1) an order from the Supreme Leader to the head of IRGC to use IRGC and Basij to mobilize votes for him; and 2) votes from uneducated people who believed his promises of economic support.  One source claimed that the Supreme Leader thought that Ahmadinejad would be a humble, pliable man of the people and was surprised by his antagonistic posturing.  He heard that in the December 2006 elections, the Supreme Leader instructed IRGC not to work against Rafsanjani.  He is also hearing that large portions of the IRGC and Basij no longer support Ahmadinejad, a view shared by some other contacts.  The professor said the silver lining may be that this election will act as a maturing experience for the Iranian electorate, who will learn from the "worst mistake they have ever made."  Rafsanjani moves to counter the president -----------------------------------------  7.(S/NF) The professor said he thought one of Rafsanjani's most significant recent statements was his speech for anniversary of the revolution, in which he claimed to have advised Ayatollah Khomeini that then President Bani-Sadr was not the right person for the job, prior to Bani-Sadr's ouster.  The professor said this comment was believed to have been a veiled threat that he could do the same with Ahmadinejad.  8.(S/NF) The professor claimed that Rafsanjani has a good relationship with the grand ayatollahs and has persuaded them not to meet Ahmadinejad.  He claimed the grand ayatollahs are generally suspicious that Ahmadinejad is dragging the country into conflict and specifically peeved that the president took it upon himself to write a letter to the Pope.  Another source also mentioned that the grand ayatollahs are shunning the president, but for the more selfish reason in that they believe he is jeopardizing their interests.  His view of Rafsanjani ----------------------  9.(S/NF) The professor asserted that Rafsanjani genuinely cares about Iran, wants a better relationship with West, and can make it happen.  He called him the only counterweight to the Supreme Leader in Iranian politics.  Without indicating how many times he has met Rafsanjani, he indicated at least several occasions of family gatherings.  He described the Expediency Chair as honest in his politics, though he quickly qualified that perhaps he is less honest in other ways, alluding to the rampant rumors of corruption.  He said Rafsanjani is very intelligent, with an IQ of 170.  He also said he has the knack of remembering details about people.  The first time he met him, he said, they discussed the Internet.  When they met again years later, Rafsanjani recalled the conversation.  10.(S/NF) The professor said Rafsanjani made a lot of mistakes as president, although he claimed he was the only person who would give the Supreme Leader realistic assessments of the situation during the Iran-Iraq war.  The professor felt that then President Khatami and the reformers made a mistake by humiliating Rafsanjani instead of bringing him onboard to help them fight their battles.  He said Rafsanjani's two electoral humiliations sent him into a state of depression but that his landslide win in December had reenergized him.  When asked about the rumor that the Supreme Leader may be replaced by a council, he didn't answer, simply saying Rafsanjani has the ability to energize any institution with which he is associated.  Differing views of Supreme Leader's current take on Ahmadinejad --------------------------------------------- ------------------  11.(S/NF) The professor believes that unlike Rafsanjani, the Supreme Leader changes his opinion frequently, according to whoever gets his ear.  The professor believes the Supreme Leader dropped support for Ahmadinejad briefly in the time around the December election but has given him back his support in the past few weeks.  He argued that although the leader knows he made a mistake by bringing Ahmadinejad in, cutting him loose will undermine the leader's authority.  On the other hand, a Tehran-based businessman disputed this assessment and said he did not think Ahmadinejad had returned to the leader's good graces, citing his absence at several recent meetings the leader  RPO DUBAI 00000009  003.2 OF 003   had with cabinet members.  US-Iran relations -----------------  12.(S/NF) Regarding relations with the US, the professor understood the US need to forcefully counteract Iranian aggression in Iraq, but he thought it was necessary to find a way for the two countries to talk.  He was very worried that the countries were drifting into war, predicting disastrous results.  He said there was little understanding of the US position on the nuclear issue inside Iran because of the spin the regime puts on the news.  Specifically, he said there was little knowledge of what P5-1 is offering Iran, little understanding of the US position on civilian energy, and little recognition of the symbolic importance of the offer that Secretary Rice would conduct the negotiations herself.  13.(S/NF) He maintained that the US now sees itself as a father figure in the world, and it should therefore deal with Iran as an errant son, assuring him that acceptance back in the fold is possible, rather than like someone who will always be an outsider.  He said acts of "kindness" go a long way and applauded efforts such as the recent travel to Iran by the US wresting team.  He believed that President Bush should offer a meeting with no preconditions, but only with the Supreme Leader or Rafsanjani.  There would be enormous pressure from Iran to accept.  The leader would likely refuse, but Rafsanjani would find a way to do it.  14.(S/NF) Comment:  While his statements to a US official may have been colored by the fact that his son was applying for a US student visa the next day, he repeatedly stressed that these are simply his views and what he is hearing others say, and didn't claim any firsthand access to knowledge.  Both he and the Iranian-American who introduced him to IRPO Director are clear supporters of Rafsanjani, who they pitch as the key to solving the Iranian problem.  Given our limited access to the Iranian population, it is difficult to assess the general sentiment on Rafsanjani at this time, although Rafsanjani's December election results would seem to indicate significant popularity in Tehran.  Several contacts claim that Rafsanjani is actively working to isolate Ahmadinejad and influence decision-making, in cooperation with Khatami.  On the other hand, calling Rafsanjani the only counterweight to the Supreme Leader seems to run counter to the predominant view of Iranian politics as dominated by multiple spheres of influence.

Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary.  A dual national who in most ways represents the most pro-Western, secular segment of the Iranian population, gave IRPOffs a critical assessment of US strategy on Iran's nuclear program.  He maintained that US arguments against an Iranian enrichment program have not swayed even the elite of Iranian society.  All of Iran, including secularists who dislike the government like him, took two lessons from the Iran-Iraq war, he said.  One, Iran has to be self-reliant in all things. Two, in the one area of WMD, he said, the mullahs have a better track record than the US.  He cited a widely-held view in Iran that the US, along with France and Germany, helped Iraq carry out chemical attacks against Iran during their eight-year war. He said memories from the war are still fresh in Iranians' minds.  He advised the US to proactively engage Iranian elite on the subject and to take the initiative in trying to restore the trust deficit between the two countries.  His recommendation was to find a way to talk to the regime now, rather than risk having to revise US positions later by new facts on the ground.  His comments are particularly noteworthy, given his very pro-Western stance on most other issues, and seemed to epitomize the Iranian nationalist viewpoint about which we hear so much.  End Summary.  Trust deficit ----------------  2.(S/NF) Speaking to IRPoffs February 25, an Iranian-American reformist bemoaned what he perceives as a "trust deficit" between Iran and the US.  The contact, who comes from the most pro-Western, reform-minded segment in Iran, has a good understanding of both Iranian and US perspectives.  In his view, the recent escalation of tensions could have been mitigated had USG officials acknowledged the trust deficit early on and appealed to the elite of Iran.  He did not understand the rationale for not publicizing the contents of the P5-1 package from the outset, saying that doing so could have given fodder to those people advocating talks.  The contents of the package are still not understood in Iran, he said.  A publicized offer by the US to "compensate" Iran in some concrete way while it suspends enrichment could help build trust, he added.  Lessons learned -------------------  3.(S/NF) A portion of the trust deficit, this reformist told us, stems from lessons taken from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.  All Iranians now believe that -- regardless of the fact that such an approach would not be economically rational -- the country should be self-sufficient in all things.  Because of this, US arguments that Iran does not "need" civilian nuclear energy because of its oil and gas reserves are not persuasive and are possibly counter-productive, in his view.  Furthermore, he agreed with what he termed the widespread view in Iran that it is not up to the international community to determine domestic energy policy or energy needs of other countries, and that under international law, Iran has the "right" to pursue nuclear energy.  4.(S/NF) This pro-Western reformer was also dismissive of the argument that the US has advanced to demonstrate that Iran's intentions must be to build nuclear weapons, that the design of Iran's nuclear program does not make economic sense for a purely civilian program.  His reasoning was that outsiders should not assume the worst when looking at the Iranian government's development plans, given all the illogical decision-making apparent in other state-run projects.  He inferred that the Iranian government rarely spends its money efficiently. (Another contact, an economist, recently made the same argument, claiming that Iran had wasted more money in its failed attempt several years ago to become independent in sugar production than it has spent to date on its nuclear industry.)  5.(S/NF) Furthermore, this reformer said, the trust deficit is compounded by Iranian views of US culpability in Iraqi chemical attacks against Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war.  He said in this area (and apparently in this one only) he thinks "the mullahs" have a better track record than the US.  He noted it is "common knowledge" in Iran that the US provided the Iraqi military not only with weapons, but also with satellite imagery depicting "best" targeting opportunities, information the Iraqis then used in their chemical attacks.  He also noted French and  RPO DUBAI 00000010  002.2 OF 002   German responsibility for supplying components for chemical weapons.  It is also widely remembered, he said, that the USG initially accused Iranian forces of what were eventually proven to be Iraqi chemical attacks against the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja.  This reformer claimed that even had Iranian forces had access to chemical weapons, they would not have used them.  He also claimed Iran took greater care in general at avoiding civilian targets than the Iraqis.  6.(S/NF) Echoing Israeli commentary about Ahmadi-Nejad's Iran, the reformer added that there are some in Iran, and apparently not just those in the regime, who view the US as "an existential threat."  He repeated an assertion we here regularly from Iranian interlocutors - that the US would drop all objections to Iran's nuclear program if only it were to shake hands with Israel.  7.(S/NF) The dual national - no fan of Ahmadi-Nejad -- also credited the latter with winning US "acceptance of a civilian nuclear energy program in Iran," and predicted Ahmadinejad would continue to push back on US red-lines on the nuclear issue.  NGO concerns ------------------  7.(S/NF) The dual national was also critical of State Department's classified DRL and MEPI grants for Iran, saying his own work with foreign NGOs had suffered from the increased IRI suspicion these grants had provoked.  He noted that he now had to hide affiliations with outside NGOs, even on non-political projects, to avoid raising government suspicions.  The reformer was also concerned that like other Iranians, he could face future repercussions in Iran for work he did with US NGOs predating the introduction of these new grants.  He said that while he is not allowing his concerns to stop his work on NGO-related projects, he is taking many more extra precautions.  8.(S/NF) Comment:  Some of our interlocutor's arguments are specious or naove -- e.g.,  that the US should not assume Iran's nuclear program has a military component just because it is not designed in a cost-effective way for civilian uses.  Coming as it does from one of the most pro-Western Iranian of our contacts --  that we have failed to sway the elite -- is notable, and we should bear this in mind as we contemplate future public statements.   Judging from the passion with which he presented them, his statements seemed to go to the core views of Iranian nationalism.  At the same time, he is very pro-American -- albeit critical of some aspects of US policy.  9.(S/NF) Comment con't:  We were struck by this contract's degree of high anxiety and agitation on the question of US-Iran relations.  This pro-Western interlocutor's main theme was that the US comes to the Iran equation with a lot of past baggage and Iranians universally (even the Western-oriented) feel they have genuine reasons to question US motives.  Therefore, he argued, the US should focus publicly on the win-win potential of negotiations, underscoring the benefits for average Iranians should solutions be found to the litany of bilateral and international issues that must ultimately be addressed. While we pushed back strongly at the notion that Ahmadi-Nejad had won any concessions from the US (e.g., recognition of Iran's civil nuclear "rights"), our interlocutor appeared to be arguing that the US should decide now what a realistic end scenario is for a mutually acceptable Iranian nuclear program - and be ready to communicate that.  By doing so, he argued, the US will deny regime hardliners the ability to achieve new "facts on the ground" in the nuclear program.  At the same time, those desirous of negotiations could win public support - and put pressure on the regime - for the P5+1 package and the future it holds out to Tehran. BURNS 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000011  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/15/2017 TAGS: ECON, ECIN, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: PRIVITIZATION DEBATE SHARPENS FACTIONAL RIVALRY   RPO DUBAI 00000011  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has been a notional objective of the Iranian government since it implemented its first 5-year economic plan in 1989.  Two significant barriers to privatization have been the strict interpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution by the Iranian government, and private sector anxiety about uncertain outcomes of privatization.  In July 2006, the Supreme Leader issued a decree redefining Article 44 and thereby opening up most government industries to privatization.  Despite the decree, little concrete action to advance privatization efforts followed.  In a speech to state officials on February 19, Ayatollah Khamenei criticized the lack of progress on the privatization front and, according to one economist, openly contradicted key aspects of the president's position on privatization.  Several contacts predict that IRGC controlled-companies will take over the privatized companies and "real" economic growth will only result from creation of new private enterprises.  End Summary.  Privatization efforts 1989-2006 --------------------------------------  2.(C) Privatization has been an agenda item for the Iranian government since its first post-revolutionary economic development plan in 1989.  However, progress has been negligible.  An Iranian economist, speaking to IRPoff, attributed the lack of privatization initiatives to two factors.  Firstly, a strict interpretation up until 2006 of Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution limited the private sector role in the economy and called for government control of major industries. (Note:  Article 44 divides the Iranian economy into three sectors - state, cooperative, and private - and it outlines the size and role of each sector.  Endnote)  Secondly, there has been no push from the private sector because of overall pessimism that privatization would be conducted in a fair, transparent manner.  This pessimism, according to the economist, is compounded by the private sector's inability to help shape government policies.  The Supreme Leader's decree ------------------------------------  3.(C) On July 2, 2006, the Supreme Leader issued an executive order which in effect reinterpreted Article 44 of the Constitution and opened up "most" government sectors to privatization.  The economist suggested that the Supreme Leader stepped up privatization efforts to stimulate the creation of sorely needed employment opportunities and to combat criticism that the Islamic Republic is unable to adapt and change. Efforts are allegedly underway to make the Chamber of Commerce more independent in order to directly address the private sector's  lack of political representation.  The economist also said that political entities affiliated with the business community are on the rise, as well as newspapers devoted to private sector interests, such as Sarmayeh and Etemad. (Comment: To date, IRPoff has seen no evidence of formalized private sector lobbying groups taking root.  Much of the private sector's political activity appears to take place informally. End comment).  4.(C) The Supreme Leader's executive order interpreting Article 44 stipulates that up to 80 percent of the shares of "most" government companies are to be privatized, via the Tehran Stock Exchange.  By March 2010, the government must withdraw fully from all sectors where the private sector is active, unless it receives permission from the parliament.  Private sector participation will be allowed in international trade activities, unless a government monopoly exists.  The companies that are up for 80 percent privatization include: -- all government banks except for the following:  the Central Bank, Bank Melli, Bank of Industry and Mines, the Agriculture Bank, Bank Maskan, Bank Sepah and the Export Development Bank (Note.  Five known banks appear to be up for privatization: Bank Mellat, Post Bank of Iran, Bank Refah, Bank Saderat Iran and Tejarat Bank.  Endnote) -- all insurance companies except for Iranian Central Insurance -- all power provision companies except for the main power transfer networks -- all post and telecommunications companies with the exception of the parent telecommunication network, transfer of frequencies and exchange and distribution of basic mail services. -- all government aviation and shipping organizations, except for the Civil Aviation Organization and the Ports and Shipping  RPO DUBAI 00000011  002.2 OF 002   Organization -- all downstream oil and gas companies -- all other government companies, except for companies where the government has a monopoly (such as the Iran Tobacco Corporation) and companies that have regulatory functions (such as Data Services of Iran).  Recent privatization efforts -------------------------------  5.(C) In an address to public officials February 19, Ayatollah Khamenei indicated that necessary steps to privatize much of Iran's economy have not taken place at a satisfactory pace. Khamenei reportedly attributed the delay to a divergence in government opinions but made it clear that all policymaking should be in line with his July 2006 decree.  The economist viewed the fact that Khamenei's speech came two days prior to elections for the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Mines (ICCIM) as an indication that many of "the top leadership is ready for a new era of interaction with the private sector." Reportedly for the first time, reformists claimed the majority of seats in the ICCIM in the February elections.  (Note: The ICCIM has 40 private sector representatives and 20 government representatives.  Endnote.)  6.(C) The economist noted that the government divergence of opinion referred to by Khamenei is a clash between two distinct groups:  1) those who believe in a 'Chinese style' economic opening which would unleash new economic momentum through private sector investments; and 2) those who want to control all economic activity by passing on economic interests to trusted circles rather than to the real private sector.  He claimed Khamenei and Rafsanjani fall into the first camp, but Ahmadinejad and his supporters - who constitutionally control domestic economic policy - fall into the latter group.  The analyst underscored that Ahmadinejad's priority coming into office was redistribution of wealth, not creation of new economic growth.  He claimed that Khamenei sent a shot across the bow of the president's camp with his statement February 19 that private sector investors are entitled to suitable profits. This runs contrary to Ahmadinejad's reportedly populous approach.  The President, noted one businessman, favors redistribution of 40 percent of private companies to the lower class (known as justice shares) and turning over 40 percent to IRGC cronies.  7.(C) Several business contacts have noted that they "expect" that "privatization" will actually be an opaque process in which state-run companies will be handed over to former IRGC members. The only "real" area for growth, noted one expert, is organic growth of small-to-mid-size entities.  Contacts typically note that although setting up a business can be a cumbersome process in Iran, individuals can make a comfortable living as long as their business does not grow "too much."  Presumably, because growth beyond a certain level turns businesses into prey for rapacious public officials.  8.(C) Comment.  The move toward privatization and a market driven economy could represent a significant change in Iranian economic policy, if properly enacted.  However, if as suspected, sectors of the economy that are "privatized" are only transferred from direct government control to the control of government-affiliated entities, little positive economic impact is expected.  It's safe to assume that we will see growth in semi-private institutions.   Consequently, it is likely that in the short-tem the government's efforts will result in privatization in name but not substance.  At this key juncture, if we conclude that privatization of Iran's major industries and services will create a more open, stable, economy and that such a development could help advance US interests, we should explore means of influencing this internal debate in this direction. Public Diplomacy and civil society programming through MEPI and DRL are possible vehicles. BURNS

Another claimed that the percentage of hardcore conservatives in the IRGC is miniscule, and some are actually pro-American.  A third source, a psychologist,  reportedly teaches anger management to the Basij to help moderate their confrontational approach to the public.  While their assertions cannot be verified, their comments are noteworthy.  These contacts' comments on the current political situation will be reported septel.  End summary  IRGC ----  2.(S/NF) An Iranian who is purportedly a former IRGC general told IRPO Director that recent US actions against Iranians in Baghdad and Irbil had "provoked" the IRGC.  Although it was not clear if he was speaking based on assumption or real knowledge, he said the actions have heightened antagonism within the organization against the US.  On the other hand, the IRGC had long known that the US could take such actions, so they weren't necessarily surprised.  He doubted the US would get any useful information from detainees.  He also doubted there would be retaliation.  He claimed the Supreme Leader had ordered rhetoric about the events to be kept low-key.  3.(S/NF) The former general also said that one of his tasks in the personnel division of the IRGC during the Iran-Iraq war was finding replacements for military personnel killed in action. Through their personnel files, he claimed to have gained a great understanding of IRGC personnel.  He mentioned that in creating the IRGC personnel database, they based their system on the system used by the US military.  4.(S/NF) An Iranian doctor who spent years living in the US and who is now reportedly very close to former Foreign Minister Velayati and a number of other regime officials,  discussed his view of the IRGC.  He maintained that the IRGC has turned against President Ahmadi-Nejad.  He also mentioned that the IRGC-Quds Force reports directly to the Supreme Leader.  Asked his reaction to the US view that the IRGC was a very anti-US, hardline group that supported terrorism, he claimed that only a small percentage, around 3% of IRGC, are as hardline as the paramilitary group, Ansar-e Hizballah.  He said a few are members of both organizations.  Some in the IRGC are pro-US, he claimed.  He said that after the Iran-Iraq war, many IRGC officers went to university and got higher degrees, changing their world views.  He named as an example Soleimani (Note: presumably Brigadier General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the IRGC Qods Force.  Soleimani's classified biography says he did not attend college prior to the Iran-Iraq war and makes no mention of any university education post-war.  Endnote).  5.(S/NF) The former general mentioned that another former IRGC official who now has an Internet ISP company in Iran has been arrested several times for his company's activities.  The source disputed the notion that all IRGC officials and former officials are well connected with regime and favored by it.  He said this is only the case for members of a faction within the IRGC close to the current government (reftel).  Basij -----  6.(S/NF) Both the general and the doctor reportedly have links to the Basij.  The general reportedly knows Basij commander Mohammad Haj Aghamir, and the doctor is reportedly a regular advisor to and a friend of the leader of Tehran Basij.  The general estimated Basij membership at 10-13 million (Note: presumably including non-active duty.  End note).  The doctor said 10 million members, plus their families.  The doctor said Basij doctrine is to support the Supreme Leader and his policies.  The group has no separate agenda and is not seeking to gain power for itself.  He claimed that the Supreme Leader used the Basij to make known his dissatisfaction with the  RPO DUBAI 00000012  002.2 OF 002   president (NFI) and that the Basij stopped supporting Ahmadi-Nejad about six months ago.  He claimed the Basij now "hate" Ahmadi-Nejad because the president did not deliver on his promises to them during the election.  The president supposedly promised them a lot of positions in new government but was unable to deliver because he got inundated with similar requests for other groups.  7.(S/NF) The doctor's wife, who was also at the meeting, reportedly teaches anger management to members of the Basij as well as police and guards for the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani.  She has a doctorate in psychology.  Asked what the goal of such training is, she said as an example encouraging Basij to be less aggressive in their dealings with the public, such as confronting improperly dressed women.  She classified the Iranian culture as "angry," in that when Iranians are confronted, their normal response is anger, and said in this way Iranians differ from Americans.  She said she instructs the guards on alternative reactions.  Ansar-e Hizballah -----------------  8.(S/NF) The purported former IRGC general said the Ansar-e Hizballah paramilitary group was very conservative, but also very small.  He put their membership at 3000 members, found only at universities.  He said that Ansar-e Hizballah was established during the Iran-Iraq war by Hussein Allah Karam, who came out of the Basij.  He described Allah Karam as very smart, saying he has a PhD.  The general disputed rumors heard frequently from Iranians that Ansar-e Hizballah deploys foreigners such as Palestinians and Yemenis in their ranks.  9.(S/NF) The doctor said that Ansar-e Hizballah is divided into those willing to use violence and those not.  He also said the group is very conservative, calling them "stupid eggheads."  He put their membership, however, at 200,000 members.  He said the group supports President Ahmadi-Nejad, although they obeyed when the Supreme Leader reportedly told Allah Karam not to interfere in the December 2006 municipal and Assembly of Experts elections.  10.(S/NF) Comment:  These are snippets of interesting information offered by sources who reportedly have a degree of inside information.  These sources were all introduced to IRPO director by the same longstanding Iranian-American contact, making it difficult to independently verify their claims of access to the regime.  None of them were applying for visas, so they had no reason to color their statements in this regard - unlike many of our contacts - but their motivation for meeting with a US official remains unclear.  Their assessment that the IRGC contains various political groupings is in line with comments from other contacts, who have maintained the IRGC contains factions favoring one politician - Ahmadi-Nejad, Qalibaf, Rafsanjani, etc, - over another.  The doctor's claim that the IRGC as a whole is now anti-Ahmadi-Nejad and that the Basij "hate" him may have been based on political motivation. The doctor, who reportedly served on the presidential campaign of Velayati, remains an avid supporter, and claims Velayati is planning a 2009 bid.  He may have been deliberating exaggerating the situation to color USG's assessment of Ahmadi-Nejad's political standing in Iran.  11.(C) Comment con't:  On a related note, a different, very westernized Iranian contact who lives outside Iran - not apparently connected to any of these groups - advised the USG to moderate the "vilification" of the IRGC and the Basij, which he said was found in VOA broadcasting.  Given the size of these two organizations, he said, a large percentage of the Iranian population has an IRGC or Basij member in the family.  Making sweeping generalities about these organizations has the potential of turning this extended group against the US, he said, by making them worry that in the case of change in Iran, their family members would be targeted.  He implied that the focus of US criticisms should be on specific objectionable behaviors of these groups, not on the groups themselves.  This is not an issue we have raised with other contacts but can do so in the future in order to gauge reaction. BURNS

Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  In a conversation that predated passage of UNSCR 1747, an Iranian doctor with reportedly close connections to conservative circles discussed Iran's nuclear issue and the domestic political situation.  He predicted Iran would eventually cave to international pressure and suspend enrichment, but he clearly felt Iran was entitled to nuclear weapons to protect itself from a perceived nuclear threat from Israel.  The principal focus of his political remarks was extolling the positive influence of former Foreign Minister Velayati, who he maintained wanted to build bridges with the West.  While he did not in any way seek a "channel" between Velayati and the US, at one point he solicited USG financial backing for Velayati's next campaign run, a subject IRPO did not pursue.  We hear multiple views concerning who has the ear of the Supreme Leader, so this report should not be considered definitive by any means, but the source offered some noteworthy views regarding politics in Iran.  End summary  2.(S/NF) An Iranian doctor reportedly well connected to conservative circles discussed Iran's nuclear dilemma and domestic politics with IRPO Director in mid-March.  (He called the Supreme Leader a former patient but said he could not help his undefined problem with his arm, and said his current patients include the Supreme Leader's son and the governor of the province of Tehran, but did not say for what.)  He discussed a number of issues, including the nuclear issue, domestic politics, IRGC, Basij, and Ansar-e Hizballah (reftel).  His views on regional politics, as well as on drug abuse in Iran (he also runs a drug addiction clinic), will be reported septel.  His view: Iran will accept suspension -------------------------------------  3.(S/NF) In a conversation prior to passage of UNSCR 1747, the doctor predicted Iran will accept the enrichment suspension requirement (no time frame given), because pressure from sanctions will leave it no choice.  Nonetheless, he was very critical of what he saw as the US acting as the "arbitrator" of who can have nuclear technology and who cannot.  It was clear he believed that Iran's goal was to build nuclear weapons.  Given that he claimed "all" Iranians believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against Iran as a first strike, he appeared to feel Iran was justified in arming itself.  4.(S/NF) What troubled the doctor most was the notion that President Ahmadi-Nejad -- whom he does not support -- would reap the political benefits from any subsequent improvement of relations with the West should Iran suspend enrichment and enter into negotiations.  Rehashing the old argument from Iranians over who gets credit for any rapprochement with the US, he claimed Ahmadi-Nejad's principal goal at this point is to get reelected in 2009 and that he needed to do something to reverse his sinking popularity.  5.(S/NF) In contrast to the doctor's views, several other sources seemed to think Iran would need more incentives to suspend.  One source suggested allowing Iran to ask for a reciprocal precondition for talks, such as US first unfreezing Iran's assets.  Another source suggested Iranians could announce they have reached a percentage of enrichment which would be "acceptable" to West, then say they are stopping activity because their factories are "not ready."  Another claimed that Iran would trust the UK more than it would trust Russia to do enrichment for them.  His view: Velayati for president --------------------------------  6.(S/NF) The doctor acknowledged, however, that the call on whether or not to suspend enrichment was not the president's, but ultimately the Supreme Leader's.  He further claimed that Ali Velayati, foreign minister under President Rafsanjani, was the most influential voice on the Supreme Leader's foreign policy committee.  (Note: this is a reference to the Strategic Council for Foreign Relations, created by the Supreme Leader in June 2006 to act as an advisory panel on foreign relations.  It is not clear how influential this body has been in foreign policy decision-making.  Endnote)  The doctor maintained that  RPO DUBAI 00000014  002.2 OF 003   Ahmadi-Nejad has no voice on this committee.  7.(S/NF) The doctor, clearly a fan of Velayati, reportedly served on former FM Velayati's failed 2005 presidential campaign.  He said Velayati plans to run again in 2009, and he plans to join his campaign again.  The doctor claimed Velayati's star is rising in Iran, along with Tehran Mayor Qalibaf.  He thought Velayati made a mistake in pulling out of the 2005 election.  8.(S/NF) He claimed that Rafsanjani will not run for president again in 2009 and has already lent his support to Velayati.  He maintained that Velayati had the confidence of both the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani and that the Supreme Leader knew that any advice from Velayati already had Rafsanjani's support.  The doctor said that Velayati shares foreign policy goals with Rafsanjani and that he wants to establish ties with the rest of world.  On the other hand, he indicated differences between the two on domestic policy but did not elaborate.  (Note: He also claimed that Velayati, numerous others in politics today, and himself were members of the Hojjatiyeh prior to the revolution, which he called the "pure" resistance to the Shah.  However, he said both he and Velayati, as well as many others, had since left the group.  Endnote)  Takes money to win an election ------------------------------  9.(S/NF) The doctor accused Ahmadi-Nejad of misusing large amounts of Tehran municipal funds to buy votes during the election, such as $120 "loans" to Basij members.  He also accused current Tehran Mayor Qalibaf of corrupt practices in the election, saying he used money for his campaign that police received (not clear whether legitimately or illegitimately) for resolving problems people had with importing goods into Iran.  10.(S/NF) In what was otherwise a normal conversation with a new contact, at one point the doctor changed tacks and said the US should help pave the way for better relations by playing a role in deciding who wins the 2009 elections.  He said that it will take money to win the elections, and Velayati needs some.  He gave IRPO Director the business card of a company he said was a trading company he set up to raise funds for Velayati's campaign.  He suggested that the US allow this trading company to import goods normally blocked by sanctions to allow Velayati to start compiling funds.  IRPO Director did not pursue the matter.  When asked why Velayati would not have access to Rafsanjani's reported immense wealth if Rafsanjani was backing him, the doctor responded that Rafsanjani was under such scrutiny for corruption these days from Ahmadi-Nejad, who "hated" him, he could not risk it.  The doctor also maintained that the Iranian diaspora did not contribute money for Iranian political campaigns.  His view: Ahmadi-Nejad made many mistakes -----------------------------------------  11.(S/NF) Despite his argument about the importance of financial backing to win the presidency, the doctor underscored the Supreme Leader's role in influencing elections.  He claimed that after Khatami twice won the presidential election, the Supreme Leader decided to ensure future winners had his pre-approval. For this reason, he mobilized the IRGC and the Basij in the 2005 presidential elections, but, said the doctor, the results backfired on him.  Khameini did not realize how much influence others, particularly Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, would have on Ahmadi-Nejad.  The doctor was very critical of Ahmadi-Nejad, who he said made many mistakes in his first six months, including listening to Mesbah-Yazdi.  He said President Ahmadi-Nejad's popularity is now on the decline but that the Supreme Leader will not drop him as president.  Rumor mill ----------  12.(S/NF) Another source, an Iranian-American who travels frequently to Iran, said he heard rumors in Iran that 150 MPs were prepared to impeach Ahmadi-Nejad, but the Supreme Leader told them not to because Khameini knows he is dying.  Another source maintained that the Supreme Leader is worried that if he dies and Ahmadi-Nejad is impeached, the Islamic system will fall.  In the meantime, the Supreme Leader is reportedly trying to select his own replacement.  One source maintained that  RPO DUBAI 00000014  003.2 OF 003   Rafsanjani is proposing former President Khatami, but supposedly only because he knows the Supreme Leader will say no and then maybe consider Rafsanjani.  Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi is reportedly proposing Judiciary chief Shahrudi, while others are advocating replacing the position of supreme leader with a council.  One rumor is that the Supreme Leader is refusing chemotherapy to hide visible signs of his illness.  (Note:  It is important to note how rumor-prone Iran is.  End note)  13.(S/NF) Comment:  Another contact, a purported former IRGC general, was dismissive of Velayati's influence on foreign policy and claimed that Hassan Rohani, formerly Iran's top nuclear negotiator and now the Supreme Leader's representative on the Supreme National Security Council, has a stronger voice. We often hear different prognoses from different Iranians as to who is the ascendant power.  Some Iranians have predicted that Qalibaf or Larijani will be the next president; this is the first time we have heard the prediction for Velayati.  We would also note that while we frequently hear claims that Rafsanjani is a pragmatist seeking closer ties with the West, we hear this less said about Velayati.  In any case, all Iranian prominent figures seem to be towing the party line in statements surrounding passage of UNSCR 1747, with none right now arguing for rapprochement over enrichment.  Velayati called the UNSC's intervention in Iran's nuclear case illegal and said that Iran will not suspend uranium enrichment even for a short period of time.  He said that putting up with international pressure was the high price the country was to pay for materializing great projects such as development of nuclear energy.  He called access to the nuclear fuel cycle the redline of the ruling system on the nuclear issue.  "Iran will not withdraw from this redline but will rather use various political, international and economic levers to reduce the inevitable cost," he added.  We were surprised by the request for USG funding for Velayati, and it discredited the contact to a degree, although the rest of his comments seemed genuine.  The goal of such an inquiry may have been just to test the reaction, or it may have demonstrated our interlocutor's ignorance of US policy, despite having lived in the US 15 years.  It may also have been simply an attempt at personal gain. BURNS

RPO DUBAI 00000015  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  Despite the unpopularity of cutting subsidies at a time of high inflation, the parliament has set May 22 as the date to raise gasoline prices by 25 percent.  Parliament also put an annual cap on gasoline subsidies of USD 2.5 billion. Judging from Iranian press, general Iranian opinion toward the measure appears generally negative, with some economists forecasting "massive shockwaves" and others simply predicting increased corruption in the energy sector.  Some details of the plan are still unclear.  Contacts reported that there has been limited distribution of "smart cards" - although wide-scale rationing through fuel cards does not seem to be on the table at this time.  It will be interesting to gauge public reaction when the increase takes effect.  Reducing gasoline subsidies is a positive step for Iran's macro-economic health, but it appears to fly in the face of President Ahmadi-Nejad's populist promises of redistributing oil wealth.  It also comes at a time when Iran is likely looking to shore up domestic support for its nuclear policies in the face of international pressure through UNSC resolutions.  However, the Iranian government may be moving now to address a structural weakness in its economy and reduce its dependence on other countries in order to lessen the impact of any future gasoline embargo on the country.  End Summary.  2.(C) Fixed pump prices for the last three years boosted Iranian gasoline consumption well beyond domestic refining capabilities - forcing the government to import 40 percent of its gasoline needs.  Environmentalists bemoan the impact of this high consumption, including leaded gasoline, while Iranian parliamentarians bemoan the impact that subsidies have on the federal budget.  The Majles threatened to implement a fuel coupon system and/or to decrease gasoline subsidies last year, but until recently appeared reluctant to touch gasoline, as inexpensive fuel is widely viewed as an entitlement in the world's fourth oil producer.  However, in early March, in a time of heightened discontent with the economy and in direct contradiction to Ahmadi-Nejad's promised populist spending, the Majles passed legislation limiting Iranian gas subsidies and raising fuel costs at the pump.  Growing pressure --------------------  3.(C) Riding high on popular support for his campaign promises to bring the country's oil wealth to the people's tables, President Ahmadi-Nejad ignored former President Khatami's counsel to him to invest in industry, particularly energy sector infrastructure.  He also failed to react seriously to a June 2006 letter by 50 economists on the worrisome state of Iran's economy.  His  policy of placating the people with populist spending appeared to falter when some of his unfulfilled promises started eroding his popularity.  At the same time, his overspending sparked criticism from academics and elites, in the run-up to the December 2006 municipal elections.  Since December, public debate on Ahmadi-Nejad's economic mismanagement has dominated news sources and the minds of many Iranians. (Note: An overview of the state of the Iranian economy to be reported septel. Endnote.)  Hard decision by the Majles ---------------------------------  4.(C) In this time of public discontent with the state of the economy, the Majles passed a very unpopular two-part bill:  1) placing a USD 2.5 billion annual cap on gasoline subsidies; and 2) increasing gasoline prices, which are set by the government, from roughly 8 cents to 11 cents a liter.  The changes are to go into effect May 22.  (Note:  The Majles has postponed action on this unpopular issue before, it could do so again.  Endnote) There is discussion of further price increases after subsidies are used up, but no clarity as to how much.  In addition to curbing fuel subsidies, the Majles has also discussed rationing .  In the run-up to the Majles decision to curb subsidies, the idea of utilizing "smart" fuel ration cards, possibly with a two-tiered pricing schedule, was debated by decision makers and in the media.  Some contacts reported in January that the government was beginning to hand out ration cards, although it does not appear that legislation regarding ration cards has been passed.  The current thinking on utilizing such cards in conjunction with the subsidies is unknown.  RPO DUBAI 00000015  002.2 OF 002    New bill:  insufficient or overly ambitious? ------------------------------------  5.(C) Public reaction to subsidy caps and price increases, albeit consistently pessimistic, runs the spectrum from believing the measures to be insufficient to perceiving them as overly ambitious.  According to a March 8 Financial Times article, Majles deputy Mahmoud Abtahi warned that a 25 percent hike in pump prices would cause a "severe shock because petrol is the life blood of the economy."  Abtahi urged parliament to help off-set the financial hit to low-income groups.  The same article cited Iran Economics editor Heydar Pourian as saying that a 25 percent price increase was "psychologically bearable and not much above inflation."  Business newspaper Sarmayeh carried an editorial March 8 indicating that the subsidy cap was a good first step, but not enough.  It argued that the problem facing Iran is two-fold, low-prices and high consumption, and that the bill only addresses the former.  An  economist contact predicted to IRPOff that any increase in gas prices, particularly any form of rationing or two-tier pricing, will result in greater corruption in the energy sector, similar to "the last time the government tried rationing."  (Note:  A rationing system used during the Iran-Iraq war was reportedly heavily exploited by those with close government ties.  Endnote)   6.(C) Comment:  The Majles is finally taking difficult steps that will provide long-term economic benefits to combat Iranian economic mismanagement and end the substantial drain on foreign reserves caused by the gasoline subsidy.  This is a positive step in economic terms, whatever the motivation.  The driving factor for taking such an unpopular measure at this sensitive time, however, may be to insulate the country from a possible US or UN gasoline boycott for Iran, given that the idea has already circulated in the media and in the US Congress.  Iran can reduce its vulnerability to such a future step by reducing gasoline imports now, while at the same time reducing  Iran's dependence on foreign countries, long a foreign policy priority.  As part of this policy, it is also planning to bring new refineries on-line, but of course, this is a longer-term solution.  As long as US policy remains to try to target the impact of sanctions on the Iranian government and not the Iranian people, a gasoline boycott is probably not a good option.  While it would have a significant impact on Iran, it is difficult to gauge its impact on popular opinion and may have the reverse impact as the one we desire.  Although it is difficult to generalize, a rise in gasoline prices by the Iranian government could increase its unpopularity in the minds of the Iranian people; a rise in gasoline prices triggered by a foreign-imposed boycott could boost solidarity with the government.  IRPO will continue to monitor both public reaction to and implementation of the new gasoline policy. BURNS

While the doctor says it was a mistake for Iran to fund terrorist groups, he maintains it cannot abandon them now or risk losing honor.  The general says Iran can do a lot more to monitor the Iran-Iraq border and that US and Iran can come to terms on Iraq prior to reaching a broader resolution of issues.  End summary  2.(S/NF) A purported former IRGC general and an Iranian doctor who is reportedly very close to conservative circles in Iran, discussed Iran's external affairs.  Both were introduced to IRPO Director in separate meetings by a longstanding Iranian-American contact.  Their comments on the IRGC, the Basij, and Ansar-e Hizballah, as well as the nuclear and domestic situation are reported in reftels.  US-Iran relations -----------------  3.(S/NF) The doctor said he does not see US-Iran conflict as inevitable and can envision friendly negotiations in mutual respect with the US, but he does not think complete resolution of all issues possible, saying both sides would need to agree to differ on some issues.  That said, he claimed Iran's relations with the US would improve if the US reduced its support for Israel.  The doctor claimed Iran is "begging" for relations with the US, but individuals within the government are wary of advocating such steps, afraid of getting burned.  He claimed that 70% of Iranians openly support relations with the US and a further 20% want relations but are too nervous to admit it publicly.  In his view, Iran is better off dealing with the US than with Syria, because Iranians "can't trust Syrians," saying they break their word.  Israel ------  4.(S/NF) The doctor maintained that "all" Iranians believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against them in a first strike.  (His views on the Iranian nuclear issue are reported in ref B.)  When asked why not try to resolve the bilateral issues between Iran and Israel, he replied that while he can envision negotiations with the US, negotiations with Israel are "inconceivable."  5.(S/NF) The doctor also repeated a frequently heard claim that the Israeli government currently has influence within the Iranian government.  He accused Israel of deliberately creating discord within the IRIG, to "divide and conquer."  For instance, he said, when high levels make a decision, but lower levels of government interfere with implementation, that's the work of the Israelis.  The doctor maintained, without explaining, that President Ahmadi-Nejad's motivation for staging the conference on the Holocaust was to counter Israeli influence inside the Iranian government.  6.(S/NF) The former general, when asked about the issues between Iran and Israel, cited Iran's historically good relations with Jews, claiming it was instead Arabs and Jews who were always in conflict.  He maintained that the onus was now on Israel to build trust about its long-term intentions.  Iranians believe that Israel wants to expand its territory from the Nile in Egypt to the Furat river in Iraq, he claimed.  7.(S/NF) When asked about the source of antagonism with Israel, the general said there were a few issues that penetrated the revolution that were not "natural."  He blamed the influence of Palestinians who prior to the revolution trained Iranian revolutionary fighters in Lebanon.  After seizing power, those Iranians were sympathetic to Palestinians, he said.  Some of  RPO DUBAI 00000016  002.2 OF 003   these Palestinian protigis went on to establish the IRGC. Iranians later broke with the PLO when Arafat supported Saddam Hussein, but he claimed that sympathy for Palestinians endured within this group.  (He also said the same thing happened with communists in Iran.  Communists took part in the revolution but were later "killed off."  Nonetheless, Marxist economic thinking prevailed, resulting in an economy that is "70%" state controlled.)  Support for terrorist groups ----------------------------  8.(S/NF) One of the issues the doctor felt could not be resolved initially in any negotiations with the US would be Iran's support for Hizballah.  He said Iran cannot withdraw support for groups like Hizballah and Hamas, a matter of honor.  Firstly, Iran sees itself as the champion for Shia, and secondly, links to such groups gives Iran a role in the region.  He said Iranian support for Hizballah is partially a response to current realities, but partially a future investment in case Israel tries again to occupy Lebanese territory.  That said, he accepted that Hizballah's pretext of Shebaa Farms as a justification for fighting Israel was weak.  9.(S/NF) The doctor freely admitted that Iranians do not like the fact that Iran sends money to Palestinian groups.  He claimed that 95% Iranians don't care about Palestinians and said Arafat was called a "prostitute" in Iran.  In his view, funding these groups (Note: it was not clear if he was including Hizballah.  Endnote) was a mistake from the beginning, but he maintained it would be too costly in terms of honor for Iran to abandon them now.  He drew a parallel to the American situation in Iraq, claiming that the US now "knows" that invading Iraq was a mistake but believes the costs of walking away would be too high.  Sunni extremism ---------------  10.(S/NF) The general called Sunni extremism Iran's biggest enemy.  The doctor claimed Sunni extremists hate Shia more than they hate the US and said Al-Qaida had burned Iran.   Although the doctor did not clarify whether he was speaking with any degree of knowledge, he said that after Iran had treated Al-Qaida with a degree of tolerance, allowing passage and treating those under house arrest well, Al-Qaida paid back Iran with its statements against Shia.  Iraq ----  11.(S/NF) The doctor maintained that Iran "has to be" present in Iraq to support Shia as a matter of honor.  He claimed that "80%" of Iranian activities in Iraq are not related to violence.  Furthermore, he said, it is not in Iran's interest to end up in conflict with the US there.  12.(S/NF) The general claimed to know the Iran-Iraq border well from his war experience and said Iran can do a lot more to monitor the border.  In his opinion, US and Iran can come to an agreement on Iraq issues prior to resolving bilateral issues, but that discussions behind the scenes between intelligence agencies were more important than diplomatic meetings.  Regional relations ------------------  13.(S/NF) The former general repeated the claim often heard from Iranians that Persian Gulf countries are not actually afraid of Iran, that these countries lie to the US to get US assistance. When asked about Saudi concerns that Iran may try to stir up unrest in the Saudi Shia population, he dismissed the notion and instead accused Saudi religious elements of working with Pakistani intelligence to stir up the Baloch population.  14.(S/NF) When asked about March 5, 2007 Sunday Telegraph story in which a former Iranian consul general to Dubai claimed to disclose intelligence activities of the consulate and contingency plans for attacks in Dubai in case of Israeli or US attacks, he said he had no knowledge of the claims.  He said only that he would not be surprised if Hizballah is funded from Dubai.  He maintained that "all" such groups have some kind of  RPO DUBAI 00000016  003.2 OF 003   presence here and claimed that Usama bin Ladin owns a shopping center in Dubai.  In any case, he doubted Iran would order attacks in Dubai, given the role it plays as Iran's economic window to the world. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary: Iranian women's rights activists are emerging as the country's most assertive dissident force, eclipsing most other key pro-reform constituencies in Iran. During the Khatami presidency from 1997-2005, students and journalists constituted the leading edge of reform and political activism.  With some exceptions, women adopted quieter tactics during that time to promote change in the Iranian legal system's treatment of women.  Since early 2006, however, women's rights activists in Iran have become increasingly vocal and visible, resisting the new administration's efforts to stymie the voice of civil society. These women have a clear and specific agenda -- legal reform to end laws that they consider discriminatory to women.  Their efforts are now at the forefront of the reform movement in Iran, and they are bearing the brunt of the Iranian government's efforts to contain civil society. End summary.  Recent history of women's rights in Iran ----------------------------------------  2.(SBU) The fate of the women's rights movement in Iran is currently at the forefront of civil society in Iran in general. Under President Khatami, the women's movement scored an important victory.  Following months of efforts, the reformist sixth Majles approved the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on June 23, 2003.  However, the conservative Guardian Council vetoed adoption of CEDAW, saying it violated both Iranian and Islamic law.  3.(SBU) Since August 2005, the Ahmadi-Nejad administration, which fears that an active civil society will produce a "velvet revolution" in Iran, has cracked down strongly on intellectuals, scholars, journalists, and non-governmental organizations inside the country.  The crackdown gained steam with the April 2006 arrest of prominent intellectual Ramin Jahanbegloo, following his travel to the US and other countries for academic conferences and research.  4.(SBU) The government's efforts, however, have not stifled activism on the part of women's groups, although these activists have also suffered harassment, travel bans, and arrests as a result.  Though many activists continued their efforts, relatively little was heard about the women's rights movement in Iran until early 2006.  On March 8, 2006, security forces disrupted a rally to celebrate International Women's Day in Tehran.  They used force to disperse demonstrators, bringing greater international attention to the women's rights movement in Iran.  Women's rights activists later organized a demonstration on June 12 in Tehran to call for reform of the Iranian legal system.  Again, security forces forcibly disrupted the June demonstration and arrested several demonstrators.  The women were protesting laws that state, for example, that a woman's life and her court testimony are worth half that of a man's, and that married women cannot obtain divorces, custody of their children after the age of seven, or travel outside the country without their husband's permission.  Iranian law also states that death by stoning is the appropriate punishment for adultery.  5.(SBU) Women's groups are also increasingly using petitions as a method to protest and draw international attention to key women's rights issues. In late 2006, women's groups in Iran began a petition calling for an end to the practice of stoning, and other petitions protesting specific cases of stoning convictions were also circulated. A petition campaign entitled "One Million Signatures Demanding Changes to Discriminatory Laws" was also launched in August 2006.  Campaigners intend to go door-to-door to obtain the referenced million signatures for their petition.  One benefit of this tactic, campaigners say, is that it will increase awareness among Iranian women about their legal status, even if some women do not sign the petition.  The women's rights movement in 2007 -----------------------------------  6.(C) Five women's rights activists -- Nooshin Ahmadi Khorasani, Parvin Ardalan, Shahla Entesari, Sussan Tahmasebi (who also holds US citizenship), and Fariba Davoodi Mohajer -- were later put on trial for organizing the June 2006 demonstration. The five women are also organizing members of the "One Million Signatures" campaign.  They are charged with "acting against national security."  (Note: Fariba Davoodi Mohajer was in the US at the time of the court date and thus escaped arrest. Endnote) Their trial date was set for March 4, 2007, only four days,  RPO DUBAI 00000017  002.2 OF 002   before International Women's Day.  Many observers speculated that the trial date was chosen deliberately to deter another rally.  Women's groups organized a rally in 2007 nonetheless, which was mired with similar violence against demonstrators.  7.(U) On the day of the trial, women's groups held a demonstration outside of the courthouse, to show solidarity with the women on trial.  Police used force to disperse demonstrators and arrested several of them.  When the women being tried protested the treatment of the demonstrators, they too were arrested. Khorasani, Ardalan, Entesari, and Tahmasebi were taken to Evin prison, along with 29 arrested demonstrators; a total of 33 arrested.  Domestic press reports indicate that 30 of the women were detained for less than a week, and then released. Authorities held three prominent activists -- Shadi Sadr, Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh, and Jila Baniyaghoub -- until the final days of the Iranian year 1385, which ended March 21, 2007.  Travel bans and NGO closures ----------------------------  8. (SBU) On January 26, 15 women journalists were detained by authorities as they attempted to travel to India for an educational workshop on journalism.  Three of the women were taken to Evin prison and held for 24 hours, and are reported to be facing trial in April on charges of "acting against national security" by planning to participate in the journalism workshop.  The women were reportedly interrogated about their possible connections with organizations that have received foreign funding.  9. (U) In late March, three prominent NGOs -- Iran CSOs Training and Research Center (ICTRC), Raahi Legal Center, and Non-Governmental Organizations Training Center -- were shut down by the government.  The latter two NGOs were founded by Shadi Sadr and Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh respectively, two of the activists arrested March 4.  10.(C) Comment: The government's paranoia of a velvet revolution orchestrated by the West is part of its motivation for pressuring civil society in Iran, including the women's movement.  Another motivation is clashes on religious grounds between the conservative government and the more liberal women's movement, as evidenced by Ahmadi-Nejad's immediate step to reorient the women's affairs office established by Khatami to a family issues office. The government's efforts to silence this movement are also consistent with an overall strategy of increasing "unity and solidarity" among the public (i.e. suppressing dissent) in the face of increasing international pressure over its nuclear program.  11.(C) Comment cont'd: It is also worth noting that in contrast to most other countries in the region, women in Iran are not fighting for rights they have never had.  Rather, they are fighting in part to regain rights they enjoyed prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is unclear how significant of a constituency the arrested women represent; while anecdotal reports suggest that dissatisfaction with the Islamic Republic's policies on women's issues is widespread, only a very small percentage of Iranian women have actively engaged in efforts to confront the government.  However, even if they represent only a small elite, the women's activists currently under fire in Iran could play a critical role in mobilizing a more assertive reform movement in Iran through their linkages with other reform actors and the broad societal sympathy toward their aims.

CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary.  A long-time contact believes it is in the current Iranian government's interest to start a military skirmish with the West to allow the government to exert far greater control over civil society, distract attention from economic woes, and silence Expediency Council head Rafsanjani. He believed the government was using the stand-off with the UK over the detained British sailors for this purpose.  He also claimed that the Iranian government was restricting the spectrum of political views within policymaking circles.  Many sides seem increasingly nervous about the danger of an accident sparking escalation.  End summary  2.(S) A long-time contact, a Dubai-based business man who travels frequently to Tehran and claims to interact with a wide swath of influential individuals inside Iran, claimed that it is in the current Iranian government's interest to fuel a military confrontation with the West.  A view shared by a number of IRPO interlocutors, he said that such a confrontation would allow the Iranian government to control civil society to the extent seen immediately following the 1979 revolution.  A military row would also distract domestic focus away from current economic difficulties and unite the people, said the businessman. Furthermore, such a clash would silence criticism from Expediency Council head Rafsanjani.  3.(S) Along these lines, the contact saw the March 23 detention of the British sailors/marines as a deliberate attempt to push the West into greater conflict.  He also believed the Iranians sought out British for this operation as a less risky stand-in for Americans, fearing a harsher reaction from the US.  4.(S) The contact also thought that breadth of viewpoints available to policymakers in Iran was constricting.  For instance, he claimed that the type of political analyst who could understand the implication of an offer from Secretary Rice to sit at the negotiation table with Iranians has been sidelined in recent months.  He cited as an example a long-time friend and geo-political expert (unnamed) who previously taught geo-political courses for the IRGC and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  After attending a (presumably Track II) meeting with Americans in Greece nine months ago, the expert was reportedly "harassed," and his career began a slow descent.  He is now an advisor at a state oil company and wants no involvement in politics.  5.(S) Comment.  The idea that hardliners in Iran are seeking greater tensions to silence critics, unite the population, and divert attention away from economic and civil society concerns has been reported to IRPoffs by other contacts.  While it is difficult to discern the truth of the claim, it certainly appears Iran is using its seizure of the British sailors to prove its "toughness," after facing repeated "humiliations" on the international political front.  On the other hand, it is likely that Iranians thought targeting British rather than Americans would temper the reaction.  In any case, many seem increasingly nervous that a blunder on any side could accidentally spark a quick military escalation.  BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  Iran:  Social Factors Increasing HIV Rates  1.(C) Summary:  The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Iran is accelerating, mostly due to use of intravenous drugs.  Iran's total number of HIV cases has almost doubled in the past two years, and intravenous (IV) drug users account for 63% of the country's total cases.  The highest HIV prevalence rates are among IV drug users in large cities and prisons.  According to one Iranian expert, however, the disease is spreading rapidly and starting to cross over into the general population, apparently linked to increasing sexual promiscuity.  End summary.  Concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemic established among Iran's IV drug users --------------------------------------------- -------------- ----------  2.(C) The HIV epidemic in Iran is accelerating, according to an Iranian infectious disease doctor, who confirmed the country's official and UN published HIV/AIDS data.  The doctor is an AIDS researcher from Iran's primary AIDS Research Center at the University of Tehran, which is partially supported by the office of the Iranian president.  UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS) and the Iranian Ministry of Health estimate that there are 70 thousand HIV/AIDS cases in Iran, although the number of reported cases is under 14 thousand.  HIV prevalence in the general population is still low at 0.1%, but this number is increasing quickly.  Iran's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization confirm that HIV/AIDS cases in Iran have almost doubled in the past two years and that localized epidemics exist among IV drug users.  IV drug use currently accounts for 63% of Iran's total HIV/AIDS cases, sexual transmission accounts for 7.3%, infected blood products 2% and mother to child transmission 0.4%; transmission routes are unknown in about 30% of cases.  HIV prevalence among IV drug users is highest in large cities and prisons; with rates of 23% among IV drug users in Tehran and 25% in Shiraz Prison.  3.(S) The doctor noted that HIV infection rates and incidence in the general population are both on the rise.  According to Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Iran has an estimated 3.7 million drug users, and 137,000 inject drugs. Unofficial estimates for drug use in Iran are as high as 7 million.  Prevalence among IV drug users was about 15% in 2004, mainly among low socioeconomic drug users, but now 25% of the injecting drug users examined are infected.  The doctor, who previously ran the AIDS research center in a major city, said that the highest HIV/AIDS incidences are among IV users in Kermanshah, Fars, Lorestan, and Tehran.   Increase in recreational drug use ---------------------------------  4.(C) According to the Iranian HIV/AIDS expert, one reason for the rise in HIV is a general increase in recreational drug use. Drug use has a long history in Iran and smoking of natural herbs and opiates is traditional in the region, although possession of drugs is forbidden by Iranian law.  Several Iranian visa applicants said that smoking hashish and opium is not taken very seriously in Iran, though injecting hard drugs is looked at quite differently.  Some Iranians claim that some clerics use opium and two recent contacts claimed that Supreme Leader Khamenei, and former Foreign Minister Velayati smoke opium. What was traditionally a social activity for older males is now spreading to females and youth.  At the same time, abuse of other synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamines are also increasing.  5.(U) Narcotics reports say that opium, which is traditionally smoked, has become increasingly expensive in Iran.  Many drug users are attracted by the cheap prices of synthetic and cut opiates such as heroin, which are extremely addictive and cause people to quickly turn to injection where they can get the same affect with a smaller cheaper dose.  According to the Iranian AIDS doctor, a heroin dose is about 2000 tomans or about two dollars.  6.(C) According to two Iranian parents of teenagers, drugs are becoming more accessible for young people, but schools are conducting anti-drug campaigns.  Parents are increasingly watchful of this issue, they said, and try to engage their kids in hobbies.  One mother said she thinks children are becoming  RPO DUBAI 00000019  002.2 OF 002   more defiant as a response to the restrictive lifestyle in Iran.   Shifts in social norms ----------------------  7.(C) At the same time, Iran's culture as a whole is shifting toward greater sexual activity.  Within the sector of drug users, an UNAIDS published behavioral study from 2004 among injecting drug users in a drug treatment center indicated that 41% of the sexually active participants had over six partners, 42% of them had exchanged money for sex, and 50% never used condoms.  In the general population, 70% of the country's population is under the age of 30, divorce rates are increasing, and people are getting married later, if at all.  Such factors are likely to increases the number of sexual partners people have (including prostitutes), increasing the risk of infection. There is also the practice of "sigheh," which allows for temporary marriages with the blessing of a cleric, even for one night, which some say is used at times to skirt the illegality of prostitution.  Some Iranian men who travel in the region reportedly return with HIV and infect their wives, according to several Iranian visa applicants.  In a 2005 study published in Middle East and North Africa's 2006 AIDS Epidemic Update, some 28% of 15-18 year old males in Tehran were sexually active, yet about half of this group had never seen a condom or knew they could prevent STDs, despite the availability of free condoms in health clinics.  They believed HIV could be transmitted by mosquitoes or acquired in swimming pools.  8.(C) Though little is being done in Iran to monitor HIV among prostitutes, the disease is reportedly increasing among Iran's prostitute communities.  According to a study published in the UNAIDS Iran report, one group of women prostitutes in western Tehran had a 6% infection rate.  More people are becoming infected through unsafe sex, specifically through prostitution, according to the Iranian AIDS expert.  She explained that the overlap between injecting drug use and sex for money facilitates the spread of HIV to the general population, as clients of prostitutes spread the disease to their partners.  However, because prostitution is illegal, underground, and stigmatized, it is difficult to survey this group, according to the expert. There is a lack of information on this marginalized group and issues of sex are still too sensitive to address publicly, added the doctor. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    Religiosity Continues Among Iranians -- Modern Iranians Progressive, but not Secular  1.(C) Summary:  In an unscientific survey of 10 Iranians regarding their attitudes toward religion seemed to indicate that, regardless of individual differences, they are connected to their religion.  However, the degree to which they practice their religion differs.  Several Iranian emigrants to the West seemed to be more secular than those still living in Iran and less tied to religious traditions.  According to an Iranian academic, youth in Iran today follow religion more on account of tradition, but he claimed they are generally not deeply spiritual.  He emphasized that Iranians have a high regard for education, which gives them a moderate religious identity, and that more educated people seem to have less trust in mosques. One Iranian businessman opined that Shiite Islam is more open to reform, inferring that in his view, Iran has potential for change and becoming a modern democracy.  Contacts frequently assert that Iran will never become a secular society.  Religion runs deep, despite the disillusion of many with clerical rule, and the disillusion of some clerics with velayat-e faqih.  End summary.  Modern Tehranis connected to religion -------------------------------------  2.(C) According to informal, separate discussions with some 10 different Iranian residents of Tehran passing through Dubai, Iranians consider religion important in life and are deep down religious.  This group of relatively affluent professionals from Tehran included businessmen, a family of wealthy international jewelers, a UK-educated retired military nurse, a lawyer, a retired teacher, a publisher, a young lady photojournalist, and an academic/motivational speaker.  While in no way a scientifically representative sample of the Iranian population, their views of religiosity in Iran are noteworthy.  3.(C) While some considered themselves  Muslim first and others Iranian first, all of these interlocutors said they are religious and not  secular.  The nurse for example, surprised her accompanying Iranian-American friend when she said that even today in Iran, many people follow the mullahs, and that back in the day, the public loved Ayatollah Khomeini.  Several noted that religious practice in Iran is not forced, and that people follow religious traditions of their own volition.  While they did not want religion to be part of all aspects of their everyday lives, they said that the majority of Iranians believe in a protector to save them.  They all seemed respectful of other religions and of their non-Muslim countrymen, considering them harmless.  Religious participation sporadic --------------------------------  4.(C) According to the nurse, all Muslims observe important holidays like Ashura, Iran's most significant Islamic holiday. Many attend mourning rituals, she said, and cry from the bottoms of their hearts in commemoration of Imam Hussein's martyrdom 12 centuries ago.  They claimed virtually every family observes the holy month of Moharam.  (Note:  The ninth and tenth days of Moharam are national holidays in remembrance of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein at the battle of Karbala, the grandson of Prophet Mohammad, son of Ali and his daughter Fatima.  Endnote) Prominent families donate significant amounts of money and food to their mosques during this month.  For example the Iranian jeweler family, an educated and modern business family with regular travels to the West, said they normally sponsors a group of about 2000 Imam Hussein mourners in Tehran.  They slaughter about 100 cows and lambs, hire cooks and run kitchens to feed lunch and dinner to their devout group of men or "dasteh" for the first 13 days of Moharam.  One Iranian, resident in Dubai, said her family in Dubai usually slaughters a cow for Moharam and gives the meat away to the poor.   She explained that people believe disregarding Moharam is a bad omen that could bring misfortune.  On the tenth day, dressed in black, the group proceeds to the streets of Tehran, and the police block roads for their processions.  According to the Iranian religious scholar and several others, occasionally even non-Muslim Iranians like Armenians join the public grieving processions.   RPO DUBAI 00000020  002.2 OF 003   5.(C) On the other hand, the group indicated that not many Tehranis attend Friday prayer services and that many obligations, such as fasting or daily prayers, are largely ignored.  They said that people in Tehran are busy. Furthermore, they said that regular prayers are not really a part of their culture.  Of the two major Islamic holidays, Eid al-Fitr, the feast ending Ramadan fasting, is basically celebrated by those who observe fasting, and Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice after pilgrimage to Mecca, is observed only by families of pilgrims.  Western emigrants less religious --------------------------------  6.(C) In contrast to the Tehranis, several Iranians who have been living in the West considered themselves Iranian before Muslim.  While they may or may not be representative of Iranian expats in the West as a whole, this group focused more on overall spirituality than the practice of Islam.  They asserted that Iranians abroad are probably among the least religious people who have emigrated from an Islamic county.  They referred to the Shia rituals as ancient relics, superstitions, and said they are proud that Islamic customs are not practiced in their homes.  In their view, their nation of Iran is held hostage by mullahs.  One person from this group was going out drinking with his friends on the eve of Ashura.  7.(C) IRPO has  not specifically examined religiosity among the Iranians in Dubai, but we think they fall in a broad range.  The Iranian mosque in Dubai, on the eve of Ashura, was overflowing with young and old Iranians.  The Iranian jeweler family, while held up for their visas in Dubai, catered food for the Iranian mosque in Dubai on this evening.  Religiosity versus spirituality -------------------------------  8.(C) An academic/motivational speaker who lives in Tehran asserted that although Iranians may appear religious in public, many have a superficial sense of religion.  He complained that Iranians in general do not read much or think analytically.  On the other hand, he said Iranians generally have a high regard for advanced education and advised the US to converse and consult with Iranian intellectuals.  He claimed that the importance that Iranians put on education may account for the public's overall moderate religious identity and openness toward women's education; today about 60 percent of those entering college in Iran are women.  He said that educated Iranians have less trust in mosques.  9.(C) The academic claimed that Iran is experiencing a cultural transition accompanied by greater social openness and a momentum towards change.  People can do and say things they could not ten or fifteen years ago.  Some mistrust the government, some look at Islam as tyranny, and overall there has been a drift away from strict Islam.  He said there were only a small group of people left in Iran that maintained the fundamentalist religious fervor of the early days of the revolution, not counting government workers who are required to display a degree of religious devotion.  He said that a new kind of religiosity has emerged in Iran, where people remain deeply religious but are anti-clerical and deeply suspicious of any privileges associated with the religious class.  Young people are against that kind of Islam, he said, and some are not interested in the ritualistic form of Islam supported by the Iranian government.  As an example of his assertion that clerics' involvement in politics had polluted their standing in society, he said that today turbaned and non-turbaned candidates have to plead in the same way for people's votes.  According to the academic, mystical works by eastern and western authors are becoming popular in Iran.  Shia Islam: capacity to evolve ------------------------------  10.(C) According to the scholar, Iran's new generation of clerics is somewhat moderate and open. They often study religion from anthropological, legal, historical, and other standpoints, and the scholar opined that this interdisciplinary perspective may inspire interesting changes in the future.  According to Iranian religious scholars, Shiites believe that divine law is not absolute, and that scholars with consent of a "faqih" or expert on Islamic jurisprudence, can always try to reach those principles which would be the decree of God, through the use of logic and reason.  One of the Tehrani businessmen said he agreed  RPO DUBAI 00000020  003.2 OF 003   Shiite Islam is more open to the concept of "ijtehad" (which allows Islamic laws to be modified based on the needs of the times).  Because of this, he believes Iran has a better chance than Sunni countries of becoming a modern democracy and perhaps a suitable future partner for the US.  The steel businessman, a modern man with children studying in the West, considered himself a devout Muslim.  He viewed Sunni Islam as more rigid, saying that generally the word of the Koran is accepted as law with no room for discussion, diversion, or votes on changing laws.  In his view, the "miracle" of Khomeini was that he brought the seeds of democracy to Iran, allowing Iranian men and women to vote.  He predicted that one day Iran could advance to a truly modern Islamic democracy.  The concept of Islamic democracy, he said, is a frequent subject of discussion in Iran's religious seminaries or Hawzehs.  Comment:  We frequently hear from contacts that whatever happens in Iran in the future, the society will remain a deeply religious one.  We also hear that a significant number of Iranian clerics, including Grand Ayatollah Sanei do not like clerical involvement in the government and oppose the system of velayat-e faqih.  (Note: Sanei, considered a reformist cleric, has called both nuclear weapons and suicide bombings un-Islamic.  Endnote)  These clerics prefer a model of their role in society more along the lines of the role that Grand Ayatollah Sistani plays in Iraq.  End comment BURNS

All three thought the action was preplanned, although it was less clear whether it had pre-approval by the Supreme Leader.  All felt the detention of the five Iranian Quds Force personnel by US forces in Irbil contributed to Iran's motivation for taking such an action, with Iran wanting to demonstrate its strength.  One contact claimed, however, that the detention of the five Iranians was not a major issue in Iranian public opinion.  Another contact thought the Iranian action may have also been an attempt by radicals to seize power away from the so-called pragmatists who purportedly gained strength with the outcome of the December elections.  The recommendations of these contacts for dealing with Iran vary greatly between those living in Iran and those outside.  End comment.  Former IRGC General believes Supreme Leader approved action --------------------------------------------- --------------  2.(S/NF) A purported former Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) general maintained that the motivation for the March 23 detention of British soldiers was the US detention in Irbil of five IRGC personnel, as well as UK-Iranian clashes (NFI) in Basra predating the detention.  According to the general, the IRGC was likely concerned that the British were planning an Irbil-type raid in Basra against it and wanted to preempt them with a show of strength.  He added that the incident appeared very well planned and was convinced the Supreme Leader gave his pre-approval.  He believes that President Ahmadi-Nejad is not a political decision-maker in Iran.  3.(S/NF) When asked why target the British if IRGC anger was mostly focused on the Irbil detentions, the former general reasoned that unlike the Americans, the British are already on their way out in Iraq so Iran would reason they would be less inclined than the Americans to escalate the situation.  Also, he said, Iran would like to be able to claim that they helped push the British out of Iraq, similar to Hizballah claims that it ended the Israeli occupation of Lebanon.  He doubted that the Iranians used the detention to test Western reaction to such an incident but said it served this purpose regardless.  Asked if he thought the intent of the Iranians was to change the subject of international discourse from the nuclear issue, he said he did not know, but that if that had been their intent, they were wrong to think it would work.  4.(S/NF) When asked if the Iranian government likely understood the highly negative international reaction that the video "confessions" of the detainees would provoke, the general said he doubted it, saying that those involved in the operation are largely ignorant of the West.  The general asserted that the peaceful resolution of the incident would likely have a positive impact on overall Iranian-Western relations, setting a precedent that diplomatic solutions work.  In contrast to some of our interlocutors (reftel), the former general asserted that Iran does not want direct conflict with the US.  5.(S/NF) The general went on to reason that releasing the five Iranians detained by the US in Irbil would provide a "golden opportunity" for further improving the political atmosphere.  He said it would send a message to Iran that when it takes a "positive" step, i.e. releasing the detainees, the US is prepared to reciprocate.  He claimed this strategy would weaken the extremists in Iran more than passing UN Security Council resolutions against the country.  He believes the Iranian people as a whole supported the detention of the British soldiers, as a warning to the West not to detain Iranians.  On the other hand, he acknowledged that the Iranian people do not seem too well informed or irate about the five Iranian detainees in Irbil. Nonetheless, he argued, their release without conditions would have a positive impact.  He said Iranians had taken note of an evolution in US rhetoric on Iran, based on a calmer, less aggressive tone.  Therefore, he reasoned, if the US made a positive gesture, public opinion in Iran would put pressure on the Iranian government to respond in kind.  6.(S/NF) When asked about public opinion in Iran regarding the  RPO DUBAI 00000021  002.2 OF 003   IRGC-Quds Force, he said the general public knew little about the various divisions within the IRGC and saw it as one organization.  He deflected the question about general attitudes towards the IRGC and talked instead about the history of the Quds Force.  He said it was created about 20 years ago, towards the end of the Iran-Iraq war, initially to help Palestinians combat Israeli aggression.  Since then, its mandate had been expanded to unconnected issues, such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  He added that its members are more competent and more committed to the revolution than the rest of the IRGC, and membership is very selective.  Professor assumes pre-approval ------------------------------  7.(S/NF) An Iranian professor said that the detention of the five Iranians in Irbil had a "huge effect" on the Iranian government, and that the government's response was the detention of the British sailors and marines.  He obviously believed Iranian press reports that the US would release the detainees by Nowruz and wondered why this had not occurred.  He added that the local IRGC commander (no name given) in the region where the Brits were picked up is not the type to take unauthorized actions, so he assumed there had been some kind of pre-approval.  Oppositionist says 50-50 chance leader approved --------------------------------------------- --  8.(S/NF) In a phone conversation prior to their release about the British detentions with US-based Mohsen Sazegara (please protect), a founder of the IRGC who has since become a reformer, Sazegara said there was a 50-50 chance that the incident had preapproval from the Supreme Leader.  Not everything in Iran is preplanned, he said.  He reasoned that such an event could have been orchestrated by a group of radicals to assert its political hand over pragmatists, who were bolstered by their general success in the December 2006 elections.  Whether or not the Supreme Leader had advanced warning of the incident mattered little, he said, since Supreme National Security Council Secretary Larijani's subsequent statements about the possibility  SIPDIS of trying the detainees indicated that the Supreme Leader was in control of the situation.  Larijani would not have gotten involved without the explicit instructions from the Supreme Leader, Sazegara reasoned.  9.(S/NF) Sazegara's explanations for why the detention occurred included several tacks:  -- whenever Iran has internal problems, it creates an external crisis -- for instance, the 1979 hostage situation (to distract from the chaos of the revolution) and the Salman Rushdie affair (to distract from the Iran-Iraq war ceasefire).  In this way, Iran can divert attention from internal issues and have an excuse to stir up nationalism and crack down on internal dissent.  (Note:  The British detentions occurring just prior to the passage of UNSCR 1747 certainly served to preempt news of the resolution's passage in Iran.  Endnote)  -- to demonstrate Iran's strength after three "humiliations": 1) detentions in Irbil of top Quds Force personnel; 2) two UNSCRs passed unanimously, including by "friends" of Iran; and 3) demonstrations by Russia of its ability to start and stop the Bushehr project.  10.(S/NF) Sazegara said that Iran likely had little fear it would pay a serious prices for  the detentions.  He claimed that the Supreme Leader's New Year message demonstrated his confidence that the US and West will not attack Iran. Furthermore, according to Sazegara, the Supreme Leader has tried for the last 10 years to create a situation where people think they have no power to do or change anything in Iran.  Therefore, reasoned Sazegara, the Supreme Leader currently believes he faces no real threat from internal groups or external forces. In Sazegara's view, Iran feels it can tolerate any sanction, short of an oil boycott, and it does not think the international community would impose an oil boycott because of oil demands.  11.(S/NF) Sazegara said he heard Khatami had met with the Supreme Leader (no timeframe given) and told him the situation was dangerous, and Iran was risking war, but the Supreme Leader told him not to worry, that Iran has the upper hand.  Many technocrats in the regime don't like the current situation, but they have no say, claimed Sazegara.  He added that if Rafsanjani  RPO DUBAI 00000021  003.2 OF 003   tries to exert influence, his sons are threatened with corruption investigations, leaving the Supreme Leader and the security and intelligence forces the upper hand.  12.(S/NF) Comment:  The policy recommendations regarding dealing with Iran from those still connected to Iran and those outside often vary widely.  In this case, the former general (now a Dubai-based businessman) and the professor both claim not to like Ahmadi-Nejad, and the professor in particular was critical of what he saw as a fundamental flaw of the regime trying to mix Islamic rule and democracy, but neither could be categorized as oppositionists.  (Note: both were introduced to IRPO by the same longstanding Iranian-American contact.  Endnote)  Sazegara has apparently completely broken with the regime and faces charges in Iran.  The general and the professor both advocated changing Iran's behavior through engagement, which they said would increase public pressure on the Iranian government to move toward rebuilding relations, although their recommendations seem unlikely to succeed.  The general proposed starting by releasing the Irbil detainees, and the professor claimed that opening up US trade would have greater impact on Iran than military action, while at the same time sparing the region greater instability. The professor, in particular,  did not seem to realize how unlikely it was that the US would open trade relations with Iran prior to resolving differences.  Sazegara, on the other hand, advocated threatening to deny Iran the ability to repatriate its profits from oil sales until it agrees to a Helsinki-type process and frees political prisons, reopens its shuttered reformist press, and holds free elections.  It would seem that this threat would only be effective if other countries would sign on, and that appears unlikely for the time being. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  According to a contact, President Ahmadi-Nejad's approval rating is at an all time low, his public remarks are - for the first time - completely scripted, and he is not an important policy player.  A UAE-based Iranian economist, recently back from Iran, said the capture and subsequent release of 15 British sailors was dismissed by the Iranian people as political maneuvering.  Gasoline prices at the pump recently increased per Majles legislation (reftel) - causing a 20% hike in cab fares - but the already printed ration cards (SmartCards) have not been distributed.  The Iranian people are convinced that the UN Security Council sanctions will eventually  target the oil and gas sector.  Even so, he claimed, Iran could sustain its economy under increased international pressure for some time.  End Summary.  2.(S) A UAE-based Iranian economist, who had just returned from a trip to Tehran, discussed his views of the current political and economic situation in Iran with IRPoff April 11.  The economist made clear that his assessments were based on anecdotal information from conversations in Iran with cab drivers, shopkeepers, and academics, and not scientific research.  Ahmadi-Nejad kept in line --------------------------------  3.(S) The economist claimed that the leadership has President Ahmadi-Nejad on a short leash because if you let him "off his leash" for even a second, he opens his mouth and causes problems.  Ahmadi-Nejad is not an important policy player and the current level of frustration and disappointment with President Ahmadi-Nejad - both amongst the people and within the government - is greater than ever before.  4.(S) The source indicated it was believed that Ahmadi-Nejad was "not allowed" to address the UN Security Council prior to its passing of Resolution 1747, as "everyone" knew he would "shoot himself in the foot."  Blaming the US for not issuing visas in a timely manner was simply a face-saving measure, and he claimed Iranians did not believe the government's story.  The contact said he heard that when Ahmadi-Nejad traveled to Gilan province, he  made tactless remarks about the women of the province, referring to a long-standing stereotype about their lack of morals.  People are saying that since his inappropriate provincial address, Ahmadi-Nejad is no longer "allowed" to speak freely.  When the president announced the release of the British soldiers, Ahmadi-Nejad's remarks were scripted for the first time, according to the economist.  British sailors ----------------  5.(S) The Iranian government successfully united its people by appealing to their nationalism in the face of "imperialism" by Britain, but only for a short time, opined the economist. Eventually the Iranian people dismissed the "squabble" over 400 meters of territorial water as political maneuvering and play acting by their government.  The Iranian people noticed that the hardliners backed away from their position once the situation escalated "out of their control," the economist asserted.  Economic frustration growing -----------------------------  6.(S) The economist expounded on the ever-growing list of economic woes in Iran.  Transportation cost hikes, coupled with a 40% increase in real estate prices, are hitting the Iranian people hard, he said.  The economist described the lack of economic vibrancy in Iran, saying businesses, in general, have experienced no growth in the past year.  He claimed that the Iranian people are in a holding pattern; they reportedly are focused on survival and no longer even have aspirations to improve their quality of life.  He attributed this apathy to the "massive welfare state" created by the Iranian government.  7.(C) He said that gasoline prices at the pump recently increased per Majles legislation from roughly 8 cents to 11  RPO DUBAI 00000022  002.2 OF 002   cents per liter (reftel) - causing a 20% hike in cab fares. However, SmartCards to establish rationing have not been distributed, although they have been printed.  8.(S) Consistent with frequent claims, the economist asserted that as long as Iran can sell its oil and prices stay high, it can support this welfare state.  Because the Iranian people know it is widely understood how much oil sales buffer the government from foreign pressure, he said they are convinced that the UNSC sanctions will eventually target the oil and gas sector, despite statements to the contrary.  He predicted that in this case, Iran would still be able to subsist, given its domestic agricultural production capabilities and its leaders' "addiction to international isolation."  9.(S) Comment:  The economist retains close ties to Iran, and his economic comments have proved credible in the past.  His advice to the West to bring about change in Iran, however reflects his pro-Rafsanjani tendencies.  He claimed that if the West wanted to see "real" change in Iran, it should drop all sanctions and attempt to fully integrate Iran into the international community.  He asserted that the current leaders maintain power by controlling the flow of people and information in and out of the country and greater openness would weaken their control. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  A reformist member of the Majles said the Supreme Leader favors Islamic regional interests over national interests and called the president a puppet of the leader.  He claimed some radicals wanted war as an excuse to crack down on dissent and cover up their shortcomings.  He acknowledged reformists' limited ability to impact policy but called the threats of impeachment a powerful tool.  The long-term goal of the reformist coalition Mosharekat is to reform the constitution to eliminate or change the position of Supreme Leader to an elected, accountable position.  He advised reducing what he called the negative tone of VOA's  Farsi broadcasts and focus on supplying objective information to produce an informed electorate.  End summary.  2.(S) On April 11, IRPOffs met with a member of the Majles who is aligned with the reformist coalition Mosharekat (also called the Islamic Iran Participation Front).  The MP shared his opinions about the state of internal politics in Iran and commented on international crises related to Iran.  He has met with IRPOffs previously, on the fringe of his US visa applications.  He claims ongoing communication with other reform leaders, including former President Khatami.  Supreme Leader: Islamic interests over national --------------------------------------------- --  3.(S) The MP believes that Supreme Leader Khamenei aspires to become the "emperor" of the Islamic world and is willing to sacrifice Iranian national interests for this goal.  He sees President Ahmadi-Nejad as merely a puppet of the Supreme Leader, under the leader's complete control.  Ahmadi-Nejad, in turn, sees more pragmatic conservatives such as Larijani and Qalibaf as his main rivals.  The MP claimed the president is not worried about reformists.  4.(S) Speaking about Iran-US tensions, the MP opined that some conservatives in Iran want to go to war for the following reasons (Note: views shared by some other contacts. Endnote):  -- to crack down on reformists and further resist change; -- to appear strong and capable to the Iranian public, as defenders of the nation; -- to hide government failures.  Threats of impeachment: the reformist weapon of choice --------------------------------------------- ---------  5.(S) The MP claimed that after the December 15 elections, hardliners attempted to take away the seat won in the Tehran Majles by-election by female reformist Soheila Jelodarzadeh. (Note: this is the first time IRPO has heard this claim. Endnote)  The MP said that reformists united and threatened to impeach the interior minister, and Ms. Jelodarzadeh kept her seat.  6.(S) The MP mentioned other past efforts to impeach administration officials, including the president, noting they had failed to gather enough support.  He said, however, if there is another UNSC resolution against Iran following UNSCR 1747, reform groups are determined to impeach Foreign Minister Mottaki, and ultimately President Ahmadi-Nejad.  The MP indicated they were more likely to be able to gather the votes needed to impeach Mottaki than Ahmadi-Nejad, but he said they were determined to make an effort.  The MP praised the passage of UNSC resolutions 1737 and 1747 as effective diplomacy and specifically praised the efforts and rhetoric of Under Secretary Burns.  7.(S) The MP said the Mosharekat reformist coalition has the eventual goal of changing the constitution to eliminate or change the position of the Supreme Leader to an elected office with accountability.  He noted, however, that some reformists, such as former Majles speaker Karroubi, are opposed to amending the constitution.  The MP claimed that Karroubi, former president Khatami, and even Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani cannot criticize the government as much as they might want to, because they would be marginalized.  IRGC ----  8.(S) The MP said the Iranian press has reported very few details about the identities of the five Iranians detained by  RPO DUBAI 00000023  002.2 OF 002   the US in Irbil, which he saw as a strong indication the men are military, not diplomats as the Iranian government claims. Separately, he claimed that according to fellow Majles deputy and former IRGC officer, Health Commission rapporteur Dr. Heydarpur, members of the IRGC do not necessarily support Ahmadi-Nejad.  They must, however, follow the dictates of the Supreme Leader.  9.(S) The MP claimed the government is very concerned about the whereabouts of former deputy Defense Minister Ali Reza Asgari, who reportedly went missing in Turkey in February 2007. According to the MP, Asgari has the rank of IRGC commander and is a key IRGC insider with access to a great deal of sensitive information.  As the government is uncertain whether he defected or was abducted, it does not know whether to attack him as a traitor and a liar or defend him as a captured hero.  The UK sailor crisis --------------------  10.(S) Regarding the government's detention of 15 British sailors, the MP opined that the government had planned the incident as a diversion from UNSCR 1747, which was eliciting public criticism of the government's handling of the nuclear issue.  Citing a widely repeated rumor that the UK has cQl and influence over the clerical government ("everybody knows the mullahs usually obey England"), the MP doubted that the sailor crisis would not have escalated beyond diplomacy, calling it simply a political stunt.  VOA broadcasts too anti-Iran? -----------------------------  11.(S) The MP believed that the underlying theme of Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts was regime change for Iran in all but name, which he said undermines USG claims that its policy towards Iran is changed behavior, not regime change.  He argued that predominantly negative coverage of Iran is counter-productive, alienating viewers.  In order to educate the people and work toward the goal of democracy promotion in Iran, he recommended that the VOA report facts and objective information, with the goal of creating a better-informed Iranian public.  12.(C) Comment: This Majles deputy is an outspoken member of the reformist minority faction in the Majles, with views representative of the Khatami-era reformist school of thought. He is one of a small number of reformists from the previous Majles who are still active within the system, and has demonstrated willingness to publicly criticize the Ahmadi-Nejad government.  He claims his car was recently vandalized after he gave a critical speech, and he does not think he will be allowed to run again in 2008.  While it is doubtful he has much direct contact with members of government, his comments about the political state of play in Iran are valuable coming from inside the system.  He acknowledges that the reformists in the Majles have little ability to directly effect policy changes but claims the threat of impeachment has weight.  He indicated his own support for US-Iranian parliamentary exchanges, but expressed some doubt that the Iranian government would allow this to happen.  13.(SBU) Comment continued:  Although the MP did not specifically mention the recently aired VOA interview with Abdul-Malek Rigi, the leader of the violent Baluchi separatist group Jundallah with his criticisms of VOA programming, that interview in particular was widely condemned in Iran.  Jundallah claimed responsibility for February terrorist attacks in Iran's southeastern Sistan-va-Baluchestan province that killed 11 and injured 31.  The Foreign Ministry spokesman released a statement about the Rigi interview, saying "the aforementioned terrorist is under prosecution for drug smuggling, kidnapping, murder, and injuring some of our compatriots, so what VOA has done is in direction of double standards of the US government in fighting against terrorism."

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary:  The National Iranian Oil Company seeks investments from international companies to increase recovery capabilities, said Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari at Dubai's 15th annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference April 15-17.  Nozari repeatedly stressed Iran's openness to foreign investment in the oil sector.  Chairman and CEO of FACTS Global Energy, USA Fereidun Fesharaki said his company expects to see much smaller gas export volumes coming out of Iran due to domestic needs, pricing, and political factors.  Neil Patrick from the International Crisis Group called on Saudi Arabia - in particular - to ease regional tensions by interfacing with former President Rafsanjani and Secretary of the National Security Council Larijani.  Rutgers  SIPDIS University professor Hooshang Amirahmadi said that the stalemate of "no peace but no war" that has defined US-Iran relations for the past 28 years cannot continue.  One US service sector company employee complained to IRPoff that American companies continue to "lose out" as they stand back and watch their European competitors do business in Iran.  End Summary.  2.(SBU) Singapore-based Conference Connection Group organized the 15th annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference (MPGC) in Dubai April 15-17.  The two-day event focused primarily on pricing, risk management, downstream projects and upstream outlooks, with Iran only a small component of the conference. (Note:  This cable focuses solely on the Iran-related content of the conference.  Most conference presentations are available upon request.  Endnote)  Iran Deputy Petroleum Minister Gholamhossein Nozari gave one of two ministerial addresses, joined by UAE Minister of Energy Mohamed bin Dhaen Al Hamli. Neil Patrick from the International Crisis Group and Hooshang Amirahmadi, Rutgers University professor and president of the American Iranian Council discussed the geopolitical and economic impact of the Iranian government on the region.  One conference participant estimated that roughly 450 participants gathered in Dubai for the event but said the real players did not attend the plenary sessions because they were busy holding meetings off-site.  Iran: open for business ----------------------------  3.(SBU) Gholamhossein Nozari -- who is both the Deputy Oil Minister and the Managing Director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) -- addressed participants at the MPGC for roughly 15 minutes, covering the current and future development of Iran's oil and gas fields.  Nozari's speech had no political content and consisted of a general overview of Iran's energy sector; there was no question and answer session after his speech.  At least five times he stressed that Iran is open to foreign investment in the energy sector and that the NIOC is looking forward to cooperating with international companies to develop Iran's oil reserves (44% of its hydrocarbons) and its gas reserves (56%).  The NIOC would like international support to increase its recovery capabilities, said Nozari, particularly in the Azadegan, Yadavaran, and Kish fields.  Nozari said crude oil made up 92% of Iran's hydrocarbon production in 2005, but expected this number to decrease to 76% of production by 2015. Nozari predicted only a minimal increase in Iran's oil production through 2015, but a four-fold increase in gas production.  Future gas projections -----------------------------  4. (U)  In the portion of his presentation that covered Iran, Fereidun Fesharaki, CEO and Chairman of FACTS Global Energy, USA predicted reduced natural gas exports from Iran in the future. FACTS forecasts that Iran has a lifetime liquefied natural gas export ceiling of 20-30 million tons and "small" volumes of natural gas exports due to: -- large domestic grid at prices of 1 cent/cubic meter; -- massive domestic gas injection requirements of some 10 billion cubic feet/day; -- massive domestic gas-based petroleum projects; -- compressed natural gas projects will provide a major volume of domestic gasoline supplies as early as the end of this decade; -- and major political opposition to gas exports.  Geopolitical perspective -----------------------------  RPO DUBAI 00000024  002.2 OF 002    5.(U) Neil Patrick from the International Crisis Group called on Gulf states to join together and collectively raise the "Arab" flag and communicate red lines in their dealings with Iran regarding Iraq, Palestine-Israel, and Iranian-Syrian relations. Patrick called on Arab states - led by Saudi Arabia - to be more vocal in determining regional policies.  Patrick recommended to Arab states to maintain dialogue with more "moderate" Iranian leaders, such as former President Rafsanjani and Secretary of the National Security Council Larijani, to advance Arab interests without provoking Iran.  6.(U) Iranian American Council USA President and Rutgers University professor Hooshang Amirahmadi said the "no peace, but yet no war" mentality that has dominated US-Iran relations for the past 28 years cannot continue.  Hooshang gave a very impassioned presentation on Iran's "mismanaged" foreign policy and Iran's historical lack of trust vis-`-vis the West which he said has culminated in the current "spiraling conflict with the US."  Answering questions from participants, Hooshang asserted that USG intentions include regime change.  7.(S) Comment:  Because there were no questions after Nozari's speech, it was difficult to gauge audience reaction to his calls for foreign investment.   While US company officials openly engaged with IRPoff on the subject of Iran during conference breaks, non-US company officials shied away once they learned IRPoff was a US diplomat.  American comments were mostly complaints that their European competitors continue to turn a profit in Iran, while they are forced to stand on the sidelines.  One employee from India's Reliance Energy quickly headed for the door after he confided in another conference participant - in front of IRPoff - that Reliance's business with Iran is still strong but has tapered off somewhat in recent months.  End comment. BURNS

Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  The head of Tehran's UNODC office sees the recent dismissal of Fada Hossein Maleki as head of the Drug Control Headquarter as a sign that President Ahmadi-Nejad got the upper hand over Expediency Council head Rafsanjani. Although appointed by Ahmadi-Nejad, Maleki reportedly moved into Rafsanjani's camp as he came to see value in international engagement on the drug issue.  When he reportedly confronted Ahmadi-Nejad over the president's decision not to let him attend a ministerial level meeting in Vienna, Ahmadi-Nejad fired him but was unable to actually get rid of him until the crisis over the British sailors strengthened his position over pragmatists, in Arbitrio's view.  The UN official noted that while he believed hardliners currently had the upper hand in Iran, the internal political dynamics could shift again. He also said Iranians increasingly recognize that their own government is the source of Iran's tense international relations.  End summary.  2.(S/NF) UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Tehran-based Field rep Roberto Arbitrio (Italian citizen, please protect) opined in an April 21 meeting with IRPOffs that the recent dismissal of Fada Hossein Maleki as secretary-general of the Drug Control Headquarters demonstrates that currently hardliners have the upper hand in Iran.  Arbitrio's account fills in holes from recent conflicting reports in the Iranian press whether or not Maleki was on his way out, prior to the definitive news of Brigadier General Esmaeel Ahmadi-Moqaddam's swearing-in April 11.  Arbitrio's assessment is based on a conversation between his staff and Maleki and therefore only tells Maleki's side of the story.  Arbitrio's updates on the drug situation in Iran and Iran's regional cooperation to be provided septel.  Maleki unemployed or not? -------------------------  3.(S/NF) As background, Arbitrio said that when UNODC Director General Costa visited Iran in November 2006, Maleki appealed to him for assistance in helping Iran approach the international community on the drug issue via Afghanistan and specifically NATO.  Maleki's interest in international engagement, Arbitrio said, was the result of UNODC's efforts over a year and a half to convince him of the benefits of such activities.  He noted that in Costa's subsequent meeting with Ahmadi-Nejad, the president did not specifically reiterate the point about reaching out to NATO, calling only for regional engagement. Nonetheless, UNODC assumed his endorsement, given that Maleki was seen as close to Ahmadi-Nejad, who had appointed him.  4.(S/NF) According to Arbitrio, Costa took this request on board and worked on organizing a ministerial level delegation from Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan to address major donors in Vienna.  When he heard the meeting was moving ahead, Maleki was reportedly very happy and grateful, and said he would attend. However, when the Iranian authorities sent passports to the Tehran UNODC office for the trip, Maleki's was missing.  Late February, UNODC in Tehran heard that perhaps Maleki would not go and perhaps no one else would go either.  However, in Vienna, the Iranian mission told UNODC that all was on track.  By February 27, Arbitrio, already in Vienna, heard no one was traveling from Iran.  Reportedly, the Pakistanis were very upset when they heard the Iranians were pulling out, and Afghanistan and Pakistan eventually sent a lower level delegation.  5.(S/NF) On March 2, Iranian Ambassador Soltaniyeh requested a meeting with Costa, attended by Arbitrio.  Soltaniyeh reportedly made no apologies for Iran's no-show, simply saying that Maleki had a "personal commitment," and reiterated Iran's interest in increasing international cooperation.  Costa was reportedly very upset by Iran's handling of the matter but said he would continue to try to facilitate international contacts.  6.(S/NF) Arbitrio said his staff later (no date given) talked directly to Maleki about what had happened.  Maleki reportedly said that when he learned about the ministerial meeting, he requested a meeting with Ahmadi-Nejad.  After the president "reluctantly" gave him an appointment, he told Maleki he would not approve the meeting.  When Maleki pressed for a reason, saying that Costa had organized the meeting as a response to the president's request, Ahmadi-Nejad gave no explanation.  7.(S/NF) According to Arbitrio's readout of the conversation  RPO DUBAI 00000026  002.2 OF 003   with Maleki, others lobbied the president to change his mind about Iranian attendance at the Vienna meeting, including Judiciary chief Shahroudi and Foreign Minister Mottaki, without success.  Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi could not even get a meeting with the president, according to Maleki.  Maleki claimed he managed to get a second meeting with Ahmadi-Nejad in which he pleaded to be allowed to go.  When Ahmadi-Nejad did not change his mind, Maleki claimed he told the president he was making a mistake, and Ahmadi-Nejad reportedly responded by firing him.  8.(S/NF) Maleki reportedly then contacted Expediency Council Chair Rafsanjani, who got angry that he had not been consulted. According to Iran's drug policy, the president is the chair of the Drug Control Headquarters, but the Expediency Council plays a supervisory role.  After some kind of intervention by Rafsanjani, Maleki's dismissal was reportedly rescinded, and Maleki traveled mid-March to Vienna for a different anti-narcotics meeting.  In Vienna, Maleki reportedly reassured Costa that he was still in charge.  Arbitrio said it was a strange delegation that traveled with Maleki, less than half of whom seemed pro-Maleki, most pro-IRGC.  When Maleki met with Costa, the delegation insisted on providing its own interpreter, which Arbitrio said was not standard.  9.(S/NF) Per Arbitrio's Foreign Ministry sources, the source of the tension between Maleki and Ahmadi-Nejad was Maleki's growing closeness with Rafsanjani.  As Maleki reportedly came to see the value of engagement on the drug issue to Iran's overall foreign policy, he gradually moved towards Rafsanjani, who was more sympathetic to this view than Ahmadi-Nejad.  Ahmadi-Nejad was reportedly unhappy about the situation but only saw his chance to act upon it in the aftermath of the British sailors crisis. According to Arbitrio, Ahmadi-Nejad had orchestrated the incident to get the upper hand over the pragmatists.  Arbitrio believes that one consequence of the situation was that Ahmadi-Nejad succeeded in dismissing Maleki.  Two days after the sailors' release, Maleki received his dismissal letter.  What was particularly unusual, the letter did not include an onward assignment.  10.(S/NF) Arbitrio also commented he was surprised how out-of-the-loop the Foreign Ministry had been on the issue, saying that UNODC heard before the ministry did that Maleki was not being allowed to attend the ministerial meetings in Vienna.  Starting over with a new head -----------------------------  11.(S/NF) Maleki's replacement, Ahmadi-Moqaddam, also retains his role as Chief of Police and supposedly has the protection of the president.  He is reportedly married to the president's sister.  He comes out of the IRGC and reportedly met Ahmadi-Nejad working on security issues in Kurdistan.  He was also deputy commander of the Basij.  Rafsanjani reportedly criticized Moqaddam for helping Ahmadi-Nejad in the presidential elections.  Arbitrio said that Maleki had earlier told him before that Ahmadi-Nejad wanted to replace him with Moqaddam, in order to get the police inside the Drug Control Headquarters.  12.(S/NF) Arbitrio, who was in Dubai en route to Pakistan, said he would meet Moqaddam for the first time after his return to Iran.  He expressed frustration at having to rebuild a relationship with the new head and - he hoped - convince him of the benefits of international engagement on the drug issue. Arbitrio could not say he understood what Ahmadi-Nejad's policy on the issue was.  Maleki's dismissal could have been the result of policy differences on this issue of international engagement, or it could have been simply intended to punish Maleki for switching alliances.  He also noted that other issues could have been at play.  Maleki had come from mid-level ranks of the Ministry of Interior and as such was not widely accepted by the police.  This supposedly caused problems in implementing Drug Control Headquarters policy.  Now, the drug office and the anti-narcotics police are unified, but Arbitrio said it was too soon to judge whether this would have positive or negative effects on drug policy.  He also repeated a rumor that Moqaddam may have been appointed to the new position in essence to sideline him because of unhappiness with his performance regarding the deteriorating security situation in Sistan-va Baluchistan.  Hardliners on the upsurge -------------------------  RPO DUBAI 00000026  003.2 OF 003    13.(S/NF) Arbitrio, who very clearly caveats between what he knows and what he surmises, said he believes that as a result of the seizure of the British sailors, the hardliners generally have the upper hand in Iran.  He noted, however, that this could change at any time, making Iranian decision-making hard to predict.  He believes that Ahmadi-Nejad knows he faces a legitimacy gap, demonstrated in every democratic exercise in Iran, including the December 2006 elections and the push-back he has gotten from the Majles.  Arbitrio said the Iranians he knows believe the hardliners know they will lose in any future election absent any change, so the hardliners are either plotting to forego elections or to make sure elections are held in a crisis situation.  Therefore, in Arbitrio's view, Ahmadi-Nejad uses crises like the nuclear issue and the British sailors to artificially create consensus and to confront pragmatists.  Arbitrio also believes that Ahmadi-Nejad, who he has met in two short meetings as well as the long meeting with Costa, suffers from a Napoleonic complex (Arbitrio estimated his height at 168 cm).  He had heard that the president has fired people for being taller than him.  14.(S/NF) The religious-military alliance sees itself above democracy, and isolation and tension simply empowers them. Arbitrio also claimed that Iran is increasingly militarized, citing visible anti-aircraft weapons both around Tehran and en route to Esfahan.  He is also increasingly doubtful of the Supreme Leader's control over the situation.  He thinks the Supreme Leader feels more threatened by Rafsanjani than by Ahmadi-Nejad, particularly given Rafsanjani's calls to reassess the role of the Supreme Leader.  Arbitrio also said that he is hearing for the first time in a long time that there are limits to Rafsanjani's scope of action, and he doubted reformers could have much impact on the political scene.  15.(S/NF) Arbitrio said there is a real fear in Iran that war is on the horizon.  UNODC and embassies are doing contingency planning, he has stocked up on food and water at home, and embassies are counting their nationals.  One ambassador told him that until three months ago, he thought conflict was unlikely but that he was now discouraged and saw no sign that Iran would pursue a sensible solution.  One change Arbitrio noted among Iranian people with whom he has contact, however, was that in the past they blamed US policy for the tense bilateral relations, but now they've realized that their president is to blame.  They are more worried what the "Iranian Hizballah" will do and say next than what the US will do.  They also see that it is no longer a US-Iran issue, but that the international community is unified in their objections to Iranian behavior. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(S/NF) National police chief General Esmaeel Ahmadi-Moqaddam is the new secretary-general of the Drug Control Headquarters, replacing Fada-Husseini Maleki, announced the Iranian government in early April.  General Ahmadi-Moqaddam said that President Ahmadi-Nejad hired him to address the drug issue as a law enforcement officer.  The head of the UN office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Tehran Roberto Arbitrio gave IRPO an update on Iran's narcotics program April 21.  Our UNODC expert believes these developments in the area of drug control reflect an overall trend in Iranian government to crack-down on perceived moral decay.  How this sudden change of drug chiefs will actually affect issues of drug control and rehabilitation remains to be seen.  Arbitrio's description of the events leading up to the change in drug officials to be reported septel.  End Summary  National Police chief, as the new drug tsar -------------------------------------------  2.(S/NF) The head of the UNODC office in Tehran Roberto Arbitrio (please protect), who occasionally briefs IRPO on drug-related issues when passing through Dubai, provided an update of the recent shift in the management of Iran's drug control program April 21.  According to the UNODC official, his Iranian associate and interlocutor Fada-Hussein Maleki, Iran's head of drug control, was unexpectedly replaced by the national police chief General Esmaeel Ahmadi-Moqaddam in early April.  Arbitrio said that General Ahmadi-Moqaddam is rumored to be a former Basij leader, who supported President Ahmadi-Nejad during his presidential campaign and is also married to the president's sister.  Though the replacement of Maleki is due to political reasons said Arbitrio (reported septel), the selection of Ahmadi-Moqaddam is a step to intensify the country's already strict drug control program.  3.(S/NF) Arbitrio said the extent to which the union between the Drug Control Headquarters with police may affect different aspects of drug control is yet unclear.  According to an April 12 Iran daily article, Ahmadi-Moqaddam maintained a strong focus on rehabilitation of addicts and did not just focus on law enforcement.  He told reporters on the sidelines of his inauguration ceremony that the police plan to collect and rehabilitate about 300,000 high-risk drug addicts during the current Persian calendar year, which started March 21, and that the ministries of health, welfare and other offices will cooperate.  He said addicts should be treated (not imprisoned), while adding that addicts are considered criminals unless they contact a rehabilitation center for treatment.  4.(S/NF) Despite these statements, Arbitrio understands that President Ahmadi-Nejad hired Ahmadi-Moqaddam to address the drug issue as a law enforcement officer.  Though Ahmadi-Moqaddam said he has always been supportive of Iran's drug policy, Arbitrio thinks it is possible that the dismissal of Maleki, already considered a hard-liner, together with the government's recent pressures on issues of morality (such as the recent crackdown on women's dress code) may indicate a more severe approach.  Drug control and Iran's borders -------------------------------  5.(S/NF) According to Arbitrio, Iran is highly concerned about Pakistan's ability to control its border with Iran and the operation of Jundullah group in Sistan-va Baluchistan.  Arbitrio said the security situation in the east is deteriorating.  He described a helicopter trip last November in which he took ambassadors to inspect the southern border area, a trip he said he could not make today due to the lack of security.  Arbitrio said the Iranian side of the border was well equipped with watch towers, trenches, and fences, while he did not observe any similar security measures on the Pakistani side of the border.  6.(S/NF) Arbitrio explained that cooperation on border security issues between Iran and Afghanistan is much more positive than that between Iran and Pakistan.  Afghanistan is interested in learning from Iran's expertise, and there remains a degree of trust.  He said that UNODC is trying to use Iran to facilitate greater Afghanistan-Pakistan cooperation, noting that Pakistan is increasingly serving as a transit point for drugs between Afghanistan and Iran.  7.(S/NF) According to Arbitrio, Iran has major concerns about  RPO DUBAI 00000027  002.2 OF 003   all of its borders and feels they are inflamed, in particular the Baluchi, Kurdish, and Azeri regions.  UNODC promoting Iran's regional collaboration ---------------------------------------------  8.(S/NF) Arbitrio said that UNODC has been working in Iran since the late 1990's not only with the objective to assist Tehran in reducing narcotics trafficking and drug abuse, but to also strengthen regional and national cooperation on drug control. Arbitrio indicated that UNODC would continue its policy of facilitating the process of international engagement on the drug issue, albeit in the face of suspicion from many in the region. He said the UNODC had several regional meetings lately in the Caspian region, Caucuses, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf.  He said that in the Caspian region, Azerbaijan is especially interested in increasing bilateral relations, as they currently deal through multilateral programs with Russia.  Russia and Iran were still discussing exchanging drug liaison officers.  9.(S/NF) The three Caucuses countries and Turkey have generally positive cooperation with Iran and plan to continue cooperating.  He noted that the Turks seemed pleased that the new head of the Drug Control Headquarters had a background dealing with security issues in Kurdistan.  The Gulf countries, however, are more sensitive and concerned about cooperation with Iran.  Saudi Arabia, Arbitrio said, is particularly suspicious of Iran regarding narcotics but is keeping channel open for bilateral cooperation.  He noted that in general the UAE, considered a very important UNODC partner, prefers bilateral cooperation with Iran over dealing via the GCC.  Arbitrio noted UNODC would soon produce a report out of a recent round of international consultations.  10.(S/NF) UNODC is also facilitating collaboration between Iran and East Asian countries.  Arbitrio said several antinarcotics delegations recently went to Iran, and had interesting exchanges; these included Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. Next on the agenda is a visit to Iran by Indonesian religious leaders, followed by collaboration with China.  Possible recycling of seized opium? -----------------------------------  11.(S/NF) According to Arbitrio, after the revolution, the new Islamic government declared its opposition to continuing licit opium cultivation for pharmaceutical use in Iran.  Recently, the government requested reauthorization to legalize opium production for pharmaceutical use, but Arbitrio doubted the request would be granted.  Arbitrio, commenting on the disposition of the 200-300 tons of seized opiates a year in Iran, acknowledged corruption within the police.  He also noted recent arrests for police corruption.  He suspected, however, that much of the opium or heroin was illegally routed to Iranian pharmaceutical companies for the production of legal, opium-based medicine.  If true, this would be a violation of the UN requirement to destroy all seized drugs.  New "crack" gains popularity ----------------------------  12.(S/NF) Arbitrio indicated that  because Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, is producing a surplus of 30% over demand, dealers are encouraging increased consumption of opium and its derivatives by creating and marketing new products and new systems of consumption, such as cocktailing.  Arbitrio predicted such efforts will also spread in the West. (Note: cocktailing refers to combining a number of drugs together. Endnote)  Arbitiro said that the current drug of choice in Iran is compressed heroin or "crack," growing in popularity in comparison to opium or normal heroin.  (Note: What is called crack in Iran is heroine-based, unlike the cocaine based crack in the West. Endnote)  This crack is approximately one-sixth heroin and is typically smoked in pipes.  Drug treatment --------------  13.(S/NF) Arbitrio spoke positively about drug addiction treatment in Iran, particularly in terms of government policy. He said Iran uses the entire range of drug treatment techniques, from homeopathic, psychological, methadone and other advanced pharmaceutical programs, to the combination of them all. However, currently the availability of drug treatment is very low compared to the estimated 4 million drug users.  He said NGO's provide free treatment, and that the government also provides free and low cost treatments.  Paid private clinics are  RPO DUBAI 00000027  003.2 OF 003   used by rich Iranians, Arbitrio said.  Causes of drug use ------------------  14.(S/NF) In a wrap-up discussion, Arbitrio discussed why Iranians are increasingly turning to drugs.  He said that life in Iran has become more depressing, and that there is a clear economic crisis; average salaries are 150-200 thousand tomans (about 150-200 dollars), salaries are often not paid in months, and people's first idea is to leave the country.  He said the educated were not interested in President Ahmadi-Nejad's vision of the future, and there is also increasing fear of an international conflict.  He said if he were a young Iranian boy with little hope for a successful future, he couldn't be sure he wouldn't join the popular drug culture.  He noted an alarming increase of women and children turning to drug use.  He mentioned a recent movie about a young middle class Iranian girl who becomes addicted to drugs, which won an award at Toronto film festival.  He said the government did not like the film but allowed it to be shown.  15.(S/NF) Comment:  Regardless of Iran's relatively progressive drug programs and policies, the country has not been successful in preventing an epidemic of drug abuse.  Punishment of people involved with drugs from addicts to smugglers has been Iran's drug control policy since the 1990's, and today more than 40% of the Iranian prison population is comprised of individuals arrested for drug offenses.  This situation could worsen if the recent appointment of the police chief to head the Drug Control Headquarters leads to a much heavier emphasis on interdiction and away from drug treatment.  It is doubtful that such a policy would succeed, for as Arbitrio said and others echo, economic depression, coupled with social repression, is major reasons for Iran's drug epidemic.  As long as the country has high levels of unemployment and under-employment, it is doubtful Iran will make much progress in its war on drugs. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary.  Iranian economist and journalist Ali Farahbakhsh was arrested at Tehran airport after returning from an economic conference in Thailand in November 2006, according to Iranian press.  An opposition blog said he was "located" in Evin Prison 40 days after his arrest.  He was accused of espionage, investigated, tried, and finally sentenced to three years in prison for receiving $2,300 from outside agencies - an amount that Farahbakhsh reportedly claims was paid to him to cover his trip expenses.  A close IRPO contact, who claims to be a good friend and former university classmate of Farahbakhsh, said that Farahbakhsh is not a political activist.  He is, said the contact, an economist who speaks his mind - but one that maybe should "think twice" before actually sending his analysis to print.  IRPO Dubai recommends that Farahbakhsh's case be included in any upcoming press statements on human rights or press freedom in Iran.  At the same time, we recommend against singling out his case or inferring that he is a political activist.  To our knowledge, it was likely his frank economic criticism of government policy that landed him in trouble.  It is also troubling for our own exchange programs that Iranians are being prosecuted for accepting funds for international travel.  End Summary.  The criminal case against Farahbakhsh ---------------------------------------------  2.(U) Ali Farahbakhsh, an economist and journalist for now banned reformist dailies Yas-e Now and Shargh, was arrested in Tehran airport after returning from an economic conference reportedly organized by an NGO in Thailand in November 2006. (Note:  Amnesty International reported that he attended a conference on government and the media, while other sources specify it was an economic conference.  No further information is known.  Endnote).  Farahbakhsh was detained without charge and his family was reportedly not informed of his whereabouts for several weeks.  On January 22 Advar News released a portion of a letter that the wife and parents of Farahbakhsh sent to Judiciary head Hashemi Shahrudi.  The letter accused the Judiciary of keeping Farahbakhsh in solitary confinement for 44 days before transferring him to a general cell, despite the fact that he had not been charged with any crime, and that he had not been given access to an attorney.  The letter also claimed that Farahbakhsh developed serious digestive problems and "bleeding of the stomach" due to the "unpleasant mode of interrogation." Farahbakhsh was, according to the family, threatening to go on a hunger strike unless he was given an explanation for his detention - something that the family was deeply concerned about due to the seriousness of his health condition.  3.(U)  Less than two weeks later, on January 31, the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) announced that Farahbakhsh had an attorney and was charged with espionage for passing intelligence to foreigners after taking part in a conference abroad.  On April 23, an opposition blog claimed that although Farahbakhsh was originally accused of espionage, ultimately he was sentenced to three years in prison for receiving $2,300 from outside "agencies" - an amount Farahbakhsh says was paid to him to cover his travel expenses to Thailand.  Personal insight ------------------  4. (C) A reliable IRPO contact, who claims to be a good friend and former university classmate of Farahbakhsh when both were studying economics,  said that Farahbakhsh has never been politically active.  According to the contact, Farahbakhsh is an economist by training and writes articles purely from an economic perspective.  The contact asserted that Farahbakhsh perhaps did not exercise enough self-censorship and thought he tended to be too outspoken in his articles.  A search of OSC yielded a 2003 editorial in Yas-e Now in which Farahbakhsh outlined political hurdles standing in the way of executing Iran's third economic plan, highlighting that Iran's political system results in "extensive lack of coordination in making decisions and in implementing plans."  5.(C) Comment.  IRPO Dubai recommends that the next time the Department makes a call for greater respect for human rights in Iran, Farahbakhsh's case could be included, in addition to other cases.  We do not recommend spotlighting his case alone, given that he is apparently being prosecuted for accepting funds to travel to a foreign conference, an accusation that could be leveled at our exchange program participants.  We also recommend  RPO DUBAI 00000028  002.2 OF 002   taking care not to infer that we see him as a political activist.  As far as we can tell, it was his frank criticism of Iranian economic policy that landed him in trouble with the government, something Iran could certainly use more of. BURNS 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000030  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  5/3/2017 TAGS: PGOV, ECON, IR SUBJECT: IRANIAN ECONOMIC POLICY:  AN EASY TARGET FOR CRITICS  REF: RPO DUBAI 0011  RPO DUBAI 00000030  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d) 1.(C) Summary.  While IRPO contacts have long criticized Iranian economic policy in private conversations, top figures in Iran appear increasingly vocal in public condemnations of  President Ahmadi-Nejad's programs.  After a  lull in criticism during the Nowruz holiday and the British sailor crisis, the pace has increased as inflation rises and new sanctions loom ahead.  The head of the Majles Research Center lambasted the government for sidelining experts and technocrats.  Majles deputies are criticizing the government's inability to address poverty and unemployment.  The Majles planning and budget committee cautions the government against borrowing from the foreign exchange account to finance current expenditures.  Ex-presidential candidate and advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri called on the president to listen to economic advisors and make "prudent" policies, and former President  Rafsanjani advocated for a more "balanced" economic approach.  Although general analysis suggests that high oil prices will keep the economy afloat in spite of Ahmadi-Nejad's mismanagement, some contacts are increasingly doubtful that oil profits will offset the rapidly declining economic situation.  End Summary.  Sidelining of experts ----------------------  2.(U) "The ninth government does not pay sufficient attention to expert views and methods before taking decisions, and I warn against the low efficiency of the ninth government," said Majles deputy and head of the Majles Research Center Ahmad  Tavakkoli, who ran against Ahmadi-Nejad in the last presidential election, at a conference April 25 on the prospects for Iran's 20-year plan.  Advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri publicly lamented "wasted" human resources and asserted that skilled ministerial officials are losing their jobs - due to their political affiliations -- to "less adept allies of those in power."  "The continuation of this situation results in stagnation and a waste of human resources," Nateq-Nuri said in an interview published by the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) April 27.  3.(C) The comments by Tavakkoli and Nateq-Nuri are often echoed by IRPO contacts who claim that respected academics were forced into early retirement when Ahmadi-Nejad came to power and that skilled technocrats have frequently been sidelined to positions of less influence or ousted from their government positions all together.  One business contact alleged that many of these technocrats are relocating to Dubai. (Note.  IRPO cannot confirm this allegation but will continue to track the diaspora. Endnote)  Poverty ---------  4.(U) Majles social committee member Musa-Reza Servati said that welfare payments should increase by 15% to keep pace with inflation, "otherwise the country will face a rise in the ranks of the needy and an increase in social maladies this year." Mehr News claimed on April 28 that government assistance levels do not adequately address the needs of the poor, particularly as "soaring inflation rates lowers their standard of living every year."  The article, without citing the source of its statistics, claimed that 12 million people in Iran live below the poverty line, constituting roughly 18.5% of the population. Another six million are reportedly "not supported by any foundation or organization and thus must fend for themselves in the face of overwhelming difficulties."  (Note:  Per the Ministry of Social Welfare, anyone with an income of less than roughly $400/month lives below the poverty line and average government salaries are $300/month.  Endnote)  5.(C) Most contacts report prices are skyrocketing across the board and that wages are not keeping pace with inflation.  One Dubai-based financial analyst said the value of her house in Tehran doubled in just one year.  She noted that as prices rise, Iranians are forced to turn to inferior knock-offs, including counterfeit medical supplies.  On the other hand, an economics professor from Shiraz University recently told IRPoff that concern over inflation is severely overblown in Iran, and that current rates are consistent with the high levels of inflation seen since the revolution.  He claimed that the economic situation has not drastically changed but that expectations increased in response to Ahmadi-Nejad's campaign promise to bring oil wealth to people's tables.  The professor is the sole defender of Iran's inflation rates that IRPoff has met in recent months.  Another contact complained that Iran is turning into a welfare state, where increasingly people are opting not to work  RPO DUBAI 00000030  002.2 OF 003   if the available work is not in their field.  Foreign exchange account -------------------------------  6.(U) Majles Planning and Budget Committee member Ali Dirbaz told ISNA that "growth of liquidity and inflation is the outcome of the decisions of the past two years.  To overcome this deficiency we must stop repeating what we have done.  The current expenditures must not be financed by the foreign reserves."  7.(C) Business contacts and economists frequently complain to IRPoff of over-borrowing from the foreign exchange account (aka Oil Stabilization Fund).  One economist noted that by purchasing rials from the Central Bank of Iran with the foreign exchange funds, Ahmadi-Nejad in effect added an additional 36 percent of cash into the market that previously did not exist.  This cash, or liquidity, needs to go somewhere.  First, said the economist, people bought up all the gold; once gold prices skyrocketed, people began investing in the real estate market. (Note:  This is a single-source comment but from a historically credible source.  Endnote)  Privatization ---------------  8.(U) Despite the Supreme Leader calls February 19 for speedier privatization (reftel), it appears Iran is headed in the opposite direction.  Majles Research Center head Tavakkoli complained that the Iranian government has "chanted the slogan of privatization" the last 16 years, all the while slowly increasing the number of state-run companies.  Tavakkoli alleged that in 2004, 531 government companies were listed on the national budget, whereas that number now exceeds 2,500. Tavakkoli argues that if Iran is looking to model its economy after that of another country, it should look to China as "we must defend economic efficiency and increasing national wealth; and we must ensure social justices and the fair distribution of national wealth and national assets."  9.(C) IRPO contacts have reinforced this view.   A political science professor recently claimed to IRPoffs that despite rhetoric about privatization, the public sector in Iran has actually grown from 60 to 75%.  The Shiraz economics professor said Iranians have been hearing of privatization efforts for years and are doubtful such plans will be actualized.  Others claim, however, that talk of pending privatization has caused business slowdowns as companies slotted for privatization feel themselves to be in a holding pattern.  That said, many contacts put greater blame for slowdown in business and capital expenditure on political uncertainties as Iran's international relations deteriorate.  Way forward -----------------  10.(U) Speaking to economic students at the end of April, Expediency Council Chairman Rafsanjani implied that the Islamic Republic has not been able to implement its long-term economic policies due to the Iran-Iraq war that lasted throughout most of the 1980s.  Since 1988, Iran focused on reconstruction of the country, he said.  Now, in order to establish social welfare and increase employment opportunities, Iran should adopt a "balanced policy" to implement "incremental change" in Iran, opined Rafsanjani.  In additional to a ditente policy in foreign relations, the components of this policy include empowering the private sector, balancing the foreign exchange rate, and balancing subsidies.  11.(C) Several reformist-leaning Iranians told IRPoff that although Rafsanjani would not normally be their "first choice" for president, his ideas are logical and preferable to the policies of the current administration.  One complained that Ahmadi-Nejad does not understand economics and that his policies "don't make sense."  To illustrate his point, he said Ahmadi-Nejad raised tariffs on mobile phones from 4 to 64 percent, despite the fact that  Iran does not produce mobile phone sets locally and therefore there is no domestic product to protect.  (Note:  IRPoff was later told by another source that the tariff was put in place to assist a "connected" businessman who was having difficulty unloading mass quantities of phones he had already imported.  Endnote)  In contrast, one economist said, "Rafsanjani has power and money - now he is looking to create a legacy that will last beyond his lifetime.  The other guys (including the Supreme Leader) are too busy managing the  RPO DUBAI 00000030  003.2 OF 003   details to stay in power instead of thinking about what's good for the Iranian people."  12.(C) Comment:  The current government's economic policies have been under frequent attack, including the open letter to Ahmadi-Nejad in June 2006 in which  50 economists laid out their ten main "concerns," stating "the policies of your administration, if continued, can result in a still graver situation for the country's economy."  However, it appears that such criticism is getting more frequent and is coming from more prominent sources.  While current and possible future sanctions on Iran clearly have a chilling effect on the business climate, it is noteworthy that these Iranians put as much blame on internal economic mismanagement by the current government. Contacts previously said that as long as oil dollars are coming in, Iran's economy could float for years to come.  However, IRPoff has noticed a new level of despair and hopelessness in Iranian contacts in the past month, with some saying oil profits may not be enough to off-set Iran's economic problems.  Some Dubai-based Iranians claim that the economic situation is driving out even staunch nationalists from Iran, primarily for Dubai.  One Iranian business student - who is the son of a former high level official in Iran - first complained to IRPoff that Iranian-Americans and the media only present the negative side of Iran's economy.  However, when asked to point out something positive, he told IRPoff he could do so in 2-3 years. End Comment BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  An Iranian close to conservative circles believes former nuclear negotiator Mousavian is innocent of espionage charges but unlikely to be released soon.  Another source close to Rafsanjani thinks he will be released within days.  The first source believes Ahmadi-Nejad ordered Mousavian's arrest as an indirect hit against Rafsanjani and the think tank linked to the Expediency Council.  The source claims to have tried to find out information about Mousavian from the head of Evin Prison but was told Mousavian was being held in the section controlled by the Ministry of Intelligence.  End summary  Arrest of Mousavian -------------------  2.(S/NF) A doctor reportedly close to Iranian conservative circles told IRPO Director May 7 that he believes that former nuclear negotiator Hossein Mousavian is innocent of the charges of espionage, but he doubts Mousavian will be released soon.  In contrast, a source close to Rafsanjani --  who also believed that Mousavian was innocent -- said May 7 that he thought Mousavian would be released in a few days.  (Note: There are unconfirmed reports May 9 that Mousavian will be released on bail.  End note)  Scapegoat? ----------  3.(S/NF) The doctor believes Ahmadi-Nejad ordered Mousavian's arrest to target Rafsanjani and the Center for Strategic Research.  Because the president cannot go directly after Expediency Council head Rafsanjani, he goes after Mousavian, who is a close associate, reasoned the doctor.  The source claimed that the arrest was also designed to discredit the think tank affiliated with the Expediency Council, Center for Strategic Research, where Mousavian is the deputy head.  The center is headed by former Supreme National Security Council secretary Hojatoleslam Hassan Rowhani.  4.(S/NF) The doctor said the arrest was then initiated by the Ministry of Intelligence.  He claimed the Minister Ejei is actually "with" Rafsanjani, but because he is in Ahmadi-Nejad's cabinet, he cannot ignore the president's orders.  5.(S/NF) The doctor claimed the "facts" of the case do not add up.  The authorities claim they have been monitoring Mousavian for 2-3 years.  If this is true, he said, it does not reflect well on Iranian intelligence since Mousavian has been allowed to travel frequently outside the country.  He also claimed in true cases of espionage, the government hides the charges.  So far Mousavian has been accused of spying for the UK and Switzerland, said the doctor.  He assumes, however, that the government will later point the finger at the US, particularly given the relationship between the US and the Swiss, its protecting power in Iran.  Chilling effect ---------------  6.(S/NF) When asked if anyone were lobbying inside Iran on Mousavian's behalf, the doctor said he doubts anyone will speak up for him out of fear of being tainted.  The doctor said "everyone" in Iran is really frightened as a result of the arrest of Mousavian, the highest level Iranian official to be arrested on such serious charges in some time.  (Note: Al-Alam TV reported May 8 that Minister Ejei said two other people were summoned on the same charge as Mousavian and are under investigation.  End note)  The source said only MP Boroujerdi has raised his case publicly but without coming to his defense. (Note:  According to Fars News May 6, Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, chaired by Alaoddin Boroujerdi, summoned Intelligence Minister Ejei to brief on Mousavian's detention.

The doctor said Mousavian is being held at in the section of Evin prison run by the Ministry of Intelligence.  He claimed Mousavian's wife called him for help because he is friends with the head of Evin.  The source said when he tried to find out any information, the prison's central office told him they do not even have access to Mousavian.  The doctor assumed he is being tortured.  8.(S/NF) Comment:  We have not heard before the assertion that Ahmadi-Nejad may have ordered Mousavian's arrest to target the Center for Strategic Research, rather than just Rafsanjani himself.  If true, it raises the question of whether Rowhani will also be accused.  The second source cited who is close to Rafsanjani was very concerned about Mousavian's arrest but did not comment further on the case, other than predicting his release. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF) Summary:  An Iranian doctor, reportedly very close to conservative circles in Iran, claimed that the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba holds extremist views and wields significant influence in the Supreme Leader's office.  The doctor indicated that while Mojtaba essentially derives his power from his father's position, he is building his own power base.  The Supreme Leader allegedly has begun chemotherapy, after resisting the treatment for some time.  This is a single source account and his direct access to such information cannot be confirmed but is credible.  End summary  2.(S/NF) An Iranian doctor who reportedly is close to conservative circles in Iran, particularly former Foreign Minister Velayati, told IRPO Director May 7 that Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba plays a direct -- and negative -- role in Iranian policy-making.  The source's views on nuclear negotiator Mousavian's arrest and other views on the domestic situation to be provided septel.  Influence of Supreme Leader's son ---------------------------------  3.(S/NF) The doctor claims that Supreme Leader Khamenei's son Mojtaba is exercising real power over his father's decision-making.  The source said Mojtaba is around 33 and the third of four sons.  He claims Mojtaba is a true hardliner, a former student of Ansar-e Hizballah leader Hussein Allah Karam, although not a member of the group himself.  He reportedly studied theology but does not wear cleric's clothing.  According to the source, Mojtaba is the only son of the Supreme Leader who is active in politics.  4.(S/NF) The doctor, who describes himself as religious conservative, said Mojtaba has the type of extremist mindset that cannot be persuaded towards pragmatism.  The doctor blamed Mojtaba for much of what he saw as the negative aspects of Iran's policy.  The source gave no indication that Mojtaba's grip on power was lessening.  When IRPO director raised US certainty of Iran's assistance to groups attacking US soldiers in Iraq later in the conversation, the doctor inferred that Mojtaba is likely driving Iran's Iraq policy.  He contrasted Mojtaba with IRGC Commander Safavi, who the source believes is a much more pragmatic actor.  Power linked to father's? -------------------------  5.(S/NF) The doctor said that Mojtaba mostly derives his power from his father, and he would likely lose this power if his father departs the scene.  The doctor claimed that the Supreme Leader is now undergoing chemotherapy, after earlier refusing the treatment out of fear that people would see evidence of his illness, and that he has switched to a vegetarian diet. (Comment: One press report noted Mojtaba as a possible replacement for his father, although no contacts have mentioned this possibility.  End comment)  6.(S/NF) The doctor cautioned, however, that Mojtaba has reportedly worked to shore up his own political base over the past 10 years, installing associates from Mashhad into positions of authority (NFI).  These people reportedly remain loyal to Mojtaba and have developed "specialized" skills, making them hard to replace.  King-maker? -----------  7.(S/NF) Although Mojtaba holds no formal position, the source claimed that even ministers who go to the "Beit," as the office of the Supreme Leader is called, are deferential to Mojtaba. The doctor says the Beit suffers from the worst type of hypocrisy.  He claims Mojtaba often acts without his father's foreknowledge, but his father indulges him and protects him. Allegedly, the Supreme Leader was furious a few years ago when he learned his phone was being monitored, but when he found out his son was responsible, he let it pass.  8.(S/NF) The doctor claimed, without citing sources, that Mojtaba decided that the Beit would switch its backing to  RPO DUBAI 00000032  002.2 OF 002   Ahmadi-Nejad for president when Mojtaba could not come to an agreement with first choice candidate Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf over who would get positions in the new government.  However, Ahmadi-Nejad reportedly broke some of his promises to Mojtaba, as he has to other supporters (Note: See Ref D citing the same source.  Endnote), and the two are no longer on good terms.  The doctor also claimed that Mojtaba secured for his father-in-law Qolam Ali Haddad-Adel the position of Majles speaker, despite a lack of qualifications.  9.(S/NF) Comment:  The doctor, a supporter of the regime but a critic of Ahmadi-Nejad, clearly sees Mojtaba as a negative influence on Iranian policy.  He said that generally people in Iran accept the fact that "Aghazadeh" or sons of clerics will profit from their connections and enrich themselves in business, but Iranians are uncomfortable seeing them accrue a political role in the Islamic Republic.  We note that this is a single source report about Mojtaba Khamenei, and other contacts have not mentioned him as an important source of power in Iran.  We will pulse other contacts to check for collaboration. BURNS

Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary.  Iranians are complaining to IRPO that international pressure to isolate Iran is hurting the people more than the government.  According to anecdotal information, Iranians reportedly have difficulty opening letters of credit to import goods, including non-sensitive goods not covered by sanctions.  One former Iranian official told us that Arabs tell him the US wants to shut down all Arab-Iran trade, including foodstuffs, as well as contact with Iranian society.  Iranian businesses, as well as Emirati, are allegedly halting major construction projects in Iran, laying off thousands of employees from companies, and slowing business decisions due to political uncertainty.  An Iranian claimed she recently lost her job working for an American company in Dubai after a new "company policy" came out against employing Iranians.  An Iranian-American complains he cannot pay his US bills on-line as his US-based bank no longer allows Internet access to accounts from an Iranian internet service provider.  While it is not possible to assess the authenticity of all these claims -- and the roots of these problems are doubtless more complex than the causes cited -- the complaints are becoming common enough to document as a factor influencing Iranian public opinion.  End Summary.  2.(C) Over the last two months, IRPO contacts have repeatedly claimed that new sanctions and financial restrictions on Iran, as well as increased pressure on countries to stop "business as usual" with Iran, have had a greater negative impact on the Iranian people and "legitimate" business than on the government.  (Comment:  Reftel details how Iranians also blame their economic problems on domestic policy as well as external pressure.  End comment.)  A former high level Iranian official claimed Arabs have told him they believe the US is pushing their countries not to have any trade, business, and interaction with Iranian society -- not just with the Iranian government -- and not only asking to stop sales of sophisticated material to Iran, but also "chocolates and dry milk."  An Iranian student said his government benefits from this period of political uncertainty as it drives up oil prices, but that ordinary Iranian nationals -- both inside and outside Iran -- are suffering the consequences of new measures against Iran.  Letters of credit ------------------  3.(C) A Dubai-based Iranian financial advisor relayed a second-hand account of a Dubai-based Iranian businessman who had to fly to Taiwan to meet with banking officials after they stopped a letter of credit (LC) he had opened to export toothbrushes from China to Iran.  Reportedly, the businessman was eventually able to re-open his LC after spending "unneeded" time and money to clear up the matter.  The financial advisor also claimed that on a recent trip to Iran, she noticed that the quality of medicines and basic foodstuffs has declined as Iranian merchants turn to the black market and to "cheap Chinese knockoffs" to secure basic needs.  In her opinion, merchants are turning to the black market because it is increasingly difficult to find banks that will support letters of credit, even for legitimate trade.  One businessman in Dubai alleged in February that the cost of LCs increased on average by 3-5%.  A major Dubai-based tea trader told IRPoff that his company lowered the quality of tea exported to Iran to offset increased operating costs triggered by financial measures on Iran.  Stalled projects and lay-offs ---------------------------------  4.(C) Contacts report that the stalled business climate in this period of political uncertainty is triggering higher unemployment.  Over the past year, Iranian business owners have told IRPoffs that they have had to lay off large numbers of employees and were holding off on new investment during this period of rising international tensions.  A hotel owner complained that foreigner tourists were no longer coming to Iran, only a few foreign businesspeople, and he has had to lay off large numbers of staff.  The Iranian-American cited above said an American-educated Iranian friend of hers recently had to sell his house in Iran to buy a car to use as a taxi in order to make ends meet.  She also claimed a young US-educated family  RPO DUBAI 00000033  002.2 OF 002   friend recently overdosed on heroin after returning to Iran and not finding work.  5.(C) An Iranian-American said her brother-in-law recently had to lay off 2,000 employees in Iran after financing to develop a LNG conversion facility on Kharg Island -- northwest of the port of Bushehr -- "dried up."  She said the Iranian government was not able to finance the project.  (Note.  The contact did not indicate whether the original financing had come from a foreign source.  Endnote.)  The Iranian-American claimed that according to her relative, the private construction sector in Iran is only operating at 20% capacity and that public companies are only operating at 10% capacity.  Separately, an employee of Dubai-based Al-Futtaim Group said that the company recently suspended plans to build several branches of the French hypermarket Carrefour in Iran due to political uncertainty.  6.(C) Expat Iranians also blame USG pressure against Iran for problems they are experiencing.  An Iranian contact claimed to IRPoff that US-headquartered Emerson in Dubai terminated the employment of an Iranian friend because a new company policy did not allow it to employ Iranians.  (Note:  this claim is unconfirmed.  Endnote)  An Iranian working in Dubai complained that his real estate project in Abu Dhabi was stalled after an American company refused to sell him construction materials because he is Iranian, despite the fact that the final destination for the goods was the UAE.  (Comment:  The contact appears to come from a reputable company with a long history in the UAE; however, there could, of course, be other reasons that the US company is refraining from doing business with him.  End comment)  Impacts on Iranian account holders in US banks --------------------------------------------- ------------  7.(C) Several Iranians have complained that Bank of America reportedly no longer allows electronic bank transfers when account holders access their accounts from an Iran-based internet service provider.  An Iranian-American who travels back and forth to Tehran complained that he could not pay his California phone and water bills while in Iran.  An Iranian student at a US university told IRPoff that he fears he could default on his credit card bill while home in Iran over the summer since he will not be able to transfer funds from his Bank of America checking account to pay his US credit card.  8.(C) Comment:  We stress that these reports are anecdotal; Iranians may also be blaming outside factors for problems of bad luck, poor business practices, and bad macroeconomic policies. Nonetheless, these comments are also an indicator of the kind of "common wisdom" circulating in Iranian business circles and beyond about the impact of US-led financial measures efforts. Most of the complaints appear to center around increasing reluctance from the international community to do business with Iran rather than any concrete measure from UNSCR 1737 and 1747. Iranians also tend to lump all measures together as "sanctions," which would indicate we have more work to do on the public diplomacy front, particularly regarding what actions we are asking of other countries regarding trade with Iran, to offset the notion that we are targeting the Iranian people.  President Ahmadi-Nejad will reportedly meet with the Iranian Business Council in Dubai while in the UAE May 13-14; presumably, such business concerns will also be raised with him.  End comment.

ABU DHABI 0780, B. RPO DUBAI 0011, C. 2006 RPO DUBAI 0016  RPO DUBAI 00000035  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d) 1.(U) This cable was cleared by Embassy Abu Dhabi and ConGen Dubai.  2.(C) Summary. On the sidelines of official meetings in the UAE May 13, Iranian President Ahmadi-Nejad met with Iranian business executives in Dubai and gave a public address to a large crowd of mostly Iranians.  Ahmadi-Nejad, in a closed session for "elites," reportedly encouraged Iranian expatriates to invest in Iran and said current privatization efforts will open "avenues" for increased private sector involvement in Iran's economy. Ahmadi-Nejad then gave a speech to a crowd of reportedly up to 3,000 in an atmosphere that seemed reminiscent of his provincial political rallies.  A journalist told IRPoff that Ahmadi-Nejad handled himself "like a rock star."  He led the crowd with chants and stressed nationalist themes.  Two audience members said that despite press reports to the contrary, Ahmadi-Nejad never named the US by name but made clear insinuations about "Western oppression," "enemies," and Western reluctance to share technology with the rest of the world.  What was most striking about the visit was the authorization by the UAE to allow such a large-scale public address at a politically sensitive time by a controversial head of government.  While there is no proof, it is possible that Iran's goal was to counteract IRPO's own public outreach in Dubai.  End Summary.  3.(U) While on the first visit by an Iranian head of government to the UAE (Ref A), Iranian President Ahmadi-Nejad traveled to Dubai to meet with Iranian expatriates.  He held two events at the Iranian Social Club, which is owned by Iran's largest bonyad:  a closed session with the Iranian business community and a public address at the club's soccer stadium.  Private investment ---------------------  4.(C) Ahmadi-Nejad met with roughly 200 "Iranian elite," for about 35 minutes in the Iranian club auditorium.  According to IRNA, Ahmadi-Nejad reportedly appealed to Dubai-based businesspeople's sense of duty to Iran, inviting them to "invest in their homeland."  He predicted Iran would be the "economic power of the region in the near future."  Ahmadi-Nejad claimed that in line with Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution -- a reference to current privatization efforts (Ref B) -- "a fertile ground is being prepared for the private sector to invest in the country's major industries."  He also invited scientists and researchers living abroad to "contribute to their motherland's scientific efforts."  While none of the contacts we have pulsed so far attended the meeting, IRPoff heard anecdotally that representatives from the Al Aqili Group, a major local corporation that reportedly stalled plans to buy a private Iranian bank because of the political climate, were sitting in the front row.  Political rally ---------------  5.(C) Following the private session, the president then moved to the club soccer stadium where, according to press reports, he addressed a crowd of about 3,000.  A journalist covering the event later told IRPoff that Ahmadi-Nejad looked "like a rock star" on stage.  He wound the crowd up by asking them questions like "Are you happy to be here?", to which the crowd screamed back "Yes."   Another participant told IRPO the event resembled Ahmadi-Nejad's provincial tours in Iran.  Striking nationalist themes, Ahmadi-Nejad reportedly mesmerized the crowd with sentimental descriptions of the country's natural beauty.  He said Iran is a peaceful, loving nation that wants to share its technology and resources with the international community to make the world a better place.  One female attendee reportedly yelled out "I love you," to which Ahmadi-Nejad responded with a calm "thank you."  6.(C) In contrast to Iran's peaceful, loving nature, there are some countries that "are trying to provoke dissension among the nation of the region in a bid to dominate their wealth," IRNA quoted the president.  Repeating the same message as Supreme National Security Council Secretary Larijani gave in Dubai in December 2006 (Ref C), Ahmadi-Nejad called for regional countries to safeguard their own security.  He said the region "will leave no place for those powers to remain in the region." According to two audience members, Ahmadi-Nejad did not refer to the US by name.  He claimed "some countries" want to keep technology and progress for themselves and therefore these countries "oppose" the advancement of Iran and its "peaceful nuclear activities."  Chants of "down with the USA" and "nuclear  RPO DUBAI 00000035  002.2 OF 002   energy is our right" frequently interrupted Ahmadi-Nejad, according to the Associated Press.  7.(C) One contact asserted that she saw few people at the rally like her, meaning from the Dubai-based Iranian community.  She believed that based on the buses outside, many participants were students bused in from Iranian schools around the UAE.  She said the students were given "cakes," and the atmosphere was very festive.  Several prominent members of the Iranian community in Dubai told IRPO said they would not attend "such an event." Asked if non-Iranians attended, she claimed she saw "Palestinians" in the crowd when she saw the speech replayed on Iranian TV.  Another Iranian said he heard that tourists from Iran were brought in to supplement stadium numbers.  When IRPO Director asked an organizer of an Iranian cultural festival if she knew her event would coincide with a presidential visit, she vehemently expressed her displeasure, saying the last thing she wanted to see in the UAE was Ahmadi-Nejad.  8.(C) Comment:  The most remarkable aspect of Ahmadi-Nejad's visit was the unprecedented nature of the large rally by a visiting head of government, particularly from a country with which the UAE has such a complex relationship.  The timing -- a day after Vice President Cheney had departed the UAE -- made the event all the more surprising.  Large crowds were clearly expected; the major street in front of the club was closed to most traffic that night and attendees went through security-screening.  The event was advertised in local Farsi press as well as with posters in shop windows.  While it is not surprising that Iranian school children would be brought in to see such a historical event, we will continue to try to get a sense of who attended.  We will also report septel any readout we get of the closed session.   We do not get the sense from our contacts, however, that the visit will have any lasting consequences, either to the Iranian community or in the UAE-Iran bilateral relationship.  Iran's plea to replace the US in regional security arrangements continues to get little traction.  While we have no proof, we think the primary goal was classic public diplomacy; the president's Dubai events may even have been planned to try to counteract IRPO's own public outreach to the Iranian community here.  9.(C) Comment (continued):  The fact that no UAE officials were present at the May 14 Abu Dhabi press conference and reportedly none at the Dubai speech would seem to indicate an attempt by the UAE to distance itself from Ahmadi-Nejad's predictable rhetoric.  The UAE obviously is trying to balance its relationship with Iran, a large, powerful and economically important neighbor, with its close ties to the US.  One Embassy contact remarked today that many Emiratis saw Ahmadi-Nejad's using the UAE as a platform for such a speech as a sign of arrogance and a breach of hospitality.  They were offended by Ahmadi-Nejad's apparent assumption that he had the right to be here and that he felt little need to temper his message.  End comment. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  While we have not heard anything outside of press reporting regarding Iran's goals and strategies for the upcoming May 28 meeting with the US on Iraq, we have had some discussions with contacts regarding interlocutors and some positive and negative reactions to the idea of talks.  The choice of interlocutor will be a good indicator of who is in the driver's seat of policy right now.  The arrest of academic Haleh Esfandiari may be an effort by some to torpedo talks, although there is no sign yet from the Iranian side that they are distancing themselves from attending.  Iranian officials seem to be making major efforts to publicly justify Iran's participation, despite other signs of crackdowns on links to the US.  Iran may also see Esfandiari as a bargaining chip against the Irbil 5.  End summary  2.A.(S)  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, HAVE IRANIAN OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THEY MIGHT BE WILLING TO OFFER OR NEGOTIATE ON DURING BILATERAL TALKS WITH THE US?  WHAT WILL THEY BRING TO THE TABLE?  WHAT ISSUES WILL NOT BE DISCUSSED OR ARE RED LINES?  WHAT ISSUES WILL THEY BROACH WITHOUT HESITATION? WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TOPICS OF DISCUSSION FOR THOSE MEETINGS?  -- (U) Iranian official statements have almost uniformly asserted that the only topic for discussion with the US is Iraq, and the only reason Iran is meeting with the US is at the behest of the Iraqi government.  The Supreme Leader said May 16 that the talks would be used to "remind Washington of its failed duties in the conflict torn country."  He reiterated that Iran's policy toward the US has not changed, asking "how can one have a dialogue with an arrogant, bullying, expansionist an imperial American government, especially with its current, brazen, ill-mannered and boastful statesmen?"  In his weekly press conference May 20, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hosseini said that Iran is not linking the nuclear issue to US-Iran talks in Iraq. Official statements continue to assert that Iran will not consider discussing other topics than Iraq with the US until the US "changes its aggressive behavior" and makes "a gesture of goodwill."  It also continues to refuse to meet the precondition of suspension of enrichment necessary for talks with the P5-1.  -- (S/NF) Privately, several Iranian contacts have opined that these public statements are meant to appease hardliners who repeatedly point out that ideologically, nothing has changed between the two countries in the last 28 years.  None of our sources have claimed any insider knowledge of what Iran is likely to raise in the May 28 talks, other than the obvious issue of the detained Irbil 5.  An influential source close to Rafsanjani reportedly told a contact that he believed that the release of the five was a prerequisite to US-Iran talks on Iraq at the ministerial level.  B. (S)  WHAT TYPES OF DEBATE, IF ANY, ARE OCCURRING IN THE ELITE RANKS, THE SUPREME COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, THE EXPEDIENCY COUNCIL, OR THE CABINET ABOUT THE TALKS?  WHO IS FOR AND WHO IS AGAINST THEM?  AND WHY?  -- (S/NF) Prior to the Sharm el-Sheikh talks, the same source close to Rafsanjani told IRPO Director that contact between US and Iranian foreign ministers would break a longstanding taboo and make other kinds of US-Iran contact easier.  Given that there was a degree of exchange in Egypt, albeit not substantive, it would appear that such contact had been sanctioned at the highest level.  However, the prediction that the taboo would be broken has not borne out, as evidenced by the arrest May 8 and subsequent charges against Iranian-American academic Haleh Esfandiari for working against the Iranian government.  Her arrest, as well as other problems facing Iranian-Americans, seems designed as a message to scare Iranians off from contact with the US.  At the same time, it reflects increased paranoia over US intentions toward the regime.  However, it cannot be discounted that the Iranian government may try to see Esfandiari mostly as a bartering chip for the Irbil 5, a view echoed by several contacts.  Another indication of crackdowns on interaction with the US, a group of Iranian documentary filmmakers planning to travel to the US on an IVLP visit was recently hauled into the Ministry of Culture and advised to turn down the invitation or face "difficulties."  C. (S)  WHO DOES IRAN PLAN TO SEND TO THE TALKS?  WHAT ROLE, IF ANY, WILL AHMADI-NEJAD HAVE?  RAFSANJANI?  LARIJANI?  WHO WITHIN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WILL DETERMINE ATTENDANCE AT THE TALKS?   RPO DUBAI 00000036  002.2 OF 003   -- (U) The Iranian government has not publicly confirmed who will represent Iran in the Baghdad talks.  A May 21 Mehr News article claims the Iranian Foreign Ministry intends to send its UN PermRep Mohammed-Javed Zarif to lead the talks.  Previous Iranian press pieces had speculated that the current Iranian Ambassador to Iraq Amir Sa'eed Iravani, Supreme National Security Council Undersecretary Mohammed Jafari or former Iranian Ambassador to Iraq Kazemi Qomi would head the delegation.  -- (C) There appears to be division inside the government over who will be the Iranian interlocutor with the US -- as evidenced by the delay in the announcement -- which would indicate a power struggle over what camp gets the "credit."  In all likelihood, the decision will be the Supreme Leader's.  The appointment of Zarif would make sense in terms of his experience in dealing with the US, but it would be surprising in light of long-term efforts by Ahmadi-Nejad to sideline him for being too much in the pragmatic camp.  Such a choice would suggest that Ahmadi-Nejad has little influence on the decision.  -- (S/NF) We heard more from contacts about the issue of who should represent the US in talks at the ministerial level than at the ambassadorial level.  One conservative contact close to former FM Velayati claimed the reason that there was no Secretary Rice-FM Mottaki meeting at Sharm El-Sheikh was because  SIPDIS it was decided that Mottaki was not the right interlocutor.  The contact called Mottaki weak, in contrast to his predecessors FM Velayati and Kharrazi who he said were policy advisors as well as implementers.  The source claimed that Ahmadi-Nejad had chosen Mottaki to be his "puppet."  -- (S/NF) We have heard speculation that Velayati may be selected to conduct talks, but it is not clear whether that would only be for talks at the ministerial level or also ambassadorial.  One source recently returned from Iran said there is discussion of creating a new position for Velayati within the government, possibly to prepare him to "take over," but the source close to Velayati had reportedly told him he was doubtful that Velayati would agree to join Ahmadi-Nejad's government.  The same source also told IRPO Director that Velayati plans to run for president in 2009 but will wait to see the results of the 2008 Majles elections before declaring his candidacy.  -- (S) One source recently claimed that Supreme National Security Council Secretary Larijani is in a relatively weak position within the government (and that one of his brothers -- not clear which one but presumably Mohammad-Javad Larijani -- was more influential than him).  Larijani was described as independent from both the Ahmadi-Nejad group and the Rafsanjani group.  D. (S)  WHAT WILL THEIR MARCHING ORDERS BE?  WHAT DIRECTIVES WILL THE PARTICIPANTS BE GIVEN AND WILL THEY HAVE ANY LATITUDE TO NEGOTIATE?  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, BESIDES IRAQ ARE THE PARTICIPANTS PREPARED TO DISCUSS? WHAT PREPARATIONS FOR FOLLOW-ON TALKS, IF ANY, ARE IRANIAN LEADERS MAKING?  --(U) In the only public comment we have seen indicating willingness to broaden the agenda, Secretary of the Human Rights Headquarters of Iran's Judiciary Mohammad-Javad Larijani said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Jordan May 22 that it is possible that Iranian and US officials could discuss "issues related to Iran" while in Baghdad.  While reiterating to IRNA that the talks are being held at the request of Iraqi officials on Iraq only, he did not dismiss the possibility of broadening the discussions if "Washington shows good will."  E. (S)  WHAT ARE IRANIAN LEADERS SAYING ABOUT THEIR GOALS AND CONCERNS VIS-A-VIS US ENGAGEMENT?  WHAT ARE THEIR PERCEPTIONS ABOUT US INTENTIONS FOR THE TALKS?  WHY ARE IRANIAN LEADERS INTERESTED IN HOLDING DIALOGUE NOW?  -- (U) Iranian officials in their public statements are framing their agreement to attend the talks as a sign of their good will and intentions towards Iraqis and a sign of US weakness.  As reported by PressTV, Foreign Minister Mottaki told Jordan's King Abdullah May 20 that Iran "will be seeking the correction of wrong policies the US has adopted in Iraq when the two countries sit down."  --(S/NF) Iranians have long asserted that one of the main obstacles to talks with the US is the issue of who will get credit for eventual reestablishment of ties.  The contact close to Velayati recently claimed to IRPO Director that President  RPO DUBAI 00000036  003.2 OF 003   Ahmadi-Nejad's status is weakening and that his only chance of being reelected in 2009 is opening relations with the US.  This source claimed that Ahmadi-Nejad's personal ambition would triumph over his ideological opposition to dealing with the US. The same source also claimed Rafsanjani's relative strength has grown over the past five months.  Subsequent to this conversation, former nuclear negotiator Mousavian was arrested, and we heard that his arrest made others, including Velayati and Rafsanjani, very nervous.  This would indicate they do not believe themselves to be untouchable.  Public perceptions ------------  3.(S/NF) At the popular level, prior to the Iraq conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, we heard there was lots of excitement in Iran about prospects of Rice-Mottaki meeting, with people handing out sweets to celebrate.  Regarding the Baghdad talks, people seem to believe both governments' statements that the content will be restricted to Iraq, but some Iranians say they see these talks as a first step toward better relations.  The source close to Velayati told IRPO Director that most in the Iranian government are dying for a green light from US on engagement, motivated in part by the very bad state of economy.  We heard indirectly that a major Bazaari leader, reportedly close to the Supreme Leader and an informal advisor to Ahmadi-Nejad, said Iran should have relations with the US.  4.(C) A negative note about the talks was struck by several civil society activists, who indicated to IRPoffs concern that if talks led to political deals between US and Iran, the US would drop the subject of human rights and democratic reform in Iran.  5.(C) Comment:  Facing growing international pressure and increased blame by its own population for its economic and political problems, the government may see in talks on Iraq with the US a way to deflect domestic and international criticism and project a more pragmatic image.  It may hope that positive traction in talks will help forestall stepped-up UNSC sanctions against it.  It may also genuinely hope that such talks will lead to broader engagement.  However, the charges against Esfandiari could indicate an effort by opponents in Iran to torpedo any kind of engagement with the US.  The arrest very likely indicates Iran will continue its internal crackdown on civil society and view with suspicion any links with the US -- other than any in which it directly participates.

RPO DUBAI 0015, B. RPO DUBAI 0033  RPO DUBAI 00000037  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  As of May 22, the price of gasoline in Iran was increased 25% to roughly 10 cents per liter, and gasoline purchases will only be allowed with "smart cards." Iran's Interior Minister Pour Mohammadi said that gasoline rationing would begin "early June," based on a quota system that will be announced by the cabinet "within days."  However, one contact who claimed to have worked on the smart card project said recently that the country lacks the communication structure to fully implement a fuel-card system.  The government has been threatening to decrease gasoline subsidies for years, which constitutes a huge drain on the annual budget, but until now failed to take this unpopular step.  Some contacts opine that President Ahmadi-Nejad made the tough decision in the face of a feared embargo against refined gasoline imports.  In the view of one Iranian expat economist, cutting off Iran's gasoline supply would be the only way to "get to the government," but at the same time, he was concerned over repercussions for the Iranian people.  He claimed that the government is actually "benefiting" from the current atmosphere of sanctions and international pressure and that it thrives under "crisis conditions."  The people are already bearing the brunt of the burden, he said. While we agree a cut-off of gasoline would have an immediate impact on the Iranian government, we would argue that it is better for the increasingly unpopular Ahmadi-Nejad government to be seen as the cause of increasing prices and decreasing supplies. End Summary  Gasoline prices rise and rationing on tap -----------------------------------------  2.(S) In a joint statement May 22, the Minister of Oil and the Minister Interior announced that gasoline prices rose 2 cents per liter, or roughly 25% to 10 cents per liter.  In addition, Iranian must now use a "smart card" to purchase gasoline.  They said that "all filling stations have been equipped with smart card systems and more than 90 percent of stations have become operational."  Pour Mohammadi told reporters that once all smart cards were distributed - within 10-15 days - "rationing would take affect."  While the cabinet has yet to announce the rationing system, the Interior Minister said "for the current year, two quotas have been determined for every five months." Presumably, the rationing would be controlled by the smart card, but according to an IRPO contact - who claimed to have been the consultant for the project - the country still lacks the communication infrastructure to take full advantage of a fuel-card system.  Why ration now? ---------------  3.(S) In a discussion with IRPoff, one Iranian expat economist said that the Iranian government has been "threatening to implement some sort of gasoline rationing system for years." This had presumably not been done, he said, because domestically it is very unpopular, particularly for a president like Ahmadi-Nejad who sells himself as a populist.  The Iranian government's current efforts to reduce gasoline consumption are probably in part to protect itself from a possible boycott and in part to decrease the money spent on subsidies (ref A). Depending on the rationing scheme set to be announced in the next 1-2 weeks, lowering fuel consumption could lessen the impact that any future gasoline boycott would have on the Iranian economy.  Current estimates suggest that Iran imports roughly 40% of its gasoline needs.  (Note:  Further complicating the situation is the reportedly high levels of gasoline then smuggled out of the country.  The consultant for the smart card project claimed to IRPO Director that his research indicated that two thirds of gasoline purchased by the gasoline stations he tracked ended up somewhere else other than the gas pump.  He said that when he presented his research to the Ministry of Oil, they asked him not to publicize these findings.  He claimed that the IRGC and others are likely involved in smuggling.  End note)  An advocate for gasoline embargo --------------------------------  4.(S) The Iranian economist told IRPoff that President Ahmadi-Nejad only thinks about the economy when he is "forced to" under pressure, and that economic liberalization and growth are not a goal of the current administration.  He repeated the complaints of  other contacts that after the new administration  RPO DUBAI 00000037  002.2 OF 002   sidelined experts in the ministries, it lost the "capacity" to shape long-term economic policies.  Instead, he said, decision-making is reactionary.  The government tends to operate in crisis mode, and it applies short-term band-aids to long-term problems.  He predicted the government would continue to use oil dollars to bankroll short-sighted economic policies that are appealing to the public but not good for the long-term economic health of the country -- as long as it is "allowed to do so." The economist opined that oil dollars "cushion" the impact of the international sanctions for the government and that the consumers pay the increased costs associated with doing business with Iran (ref B).  5.(S) The economist asserted - though with great hesitancy - that the only way to "hurt" the government would be to impose a gasoline embargo on Iran.  At the same time, he recognized that such an act would be very detrimental to the Iranian people.  He also predicted that critics of the West inside Iran would use such a move as "proof" that the West was lying when it claimed that its sanctions were designed not to hurt the Iranian people.  Nonetheless, the economist argued for an embargo because he believed that the financial pressure against Iran to date actually benefited the current government and its policy of isolationism.  He said the only way to "force" the reactionary, crisis-driven Ahmadi-Nejad government to change its behavior would be to put it in a position where it has no choice.  6.(S) Comment:  It is clear that a sudden cut-off of gasoline imports to Iran - if enforceable - would cause an immediate effect in a country that is importing almost half of its gasoline needs.  However, it may not yield the desired effects. We have noted that contacts of all ages are increasingly blaming their country's political and economic difficulties more on their own government and less on external pressures.  If true, a gasoline boycott that caused immediate pain among ordinary people could reverse this trend.  It is preferable that the apparently increasingly unpopular Ahmadi-Nejad government directly takes the hit for higher prices and reduced supply of gasoline in Iran, not the international community.

There is more support now in Iran for talks with the US than ever before, despite opposition from some pockets based on ideological and economic grounds, said an Iranian political scientist to IRPO Director May 24.  The academic claimed that a "successful" US-Iran meeting would require a deliverable for the Iranian side in order to avoid attacks back home but was less clear on what Iran was prepared to deliver.  The political scientist opined that agreement on the MEK or the Irbil 5 would be optimal but that a positive statement by the US government after the meeting would likely suffice.  The academic said it is possible that the recent spat of arrests of Iranian-Americans may be an attempt from one camp to kill the talks.  He predicted that Haleh Esfandiari would be released soon.  He reasoned the government will not want to further provoke the Iranian elite, who hold her in high regard, an argument than sounds more hopeful than realistic.  End Summary.  Upcoming US-Iran talks - Why now? --------------------------------------------- --  2.(S/NF)  An Iranian political scientist discussed May 24 the upcoming US-Iran talks, the case of Halah Esfandiari, and internal political dynamics (latter subject to be reported septel) with IRPO Director.  The academic opined that there is more support now in Iran than ever before for talking with the US.  He indicated there was a wider realization within the government that only through the US can Iran resolve its security and economic issues.  Talking to Europe will get it nowhere.  Plus, the Iranian government has seen that US seriousness in its threat of a military strike - although it does not think the US would likely strike at the present time. It has also seen US resolve in confronting Iran in Iraq and forging an international coalition leading to UN Security Council resolutions.  Iran would prefer to avoid a third resolution, he said, for the psychological impact it would have at home.  In addition, he said, the Iranian government understands that its people want ties with the US and international links.  In particular, he said, the Iranian people see interaction with the US as the key to modernization.  The academic claimed that the Iranian people as a whole are very pro-American and still believe that - unlike European countries - the US can resolve the problems in the region.  Suspicions of both UK and Russian intentions still run high, he said.  For instance, he claimed that Iran would never seize US soldiers like it did the British soldiers because the Iranian public will believe Brits were acting illegally but would be less likely to believe this of Americans.  3.(S/NF) As much as you can dislike President Ahmadi-Nejad's politics, said the professor, he presents a "new" opportunity for progress in bilateral relations because unlike his predecessor, Khatami, he is not afraid of anything.  If he wants to do something, he will.  No other president has written letters to a US president, for instance.  Nonetheless, he said, there remain some in Iran opposed to talks with the US -- either for ideological grounds or because they profit economically from the status quo -- who may try to torpedo any new openings.  He acknowledged this could be one motivation for the recent spat of arrests of Iranian-Americans, but also said that the government is truly afraid of efforts to orchestrate a velvet revolution there and seeks to intimidate its populace through arrests and crackdowns like the current one on bad hijab.  4.(S/NF) The academic opined that in order for the talks to continue and to succeed, the Iranians must leave the meeting with some kind of deliverable.  Otherwise, hardliners opposed to talks will attack them for betraying national interests.  He said there is great concern about a rerun of Afghanistan, in which Iranians believe their "complete" cooperation with the US on Afghanistan was rewarded by the Axis-of-Evil designation. The academic thought this was why there was no meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Mottaki in Sharm el-Sheikh. He said politicians are frightened for the sake of their careers to go back to Tehran empty-handed.  5.(S/NF) When pressed by IRPoff to define what Iranians would  RPO DUBAI 00000038  002.2 OF 002   call a deliverable, the academic said that an agreement on the Mujahhadin-e Khalq (MEK) or release of the so-called Irbil 5 would be optimal, but he realized that this may be too much to expect from a first meeting.  He added that there is complete realism on the Iranian side that resolution to a major issue like the nuclear issue is not achievable from such a meeting. The political scientist said that a positive statement from the US government about the May 28 meeting after its conclusion - preferably from the highest level -- would likely suffice for a first meeting.  He maintained that positive statements from the US on Iran get the largest number of hits on Iranian news websites, such as Baztab.  He added that such a statement could also touch on other areas, such as a restatement that the US wanted to resolve the nuclear issue diplomatically, even though the talks were focused solely on Iraq.  6.(S//NF) Asked whether the Iranian government continues to view the MEK is a real threat, he answered not in its current state but it could be if it got a new foreign backer.  He repeated what all of our contacts say - that the MEK are seen as traitors in Iran for their cooperation with Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.  On the Irbil 5, the academic said the fact that their families had been given permission to see the detainees had been viewed positively in Iran as an indication that the US was looking to resolve this issue.  When asked, he said the Iranian people see the detainees as an important issue and would be happy to see it resolved.  7.(S/NF) When asked what kind of deliverable Iran could give the US in talks, the academic was vaguer.  He said that the sight of the US and Iran working together could help Iraqi PM Maliki enforce greater security in Iraq and that Iran could use its influence with Shia groups.  He maintained that Iran's primary goal in Iraq was national security, not religious interests. Above all, he said, Iran wanted to ensure that future Iraqi governments will not threaten Iran as Saddam Hussein's government had.  When asked how to address Arab concerns about a US-Iran meeting on Iraq, he essentially said that Arab countries should come to grips with reality.  He maintained that Iran is not a threat to the region but that at the same time, as long as there is instability in the Middle East, Iran will see an opportunity for itself to play a role.  The way to preempt Iran, indicated the academic, was for the US and Arabs to work to resolve the conflicts.  8.(S/NF) The political scientist called on the US not to lose the support of the Iranian people.  He repeated what we hear from many - though not all - contacts.  He maintained that the Iranian people remain largely pro-US, but that a US attack would cause the Iranian people to turn against the US and rally around their government.  He maintained that Iranians are just trying to make the best of their situation and that they have no taste for upheaval, either brought about by external or internal forces.  9.(S/NF) Comment:  The academic, who knows Haleh Esfandiari, said he believed she would be released soon.  He said that, compared to Ramin Jahanbegloo, Esfandiari has much closer ties to Iranian academics and their deep respect.  He reasoned that the Iranian government would not want to risk the anger from the Iranian elite that holding her for very long would engender. This view seems somewhat naove, given that the government never had the support of the Iranian elite and it seems unlikely it would care about alienating them further, but we hope his prediction comes true.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  In two low-key meetings on Iran scheduled at Senator Lieberman's request in Dubai May 29, the Senator heard different views from three Dubai-based Iranian private citizens.  All three were critical of the regime, particularly of President Ahmadi-Nejad, and all three had different views of how the US should approach Iran.  Sanctions against Iran are having an impact; particularly on private business, said a Dubai-based Iranian businessman.  Unfortunately, he said, the private business sector in Iran does not have the power to pressure the government to change policy.  All three Iranian interlocutors -- the businessman, a marketer, and a consultant -- all agreed that President Ahmadi-Nejad is a "puppet" of the Supreme Leader and that the majority of Iranian people do not support him.  They disagreed, however, on a way forward.  The two who have lived outside Iran since the revolution called on the US to adopt a more confrontational policy, with one saying the US needs to "push the Iranians to the wall" to force change and advocated a "full-court press" to do so, including attacking Iran's nuclear facilities.  The consultant - who moved from Iran to Dubai four years ago - said in contrast that Iranian people want reform but are "tired" of upheaval.  The Senator also heard conflicting views on whether the US should talk to Iran, with one Iranian calling the May 28 US-Iran Baghdad talks mere "tactics" on the part of the Iranian government to try to derail future sanctions and another stating that it was "good signal."  After the meeting, we indicated to the Senator that in general, few Iranians living in Iran tell us they advocate military action against Iran.  On the other hand, we commonly hear Ahmadi-Nejad described as a puppet and as increasingly unpopular, though we note that most Iranians we meet tend to be from the elite.  End Summary.  2.(S) In response to a request from Senator Lieberman's office, IRPO arranged two meetings with three Iranian residents in Dubai May 29.  One was arranged informally through the Iranian Business Council (IBC) but only two people, the businessman and a consultant, agreed to come to what was obviously a sensitive meeting.  The businessman has lived outside Iran since the revolution; the consultant only came to Dubai from Iran four years ago.  In the second meeting with an Iranian/green card holder, the other planned participant - an Iranian businessman from Tehran - backed out.  The LPR is a marketer, whose father was a high-level diplomat under the Shah; he has lived outside Iran since the revolution.  In the first meeting, the two discussed terrorism, sanctions, and the Baghdad talks with the Senator.  In the second meeting, the marketer introduced himself as a "proud, passionate Persian" and focused on historical events that led us to current US-Iranian relations.  The Senator was accompanied by three staff members, joined by three officers from the Iran Regional Presence office.  Impact of Sanctions -------------------------  3.(S) All three Iranians agreed that US unilateral actions taken against Iranian banks and UN resolutions 1737 and 1747 are impacting business in and with Iran.  The Iranian consultant indicated that this has led to more Iranians relocating their business to Dubai.  He claimed that two years ago there were 6,300-6,500 Iranian businesses - registered as Emirati companies in Dubai - and now that number has jumped to 8,200.  The consultant said sanctions were "making trouble for the Iranian people."  The Iranian businessman thought the policy of imposing sanctions on Iran was the correct one, saying however that sanctions are not the only tool, inferring support for military action.  When asked if the sanctions could lead to effective pressure on the regime, he said it is not "realistic to think businessmen can change the government," saying private sector business has little lobbying power in Iran.  He said Supreme Leader Khamenei is focused solely on preserving his power, and is not involved in business.  The Supreme Leader "does not care about" money and business.  When pressed by Lieberman, however, the businessman admitted that the Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and the Ministry of Information (MOIS) are "active" in business and may pressure the government as international pressure impacts their interests.  The Iranian marketer agreed with sanctions, despite noting that inflation, due in part to increased costs of business, "is killing the people."  Ahmadi-Nejad: a Puppet  RPO DUBAI 00000039  002.2 OF 003   ----------------------  4.(S) In both meetings, the Iranians described President Ahmadi-Nejad as a "puppet" of the Supreme Leader.  The businessman claimed that the majority of Iranians do not like the president.  He believed that ballots were manipulated in the 2005 presidential election and said that he would "respect" the president more if he thought that Ahmadi-Nejad was "fairly" elected and had really received 17 million votes.  He claimed that Rafsanjani was not allowed to win, as he would not have "danced with the music of the Supreme Leader."  Baghdad security talks ----------------------  5.(S) The Senator heard both praise and criticism of the US-Iran talks in Baghdad the previous day.  The marketer thought they were a "good signal," whereas the businessman called them "foolish" and said the US should not talk to the "enemy."  He maintained that to stop terrorism in Iraq, you should fight by rules of terrorists and show no mercy.  The businessman told the Senator that he believed Iran agreed to talk to the US on Iraq merely as a "tactic" to try to forestall further sanctions.  He maintained that the Iranian government has no interest in seeing a stable, democratic Iraq next door.  He discounted religion as Iran's primary motivator in Iraq, saying the government was more concerned that a democratic success story next door would lead to increased pressure for reform from the Iranian people.  The businessman believed the US should remain in Iraq and told the Senator he thought it was unwise for US Democrats to oppose the President's Iraq policy.  Terrorism ---------  6.(S) The Iranian businessman criticized US tactics in the Global War on Terrorism as too lenient.  He warned that if the United States is not successful in confronting terrorism, Hizballah will take over Lebanon within five years and soon thereafter, there would be "no more Kuwait, and no more Saudi Arabia."  He said that terrorist know the "worst" that will happen if they get caught by the US is "a trial and three meals a day."   The businessman claimed that terror had become a business in Iraq.  He claimed people were carrying out attacks purely for financial gain and were paid one sum per Iraqi death, and a much higher amount per American death.  Who's to blame --------------  7.(S) The marketer, like most Iranians we meet, blamed the British for the problems in the region, including Iran.  He maintained that all the problems that the US is currently trying to address in the region were caused by bad decisions by the British over the past 70 years.  He also repeated the frequent claim that the mullahs of Iran are directly linked to the British government and benefit from US' absence from the political scene in Iran.  The businessman, on the other hand, blamed the US for both the fall of the Shah and for the triumphant return of Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran, which he claimed also occurred with the backing of the Palestinians.  The way forward ---------------  8.(S) The Iranian marketer claimed that Expediency Council Chairman Rafsanjani and former Majles speaker Karroubi recently petitioned the Supreme Leader to "get us out of this mess," which he understood to mean the international pressures Iran was facing.  He said he did not know how the Supreme Leader responded.  The marketer said the mullahs only want political recognition from the US and claimed that the detention of Iranian-Americans was a cry for recognition.  While he believed that Iran "would give everything in exchange" for recognition, he opposed dealing with the Islamic government.  He said he envisions a future Iran "without a suffix or a prefix," meaning no longer an Islamic government.  9.(S) Both the businessman and the marketer - both longtime expats - advocated a confrontational approach towards Iran, including a military attack.  The consultant, a recent imigri, held a different view, saying the Iranian people were tired of chaos, did not want a return to the uncertainty that accompanied the revolution, and wanted reform from within.  The marketer  RPO DUBAI 00000039  003.2 OF 003   said that after "70 years of the British footprint" in the region, effecting real change will be a formidable challenge for the US.  He said one way to pressure the Iranian government would be to maneuver it into closing the Straight of Hormuz by bombing its nuclear sites.  He reasoned that with no oil revenues, "the mullahs would be gone in 12 weeks."  10.(S) Senator Lieberman asked if, given Iran's economic woes and the people's discontent with the current leadership, there was any likelihood the people would rise up against the regime. The businessman replied no and likened the Iranian government to Saddam's regime, stating hardliners would not allow the people to press for reform.  The consultant thought change would come gradually and predicted that the next round of elections may result in the return of Khatami and/or Rafsanjani, with more moderate policies.  11.(S) Comment:  Iranians occasionally tell us they would support a US military campaign against Iran to forcibly remove their government, but the majority tell us they would oppose such a step.  We would assert that the fact that two out of three of Senator Lieberman's interlocutors favored military action was due to two factors, which we discussed later with the Senator:  only those with very strong anti-IRIG sentiments would take the risk of meeting a US senator in Dubai, and both had lived outside of Iran for over two decades.  The views of most Iranians living in Iran with whom we talk reflect more the views of the consultant - that change should come peacefully and from within.  Senator Lieberman appeared to take away from the meetings a view we share - that there is no consensus among Iranians on a way forward.  12.(U) Senator Lieberman's office did not have the opportunity to clear this cable.

He said there is currently a run on private banks in Tehran by account holders who believe the banks will not survive with the lower rates.  The businessman said Al Aqili's tobacco business in Iran has gone to JTI (Note:  JTI is a Japan Tobacco and RJRI - the international operation of RJ Reynolds - conglomerate.  Endnote)  He claimed that JTI's operations in Iran are controlled by the "Lebanese mafia" and that its tobacco profits are funding terrorism in Iraq.  He did not offer any proof to back up this claim, only advising that we should follow the network of JTI's distributors, claiming they were all Iraqis.  In general, the businessman claimed that corruption is on the rise in Iran in response to political uncertainty.  While this is an unconfirmed single source cable -- from an individual who would naturally have an axe to grind with JTI -- Al Aqili's saga demonstrates that the Iranian government continues to deter foreign investment through its own actions.  End Summary.  Al Aqili's business in Iran ----------------------------  2.(S) IRPOffs met June 3 with an Iranian businessman who said that he was involved in managing UAE-based Al Aqili Group's tobacco distribution network in Iran for six years.  The businessman said Al Aqili faced multiple challenges when it initially began distributing tobacco in Iran as it was the first foreign distributor in the IRI.  In the beginning, police regularly arrested the company's local distributors and seized Al Aqili shipments, as it was not widely known that a foreign operator could legally distribute cigarettes.  After a few rough years, the businessman said tobacco distribution in Iran turned into an annual $300 million industry for Al Aqili.  3.(S) The company's prospects in Iran took a negative turn roughly six months ago.  According to the businessman, Al Aqili apparently alienated itself when it purchased Iran Khodro's 25% share of Parsian Bank, a private Iranian bank.  The businessman claimed that while Al Aqili was in negotiations to buy the shares, former Intelligence Minister Mohammad Reshahri approached Parsian Bank about purchasing the shares.  The managing director of Parsian Bank reportedly told Reshahri to "go away," saying he should have approached Iran Khodro and not the bank if he had wanted to negotiate the price of the shares. The businessman inferred that Reshahri must have used his influence against Al Aqili, since soon thereafter; Ahmadi-Nejad publicly criticized foreign investment in Parsian Bank.  4.(S) After Ahmadi-Nejad's criticism, Al Aqili was forced to return its shares of Parsian Bank to Iran Khodro, according to the businessman, although it is still waiting for its initial $60 million investment to be returned.  In addition, Al Aqili reportedly lost its license to distribute tobacco in Iran.  An April 16, 2007 Baztab article referred to the annulment of the "biggest private sector transaction at Tehran Stock Exchange" to date in which 28.8% of Parsian shares - a $320 million investment -- were transferred from a "government affiliated auto-making company" to private-buyer Mohammad Rostami Safa and a "Dubai-based Iranian partner."  According to the Baztab article, "a stock exchange official told the press that the transaction had been annulled because of administrative irregularities."  5.(S) When asked if Al Aqili spoke to Ahmadi-Nejad about the issue during his May 13 visit to Dubai (reftel), the businessman said Al Aqili did not get the meeting it requested with Ahmadi-Nejad.  He believed, however, that UAE officials likely raised Al Aqili's case in their own bilateral discussions with Ahmadi-Nejad.  6.(S) According to the businessman, Al Aqili still retains a presence in Iran --  two tobacco manufacturing facilities, a cement factory, and a smaller-scale foodstuff and consumable distribution network -- although the foodstuff and distribution network is operating at a loss.  The businessman said Al Aqili  RPO DUBAI 00000041  002.2 OF 002   hopes to eventually export out of Iran, but he did not specify which products.  He also mentioned that Al-Aqili does significant business distributing tobacco in Iraq and has a presence in 22 cities.  JTI's business profits funding terrorism? --------------------------------------------- ---  7.(S) When asked who made up for the tobacco demand previously met by Al Aqili, the businessman said "JTI."  (Note:  JTI was created in 1999 when Japan Tobacco purchased RJRI - the international operation of RJ Reynolds.  Endnote)  The businessman claimed that JTI in Iran is controlled by "Lebanese mafia;" he alleged that the company's Iraqi directors in Iran are funneling the company's profits to support terrorism in Iraq.  When asked to specify which groups JTI was allegedly funding in Iraq, the businessman merely said "trace the history of their distributors."  He acknowledged that the IRGC likely also had a hand in smuggling cigarettes into Iran but indicated that JTI controlled a much more significant share of the tobacco market.  Iran's investment climate -----------------------------  8.(S) When asked by IRPoffs about the contradictory nature of Ahmadi-Nejad's condemnation of  foreign investment in Parsian Bank, and other more recent statements by Iran's Money and Credit Council encouraging foreign investment in the banking sector, the businessman snidely remarked that with the lowering of interest rates, foreign banks "would not invest in Iran anyway."  (Note:  Ahmadi-Nejad recently forced all public and private banks to set borrowing rates at 12%.  State banks had been set at 14% and private banks were offering rates of 17-28%.  End note)  He said that the government order to lower interest rates has scared the customers of private banks, who worry that the banks won't remain solvent.  This has reportedly led to a real "run" on the banks.  The businessman also predicted another spike in real estate prices as individuals pull their money out of banks.  He maintained that corruption is on the rise in Iran, due to the current uncertainty in Iran.  He said that because people do not know if they will still have their jobs tomorrow, they are "looking to get the most of their positions today."  9.(S) Comment.  This is a single source cable from a new IRPO contact and the veracity of the statements cannot be verified. His comments about JTI are noteworthy but should be caveated as coming from the company's direct business competitor.  What Al Aqili's saga does demonstrate, however, is that the Iranian government is often more effective than any kind of external pressure in scaring off foreign investment. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  Dubai is one of the main centers of the Iranian diaspora both in terms of sheer numbers and presence in the business community.  Iranian immigrants, both those who came before and after the Islamic Revolution, have played a significant role in Dubai's economic success, according to Emirati and Iranian contacts.   Dubai continues to be receptive to Iranian expatriates, who work in all fields of business. However, bilateral tensions and growing international pressure on Iran have brought complications for the business community in Dubai.  End summary.  2.(C) Iranians, mostly merchants, were among the first foreigners to set up business in the UAE, according to the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).  The Dubai market has been primarily oriented toward Iran since the 1950s when Iran had the region's most dynamic economy.  Dubai Ruler Sheikh Rashid offered these Iranians incentives such as free land, personal protection, and exemption from import and export duties.  With Iran's economic downturn and political isolation after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Dubai has continued to play a critical role as a re-export hub for Iran.  This cable focuses on Iran's business presence in the UAE; a sociological look at the diaspora community is reported septel.  3.(U) Situated less than 100 miles across the Persian Gulf, the UAE is Iran's largest trading partner.  Dubai in particular serves as an outlet for Tehran's business with the outside world, with goods going back and forth on large ships and traditional dhows.  The DCCI claims that in 2006, Dubai-Iran non-oil trade was worth about $8 billion (presumably including both exports and re-exports, although the source does not clarify) while total Iran-Dubai trade exchanges amounted to about $11 billion.  As reported in local press, the Iranian consulate in Dubai stated that UAE-wide exports and re-exports to Iran totaled $7 billion in 2006, and Iranian exports to the UAE $3 billion, expected to increase to $3.5 billion in 2007. The article cites the Iranian commercial attachi saying that Iran exports machinery and heavy equipment, fruits and vegetables, processed food, building materials, and petrochemical products to the UAE.  At the end of 2006, accumulated assets of Iranians in Dubai were estimated at $300 billion, according to Iranian government-run news agency ISNA.  Prominent Iranians in Dubai ---------------------------  4.(C//NF) Many Iranian business families in Dubai have achieved prominent status, but it is the older expats who are best known to the general community, even though they are now Emirati citizens.  Some have crossed over into the UAE government, including cabinet positions.  Influential Iranian families, such as Galadari, Gargash, Al Aqili, and Rafiqdost own multiple businesses and investments, and exemplify the business opportunities available in Dubai.  The Galadari family, although now suffering some setbacks (as evidenced by the Dubai government assuming control over their newspaper, the Khaleej Times) has a long history of enterprise and commercial activity dating from the 1940s.  Originally from the city of Galadar in Iran, the three Galadari brothers built some of Dubai's first modern hotels, including the Intercontinental and Hyatt Regency in the mid-1970s, and one of Dubai's major roundabouts is named after Abdul Wahab Galadari, based on the location of his landmark car dealership, "Galadari Motors."  Abdul Wahab Galadari also founded the Gulf Times Newspaper and one of his sons was the editor of Khaleej Times.  Today, another one of the Galadari sons, Issam, is the managing director of Emaar International Developers, which is building Burj Dubai, planned to be the world's new tallest skyscraper.  Also, big families such as Al Aqili have significant trade ties to the US and to Iran, although Al Aqili has reportedly suffered setbacks in its investments in Iran (ref A).  Scattered in all fields -----------------------  5.(C//NF) Today, Iranians in Dubai are engaged in a wide range of business activities in Dubai and do not seem to be concentrated in specific business sectors.  The Iranian  RPO DUBAI 00000042  002.2 OF 002   government has a trade center in Dubai that holds international business gatherings, and the independent Iranian Business Council (IBC) operates to promote local Iranian businesses. According to a January 2007 Middle East Online article, the DCCI said 8,050 Iranian companies are registered in Dubai, while the Iranian Business Council puts the numbers closer to 10,000. (Note: Businesses in Dubai outside of free zones need to be at least 51% locally owned; inside free zones can be 100% foreign owned. End note.)  Other Iranians work as teachers, professors, bank officials, and doctors.  Many local police are Emiratis of southern Iranian/Baluchi origin.  For example, probably a quarter of the rotating group of police at the Dubai World Trade Center building, the Consulate General's location, speak a Lari dialect of Farsi, some through their heritage.  Also, some older Emiratis speak limited Farsi from the old days when Farsi was the language of the local bazaar.  Iranian government interest ---------------------------  6.(C//NF) The Iranian government has two major areas of interest regarding the Iranian Dubai business community:  reversing capital outflow from Iran to redirect investment into Iran and keeping economic links open between the two countries, particularly as the threat of additional sanctions rise. Iranian government officials reportedly pay regular visits to Dubai, although it is difficult to ascertain if the pace has picked up in recent years.  The headliner was, of course, President Ahmadi-Nejad's May 13, 2007 visit to Dubai, which was the first visit by an Iranian head of government since UAE unification.  While his private meeting with business people was reportedly attended by prominent names, a source claimed he said little of substance.  We also heard that few from the established Iranian community in Dubai attended his large rally at the Iranian Club's soccer stadium (ref B).  7.(S//NF) In addition to the president, the Iranian Minister of Commerce and the head of the Central Bank have reportedly visited Dubai recently.  According to press reports, the Minister of Commerce attended a recent IBC meeting and promised to take steps to ease UAE-Iran trade in response to member requests.  Contacts have indicated to IRPoffs that the Iranian government is attempting to exercise greater influence over the IBC.  8.(C//NF) As a sign of the importance both countries ascribe to their relationship, Iran recently appointed one of its highest profile diplomats, former Foreign Ministry spokesman and Deputy Foreign Minister, Hamid Reza Asefi, as its Ambassador to the UAE.  9.(C//NF) The Iranian Consul General to Dubai reportedly holds regular meetings with the sheikhs of Dubai on trade relations. At a recent "VIP Day" to promote the Ras al Khaimah Free Trade Zone (RAKFTZ) to the consulate and corporate communities, Poleconoff observed the Iranian Consul General being personally shepherded from site to site by RAKFTZ chairman Sheikh Faisal and RAKFTZ CEO Oussama el Omari and being seated to the sheikh's immediate right.  10.(S//NF) Comment:  Dubai's relatively free business environment and less restrictive social atmosphere continues to attract Iranians, who already make up roughly 10% of the UAE population.  Also, the ease of transporting goods to Iran from Dubai provides a critical supply line for Iranian imports of goods and services, including those - Iranian and other - who wish to skirt US sanctions and UN resolutions.  The image of Ahmadi-Nejad landing in the UAE in May as Vice President Cheney departed exemplifies the difficulty the UAE faces in managing its relationships with those two countries, both impossible to ignore.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  In a surprise move, the oil ministry announced the evening of June 26 that gasoline rationing would begin in Iran at midnight, with a limit for private citizens of 100 liters of gasoline per month.  According to reports by AFP and BBC, the announcement sparked protests, particularly by angry youths, and resulted in long lines at gas tanks, as well as fires at two gas stations in Tehran.  Deputy Majles speaker Bahonar said on Iranian TV that the reason that rationing was implemented without warning was for safety concerns; hoarding gasoline would be a potential fire risk.  Iranian analysts agreed the Iranian government had "no choice but to" implement rationing for economic and security reasons, given the huge sums Iran was spending on gasoline subsidies and Iran's vulnerability to a gasoline embargo, but predicted corruption would result. Last month, the government raised gasoline prices by 25% in an attempt to reduce consumption.  It will be telling how the government reacts to these protests over rationing, how long the protests last, and how rationing will impact public opinion towards the government.  End Summary  2.(C) In a move that surprised the Iranian population and Iran analysts, the oil ministry announced with only a few hours notice on June 26 that gasoline rationing would begin at midnight.  While the government had been making noises about implementing rationing, the start date has been delayed several times, and it was not clear whether the government would implement it all, given public resistance.  Risky political decision ------------------------  3.(C) In response to the announcement of rationing, angry Iranian "youths" reportedly attacked a petrol station in the Pounak area of northwest Tehran, burning a car and pumps, witnesses said.  The same youths threw stones and shouted slogans denouncing President Ahmadi-Nejad.  An Iranian journalist told AFP that another gas station in the south of Tehran was attacked in the Azadi area.  Anti-riot police were called in to disperse the demonstrators, according to AFP.  BBC reported that violence broke out in nine separate areas of Tehran, it is assumed that the petrol station fires are included in the alleged "areas" of violence.  One Iranian professor told IRPoffs recently that a primary motivation for the rounding up of "thugs" over the past few months was in preparation for the implementation of rationing.  These "thugs" are reportedly those people suspected by police of being likely to lead street rioting.  4.(C) While foreign press has reported on the alleged fires and protests by Iranian youth in reaction to the rationing, Iranian news agencies have mainly focused on the details of the announcement itself.  The sole exception seen so far is Iranian state radio which noted long lines of cars waiting to fuel-up prior to the midnight deadline.  Its account de-emphasized any violence and said car owners were filling up their tanks, emptying them into portable containers, and getting back in line.  The report also complained of incessant honking of car horns.  Other Iranian news reports mention long lines at fuel pumps in Tehran and elsewhere, but little else regarding public reaction.  First price hike; now rationing -------------------------------  5.(U) On May 22, the government raised the price of gasoline by 25% -- although gasoline is still cheaper than water in Iran -- to try to stem high levels of consumption.  It also implemented use of smartcards required for purchasing gasoline (reftels). The government initiated limited rationing June 14, limiting government vehicles to 10 liters of gasoline a day.  Full rationing was supposed to be implemented at the same time in May but was delayed several times.  The last official statement indicated late July, preempted by the June 26 surprise announcement.  6.(U) Iranian state television announced that the following quotas would be in place:  -- Personal vehicles:  100 liters of gasoline per month -- Government vehicles:  300 liters per month. -- Taxis:  800 liters per month.  RPO DUBAI 00000043  002.2 OF 003   -- Personal people carriers:  600 liters per month. -- Agency petrol vehicles:  450 liters a month. -- Driving school vehicles:  450 liters a month. -- Ambulances:  450 liters a month. -- Peykan [Old Hillman cars assembled in Iran] minivans and "Mazda":  1,000 liters a month. -- Toyota 1600 and Mazda 2000:  450 liters a month. -- Nissan and Zamyad and tractors of Saypa variety, trucks, minivans, buses, minibuses, trailers and auto-camping vehicles: 600 liters a month. -- Diplomatic vehicles:  600 liters a month.  7.(U) The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hameneh was summoned to the Majles to answer questions on the rationing.  Quoting Vaziri-Hameneh, IRNA explained that the system would initially be in place for three months, after which time the government would evaluate rationing.  Deputy Majles speaker Mohammed Reza Bahonar said on Iranian TV that more lead-time was not given as there were fears that people might stockpile petrol and cause safety concerns. Rooz Online reported a week earlier that over 200 fires had broken out in Tehran over the last week alone allegedly caused by people  hoarding gasoline in their homes in anticipation of rationing.  Wise economic decision ----------------------  8.(S) In the run-up to the rationing, IRPoffs discussed the petrol rationing system, in separate meetings, with an Iranian economist, a consultant who worked on the smartcard system for gasoline rationing, and a Tehran-based political analyst.  All agreed that maintaining current levels of gasoline subsidies was not viable, costing the government approximately $30 billion, reportedly almost half of its overall expenditures for subsidies.  Iran reportedly spends $70 billion annually on subsidies, or a third of its GNP.  While Iran is the fourth largest oil exporter, it is the second largest gasoline importer, on a net volume basis.  9.(S) An Iranian economist said he is generally opposed to rationing because it often leads to corruption and smuggling, but he admitted that "something must be done" to curb Iranian government spending on gasoline subsidies.  Prior to the June 26 announcement, the economist claimed Ahmadi-Nejad did not "have the stomach" to implement a rationing system.  "If he did," continued the economist, "it would outweigh all the damage he's done to the economy over the last two years."  Unfortunately, he said, rationing would likely place a much higher burden on law-abiding citizens, but only be a nuisance for others.  He claimed that 70,000 people have already been identified in Tehran as needing "extra" gasoline as they are involved in the public transportation sector, i.e. taxis, buses, etc.  He clearly believed that a large portion of the individuals should not qualify for such a program.  (Note: many Iranians use their cars as unofficial taxis as a second job to make ends meet. Endnote)  The economist added that despite the fact that smartcard usage was "enforced" as of May 22 (reftels), there are still pumps that do not enforce the card rule, and it is easy to use someone else's card.  10.(S) A Tehran-based political analyst claimed that Ahmadi-Nejad had no choice but to implement a rationing system. The analyst said that for both economic and security reasons, a rationing system must be enforced.  He claimed that the amount of money that the government spends annually on gasoline subsidies equals or exceeds the budget of the Ministry of Education and could easily pay the salary increases that Iranian teachers' associations demanded during strikes this year. Iran's representative to OPEC Hossein Kasempour Ardebili publicly laid out Iran's security issues regarding gasoline, saying June 19 that Iran is concerned about its vulnerability to potential US action to cut off its gasoline supplies.  Ardebili told Sharq newspaper that Iran needs to adopt appropriate measures to address this concern, saying "the domestic consumption, for example, must be lowered as much as possible."  11.(U) Implementing a rationing system without a scheme in place to meet excess demand would cause a black market to spring up overnight, claimed journalist Hamed Qoddusi in a June 14 Sharq article.  Qoddusi advocated private-sector control of a secondary-market that would meet gasoline needs - at a market determined price - should individuals require additional gasoline above and beyond the rationed allotments.  Technology behind rationing  RPO DUBAI 00000043  003.2 OF 003   ----------------------------  12.(S) Two years and $80 million dollars later, Iran has a system in place to facilitate the rationing of gasoline, said an Iranian economist.  The technology used to set up the system, however, is fairly outdated, alleged a consultant who claimed to have worked on the project.  He was doubtful the smartcard could be used for complex pricing schemes.  The consultant said that the "data dumps" from the separate pump stations to the main database are not on-line, but only done via satellite up-link periodically.  However, the consultant claimed that the Iranian government deserves some credit for installing the technology throughout the entire country, even in the most rural of areas. Furthermore, consumers will be able to set up debit accounts linked to their smartcards to pay for gasoline purchases. He also noted that there exists the potential that intelligence services will now be able to track people's movements by tracking use of their smartcards (Note: Iran does not currently have credit cards.  Endnote).  13.(C) Comment.  Iranians in Dubai have heard that "the capital city is shut down today," July 27, because of the reaction to rationing, but we do not know yet whether this is an exaggeration.  Negative public reaction to rationing, particularly as other economic indicators worsen, was to be expected, and is probably the main reason the government has put off this decision for years.  It is likely that the threat of a foreign embargo on gasoline imports is the primary motivator for swallowing the poison now, particularly for a president who promised to economic justice.  The immediate issue to follow is how efficiently the government puts down protests, and by what means, as well as whether the themes of any further protests are generically anti-rationing or become more focused on the president.  At a recent university protest against Ahmadi-Nejad, the government took no action initially but arrested the offenders several months later.  14.(C) Comment continued:  In any case, gasoline rationing is a healthy and overdue step for Iran's economy, whatever the motivation.  It will not come without a cost, however.  A gasoline ration brought about by the Iranian government as opposed to by the international community will likely increase the government's unpopularity; a rise in gasoline prices triggered by a foreign-imposed boycott could, conversely, boost solidarity with the government.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary: A political science professor from Tehran who met with IRPOffs June 21 predicted that detained Iranian-American scholar Haleh Esfandiari would be released within a week or two, with bail.  The professor did not speak on any authority but made the prediction based on how past cases were handled.  The contact also predicted that the Iranian government would concede and accept suspension of enrichment - which they would see as surrender - by January or February 2008, and that by then the incentives package offered by the P5+1 would be off the table and Iran would get nothing in return.  He claimed that Deputy National Security Council Secretary Vaidi had told him, when he shared this prediction with him, not to put money onit.  The professor also confirmed that the government crackdown on academia and civil society is having a marked chilling effect on the intellectual sector of society, and that fewer people are willing to risk attending conferences in foreign countries.  The contact also said that Voice of America television is widely viewed in Iran and he regards it as credible and balanced, although Iranians assume that any program guests have the backing of the US government.  End Summary.  Detained Americans -------------------  2.(S) A political science professor who knows detained Iranian-American scholar Haleh Esfandiari predicted that she and the other detained Iranian-Americans would be released within a week or two, with bail.  He made clear he did not speak on any authority but made the prediction based on how past cases were handled, including Iranian-Canadian academic Ramin Jahanbegloo. The contact saw as a good sign the recent statement by an Iranian official that while the detainees had admitted to wrongdoing, they were working for good.  This, the professor said, could serve as a justification the government could give for their release.  He expressed disappointment that there was no avenue for him and others to lobby for their release.  All of the scholars who spoke at the Woodrow Wilson Center are nervous now, the contact said, adding that one of them he knew had been interrogated recently.  The professor said he himself was questioned in 2005 after going to a Track II conference in Athens and that many of the questions were about Haleh Esfandiari.  Based on this, he said, he had warned Esfandiari not to go to Iran.  (Note: A former deputy minister under President Khatami also predicted these detainees would be released soon, saying Iran realizes it is not getting anything for their detention and that Esfandiari's published works makes clear her neutral stance on US-Iran issues.  End note.)  Nuclear discussions and sanctions ---------------------------------  3.(S)  The professor also discussed the nuclear negotiations, predicting that the government would concede and accept suspension of enrichment - which they would see as surrender - by January or February 2008, and that by then the incentives package offered by the P5+1 would be off the table, and Iran would get nothing in return.  The contact claimed, however, to have shared his prediction  with Deputy National Security Council Secretary Vaidi who told him not to put money on it.  He said Vaidi told him - without explaining - that there was more to the issue than the nuclear issue.  The professor also repeated an Iranian government claim that even temporarily stopping the centrifuges from spinning would damage them.  4.(S)  According to the professor, former nuclear negotiator Hossein Mousavian was released due to the intervention of Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani.  The contact, who claimed to know Mousavian from his association with the Expediency Council's Center for Strategic Research where Mousavian is the deputy, opined that the arrest was a warning to Mousavian to stop criticizing the president's administration in public.  He said Mousavian thought Iran should have accepted the P5+1 incentives package, and along with some others on the left, supports suspension.  (Note: other contacts have also said there is a faction in Iranian circles, including Rafsanjani, that support suspension.  End note.)  5.(C)  The contact opined that sanctions are hurting the economy, citing rumors that Iran has lost $200 billion in  RPO DUBAI 00000045  002.2 OF 003   foreign investment to Dubai.  (Note: The contact recounted a popular joke about rationing: A man asked a Nigerian, "What is your opinion about the rationing of chicken?" The Nigerian replies, "What is a chicken?"  He asks a Swiss man the same question.  The Swiss man replies, "What is rationing?"  He asks an Iranian the same question, and the Iranian replies, "What is an opinion?"  End note.)  Important regime figures, corruption ------------------------------------  6.(C) Asked about where President Ahmadi-Nejad ranks on the list of most important people in the Iranian government, the contact placed him in the top five.  The most important person is Supreme Leader Khamenei, he said; then Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani, Guardian Council chair Jannati, Assembly of Experts chair Meshkini, President Ahmadi-Nejad, IRGC commander Safavi, Judiciary chief Shahrudi, and Islamic Coalition Party head Asgaroladi.  7.(S)  On the topic of corruption, the contact said that though Iranians view Rafsanjani and his family as corrupt because they use connections and access to amass personal wealth, President Ahmadi-Nejad reportedly taking 350 million tomans (approx. USD 337,000) from the Tehran municipality for his presidential campaign is not seen as corruption because it was not for personal use.  In contrast to Rafsanjani's sons, the Supreme Leader's sons stay out of business and therefore are not regarded as corrupt.  Asked about the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba, the contact said he has some behind-the-scenes power and is said to be link to the paramilitary group Ansar-e Hizballah.  The contact also said that the Supreme Leader's office has 2-3 billion dollars per year to dispense, including to other countries. Asked about Iranian public opinion of its government's actions in Iraq, the contact said that people resent the fact that Iran sends money to Iraq and to Palestinian groups that is needed at home.  Civil society and polling -------------------------  8.(C)  The professor said that the crackdown on civil society and the arrests of Iranian-American scholars have had a chilling effect on the academic and NGO community in Iran.  Scholars who attend conferences in foreign countries are regularly interrogated or even arrested upon their return, he said. (Note:  While the professor acknowledged that government intimidation of civil society has been quite effective, he still plans to travel to the US for a conference in July.  End note.)  9.(C)  In the case of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, the dissident cleric who was arrested in 2006 along with several of his followers, the contact said he has seen rumors in the press that Boroujerdi had received the death penalty by the religious court, but he said it would be very unusual for the government to carry out such a sentence against a cleric.  He said that even in cases of non-clerics accused of apostasy, such as scholar Hashem Aghajari, the death sentence was overturned and he was released.  10.(S) The contact claimed that several NGOs are actually run by the Intelligence Ministry (MOIS).  For example, he said it was widely known in the academic and NGO community that the Research Institute for Strategic Studies is affiliated with MOIS, even though it claims to be affiliated with the Education Ministry. The contact said that MOIS conducts public opinion polls through NGO cut-outs.  According to him, the most reliable polls are conducted by MOIS, but the results are never released to the public.  In general, he said, polling in Iran is unreliable. Iranians tend to be wary of pollsters because they are never sure to whom they are speaking.   Elections and voting, Voice of America --------------------------------------  11.(S)  Asked his opinion about prospects for the 2008 Majles elections, the professor said he does not expect much change. He predicted that the Guardian Council will again disqualify many reformist candidates.  The professor allowed, however that more centrist-rightists could predominate in next elections. The contact criticized voting procedures in Iran as ripe for abuse, saying there are no voting districts or voter's registration.  Iranians simply present their identity card at  RPO DUBAI 00000045  003.2 OF 003   any polling station anywhere in the country in order to vote. Iranians can even vote for Majles representatives in districts where they do not reside.  (Note: another contact who reportedly worked in the past on the staff of the Guardian Council claimed that there are 90 million national identity cards in a country with a population of 70 million, inferring the potential for massive fraud.  End note.)  12.(C)  The professor added that voting for the five designated religious minority Majles representatives is nominally limited to members of the respective religious minorities, but since religion is not indicated on the national identity card, it can be difficult to enforce.  The polling stations for those five elections are generally centers of worship, or community centers belonging to the designated religious minorities.  The contact added that during the Khatami presidency, religious minorities petitioned to be issued separate identity cards that indicated religion.  This was reportedly in order to protect them being punished for violating restrictions placed on Muslims, but not non-Muslims; for example, possession of alcohol.  13.(C)  Regarding Voice of America broadcasts, the professor claimed that VOA programs are widely viewed and that he hears all different kinds of people taking about them.  The professor regards VOA programming as generally credible and balanced, although he conceded that Iranians tend to believe that whoever is a guest on VOA programs is supported by the US government. For example, he said, when Reza Pahlavi was on VOA and was referred to as the "prince," Iranians assumed that the USG supports the monarchist cause; then, when a nationalist is featured on the program, people assume the USG supports Iranian nationalists.  14.(S)  Comment:  We would assess this political science professor, known for several years, as a generally reliable contact, although his direct contact with influential actors in Iran is unknown.  In addition to his academic work, he is involved in civil society, particularly on women's issues.  He is not a general advocate of US-Iran engagement, expressing fear in a previous meeting that if Iran reaches a nuclear deal with the US, the US would turn its back on human rights in Iran. IRPoffs assured him that even if the international community reaches an agreement with Iran on the nuclear issue, the US would maintain its emphasis on the rights of the Iranian people. BURNS 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000047  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  7/11/2017 TAGS: ECON, PGOV, KPLS, IR SUBJECT: RECENT PUBLIC OPINION POLL TRACKS WITH IRPO'S ANECDOTAL REPORTING  REF: RPO DUBAI 0045  RPO DUBAI 00000047  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary.  The results of the Terror Free Tomorrow June 2007 survey of 1000 Iranians overall tracks with what IRPO hears anecdotally from Iranians.  Both the survey and IRPO's findings indicate a large amount of support for Iran's nuclear energy program among Iranians, but mixed views regarding a nuclear weapon.  While support for the nuclear program runs deep in Iranian society, the people see Iran's economy as the top issue of concern.  The challenge there in is that while the Iranian government closely monitors public opinion, its policy making is not often responsive to public wishes.  End Summary.  2.(C) The telephonic survey has the advantage of a much more methodical assessment of views and much broader access to the Iranian population than IRPO has in Dubai.  The reliability of polling in Iran is questionable, however, given that Iranians tell us that the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) also does polling (and never publishes the results.  reftel).  If widely known, this would color how freely Iranians are likely to speak to an unknown pollster.  Furthermore, many Iranians are nervous that their email and telephone lines are monitored. There always seems to be a cultural tendency to tell people what they want to hear.  It's the economy, stupid -----------------------------  3.(C) A main finding of the study is that 29% of respondents view developing nuclear weapons as a very important priority for the Iranian government, while 88% of respondents considered improving the economy a very important priority.  At the same time, 52% favor the development of nuclear weapons and believe Iranians would live in a safer world if Iran had nuclear weapons.  Not an insignificant number - 31% - thought that if the government had nuclear weapons, Iranian people would live in a more dangerous world.  This generally tracks with what Iranian interlocutors tell us.  By far, the economy is their greatest concern, a sentiment then candidate Ahmadi-Nejad skillfully tapped into, after the previous government was criticized for prioritizing social reform over the economy.  We are not surprised by the fact that 92% ranked creation of new jobs and 90% curbing inflation as very important tasks for the government, particularly given that 64% of respondents said they did not work.  4.(C) It was noteworthy that the percentage who said Ahmadi-Nejad has failed to keep his campaign promise to "put oil money on the table of the people themselves" was not higher than 56%.  Most Iranians we see in Dubai have only criticism for the president, but again we are unlikely to meet those people getting direct handouts on the president's provincial tours.  It would indicate that Ahmadi-Nejad's popularity may not be as low as it appears from the outside, but that many are still withholding judgment on his economic program.  This might explain the fact that less than half the respondents (42%) said they thought the Iranian economy was headed in the wrong direction, and barely more than half (52%) said the president's policies have not succeeded in reducing unemployment and inflation.  It seemed surprising that only 31.4% said their own economic situation was worse than when Ahmadi-Nejad took office in August 2005.  Nonetheless, only 18% of Iranians said the overall economic situation was excellent or good, despite the fact that reportedly journalists in Iran have been discouraged from writing negative stories about Iran's economy.   It is also important to note that some have benefited from rising property prices or from government largess.  5.(C) On the other hand, it seems significant in a country riddled with corruption that a larger percent (36%) thought overall corruption had decreased since Ahmadi-Nejad came into office - promising to go after the "oil mafia" and others - than those who thought corruption had increased (28%).  Again, this sentiment is contrary to several IRPO Dubai interlocutors who believe that those charged with cleaning up the smuggling are the real smugglers themselves.  Mixed views on nuclear issues -------------------------------------  6.(C) Numerous Iranians have told us they hope Iran develops a nuclear weapon, but it is clear most would like their government  RPO DUBAI 00000047  002.2 OF 003   to prioritize improving the economy.  The reasons why those Iranians support acquisition of a nuclear weapon seem to focus on security and national pride.  Post-Iran-Iraq war trauma seems to infuse Iranian society, and Iranians seem to fear that one day in the future they could again be the victim of an aerial attack or invasion - either by the US, Israel, or a future aggressive neighbor.  While a few Iranians tell us they are hoping for a US attack to overthrow their government, most say Iranians do not want any more violent upheaval.  Some Iranians also cite national pride as a reason why they want a nuclear weapon, usually indicating that if Pakistan has a bomb, so should they.  They feel that Iran will be taken more seriously if armed with a weapon.  Even some Iranians who are extremely critical of their government still support acquiring a nuclear weapon.  They do not view this as entrenching the current government in power but as protecting the Iranian nation.  A few Iranians, however, tell us they do not believe their government is seeking a nuclear weapon.  7.(C) The high numbers (79-80%) who responded they would favor Iran providing full inspections and a guarantee not to develop or possess nuclear weapons in exchange for various incentives is noteworthy, particularly as few Iranians we meet seem to know much about the contents of the P5+1 package on the table.  These results would suggest that they would support the package if information with more specifics could reach them.  It further reinforces the notion that the economy is much more important - at least to the Iranian people - than a nuclear program.  The finding that support for nuclear weapons drops to below 17% if Iran were to receive outside assistance in return for full inspections and a guarantee not to have nuclear weapons likely means that the respondents assumed such an agreement would improve the economy and at the same time, reduce the likelihood of military confrontation in the future.  8.(C) It is not surprising that 78% of Iranians favor the development of nuclear energy, given all the government's rhetoric equating nuclear energy with progress and international stature.  Also, at the time the poll was taken, the price of gasoline had just been increased 25% and rationing was being discussed.  In addition, Iranians have long suffered from electrical outages and high levels of pollution in large cities.  This statistic tracks with what we hear from Iranians.  US rapprochement -----------------------  9.(C) The figure of 68% of Iranians strongly or somewhat favoring normal relations and trade with US tracks with Iranian pollster Abbas Abdi's infamous 2003 survey that landed him in prison.  It seems low compared to what we hear (mostly from Iranians in Dubai for US visas, which tends to color what they say to us).  However, we are cognizant of the fact that we meet few Iranians from the estimated 10-20% of society who are considered hard-core supporters of the Islamic Republic.  10.(C) While it was not surprising that the European Union and specifically France rated higher than the US for desired trade relations, given their longstanding presence in Iran, we were surprised China and Russia outranked the US (64% strongly favored normal trade relations with China and 48% with Russia, versus 33% with the US).  Iranian markets are reportedly flooded with cheap Chinese goods.  While many say they would prefer higher quality US goods, perhaps many realize they would not be able to afford them even if they were available.  Although they may be perceived as reliable trade partners, as far as political partners, most Iranians tell us that the Chinese and the Russians cannot be trusted.  On the other hand, we were not surprised by the low rating the UK received (39%), given the widespread conspiracy theories we hear about continuing British "dominance" over Iran and "alliance with the mullahs."  Attitudes toward government -----------------------------------  11.(C) It is remarkable that 61% of respondents said over the phone that they strongly oppose (53%) or somewhat oppose (8%) "a political system where the 'Supreme Leader' rules according to religious principles and cannot be chosen or replaced by a direct vote of the people."  In the corollary question, 72% strongly supported and 7% somewhat supported a political system where the 'Supreme Leader,' along with all leaders, can be chosen and replaced by a free and direct vote of the people. This would indicate a high degree of disagreement with the concept of velayet-e faqih in Iran and a high desire for greater  RPO DUBAI 00000047  003.2 OF 003   democracy, which tracks with what Iranians tell us.  Because the wording of the question contain too many variables (existence of a 'Supreme Leader,' government based on religious principles, and issue of direct vote), however, it does not reliably measure level of overall approval of the existing government.  The very low degree of support (10%) for a return of a monarchial system tracks with what IRPO hears, although a number of people maintain that Iran "needs" an authoritarian leader.  Financial assistance to terrorist groups --------------------------------------------- -  12.(C) The wording of several other questions - at least as translated into English on the organization's website terrorfreetomorrow.org - were also open to several interpretations.  The findings noted almost two-thirds of Iranians support "financial assistance" to groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hizballah, and Iraqi Shia militias (notably a slighter larger "strong support" rating for Sunni Palestinian groups than Lebanese Shia Hizballah or Iraqi Shia militia groups).  This seems to contradict with what we largely hear - resentment that funds badly needed at home are shipped off to Arabs.  However, the question did not specify funds for humanitarian versus military support.  Groups like Hamas and Hizballah are widely recognized to be involved with many humanitarian projects, such as hospitals.  There is pervasive sympathy in Iran for Palestinian and Iraqi suffering, as well as fear that a normalized Iraq would once again turn against Iran. We also note that few Iranians with whom we talk seem to know anything about Iranian military assistance to Iraqi Shia groups.  Dividing the question would have given a more useful response. It is noteworthy in any case that support for this assistance is ranked lower than seeking trade and political relations with the West, even at the cost of recognition of Israel (55%).  Again, the economy is the Iranian people's primary immediate concern, with security likely a close second.  Ranking priorities ----------------------  13.(C) Another set of questions could be read in two different ways, at least in the English translation:  "I am going to read you a list of possible long-term goals for the government of Iran.  Please tell me whether you think these goals are very important, somewhat important, somewhat unimportant, or not at all important for the government of Iran."  The respondents could have understood the question to ask if I think that the government should prioritize this or how I judge the government to be actually prioritizing this.  In any case, again, the economy by far got the highest rating of importance. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary.  Populist President Ahmadi-Nejad is being forced to announce some very unpopular decisions - under the direction of the Supreme Leader - due to the enormous pressure the Iranian government is under to "fix" the economy.  While public attention was still focused on gasoline rationing (reftel), government officials quietly announced an increase in the costs of electricity, gas, and water; and eliminated cement subsidies.  Anecdotally, IRPoff was told by a single-source that cost controls in the dairy sector would soon be lifted as well.  Most likely the government realized it needs to make the very unpopular decision of removing some subsidies - in the face of severe domestic criticism and a future third UN resolution - and is doing so as far ahead of the upcoming Majles election as possible.  It is particularly noteworthy, that the removal of subsidies (as well as other measures like promotion of privatization) - across several sectors - is a departure from nearly three decades of Iranian public-sector driven economic policy.  Such a market-oriented change in economic policy is an important - and long overdue - structural reform.  It is in-line with the current 5-year economic development plan and follows the advice of international and domestic economists. Ahmadi-Nejad may be taking these politically risky economic measures to bolster Iran's economy in the face of current or anticipated international economic pressure.  End summary.  It is that bad ---------------  2.(C) According to multiple sources, the amount of criticism leveled against the Iranian government's economic performance is at an unprecedented level relative to recent years.  Leaders are under enormous pressure to "fix" the economy, report contacts. Radio Free Europe reported that 50 Iranian economists met President Ahmadi-Nejad July 13 to personally express their dissatisfaction with his economic decisions, saying that his policies "lack any basis in science."  Despite best efforts, the government's economic policies continue to backfire and cause discord.  In just one anecdotal story of many, IRPoff was told that several private banks are under threat of bankruptcy after the recent government decree lowering interest rates - a decision for which Ahmadi-Nejad was severely criticized in the press.  According to one Iranian economist, the decision has caused a run on all banks.  People - not knowing what else to do - are putting their money in the real estate market - causing prices to jump yet again.  The housing market in Tehran has gone up by 70% this past year alone, said an Iranian economic consultant.  3.(C) It appears the government is now realizing that it has to make structurally sound, yet domestically unpopular decisions in the face of a possible tightening of sanctions and the expected third UN resolution.  The government is most likely trying to push these changes through all at once and as far ahead of the upcoming Majles elections as possible.  The changes also track with Iran's 5-year economic development plan, which policymakers must pay some nominal deference to, even if it is often ignored.  Most noteworthy is that the decision to remove subsidies tracks with the advice of international and domestic analysts and is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic.  Recent unpopular decisions --------------------------------  4.(C) After several earlier postponements, the IRIG announced on midnight June 26, that gasoline would be rationed as of June 27 (reftel).  While the public was still reeling from the ramifications of the announcement, the General Manager of National Gas of Iran Seyyed Reza Kasa'izadeh announced July 4 that rates for electricity, gas and water would increase by 15% "next week."  Referring to gasoline rationing at the inauguration ceremony for Shahid Reyis Ali Delvari Dam in Bushehr Province, Ahmadi-Nejad said July 5, "this type of conservation could also be applied to electricity consumption." Mehr news agency reported July 7 that the cement subsidy was being eliminated.  IRPoff was told July 1 by an Iranian consultant that dairy farmers were finally given the green light to raise prices after several smaller farms went bankrupt earlier this year - allegedly the government has been artificially holding prices steady.  The consultant claimed that prices of butter, milk, cheese, etc are about to increase 20-25%.  (Note:  Contacts have recently alleged that there is a  RPO DUBAI 00000048  002.2 OF 002   butter shortage in general - which is why import tax on butter was just pushed down to 0%.  Endnote)  5.(C) Comment.  The fact that the government - under the direction of the Supreme Leader - appears to be acting on the recommendations of sound economic doctrine and advice from its own economists to remove some subsidies would seem to indicate that the government is at its reckoning point in terms of its domestic economic policy.  It is coming to the realization that it can no longer continue its reckless economic policies - even with high oil prices.  Instead, Iran may well be seeking to bolster its heretofore fragile economy through long overdue structural policy adjustments such as diversification, privatization, lifting of subsidies, etc., in an effort to withstand building international pressures.  This policy change may augur needed adjustments to planned UN or international community economic sanctions approaches. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S)  Summary: Three Iranians who claim to be well-connected - a former IRGC official, a former Guardian Council staff member, and a leading businessman - gave contrasting views of the behind-the-scenes power structure of the Iranian regime. According to the former IRGC official, the bazaaris (traditional merchant class) run the country, having bought off the ruling clergy.  The former Guardian Council staff member claimed that the clerical elite in Qom make ultimate decisions on all major policies, because Supreme Leader Khamenei does not have sufficient religious credentials to make those decisions.  The businessman claimed that a group of 500 "fascist neocons" headed by 10-12 influential men run the country.  All three sources claimed the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba is an avenue to reach the Supreme Leader, although the IRGC official said Mojtaba is used by others and is not influential in his own right.  There have long been competing theories among Iran scholars and analysts about who actually wields authority in Iran.  Even these purported regime insiders differ on where ultimate authority resides, lending credence to the view that no one power center predominates.  End Summary.  Bazaaris are in charge, says former IRGC official --------------------------------------------- -------------- -------------------  2.(S) Three Iranians who claim to be well-connected recently offered IRPO contrasting assessments of the behind-the-scenes structure of power and influence in the Iranian regime.  A former IRGC official maintained that the bazaaris, the well-established and traditionally influential merchant class, essentially run the country.  He claimed that they have placed "their people" in government offices and that they have bought off the ruling clergy.  The former IRGC official noted that bazaaris have long collected alms on behalf of the clerics.  He added that since the Islamic revolution, the bazaaris have been permitted to invest alms on behalf of the clerics, who would, theoretically, redistribute the profits to the poor.  The contact claimed that much of this money is invested or held in Dubai.  3.(S)  The former IRGC official described the bazaaris as different from the rest of the private sector, saying that the bazaaris are generally a well-established and well-organized group of mostly traders that are present in every major city. He said that banks will not loan money to ordinary people without a bribe, but that bazaaris will get bank loans and then re-loan the money.  The contact claimed that bazaaris, IRGC and other groups offer loans at very high interest rates (60% or more), notwithstanding the Islamic prohibition on usury.  Asked why the bazaaris would not force the privatization of the oil industry in order to gain control of it, he said that they are traders not producers, and that they make money selling equipment to the government.  The bazaaris will resist change unless it benefits them economically, but are adept at deriving business advantage from changes in Iranian domestic and foreign policy.  For example, asked how President Ahmadi-Nejad's anti-Israel and Holocaust rhetoric serves bazaari interests, the contact said that it increased their trade with Arab businessmen, with whom Ahmadi-Nejad is popular.  4.(S) The former IRGC official claimed that the Supreme Leader's son, Mojtaba, is well-placed but is not powerful himself.  The contact alleged that Basij commander Hejazi and other members of the Supreme Leader's office use Mojtaba as an avenue to influence his father.  The former IRGC official claimed that the Supreme Leader discourages his sons from entering business or politics.  Former GC staff member says clerics in Qom and their hardline supporters run the country --------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------------------------  5.(S)  A former staff member on the Guardian Council where he was an aide to Presidential Office spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham, maintained that Supreme Leader Khamenei does not have sufficient religious credentials to make authoritative decisions and that he relies on the senior clerics at the seminaries in Qom to bolster and sometimes make major policy decisions.  The  RPO DUBAI 00000049  002.2 OF 003   contact said that the religious community is divided between supporters of Grand Ayatollah Montazeri - a noted critic of the regime and the concept of absolute rule by the jurisprudent (velayat-e-faqhi) - and the more hard-line pro-government clerics associated with the Qom Theological Lecturer's Association (QTLA).  He said that these hard-line clerics have influential advisers, some of whom are bazaaris.  8.(S) The former Guardian Council staff member said that Habibollah Asgaroladi, the head of the Islamic Coalition Party, is an influential figure, and also listed some key members of the QTLA.  These include: Guardian Council head Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati; Ayatollah Momammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi; Ayatollah Hossein Rasti Kashani; Ayatollah Mohammad Emani-Kashani; Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi; Grand Ayatollah Lotfallah Safi Golpayegani; Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi; Tehran Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ahmad Khatami; Ayatollah Seyyed Hasan Taheri Khorram-Abadi; Ghazi Khorram-Abadi; Hojatoleslam Husseini-Bushehri; Ayatollah Reza Ostadi; Majid Momen; Ayatollah Gholamreza Rezvani; FNU Ghadari; Ayatollah Jafar Sobhani; Ayatollah Abbas Vaez Tabasi; Ayatollah Mohyeddin Haeri Shirazi; Ayatollah Ali Meshkini; Grand Ayatollah Nouri-Hamedani (who was accused of being in charge of the "chain killings" of prominent Iranian reform activists during the Khatami period).  9.(S) The contact said the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba plays a role, but does not have an independent power base.  According to the contact, the ruling clerics operate on the basis of self-preservation and personal interests instead of national interests.  10.(S)  Speaking about the nuclear issue, the former Guardian Council staff member said he believes Iran wants to develop a nuclear bomb for deterrent purposes, but that no one would be foolish enough to use it.  He said he believes that developing a nuclear weapon and maintaining the status quo in Iraq are two of the ruling elite's top goals.  The contact maintained that the "semi-government," such as Rafsanjani and Khatami, support suspension, but the senior clerics in Qom oppose it, and the latter's views are Iran's declared positions.  Regarding future elections, he said that in a country of 70 million people, there are 90 million identity cards (which is the only documentation required for voting).  If the QLTA and their hardline supporters decide to manipulate the next election, he said, Ahmadi-Nejad could be returned for a second term as president.  Khamenei relies on group of 500 "neocons" says businessman --------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------------------------  11. (S) The third contact is a leading businessman whose company is among the top three soap and detergent companies in Iran.  He claimed that a group of 500 "fascist neocons" led by 10-12 men actually run the country.  He described the group of 500 as the people that the ruling clerics have always relied upon to "carry out their dirty work," and said that they report to a group of 10-12 men, specifically naming IRGC commander Rahim Yahya Safavi, Deputy IRGC commander Mohammad Baqr-Zolqadr, Basij commander Mohammad Hejazi, and Keyhan editor Hossein Shariatmadari.  These men report to the Supreme Leader through his son, Mojtaba, the businessman claimed.  The contact recounted that the 1999 student protests worried Khamenei, because taken to its logical conclusion, the student movement advocated an Iran without a Supreme Leader.  After 1999, Khamenei relied more on conservative factions to suppress popular uprisings, alleged the businessman.  12.(S)  Regarding the 2005 presidential election, the businessman claimed that the group of 500 were under the impression that they would be voting - and encouraging others to vote for - Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, but that they were instructed at the last minute to vote for Ahmadi-Nejad.  13.(S) Comment:  While IRPO cannot independently assess the validity of these contacts' claims, we have heard each of these general theories about the power structure before from other Iranian contacts.  All appear to agree that Supreme Leader Khamenei does not exercise absolute authority.  It is noteworthy that each of the three separate contacts described the Supreme Leader's son, Mojtaba, as an avenue to reach Khamenei.  It is IRPO's analysis that the bazaaris and the clerical elite both exert a strong influence on policy.  The Supreme Leader meanwhile maintains an array of tools to balance the needs of  RPO DUBAI 00000049  003.2 OF 003   these and other constituencies and his priorities for the regime.  What is clear is that the key levers of power are exercised behind the scenes, through informal contact, and that even those who claim to be well-connected differ on where the power and influence in the regime truly lies.

REASON: 1.4 (d) 1.(S/NF) Summary:  Iran's judiciary put out a statement, as reported August 12, that it had completed its investigations into the case of two detained Iranian-Americans, Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh, without stating what would happen next.  Unconfirmed evidence suggests that Iran may feel it has accomplished much of what it wanted with their arrests and may be seeking to de-escalate the situation, including a report that Esfandiari's jailers were looking for a reason to release her. In this light, IRPO recommends low-key press guidance on this latest development that does not give the government any excuse not to release them.  This stance will need to be revisited once the judiciary announces the next step in their cases.  End summary  2.(U) Iran's judiciary put out a statement, as reported August 12, that it had completed its investigations into the case of two detained Iranian-Americans, Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh.  Esfandiari, a director at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, and Tajbaksh, a consultant with the Open Society Institute, have been detained since May on allegations that they were trying to spark a "soft" revolution in Iran.  According to the deputy prosecutor, the two detainees must complete a series of (undefined) written tasks before their fate is decided.  The prosecutor added that Iranian-American Ali Shakeri's case has no connection to the cases of Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh and gave no further information about his case.  He made no mention of Iranian-American journalist Parnaz Azima's case.  (Note: Shakeri is also imprisoned; Azima has not been detained but her passport was taken by the government.  Endnote)  Served their purpose? --------------------------  3.(C) While it is unclear whether the judiciary's statement means they will be released or be prosecuted for crimes against the state, there are several indications that Iran may be seeking to de-escalate this controversial issue that has brought (well-deserved) domestic and international criticism upon the government.  It is possible that Iran may feel it has already gained as much as it can from the arrests - by creating a chilling effect regarding contacts with the US with the airing of their "confessions" and showing that the US cannot protect anyone within the borders of Iran - while realizing that a trade for Iranians detained in Iraq is not likely.  While it is difficult to gauge the reaction in Iran to the "documentary" about Esfandiari, Tajbakhsh, and recently released academic Ramin Jahanbegloo, one Iranian told IRPoff that after the film, she had the impression that they had done "something" wrong.  4.(U) A July 21 editorial in Tehran Hezbollah, commenting on the televised "confessions," wrote, "These confessions proved that the hegemonic system's antagonism toward the Muslim world, and the Islamic Republic especially, has taken on a new form in the past decade, appearing as efforts to promote freedom, democracy and....This attractive appearance has unfortunately managed to deceive many academics and journalists at home.  In the most optimistic scenarios, they intended to serve the nation.  They were fooled by America's crocodile tears for this nation and unknowingly drawn into a soft subversion project.  In recent years, there have been many like Jahanbegloo and Tajbakhsh who have infiltrated Iran's academic and media centers, twisting the minds of students, journalists and researchers to serve the interests of the hegemonic system.  These confessions could serve as a warning to them and their audience to change their paths from pleasing the White House to serving the nation."  5.(S/NF) Despite the hyperbole, one former Iranian politician called televised "confessions" a useless tool in Iran.  In an email communication with IRPO Director, the reformer said politicians do not accept such media spectacles.  Reformist Iranian newspaper Hambastegi declared the era of televised confessions over.  It criticized the government for broadcasting statements of supposed opponents of the Islamic Republic who have not even been put on trial.  Looking to release Esfandiari? ------------------------------------  6.(S/NF) According to the politician -- considered a reliable source -- a recently released political prisoner who was reportedly held close to Esfandiari in Evin prison claimed to have heard the jailers were looking for a way to release Esfandiari.  That person indicated Esfandiari is not being treated badly, in relative terms, although it was noted that  RPO DUBAI 00000050  002.2 OF 002   there is no way that solitary confinement in Evin could be anything but bad.  No further arrests reported --------------------------------  7.(U) As reported July 25, Iranian Intelligence Minister Ejei said authorities had detained several people for having ties with two Iranian-Americans arrested in May, calling those detained "local agents" part of "network" used by Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh.  On July 31, the Iranian judiciary spokesman clarified Ejei's statements, saying no one has been arrested.  8.(S/NF) IRPO has been seeking out information about the situation of people we know to have had past ties to US think tanks, including Woodrow Wilson Center, and have not to date heard of any arrests directly linked to this investigation.  The government's overall clampdown on civil society continues unabated, however.  - One Iranian-American who says he was repeatedly interrogated over the past few months about his past affiliations with US think tanks and Esfandiari was never taken into custody and was recently allowed to leave the country.  He does not plan to return any time soon.  - One Iranian academic who had a fellowship at a Washington think tank in the past had his passport taken by the government when he returned to Iran this summer, but he indicates by email he is confident it will be returned soon.  He is trying to return to a fellowship at a US university.  - One Iranian analyst who gave several lectures at Woodrow Wilson Center has reportedly not been detained.  - Another Iranian who has lectured at Woodrow Wilson Center and who is currently in the US plans to return shortly to Iran.  9.(S/NF) Comment:  A number of Iranians have told IRPoffs that based on similar incidents in the past, they believe the four Iranian-Americans currently in prison or without their passports will soon be released.  We would note, however, that the current government seems less predictable than previous ones.  In the view of the former politician, if the US government engages Iran directly to try to get the Iranian-Americans  released, Iran will make demands such as an end to democracy funding or a swap with Iranian detainees in Iraq; conversely, if the US calls for their unconditional release, Iran is likely to hold them longer in prison.  The politician thought indirect channels such as the EU and the UN would likely be more effective.  10.(S) Comment Continued:  If it is true that the Iranian authorities are looking for a reason to release Esfandiari -- and hopefully, the others -- this recent announcement could be the first step.  Esfandiari's aired "confession," in particular, did not contain anything truly incriminating, although that would not stop the government from pursuing the case if it chose.  In any case, IRPO recommends that until Iran's next announcement on their case, USG public statements should be restrained in tone, saying simply that we hope this announcement indicates that these two, as well as Shakeri, will soon be released and that all, including Azima, be allowed to leave the country.  If Iran's next statement is that the detainees will be put on trial, we should then greatly increase the pressure. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)     1.(C) Summary:  NGOs in Iran remain under heavy pressure and scrutiny, a graduate student who is active with NGOs there told IRPO.  Many continue to operate, albeit more quietly.  One tool the government has used to intimidate NGOs is to keep them in uncertain legal status.  The student recounted her experiences with NGOs promoting women's rights, including being beaten by security forces at a women's rights rally.  Nonetheless, she was optimistic in the long-term for an improvement in women's rights in Iran and made clear that there are very courageous people in Iran working on this issue.  End summary.  2.(C)  A student involved in women's rights issues in Iran told IRPoffs that while the government has increased pressure on NGOs and activists in Iran, it has not succeeded in halting their activities.  The student, in Dubai to apply for a student visa for graduate studies in the US, said she has worked with the NGO of Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, although only at a low level.  She said she is also a member of the "Million Signatures" campaign for women's rights.  The goal of the "Million signatures" campaign (www.wechange.info) in Iran is two-fold:  - to educate Iranian women about their legal status under current Iranian law - to change laws regarded as discriminatory against women (Ref A).  3.(C) The student said the government is even opposed to their work trying to educate women about the rights they have under current laws.  She said that she and others who were gathering signatures have been harassed at times by government authorities.  During the March 8, 2007 women's rights rally in Tehran, she said her friend was arrested and imprisoned, and she herself was beaten by security forces so badly that she could not walk for two weeks.  (Note:  In early August, student activists Nasim Sarbandi and Fatemeh Dehdashti were each convicted to six months imprisonment and two year suspended sentences for collecting signatures at a Tehran metro station for the "Million Signatures" campaign.  Sarbandi told reformist news site "Rooz" that she and Dehdashti were convicted simply for collecting signatures, which the government views as publicity work against the Islamic Republic, or acting against national security.  End note.)  4.(C) The student said she also helped found four years ago a small NGO called Vistamehr Human Rights Organization (Anjoman-e Yari Resan-e Hoghooghe Bashar).  Officially they have about 30 members, she claimed, but only about half are active.  She indicated that the group's funding comes only from its members and a few donors, and they try not to have any contacts with the government.  She noted that they no longer update the NGO's website (www.vistamehr.com) because the organization has not been allowed to re-register and therefore is not licensed. (Note: In 2006, the government invalidated the registrations of all NGOs and required them to re-register for permission to operate.  The government has reportedly delayed or refused the re-registration applications of many NGOs.  Ref B. End note.)  5.(C) Nonetheless, the student said, the group continues its activities.   They organized a workshop for young girls on HIV and drugs and distributed informational pamphlets, despite the taboo surrounding the subjects of AIDS and sexual activity.  The group also holds weekly talks for young women to inform them of their rights and discuss women's issues, and regular lectures on various social and cultural issues.  In one, Italian Ambassador to Iran Roberto Toscano spoke on "Ethics and Humanity and its effect on political relations."  For security reasons, she added, access is by personal invitation only.  6.(C) Comment:  The interlocutor is an educated young Iranian woman who appeared to care deeply about the issue of women's rights in Iran. She did not seem overly worried about any personal negative consequences from her activities.  She was optimistic in the long-term for an improvement in women's rights in Iran and made clear that there are very courageous people in Iran working on this issue, despite the current crackdown on  RPO DUBAI 00000051  002.2 OF 002   NGOs by the government.  She is leaving the country for a graduate program in engineering in the US but claimed she would continue her work on this issue after returning to Iran.  We did not have the impression that it was the ongoing repression in Iran that was driving her desire to study abroad, rather the desire for a top-notch education. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S/NF)  Summary: The Iranian government has been exerting pressure on some participants in the International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP) for documentary filmmakers after their return to Iran.  One filmmaker who is a friend of a participant in the May/June 2007 IVLP program told IRPO that all seven of the participants in that program had their passports confiscated upon their return to Iran and face hearings at the Revolutionary Court within the next month.  They have been told they will not be allowed to travel outside Iran for a year, but the government is apparently not interfering with  their work.  It is important to note that this is the only IVLP group for Iran thus far that has faced any reprisals from the government upon their return. In related news, renowned Iranian filmmaker Kamran Shirdel issued a public refusal to attend an event (not sponsored by the USG) in the US honoring his work as a protest against USG policies toward Iran, including a likely reference to the IVLP program.  End summary.  2.(S/NF) Iranian participants in the May/June 2007 State Department's International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP) for documentary filmmakers have reportedly been subject to some government pressure and travel bans since their return to Iran, as reported by some of the participants by email to IRPoffs and a friend of one the participants (who is himself a documentary filmmaker).  The filmmakers had defied a warning from the Islamic Culture and Guidance Ministry not to participate and traveled to the US for the USG-sponsored program.  Ministry officials indicated to the filmmakers their belief that the IVLP program was political, not cultural, in nature.  3.(S/NF) Four of the IVLP participants returned from the US a few days ahead of the other three and had their passports confiscated.  They then warned the rest  but the other three chose to return to Iran nonetheless and also had their passports taken.  The friend who met with IRPoff August 15 said he suspected that one of the seven participants was a "spy" for the Iranian government, without offering a specific name.  4.(S/NF) The IVLP participants have been called before the revolutionary court for hearings, with court dates set for sometime within the next month (mid-August to mid-September 2007).  According to the friend, when the seven filmmakers attempted to travel to some European countries for film festivals, they were told that they will not be permitted to travel outside the country for one year.  The government has not otherwise interfered with the work of the IVLP participants since their return to Iran, according to the contact.  In emails from Iran, several participants have indicated to IRPoffs that they believe their problems will be resolved soon and that the benefits of the exchange outweigh the difficulties they are now facing.  5.(C) There is apparently no general travel ban to the US for filmmakers.  Two filmmakers and an actor applied for visas to the US in the past two weeks - one, the friend cited above, who is screening his short documentary in a New York film festival,and another filmmaker and one of his actors  who are planning to screen their fiction film in California.  The actor alleged that the Culture and Islamic Guidance ministry had seized the film earlier this year when they intended to screen it in the US, but they appear to have received the ministry's permission to screen the film now and they plan to travel to the US for that purpose in the coming month.  The second filmmaker said he intends to invite some Americans involved in film to Iran on a cultural exchange, and the first filmmaker told IRPoff that he would like to make a documentary about applying for a US visa.  6.(C) Comment:  Iranian government paranoia of a US-led "soft" revolution and crackdown on intellectual ties with the US means that cultural exchanges with Iran are likely to remain politicized.  It is important to note, however, that this is the only IVLP group for Iran thus far that has faced reprisals from the government upon return to Iran.  Separately, renowned Iranian filmmaker Kamran Shirdel made a veiled reference to USG cultural programs in his public refusal to attend a ceremony organized in his honor by the Asia Society in New York in October 2007 in protest of US policy.  Among other charges, he said,  the "secret programs of the US government which (they claim) are contrived to 'help' Iranian artists and intellectuals prove correct the theory that the United States does not want or  RPO DUBAI 00000052  002.2 OF 002   cannot permit other nations to choose, decide, and gain experience on their own, so it tries to subvert their values and ruin all their experiences."  As long as the Iranian government does not overtly ban participation in USG programs like the IVLP, however, at least some invitees are likely to continue to take the opportunity. BURNS

RPO DUBAI 0052; B. RPO DUBAI 0050  CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian L Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Dubai, US Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  The Iranian government seized dissident Iranian cleric Mohsen Kadivar's passport just before he boarded a plane to Dubai to apply for a US visa.  Kadivar, who has been imprisoned in the past for his theological criticisms of the Iranian system of government, was informed that the Special Court for Clergy had put a travel ban on him.  He is in the process of trying to have his passport restored so he can travel for a year's fellowship at the University of Virginia.  In light of this and several other similar cases, IRPO recommends a statement condemning the Iranian government's practice of seizing passports of some Iranians traveling to and from the US, without citing specific cases.  End summary  2.(S) The Iranian government prevented preeminent reformist religious scholar and outspoken critic of velayat-e faqih Mohsen Kadivar from leaving Iran August 16 and seized his passport.  As relayed to IRPO by a US intermediary, two hours before his flight from Imam Khomeini Airport, authorities took Kadivar's passport and told him to report the following week to intelligence to claim his passport.  Kadivar learned for the first time that in February 2007, the Special Court for Clergy had put a travel ban on him.  On August 20, he reported to an intelligence office called the "passport branch of the Presidency Office," where he was told to go to the Special Court for Clergy.  At the court, he was told to fill out an application to try to cancel the travel ban and to call August 25 for an update.  3.(S) Kadivar was on his way to Dubai to apply for a US visa to spend a year's sabbatical at the University of Virginia.  When he didn't show up for his visa appointment, IRPO informed UVA. His point of contact at UVA there later forwarded to IRPO Director Kadivar's email detailing what had happened to him. Kadivar indicated he was not optimistic that his situation will be resolved soon.  4.(U) Kadivar has written extensively on systems of government according to Shiite theology, and he has openly questioned the Islamic Republic of Iran's doctrine of velayat-e faqih.  After receiving a sentence of 18 months for his critical writings, he was released in 2000 from Evin Prison.  5.(S) Kadivar's case is one of several that IRPO has learned about in which the Iranian government has confiscated the passports of Iranians traveling to or from the US, in addition to the well-publicized case of dual citizen Parnaz Azima.  The first two sets involve either USG funded travel or links to a think tank accused by Iran of being part of the USG "soft revolution" conspiracy.  A group of Iranian documentary filmmakers returning from an IVLP program had their passports taken upon their return after they had defied authorities and participated in the program (Ref A).  Also, a political science professor, who spent a year at National Endowment for Democracy (NED) before teaching at a US university, had his passport taken away after returning to Iran on a visit. (Ref B)  He was also dismissed from his Iranian university.  Kadivar's case is somewhat different, in that the purpose of his travel is not related to any entity - USG or other - that the Iranian government has accused of promoting a soft revolution in Iran. However, what sets him apart from ordinary academic exchanges is that he is a very well-known and controversial figure in Iran.  6.(S) Comment:  UVA has asked that the USG not to make a specific public statement about Kadivar's case for the time being, out of concern that doing so could preclude a speedy resolution of his situation.  It is very likely that if the USG named Kadivar by name, the Iranian government would jump to the conclusion that we are the real sponsor of Kadivar's fellowship to the US and mostly likely Kadivar would be prevented from traveling, and possibly arrested and imprisoned  Instead, we recommend a statement on the practice of seizing passports that omits specifics.  We can expand the guidance regarding dual citizen Parnaz Azima who is in a similar situation to add language saying we also deplore the Iranian government's practice of seizing passports of some non-dual citizen Iranians traveling to or from the US.  Because the other cases involve people whose cases are not publicly known - unlike in the case of a political prisoner - and who have no other citizenship, they stand to face greater retribution if the USG identifies them publicly.  Should Kadivar - or the others - ask for such a statement, we can later supply details.  BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary: The Iranian government is stepping up efforts to exert control over the licensing of lawyers, a lawyer who works with the Iranian Bar Association told IRPO.  The contact believed the goal of such control would be to intimidate lawyers to dissuade them from taking up cases against the government. That said, the contact maintains that there is generally greater freedom of expression now for lawyers than a few years ago. This action appears to be another example of the Iranian government's indirect but insidious efforts to constrain civil society.  End summary.  2.(C) A lawyer who works with the Iranian Bar Association told IRPO that the association is increasingly worried about its independence from the government.  The contact claimed that the government is attempting to exert control over lawyers, in particular their licensing.  He said the current administration is using Article 187 of the May 2000 law on the third economic, social, and cultural development plan -- which reportedly allows the government to license lawyers independently of the bar association -- and that there are a growing number of government-licensed lawyers.  The result, according to the contact, is a growing cadre of lawyers in Iran who have undergone a very different (and less rigorous) legal training, and who are more likely to be beholden to the government.  3.(C) The contact mentioned that the International Bar Association visited Iran during summer 2007 and met with officials of the Iranian Bar Association.  (Note: A British contact who met the head of the International Bar Association after the group's trip to Iran said Iranian lawyers had expressed worry about expanded application of Sharia law in Iran.  End note.)  Legal training --------------  4.(C) Explaining the process of legal education in Iran, the contact said that students enter law school directly from high school and obtain law degrees.  According to the licensing requirements of the Iranian bar associations, following law school, prospective lawyers complete an apprenticeship with a senior lawyer for 18 months during which they also complete a thesis and attend numerous court sessions.  After that time, they take the bar exam.  There are 15 different bar associations in Iran, including one central bar association, according to the contact.  In contrast, the contact said, government-licensed lawyers are not required to do the 18-month apprenticeship or take the bar exam.  Still independent -----------------  5.(C) Despite the government attempts to exert control over the licensing of lawyers, the contact maintains that there is more freedom of expression in the legal profession now than there was four to six years ago.  For example, some lawyers have criticized the recent government crackdowns on "un-Islamic dress."  In addition, as a means of passive political protest, he and many of his colleagues do not vote and some wear ties. (Note: The wearing of ties is a clear political statement in Iran and a passive indication of defiance against a regime that has long railed against western-style clothing. End note.)  But constrained ---------------  6.(C) Speaking about rights of the accused -- or lack thereof -- the lawyer said that criminal courts have the right to deny defense counsel permission to speak with their clients during initial investigations.  They can also deny defense counsel permission to attend hearings related to their clients.  (Note: This practice is common in Iranian courts.  Those accused of crimes in Iran are frequently denied access to legal representation. End note.)  7.(C) Comment: Although the government's attempt to exert control over the licensing of lawyers appears mild compared to some of the more egregious actions of the Iranian government, it represents yet another effort to put limits on people's rights.  RPO DUBAI 00000054  002.2 OF 002   Similar to a 2006 action placing NGOs in uncertain legal status (see reftels), this action seems designed to discourage lawyers from taking up civil rights cases against the government.

REASON: 1.4 (d) 1.(S/NF) Summary:  A purported former IRGC general told IRPO Director that in his view, listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization would end any chance of cooperation in Iraq, as well as alienate many in Iran at a time of growing support for US-Iran rapprochement. He claimed the IRGC carries out orders; it doesn't write them.  He maintained that the only way to have effective negotiations with Iran was to do them in secret, in order to minimize the chance that those opposed could sabotage them.  His views of a variety of Iranian issues are also noted. End summary  IRGC listing ----------------  2.(S/NF) A purported former IRGC general told IRPO Director August 23 that in his view, listing the IRGC on a terrorism list would end all possibility of cooperation in Iraq.  There are ex-IRGC throughout government, he said, who would take such a move as a personal affront.  He said that in any case, IRGC does not decide its actions; it only follows orders.  3.(S/NF) When told of concerns that the IRGC is using its growing profits from its business activities to fund terrorism and acquisition of WMD, he claimed that these are not black accounts.  He said the IRGC has to account to the Supreme Leader for its economic activities and cannot spend these profits independently.  US-Iran relations --------------------  4.(S/NF) The former general maintained - as he has in previous meetings - that the only way to make progress between Iran and the US is secret negotiations between people very close to the leadership on both sides.  He said in Iran today, there are a few powerful people, such as Habibollah Asgaroladi, the head of the Islamic Coalition Party, who are trying to fight the growing support in the country for rebuilding relations with the US.  He said they are directing Iran's aggressive policies, including interference in Iraq.  Complicating the situation further, he maintained, many countries stand to lose if the US and Iran reconcile and are also trying to prevent such an occurrence.  In his view, secret negotiations were the only way to prevent all these actors from torpedoing the process.  Assembly of Experts -------------------------  5.(S/NF) If Rafsanjani becomes the new head of the Assembly of Experts, in the general's view, he could have the clout to reorient Iran's policies.  However, it is not certain Rafsanjani will get the position as the Supreme Leader is opposed.  The general did not expect significant policy changes if anyone else is selected.  Judiciary head Shahroudi is a good person, he said, very well educated and open-minded, but does not have the power base to influence policy.  Ahmadinejad ----------------  6.(S/NF) The general maintained that the president is losing popularity but at the same time, gaining ability to exert himself over the economy, as evidence by the recent departures of the ministers of oil and of industry, as well as the head of Central Bank.  Nonetheless, the source did not expect a major change - either positively or negatively - to the economy.  He added that few within the IRGC support Ahmadinejad.  Unrest in the provinces ----------------------------  7.(S/NF) Asked his view of the situation in Sistan-va Baluchistan, he accused the Saudis of sending in money and creating problems.  He said Baluchis are Salafi Sunnis, which he called the most anti-Shia of all.  (By contrast, he said Wahabiism was created by the British.)  Asked if IRGC are involved at all in the drug trade there, he said no.  He claimed these rumors start because members of Sepah go undercover to break up smuggling rings.  8.(S/NF) The general claimed the situation in Kurdistan was relatively stable there, and said that unlike in Turkey, Iranian  RPO DUBAI 00000055  002.2 OF 002   Kurds are well assimilated into Iranian society.  ICRO -------  9.(S/NF) The former general said he used to work at the Islamic Culture and Relations Organization (ICRO) about eight years ago, and his brother used to be the deputy there.  Technically ICRO falls under the Ministry of Ershad, he said, but in actuality, it reports directly to the Supreme Leader.  Its charge is to promote both Iranian and Islamic culture.  Its responsibilities include overseeing the cultural attachi program in embassies (the division where he worked), as well as engaging in interfaith dialogue.  He commented that former chairman Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Taskhiri is quite open-minded.   Asked about the announcements in the past about recruiting suicide bombers in Iran, he was dismissive of the reports and claimed that in fact the effort was to recruit volunteers to fight Israel, not suicide bombers.  UAE ------  10.(S/NF) Asked about Sunni-Shia relations in the UAE, he said there are no problems in Dubai, where he spends a good deal of time.  He said the situation was not as harmonious in Sharjah or Abu Dhabi, though, but did not offer examples.  He claimed that Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid speaks Farsi and had studied in Iran prior to the revolution, where the Shah gave him military training. BURNS 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000056  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  LONDON FOR GAYLE, BERLIN FOR PAETZOLD BAKU FOR HAUGEN, PARIS FOR WALLER  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: IR, PREL, PGOV, KNNP, IZ SUBJECT: PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD ATTEMPTS TO TONE DOWN TENSIONS BUT STAY FIRM IN AUGUST 28 PRESS CONFERENCE  RPO DUBAI 00000056  001.2 OF 003   1.(SBU) Summary.  "The nuclear file is closed, and we have cleared up all questions," said President Ahmadinejad in his second public press conference this year.  Ahmadinejad made it clear that Iran will continue to discuss Iraq security with the US at an ambassadorial level, stating that a secure Iraq is in Iran's best interest.  Taking questions from the international press, Ahmadinejad asserted that along with Saudi Arabia, Iran is ready to fill a power vacuum that is developing in the region.  He said that Iran also enjoys good relations with its neighbors in the Gulf and is ready to reinstate relations with Egypt.  Ahmadinejad dismissed allegations of a US military attack on Iran and a US decision to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as unlikely.  He said he personally believes that Woodrow Wilson Center scholar Haleh Esfandiari can return to the US, but in the end this is a matter for the judiciary to decide.  The tone of his speech was calm, and--though firm--less aggressive than in the past.  End Summary.  2.(SBU) In his second public address this year, President Ahmadinejad spoke for roughly 45 minutes and took questions from the national and international press August 28.  He began with an inclusive statement about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, saying each believes that a savior will come to bring justice to the world.  He stressed Muslims' belief in the Imam Mahdi, whose birthday is to be celebrated August 29.  Calling mismanagement and "bad governance" the basis of wrongdoing in the world, his address covered Iran's nuclear program and Iraq.  Following his speech he took roughly 45 minutes of questions on regional security and stability, the economic situation in Iran, and the status of jailed Iranian-American Haleh Esfandiari.  ---------- Nuclear ----------  3. (U) Ahmadinejad reiterated previous statements that Iran is working within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and that according to this framework; all nations have the right to nuclear technology.  Furthermore, he added, nuclear-capable states are obliged to help non-nuclear states attain nuclear energy.  Iran is a member of the nuclear club now because it has mastered the fuel cycle and has industrial-level production, he said.  Iran is willing to help other nations attain nuclear energy capacity, in accordance with its obligations, Ahmadinejad stated.  He accused "some powers" of not obeying the rules they have set up and using political and economic pressure against Iran.  4.(U) President Ahmadinejad said that attempts to pressure Iran and threats against it have not and will not be effective.  He called the decision to send Iran's nuclear file to the UN Security Council "illegal," and said that Iran followed the first UN resolution against it by re-opening the Natanz facility, and the second resolution by announcing industrial-scale enrichment.  Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA has been exemplary, announcing clearly that "the nuclear file is closed, and we have cleared up all questions."  He asserted that all reports of the IAEA say that Iran is operating within the regulations, and stated that is now clear that Iran's activities are peace-seeking.  5. (U) Iran's president warned the "power" against repeating its mistakes with other IAEA members, and excoriated it for "discrediting the UN."  Ahmadinejad said the behavior of the "power" has made nations distrust it.  "You have a nuclear arsenal, but no peace of mind," he said, "Why don't you get rid of it?"   He warned "statesmen who talk with the language of 60 years ago" against arrogance and bullying.  "You've done things that won't be corrected for years," he said, "but, in time, you might be forgiven."  6.(U) Responding to reporters' questions about the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad suggested that Iran does not intend to end its cooperation with the IAEA, even in the face of another UNSC resolution.  He said news reports suggesting Iran had scaled back its enrichment activity at Natanz were false and that the speed of progress of Iran's nuclear program depends solely on technical matters.  There was no political decision to slow the program, he said.  Asserting that Iran is cooperating fully with the IAEA and working within the framework of the NPT, he said however that the IAEA Safeguards Additional Protocol was an entirely different matter, inferring that Iran does not intend  RPO DUBAI 00000056  002.2 OF 003   to adhere to the Additional Protocol.  Ahmadinejad called the IAEA a "legal entity" and cautioned it against political decisions which would take it outside its mandate.  ------ Iraq ------  7.(U) Returning to the theme of mismanagement, Ahmadinejad criticized the "powers" for initially supporting and arming Saddam Hussein against Iran in the 1980s', hoping to "break Iran's national will."  These same people later opposed Saddam, he said, by coming up with "false claims of weapons."  After deposing Saddam, the "occupiers" became the sole cause of the problems in Iraq, Ahmadinejad said.  They have created problems that they cannot solve, and the longer they stay, the worse the situation will be.  When asked, Ahmadinejad denied allegations that Iran is behind the current instability in Iraq, accusing the US of trying to shift the blame for the failure of its policies, instead of analyzing its mistakes.  He said the "occupiers of Iraq" are creating instability and sectarian tensions in order to justify their presence there, adding that they want to "divide and rule, conquer the oil wealth, and create a central power base."  Ahmadinejad accused the "powers" of seeking to undermine the Iraqi government, replace the Prime Minister, and change the constitution.  Iran, he said favors a stable Iraq as the two countries share a long border, cultural connections and history.  8.(U) The political power of the "occupiers" is waning and a power gap is developing, Ahmadinejad said.  Iran is ready -- with the help of friends like Saudi Arabia and others -- to fill that power gap.  Responding to reporters' questions, Ahmadinejad called US accusations of Iranian interference in Iraq false. Asked if an apparent lack of US support for the Maliki government would affect US-Iran discussions on Iraq, Ahmadinejad said that "as long as there has been no change in request," Iran is ready to help in Iraq and continue negotiations at an ambassadorial level.  He said Iran is "ready to help you come out of this bog you have created," but that Iran would not "force you out."  Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad pressed for a US withdrawal, saying, "Let Iraqis run Iraq and go back to your country.  You are gate crashers. No one sent you an invitation. No one rolled out the red carpet."  9.(U) Ahmadinejad warned against a "new plan to pressure the Iraqi government," saying it would fail.  Referring indirectly to the US, he said those advising them in the "old colonial ways" are working against them, and advised them to sit down and review what they have done.  "Two months ago they gave arms to people," he said, "and now they've come out of the frying pan and into the fire."  There have been 600,000 deaths, Ahmadinejad charged.  "What have you achieved? Who is to blame? Who will be tried?"  The problems in Iraq can be solved without further casualties, Ahmadinejad claimed, but said the [presumably US] government does not listen to the advice of wise men and women. "Don't you have brains in your head," he asked.  --------------------------------------------- Regional security and other questions --------------------------------------------- ----  10. (U) Asked by reporters about Iran-US negotiations, Ahmadinejad said Iran is already working with the international community on Iraq security, but is ready for to talk to anyone except "the occupiers of Palestine" about broader issues if it is met on equal terms.  Equality is condition for such discussions, he said.  Ahmadinejad dismissed rumors of a US military attack against Iran, saying that the Iranian people are not worried.  Ahmadinejad said the problems in Afghanistan and Iraq would need to be solved first.  Asked to clarify French President Sarkozy's comments about a possible military attack against Iran if it continues uranium enrichment, Ahmadinejad said Sarkozy is a new president who wants to make his mark. Sarkozy's comment "has no political value," he said. Ahmadinejad focused instead on Sarkozy's call for dialogue, praising these efforts.  11.(U)  Asked whether Iran would block the Straits of Hormuz, he said it was not on the agenda, and that those who have suggested this have done it only to increase tensions and oil prices. Ahmadinejad also said he doubted that the US would designate the IRGC a terrorist organization, saying it would be "absurd" for  RPO DUBAI 00000056  003.2 OF 003   the US to take such an "extreme, illegal measure."  He said it was more a reflection of political infighting in the US between a group that is "worried" about arms sales and is trying to create tensions, and more "logical" actors.  12. (U) Asked about the possibility for renewal of ties between Egypt and Iran, Ahmadinejad said Iran was willing to send an ambassador, and that the two countries' vice foreign ministers are discussing the promotion of ties.  Asked why Iran has not pursued closer relations with the Gulf, Ahmadinejad defended Iran's diplomacy, saying it maintains friendly relations with Gulf countries.  He added that Iran's annual trade with the UAE is $11 billion.  13.(U) Asked his response to criticism of his economic policy, Ahmadinejad said people in Iran are free to express their opinions.  The economic policy was approved by the legislature, and the government is proceeding on that basis.  Investments in Iran have grown two-fold, he said, claiming that "Iran is the most secure country in the world."  Some infrastructure in the energy and transportations sectors is lacking, he admitted, saying that the government has increased investment in those sectors.  Asked whether there would be further changes in his cabinet, Ahmadinejad responded with an analogy, likening the cabinet to a football team, of which the president was the coach.  "No player can expect to stay in the game the whole time," Ahmadinejad said, stressing however, that it was still a team effort in the end.  14.(U) Asked whether jailed Iranian-American scholar Haleh Esfandiari would be allowed to return to the US, Ahmadinejad responded that personally he thinks she is free to return, but the final decision on the case lies with the judiciary.  15.(SBU) Comment.  The tone of President Ahmadinejad's second press conference this year was relatively calm and -- though firm -- less aggressive than in the past.  Ahmadinejad appeared more relaxed than in previous international press conferences, joking with reporters.  He began his speech by pointing to common beliefs among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and refrained from any strident anti-Israel comments.  He reiterated several times Iran's willingness to engage in discussions with the US, and to help in Iraq. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S//NF) Summary:  A Catholic nun living in Iran told IRPO said she leads a small group of nuns who do community work and operate under the authority of the Assyrian Church in Iran.  The nun said their ability to carry out their duties is severely limited when compared to pre-revolutionary days and that their community center is closely monitored by the Iranian government.  She said the nuns have had difficulty obtaining permission and funding to build a new community center outside of Tehran, complaining of government corruption.  She requested USG funding to complete the community center, while acknowledging the difficulty of accepting money from foreign sources.  End Summary.  2. This is an action request.  Please see para 10.  3.(S//NF) A Catholic nun who has lived 33 years in Iran, discussed with IRPoff the situation for her and her fellow sisters in Iran.  She said that she came with a small group of Catholic nuns (four Italians and one Brazilian) to Iran in 1974.  They chose to operate under the authority of the Assyrian Church, the nun said, because it was poorer and needed more help than the Armenian Church.  Less freedom than before revolution -----------------------------------  4.(S//NF) Prior to the 1979 revolution, the nuns ran a boarding school where she said many Iranian elite sent their children, as well as a clinic and orphanage, also open to non-Christians. Following the revolution, however, their school, clinic, and orphanage were closed, and today they are only allowed to run a Christian community center.  Furthermore, the community center is off limits to non-Christians.  While many foreigners were forced to leave Iran after the revolution (in part, she said, because rations were not available to non-Iranians), the nuns were able to stay because they had acquired Iranian citizenship.  (Note: It was not clear whether this is the only group of Catholic nuns in Iran. End note.)  5.(S//NF) The nuns, who currently number 6-8, are permitted to hold a mass at the center every Tuesday, performed by an Assyrian priest.  She said they also hold "underground" workshops in ceramics, computers, and foreign languages, inferring that the workshops are also attended by non-Christians.  She said that young people used to come to their workshops more freely in the past.  The nun indicated that more recently they have had difficulty attracting people to their classes and said that the organization now has to offer some incentives.  (Note: She did not indicate why interest was waning or specify what kind of incentives they offered. End note).  6.(S//NF) The nun commented that the Assyrian Church in Iran today has a fragile structure.  The Assyrian bishop in Iran is Iraqi, she said, and without Iranian citizenship he is technically vulnerable to expulsion at any time.  She also said the Assyrian church is very patriarchal.  As an example of this, she claimed that when Assyrian church officials participate in events relating to interfaith dialogue, they never invite the sisters.  She added that the nuns feel that their own situation is fragile despite their Iranian citizenship.  For example, she said they were likely to face (unspecified) repercussions if they did not vote in elections, although she did not indicate any pressure to vote for specific candidates.  She also mentioned their suspicion that the government monitors their emails and telephone calls.  Christians leaving ------------------  7.(S//NF) The nun said, similar to other sources, that there is high rate of emigration of Christians from Iran, although she did not indicate whether the reason was because of specific persecution or general economic or social pressures.  She said there is an organization in Austria that helps Christians, as well as Muslims, emigrate from Iran to the US at a cost of $3000.  She estimated the Assyrian community in Iran today to be 15-20,000. She did not give an estimate for the Catholic community, only indicating that it is very small.   RPO DUBAI 00000058  002.2 OF 002   Obstacles to a new center -------------------------  8.(S//NF) The nuns have been attempting to build a much larger community center just outside of Tehran for the past ten years but have had difficulty obtaining needed permission and funding, the nun said.  She detailed the frustrations of dealing with the municipality, which has granted them building permits, but for insufficient time frames to complete the project, and then withheld renewals for months or years.  They were also in dispute with the Agriculture ministry, which claimed they were building on land meant for agriculture.  The nun bemoaned the corruption of government officials, adding (without details) that "everything depends on the Pasdaran (IRGC)."  In addition to their woes in dealing with the government, the nun said that the costs of construction had risen significantly since the government began forcibly expelling illegal Afghan immigrants, who had provided cheap construction labor.  Reason for meeting ------------------  9.(S//NF) The nun, whose request to meet a USG official had been passed to IRPO through an Emirati contact of Embassy Abu Dhabi, solicited USG funding to complete the new community center.  She said the nuns currently have a valid building permit but lack funds to complete the project.  They have reportedly exhausted funding from the Vatican and need approximately 500,000 euros (USD 683,250) to complete the project.  IRPOff replied that USG funding for projects of this sort is uncommon, suggesting the nuns seek out Christian charitable organizations in the US and elsewhere, an idea the nun appeared not to have considered.  The nun acknowledged the difficulty they would face in bringing in any funding from the US or other countries.  She said that funding from the Vatican came through the Vatican's diplomatic pouch, but she doubted that other countries would be able to bring them funds in a similar manner.  10.(S//NF) Action request:  Please advise if the USG wants to try to pursue this request for funding for a Christian community center in Iran in any way.  IRPO does not see a direct USG interest in such a project, but the USG could  convey the details to relevant religious groups.  It is not known whether the Vatican would agree to transfer funds on behalf of another religious organization. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S//NF) Summary:  A contact who claims to have worked for three years as the deputy of new IRGC head Jafari described him as an excellent soldier, a war hero, and more moderate than his predecessor Safavi.  The contact did not think the timing of the change was linked to rumors that the US would designate the IRGC as a terrorist group.  He claimed that it was a normal rotation, actually overdue, requested by Safavi.  He also claimed that two groups had been working for Safavi's ouster: an internal group including Jafari who disagreed with Safavi over administrative matters, and an external group led by Deputy Interior Minister Zolqadr who disagreed with Safavi over political issues.  The contact clearly thought Jafari was better qualified for the job for Safavi, but at the same time noted that he thought the appointment signified that Iran was seriously preparing itself in case of military attack.  End Summary  2.(U) Supreme Leader Khamenei named Brigadier General Mohammad Ali Jafari to replace Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi as head of the IRGC September 1 and promoted him to major general. Khamenei appointed Safavi as his advisor for military affairs. (Note:  In a subsequent press interview, Safavi noted it was the first time the Supreme Leader has appointed a military commander as an advisor. Endnote)  3.(S//NF) An ongoing contact, purported a former IRGC general, said he served as Mohammad Ali Jafari's deputy for three years while Jafari headed the IRGC infantry.  The contact said he worked in the budget and planning office.  The former general clearly has a positive opinion of Jafari, describing him as a good soldier and a good man.  He said Jafari is tough, a professional soldier, a war hero, a better organizer and fighter than Safavi.  He also believed that Jafari is more moderate than Safavi and not political.  He claimed that Jafari is not in the group close to Ahmadinejad.  In his judgment, Jafari does not lie, and he thought Jafari would give the Supreme Leader realistic assessments of Iran's military capabilities.  The contact said that Jafari, an architectural engineer by training, has long been involved in the IRGC's traditional construction projects, but claimed that Jafari is opposed to IRGC's involvement in business, licit or otherwise.  Reasons for change -----------------------  4.(S//NF) The contact said that Jafari would not seek conflict but if ordered to fight, would do a better job than Safavi.  He believed the significance of the selection of Jafari to be that Iran was seriously preparing itself for the threat of war. (Note:  When asked how he thought Iran would respond in case of a military attack, the former IRGC general indicated he thought Iran would respond using both conventional and asymmetrical means.  Endnote)  The contact, similar to analysts quoted in various press reports, did not think the timing of the announcement had anything to do with press reports that the US was considering designating the IRGC a terrorist entity.  He said the replacement of Safavi was a normal rotation, that in fact Safavi had been in his position for longer than normal.  He claimed that Safavi was "tired" and had been requesting to step down for a year.  5.(S//NF) The ex-general also claimed that two separate groups had been working for Safavi's ouster.  One was a group internal to the IRGC which reportedly differed with Safavi over how the IRGC was being administered (NFI).  This group included 11 commanders, of which Jafari was the most significant one, and was supported by former IRGC head Mohsen Rezaie, now secretary of the Expediency Council.  The second, external group was reportedly led by Deputy Interior Minister for security affairs Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, formerly deputy IRGC commander, considered ultra-right wing.  This group reportedly had political differences with Safavi and thought he was too moderate.  6.(S//NF) One apparent cause of friction between Safavi and Zolqadr was Zolqadr's alleged continued dominance over the Qods Force, as well as the IRGC counter-intelligence unit.  Zolqadr, before moving to the Interior Ministry, reportedly put his own  RPO DUBAI 00000060  002.2 OF 002   people in both organizations and retains significant influence over both organizations.  The ex-general claimed Zolqadr tried to recruit him when he was in the IRGC, promising him promotions, but Safavi warned him not to join with Zolqadr.  The contact, when asked about the Ramazan force, claimed that the Ramazan Force, led by Zolqadr, operated inside Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war but indicated that this group was no longer in existence.  He also claimed that Zolqadr and his group are backing hardline cleric Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi to be the next Supreme Leader but for now do not have sufficient power to try to effect a change.  7.(S//NF) According to the contact, Jafari and Zolqadr are not close and belong to different groups, but they are not enemies, like Safavi and Zolqadr.  One area in which Jafari and Zolqadr do not agree is reportedly Zolqadr's support for IRGC business activities.  Jafari Biographic data -------------------------  8.(S//NF) According to the contact, Jafari began university a year before the revolution.  After the revolution he volunteered to fight against the Iraqis and later joined the IRGC.  While still in his 20s, he headed the Western unit at one point during the war (reportedly there were three units - Northwestern, Western, and Southern).  The contact did not think Jafari had traveled outside of Iran.  According to press reports, Jafari was one of the 24 IRGC commanders who sent a letter to then President Khatami in 1999, threatening action if Khatami did not control the student demonstrations.  According to a September 3, 2007 article in conservative Keyhan newspaper, Jafari was "active" in the US Embassy hostage-taking.  Other comments -----------------  9.(S//NF) The former general said he supports talks between the US and Iran, saying he believed Iran would take positive steps if it got a security guarantee from the US.  He made clear he had no information to confirm this but thought that the recent six month ceasefire announced by Moqtada al-Sadr in Iraq was likely the result of Iranian pressure and could be viewed as a positive outcome from the US-Iran Baghdad talks.  10.(S//NF) The ex-general said the IRGC and the regular army were set up to be complementary, with different taskings, to avoid competition.  He said they copied the US system, modeling the IRGC on the US Marine Corp.  He claimed that years ago in a private meeting, Khomeini had told them to copy the US military and focus on long-term planning "like the Americans."  11.(S//NF) Comment: While we have no way of confirming the contact's claim to have been an IRGC general and to have worked under Jafari, he was introduced by a long-time contact and appears from his comments to have a deep knowledge of the IRGC. He appeared uncomfortable only once, when IRPO Director asked about the Ramazan Force, as if he had not been prepared to talk about it.  He reportedly left the IRGC over eight years ago but claims continued contact with regime insiders.  He exhibits a clear dislike of the extreme right in Iran, calling President Ahmadinejad "crazy."

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(C) Summary: The abrupt resignation of Ali Larijani as Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) on  SIPDIS Oct 20 is being read by many observers as a move to forestall any compromises on the nuclear issue, despite the assertion of the government spokesman that Iran's nuclear policy will remain the same.  One Iranian-American political analyst said the move indicates that Iran is confident of its position and does not perceive a credible threat from the US.  An Iranian political science professor noted that the move will have implications for conservatives in the 2008 Majles elections.  Larijani's replacement as SNCS Secretary and chief nuclear negotiator is Saeed Jalili, the Deputy Foreign Minister for European and American affairs, who has been described as devout and ideologically in line with President Ahmadi-Nejad.  Jalili also reportedly served as director general of the Supreme Leader's office from 2001-2005.  2.(C) Summary cont'd: It remains to be seen whether the change was initiated by Supreme Leader Khamenei, who may feel that Larijani was becoming too compromising a negotiator, or by President Ahmadi-Nejad, in a bid to increase his control over nuclear policy.  It is notable that neither Khamenei nor Ahmadi-Nejad has made any public comments about Larijani's resignation.  Larijani will remain on the SNSC as one of the Supreme Leader's representatives.  It is not clear whether he will continue to have a role in Iranian nuclear policy, or whether he intends to run in the 2008 Majles elections or position himself to challenge Ahmadi-Nejad for the presidency again in 2009.  End summary.  -----------------------------------------  Timing of resignation unexpected  -----------------------------------------  3.(U) Iranian government spokesman Elham announced the resignation of Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Ali Larijani on October 20.  The fact of the  SIPDIS resignation was unsurprising-the rivalry between Larijani and President Ahmadi-Nejad is well known-but the timing was unexpected.  The announcement came only days after a meeting between Russian President Putin and Supreme Leader Khamenei, on the sidelines of a summit of Caspian Sea countries in Tehran. Larijani, who was reportedly not present at the Khamenei-Putin meeting, told state-run news IRNA on Oct 17 that Putin had presented a special view about Iran's nuclear program during the meeting and that Iran would study the view proposed by Putin. However, the following day President Ahmadi-Nejad directly contradicted Larijani, denying that Putin had proposed anything regarding the nuclear program.  In the resignation announcement, government spokesman Elham said that Larijani had submitted his resignation several times in the past, and that Ahmadi-Nejad had finally accepted it on this occasion. Elham said that Larijani resigned for "personal reasons" and to pursue other political activities.  --------------------------------------------- ---  Replacement announced simultaneously  --------------------------------------------- ---  4.(U) On the same day that Larijani's resignation was announced, presidential advisor Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi also announced the appointment of Saeed Jalili as Larijani's successor.  According to press profiles of Jalili, he is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and a close friend of Ahmadi-Nejad.  Jalili was reportedly born in 1965, has a PhD in Political Science (NFI) and served as director general of the Supreme Leader's office from 2001-2005. After the 2005 presidential elections, he became and advisor to Ahmadi-Nejad, and in September 2005 became Deputy Foreign Minister for European and American Affairs.  Jalili has been described as devout ideologically in line with the president.  5.(U) Some conservative MPs and newspapers have criticized Jalili's appointment, complaining of his comparative lack of experience.  Conservative newspaper Hamshahri wrote that although the resignation will not change Iran's policies, "it will influence the course of the talks.  The absence of a skilful diplomat in the talks will have serious repercussions."  RPO DUBAI 00000063  002.2 OF 003   Other conservative newspapers, including Resalat, Jam-e-Jam, and Keyhan, praised Larijani in editorials and commentaries. Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezai called Larijani's tenure "successful and productive" and that he "successfully foiled many threats using his acumen and acting within the framework of his mandate from the Leader."  MP and Majles Research Center director Ahmad Tavakoli (reportedly a cousin to Larijani) said he was "saddened" by Larijani's resignation, adding that Larijani's status and power to attain the rights of Iranians was more than that of a "deputy foreign minister with a low profile."  ---------------------------------  Changes in nuclear policy?  ---------------------------------  6.(C) Government officials have asserted repeatedly that the resignation will not result in any changes in Iranian nuclear policy.  However, several observers and analysts have commented that the change indicates a hardening of Iran's negotiating position.  Two Iranian businessmen separately told IRPOff that Larijani was likely perceived as too flexible, suggesting that Larijani had become more compromising during the course of his nuclear talks with the EU.  One Iranian-American political analyst who was based in Tehran said that the resignation means that Tehran is confident of its position on the nuclear issue and does not perceive a credible threat.  7.(C) It remains to be seen whether the change was initiated by Supreme Leader Khamenei, who may feel that Larijani was becoming too compromising a negotiator, or by President Ahmadi-Nejad, in a bid to increase his control over nuclear policy.  It is notable that neither Khamenei nor Ahmadi-Nejad has made any public comments about Larijani's resignation.  Larijani will remain on the SNSC as the Supreme Leader's representative, but this is likely simply a face-saving gesture.  The foreign ministry spokesman also confirmed that Larijani, along with Jalili, will meet EU foreign policy chief Solana as planned Oct 23 in Rome.  Beyond the Oct 23 meeting with Solana, it is not clear whether Larijani will have any further role in Iranian nuclear policy.  8. (C) Larijani's resignation and apparent abrupt diminution in status mirrors the similar fate of Iran's preceding SNSC secretary and chief negotiator on the nuclear program, Hassan  SIPDIS Rowhani.  Rowhani was similarly defrocked in July 2005, a sensitive juncture in negotiations with the EU-3, and replaced in both capacities by Larijani.  According to press reports at the time, Rowhani submitted his resignation to Supreme Leader Khamenei just prior to the inauguration of president Ahmadi-Nejad the following month.  Under Rowhani, Iran had voluntarily suspended nuclear enrichment for two years during negotiations with the EU-3.  Observers speculated that Rowhani, who was close to Khamenei and generally considered a trusted conservative pillar of the regime (much like Larijani), was removed for being too accommodating in nuclear negotiations.  ---------------------------  Election implications  ---------------------------  9. (C) The political analyst also suggested to IRPOff that Larijani may have voluntarily resigned in order to disassociate himself from nuclear policy and avoid being blamed for any serious repercussions, particularly in advance of the 2008 Majles elections.  The analyst suggested that by resigning Larijani disassociated not only himself, but also the traditional conservatives, from the more radical Ahmadi-Nejad. The analyst was not optimistic, though, about Larijani's chances of winning the 2009 presidential election, if he decided to run.  An Iranian political science professor said the resignation should be viewed in the context of the Majles elections.  He suggested that the conservatives needed an insider to "play the role of opposition," a tactic which he said was successful for them in the past.  The professor said that in the 2005 presidential election, Larijani strongly criticized Khatami-era compromises with the IAEA, while Ahmadi-Nejad's comments were somewhat more moderate.  It is not clear yet whether Larijani intends to run in the Majles elections in March, or to challenge Ahmadi-Nejad for the presidency again in 2009.  Conservative groups have had difficulty coalescing to create an electoral strategy, and Larijani may be a figure that traditionalists and moderate conservatives could rally around in the run up to the  RPO DUBAI 00000063  003.2 OF 003   March Majles elections.

Ambassador Plug was accompanied by Interior Ministry First Secretary Martijn Schot.

De Gooijer's agenda in Iran  ---------------------------              3.(C) According to the Ambassador, De Gooijer's top agenda item in Iran will be the case of a Dutch-Iranian human rights activist Abdullah al-Mansouri, who may be facing a death sentence on charges of terrorism and sedition.  The Ambassador said the Dutch embassy is not certain if a sentence has been passed yet or not, as embassy officials were denied access to the trial on the grounds that al-Mansouri is an Iranian national. (Note: Al-Mansouri is the leader of the Ahwaz Liberation Organization (ALO), an Arab separatist group.  He was arrested in Syria in May 2006 and extradited to Iran.  Family members claimed that al-Mansouri was not allowed access to legal representation during trial and that he was sentenced to death. However, Iranian officials have reportedly assured the Netherlands that al-Mansouri has not been sentenced to death.

Most helpful seemed to have been a personal appeal to the Supreme Leader and advocacy by family members inside Iran.  At the same time, IRPO noted the differences between those cases and the al-Mansouri case, in which he was charged with terrorism.  IRPOffs said they were unaware of any recent cases involving Americans charged in relation to ethnic activism.  The Ambassador took note of the comments on lobbying efforts and said he would convey them to the MFA.    5.(C) The Dutch diplomats did not mention any intention of De Gooijer to raise  Afghanistan with Iranian officials. (ref: 11/06/07 email from Embassy The Hague to NEA/IR and IRPO).    USG views of Saudi consortium proposal?  ---------------------------------------  RPO DUBAI 00000064  002.2 OF 002      6.(C) Ambassador Plug asked for USG views of the recent Saudi proposal of a nuclear enrichment consortium for Gulf countries. IRPOffs explained the proposal as it was described in press accounts, noting its differences from the Russian enrichment plan envisaged in the P5+1 package.  IRPO noted that the Saudi proposal to locate the enrichment consortium in a third country -- possibly Switzerland, according to press accounts -- does not make clear whether the enrichment technology would be controlled by the third country, or if parties to the consortium would have access to the technology.  Furthermore, the Saudi proposal does not clarify any procedures for the return or disposal of spent fuel.  In any case, Iran, in its reaction to the Saudi proposal, rejected any proposal that did not include enrichment on Iranian soil.    Dutch civil society activities  ------------------------------    7.(C) IRPO asked the Ambassador if Iran exhibited any particular recrimination against the Dutch embassy in Tehran in response to Dutch democracy programs, such as government-funded Farsi broadcasting or NGO Hivos' civil society projects.  The Ambassador replied that as far as he knew, Dutch diplomats did not face any particular harassment in Iran and described Dutch-Iran relations as "normal European," putting the UK in a different category.  Neither Plug nor Schot were certain if the Dutch-sponsored Farsi broadcast was currently on the air and if so, from where it was broadcast.    8.(C) Comment: The Ambassador stressed that the primary role of the Netherlands' diplomatic presence in the UAE was commercial, but that recently they had been asked to focus more on political issues.  First Secretary Schot appeared very well-versed in Iranian politics.  The Ambassador agreed to seek a readout of De Gooijer's trip to Iran at IRPO's request.  He mentioned he had hoped to arrange a meeting with IRPO with De Gooijer, but the DG's compressed schedule did not allow for it. BURNS

RPO DUBAI 0035; B. ABU DHABI 1823  RPO DUBAI 00000068  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  A former Central Bank of Iran (CBI) employee and analyst for an American financial management firm in Dubai discussed with Econoff current pressures facing Iranians both in Iran and Dubai.  The former banker told Econoff that a Tehran-based friend -- who produces a monthly economic newsletter for clients -- felt it necessary to meet with the Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) about his work after hearing rumors that the Iranian authorities were "after him."  The same friend reportedly approached the same Dubai-based financial analysts for assistance in moving $80 million out of Iran, with more to follow.  The contact claimed to Econoff not to know who the $80 million belonged to.  Not wanting to get involved in the money transfer, the analyst reportedly referred the friend to the British arm of the American firm, feeling compelled to help Iranians without implicating the US company.  The analyst echoed claims we have heard from other Iranians that they are facing greater difficulties obtaining work visas, business permits, and financing in Dubai - and that escalating real estate prices are driving them to alternative locations like Bulgaria (real estate market information to be reported septel).  End summary.  Mitigating MOIS suspicion  ----------------------  2.(S) A long-time IRPO contact and former employee of the Central Bank of Iran, now working as a financial analyst for an American financial company in Dubai, described to Econoff new pressures that friends are facing in Iran.  One friend is an economist and produces a monthly for-fee business newsletter (NFI).  The friend reportedly heard rumors that the Iranian authorities "were after him," because of what he was writing in his publication.  In an effort to mitigate the situation, he reportedly called the Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) and set up a meeting to go over his product.  The MOIS allegedly told him what he could and could not report on; in particular he was advised to cut all political analysis of Iran and not produce an English version of his product.  Capital outflow from Iran  ------------------------  3.(S) The analyst said that as an incentive to business, Iran recently passed a bill allowing exporters to keep 10% of their profits outside the country.  Exporters are creating false invoices, claimed the analyst; by overstating invoice totals, greater amounts can be left overseas.  The analyst then said that this same friend in Iran recently asked for assistance in moving money around of Iran, initially mentioning the sum of $30 million, then upping it to $80 million, with more to follow. The analyst claimed they would not help, not wanting to jeopardize their employment with an American company, but referred him to the British arm of the financial management firm.  The analyst claimed not to know who the $80 million belonged to.  The contact did not want to break any US laws but at the same time felt compassion for Iranians and understood their plight.  Reportedly all the analysts' friends, associates, and family members have left Iran, "if they could."  4.(S) The analyst claimed that the economist friend in Iran had data showing that $200 billion was transferred out of Iran last year.  (Note:  Similar figures have been quoted in the press, but IRPO has not been able to confirm their accuracy.  Endnote)  Dubai making life difficult for Iranians  ---------------------------------------  5.(S) The analyst repeated what other Iranians have recently said, that some Iranians are having difficulty obtaining work visas in Dubai.  One Iranian who works for an Iranian general services and trading company (with a silent Emirati partner) complained that ever since President Ahmadinejad visited Dubai May 13 (ref A), it has become harder for Iranians to obtain business licenses.  His company is reportedly still waiting on approval to move into the real estate market.  (Note:  It is not known if the UAE has officially changed its policies regarding work visas for Iranians, but has indicated interest in tightening up on Iranian travelers.  Endnote)   RPO DUBAI 00000068  002.2 OF 002   6.(S) A November 16 news article in Dubai's Gulf News said that UAE-based banks have largely stopped issuing letters of credit for trade financing involving Iran-based companies.  One banker reportedly told Gulf News that there is no UAE legal requirement for banks to take such measures but that they are acting on the basis of their own "risk perceptions and assessment."  In an October 29 meeting with Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David McCormick, UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser Al-Suwaidi said he believed the US and UN sanctions were having an impact on Iran and Iranian businesses in the UAE, claiming that the UAE had seen a decline in financial transfers from Iran in August.  Al-Suwaidi attributed the decline to two possibilities: either the Iranians were retrenching economically, or were diverting their business away from the UAE and GCC countries (ref B).  Anecdotally, Dubai-based bankers have complained about the chilling effect of UAE Central Bank guidance on doing business with Iran (presumably the UNSCR 1737 and 1747 guidance) on their business with Iranian companies.  7.(S) Comment:  The claim that MOIS is putting restrictions on economic publications is believable.  IRPO contacts working in a similar consulting field have told IRPO that to reduce government suspicion; they publish their international travel and speaking engagements on their website and take care to mention their activities to specific contacts who they know are likely to brief the government.  Nonetheless, their subscription-only newsletter continues to be produced in English and contains political analysis.  8.(S) Comment cont:  We have heard claims for several months that the UAE has periodically cracked down on residency visas and business licenses for Iranians, although there has been no policy pronouncement from the UAEG.  We have also heard that Iranians are looking to CIS countries to invest in the real estate market, partly due to the rising costs in Dubai (to be reported septel).  The Gulf news report on Dubai limiting financing for Iran, if true, also lends credence to a relative decline in the hospitable business climate for Iranians in Dubai.  9.(U) This message was cleared by Embassy Abu Dhabi.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000069  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PGOV, PROP, SCUL, IR SUBJECT: PRESS TV - IRAN'S PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ENTERS GLOBAL STAGE  REF: OSC, Oct 29,  FEA20071029384146  RPO DUBAI 00000069  001.2 OF 002   1. (SBU) Summary: Iran's 24-hour satellite English language news station, Press TV, began operations in July 2007.  It has moved quickly to establish itself through widely dispersed correspondents, a large staff in Tehran and London, aggressive recruitment of guests, and generally high quality content from at least a technical perspective.  Press TV appears to receive strong financial backing from the Iranian government.  To date, programming dealing with the US has been consistently one-sided in its criticism of US foreign policy.  In addition, a central focus of Press TV's programming has been presenting a friendlier, more moderate portrayal of Islam, starkly contrasting with the fundamentalism of "jihadis".  Despite its claim to offer an accurate picture of Iran to Western audiences, Press TV - like al Jazeera and virtually all regional media outlets in their coverage of host governments - have steered clear of directly criticizing Iranian government policies or leaders.  While Press TV continues to face many hurdles in gaining audience share in an increasingly crowded market (and presumably it is not included in any US cable packages), it represents a significant Iranian investment in "soft power" and expansion of its public diplomacy message.  Press TV, incidentally, is not shown inside Iran.  End summary.    2. (SBU) According to press reports, Press TV established its website January 2007, and went on the air as a 24-hour English-language satellite news network on July 2, 2007.  At a recent media conference in Dubai, a recent Iranian graduate of the American University of Sharjah's Communications faculty presented her observations on Press TV operations to date. According to this researcher, Press TV's staff is reportedly selected through a rigorous screening process.  Employees now number 400-plus, with more than 55 reporters based in 35 locations.  Reporters are largely citizens of the countries from which they report.  Among Press TV's current locations are Jerusalem, Gaza City, Ramallah, Beirut, Damascus, Istanbul, London, New York, and Washington.  According to its website, Press TV is carried on ten satellite systems.    3. (SBU) The CEO of Press TV is Mohammad Sarafraz, the Vice President of IRIB.  Press TV claims to offer deeper and more balanced analyses of the news than Western media outlets. According to the Iranian media researcher, Iranian officials describe Press TV as "state-owned but not state-controlled." Iranian officials occasionally appear on Press TV (mostly with English translations).  Iranian political and cultural figures have discussed Israel-Palestinian issues, US policy in the Middle East, and cultural and religious issues.  Iranian commentators appear to avoid criticism of Iranian domestic or foreign policy, although some non-Iranian panelists on various programs have challenged Iranian policy positions.    4. (SBU) An excellent assessment of Press TV programming is available through BBC Monitoring (reftel).  The key findings of this October 29 2007 report were: "The channel is a mixture of professionally-produced journalism and serious discussion, on the one hand, and sometimes amateurish, blatantly propagandistic output, on the other.  Since its launch on July 2, Press TV has been constantly critical of the US administration, particularly with regard to policies towards Iran and the Middle East in general.  It also seeks to promote an understanding of Islam as a peaceful, tolerant religion and is critical, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly, of militant, jihadi Islamism of the type associated with Osama bin Laden."    5. (SBU) Guests have included prominent figures from the fields of journalism, academia, and occasionally, government officials.  In the US, political arena representatives have been limited to former Congressional staffers and campaign organizers.  Former Department of Homeland Security director nominee Bernard Kerick appeared on the 4 Corners program as part of a panel discussion, taking a position strongly in favor of US administration on terrorism issues.    6. (SBU) Press TV is actively recruiting guests among these various institutions and organizations, including an academic Iran-focused chat group that includes most prominent Middle East and Iran experts in academia and beyond.  One interviewee (privileged info) complained that Press TV was unprofessional in  RPO DUBAI 00000069  002.2 OF 002   their selective use of his quotes and insistence of pressing the Iranian position - in this case on the Ahmadinejad visit to New York in late September 2007 - and announced that he would not talk to them again.  Other academics have also challenged Press TV's journalistic integrity, while others counter that Press TV could have positive impacts on democratization and modernization in the region similar to Al Jazeera, and that "boycotting" Press TV is counterproductive.  Finally, some scholars and former policy-makers have suggested that other mass media outlets have their own political agendas, including VOA, and that Press TV is no different.  In discussions with local media and communications scholars, officials and students at the media conference in Dubai referred to above, several indicated they view Press TV as another news outlet like Al Jazeera, MBC, and others which are collectively challenging a perceived media imbalance skewed towards long-established (and purportedly biased) Western mainstream outlets.    7. (SBU) According to the media researcher, Press TV reportedly faced early challenges gaining access to satellites for broadcast and securing press credentials for its reporters - hurdles which it has in most cases overcome at this point.  The Iranian government has invested heavily in building Press TV largely from scratch.  Whatever the amounts the IRIG has invested on Press TV, the scope, staffing, technical sophistication and general quality of Press TV operations indicate the Iranian government is committed to a serious effort to use Press TV to boost its public diplomacy outreach with the English-speaking world.  The Iranian government already funds foreign language satellite broadcasting in Arabic (two 24 hour networks, Al Alam and Al Kowthar), as well as the multi-language (primarily Azeri Turkish, Kurdish, and Urdu) network, Sahar. With these networks now in place, and the Iranian government flush with oil revenue to sustain their quality and content, Iran appears poised to reach a broad audience with an increasingly sophisticated public diplomacy message.    8. (SBU) Comment: Despite its modern look and apparent willingness to explore controversial regional issues in a relatively open manner, we can not consider Press TV as an example of increased freedom of expression within Iran.  Iran's enhanced commitment to expanding the reach of their views, and their ample use of American and other foreign guests and locations, does not seem to have reduced Iranian government paranoia about similar transborder programming by other countries.  Iran has taken active steps against VOA/Radio Farda broadcasts, including detaining within Iran a Radio Farda broadcaster, and aggressively discouraging Iranians from appearing as guests or otherwise cooperating with these outlets.  Unless and until we see Iran offering reciprocal access to US broadcasters in Iran (USG or otherwise) to that which Press TV enjoys in the US, or Press TV begins turning at least some attention on Iran's pressing issues, Press TV will remain a relatively limited anti-US propaganda tool.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary: One of IRPO's primary mandates upon commencing operations in August 2006 was the revival of US-Iran public diplomacy programming - which focused largely on supporting US-Iran educational and cultural exchanges.  In this three-part report on IRPO Year One PD programming, part I will look back on the past year's public diplomacy programs, part II will focus on Iranian reactions to the programs, and part III will look forward to the coming year and beyond.  In our first year, IRPO PAO helped send roughly 120 Iranians resident in Iran to the US on various exchange programs.  We welcomed five visiting official speakers provided through the IIP bureau, established two small grants in the UAE to advance USG public outreach to Iran, and helped support ECA efforts to establish student advising services for Iranians, and to bring Farsi instructors to the US.  Our first year saw many challenges.  Perhaps the most daunting was the Iranian government's increasing suspicion about our activities and their efforts to undermine our programs.  As we move into our second year, many challenges remain, but the foundation is in place for continued expansion of our outreach to the Iranian people through a growing range of public diplomacy programs.  End summary.  2. (C) International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP): In November 2006, 16 Iranian medical professions visited the US on an IVLP program.  This courageous group represented the first Iranian exchange visitors from within Iran since 1979.  Over the course of the year, 104 Iran-based IVLPs visited the US, touring key institutions, meeting with American peers, and immersing themselves in American culture.  Ten of the IVLP programs were Iran country specific program, and two were multi-regional programs with Iranian programs.  Program topics included Disaster Management, Visual Arts, Rule of Law, Documentary Filmmaking, Music, Substance Abuse Treatment, Women's Entrepreneurship, and Teaching English as a Second Language. (Note: Our colleagues in London and Berlin arranged 10 additional Iranian IVLP participants from among the European Iranian expatriate community.  End note.)  3. (C) The Iranian government response to the IVLP program varied, depending on the program topic, sponsoring US partners, relevant Iranian ministries, and level of media attention.  In general, the IRIG was skeptical of the intentions of all official exchange programs, but only started to take active measures to disrupt the programs later in the year (to be detailed septel).  Participants were overwhelmingly positive in describing their experience, and some positive institutional and civil society relationships were established.  A comprehensive review and analysis of Iranian government, participant, and institutional responses to the IVLP and other exchange programs will follow septel.  4. (C) Official Speaker Program: The IRPO welcomed five speakers to Dubai (and the UAE) as part of the official speaker program. Speaker themes included: Women and Science, Entrepreneurship, Documentary Film and Media Issues, and US Elections.  Because we currently maintain no institutional links with Iranian cultural and educational organizations based in Dubai, we broadened speaker focus to issues and programs of general interest.  The Abu Dhabi and Dubai PAO offices were a great source of programming and media relations support in this regard.  5. (C) Student Advising: As of September 2007, ECA had finalized its grant agreement with AMIDEAST to provide student advising for Iranians exploring higher educational opportunities in the US.  The final AMIDEAST grant envisioned most of the advising performed via online contact between prospective students and AMIDEAST Washington through online services.  In addition, the AMIDEAST student advising office in Dubai is planning to provide public outreach and advising services by appointment through a resident student advisor based in Dubai.  6. (C) Grants: IRPO PD provided two grants in FY2007.  The first was to the Dubai Community Theatre and Arts Center (DUCTAC) to provide local venue, logistical, and personnel support for staging a documentary film festival.  The IIP Bureau is providing a separate supporting grant to the US-based Artistic Director, Anisa Mehdi.  The film festival, scheduled for April 2008, will feature US, Iranian, and Persian Gulf films and filmmakers and serve as a foundation for establishing a permanent film society in Dubai.  The second IRPO PD grant in FY2007 was to George Mason University - Ras Al Khaimah's English  RPO DUBAI 00000070  002.2 OF 002   Language Program to conduct a residential TESOL training course in RAK for Iranian TESOL instructors.  Two separate two-week courses are currently planned for winter and spring 2008.  7. (C) Interaction with Media: Based upon IRPO's location in Dubai, and press and Iranian government speculation about our activities, the UAEG on occasion shared its concerns about the profile and scope of IRPO operations with Embassy Abu Dhabi.  In general, our operating guidance was to maintain a low profile. This meant limiting our interaction with local and international media based in Dubai.  At the outset, the media wanted to discuss IRPO specifically, which would be problematic for the UAEG, and consequently the US-UAE bilateral relationship.  As the year passed, media attention to the novelty of and policy motivations for IRPO's presence in Dubai abated.  8. (C) Foreign Language Teaching Assistant (Program):  In coordination with the ECA bureau and the Institute for International Education (IIE), IRPO PD supported 16 FLTA program participants during FY2007.  This valuable program brought English-speaking language instructors to American universities to teach Farsi, a language specifically targeted under the National Security Language Initiative.  While participants faced some Iranian government pressures, out of the 23 originally approved for the program, 16 eventually were able to attend.  9. (C) Comment: Given the conditions attendant to conducting Iran Public Diplomacy activities from Dubai, IRPO PD was often obliged to carefully calibrate our programming to local and policy realities.  IRPO was a start-up attempting to revive exchanges after a 27 year hiatus.  Given this, we were obliged to learn through trial and error at times.  One IVLP alumnus offered a telling analogy on this point, suggesting that navigating any form of US engagement with Iran - even if limited to educational and cultural exchanges - was like navigating a mine field.  Even one mistake can be disastrous.  Having cleared at least part of this minefield intact through our first year of operations, we learned many lessons.  We will comment on Iranian reactions in part II of our review, and Part III will outline lessons learned and some suggestions as we move forward.  End comment. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)   1.(C) Summary: Although campaigning for the March 14, 2008 Majles elections is not officially allowed until two weeks prior to the elections, Iran is already very much in election mode. Both reformists and conservatives are attempting to create broad electoral coalitions.  Reformist parties have urged former President Khatami to run;  while he has called on reformist groups to unite, he has consistently declined to run himself. Nonetheless, Khatami still appears to be the leading figure around whom reformists are rallying.  Reformists appear opposed to any electoral boycott; one reformist privately expressed concern that the reformist cause could be undermined if the USG encourages a boycott.  The lynchpin issue for the 2008 Majles elections will clearly be the economy; both conservatives and reformists are criticizing the Ahmadinejad government's economic performance.  While the international crisis over the nuclear issue will likely play into votes, the upcoming elections promise to be even more about the price of bread than the last one.  A look at the conservatives' approach to the elections will be reported septel.  End summary.  Reformists try to build coalition  ---------------------------------  2.(C) Campaigning for Majles elections is not officially permitted until two weeks prior to the elections, which are scheduled for March 14, 2008.  Nonetheless, Iran is already very much in election mode.  With four months left, reformists appear to have been somewhat more successful to date than conservatives at building an electoral coalition.  Former Majles speaker Mehdi Karrubi has, however, thus far kept his National Trust Party out of the larger reformist coalition, a tactic some groups charge may damage reformists in the elections.  Karrubi has long viewed himself as a distinct from the main body of reformists, leading him to set up his own party.  Despite the National Trust Party keeping its own electoral list, Karrubi has maintained publicly that "90% of those in our list are coordinated with the reformists."  3.(C) Several reformist parties, including the National Trust Party, have publicly urged former President Khatami to run for a Majles seat, but he has consistently declined.  He has nonetheless urged reformist groups to consolidate their efforts for the elections.  An official of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) said in an interview on a reformist news site that if Khatami does not run for the Majles, they will urge him to run again for the presidency in 2009.  Khatami reportedly plans to make a series of provincial visits, which some observers are reading as possible campaign stops.  Whether or not he runs, it is noteworthy that despite being criticized while in office as ineffectual, Khatami appears to be the leading figure around whom reformists are rallying.  According to contacts, other possible reformist presidential candidates are former vice president Hamid Reza Aref and former science minister Mostafa Moin.  Reformist strategy is to run big names and encourage voting  --------------------------------------------- -------------  4.(S) A reformist MP asserted that if there were free and fair elections, the Majles would be split 70-30 between reformists and conservatives.  He said the goal of the reformists for the 2008 elections is to win 50% of the seats, although a minimum of 100 of the 290 seats would still be considered good.  The MP claimed that the electoral strategy of the conservatives is to encourage internal divisions among reformists and added that conservatives are relying on the Guardian Council to disqualify scores of reformist candidates.  5.(S) A Dubai-based businessman who claims to be involved in reformist politics, said that reformists are putting forward prominent, well-known former government and parliamentary officials in order to make it more difficult for the Guardian  RPO DUBAI 00000071  002.2 OF 003   Council to block their candidacies.  He said this is the opposite of the reformist strategy in the December 2006 municipal elections, when reformists put forward no-name candidates in hopes that their anonymity would give the Guardian Council no grounds on which to bar them from running.  The businessman predicted that the current strategy would be more successful, as Iranians tend to favor well-known quantities.  6.(U) The centrists appear to be adopting a similar strategy, although it is not yet clear whether they will join the reformist coalition electoral list or remain separate.  The electoral list of the centrist Rafsanjani-affiliated Executives of Construction party includes prominent figures such as former nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani, former Iranian ambassador to France Sadegh Kharrazi, and Rafsanjani's brother Mohammad Hashemi, among others.  Political scientist Farideh Farhi posited in a November editorial that this "powerful" electoral list is intended to make it difficult for the Guardian Council to disqualify its candidates since many are former government officials and key policymakers.  7.(S) The reformist MP told IRPOff that another part of the reformist strategy is to encourage voter participation, as conservatives would benefit if the "silent majority" does not vote.  The MP implied that he did not favor a boycott, even if the conservative Guardian Council disqualifies many reformist candidates.  The MP claimed, however, that Karrubi has threatened to boycott the elections if there are massive disqualifications. (Note: There has been no indication in the press that Karrubi intends to urge an election boycott if there are massive disqualifications.  In a March 2007 interview, Karrubi characterized a previous boycott as being responsible for reformist electoral defeat. End note.)  Concern over possibility of US call for boycott  --------------------------------------------- --  8.(S) The Dubai-based businessman was weighing the risks of returning to Iran to help organize the reformist electoral campaign in a province outside Tehran.  He expressed to IRPOffs his concerns that the reformist cause could be undermined if the USG encouraged an election boycott using Farsi-language VOA and Radio Farda broadcasts, as he felt the US had in the 2005 Iranian presidential elections.    Commentary on elections/electoral strategies  --------------------------------------------  9.(U) Iranian political scientist Sadeq Zibakalam predicted in a domestic newspaper interview that excessive disqualifications of candidates by the Guardian Council could lead to decreased voter participation.  He commented, "The principle-ists [i.e. conservatives] are like tight-rope walkers who are treading on a very thin rope. If they make extensive use of expedient supervision, they risk losing public participation; if they don't, their opponents will take the Majles.  I predict that they will disqualify prominent reformist personalities and allow minor ones to run, hoping that they lack name recognition."    It's the economy, stupid  -------------------------  10.(C) The key issue in the March Majles elections, and likely also in the 2009 presidential elections, will be the domestic economy.  Both conservatives and reformists are criticizing the Ahmadinejad government's economic policies, a somewhat distinct issue from the economic pressures from nuclear-related sanctions.  Conservative deputy Majles speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar said that the most important challenge faced by principle-ists is controlling inflation.  The secretary general of the reformist IIPF, Mohsen Mirdamadi, strongly criticized the  RPO DUBAI 00000071  003.2 OF 003   Ahmadinejad government's economic performance, saying, "What our people currently see through heavy propaganda launched by official and unofficial media about unrivalled achievements of the country in all fields is excessive prices, unbridled inflation, reducing economic growth, declining standards of living and loss of hope in future."  11.(S) Background: Asked about the procedure for candidacy, the reformist MP said a potential candidate must have approval from four parts of the government: the ministry of intelligence; the judiciary (ensuring that there are no corruption charges against the candidate); the education ministry (candidates must have a university degree to be eligible); and the law enforcement forces (verifying that the candidate has no criminal record). The MP also said that the government does not fund or subsidize campaigns in any way, but did not elaborate on sources of campaign funds.  12.(C) Comment: The upcoming elections in Iran promise to be even more about the price of bread than the last election. Although some reformists have criticized the government's nuclear policies in their speeches, the nuclear issue is not the driving issue in these elections.  If reformist groups manage to create a united electoral strategy, and appeal effectively to public dissatisfaction over the economy, they may stand a good chance of increasing their numbers in the Majles.  While predictions about results are still premature, the idea that reformists may regain the Majles is perhaps overly ambitious. Although early indications of coordinated cooperation on the elections between Karrubi, Khatami, and Rafsanjani, have reportedly eroded due to personal differences between Karrubi and Rafsanjani, the three do not appear to be working at cross-purposes.

She maintained that any US or allied military attack on Iran would result in an upsurge of nationalist sentiment, strengthening Iranian hardliners.  Ms. Ebadi asserted that the most effective way to pressure Iran on human rights would be to bring a case against them in the International Criminal Court (ICC).  She advised the US to change its policy and support the ICC, and in the meantime to work with partners to bring a case against Iran.  Ms. Ebadi emphasized that USG public statements in support of Iranian human rights and democracy activists are helpful and that the USG should continue to make such statements.  Ms. Ebadi dismissed the importance of the March 2008 parliamentary elections, blaming the unelected Guardian Council for impeding any reform efforts.  Ms. Ebadi said that she would stay in Iran until April 2008, when she would join her daughter in Atlanta. Ms. Ebadi indicated that she remains dedicated to human rights promotion and will continue her work on that front.  End summary.  2.(S) On November 30, Ms. Shirin Ebadi and her husband, Javad Tavassolian (strictly protect), attended an immigrant visa interview at the US Embassy Abu Dhabi consular section.  She had self-petitioned for the visa as an extraordinary ability alien, based primarily on her receipt of the 2003 Nobel Peace prize. After the conclusion of her interview, she was invited to meet with the Ambassador.  The Ambassador arranged a meeting between Ebadi and IRPOffs.  Press Iran on Human Rights through the ICC  --------------------------------------------- -------------- -------  3.(C) Ms. Ebadi and her husband were relaxed and cordial.  Ms. Ebadi was direct in her statements regarding the Iranian government's failings and had clear suggestions to pass along to the USG.  Ms. Ebadi asserted that the Iranian government would feel severe international pressure if a case were opened against them at the International Criminal Court, which she said had made a major impact on the Sudanese government.  Since the US is not a signatory to the ICC, she recommended that others could take the lead.  (Note:  She also advised that the US should change its policy and support the ICC. End note.)  She believed that USG statements in support of jailed dissidents were helpful in securing their fair treatment.  Various cases  -----------------------  4.(C) Asked about the recent statement by her NGO, the Center for the Defense of Human Rights, which named persecution of Baha'is as one of the main human rights abuses by the government, Ms. Ebadi confirmed that the human rights situation for Baha'is in Iran is very poor.  Regarding the significance of the government re-opening the investigation into the death of Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, she said that the announcement of a new investigation was just a show.  She expressed little hope that justice would be served in this case, and reiterated accusations that Tehran General Prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi was involved in the death of Zahra Kazemi.  5.(C) Asked about Mortazavi's recent overturn of a court decision finding former nuclear negotiator Hossein Musavian not guilty of espionage, Ms. Ebadi confirmed that Mortazavi has the legal authority to overturn court decisions, but said this authority is very rarely used.  She described Mortazavi as a powerful and influential figure who has better relations with the Supreme Leader than Judiciary head Ayatollah Shahrudi.  Nuclear: Iran should suspend, US should continue diplomatic pressure  --------------------------------------------- -------------- --------------------  RPO DUBAI 00000072  002.2 OF 002    6.(C)  Ms. Ebadi emphatically asserted that any US or allied military attack on Iran would result in an immediate upsurge in nationalist popular feeling and rallying around the government, strengthening the hardliners.  She said the US should continue to rally diplomatic pressure on Iran, and Iran should suspend uranium enrichment in line with UN Security Council resolution demands.  (Note: Ms. Ebadi made this statement publicly earlier in November, in line with her general call to honor the mandates of international law. End note.)  Majles elections unimportant, Guardian Council impedes reforms  --------------------------------------------- -------------- --------------------  7.(C) Ms. Ebadi dismissed the importance of the March 2008 parliamentary (Majles) elections as long as the Guardian Council supervised both the vetting of candidates, the elections, and had final say on all legislation.  She noted that in former President Khatami's second term, the reformists controlled the parliament, but no meaningful reforms were instituted because the Guardian Council blocked all significant legislation.  Ms. Ebadi added that she and other rights activists and groups have long lobbied for changes in laws including those on stoning, torture, and legal equality for women, but the Guardian Council consistently blocked any efforts by the Majles to change these laws.  Without a change to the role and powers of the Guardian Council, the prospects for any real reform in Iran were negligible, she said.  8.(C) Comment: Ms. Ebadi said that she would stay in Iran until April 2008, when she would join her daughter in Atlanta. Ms. Ebadi indicated that she remains dedicated to human rights promotion and will continue her work on that front.  9.(U) This message was cleared by Embassy Abu Dhabi. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: As reftel details, the Department restarted US-Iran official exchanges in August 2006, featuring the flagship USG exchange program, the IVLP.  The Iranian government became aware early on of USG funding for the IVLP and, even for the first program in November of 2006, issued written and oral warnings against IVLP participation.  Iranian government attention continued in varying degrees, largely depending on the subject matter and institutions involved, throughout the year. Attrition for various reasons, particularly anxiety over Iranian government reaction, thinned the participant field for some of the programs.  Despite these obstacles, Iranians participated in record numbers and spread the word widely about their positive experience with America after returning home.  Some alumni faced IRIG retaliation for being "friends of America", but continued to strongly support the positive impact of continued US-Iran exchanges.  The experience of returning alumni also helped reveal fissures within Iranian society which can help inform future PD programming.  End summary.    2. (C) As soon as IRPO was anounced, generalized IRIG paranoia about IRPO and US policy towards Iran led them to label our exchange programming as part of US "regime change" efforts aimed at fostering a "velvet revolution" in Iran.  (As recently as November 2007 the Iranian government specifically referred to the US government's Dubai office as the focal point of the USG regime-change program.)  Given this context, and the novelty of reestablishing such exchanges after a 27-year hiatus, the number of Iranian IVLPs in our first year nonetheless exceeded expectations to become the top IVLP program in the NEA region and third worldwide (see ref).  Program participants have been effusive in their praise of the quality and value of their exchange programs, and have been key supporters of further engagement with the Iranian people.  Alumni have both suggested future participants and volunteered to help organize future programs.  In addition, they have spoken in glowing terms about the American people they met and institutions they visited.    3. (C) We expect IRIG scrutiny to remain in FY2007, possibly increasing or decreasing based upon the state of bilateral tensions and the subject matter of the program.  We also expect Iranians to continue to participate, although recruitment under current conditions will remain challenging.  To offer a more textured view of the impact of and challenges to US-Iran exchange programs, we offer the following in-depth discussion with an IVLP alumnus detailed below.  It offers useful insights into how exchanges can help to mobilize and empower "friends of America" within Iran and help identify and exploit fissures within Iranian society to advance USG policy goals.    "Friends of America" - An IVLP Case Study  -----------------------------------------    4. (C) In late November 2007, one of last year's International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) participants, Dr. Farhad Towfighi (strictly protect) came to Dubai to discuss his post-exchange experience with IRPO.  Tofighi had been an employee of the Iranian Red Crescent Society's Relief Services branch.  He played an active role in delivering emergency medical care after the 2003 Bam (Iran) earthquake and the 2004 Samarra (Iraq) mosque bombing.  Nonetheless, the IRC leadership retaliated forcefully against him after he participated in the April/May 2006 Disaster Response Management IVLP.  On the other hand, other government officials and organs were neutral to supportive of Dr. Towfighi and the program generally, reflecting nuanced diversity among different elements of the Iranian government towards engaging with the US.    5. (C) As told to IRPO, when Dr. Towfighi - then still an IRC employee - was invited to the IVLP, he arranged to meet with the IRC President, Dr. Seyed Massoud Khatami (no relation to former President Khatami), to explain the program and solicit his support.  He even brought a copy of the IVLP program description for review.  The IRC Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS) liaison officer was present.  A representative from President  RPO DUBAI 00000001  002.2 OF 003   Ahmadinejad's Office, Dr. Biroudian (FNU), also attended.  While Dr. Biroudian was "very supportive" of the program, IRC President Khatami angrily rejected any such engagement with America and remained opposed to the program.  He was reportedly skeptical about the intent of the "L" (leadership) in IVLP, asking why the Americans were trying to recruit leaders in Iran.  (Note: Tofighi suggested dropping the L from future program materials if possible.)  Dr. Towfighi noted to IRPOff that Khatami was a former IRGC officer, and like the rest of the senior government officials with IRGC backgrounds appointed under Ahmadinejad, he was ideologically hostile to the US.    6. (C) Despite the IRC President's opposition to the program, Towfighi went ahead and secured official leave to participate in the program, based somewhat on reassurances from Dr. Biroudian. He also briefed the Ministry of Health regarding the program and was told that the MOH had "no reaction".  The MFA was apparently supportive.  During the first week of the IVLP in Washington, Dr. Towfighi and his colleagues attended a dinner with the head and deputy head of the Iranian Interests Section.  At this event, Dr. Rahmanian of the Interests Section (title unknown) told the group that the communication offered by the program was "interesting", and that he was "very supportive" of the program.     7. (C) According to Towfighi, the IRC remained angry about his participation and waited to retaliate after his return to Iran in early May.  First, he was summoned to the IRC security office and coercively interrogated for nine hours.  A few weeks later he was required to appear at an administrative hearing which resulted in him being fired him from his position with the IRC and banned from teaching.  The authorities also forced him to repay all income he had derived from teaching over the past year (upwards of 15,000 USD, a large sum in Iran, even for a doctor).  According to Tofighi, the IRC security officials offered him more lenient treatment if he agreed to denounce another IVLP participant, Dr. Noorbala, who was the President of the IRC during President Khatami's administration and the de facto leader of the IVLP group.  Dr. Towfighi refused to do so.  When IRC officials asked him specifically about his exchange experience, he described the trip as professionally useful, and the Americans he met as professional, kind, generous and friendly.  The IRC President grew even more displeased.    8. (C) Taking their retaliation a step further, the IRC then reportedly banned possession or distribution of any of the eight books Dr. Towfighi had written on disaster relief operations, including sending notices to all 600 IRC offices throughout Iran's 30 provinces to remove these materials.  The IRC even visited IRC offices countrywide to ensure his books were removed from shelves.  He learned later from colleagues that while removing the books, IRC security officials warned staff that "this is what happens to friends of America".    9. (C) Dr. Towfighi fought back.  He hired a lawyer and appealed the IRC's ruling to the Supreme Administrative Court.  The Supreme Court awarded him damages for lost income from the banning and removal of his books.  He is currently appealing the other aspects of the IRC ruling as well.  Dr. Tofighi's story confirms that at least some means of redress are available through the Iranian courts.  Also, he reported that lobbying influential government and NGO officials can be at least somewhat effective in curbing hardliner conduct.  Dr. Towfighi said that he had argued his case with the Swiss Embassy, the MFA, the International Red Cross, and the Ministry of Justice about his case.  In addition, he was planning to speak with the Presidential Office official who had been supportive of the exchange at the outset.  Dr. Towfighi reported that ICR colleagues had responded very negatively to the ICR's crackdown on such a long-serving and respected member of their ranks (Towfighi had worked for IRC for 23 years), and many within the organization were rallying to his support and against the IRC President.  He claimed that a teaching colleague had even thrown a student out of his class when he learned that the student was an IRC employee in anger over Towfighi's plight.  Towfighi now works in a low-profile part-time teaching position.    RPO DUBAI 00000001  003.2 OF 003    10. (C) Comment: Towfighi's case is not the only example of problems faced by returning IVLP participants.  A few other participants have lost their positions or had their passports confiscated upon return.  Fortunately, they seem to be the exception rather than the rule, and even some of these people continue to keep in contact with us and help organize further exchanges.  The Towfighi case offers key insights into methods of suppressing dissent, or even engagement with the outside world, used by hardliners in Iran.  It further illustrates that redress through the courts and lobbying with influential figures can be effective to some extent in defending one's rights. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it suggests that attitudes towards engagement with the West, in particular the US, vary within the government, both among (and within) different Ministries, and between senior leadership and the rank and file.  We should use our public diplomacy tools to strengthen the hand of those supportive of engagement.  The primary fault line exists between the mass of the Iranian people and even a large portion of Iranian officialdom who want engagement with the outside world versus hardliners and their supporters opposed to any opening which risks their monopoly on power and their vision of a pure Islamic society.  As the Towfighi case illustrates, PD tools can meaningfully influence changes within Iranian society of benefit to American policy goals.  Part III of the IRPO PD Year 1 series will offer concrete recommendations for most effectivly using these tools to advance our Iran policy goals in 2008 and beyond. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  Due to gas cuts from Turkmenistan, northern and northwestern parts of Iran have been facing gas shortages since December 29; which in turn has forced Iran to cut its gas exports to Turkey (reftels).  The Guardian UK reported 22 January that at least 64 Iranians have died due to gas shortages in freezing temperatures.  Iranian political and economic analysts initially joined the government in blaming Turkmenistan for their woes, claiming that Turkmenistan is looking to secure a higher price for its gas.  After more than 3 weeks of persistent shortages, however, blame has shifted to the Oil Minister and President Ahmadinejad, with the Supreme Leader siding with the Majles and forcing the government to provide gas supplies from emergency gas funds.  President Ahmadinejad is taking a significant political hit for his initial refusal to dip into emergency reserves for northern Iran which is suffering from a particularly cold winter and record snowfalls.  The longer the shortages persist during the winter months, the less popular Ahmadinejad will be in the northern provinces.  End Summary.  Turkmenistan cuts its gas supplies to Iran  ------------------------------------------  2.(U) Managing Director of the National Iranian Gas Company Seyed Reza Kasayeezadeh announced December 30 that as of 1030 December 29, Turkmenistan had halted its gas exports to Iran. Kasayeezadeh called on Iranians to temporarily curb their consumption in a bid to make up for the shortages felt most significantly in northern Mazandaran province.  Kasayeezadeh confidently asserted that gas imports would resume within 24 hours, as Turkmen officials blamed "repair and maintenance operations" for the "temporary" halt of gas supplies to Iran.  3.(U) In the face of gas shortages Iran, in turn, reduced its gas exports to Turkey by 75% January 1 and then cut them off completely January 7.  Embassy Ankara reported January 8 that according to press reports, Iran said it had no choice but to cut off its supplies to Turkey to make up for its own domestic shortages due to the Turkmenistan losses (ref A).  4.(U) Over three weeks into the cuts, the Guardian UK reported 22 January that at lest 64 people have died in Iran due to the gas shortages in the freezing winter temperatures.  Blame shifts from Turkmenistan to IRI government  --------------------------------------------- ----  5.(C) One Iranian political and economic analyst, in a 14 January industry publication, echoed other reports that Iran believes the reason for the halt is an attempt by Turkmenistan to secure a higher price for its gas.  According to the analyst, Turkmenistan's move has led to an impasse between the two countries, with Iran's oil minister refusing to hold talks on the issue until Turkmenistan resumes its exports, while Turkmen officials are refusing to talk until Iran pays higher prices for its gas imports. (Note:  According to RFE/RL Iran is currently paying Turkmenistan $75 per 1,000 cubic meters, while Turkmen officials are asking for $140.  Asian news sources reported 21 January that China just signed a deal to import natural gas from Turkmenistan at $195 per 1,000 cubic meters.  Endnote)  6.(U) Continued shortages and mounting death tolls are forcing Iranians to look at internal fixes instead of blaming Turkmenistan for its woes.  Rooz Online reported 21 January that Oil Minister Nozari was called before the Majles to answer to the shortages.  Guardian News UK reported 22 January that President Ahmadinejad suffered a "serious blow" after Ayatollah Khamenei sided with the Majles, requiring him to supply the villages suffering from power cuts with cheap gas.  The Supreme Leader ordered the enactment of a law requiring the government to provide $975 million worth of gas supplies from emergency reserve funds.  Ahmadinejad had reportedly initially refused to implement the bill, accusing the parliament of exceeding its powers in passing the legislation.  7.(C) Comment:  President Ahmadinejad stands to be the biggest loser in this latest energy shortage.  His political backing comes largely from the provinces, not the capital.  The longer the northern provinces suffer from gas shortages during the cold  RPO DUBAI 00000002  002.2 OF 002   winter, the more unpopular Ahmadinejad will become in the run-up to the March parliamentary elections.  This could have a negative impact on candidates seen as aligned with him.  It is also noteworthy that the Supreme Leader publicly criticized Ahmadinejad for the first time on such a sensitive issue, as he has long expressed public support for the President.  8.(C) Comment continued:  The irony that Iran is suffering gas shortages and needs to import gas even though it is home to the second largest gas reserves in the world, has not escaped the attention of the Iranian public.  With the population calling for gas to remain within Iran it will be difficult for Iran to make good on its promised exports until it receives foreign investment and technology in the natural gas sector.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary:  President Ahmadinejad presented his budget for the Iranian year 1387 (March 2008-March 2009) to parliament January 7.  Appealing to the electorate ahead of the March parliamentary elections, Ahmadinejad again shopped the idea of redistributing oil wealth and raised total expenditures by 19%. This year's budget however, streamlined compared to years past, is creating quite a controversy.  Many MPs are declaring it violates sections of the constitution and that it does not provide a clear break down of sources of funding and how those funds will be used.  The Director of the Majles Research Center Ahmad Tavakoli said MPs have three options:  reject the budget altogether; try to amend the budget; or use the 1386 budget and simply adjust for inflation.  Etemaad-e-Melli reported January 22 that MP Naderan of the Majles budget and planning commission said the budget bill is one issue in which the government will have a taste of more Majles disagreement.  End summary.  The new budget  ---------------  2.(SBU) President Ahmadinejad submitted his 2008-2009 (Iranian year 1387) budget bill to the Majles January 7, calling it the "operational directive" for the government, according to press reports.  The 600-page bill was drastically shortened from the thousands of pages presented in previous years; a move the president said will make the document more comprehensible and transparent.  Zawya reported January 23 that the budget bill projects a 19% increase in total expenditures to a record $295.6 billion, up from $248.8 billion.  Appealing to the electorate ahead of the March parliamentary elections, Ahmadinejad told the Majles that ordinary people expect to benefit from record oil prices and "the government and parliament cannot stay indifferent to this expectation...we need to redistribute the oil money to the people."  Numerous contacts have said that there is a growing frustration inside Iran, not with poverty per se, but with the increasing disparity of wealth and the declining middle class.  Multiple sources have said a greater number of BMWs and Mercedes luxury vehicles can be seen on the streets of Tehran.  (Note:  Due to tariffs such vehicles are $200,000-$250,000 and are reportedly purchased via upfront cash transactions.  Endnote)  3.(SBU) The president balanced the budget based on an oil price basis of $39.70/barrel, an 18% increase over last year's budget, but well below current oil prices which are close to $100/barrel.  According to Zawya, the president said that the budget would need $36 billion in foreign currency, which will cover petroleum imports and the cost of developing public transport.  Critics of the bill  -------------------  4.(C) According to a political/economic analyst within Iran, the 1387 budget is generating "important" controversy, with many MPs claiming it violates the portion of the constitution dealing with budget preparation and governmental accounting.  5.(C) Parliamentarians are concerned that the government has not provided a clear, transparent break-down on where the monies are coming from and how they will be spent, said the analyst. Reportedly, many Majles members are worried that the document gives an unprecedented free hand to the cabinet ministries to spend their budgets as they see fit.  This is not only in violation of the law, argue the MPs, but it also reduces parliamentary control over government spending - a point that is particularly salient if the new parliament elected in March 2008 is controlled by opposition groups, said the analyst.  (Comment:  It seems unlikely that reformers will regain control of the Majles.  Election coverage to be reported septel.  End comment)  6.(SBU)  Tehran's conservative MP and Director of the Majles Research Center Ahmad Tavakoli, said the parliament has three available options in regards to the budget:  -- reject the budget altogether.  However the government would then not have enough time to prepare a new document before year's end (March 19).  -- amend the budget and send it back to the government for  RPO DUBAI 00000003  002.2 OF 002   review.  Many favor this approach in parliament, however the current administration has rarely accepted criticism from parliament.  If the Majles opts for this option, Majles Speaker Haddad-Adel has reportedly been given the task of convincing Ahmadinejad to accept the amendments with the promise that the Majles will move quickly to ratify the budget.  -- scrap budget 1387 and adjust the 1386 budget (2007-2008) budget for inflation.  7.(SBU) Etemaad-e-Melli reported January 22 that MP Naderan of the Majles budget and planning commission said he personally believes the budget bill will not be rejected but will undergo drastic changes in form and content.  He said that the budget bill is one issue in which the government will have a taste of more Majles disagreement.  8.(C) Comment.  The president's economic critics will most likely not approve of the new budget.  With inflation officially running at 19% (according to Iran's Central Bank) and liquidity growth at 40% last year, the 19% increase in government spending will only add to inflationary pressures.  However it does not appear that Ahmadinejad will curb his spending any time soon, as it is a favored tool of his to buy voters, particularly in the provinces.  The current administration has chronically failed to invest their oil windfall revenues in economic programs that could assist with long-term economic growth and stability, in favor of myopic short-term handouts.

The MP claimed that reformist candidates would not contest their disqualifications and would instead opt to boycott the elections.  He predicted fewer than 30% overall voter participation.  The MP himself learned recently that he had been disqualified despite having already served two terms in the Majles, and was visibly shaken by the news.  He asserted that there was no longer any hope of free and fair elections, and although Supreme Leader Khamenei might intervene to allow a paltry few reformers to participate for the sake of appearances, none of the reformist candidates would go along with this transparent ploy.  End summary.  REFORMERS FACE MASSIVE INITIAL DISQUALIFICATIONS  --------------------------------------------- ----------  2.(S//NF) IRPOffs met January 22 with an Iranian reformist Majles deputy (MP) who had learned very recently that he had been disqualified from running for re-election in the upcoming Majles elections March 14, and was still visibly shaken by the news. Despite his two-term incumbency, the MP said he had been disqualified along with a majority of other reformist candidates.  Reform groups expected some disqualifications of their candidates, as in previous elections, but the MP asserted they were nonetheless surprised by the wide scale.  3.(U) According to press reports, members of two of the largest reformist groups, the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) and the Mojahideen of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO) were disqualified along with several reformist incumbents. Several members of the reformist National Trust Party were also reportedly disqualified.  WILL REFORMERS BOYCOTT THE ELECTIONS?  --------------------------------------------  4.(S//NF) The MP claimed that reformist candidates would not protest their disqualifications and would now boycott the elections.  He predicted that fewer than 30% of eligible voters would turn up at the polls.  However, a spokesman for the reformist coalition told domestic news Jan 22 that the coalition is still considering whether to boycott the elections.  NO CHANCE NOW OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, MP SAYS  --------------------------------------------- -----------  5.(S//NF) The MP asserted that there was no longer any hope of free and fair elections, claiming that the ruling conservatives were employing a five stage strategy to prevent reformers from re-taking the Majles:  --disqualifications  --disrupt reformist campaign events  --send out "night letters" on eve of vote, smearing reformers  --ballot stuffing and other voter fraud on election day  --no confidence votes  The MP asserted that Majles speaker Haddad-Adel had no chance of winning his constituency in Tehran, claiming if he won, it would be a sign that the elections had been completely rigged.  The MP suggeQ that Supreme Leader Khamenei might intervene to allow a paltry few reformers to compete, for the sake of appearances. The MP claimed, however, that none of the reformist candidates would go along with this transparent ploy.  GUARDIAN COUNCIL STILL TO REVIEW CANDIDATES  --------------------------------------------- -----------   RPO DUBAI 00000004  002.2 OF 002   6.(U) These initial disqualifications were not done by the Guardian Council, which has yet to see the candidates' applications.  The applications were first reviewed by electoral supervisory commissions.  According to the head of the Interior Ministry elections headquarters, close to 40% of the approximately 7,200 candidates who registered were found to have criminal or legal records.  He did not elaborate further about the kinds of records which resulted in initial disqualification by the electoral commissions.  Disqualified candidates will have more than one opportunity to protest their disqualifications. Candidates can issue their protests between January 23-26; the electoral commissions will then consider the protests between January 27-February 3.  Rejected candidates can protest again between February 3-22, at which point the Guardian Council will review the appeals. Candidates can appeal disqualifications by the Guardian Council between February 23-26.  Final results will be announced March 5.  7. Comment:  Heavy-handed disqualifications of reformist candidates in these elections have long been expected, and are likely to continue throughout the remainder of the vetting process.  A reformist boycott of the elections could be significant if it results in low voter turnout on election day. High voter turnout is viewed by many as an indication of systemic legitimacy, and the government has always strongly encouraged voter participation.  If there is low voter turnout due to a boycott, international criticism about the freedom and fairness of elections in the Islamic Republic might resonate more strongly with the Iranian public.

For example, he asserted, the Iranian government did not observe World AIDS Day on December 1, 2007.  Although Iran's AIDS-related programs have improved in the past six years according to the doctor, there continues to be tremendous social stigma toward the disease.  Religious and cultural restrictions prevent open discussions and information campaigns.  Furthermore, he claimed that the government occasionally engages in public disinformation, claiming success and declining prevalence rates which contradict evidence and hinder prevention and treatment efforts.  The government does the minimum to absolve itself of responsibility and is not making inroads, according to several Iranian health workers.  End summary.  Government lacks leadership on HIV/AIDS  ---------------------------------------  2.(S) According to an Iranian epidemiologist, Iran's leadership made no observance of World AIDS Day on December 1, 2007, and there were no AIDS awareness messages on public television. (Note: According to UNICEF`s website, there was an art exhibit at a major Tehran park to raise awareness on World AIDS Day in December 2007.  This program was supported by UNICEF Iran and organized by a major Iranian non-governmental organization as well as other NGOs, UNAIDS, the UN office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the Tehran municipality, and the country's Disease Control office. Endnote.)  The epidemiologist, who was in Dubai applying for a visa to attend an HIV/AIDS workshop at a California university, told IRPoff that although Iran's AIDS response has improved in the past six years, public outreach and awareness is sorely lacking.  3.(S) According to the epidemiologist and his wife, a midwife in Tehran, treatment for HIV/AIDS has not yet acquired broad social support in Iran, and advocacy comes mainly from the medical community.  He said that Tehran University's Center for AIDS research and Iran's Disease Management Center held a joint conference for medical scientists around AIDS Day.  However, most publications and articles regarding HIV/AIDS are limited to the scientific community and do not address the general public. The only public campaign poster the doctor recalled seeing was a large poster in Tehran's Mehrabad airport.  He mentioned another smaller ad from about three years ago which he said cautioned physicians about treating HIV-positive patients; he said this ad was quickly removed, leading him to believe it was released without approval.    4.(S) In Iran, most health-related messages come from the minister of health, but the epidemiologist believed that because the current minister of health and his deputy both happen to be gastrointestinal physicians, they are less interested in HIV/AIDS.  According to an Iranian psychiatrist who operates a small private drug addiction clinic, the government disregards the country's HIV/AIDS problem and denies the drug problem that is helping the spread of the disease.  She said the government does the minimum to absolve itself of responsibility.  Several other Iranian health workers also felt that the government was making little progress fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. According to a recently retired Iranian military nurse and a young orthopedic surgeon, former President Khatami was the only Iranian leader to ever publicly acknowledge that HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Iran.  They indicated there is no mandatory AIDS testing in the military, and testing at marriage is only recommended.  According to a psychiatrist with a drug addiction clinic, the government promotes the idea of voluntary HIV testing and counseling for specific groups such as pregnant women.  According to the epidemiologist and his wife, hospitals do not test patients for HIV prior to medical operations; doctors can perform consensual HIV testing if suspicious of a patient's status for protection of medical personnel.  5.(S) In contrast, the epidemiologist praised the directors of  RPO DUBAI 00000005  002.2 OF 003   Iran's Disease Management Center and Tehran University's AIDS Research Center whose efforts and dedication, he said, have improved the country's HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.  AIDS stigma remains  -------------------  6.(S) According to the epidemiologist, Iran's leaders do not address the country's HIV/AIDS problem in public to avoid addressing the culturally taboo topics of intravenous drug use (IDU) and sexual transmission that are largely responsible for the spread of the disease in Iran.  Separately, a doctor from a charity hospital in southern Tehran said there is a strong social stigma in Iran associated with HIV, even among the medical community who sometimes turn away HIV-positive patients.  Although he maintained the government is starting to address the AIDS issue, he agreed with the first source's assessment that cultural limitations are negatively impacting efforts to educate the public.  He said that because of religious restrictions, officials do not discuss the disease's details and methods of transmission.  Even public service campaigns are vague, for example he described one ad with an image of a woman with the AIDS red ribbon symbol, with the message "I am aware" without naming the disease.  According to the retired military nurse and the orthopedic surgeon, Both sources maintained that the current government denies and downplays the problem probably for religious and moral reasons.  7.(S) Iranian officials still deny and sometimes misinform the public about HIV/AIDS, according to the epidemiologist.  He said that in a December 2007 speech, Health Minister Lankarani claimed that the number of AIDS cases in Iran is declining due to the country's free AIDS treatment program.  The doctor said this claim contradicts evidence of rising prevalence reported by the UN and other sources.  Antiretrovial drug therapy  --------------------------  8.(S) The Iranian government provides AIDS antiretroviral drug therapy for free, but only to a very small number of people. According to the AIDS researcher, centers for behavioral diseases run by the ministry of health provide antiretroviral therapy, and most of the government's AIDS budget goes towards treatment, as it costs 300 thousand Tomans or about 300 dollars to treat one patient.  The researcher claimed that there are only about 200 patients under treatment, and the government has supplies for a total of 300 patients.  She said they use generic drugs, mainly Nelfinavir from Pfizer, which prevents HIV-infected cells from reproducing, but drug resistance is growing and there are not many drug options.  She said that about 70 government outreach clinics operate in Iran.  Iran's new AIDS drug  --------------------  9.(S) In September 2006, Iran's president announced that Iranian scientists at Tehran University had come up with a new drug that boosts the immune system to better fight the AIDS virus.  Two doctors claimed separately to IRPoff that actually Russian scientists developed the drug and then sold the patent to Iran after the Russian ministry of health rejected their product. According to the two Iranian AIDS experts affiliated with Tehran University, the medicine has passed small and large animal testing and is now on trial on human volunteers.  The same sources explained that the medicine, an immune cell booster, technically referred to as a CD4 booster, is called IMOD and is a natural selenium-based drug.  The AIDS expert said Iran's Fars-Russ company performed animal testing in Iran.  She explained that the drug has a low toxicity level and is being administered to volunteer patients.  She said the best results have been among those with a CD4 count of 340-200, but patients more advanced in their disease and lower CD4 counts also benefited from it.  10.(C) Comment:  As in many countries, HIV/AIDS is a sensitive topic in Iran.  The country's efforts in research and treatment areas are positive but lack frank and honest discussions about intravenous drug use and sexual transmission, the primary methods of infection in Iran.  Furthermore, government  RPO DUBAI 00000005  003.2 OF 003   disinformation about the seriousness of the situation undermines efforts to raise public awareness about the disease.  The theme of this past World AIDS Day was "leadership," a factor which appears to be lacking in Iran. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary.  Iran currently produces 7 million tons of steel annually which is enough to meet 50% of its domestic needs, said an Iranian steel insider 13 February.  There are three main government production facilities and ten large private companies, he said, adding that government facilities have a competitive advantage as they do not pay taxes and their fuel and raw material costs are subsidized.  Until two years ago, said the insider, Iran imported the rest of its steel needs from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan; now he said 70% of Iran's steel imports come from China.  He said that the government has artificially deflated steel prices in the run-up to the elections and that he expects to see price hikes after Nowruz. In general, the insider said, the demand for steel has decreased as the construction boom has slowed due to skyrocketing material and labor costs.  End Summary  Domestic steel production  ------------------------------  2.(C) IRPoff met an Iranian steel insider February 13.  The insider reportedly has a steel import-export business in Dubai and he works as a steel broker in the Tehran bazaar.  He said that Iran currently needs 14 million tons of steel a year; half of which is produced domestically and half of which is imported.  The insider said that there are three main government steel production facilities which convert iron ore to pig iron and on to finished steel.  Reportedly there are ten main private facilities; two of which produce finished steel, while the other eight produce pig iron - which is then turned to steel in other smaller facilities, he said.  3.(C) The insider said that subsidized government factories pay below cost prices for raw iron ore and fuel.  He also said that the government companies do not have to pay tax, while the private facilities do.  The steel trader said that all ten of the private facilities were started under the former Khatami administration when start-up industrial factories were granted business loans with 4% interest.  Now, said the insider, it is virtually impossible to start a new factory - unless you have insider connections - as loan interest rates run at about 24%.  4.(C) When asked about privatization plans of the three government facilities, the steel insider said the Mobarakeh Steel Company in Esfahan just floated 5% of its shares on the Tehran Stock Exchange the morning of February 13.  The shares are worth a total of roughly $500 million said the trader. While the insider would like to purchase the shares, it is impossible for him to do so, he said.  The trader claimed that private sector investors lacking strong links to key government officials remain reluctant to invest large sums in public transactions.  According to the insider, such a display would invite unwanted attention to the sources and the use of their wealth.  "Once you start spending hundreds of millions of dollars, people notice...Wealthy Iranians without appropriate government connections invest overseas as it is just easier," he claimed.  Steel imports  --------------  5.(C) Iran imports 7 million tons of steel annually, or half of its steel needs, said the steel trader.  Until 2006, Iran imported steel from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, he said. Now, claimed the trader, 70% of Iran's steel imports come from China; with Russia and the Ukraine accounting for the other 30%.  "Under pressure from the US," bemoaned the trader, "China's prices have doubled in the last two years."  6.(C) The trader said that while there are most likely close to 500 Iranians who have licenses to import steel, there are only 20 main players.  One individual named Sinaiyan (NFI) controls 20% of the import trade, claimed the trader, adding that according to rumors, Sinaiyan does not pay customs duties.  The trader does not know who Sinaiyan is connected to, but surmised it has to be "someone important."  Prices  -------   RPO DUBAI 00000006  002.2 OF 002   7.(C) Government production facilities are forced to sell their steel at a predetermined price, claimed the trader.  While domestic producers are not obligated to sell steel at the same government price, they usually can not charge much more as it is all traded together on the Tehran Stock Exchange, said the insider.  The trader said that in the run-up to the March parliamentary elections, government authorities are keeping the price of steel artificially low; he expects to see a major spike in the cost after the Iranian New Year.  8.(C) While steel needs are holding steady, said the insider, demand has not grown as the construction boom has slowed.  The insider said that while there is a great demand for residential dwellings, not everyone can afford to buy due to increased labor and raw material costs.  The insider claimed that up until last year, construction companies could hire "good" Afghan workers for about $2 a day.  Now, he said, the government has sent all the illegal Afghans home, which has pushed labor costs up for the remaining Afghans to about $20 a day.  9.(C) Comment.  IRPoff met the steel insider for the first time, upon the recommendation of a long-time contact.  The steel trader splits his time evenly between Iran and Dubai and said he would be happy to answer any specific questions IRPO has on the steel business.  10.(C) Comment continued.  This account demonstrates that challenges facing private sector investors in Iran appear almost insurmountable at times. Not only are the odds stacked against them in the predominantly government controlled economy, it is a virtual necessity to bring in a government partner for access to investment opportunities -- further concentrating economic power in the hands of a privileged few.

Yazdi expressed his view that US policy on Iran is flawed and unclear, arguing, that economic sanctions against Iran harm the people, but will do nothing to change the Iranian government's behavior.  Rather than imposing economic sanctions on Iran, the US should encourage trade and economic development in Iran, Yazdi said. Although he thought the Iranian government should accept the P5+1 offer and cease uranium enrichment, he believed that some parts of that plan were flawed as well.  Yazdi also criticized VOA programming, saying that in his view the programming is not only anti-Iran, but also anti-Islam.  On the future of Iranian politics, Yazdi dismissed the likelihood of gradual reform in Iran; he believed the current system would eventually implode due to inherent systemic flaws.  Yazdi's views on the upcoming Majles elections will be reported septel.  End summary.  Yazdi on US policy  ------------------------  2. (S//NF) Yazdi expressed his view in a Feb 20 meeting with IRPoff that US policy on Iran is flawed and unclear.  "Iranians don't know what the US wants," he said, implying whether regime change is a US goal or not.  Although he said that his political party, the banned Freedom Party, had expressed support for the P5+1 offer in exchange for suspension of enrichment and reprocessing and thought the Iranian government should accept it, he said that some parts of the plan were flawed.  Giving an example of what he viewed as a flaw in the P5+1 offer, Dr. Yazdi said the US should support rather than oppose plans for pipelines from central Asia through Iran, and between Iran, Pakistan, and India, because it has the potential to benefit the entire region.  Yazdi also opposed economic sanctions against Iran, arguing that they negatively impact the Iranian people, but will do nothing to change the behavior of the Iranian government.  Rather than imposing economic sanctions on Iran, the US should encourage trade and economic development in Iran, he said.  Economic liberalization, he argued, would be more likely to foster political reform than economic sanctions.  VOA  -------  3. (S//NF) On Voice of America's Persian language programming, Yazdi expressed his view that reporting often lacks credibility and is too harsh-not just against Iran, but against Islam also. He repeatedly called the programming "anti-Islam." Asked about specific programs, statements, or presenters he found offensive, Dr. Yazdi demurred, but was still emphatic about his assessment of VOA.  VOA is run by monarchists, Yazdi said, who have a clear agenda of regime change, but also do not have any idea what conditions in Iran are like and are out of touch with the Iranian public.  The Iranian revolution and the future of Iranian politics  --------------------------------------------- -------------- --------  4.(S//NF) Yazdi compared the Iranian revolution to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, saying both had created governments that were systemically flawed and not sustainable.  He predicted that the current system of government in Iran would crumble due to internal weaknesses, not external intervention.  He repeated comments he made in a February 16, 2008 interview with the New York Times, saying that democracy cannot be imported, that it must emerge indigenously.  Yazdi dismissed the likelihood of gradual reform in Iran, reiterating his view that the current system would eventually implode.  What differentiated the Iranian revolution from the Russian revolution, he added, was that the communist revolution was based on an ideology that was discarded after the system fell.  Iran's revolution, he  RPO DUBAI 00000007  002.2 OF 002   insisted, was based on Islam, which will survive the fall of the Islamic Republic.  Bio background  -------------------  5. (U) Yazdi is a US-educated medical doctor who served as the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic in 1979, during the interim government of Mehdi Bazargan.  He resigned along with the rest of the interim cabinet following the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979.  He was one of the founding members and is currently the head of the Freedom Movement of Iran, which is banned by the Iranian government from participation in politics.  Yazdi registered as a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, but was disqualified by the Guardian Council.  6.(S//NF) IRPO met Yazdi on February 20 to deliver his US non-immigrant visa, our second meeting with Yazdi (reftel). Yazdi, who is 76 and a former legal permanent resident, is currently in the US for medical treatment and to visit his Amcit children.  He said he has received several speaking invitations from US universities (Stanford, Columbia, and Ohio universities were some he named) but has not yet decided whether he will accept any of them.  Yazdi reported having difficulty with UAE authorities upon arrival.  Security officials at the Dubai airport held his passport upon arrival and asked him to return the following day for questioning.  However, he said his passport was returned to him the next day without extensive questioning.  Yazdi said that the UAE immigration officials were apologetic on the second day and said they only wanted his opinion about the current state of Iranian politics.  7. (S//NF) Comment:  While Yazdi is not an influential player in today's political scene in Iran and clearly had no chance of being allowed to run for president in 2005, his views of the situation in Iran are worth reporting.  He was there at the birth of the Islamic Republic and knows the system from the inside out.  His views of US policy may be colored by difficulties he has had in recent years over visa-related issues, but his belief that US trade with Iran will have more impact on Iranian political culture than sanctions is shared by many Iranians.  Many of the Iranians who share this view are from the business sector, who of course have a vested interest in seeing sanctions lifted.  End comment. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)     1.(S) Summary: The results of the 2008 Majles elections in Iran will have little to no immediate bearing on Iranian foreign or nuclear policy, on which the Majles has little impact, but may foreshadow the likely result of the 2009 presidential election. Numerous contacts report that the Iranian public appears to have scant interest in the Majles elections and expects to see little change.  Although the Majles does have some institutional powers, these powers are largely limited to domestic policy. That said, the elections are a valuable barometer in the shaping of political alliances and pre-positioning for the 2009 presidential elections, as well as a glimpse inside current power relationships.  Furthermore, cabinet members often are chosen from among the parliamentary leadership.  The reformers are unlikely to gain many seats, but the triumvirate of Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, and Mehdi Karrubi appears to yield political influence.  End summary.  2.(C) The March 14 Iranian Majles elections will not likely result in any significant immediate changes in the country's foreign or nuclear policy, as the Majles has limited impact on those areas.  In addition, numerous contacts have told IRPO that the Iranian public appears to have scant interest in the Majles elections and expects to see little change.  (Comment: This reportedly scant interest among the Iranian public in the elections does not necessarily translate into a low voter turnout.  The Islamic Republic has had voter participation numbers of 50-60% in most elections, and the Iranian government strongly encourages high turnouts, since it views voter participation as a reflection of systemic legitimacy.  End comment.)  3.(S//NF) Oppositionist Ebrahim Yazdi (please protect), leader of the banned political party Freedom Party and former Islamic Republic of Iran Foreign Minister, told IRPO Febraury 20 that he attaches little importance to the Majles elections.  Despite the reinstatement of several hundred previously disqualified reformist candidates, he did not expect there would be competitive elections in most districts.  Yazdi added that although his Freedom Party registered some candidates for the elections, they were disqualified, as expected for a banned political party.  (Yazdi's views on US policy and Iran's political future are reported septel.)  Political alliances  ----------------------  4.(C) The significance of these elections and all the politicking preceding them is largely in the shaping of political alliances.  Although the Majles has institutional powers, these powers are largely limited to domestic policy. The reformist-centrist triumvirate formed by former president Khatami, Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani, and former Majles speaker Karrubi has some influence, largely derived from the personal influence of the three leaders.  However, despite strenuous lobbying efforts by reformists and Rafsanjani for reversal of disqualifications, the reformists will not be able to field candidates in all constituencies.  Politically speaking, the reformist-centrist triumvirate is out-flanked by a conservative-pragmatist triumvirate of former National Security Council secretary Larijani, Tehran mayor Qalibaf, and former IRGC commander Rezaie.  The latter grouping is providing an alternative to the more hardline conservatives associated with President Ahmadinejad.  A coalition called the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP, sometimes translated as the Comprehensive Coalition of Principle-ists) has been formed by Larijani, Rezaie, and Qalibaf, reportedly as a result of disagreements with the existing United Front of Principle-ists (UFP) which includes several conservative groups that are largely pro-Ahmadinejad.  There are also a few other smaller conservative groups, such as the Independent Principle-ists led by MP Ahmad Tavakkoli, and the Progressive Principle-ist Front led by former intelligence minister Ali Fallahian that remain separate from the UFP and BPCP.  RPO DUBAI 00000008  002.2 OF 003    Vetting  ---------  5. (S//NF) Candidates were first examined by Executive Councils run by the Interior Ministry and subsequently by Supervisory Councils, which answer to the Guardian Council (GC).  Then, the Guardian Council itself examined the candidacies.  A majority of reformist candidates were initially disqualified, many for having "legal records," although it was reportedly not made clear to candidates what this meant.  Some were also disqualified because their adherence to Islam was in question.  6. (S//NF) Khatami, Rafsanjani, and Karrubi found some unusual allies in lobbying to overturn the mass vetting of candidates by the Interior Ministry --  several prominent conservatives including Deputy Majles speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar, MP Ahmad Tavakkoli, and Tehran mayor Qalibaf also publicly protested the vetting.  In one widely publicized case, a grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini, Ali Eshragi, was disqualified after officials reportedly questioned neighbors about his personal life, including whether he prays, fasts, or smokes.  Eshragi was later reinstated following significant criticism over his disqualification.  Several incumbent Majles deputies were also disqualified, although most of those candidates were reinstated, including a reformist candidate who had earlier detailed to IRPO his anger in being vetted out.  (Reftel).  7.(U) Following the loud criticism of the disqualifications, hundreds of candidates were reinstated by the Guardian Council and permitted to run.  The Guardian Council spokesman told reporters that of the nearly 7,600 people who registered their candidacies for the elections, over 4,500 have been approved to run.  Reformist officials have given the media varying estimates regarding how many seats they can contest, ranging from 90-120 for the reformist coalition, and about 160 for the reformist National Trust (Karrubi's Etemad-e-Melli) Party, which is not part of the reformist coalition. It is clear, however, that reformists will not be competitive for all of the Majles seats. .  8.(S//NF) Asked why the majority of the vetting of Majles candidates came from the Interior Ministry and not the Guardian Council as in prior elections, a former GC staff member indicated to IRPO that the change was only a cosmetic shift to improve the GC's  public relations; the GC has not ceded any real authority.  According to the source, the GC is trying to shift blame for vetting candidates away from itself, in the eyes of both the Supreme Leader and the Iranian public.  In the 2005 presidential election, the Supreme Leader publicly rebuked the GC for vetting out all but one of the reformists running for the presidency, and the GC eventually reinstated two reformist candidates.  The source explained that there is little difference today between the Interior Ministry and the Guardian Council, unlike under the Khatami administration when the two entities had ideological differences, and in fact, the GC is currently represented in the Interior Ministry Executive Councils.  The contact explained that the 5th Majles (1996-2000) gave the GC the funds to extend its oversight of elections.  The GC has one representative in each Iranian province, who also sits on the Interior Ministry's Executive Council for the province, thereby exercising authority that should be limited to the Guardian Council.  Beyond vetting - interference in elections  --------------------------------------------- -----  9.(S//NF) Contacts expect to see interference on election day from the IRGC and the Basij, although it is not yet known how extensive the meddling may be.  It appears that the general public does not have confidence in the legitimacy of the process.  The Interior Ministry will also be testing new electronic voting technology during the Majles elections, although hand counting will still be done alongside.   (Note: This issue will be explored in more detail septel. End note.)  Looking toward the presidential election  --------------------------------------------- ----   RPO DUBAI 00000008  003.2 OF 003   10.(C) The results of the Majles elections will be a good indication of whether the political trends are turning more toward the pragmatic and traditional conservatives (principle-ists) exemplified by Larijani, Qalibaf, and Rezaie, and away from the hard-liners associated with Ahmadinejad.  In the December 2006 municipal elections, pragmatic conservatives fared best, but it is too early to determine whether those elections were indicative of a trend.  However, if the trend continues in the Majles elections, it could carry through to the 2009 presidential election.  Furthermore, cabinet members often are chosen from among the parliamentary leadership, which means the face of each parliament can shape politics for years to come.  It will also be interesting to see the degree of support the reform candidates get, although it is clear they cannot retake the parliament.  11.(C) The Khatami-Karrubi-Rafsanjani and Larijani-Rezaie-Qalibaf alliances appear to have been created specifically to pool resources and coordinate strategies for the Majles elections. (Note:  Karrubi always stays somewhat independent.  End note.)  Whether they remain in place in the lead up to the 2009 presidential elections remains to be seen. Rumors abound that Khatami is considering running for the presidency again; it appears unlikely that Karrubi will run again, and it is unlikely that Rafsanjani will try to challenge the constitutional age limit of 75.  Many believe he has his sights set on the Supreme Leader position or at least a position on the council he proposes as a substitute.  On the conservative side, Larijani's candidacy for the Majles elections suggests that he does not have an eye toward the presidency in 2009. Some sources indicate that Rezaie doubts he could win an election and therefore will not run.  At this time, it appears that Qalibaf is the strongest potential candidate of the latter group.  12.(C) However, Ahmadinejad apparently retains popularity with his core constituency, the religious poor, and could be re-elected.  One Iranian political science professor predicted -- with regret -- that Ahmadinejad would win re-election, despite the dire straits that his economic policies have brought upon ordinary Iranians.  Iranians, he said, are like people who keep buying lottery tickets, even though they have never won. Maybe this time, they say to themselves.  It is that sentiment that would see Ahmadinejad re-elected, the professor said. In any case, the Supreme Leader's view of Ahmadinejad in 2009 -- as an asset or liability -- will undoubtedly impact the outcome of the elections. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  According to two Iranian doctors, kidney sales in the Islamic Republic of Iran are legal and regulated; others maintain sales of kidneys are not technically legal but widely tolerated.  The practice is overseen by two NGOs, a foundation for kidney patients and a foundation for special diseases.  The kidney providers and recipients connect either through these NGOs or link up personally through newspaper or posted-street advertisements, where the provider and recipient reach a deal and then consult a transplant center.  Kidneys typically sell for 2-5 million tomans, approximately $2-5000.  According to the doctors, there is no excessive health risk to the donors -- as long as nothing goes wrong with their remaining kidney.  End summary.  NGOs and transplant centers facilitate kidney sales and transplants  --------------------------------------------- -------------- ---------  2.(C) Based on conversations with two Iranian doctors, an anesthesiologist and a forensic pathologist, kidney sales in Iran are legal and regulated.  The practice is overseen by two NGOs, a foundation for kidney patients and a foundation for special diseases.  According to these doctors, there is no excessive health risk to the donors -- as long as nothing goes wrong with their remaining kidney.  Other doctors have said they did not believe the practice of selling kidneys was technically legal but that the practice was widespread.  3.(C) The anesthesiologist described the process in Iran of selling kidneys as uncomplicated:  some donors and recipients contact the regulating centers that locate a match, organize compatibility tests, and arrange for the operation.  Recipients often offer donors money after the transplant.  Others seeking to sell their kidneys place an ad in a newspaper or other site explaining their physical condition such as sex, age, blood type, health, and lifestyle, providing a telephone number for potential buyers.  If a deal is reached, the two parties consult a transplant center where they get evaluated, followed by the surgery.  Both doctors claimed that the current rate for a kidney varies between 2-5 million tomans, or approximately $2-5000.  4.(C) According to the forensic doctor, transplant doctors in major centers in large cities like Tehran, Esfahan, and Shiraz perform the surgery.  He also said that each center has its own criteria and regulations for accepting transplant candidates; the center in Shiraz only accepts kidney transplants between relatives, but some other centers accept non-related donors and recipients.  5.(C) The doctors had no information on underground trade of kidneys outside Iran.  According to a BBC article from October 31 2006, every year 1400 Iranians sell their kidneys on the international black market for organs, and medical agencies facilitate the trade.  Desperate kidney traders  ------------------------  6.(C) The two doctors acknowledged that financial pressure motivate most of the kidney sellers.  The transplant doctor discussed the bitter realities behind most of these transactions, claiming that many of the sellers are young drug addicts with no hope for the future and others are just desperately poor.  He said he had recently heard a rumored story of a man who sold a kidney to raise money for his daughter's dowry.  Religious concerns  ------------------  7.(C) The forensic pathologist explained that the most common and successful organ transplants in Iran are that of corneas. He said Imam Khomeini approved cornea transplantation and preservation of corneas from human cadavers for use in Iran. The Imam's fatwa also allowed organ donation after death for humanitarian reasons, presumably both for scientific research and transplant. He said that despite Khomeini's fatwa,  there is  RPO DUBAI 00000009  002.2 OF 002   a cultural objection to organ donation after death, mainly for fear of disrespect to the body as well as morality concerns that bodies would be exposed to the opposite sex. The doctor, who described himself as a religious man, said he does not know of anything in the Koran that bans transplant of organs.  He said Islam requires one to save one's body from harm, which could be an argument against organ donation during life.  (Note: Neither doctor questioned the practice of selling organs or addressed the religious view of selling organs.  Endnote)  8.(C) On a related note, the forensic scientist  wished that religious leaders would give a fatwa to reassure people regarding biopsies, as he faces similar morality concerns in his field of work.  He called Khomeini progressive for endorsing the medical use of autopsies and organs for medical studies that would help human beings.  He wished this would go a step farther to encourage organ donations, negating the taboo of autopsies; however, he said, the current leader is no Khomeini and would never do such a thing.  He said currently Iranian medical school import bodies of non-Iranian and non-Moslems, mainly from India, for medical schools.  He said some judges are currently claiming that the body of each Moslem is the property of their families or the property of their town mayor. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S//NF) Summary:  Iran has oversubscribed its natural gas commitments by 20%, given current extraction and transportation capabilities, according to a reliable Iranian energy analyst. He added that Iran and UAE's Dana Gas still have not agreed on a pricing structure for Iranian natural gas (ref A).  Deputy Oil Minister Ali Kordan's lack of experience is reportedly to blame for the bungled renegotiation of the Iran-Turkmenistan gas contract (ref B,C,D).  The resulting gas shortages during the winter months may have cost President Ahmadinejad some support among his base, although the government attempted to shift blame to internal enemies.  The analyst argued that Iran is not seriously contemplating a gas OPEC and that statements to that effect are part of a greater public relations strategy to retain Russian support for Iran's nuclear program while it competes with Gazprom for the European market.  He said Iran's February 2008 deal with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan to receive gas in exchange for Iranian deliveries to the Nakhichevan exclave is simply a gas swap with little net gain for Iran. Iran is seeing a greater advantage in providing power to regional power grids as opposed to exporting its gas resources, claimed the analyst.  It is possible that Iran oversubscribes its gas deals because it knows some deals will die from external pressure (as well as internal mismanagement).  The winter's gas shortage could cost allies of the president votes in this week's parliamentary elections, unless Iranians buy the conspiracy theory spread by the government blaming other factions.  End Summary.  Iran over-commits gas resources  -------------------------------  2.(S//NF) A reliable energy analyst from Tehran claimed in a conversation with IRPoffs March 9 that Iran has oversubscribed its gas domestic and export commitments by 20%, given current extraction and transportation capabilities.  He said this was their finding in a recent study his company did for a European client considering investment in Iran's natural gas industry. The analyst claimed that former Deputy Oil Minister for International Affairs Mohammed Hadi Nejad Hosseinian told him recently that he believed Iran has over committed its gas exports by 1.5 times its actual capabilities.  (Bio note: Hosseinian was also Iran's Ambassador to the UN prior to Javad Zarif.  Endnote)  Although the analyst did not blame oversubscription for some of the protracted gas contract negotiations Iran is involved in, he noted that Iran and UAE's Dana Gas still have not agreed to pricing terms (ref A).  Iran, Turkmenistan gas deal  ----------------------------  3.(S//NF) The analyst also claimed that the shut-off of Turkmen gas exports to Iran since 29 December 2007 is a result of Deputy (so called Acting) Oil Minister Ali Kordan's lack of energy experience and inept negotiation strategies (ref B,C,D).  Kordan reportedly got his current position because of his close ties to the president, not his qualifications.  The analyst said that just prior to the expiration of the previous Iran-Turkmenistan gas contract, Iran sent Kordan to Ashgabat to work out the terms of a new deal.  When Turkmenistan asked Iran to match a much higher price offer from Russia, Kordan reportedly insisted on a price far below market value.  Turkmenistan declined the offer. (Bio Note:  Ali Kordan was appointed Deputy Oil Minister in October 2007.  His previous positions include:  Deputy Labor Minister, President of Iran's Technical and Vocational Organization, Deputy Head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) Provincial and Parliamentary Affairs, Deputy Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister for Administrative and Financial Affairs.  Endnote)  4.(S//NF) The resulting gas shortages in harsh winter weather negatively impacted President Ahmadinejad's popularity among the lower class, traditionally his base of support, according to the analyst.  The source said this was the most direct impact of government mismanagement that people in remote provinces had felt.  He added that Iranian government spokesman Elham had  RPO DUBAI 00000011  002.2 OF 003   publicly blamed domestic Iranian politics for the breakdown of negotiations.  According to a Tehran reformist daily, Aftab-e Yazd, Elham said February 6, "Some currents within the country have formed a financial partnership with Turkmenistan and, in order to achieve their political and personal interests, they have tried to put the people under pressure by cutting Turkmenistan's gas supply in the recent period of unprecedented cold weather.  The Intelligence Ministry is currently looking into this matter."  The analyst felt Elham's remarks were a veiled attempt to accuse Assembly of Experts head Rafsanjani of secretly maneuvering to kill the deal to embarrass the  SIPDIS president.  5.(U) Despite the fact that Turkmenistan has yet to resume gas exports to Iran, a March 8 article from the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) reported that Turkmenistan plans to expand its oil, gas and petrochemical industries through a contract with Iran.  According to ISNA, Turkmen President Berdimuhamedov asked his country's oil and gas industry to sign a $29 million contract with Iran's Pars Energy Company, allowing Pars to develop Turkmenistan's oil and gas industry.  Iran, Russia gas relations  --------------------------  6.(S//NF) When asked how Iran is managing its relationship with Russia, given the fact that on one hand it is looking for Russian backing to its nuclear program and on the other, it is trying to break Gazprom's stronghold over the European market, the analyst claimed that Iran puts on a show to keep Russia happy.  Specifically, he said, Iran has no interest in forming a gas OPEC with Russia but makes statements of interest to woo the Russians.  The source said that in general, Gazprom-Iranian relations are sensitive.  Russia would like Iran to focus on supplying the eastern market and leave Europe to Gazprom.  In light of this, it is noteworthy that in mid-February 2008, Iranian Oil Minister Nozari announced that Gazprom and Iran decided to jointly develop several phases of Iran's South Pars gas field.  While final agreements have not been signed, the two sides are reportedly in the process of concluding a deal.  The announcement came just one week after Iran had announced, what Russian press termed an "unpleasant surprise for Moscow," its possible participation in the Georgia-Ukraine-EU "White Stream" gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the Caspian via the Ukraine to Poland.  Iran's Foreign Minister Mottaki had also indicated early February 2008 that Iran would potentially join the Nabucco gas project which will transport gas from Turkey to Austria.  Iran, Azerbaijan gas swaps  --------------------------  7.(S//NF)  According to the analyst, Iran's February 2008 deal with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) to receive gas in exchange for Iranian deliveries to the Nakhichevan exclave is simply a gas swap with little net gain for Iran.  Iran sees advantages to synchronizing regional power grids  --------------------------------------------- ------------  8.(S//NF) The analyst maintained that Iran has now concluded that it is more advantageous to export electricity to regional power grids than to try to export natural resources.  Energy Minister Fattah said February 19 that Iran and Russia signed a MoU to synchronize their electric systems, adding that "the port systems of Iran and Russia are technically very similar so that Iran's power grid can benefit its neighbors like Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia."  Additionally, Iran is becoming an important supplier of electricity to bordering areas in Iraq.  9.(S) Comment:  Perhaps because Iran knows that international pressure (as well as internal mismanagement) will end up killing some of its energy deals, it explores more export deals than it could fulfill, with current capacities.  Most likely the Gazprom investment in South Pars will serve a two-fold purpose:  1) appease Russia by allowing it to become involved in Iran's gas production and therefore a background player in Iran's projected cooperation in the Nabucco and White Stream projects; and 2) give Iran's gas sector a technological upgrade, thereby reducing  RPO DUBAI 00000011  003.2 OF 003   oversubscription.  10.(S) Comment continued:  The results of the March 14 parliamentary elections in areas hit hardest by the gas cut-off may indicate whether allies of Ahmadinejad suffered by association.  Elham's clumsy attempt to blame internal machinations for the gas cut-off seems a desperate attempt to shift blame away from the administration.  That said, Iranians tend to put great stock in conspiracy theories. BURNS 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000012  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  LONDON FOR GAYLE, BERLIN FOR PAETZOLD BAKU FOR HAUGEN, ISTANBUL FOR ODLUM  E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/13/2018 TAGS: IR, PGOV, PREL SUBJECT: IRAN: ELECTION EVE OBSERVATIONS  REF: RPO DUBAI 0008  RPO DUBAI 00000012  001.2 OF 004   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns,  Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DoS. REASON: 1.4 (d)   1.(C) Summary: With reformers largely vetted out of the March 14 Iranian Majles elections, the main competition is between hardline conservatives loosely associated with President Ahmadinejad, and the more pragmatic conservatives associated with former National Security Council secretary Larijani, former IRGC commander Rezaie, and Tehran mayor Qalibaf.  The two main conservative coalitions are the United Front of Principle-ists (UFP) which is comprised of ultra-right hardline groups, and the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP), which comprises the more pragmatic traditional conservative groups. Although UFP contains some groups that support Ahmadinejad, it also includes some of his conservative critics, such as Majles speaker Haddad-Adel, Deputy Majles speaker Bahonar, and the head of the Majles Research Center Tavakkoli.  IRPO contacts expect that the pragmatic conservatives will do well at the polls on Friday and expressed mixed views about whether there was a significant difference in the platforms of the two conservative groups.  If the BPCP dominates these elections as expected, they may use the Majles forum to step up their criticism of Ahmadinejad and prepare ground for the 2009 presidential elections, although their ideological platform does not appear to differ greatly from the ultra-right.  That said, some analysts have indicated they could seek better relations with the international community.  End summary.  Reformers-a spent force  -------------------------------  2.(C) Having been heavily vetted out of the Majles elections by the Interior Ministry and Guardian Council and facing allegations of being Western lackeys, Iran's reformers are essentially not competitive in the March 14 Majles elections. The main reformist coalition, which includes two of the largest reformist parties--the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF, also called Mosharekat) and the Mojahideen of the Islamic Revolution (MIRO)--will reportedly only be able to contest 90 of the 290 Majles seats.  Former Majles speaker Mehdi Karrubi's National Trust Party (also called National Confidence Party) announced that it can contest 160 seats.  The three reformist lists for Tehran have several names in common.  The news organ of the National Trust Party, Etemad-e-Melli, reported March 9 that its party shares 15 names in common with the Reformist Coalition list, and 18 names in common with the Popular Reformist Coalition, which is close to the National Trust party and run by Mehdi Karrubi's wife Fatemeh.  3.(C) In the last week before the elections, conservatives have stepped up attacks against reformers.  Contact with Western diplomats and claims of expressions of support from the US administration have exposed Iran's reformers to accusations of disloyalty.  Hardline daily Keyhan attacked former deputy Majles speaker Mohammad Reza Khatami this week for meeting with the German ambassador to Tehran.  According to AFP, Keyhan printed a purported partial transcript of the conversation in which Khatami expressed concerns about the Iranian nuclear program and the Majles elections.  Foreign ministry spokesman Hosseini accused the US administration this week of trying to undermine Iranian national unity through statements of support for "certain political movements" (i.e. reformers).  Intelligence Minister Ejei accused reformist MP Noureddin Pirmoazzen of treason for a March 9 interview on Voice of America in which the MP  criticized the disqualifications of reformist candidates from the elections.  (Comment: These high-profile attacks against reformers on the eve of the elections may be intended to paper over the appearance of conservative disunity caused by pre-election infighting.  They may also be designed to woo undecided voters to the conservative side by portraying reformers as traitors to the nation. End comment.)  4.(S) In any case, reformers in their current form are viewed by some as a spent force in Iran.  One analyst said the reformers were too focused on appearing the victim to be able to project an image of strength.  He criticized reformers for not reaching out to the lower-middle class, even as many in the provinces had become disenchanted with the president for not living up to promises made on his visits.  The source said that in some cases, Ahmadinejad's promises were left unfulfilled, in others the results were mismanaged.   This analyst had written off the  RPO DUBAI 00000012  002.2 OF 004   reformist IIIPF (Mosharekat) but thought the National Trust Party may fare better.   He noted that some reformist candidates chose voluntarily to opt out of elections.  Conservatives-internecine squabbling  --------------------------------------------- --  5. (S) Internal squabbling prevented the conservatives-who increasingly refer to themselves as principle-ists-from unifying on a single electoral list.  The two main conservative coalitions are the United Front of Principle-ists (UFP, also called United Fundamentalist Front) which is comprised of ultra-right groups, and the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP, also called Comprehensive Coalition of Principle-ists), which comprises the more pragmatic traditional conservative groups.  A third coalition called the Progressive Principle-ist Front was created by former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, according to domestic press reports.  Fallahian was reportedly first allied with the UFP, but broke with them in mid-February after UFP reportedly declined to include him on their electoral list.   The Tehran-based analyst predicted that an increasing number of former intelligence officials were likely to enter politics.  6. (S) The UFP has been associated in the press with President Ahmadinejad, and although it does contain some groups that support him, it also includes some of his conservative critics, such as Majles speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel, Majles Research Center head Ahmad Tavakkoli, Deputy Majles speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar, and MP Elias Naderan.  (Note: Tavakkoli's public criticism of the UFP list was mistakenly reported in RPO Dubai 0008 as his separation from the UFP list. Endnote.)  The BPCP is associated with former National Security Council secretary Larijani, former IRGC commander Rezaie, and Tehran mayor Qalibaf, who represent the more technocratic and pragmatic conservatives.  Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani, the influential head of the conservative Militant Clergy Association, failed in his attempts to unify the conservatives and ultimately supported the UFP.  One Tehran-based analyst told IRPOffs that it was significant that such an influential regime figure as Mahdavi-Kani was unable to unify the conservative groups. He implied that although divisions are deeper than they appear, the divisions were not for the most part policy differences.  When asked why Bahonar would join the UFP list, given his clear differences with the president, the analyst said that longstanding social ties in Iranian society often trump ideological differences.  A Western diplomat posted in Tehran also assessed that these divisions among conservatives are due largely to personality differences and disagreements over elections planning than to any ideological or major policy differences among conservatives.  7.(S)  The Tehran-based analyst suggested that Larijani opted to run from Qom in order not to challenge (and potentially embarrass) Haddad-Adel, who leads both conservative lists.  A US-based Iranian political analyst said separately that he thought Larijani ran from Qom only because he felt he would get a stronger electoral mandate there than in Tehran, given that Larijani's father was a Qom-based ayatollah and seminary lecturer.  If both Larijani and Haddad-Adel are elected, it will be noteworthy whether Larijani will try to challenge Haddad Adel for the position of Majles speaker.  Both analysts thought that it was likely that Haddad-Adel would run for president in 2009, and Larijani would then succeed him as Majles speaker.  8.(S) The economy is the biggest campaign issue for candidates from all political groups, with official statistics putting inflation at over 20%.  Many conservatives are attempting to distance themselves from President Ahmadinejad and his failed economic policies by criticizing the government's economic performance, and calling for different economic policies.  The US-based analyst said that the competition for seats in the provinces and rural areas is focused more on local issues than national political trends, but that in the large cities-particularly Tehran-the competition is almost entirely about national-level politics, especially the economy.  Electoral procedures and campaigning  --------------------------------------------- -  9.(U) The electoral procedures for the Iranian Majles elections contain some elements of proportional representation, but  RPO DUBAI 00000012  003.2 OF 004   Iranians ultimately will cast their votes for individual candidates, although they can opt to select a list in its entirety.  The electoral lists that have been compiled by the various political groupings are, in essence, voting guides.  For example, Iran's most important electoral constituency, Tehran, has 30 seats in the Majles.  On election day, each Tehran resident chooses 30 candidates from among the reported 827 candidates who are running in Tehran.   Once the results are tallied, the seats go to the 30 candidates who received the most votes.  Interior Minister Purmohammadi said March 13 that the Interior Ministry hopes to have final elections results before the Iranian new year (Nowruz) on March 21.  According to Iranian press, if a second round of polling is required, those elections may not take place until late April or early May.  10.(U) These elections will see the introduction of some computerized counting.  Deputy Interior Minister Mousapour told Iranian press that there will be electronic vote counting alongside hand counting, in order to test the electronic vote counting technology.  Reportedly, voters can choose to vote with either a paper or an electronic ballot.  11.(S) Of the 290 seats in the Majles, five are set aside for representatives of Iran's recognized religious minorities: two seats for Armenian Christians, and one seat each for Assyrian Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians.  Polling is reportedly held in community centers or places of worship of the respective communities.  There has been little press coverage of those races.  The US-based Iranian analyst asserted that the choice of representatives for these communities is generally decided among the respective communities before the elections, and the vote is essentially a formality.  12.(U) Apart from limiting official campaign time to the week prior to the elections, the government has introduced additional restrictions, including banning the placement of photos or posters in public places.  Photos are reportedly only permitted in fliers that are handed out during election week.  There were also rumors that the Internet would be blocked on election day, which Interior Minister Purmohammadi denied, although a reformist press website Norooz reported on March 11 that Yahoo email and chat services were blocked by several internet service providers.  13.(S) IRPO contacts report that public interest in the elections is minimal.  One Iranian reform-minded political science professor said the timing of the elections-one week before Iran's biggest holiday, Nowruz-has contributed to this. People are too busy shopping, cleaning their homes, and visiting relatives to pay much attention to the elections, he said.  He said he was so disenchanted with the election that for the first time, he would not vote.  Electoral interference?  ---------------------------  14.(S) IRPO contacts seem widely to expect that there will be some degree of electoral interference.  Contacts almost invariably assume there will be a strong presence of Basij forces at polling stations and suggest that other unspecified interference is possible.  The acting commander of the Basij, Hossein Taeb, was quoted in the Iranian press in late February saying that Basij should have a "maximum presence" in the elections.  The Supreme Leader's representative to the Basij also said in press articles that the Basij should play an important role in "preparing the ground for the maximum participation of the people."  When asked why IRGC Commander Jafari would have openly called for support for principle-ist candidates, one analyst suggested that Iranians in the public sphere have a hard time remembering that their remarks reach other audiences than the one in front of them.  15.(S) When asked how authorities may try to manipulate votes in this election, the Tehran-based political analyst asserted that there was low likelihood of overt technical interference in the elections, but that local Basij leaders, clerics, and other opinion leaders would exert influence in support of various conservative candidates.  (Comment:  Given that both conservative groups have factional support from the IRGC, it is not clear which group would benefit most from IRGC/Basij meddling.  End comment)  The US-based Iranian analyst said that Majles candidates in the provinces often receive funds for unofficial campaigning (e.g. hosting dinners for religious  RPO DUBAI 00000012  004.2 OF 004   ceremonies, helping the destitute, paying people's debts, etc.) from organizations in Tehran, such as the bonyads, the IRGC, and others with which they might be affiliated.  He noted the dominance of economic discourse in the campaigns, citing an article this week in the conservative Jomhuri-ye-Eslami newspaper which criticized candidates for not talking about Islam enough.  According to the article, there are very few clerics running in these Majles elections compared to previous rounds and that even the list of one of the best known clerical organizations in Iran (not named) has only about 6% clerics on the list.  The article predicts a downward trend of clerical participation in the future.  16.(S) Comment:  Iranian elections often yield surprising results; however, if the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists dominate the election as many observers have predicted, they may use the forum of the Majles to step up their criticism of President Ahmadinejad and lay the groundwork for a Qalibaf presidency.  As laid out in reftel, electoral dominance by this group is unlikely to result in major immediate shifts in Iranian policy.  However, their presence in the Majles-and willingness to criticize the president--could act as a counterweight to the ultra-rightists in the current administration.  The Tehran-based analyst predicted that pragmatic conservatives would take control of the Majles this year and the presidency next year.  He said that judging by Qalibaf's positive and technocratic leadership of the Tehran municipality, this analyst reasoned that a Qalibaf presidency could eventually produce more pragmatic shifts in policy and increased outreach to the West and the international community. That said, one Western diplomat posted in Tehran asserted that the pragmatic conservatives are vulnerable to accusations of not being sufficiently revolutionary, and may feel obliged to adjust their statements accordingly.  In any case, ultimate policy decisions will remain in the hands of the Supreme Leader. BURNS

Iran's interior ministry announced that turnout in the March 14 Majles elections was close to 65%, higher than four years ago. Iranian state-run Press TV reported that 49% of the count has been completed and that conservatives have so far won 77% (108 seats) of the 141 seats that have been counted - without differentiating between pro-Ahmadinejad conservatives, and the president's conservative critics.  A spokesman of the United Front of Principle-ists, which has been associated in the press with Ahmadinejad, but also includes some of his conservative critics, told state-run news outlet IRNA that 70% of the newly elected legislators are on the UFP list.  Press TV reported that so far reformists have won 33 seats (23%), and an unknown number of independents have also won seats.  AP is reporting that 115 of the 290 seats have been decided so far.  Of those 115, AP reports that pro-Ahmadinejad conservatives have won 42 seats (36%), his conservative critics have 28 seats (24%), reformists have 16 seats (14%), and independents have 29 seats (25%).  2.(SBU) Summary continued: Analysis in Iranian press noted that because the votes in the provinces center more around local issues than national politics, only the results of the big cities, especially the 30 seats in the capital Tehran, will clarify political trends in parliament.  In the only reported result so far of the concurrently-held by-elections for the Assembly of Experts, Hashem Hashemzadeh-Harisi was re-elected in the East Azerbaijan constituency.  Reformist groups have already suggested there were some "electoral irregularities" and a reformist website charged that Basij forces at polling stations were intimidating voters, but no reports have been seen so far of any violence.  Analysts see the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as the big winners in these elections.  While there are reportedly several political factions within the IRGC, the group as a whole is seen as Iran's most dedicated supporters of the revolution and the Supreme Leader.  End summary.  Government reports high turnout ---------------------------------------  3.(U) "Around 65 percent of the electorate took part in the elections, which is more than the last election," said Habibollah Hassan Khanlou, the secretary of the interior ministry's election office.  The 2004 Majles elections saw a turnout of 51%.  Nearly 44 million Iranians were eligible to vote in these elections.  (Note: Iran's voting age was raised last year from 15 to 18. Endnote.)  Voter participation is important to the government of Iran because they declare high turnout to be an indication of the legitimacy of the Islamic Republican system.  Interior Minister Purmohammadi even directly connected a high voter turnout with public support for the government's nuclear policy, saying that the "massive turnout" at the polls was Iran's response to the newest UNSC resolution against Iran.  4.(SBU) Numerous senior government officials made statements in the days before the election encouraging the public to vote to thwart the plans of Iran's "enemies."  Although the reform candidates were heavily vetted out of the competition, reform leaders such as former president Khatami and former Majles speaker Karrubi nonetheless encouraged reformers and their supporters to turn out at the polls.  A limited number of foreign press outlets were allowed to cover the Majles elections from inside the country, although it was not clear whether their access was limited to Tehran.  International press outlets reported apparently low voter turnout early on election day, and some reported that turnout increased later in the day.  Polls in Iran were kept open an additional five hours, closing at 11 pm local time.  At the out-of-country polling station in the Iranian consulate in Dubai, there were no crowds visible during the day, although the consulate may not have been the only polling station in Dubai.  Partial results in, but not for Tehran -------------------------------------------  5.(U) Partial results from some of Iran's 30 provinces have already been received, although no results for the crucial Tehran constituency have been reported yet.  Interior Minister Purmohammadi initially said that the final nationwide results would be reported by March 20 at the latest but was subsequently quoted in different sources saying that results would be  RPO DUBAI 00000013  002.2 OF 003   released within 3-4 days or conversely, within 24 hours. Authorities announced March 15 that runoff elections would be necessary in 17 constituencies, without noting when the runoffs would take place.  6. (U) Iranian state-run press reported March 15 that 49% of the count has been completed and that conservatives have so far won 77% of the 141 (out of a total 290) seats that have been counted.  These reports do not differentiate between pro-Ahmadinejad conservatives, and the president's conservative critics, the so-called United Front of Principle-ists (UFP) and Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP) respectively .  According to state-run English-language news outlet Press TV, 141 seats have already been decided, and conservatives gained 108 of those seats (77%), without differentiating between the different principle-ist factions. Reformists won 33 seats so far (23%), and an unknown number of independents won seats, according to Press TV.  7. (SBU) The most recent AP story reported that 115 seats had been decided so far, and of those 115,  pro-Ahmadinejad conservatives won 42 seats (36%), his conservative critics have 28 seats (24%), reformists have 16 seats (14%), and independents have 29 seats (25%).  (Comment:  If this trend continues of such a sizeable independent representation, the political leanings of this independent group could have an important impact on the Majles.  End comment)  According to state-run news outlet Al Alam, some politicians said their informal exit polls suggested the UFP, the most pro-government group of candidates, was doing well in Tehran, where conservatives hold 26 of the capital's seats in the outgoing assembly. UFP secretary Shahabeddin Sadr told state-run news outlet IRNA March 15, "The names announced by the Interior Ministry show that 70 percent of the newly elected legislators are on our list of candidates."  A BPCP leader, Ali Larijani, reportedly won more that 75% of the vote for the seat he was contesting in Qom, according to Fars News. Fars News commented that considering his landslide, it remains to be seen whether Larijani would replace as new parliament speaker Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, head of the conservative faction who ran for Tehran where results have yet to be announced. According to Iranian press, another conservative critic of Ahmadinejad, Majles National Security and Foreign Policy commission head Alaeddin Boroujerdi, was re-elected.  Analysis in Iranian press noted that because the votes in the provinces center more around local issues than national politics, only the results of the big cities, especially the 30 seats in the capital Tehran, will clarify political trends in parliament.  8.(U) In comments on the eve of the elections, Supreme Leader Khamenei was seen as encouraging people to vote for conservatives (also called principle-ists), although it was not clear from his comments whether he was referring to pro-Ahmadinejad candidates or conservatives writ-large. Khamenei enjoined the Iranian public to vote for "suitable people, who support people's rights and who are committed and devoted to Islamic foundations and values."  Reformists make some allegations of "electoral irregularities" --------------------------------------------- ----------------- 9. (U) Police and Basij forces were reportedly present at polling stations, with young government supporters reportedly urging the public to vote for conservatives, according to AP. According to AFP, the leader of one of the two main reformist camps, National Trust Party head Mehdi Karrubi told reporters at the Interior Ministry, "There are concerns regarding some irregularities by willful people to do something with the ballot boxes."  Reformist former interior minister Abdolvahed Musavi-Lari reportedly sent a letter to Guardian Council head Ayatollah Jannati complaining of electoral irregularities and alleged fraud, according to western news outlet ADNKronos.   A reformist electoral site, Baharestan, reportedly alleged that Basij forces were intimidating voters in areas south of Tehran. According to Resalat newspaper, Guardian Council head Ayatollah Jannati said there would be no fraud in vote-counting but there have been no specific reports of government response to the claims of interference in polling.  Reformers reportedly denounced a decision by the Interior Ministry to announce the election results only after the vote tally was final.  Results had always been announced as they were tallied in the past while counting continued.  "We are hearing various reports of irregularities in favor of the government," said Abdullah Nasseri, a spokesman for reformers, adding that the decision to announce the results after the final count created further concerns.  However, according to Press TV, Hossein Mar'ashi, the head of a reformist coalition electoral headquarters told Fars,  RPO DUBAI 00000013  003.2 OF 003   "We are sure that the election was free and fair.  We also reject US and British news agencies' claim that the reformists have plan to withdraw.  It's a mere lie."  10. (U) ADNKronos reported that two Majles candidates were disqualified minutes before polls opened on Friday morning. Azeri candidate Jafar Fathalizadeh--a cleric--was reportedly accused of spreading "ethnic hatred" and "inciting people to clash with police during the campaign" and charged with "endangering national security" by the special court for the clergy.  In addition, reformist Mohammad Reza Purebrahimi was reportedly prevented from running for a Majles seat in Kerman, western Iran.  No reason was given, although some Kerman residents reportedly speculated that he was disqualified because he was likely to win against his conservative opponent.  Assembly of Experts ------------------------- 11.(SBU) In the only reported result so far of the concurrently-held by-elections for the Assembly of Experts, the body that supervises and selects the Supreme Leader, Hashem Hashemzadeh-Harisi was re-elected in the East Azerbaijan constituency.  Who is the big winner? --------------------------- 12.(SBU)Comment:  Many analysts and observers assert that the big winner in these Majles elections is Supreme Leader Khamenei.  The fissures that clearly emerged within conservative ranks do not hurt the Supreme Leader; in contrast, they lessen the risk of any one group or person amassing enough power and influence to rival him.  Ultimately, whichever conservative group claims dominance in these elections will only be able to exercise power with the approval of the Supreme Leader.  Criticism of the president's policies will likely increase from the 8th Majles, given that even the UPF lists contains critics of Ahmadinejad, such as Deputy Speaker Bahonar.  13.(SBU) Comment continued:  The other clear winner is the IRGC, which has continuously expanded its presence in Iranian politics over the past four years.  While we don't have exact numbers, a significant number of Majles candidates are reportedly former IRGC members or have some affiliation with the IRGC.  14.(SBU) Comment continued:  Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf may emerge a winner, though not a parliamentary candidate, depending on predominance of BPCF candidates.  A leader of that faction,  a former IRGC officer, and current Tehran mayor, Qalibaf is increasingly seen as the conservative figure most likely to present a significant challenge to President Ahmadinejad in next year's presidential elections.  If the BPCF does well and makes a name for itself in the next Majles challenging the president, Qalibaf would be well placed to challenge Ahmadinejad for the presidency in 2009.   It is noteworthy that an Ahmadinejad deputy just reportedly established a news agency to critique the performance of the Tehran municipality, a clear indication that Ahmadinejad sees a threat from Qalibaf has also recently been attempting to raise his international profile.  The mayor paid an official visit to Baghdad the week prior to President Ahmadinejad, in which he pledged the resources of the Tehran municipality toward rebuilding Baghdad.  He also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, meeting with the likes of UK Foreign Secretary Miliband.  On the eve of the parliamentary elections, Qalibaf gave an interview to major British newspaper The Times in which he attempted to portray himself as more open to engagement with the West.  Without referring to Ahmadinejad by name, he said that it was wrong to think that there was a "dominant" desire for confrontation and conflict in Iran, adding: "I would like the West to change its attitude to Iran and trust Iran and rest assured that there's an attitude in Iran to advance issues through dialogue."  15.(SBU) Comment continued:  Reformists are looking to hang on to, and ideally expand, their current 40 seats in the Majles. However, after extensive vetting of reformist candidates, reformers ran in only about half of the races nationwide. Despite the high-profile politicking by Rafsanjani, Khatami, and Karrubi on behalf of the reform movement in Iran, reformist politicians seem unlikely to regain their control over the government any time in the near future.

In Tehran, 14 of the 30 seats have been decided, and all of those seats have gone to conservatives.  However, it is difficult to delineate between pro-Ahmadinejad hardliners and the president's conservative critics.  According to Iranian press, runoff elections will be held in late April for the remaining 16 seats in Tehran, as well as for seats in 17 other constituencies.  Final elections results for the entire Majles will not be available until after the runoffs.  The partial results also indicate that reformers fared better than expected in provinces outside Tehran, however they nonetheless remain a minority in parliament.  Iranian press have reported differing percentages of voter turnout, varying between 60-65%, although an independent calculation of the numbers reported suggest it could be as low as 52%.  In the concurrently-held Assembly of Experts by-elections, the influential senior cleric Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani was elected to one of the Tehran seats on the Assembly.  End summary.  Conservatives dominate Tehran -- based on partial results  --------------------------------------------- --------------  2.(SBU) According to the partial elections results for the important Tehran constituency, conservatives dominated as expected, but it was unclear how many of those conservatives are supporters of President Ahmadinejad.  The two main conservative coalitions each put out electoral lists that served as voting guides for the public (reftel A).  One of the two main groups, the United Front of Principle-ists (UFP), has been associated in the press with President Ahmadinejad, but the UFP list also includes some of his most vocal conservative critics, such as current Majles speaker Haddad-Adel, deputy Majles speaker Bahonar, and Majles Research Center head Tavakkoli, all of whom were re-elected on Friday.  3.(SBU) The other major conservative coalition, the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP), was created by former National Security Council Secretary Larijani, former IRGC commander Rezaie, and Tehran mayor Qalibaf, all of whom ran against Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election. Larijani, Rezaie, and Qalibaf are regarded as more traditional, pragmatic conservatives.  Although their views on nuclear and foreign policy issues do not appear to differ greatly from the established government policies, they have criticized Ahmadinejad at times and indicate a greater willingness to engage with the West and the international community (reftels B, C).  International press coverage of the elections has cast the UFP list as pro-Ahmadinejad, and the BPCP list as his conservative critics, however as noted earlier, the UFP list features some prominent Ahmadinejad critics.  To further muddy the waters, the UFP and BPCP lists for the critical Tehran constituency had nine candidates in common, making it difficult to delineate between pro-Ahmadinejad hardliners and the president's conservative critics.  Reformers gain seats in provinces  ---------------------------------  4.(SBU) Reformers have reportedly fared better than expected, according to the partial results.  Reform groups are now expected to gain some seats in the parliament, slightly increasing their strength, although they remain a minority.  In the previous Majles reformers had 40 seats.  The spokesman of one of the main reformist coalitions was quoted by AFP March 16 saying that reformers were set to gain about 50 seats outside of Tehran, and expected to pick up more seats in the runoff elections for Tehran.  Reformers were ultimately only able to field candidates for around 100 of 290 Majles seats.  Although the ability of reformers to effect change in Iranian policy remains minimal, the fact that they won over 50% of the seats that they were able to compete for -- if reports are accurate -- would seem to indicate that the Iranian public is more supportive of reformers than the government would like to portray.  Runoffs scheduled for late April  --------------------------------  5.(U) According to Iranian press, because only 14 candidates in  RPO DUBAI 00000014  002.2 OF 002   Tehran received the required minimum 25% of the vote, runoff elections will be held in late April for the remaining 16 seats in Tehran, as well as for seats in 17 other constituencies (Note:  It is unclear from press reports how many open seats remain in the other 17 constituencies.  Endnote.)  Final elections results for the entire Majles will not be available until after the runoffs.  Voter turnout estimates differ  ------------------------------  6. (SBU) Iranian press has reported differing percentages of voter turnout, varying between 60-65%, although independent calculation of the numbers reported suggest it could be as low as 52%.  In differing reports in the Iranian press on March 15, Interior Ministry figures of 65% voter turnout were cited, and alternately Interior Minister Purmohammadi said that 60% of eligible voters took part in the elections.  However, the same press report citing the 60% figure also gave the number of votes as approximately 22.8 million, which when calculated represents about 52% of the 44 million eligible voters in Iran.  There was no explanation in the press reports of the discrepancy.  Assembly of Experts by-elections  --------------------------------  7.(U) In the concurrently-held Assembly of Experts by-elections, the influential senior cleric Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani was elected to one of the Tehran seats on the Assembly. See reftel D for discussion of possible long-term significance for the position of the Supreme Leader. BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary: Analysts and observers appear to agree that although conservatives retain control of the Majles, the influence of Ahmadinejad loyalists appears to have weakened, though all sides are claiming victory. As a result, this Majles is more likely to be at odds with the president's administration, particularly on domestic economic issues.  One contact characterized the trend as the rise of technocratic MPs, who are likely to prioritize action over ideology, in the mold of Tehran mayor Qalibaf.  Updated elections results confirm that conservatives have won the majority of the seats in the key Tehran constituency (19 of 30).  The remaining 11 seats will be contested in runoff elections scheduled for late April, along with seats in 41 other constituencies.  According to several contacts, elections for provincial seats are much more about local issues than national politics, with the result that the provincial MPs are more likely to ally with whichever political grouping is most powerful in the Majles, in order to get support for bills and projects that benefit their province.  2.(S) Summary continued: The first order of business for the new Majles when they take office in June will be to vote on Majles leadership positions.  According to one analyst, former Supreme Council for National Security (SCNS) secretary Larijani is unlikely to challenge current Majles speaker Haddad-Adel - who was reelected -  for his position, but will probably become the first deputy speaker, or the chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy commission.  It will be noteworthy whether many prominent critics of the president are voted to leadership positions.  If pragmatic conservatives gain a majority and take the important leadership positions in the Majles, their candidate may be well-placed to win the 2009 presidential elections, though it is far too soon to make predictions.  End summary.  Results update  ---------------  3.(U) According to nation-wide results reported by the Interior Ministry, 70% of votes went to conservatives, 25% to reformers, and 5% to independents.  According to Iranian press, the final counts for the most important race in Tehran are complete and 19 of the 30 seats have been decided.  The remaining 11 seats will be contested in the runoff elections, pitting reformers against principle-ists, or conservatives.  In Tehran's first round, conservatives dominated from the two main conservative coalitions, primarily the United Front of Principle-ists (UFP) which has been associated with President Ahmadinejad but nonetheless includes some of his critics, and to a lesser degree, the Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists (BPCP) which comprises largely pragmatic conservatives who somewhat distanced themselves from the president.  All of the 19 Tehran seats decided in the first round went to conservatives, the majority of whom are on the UFP list, although five were on both the UFP and BPCP lists, and two were solely on the BPCP.  Out of reformist candidates in Tehran, only the reformist list header, Majid Ansari (a former MP and a member of the Expediency Council) ranked in the top thirty vote-getters in Tehran. According to Iranian press, the runoff elections are scheduled for late April, and the remaining Tehran seats will be contested then, along with seats in 41 other constituencies.  All of the political groups are proclaiming victory in their public statements; conservatives because they dominated, and reformers because they appear to have retained a decent minority, despite deep cuts in their roster.  Political alliances and bandwagoning  ------------------------------------  4.(S) One Iranian-American political consultant told IRPOff that overall, it is more significant to differentiate between provincial MPs and MPs in large cities than to categorize all 290 MPs along ideological lines.  Echoing what a US-based Iranian analyst told IRPOff separately, the consultant said that the elections in the provinces are much more about local issues than national politics. A separate Tehran-based Iranian analyst argued in an analytical assessment of the elections that only about 70 of the 290 MPs have influence in national policy making.  The provincial MPs are more likely to bandwagon with whichever political grouping is most powerful in the Majles, in  RPO DUBAI 00000015  002.2 OF 003   order to get support for bills and projects that benefit their province, the consultant asserted.  Two exceptions, he said, are former SNCS Secretary Larijani, who was elected to a seat in Qom with 76% of the vote, and Alaeddin Borujerdi from Borujerd, who is currently the chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee and was reelected.  Both are likely to be strong national political figures.  Majles leadership  --------------------  5.(S) Following the runoff elections scheduled for late April, the first order of business for the newly elected Majles will be to vote on the Majles leadership positions, called the Presiding Board.  The positions of Majles speaker and the deputy speakers will be decided at that time, along with the leadership and membership of parliamentary commissions.  According to several sources, it is unlikely that Larijani would immediately challenge sitting Speaker Haddad-Adel for the position although he may do so in 2009.  (Note: The term of presiding board is one year. Endnote.)  He predicted that Larijani would likely be the first deputy speaker, or the chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy commission.  The consultant also noted that the Majles has the power to disqualify newly elected MPs, and could use this to manipulate the final elections results. (Note: The contact did not specify the legal basis for this authority. Endnote.) The contact stated that this was how current Majles speaker Haddad-Adel came into parliament, since Haddad-Adel had placed 31st on the list for the 30 Tehran seats in the 2004 Majles elections.  According to the consultant, the Majles then disqualified one of the 30 newly elected MPs, so that Haddad-Adel moved up on the list and claimed the 30th seat in Tehran.  While he did not predict such tactics would be used by the newly elected Majles, he noted the possibility.  The rise of technocrats?  -----------------------------  6.(S) Analysts and observers appear to agree that although conservatives retain control of the Majles, the influence of Ahmadinejad loyalists appears to have weakened. As a result, this Majles is more likely to be at odds with the president's administration, particularly on domestic economic issues.  The Tehran-based political analyst characterized the trend as the rise of technocratic MPs, who are likely to prioritize action over ideology.  This "faction" takes its lead from the triumvirate of pragmatic conservatives, former National Security Council Secretary Larijani, former IRGC commander Rezaie, and Tehran mayor Qalibaf, the analyst asserted.  A US-based academic wrote that the only significant political implication of the rise of pragmatic conservatives is the challenge that those associated with that "faction," such as Larijani or Qalibaf, might pose to Ahmadinejad in the 2009 presidential elections.  Reformers and other minorities  -------------------------------------  7.(S) As noted in reftel, reformers fared better than expected, based on partial results, though they remain a minority in the Majles.  Although final numbers of their representation will not be known until after the runoffs, one US-based analyst warned in an article posted on the "Informed Comment" blog  that reformists trying to compete in second rounds may again fall victim to "election engineering."  She also noted that women fared badly: three won in the first round, none from the reform camp.  An untested source who claimed to be associated with the Alumni Office for Consolidating Unity, (Advar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat, the student opposition group) said that student activists boycotted the election because the Supreme Leader had pre-selected the winners.  8.(C) Among the five designated seats for religious minorities, it appears that two representatives are new, the Zoroastrian and the Jewish representatives.  (Comment:  We have not heard if the incumbents tried to run or not, but it is noteworthy that in 2005 the current Zoroastrian representative Kourosh Niknam publicly attacked Guardian Council Secretary Jannati, after Jannati said that non-Muslims were like animals loitering around the world spreading corruption.  Jewish representative Morris Motamed, who served two terms in parliament, also publicly criticized Ahmadinejad for his Holocaust-denial comments, as well as accusing state TV of airing anti-Semitic broadcasting. End comment.)  RPO DUBAI 00000015  003.2 OF 003    Predictions  -------------  9. (S) The Tehran-based analyst, whose own political views are centrist, wrote in a newsletter the following three predictions for the 8th Majles:  -- With economic woes now evident, the new Majles is expected to focus on solutions, not further exposure of Ahmadinejad's failed economic policies.  Disputes could nonetheless erupt if the president is seen as deliberately opposing sound advice.  -- Current Speaker Haddad-Adel, an ally of the president (and son-in-law of the Supreme Leader), is expected to retain his position for now, but he may resign in 2009 to run for president.  He is then most likely to be replaced by Larijani.  -- The Majles will not have much influence over the nuclear issue.  Nonetheless, he writes, analysts believe that 2008 will see important steps made to resolve Iran's nuclear file, mainly due to the fact that Ahmadinejad has lost his majority.  An indication of the changing dynamics is the fact that Iran has shown willingness to continue negotiations with the EU, even though the president initially stated that Iran would only interact with the IAEA in the future.  Analysts agree that the president is not sitting in the driver's seat anymore, but he will certainly continue to influence the policies directly and indirectly.  10.(S) Comment:  While this analyst's view may be too optimistic, given the generally muddy nature of Iranian politics, it would be a clear sign of a new direction of the Majles took on a strong, positive role in economic decision-making.  The economy is clearly Iran's weak point, with or without sanctions, not even rescued by oil prices at well over $100 a barrel.  Iranians frequently say that any faction that reestablishes relations with the US will win strong public support; it is equally true that any group seen as responsible for turning around Iran's economic mismanagement will likely be well-placed in the 2009 presidential elections, provided their candidate gets the Supreme Leader's backing.  Regarding the nuclear file, those decisions will remain firmly in the hand of the Supreme Leader and his closest advisors. BURNS

REF: RPO DUBAI 0008, 0012, 0013, 0014, 0015  RPO DUBAI 00000016  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns,  Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DoS. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary: Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf has made a reputation for himself as an efficient technocrat during his tenure thus far as mayor of Tehran.  In both his domestic and international trips and interviews, Qalibaf appears to be deliberately presenting himself as the anti-Ahmadinejad.  The rivalry between the two, both former IRGC, is widely known and has been noted in the Iranian press, largely in the context of turf battles over the Tehran municipality.  Although Qalibaf has not yet definitively declared he will run again in the 2009 presidential race, after his failed bid in 2005, his public statements and appearances all strongly suggest he will.  Most observers take it as a foregone conclusion.  2.(SBU) Summary continued: Qalibaf has done much in recent months to raise his international profile, including travel to the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos, where he met world leaders, and his trip to Baghdad, just days in advance of President Ahmadinejad's visit.  He has also given several interviews to prominent Western media outlets.  Although Qalibaf appears to be successfully burnishing his external reputation as a pragmatic modernizer and his internal reputation as an effective manager, it is too early to determine his prospects for 2009, including the crucial issue of support from the Supreme Leader.  And despite his comment in his Times interview that it is wrong to think there is a "dominant" desire for confrontation in Iran, it is also too early to determine whether a Qalibaf presidency would result in changed government policy. End summary.  Qalibaf seeks to raise his international profile  --------------------------------------------- ----  3.(C) Without clarifying why he is seeking out international attention, Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf has been raising his international profile with trips abroad, meetings with world leaders, and interviews in prominent Western press.  Qalibaf appears to packaging himself as the anti-Ahmadinejad, i.e. a pragmatic modernizer, not an ideologue.  At the same time, he is not straying far from conservative ranks inside Iranian politics, joining Ali Larijani and Mohsen Rezaie in forming an alternate conservative list in the recent Majles elections (reftels).  By no means is he sliding over to the reformist camp.  He also distances himself from centrists close to Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani.  When IRPOff asked an Iranian political analyst why Qalibaf is not politically linked to Rafsanjani - given his longstanding reputation as leader of pragmatic technocrats - the contact responded that Qalibaf would avoid links to Rafsanjani so as not to lose the favor of the Supreme Leader, who fears Rafsanjani as a rival.  4.(C) Contacts consistently rate Qalibaf as an excellent mayor, far superior to Ahmadinejad and better than Rafsanjani ally Gholam Hossein Karbaschi, who was mayor from 1988-98 but left in a financial scandal.  5.(C) Since the beginning of 2008, Qalibaf has given interviews to three major Western press outlets: the Financial Times (January 8), British newspaper The Times (March 14), and Time Magazine (March 18).  One contact said it was remarkable in the context of conservative politics in Iran that Qalibaf in his January 8 Financial Times interview named (among others) an American city -- New York -- as one model he used in running Tehran.  6.(SBU) In January, Qalibaf attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he met with several international figures including UK foreign secretary David Miliband and Swiss president Pascal Couchepin.  Qalibaf expressed interest in Miliband during his March 14 Times interview, saying he thought a new generation of politicians was emerging in the West.  7.(SBU) In late February, Qalibaf traveled to Iraq, only days before President Ahmadinejad's much-publicized visit there. While his visit was touted as forging municipality links between Iraqi cities and Tehran, Qalibaf also met with senior Iraqi government officials including Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih, Deputy President Adel Abdul Mahdi, as well as Baghdad mayor Sabir al-Isawi.  According to Iranian press, leader of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council  RPO DUBAI 00000016  002.2 OF 002   (SIIC) Abdulaziz al-Hakim hosted a dinner for Qalibaf during his visit.  8.(C) Even more notably, Qalibaf -- but not Ahmadinejad -- met with Grand Ayatollah Sistani while in Iraq.  Ahmadinejad's original travel plans included Najaf and Karbala, but in the end, he only visited Baghdad. (Note:  One contact recently noted that Sistani is very influential among Iranians who consider themselves religious but are dissatisfied with the current political regime in Iran. End note.)  While in Iraq, the Tehran mayor pledged his city's assistance on projects to rebuild Baghdad, Najaf, and Karbala, and announced that Tehran and Baghdad were setting up four joint working groups on engineering, traffic and urban transportation, education, and cultural services.  Biographical background  -----------------------  9.(U) Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf served as an IRGC officer during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, following which he was appointed by then-IRGC commander Mohsen Rezaie as head of the IRGC Air Force in 1997 to an open source biography.  Qalibaf remains a licensed pilot, piloting Iran Air commercial flights on a regular basis in order to keep his license current.  Supreme Leader Khamenei appointed Qalibaf head of the Law Enforcement forces (LEF, the national police) in 1999.  10.(U) Qalibaf was among the 24 IRGC commanders who warned then-President Khatami in a July 1999 letter that if he did not act to control student protests at Tehran University, they would take matters into their own hands.  In contrast to this hard-line approach, Qalibaf's 1999-2005 tenure as LEF chief reportedly saw fewer incidents of police harassment of students.  As head of the LEF, Qalibaf won public praise from the Supreme Leader and even from some reformist quarters for handling student protests in 2003 without excessive use of force by police, although he also accused some reformist MPs of inciting the student rioters.  11.(SBU) Following his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2005, he succeeded Ahmadinejad as mayor of Tehran (a position appointed by the city council).  If pro-Ahmadinejad supporters had done better in the 2006 municipal elections, Qalibaf would have likely lost his position, but he retained it.  12.(C) Comment: In his March 14 Times interview, Qalibaf said, "I would like the West to change its attitude to Iran and trust Iran and rest assured that there's an attitude in Iran to advance issues through dialogue."  He added that it was wrong to think that there is a "dominant" desire for confrontation and conflict in Iran.  That statement appears to represent a clear attempt by Qalibaf to differentiate himself from Ahmadinejad in the eyes of the international community, and to present himself as a less antagonistic alternative to Iran's current president. While there appears to be significant disaffection towards Ahmadinejad among conservatives, Qalibaf risks alienating the right-wing if he appears too "soft" on the West.  One Western diplomat in Tehran told IRPOff that a Qalibaf associate who was involved in his 2005 presidential campaign has since turned away from Qalibaf, saying he is not hard-line enough.  Qalibaf's Western-style presidential campaign (including, for example, stylish campaign posters targeting the youth audience, and photo ops of Qalibaf in aircraft cockpits) in 2005 generated criticism from the hard right.  13.(C) Comment continued: Of critical importance for Qalibaf's likely presidential bid will be the support of the Supreme Leader.  When Qalibaf ran in the 2005 presidential elections, some believe he initially had Khamenei's support, but that Khamenei switched his support at the last minute to Ahmadinejad.  Some observers have attributed this perceived change by Khamenei to the fact that Qalibaf ran a very Western-style presidential campaign; others claim that Khamenei's son Mojtaba pushed Ahmadinejad to the forefront.  In any case, Qalibaf will need the support of the conservative elite in Iran for a successful presidential bid in 2009.  If Qalibaf decides to challenge Ahmadinejad for the presidency next year, he will need to calibrate all his international and domestic steps to rally conservative support at home. BURNS

Despite the announcement on Iranian news, the Iranian-American said he still plans to travel to Iran April 10.  When asked by IRPoff if this was the right decision given his high profile, the AmCit replied, "when I left Iran and spent months in exile, what I realized is that the longer I stay out, the scarier it gets to return.  I guess I worry, but I just don't want to bend to the fear.  I do not think anything will happen...I keep wondering if I have let them win by folding shop and letting go.  I think if I pay anymore for sins not committed, i.e. if I stay out of Iran when I want to go - I will lose respect for myself."  Timmerman article  --------------------  3.(SBU) The same day that Iranian nightly news called the Iranian-American an "American agent," various on-line websites carried a story by Kenneth Timmerman titled "Pro-Iran Group Wants Iran Diplomacy."  In it, Timmerman "exposes" an invitation only conference that was reportedly held April 8 by the National Iranian-American Council (NIAC) in a US Senate office building. Discussing NIAC founders, Timmerman quoted a previous article by US-based political analyst Hassan Daioleslam, calling the Iranian-American a member of "Iran's oil mafia" for his former Iran-based company's presumed role in facilitating oil contracts for Norway's Statoil and France's Total.  4.(S//NF) Comment:  Since the release of Halah Esfandiari in August 2007, Iranians have appeared to be more at ease when interacting with IRPO.  However, with the April 8 public rebuke of NED fellows, we could be headed into another phase of crackdowns.  What remains to be seen is whether Iranians facing a possibly more restrictive atmosphere will "bend to the fear," or will take the attitude of this particular Iranian-American despite the potential consequences.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  The economy was the major focus of campaigning in the March 2008 Majles elections (ref A), and will most likely be a key campaign issue for presidential candidates next year. Failing to adequately redistribute oil wealth to the satisfaction of the Iranian people, as promised in his 2005 campaign, President Ahmadinejad is attempting to turn his economic record around before next year's elections by implementing former presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi's populist plan to provide "50 thousand tomans for every Iranian."  According to press reports, Ahmadinejad plans to phase out government subsidies of goods in favor of direct, monthly cash payments to every Iranian.  Economists, while supportive of the plan in principle, are skeptical of the ninth government's capacity to effectively implement such a program.  End Summary.  Economy takes center stage  -------------------------  2.(C) Despite increased oil revenue and continued economic growth of 5.3% -- according to latest official figures; rising inflation, sustained high-liquidity, continued high-unemployment rates, and international sanctions have given Iranians much to complain about when it comes to the economy.  The economy was a key campaign issue for parliamentarians in the March elections (ref A), and will most likely be hotly debated in next year's presidential elections as well.  In an April 2008 World Public Opinion poll, a 49% plurality of Iranians said they were "mostly dissatisfied," with the economy.  Economists inside Iran have repeatedly and publicly criticized Ahmadinejad for his failure to redistribute oil wealth and manage the economy effectively (ref B).  Ahmadinejad responding to public concern?  ----------------------------------------  3.(C) Ahmadinejad, in an apparent attempt to win electorate favor in the run-up to next year's presidential elections, announced at the start of the Iranian New Year (March 20), that he has a "new economic plan" that includes "big reform." According to an April 8 article in Rooz Online, if reports are accurate, after 2 1/2 years in office Ahmadinejad and his economic advisors have decided to implement the campaign promise of 2005 presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi.  During the ninth presidential elections, Karroubi's campaign promise was direct cash subsidies of "50 thousand Tomans (roughly $50 USD) for every Iranian."  4.(SBU) An anonymous "informed source" was quoted by Fars News as saying that "gradual payment of cash subsidies" is among the new policies set to be announced by Ahmadinejad.  The source added that "in the first phase of the program, energy subsidies such as gasoline subsidies will be deposited into accounts of every individual, and gradually people with high incomes will be removed from the list of energy subsidies recipients.  In the next phase, essential goods subsidies such as wheat and bread subsidies will be paid out in cash."  Echoing reports in Fars, the website Alef (affiliated with conservative MP Ahmad Tavakkoli) reported that "according to the most probable scenario suggested in this program, energy and essential goods subsidies will be paid in cash to different target groups.  In the program's initial drafts, it is expected that with the phasing out of these subsidies, their equal in cash payments be paid directly to all Iranian citizens.  An initial estimate has placed the payment for year 1387 (2008-2009) at 50 thousand tomans per month per person."  Economists supportive, but skeptical  ------------------------------------  5.(SBU) Since the announcement of the subsidy reform, the Iranian press has played host to a milange of editorials from economists.  E'temad newspaper carried one April 12 titled, "The cash subsidy scheme might be another blunder in the economy." In the article, the author claims that while the program has theoretical merit, implementation by the ninth government could have a "highly damaging and dangerous impact on our economy." "Few remarks by government experts suggest that the necessary  RPO DUBAI 00000020  002.2 OF 002   studies regarding the operational aspects of this project have been carried out comprehensively by an expert team and that the necessary ground for implementing the scheme is now ready...Previous experience in the ninth government shows that the government is usually unaware of repercussions and consequences of its economic policies and frequently rely on good will to resolve the country's economic issues," claimed the editorialist.  6.(C) Comment:  Reforming Iran's current subsidy regime could be a positive step towards improving the overall health of the economy.  However, as the economist pointed out if not implemented properly it could drastically add to domestic woes. Without careful management of the subsidy reform, inflation could skyrocket as prices adjust to market forces and further liquidity is injected into an already satiated market. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, "equitable" distribution of Caspian Sea resources has been an item of contention between the five littoral states: Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Russia and Azerbaijan. According to press articles, the Caspian is said to contain some 12% of the world's oil reserves, as well as huge deposits of natural gas.  Iran hosted the 22nd meeting of the special working group which is tasked with producing the convention for the legal regime of the Caspian Sea, April 15-16.  (Note:  the first meeting was held in 1991.  Endnote)  The five states were unable to come to a consensus in this latest round of meetings.  IRPoffs have been told by several contacts that if the US government would like to send a "positive" signal to Iran, it could publicly back the split of the sea into five "equal" portions.  End Summary.  2.(SBU) Tehran hosted the 22nd meeting of the Caspian Sea special working group, tasked with establishing a "legal regime" for the sea that is acceptable to all parties, April 15-16.  In past treaties signed between Iran and the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1940s, the two parties designated the Caspian as a lake; agreeing to divide the body of water into two parts and commonly share resources - which at the time was mostly fishing.  (Note:  If a body of water is labeled a "sea" then international treaties come into play, obligating access permits to foreign vessels - whereas if a body of water is designated a "lake," there are no such obligations.  Endnote)  Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, do not recognize the earlier treaties between Iran and the Soviet Union, and the five states have been attempting to "equitably" resolve issues pertaining to energy resources, fishing rights and security since 1991.  3.(SBU) According to press articles, the Caspian is said to contain some 12% of the world's oil reserves, as well as huge deposits of natural gas.  Furthermore, security and military rights are a topic of much concern.  In October of 2007, the five States agreed not to let foreign militaries use Caspian waters as a launching point for any potential attacks.  Iranian Commander Seyyed Mahmood Mousavi called for the prevention of any "alien" presence in the Caspian Sea April 18, saying that the littoral states do not want the Caspian to "become like the Persian Gulf."  (Note.  The article did not specify if Mousavi is an IRGC or Armed Forces commander.  Endnote)  To date, the five parties have only been able to agree on quotas for sturgeon fishing and have signed the Caspian Environment Protection Convention.  Options for division  -----------------------  4.(SBU) After failing to convince the other four members to stay with the original 50/50 split - forcing Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Russia to share half of the Caspian resources, Iran "compromised" pushing for an "equal" 1/5 division of the Caspian among the five countries.   Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan have consistently insisted that each state should be awarded a proportionate share of the Caspian based on its coastline.  Under this scheme, Iran would only be eligible for roughly 11%-13% of the Caspian.  Russia initially suggested a more complex equation of dividing the seabed (and the mineral resources that go along with it) along a sectoral line and sharing the surface (a.k.a. the fishing rights) commonly - with each state receiving an exclusive zone and sharing the center.  According to press reports, Russia now favors the same plan as the former Soviet States -- dividing the Caspian in accordance with coastline boundaries.  5.(SBU) The former Soviet States have signed a host of bilateral treaties amongst themselves, and with Russia --demarcating borders and apportioning resources; none of which are recognized by Iran.  Iran is insistent that a single, multilateral agreement between all five parties be signed. In a newsletter to clients April 20, an Iranian consultant and political/economic analyst claimed that Foreign Minister Mottaki has hinted at the possibility of Iran accepting a break-up that would give it rights over some 11% of the sea.  However, continued the analyst, many Iranian MPs want at least a five-way break-up and, at most, some revision of the 1940s treaty with the USSR which stipulated the sea's resources were "common" between the two countries.  On January 20, according to press reports, several MPs complained that the government was not "doing enough" on the Caspian issue.  6.(S) Comment:  Given the natural resources and security concerns, it is unlikely that the five littoral states will reach a resolution on the Caspian issue in the near future. IRPoffs have been told by several Iranian contacts that if the USG "is ever looking to send a positive signal to Iran," it could publicly support "equitable" distribution of the Caspian - granting each state 20% of the Sea, which is more than reasonable in the minds of many Iranians. An equal distribution of Caspian resources would still represent an overall 30% loss for Iran as compared to the original treaties signed with the Soviet Union. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  Iran's Central Bank governor may be the next casualty in President Ahmadinejad's cabinet reshuffling, according to press reports.  An economic consultant in Iran said that Central Bank governor Tahmasab Mazaheri ordered banks to begin implementing five new directives, in a bid to regulate the national financial market and curb inflation April 19, without first getting approval from Ahmadinejad.  Instead, Mazaheri reportedly submitted his plan to Ahmadinejad's government on the same day that he ordered banks to implement it.  On April 20, Ahmadinejad asked his Economic Commission to review the plan and called a meeting of top bankers in Qom.  Mazaheri was noticeably missing from the meeting, which has prompted speculation that he will soon be replaced.  Mazaheri was reportedly fired from his post as Economic Minister under Khatami after he refused to release monies from the Oil Stabilization Fund to influential reformists.  If reports of his dismissal are accurate, it again demonstrates the continuing difficulties facing ethical technocrats within Iran's crony-laden centralized economy.  End Summary.  Mazaheri's plan for controlling inflation  ----------------------------------------  2.(S) In the wake of the most recent dismissals of the Interior Minister and the Economic and Finance Minister, press articles are speculating that Central Bank of Iran (CBI) governor Tahmasab Mazaheri may be the next to go - despite having been on the job for less than one year.   The technocratic Mazaheri reportedly ordered banks on April 19 to begin implementing five new directives, in a bid to regulate the national financial market and curb inflation, said an economic consultant in Iran. The directives state that:  -- Bank Maskan will be the sole source of housing loans to first-time home buyers - state owned and private banks as well as financial and credit institutions will no longer be allowed to do so.  -- Banks can not rely on the CBI for cash when offering credit to eligible clients.  -- Banks can no longer use the deposits of usury-free savings accounts for investment in other areas.  CBI approval could be granted in exceptional circumstances, such as investment in key development projects and plans that can enhance efficiency and create new job opportunities in "deprived" areas.  -- Bank interest rates have been determined according to the level of inflation plus a marginal profit to be determined.  The CBI has set inflation in the last Iranian year at 18 percent, meaning the final banking rate is expected to rise from the current 12 percent in state banks to above 18 percent.  -- 33 percent of all banking credits will go to industries and mines, 25 percent to the agricultural sector, 16 percent to housing and construction, 17 percent to commerce and services, and about 9 percent to exports.  3.(S) According to the consultant, expected benefits of the plan are as follows:  -- corruption could be curbed by minimizing the activities of intermediaries in the financial network, if Bank Maskan was the sole financial entity offering housing and construction loans.  -- a better balance between supply and demand, enhanced management efficiency, and the ability to secure sufficient funds for the housing and construction markets.  -- could help the government to control and absorb excess liquidity from the market, a main factor behind the high inflation rates.  Government reaction to Mazaheri's directive  -------------------------------------------  3.(S) Mazaheri forwarded the directives to the banks and to Ahmadinejad's government at the same time, alleged the consultant, without getting the government's buy-off before  RPO DUBAI 00000022  002.2 OF 002   directing banks to implement his plan.  Labor Minister Mohammad Jahromi, who is reportedly a close ally of president Ahmadinejad and considered to be the government's economic spokesperson, came out on April 20 opposing the CBI package on grounds that increased banking rates of return will only hurt local industries, especially small to medium sized enterprises. Ahmadinejad also reportedly asked the Economic Commission of the government to revise the CBI plan, and called a meeting of bank governors April 20, from which Mazaheri was noticeably absent, according to press reports.    Bio notes  --------  4.(C) Mazaheri served as the Economic and Finance Minister under former President Khatami, until he was reportedly let go for refusing to release monies from the oil stabilization fund to influential reformists for unspecified uses.  Upon his dismissal he became the Managing Director of the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI).  When Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005, Mazaheri was appointed Deputy Economic and Finance Minister under now ex-Minister, Danesh-Jafari.  According to press reports, Danesh-Jafari lobbied hard for Mazaheri's appointment as CBI governor in the fall of 2007.  5.(S) Comment:  With a reputation as a technocrat and an apparent track record of probity in his economic stewardship Mazaheri is an individual who could, given the opportunity, positively influence Iran's economy.  Unfortunately for him -- and perhaps also for the Iranian economy--he may be made a scapegoat, again. ASGARD

Urbanization is one of the factors attributing to the rise in property prices, as demand outstrips supply. Additionally, wealthy Iranians view real estate as one of the few sound investments inside the country in an uncertain economy; as property prices went up a growing number of wealthy Iranian shifted their assets to real estate, say Iranian contacts.  According to two Iranian developers many home buyers cannot afford the steep prices and have few choices, especially as rents have also increased as a direct consequence of higher real estate costs.  Property prices in Tehran and other main cities to be provided septel.  End summary.    Housing Prices and construction cost on the rise  --------------------------------------------- ---  2.(C) According to two Iranian real estate developers and several visa applicants, the Iranian housing market has experienced a price hike over the past three years that has almost tripled home prices in Tehran, and continues with no signs of abating.  Though real estate prices have been rising incrementally in Tehran on an annual basis for decades, they affirmed that prices in Tehran climbed exponentially over the past three years, particularly shooting up in 2007, during which property prices essentially doubled.  Real estate prices in other parts of the country have also increased significantly, however in a more gradual manner, according to visa applicants. A young couple from Tehran described to ECONOff that the one bedroom apartment they bought for 78 million tomans ($78,000) in 2006 was valued at 170 million tomans ($170,000) in late 2007. (Property prices in Tehran and other major cities to be provided septel.)  3.(C) A long-time IRPO contact who owns a construction company in Tehran said in early April that the real estate market is still thriving despite his personal expectation of a slow down. He said in January he was able to sell his newly constructed apartment building in northeastern Tehran for about 400 dollars per square foot to one of Tehran's biggest real estate firms, who expect to resell the property at a higher price.  He indicated though that price increases make sense in terms of the recent rise in construction material costs; during the past three months he said steel prices went up 25 percent and cement went up by 50 percent despite the fact that Iran produces 60 million tons of cement a year, using 50 million tons internally and exporting the rest to Iraq and Afghanistan.  He added that these commodities are in the hands of government mafia types, without elaborating.  4.(C) An Iranian steel industry insider told ECONOff that another factor that has contributed to the cost of building construction is the increase in labor charges, as a result of the Iranian government crackdown on illegal immigrants, mainly Afghans.  According to him, many illegal Afghans immigrants worked in construction for low wages, as little as 2 dollars a day.  But since the crackdown only legal immigrants apply for work, and they want about 20 dollars a day (reftel).  5.(C) According to the Tehran-based developer, to obtain construction permits, one must get through plenty of government red tape, and bribes are often required in order to get things done.  An NGO worker visiting from Iran told ECONOFF that construction permits have been easier to acquire since Qalibaf became mayor of Tehran, apparently on the grounds that new construction brings in revenue for the municipality.    Main reasons behind the rise in house prices and rents  --------------------------------------------- ---------  6.(C) According to one Iranian developer who owns and manages construction businesses in various Iranian cities, the sudden  RPO DUBAI 00000023  002.2 OF 002   rise in real estate prices started simply because of the high demand for housing; demand for housing have been increasing as a result of population growth, particularly the vast population of young Iranians who are reaching their mid twenties, the age where many get married and try to shift to independent living. Furthermore there has been a population surge from rural to urban areas, particularly to Tehran, where people go to find work, attend universities, or move for a better lifestyle and better social services, mainly schools and healthcare. According to the developer, the real estate market will continue to grow for years to satisfy existing shortages and the upcoming demands.  7.(C) Iran's construction market has also been thriving due to an increase in investment in this sector.  According to an Iranian contact who owns an aluminum company, a great amount of money entered the real estate market over the past few years, particularly the excess oil revenue that is in the hands of certain connected government individuals.  In fact, he said many nice high rises are owned by members of the IRGC, illustrating economic corruption.  And he said the high rate of inflation in the past few years has also encouraged people to invest in property.  He planned on doing the same, complaining that there is no money in manufacturing anymore.  8.(C) Also, a Dubai-based Iranian who is a former economics analyst, told ECONOff that since last year affluent Iranians are increasingly opting to invest in the highly-profitable real estate sector.  He explained that prosperous Iranians who held on to liquid assets out of concern about international economic and political pressures on Iran can no longer ignore/resist the current opportunities in real estate and are shifting their money accordingly.  9.(C) A young couple, doctoral students at Tehran University, suggested that president Ahmadinejad's lowering interest rates from 17-18% to 11-12% also caused some individuals to buy real estate instead of saving cash.  Unaffordable housing a source of frustration  --------------------------------------------  10.(C) Many families are now facing housing problems, particularly in Tehran and other large cities.  According to one visa applicant from Tehran, a high school principal, many people simply cannot afford the current home prices, and young people are particularly suffering.  She explained that only wealthy Iranians can afford to buy homes, leaving most Iranians with no choice but to pay high rents.  Also, according to the young couple from Tehran University, many young families like them now spend one entire salary on rent; their parents recently helped them buy an apartment in Karaj where prices are low (about 150 dollars per square foot), but they are one hour away by metro to Tehran university.  11.(C) The Iranian developer, who has projects in multiple cities, also emphasized that many home buyers cannot afford the steep prices and have few options.  He said rents have increased as a direct consequence of real estate prices, and the absence of a mechanism for controlling rents has exacerbated the situation.  The developer said that the government is obligated to provide decent housing to meet the needs of ordinary citizens and is building more housing in city outskirts and in the provinces to encourage urban migrants to move back to provinces. At this point, however, he surmised that at best this plan can only meet about half of the housing demand.  12.(C) According to the Tehran-based developer, a longtime IRPO contact, the housing issue gets discussed in the Majles, but nothing significant happens to alleviate the problem.  He said in the past two years the government has started a program that leases land to government workers for 99 years under the conditions that they build their own home on it.  He said this program is unsuccessful because the lands are in undesirable locations on the outskirts of the city, and moreover, the people who need housing assistance often cannot afford builders' prices.  There are home loans available through Maskan bank (a government housing bank), but only in small amounts that are inadequate for buying or building a house, the contact said. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(C) Summary:  Northern Tehran has seen vast development in the past three years and housing prices have almost tripled, according to anecdotal comments from several Iranians passing through Dubai.  The northeastern quadrant of Tehran, particularly the northernmost Shemiran district is the most expensive, with prices comparable to prices in Bethesda, Maryland.  The provinces have reportedly experienced a more gradual rise in property values, and generally have much lower prices than Tehran.  All sources claimed that housing is unaffordable for the average wage earner throughout the country.  End summary.  Tehran property prices  ----------------------  2.(C) Real estate in Tehran is generally divided into the affluent northern section and the more modest central and southern parts.  According to a Tehran-based construction company owner and several visa applicants, currently the city's highest valued properties are in the northernmost district of the city, district One, also known as Shemiran.  And on the whole, districts One to Four in the upper northeast (Shemiran and its three surrounding districts) are highly regarded and have escalated the most in value.  This section apparently also has cleaner air as the winds blow the pollution away to the east, according to a visa applicant.  3.(C) Shemiran, at the very north/slightly northeastern edge of the city, contains the most expensive neighborhoods such as Elahieh, Farmanieh, and Mahmoodieh.  This is Tehran's most fashionable and vibrant district, and has seen feverish development in the past few years.  Its neighborhood of Elahieh is where the newest buildings, top-end shops, trendy cafes, and many fashionable locals can be found.  It contains the clubhouses of the German, Swiss, Belgian, and several other embassies and the well-known Fereshteh Avenue.  One Iranian contact, however, told IRPOFF that not everybody considers this part of town desirable, since the traffic often gets gridlocked on summer nights and the social atmosphere is "rather snobby." A visa applicant recently reported that a two-bedroom apartment in Elahieah can cost from 600-800 thousand dollars (600-800 dollars per square foot), up from 200-400 thousand dollars 2 years ago.  Even renting in Shemiran is challenging; adding that you need connections just to find these apartments and influential references to secure them.  Rent for a basic 2 bedroom apartment starts at about 1500 dollars and can much higher, based on the amenities the buildings offers.  4.(C) Prices drop by about 30 percent as you move to districts Two to Four  adjacent to Shemiran, (generally 200-300 dollars per square foot).  District Two holds the upscale neighborhood of Sa'adatabad, the modern and upscale Shahrak-e gharb, and Gisha.  Gisha is where Borj-e Milad, the world's fourth tallest tower now stands, and also where many affluent youth interact, according to a visa applicant.  There are also many affluent areas in districts Three and Four such as Vanak, Jordan, and Pasdaran, which used to be prized, but today the majority of these areas have become suburban and less chic.  Average property in Vanak now costs about 210 dollars per square foot, according to the Tehran-based construction company owner, and an upscale two bedroom apartment in these nice areas sells for approximately 350 to 450 thousand dollars.  Another visa applicant said that districts Five, Six, and Seven are also in the same range as districts Two to Four, and that this entire area is still undergoing rapid development.  5.(C) As you move away from the northeastern quadrant of Tehran property prices drop more - with property prices in the western regions of the city (districts 21, 22) starting at about 200 dollars per square foot and the in the southern part of the city from around 150 dollars per square foot.  Housing in the provinces  ------------------------  RPO DUBAI 00000024  002.2 OF 002    6.(C) Desirable real estate in major cities outside Tehran appears to be much less expensive.  According to visa applicants from provincial areas, the provinces have experienced gradual property value increases over the past 10 to 15 years, but with steeper increases in the past two years.  They shared Tehranis' views that buying property these days is like buying insurance, adding that the wealthy are buying entire apartment buildings or land and build buildings which they then rent out.  They portrayed their cities' housing situations:  -- Esfahan -- Housing prices have gone up about three times over the past 15 years, but the sharpest rise happened in 2007, when prices rose some 30 percent.  A nice property in the outskirts of the Zand-e Rud river south of Darvaze Shiraz would cost about 200 dollars per square foot, but northern Esfahan and the outskirts are cheaper.  -- Shiraz -- Prices have doubled in the past two years; according to one visa applicant, a 1000 square foot apartment now costs about 150 thousand dollars to buy and about 600 dollars to rent.  -- Mashad -- Property prices are about 200 dollars per square foot in an above average area such as Sajjad Boulevard or Ahmadabad. One visa applicant's apartment that was valued at 100 thousand dollars four years ago is now valued at 500 thousand dollars.  -- Tabriz -- Prices have gone up 50 times in the past 10 years. Ten years ago land was practically free in Tabriz, five years ago prices started to increase rapidly, especially in northern Tabriz.  -- Kerman -- Real estate prices here are about one fourth of Tehran.  -- Kermanshah -- Housing prices are about one-fifth of prices in Tehran.  Prices have gone up quickly in the past few years, particularly in 2007, which saw as much as a 30 percent rise. An apartment that rented for 220 dollars in 2006 was 300 dollars at the end of 2007.  -- Ahvaz -- Prices are about one-sixth of Tehran prices. Contacts report prices have gone up ten times in the past 3 years.  7.(C) Comment:  Iranian contacts involved in building construction and Iranian visa applicants eagerly shared their thoughts on the housing situation.  Their comments demonstrate the challenges facing the general population as the privileged few profit.  The drastic increases in urban housing costs over the past three years likely reflect increased wealth attributable to high oil prices, as well as much higher investment returns compared to manufacturing and other more productive investments.  In addition, heavy Iranian investment in expensive real estate in Dubai and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf region suggest that this phenomenon is not limited to Iranian cities.  End comment. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(SBU) Summary: The April 25 runoff elections for the Iranian Majles (parliament) confirmed that the newly-elected Majles will be dominated by conservatives, as expected.  The results of the runoff elections do not represent any significant changes from the results of the first round, held March 14.  Final results announced by the Interior Ministry indicate that conservatives have won 58% of seats in the 290-member body.  Reformists gained six seats over the 40 they held in the outgoing Majles, winning close to 16% of seats in this year's elections.  Independents won 24% of the seats.  (Note: Domestic press quoted the Interior Minister stating that conservatives won 69% of seats, however some independents were included in that figure. End note.)  In the important Tehran constituency, conservatives won 10 of the 11 remaining contested seats, with the other seat going to a reformist.  According to the Interior Ministry, voter turnout in Friday's runoff elections was 26%.  2.(C) Summary continued: Although these elections will have little direct bearing on Iranian foreign or nuclear policy, they will be relevant to Iranian domestic policy-particularly economic policy-as we enter the final year of President Ahmadinejad's first term.  Once the new Majles takes office May 27, their first order of business will be to elect the Majles Presidium, the speaker and two deputy speakers.  The holders of these influential positions can shape the tone of relations between the new Majles and the president.  There is a good likelihood that current Majles speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel will retain the position in the new Majles, although former Supreme National Security Council (SNCS) secretary Ali Larijani is reported to have his sights on the position as well.  Both men have had public differences of opinion with the president and could use the forum of the speakership to continue criticizing Ahmadinejad.  End summary.   Nation-wide and Tehran results  ---------------------------------  3. (C) Conservatives dominated the April 25 runoff elections for the Iranian Majles, as expected.  The results of the runoff elections do not represent any significant changes from the results of the first round, held on March 14, in which conservatives also won the majority of seats.  According to results released by the Interior Ministry, the two main conservative groups (UFP and BPCP) together took 170 of the 290 total seats in the Majles, giving conservatives 58% of the Majles. (Note: Domestic press cited outgoing Interior Minister Purmohammadi April 26 giving slightly different statistics, saying that conservatives will hold 69% of seats in the 290-member parliament, with 16% going to reformists and 14% to independents.  However, some independents were included in the 69% figure.  End note.)  Interior Minister Purmohammadi reported a 26% voter turnout in the April 25 runoff elections.  4.(C) The United Front of Principle-ists (UFP) has been associated in the press with President Ahmadinejad.  However, the UFP list also includes some of the president's conservative critics, including Elias Naderan, the top Tehran vote-getter in Friday's runoff elections.  The UFP won 27 seats in the runoff, adding to the 90 seats they won in the first round.  This gives the UFP 40% of total seats in the Majles.  In Tehran, ten conservatives and one reformist won the remaining 11 Majles seats in that constituency.  All of the ten conservatives are from the UFP.  5.(C) A separate group formed by Ahmadinejad's conservative opponents (Broad and Popular Coalition of Principle-ists, BPCP) won 11 seats, adding to the 42 won in the first round, giving them 18% of total seats.  The BPCP was led by a triumvirate of conservative critics of President Ahmadinejad: former Supreme National Security Council secretary Larijani (who was elected to a seat in Qom in the first round), former IRGC commander Rezaie, and Tehran Mayor Qalibaf.  (Note: Rezaie and Qalibaf did not run in the Majles elections. End note.)  6.(C) Reformists won at least 15 additional seats above the 31 from the first round, giving them close to 16% of seats.  The results of three seats were reportedly annulled by the Interior Ministry for unspecified reasons.  (Note: It is not clear how  RPO DUBAI 00000025  002.2 OF 002   the final results for those three seats will be determined. End note.)  If the results for the reformist seats are accurate, these elections gave the reformists a net gain of 6 seats over the 40 seats they held in the outgoing Majles.  Independents added 32 seats to the 39 from the first round, giving independents 24% of seats in the new Majles.  There are a greater number of independents in this Majles, and it is difficult to determine their political affiliations.  If a significant portion of these independents are reformist-leaning, they could add strength to the reformist minority.  Next step: Election of Majles leadership positions  --------------------------------------------- -------    7. (S) Once the new Majles takes office on May 27, their first order of business will be to elect the Majles Presidium, the speaker and two deputy speakers.  After that, the chairs of the various parliamentary committees will be selected.  The Presidium and committee chairs are influential positions, and provide venues for public debate and possibly criticism of the president's policies.  It will be noteworthy whether many prominent critics of Ahmadinejad gain leadership positions. According to one Tehran-based political analyst, current Majles speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel will likely be elected to the position again, out of respect, but with expectations that he will drop out to run for president in 2009, at which time Larijani would take the speakership.  8.(C) Comment: Although these Majles elections will have little direct bearing on Iranian foreign or nuclear policy, they will be relevant to Iranian domestic policy-particularly economic policy-as we enter the final year of President Ahmadinejad's first term.  However, some MPs may use parliament as a venue to highlight the negative economic impact of Ahmadinejad's foreign and nuclear policies on domestic economic conditions.  As the analyst suggests, there is indeed a good likelihood that current Majles speaker Haddad-Adel will retain the position in the new Majles, although Iranian press has reported that Larijani has been lobbying for the position as well.  Both men have had public differences of opinion with the president and could use the forum of the speakership to continue criticizing Ahmadinejad. Analysis of the significance of the Majles elections and results of the first round were reported in reftels.  End comment. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary: Conflicts between President Ahmadinejad and Majles speaker Haddad-Adel flared again when Iranian news published a scathing letter from the president to the speaker April 21 accusing him of violating the constitution.  This follows other public battles this year between the president and the legislature on issues including the government budget.  This latest dispute led to a comment by Supreme Leader Khamenei April 23 calling on government officials to avoid clashes and fault-finding.  This conflict may be important in light of the 2009 presidential election, as there is speculation that Haddad-Adel will throw his hat in the ring.  Both Ahmadinejad and Haddad-Adel are considered to have the support of Supreme Leader Khamenei, but if Haddad-Adel does have presidential aspirations, then Khamenei may be obliged to choose between the two men.  However, there is no clear indication as yet that Ahmadinejad has lost Khamenei's support, despite the widespread criticism of the president's economic performance.  End summary.  Ahmadinejad in public clash with Haddad-Adel  --------------------------------------------- ------------  2.(U) The periodic political scuffles between President Ahmadinejad and Majles speaker Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel reached new levels April 21 when Iranian press published a scathing letter from Ahmadinejad to Haddad-Adel accusing him of "illegal actions" and violating the constitution.  The basis of Ahmadinejad's complaints was Haddad-Adel's order to publish in the Majles Official Register the texts of some recent bills that had been voted into law by the Majles, but which the president had reportedly refused to implement.  Publication in the official register obligates the government to implement the law within 15 days.  According to the text of the letter published by domestic news outlet ISNA, Ahmadinejad wrote, "Who is responsible for these allegations and allowing the president's enemies to attack him?  Who should investigate your wrongdoings?  And how can this damage be compensated?  How can ignorance toward and breach of the country's constitution by the Majles speaker be justified and explained?  Is this not classed as a serious blow against the country's legislative system?"  The letter was published by several newspapers, but state-run television and radio did not report on the letter at all, for which they were criticized by a website close to the president.  3.(U) Haddad-Adel responded to the harsh public attack with a public letter of his own, defending himself and charging that the economic troubles facing the country are more important than Ahmadinejad's complaints in the letter.  The reformist Aftab-e-Yazd newspaper published the full text of Haddad-Adel's letter, which cited the constitutional obligation of the parliament speaker to ensure that the laws passed by the Majles are published in the official register.  Haddad-Adel called the tone of Ahmadinejad's letter "unsuitable" and that he did not intend to reply in the same tone.  The letter stated, "Dr. Ahmadinejad, you may be sure that most representatives and I personally intend as we have in the past to collaborate with and back Your Excellency's government...At the same time, the law has set certain duties both for the president and the speaker and members of parliament, and these must be done...People have greater and more important problems, the most important of which today are prices, inflation, and the very sharp rise in housing prices, as Your Excellency is well aware.  People expect parliament and the government to work together and find ways to resolve the economic problems of more deprived sectors, not confront each other at the provocation of politicians and political currents."  4.(U) The public disagreements between Ahmadinejad and Haddad-Adel first made national and international news in January 2008, over the issue of the government budget (reftel). The Majles passed a law in January requiring the government to supply gas to northern cities in Iran that were affected by unusually harsh winter storms.  Ahmadinejad not only refused to implement the law, but in a letter to Haddad-Adel called it unconstitutional.  A frustrated Haddad-Adel read Ahmadinejad's letter in front of the Majles, and asserted (accurately) that it is the role of the Guardian Council, not the president, to determine the constitutionality of Majles laws.   RPO DUBAI 00000026  002.2 OF 002   Supreme Leader mediates  -------------------------------  5.(U) To resolve the budget dispute in January, Haddad-Adel appealed for mediation to Supreme Leader Khamenei, who issued a somewhat vaguely worded statement that was interpreted as supporting Haddad-Adel's position.  "All the legal ratifications that have undergone the process specified in the constitution are binding for all branches of government," Khamenei stated. This latest dispute in April between Ahmadinejad and Haddad-Adel also led to a comment by Supreme Leader Khamenei--who generally prefers to stay above the political fray, at least publicly--calling on government officials to avoid clashes.  "We and the Iranian people should act in a manner that would urge officials of the country to work together in a harmonious manner, and to avoid differences, disputes, clashes and fault-finding among themselves," Khamenei said in an April 23 speech that focused on other issues.  6.(C) Comment: There is much speculation that Haddad-Adel is planning to challenge Ahmadinejad for the presidency in the 2009 election, and these public disagreements serve to differentiate Haddad-Adel from the president and his failing economic policies.  However, the key issue is the support of the Supreme Leader.  Both Ahmadinejad and Haddad-Adel are considered to have Khamenei's support, but if Haddad-Adel does have presidential aspirations, then Khamenei may be obliged to choose between the two men.  However, there is no clear indication as yet that Ahmadinejad has lost Khamenei's support, despite the widespread criticism of the president's economic performance. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S//NF) Summary: US-based Iranian political activist Mohsen Sazegara held a wide-ranging discussion with IRPOff during a recent visit to Dubai.  He gave his assessment of Iran's goals in Iraq, identified what he called the "Gang of 7" most influential current and former IRGC officers, and discussed the political consequences of the Supreme Leader's reportedly continued ill health.  IRPO is unable to assess his access, but some of his information tracks with other reporting.  Sazegara also proposed a plan whereby the international community should block Iran's financial access to its oil revenues to force Iran to negotiate; asserting that the primary goal of the ensuing talks should be to aid Iranian civil society.  Sazegara is unabashedly a proponent of fostering a "velvet revolution" in Iran, and claimed to be working with others in the US and European diaspora toward that end.  End summary.  Iraq  -----  2.(S//NF) In a recent conversation with IRPOff, Iranian political activist Mohsen Sazegara shared his thoughts on Iran's involvement in Iraq, Iranian leadership and the need for a "velvet revolution" in Iran.  Asked his assessment of Qods Force goals in Iraq and who controls Iran's policy on Iraq, Sazegara said that the Supreme Leader and Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani are in control of Iraq policy and that their primary aim in Iraq is to disturb and hamper US efforts there.  When pressed about Tehran's ultimate goals--i.e. are their actions in Iraq an attempt to prevent a US attack on Iran, or are there other reasons?--Sazegara conceded that Tehran wants to "keep the US busy" but suggested that US withdrawal from Iraq is also an Iranian goal.  (Comment: Sazegara seemed to imply that Iran is more focused on the tactic of hampering US efforts in Iraq than on their overall Iraq strategy.  End comment.)  Asked about Iranian support of Shia groups who are fighting Iraqi forces, Sazegara acknowledged the support, and added that he even considered Iranian government support for anti-government Sunni groups in Iraq to be plausible.  The Iranian leaders are confident that they retain sufficient support among some elements of the Iraqi government, he asserted, without naming any specific groups or individuals.  IRGC  -----  3.(S//NF) Among current and former IRGC officers, Sazegara identified what he called the "Gang of 7" most influential individuals.  They are head of IRGC Intelligence Morteza Rezai; head of IRGC Strategic Studies Bureau Mohammad Hejazi; IRGC Commander Mohammad Ali Aziz Jafari, IRGC Qods Force Commander Qassem Soleimani, former IRGC Commander Yahya Rahim Safavi, Supreme Leader's advisor and IRGC veteran Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, and head of state broadcasting Ezzatollah Zarqami, who was formerly an IRGC officer and a deputy culture minister, and according to open source information, a hostage taker.  4.(S//NF) Sazegara identified the Strategic Studies Bureau of the IRGC as an internal think-tank that holds significant influence and is sometimes consulted by the Supreme Leader. Khamenei exerts control through the IRGC, the MOIS, and a "parallel security force" nominally called the Security Division of the Judiciary Power, he said.  When pressed on the "parallel security force" Sazegara said it was comprised of many of the individuals who were responsible for the murders of dissidents in the late 1990s, but did not elaborate further.  Supreme Leader's ill health  ----------------------------  5.(S//NF) Sazegara claimed that Supreme Leader Khamenei is clinically depressed and sometimes leaves Tehran for mountain retreats for a week or more, leaving his son Mojtaba in control.  (Note: It has been widely reported in the international press that the Supreme Leader suffers from prostate cancer, however  RPO DUBAI 00000027  002.2 OF 003   the claim that he suffers from clinical depression appears new. End note.)  On some occasions, Sazegara claimed, Khamenei goes to a Qods Force base in the city of Amol in northern Iran because the base is very secure and the scenery is lovely and relaxing.  Rafsanjani trying to sideline Khamenei's son or Supreme Leader himself?  --------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------  6.(S//NF)  Sazegara said that Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani and the influential Assembly of Experts member Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani are both concerned that the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba has grown too powerful. (Note: See ref A for more detailed reporting on Mojtaba Khamenei. End note.) According to Sazegara, Rafsanjani and Mahdavi-Kani are not the rivals that the press portrays them as, and Mahdavi-Kani is not seeking the chairmanship of the Assembly of Experts.  On the contrary, he said, the two men have collaborated on ways to limit the influence of Mojtaba Khamenei and have been advocating the creation of a "Vice Leader" position, although apparently without success.  Sazegara characterized Supreme Leader Khamenei as weak and fearful of losing power, citing this as the reason Khamenei has not designated a successor.  (Comment: If this report is accurate, it is another instance of Rafsanjani working to limit the power of the Supreme Leader while Khamenei is still in office rather than after [ref B].  While it could indicate that Rafsanjani is moving more openly against Khamenei, it is also possible that he is laying the groundwork for the leadership succession, which Khamenei himself has neglected to do thus far. End comment.)  Military strikes?  -------------------  7.(S//NF) Sazegara expressed hope that there would be no military action against Iran, but said that if there were, then the best targets would be, for example, unmanned Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf.  This would be an effective show of strength and warning to the Iranian government, he claimed. Asked what the Iran government's response would be to such a hypothetical attack, and who would make the decisions, Sazegara said the final decision would rest with the Supreme Leader but he would be influenced by others.  According to Sazegara, Rafsanjani, Mahdavi-Kani, Judiciary chief Shahrudi and the Supreme Leader's advisor Ayatollah Nateq-Nuri would advise caution and counsel the Supreme Leader not to engage in war with the US.  Some in the IRGC--but not all--would also counsel stepping back, Sazegara said.  Asked what the "Gang of 7" would likely advise, Sazegara punted the question, saying that in addition to their advice, Khamenei would seek the assessment of the IRGC Strategic Studies Bureau.  Ultimately, Sazegara said he thought the chances were even that Khamenei would decide to either counter-attack or negotiate.  Human rights and civil society  ------------------------------------  8.(S//NF) Asked about the effectiveness of USG statements in support of detained or imprisoned Iranian activists, Sazegara said that they are helpful because they bring international attention to specific cases.  Sazegara recounted his own experience as a political prisoner in the infamous Evin prison, saying that the catalyst that led to his release was the death in detention of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, because the case brought greater international attention to Iran's human rights abuses.  9.(S//NF) Sazegara characterized the relationship between the Supreme Leader and the Iranian people as defined by two absolutes: Khamenei's absolute control, and the people's absolute weakness.  Sazegara said that civil society groups have become fractured and marginalized and said that he and others are working to unify the groups and bring them back into relevance.  Block Iran's oil revenue, then negotiate   RPO DUBAI 00000027  003.2 OF 003   --------------------------------------------- ---  10.(S//NF) Citing Iranian economist Mohammad Tabibian, Sazegara asserted that Iran's oil revenue is its key financial weakness and that though the banking sanctions are having an effect, for the sanctions to be truly effective, they must directly target Iran's oil revenue.  Sazegara suggested that once Iran's financial access to its oil revenue has been blocked, the international community should offer Iran a negotiations process similar to the Helsinki process, through which Iran would be allowed access to a specified percentage of oil revenue if it takes certain actions.  However, Sazegara cautioned against establishing parameters for how the Iranian government spends that revenue. Do not repeat the "Oil-for-Food" program that was implemented with Iraq, he warned.  11.(S//NF) Sazegara asserted that the first item on the proposed negotiations agenda should be Iranian civil society rather than the issues of Iran's nuclear program or support for terrorism. In order of importance, Sazegara said that the conditions for releasing Iran's oil revenue should be that Iran: 1) issues a general pardon for all detained and imprisoned civil society and rights activists, political dissidents, and journalists; 2) allows for a free press (i.e. discontinues censorship of publications and arrests/intimidation of journalists and editors); 3) holds a free election without candidate qualification by the government.  He stressed, however, that the general pardon was the most important item.  Asked what would prevent the Iranian government from simply re-arresting or otherwise threatening the activists who would be released under the proposed general pardon, Sazegara had no recommendation and instead emphasized the importance of the general pardon for mobilizing civil society.  12. (S//NF) Comment: Mohsen Sazegara is unabashedly a proponent of fostering a "velvet revolution" in Iran and claimed be working with other activists among the US and European diaspora to mobilize Iranian civil society toward that end.  IRPO is unable to assess his access, but some of his information tracks with other reporting.  Sazegara served as an IRGC officer in the years after the 1979 revolution and held several government posts in Iran until 1989.  He later embraced the reform movement and published several reformist newspapers.  He was arrested and imprisoned in 2003 and upon his release he left Iran for the UK, and then the US.  Sazegara is currently a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and also recently started a new think-tank called the Research Institute for Contemporary Iran.  In addition, he has set up two Farsi-language websites, www.rahbordonline.com and www.pishraftonline.com; the first is targeted toward students, and the second contains translated articles related to economics.

According to Sumi who accompanied Sasae, they met with a number of senior Iranian officials.  The most noteworthy comment of the readout was that Judiciary Advisor Mohammad Javad Larijani told Sasae that he wrote Iran's new proposal for comprehensive talks.  According to Sumi, despite no progress on the issue of suspension of enrichment and reprocessing in the Iranian proposal, the Japanese view Iran's proposal for talks as possibly worth exploring, although with a skeptical eye.  End summary  2.(S) Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Iran desk office Junichi Sumi, accompanied by Consul to Dubai Kenji Saito, met with IRPOffs May 26 to give an informal readout of Deputy Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs Sasae's trip to Iran May 23-26.  Sumi noted that Sasae would be meeting with U/S Burns in Washington May 28.  According to Sumi, this meeting in Iran was the 17th Japan-Iran Vice-Ministerial Regular Consultation, an initiative that began in 1991.  Sumi added that a few more director general level meetings have been proposed for this year, to cover human rights and nonproliferation and disarmament.  Interlocutors  ---------------  3.(S) Sumi said that Sasae and his delegation had dinner with Mohammad Javad Larijani, head of the Iranian Judiciary's human rights committee and brother of new Majles speaker Ali Larijani.  The party also met Senior Advisor to the President Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi; Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Dr. Sa'id Jalili; Minister of Foreign Affairs Mottaki; and Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Special Assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Acting Deputy Foreign Minister for Asian and Pacific Affairs Seyed Mohammad Ali Hosseini. (Comment: Sumi's only comment about Hosseini was that he was "unimpressive."  End comment)  4.(S) Sumi commented that the Iranian officials seemed to have big expectations from the Japanese, particularly in terms of support for Iran's position on the nuclear issue, but the Japanese official said they had not delivered anything new to Iran.  Sumi, who speaks Farsi, was previously posted to Tehran and has been working on Iran issues since 2001.  Javad Larijani  -----------------  5.(S) Sumi said unlike the other Iranian officials who stuck to familiar themes, Judiciary advisor Mohammad Javad Larijani gave clear explanations of Iranian views.  Sumi added that given how freely Larijani spoke with them, he assumed that Larijani must have close ties to the Supreme Leader.  (Note:  Sumi said that Javad Larijani also correctly predicted that his brother Ali would become Majles speaker a few days in advance.  Endnote)  6.(S) Sumi said that when Larijani traveled to Japan in February - reportedly on his own initiative - he discussed the nuclear issue and promised the Japanese a non-paper on Iran's views. However, after the next IAEA report came out that was less positive on Iran, the Japanese government never received the non-paper.  Instead, Iran issued a proposal for talks, called the Proposed Package for Constructive Negotiations.  Sumi thought it was possible that the promised non-paper had turned into the proposal document.  7.(S) Sumi said that Mohammad Javad Larijani told the Japanese that he was the author of Iran's proposal, which Larijani reportedly called a "grand bargain."  (Note: Sumi said the only other Iranian official who used the term "grand bargain" was Iranian Ambassador to Japan Seyed Abbas Araghchi, who then asked that he not be quoted to Tehran.  Endnote)  Larijani reportedly told Sasae in plain terms that Iran now feels confident with high oil prices and is ready to play a role in the region and to  RPO DUBAI 00000028  002.2 OF 003   cooperate on Afghanistan and Iraq.  (Note: Sumi said that Ambassador Araghchi had also said that Iran's proposal demonstrated Iran's confidence.  Endnote)  Larijani maintained that Iran had played a positive role in resolving the Lebanese conflict, contributing to the Doha conference.  8.(S) Larijani, who clearly regarded the proposal as a serious offer, claimed it was the first time that Iran announced willingness talk about all issues of concerns to all countries, including the Middle East peace process and Hizballah.  He indicated that although the wording was somewhat vague, more sensitive issues could be raised in the talks.  For instance, when asked by the Japanese about Israel, Larijani reportedly did not outright reject the possibility of discussing Israel in talks.  He did not respond, however, when Sasae asked if suspension could be part of discussions.  Samareh-Hashemi  ----------------------  9.(S) Senior Presidential advisor Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi surprised the Japanese by extending his meeting with them to close to three hours.  Sumi noted that Hashemi was "alone;" he did not have any of "his" people with him, only a few Ministry of Foreign Affairs employees.  Sumi was also surprised by Hashemi's character.  He was expecting a hardliner along the lines as President Ahmadinejad, but instead said that Hashemi came across as "normal," and when he spoke to the group in English, he came off as "human" and approachable, someone with whom you could do business.  Jalili  -----  10.(S) Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Sa'id Jalili reportedly spent most of the meeting discussing Iran's new proposal but, according to Sumi, said little that was new. Sumi noted, without going into detail, that Jalili had "interesting" views about other issues, such as North Korea. Jalili also asked about Japan's relationships with China and Russia.  Sumi noted that Jalili had a limp which he surmised may have been an injury from the Iran-Iraq war.  Sumi described Jalili's secretary as a real "Basij" who would not shake their hands.  11.(S) Sumi said that when Araghchi left his position as deputy foreign minister to become ambassador to Japan, they assumed the position was a demotion, but instead he was surprised to find that Jalili and Araghchi have a good relationship and appear to talk regularly.  When the MFA had asked Araghchi, in advance of the trip, for a copy of the Iranian proposal, Araghchi delivered, via a phone call to Jalili.  Mottaki  ---------  12.(S) The meeting with FM Mottaki also lasted much longer that expected, even though Mottaki was on his way to Syria. According to Sumi, he got the impression from FM Mottaki that he was irritated with the Japanese.  Sumi claimed that Mottaki is a strong advocate within the Iranian government for relations with Japan and surmised that perhaps Mottaki felt his faith in the Japanese had not borne fruit.  Iran reportedly took it as a "bad signal" when Japan implemented UNSR 1803.  Mottaki told the Japanese that they can do more both politically and economically in the Middle East.  Sasae explained what Japan was doing in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere.  When asked why the Japanese FM had not made a visit to Iran, Sasae responded that he would go when the environment was right.  Japan's take on Iran's proposal  -------------------------------------  13.(S) According to Sumi, Sasae indicated that Iran's proposal may be nothing more than an attempt to talk for the sake of talking, but on the other hand, it would be a shame to ignore it.  The international community could explore talking to Iran, while remaining skeptical of Iran's intent.  Sumi did not know whether if was true that Javad Larijani was the author of the proposal, but his own assessment of the writing of it indicated  RPO DUBAI 00000028  003.2 OF 003   that it was written by one person and by someone powerful enough not to be edited by others.  He felt it was very different from Iran's August 2006 response to the P5+1 package which he found very confusing.  Sumi added that Ambassador Araghchi told them separately that perhaps some of the elements of the new P5+1 package could be accommodated in the proposed talks.  Sumi also said that Araghchi reportedly says bluntly to the Japanese that the Iranians have to talk to the US. BURNS 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 IRAN RPO DUBAI 000030  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  6/12/2018 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IR SUBJECT: AHMADINEJAD ASSOCIATE ARRESTED AFTER ACCUSING CLERICS OF CORRUPTION  DUBAI 00000030  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Jillian Burns, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(S//NF) Summary:  Abbas Palizdar, a minor Iranian politician associated with President Ahmadinejad, is making headlines after publicly accusing high-ranking conservative clerics of economic corruption and then being arrested.  It is not yet clear what his motivation was or what impact his speeches will have.  Two Iranian contacts said they believe Palizdar's speech was given with the permission of Ahmadinejad in order to divert attention from the government's mistakes and/or make it appear the government was fighting against corruption.  However, it does not appear that the accusations received much coverage in domestic press until picked up outside the country, which would seem to undercut that argument.  Palizdar later gave an interview to Radio Farda, which is taboo in Iran (unless authorized by the government, as one contact surmised).  He was then reportedly arrested June 11, accused of publishing lies and disturbing public opinion, according to Fars News.  One Dubai-based analyst said that the significance of Palizdar's speech is not necessarily the accusations he made against important clerics, since rumors of corruption by prominent figures abound in Iran, but whether the fall-out from these accusations impacts the Supreme Leader's support of Ahmadinejad.  End Summary.  The accusations  ---------------  2.(U) Abbas Palizdar, a minor Iranian politician associated with President Ahmadinejad, reportedly gave speeches in May at Hamedan and Shiraz Universities, in which he accused high level Iranians of corruption.  Among those he accused were members of the Guardian Council, Expediency Council, influential clerics from Qom and Mashhad and even close advisors of the Supreme Leader.  According to press reports, Palizdar's accusations included the following:  -- Guardian Council member and temporary Friday prayer leader of Tehran Imanmi Kashani reportedly used his child's disability as a justification for taking over the licensing and operations of four mines.  Kashani reportedly asked for the revenues from the mines to construct a physical therapy center for his son.  -- Guardian Council member, Assembly of Experts member, former head of the judiciary, and head of the Teachers of Qom Theological Center Mohammad Yazdi reportedly made a large profit on a tire company after acquiring it at a fraction of its actual cost.  Yazdi was also accused of using his position of power to secure logging rights for his son in northern Iran.  -- Former speaker of the Majles and advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, former head of the Mostazafin Foundation Mohsen Rafiqdoost, former Secretary of the conservatives Islamic Coalition Association Asqar Oladi, Deputy Director of the Supreme Leader's Office (presumably Abdolhossein) Moezi, former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, and the Mashhad cleric Ayatollah Elm Alhoda were all accused of fraud charges involving Iran Khodro car manufacturing plant.  -- The Supreme Leader's representative in Khorasan province Ayatollah Vaezi Tabasi reportedly had 13 mines handed over to him.  -- Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi's son-in-law (FNU) Modalal was called the "king of the sugar mafia."  -- When asked about former president Rafsanjani and his family, Palizdar reportedly said, "their economic corruption is so wide that it is not possible to list them.  But one of them is in their lack of payment of taxes to the government."  Who is this guy?  ----------------  3.(S//NF) Press reports and Iran analysts differ on Abbas Palizdar's current or former positions.  Reformist newspaper E'temad called Palizdar a "barely known principle-ist" before he made his speech at Hamedan.  A Tehran-based political and  DUBAI 00000030  002.2 OF 003   economic analyst called him "a former economic counselor to parliament and an ally of President Ahmadinejad."  Later, in a newsletter to clients, the analyst said Palizdar is a "former member of the Majles' Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission and now Head of Parliament's Office of Infrastructure Studies."  4.(S//NF) A purported former IRGC general told IRPoff that Palizdar is very close to Ahmadinejad and that Palizdar was the government's representative to the Majles Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, which he described as the parliamentary committee that investigates corruption charges.  He said Palizdar was not a member of parliament.  The same source claimed that Palizdar waQormer IRGC member who had worked for him when the general ran the IRGC human resources department, presumably in the 1980s.  The general claimed Palizdar was extremely hardline, which necessitated close monitoring of his activities.  The former general also claimed that the source of Palizdar's information came from complaints that had been submitted to the Majles commission and may or may not be true, but had not been proved.  He said that the head of the commission had distanced himself from Palizdar's claims. Saeed Aboutaleb, whom the general claimed was the head of the commission, was quoted in the Washington Post saying that Palizdar "was helping one of the parliament members as an expert but wasn't present in the sessions of the committee that deals with corruption issues."  Palizdar's motivation?  ----------------------  5.(S//NF) What remains unclear is whether or not Palizdar was directed by President Ahmadinejad to launch an attack against conservative elements who are not considered allies of the president.  Press reports claim that Palizdar did not initially mention names in his speech, only accusations, but started naming names when pressed by the audience.  According to semi-official Fars News, Palizdar's accusations were based on a study he wrote that was reportedly commissioned by Ahmadinejad. Initial press reports were quick to point out that Palizdar did not accuse any of Ahmadinejad's close allies of corrupt practices.  According to BBC Persian, Hamedan University's Islamic Association is closely associated with Ahmadinejad. Non-governmental media outlets also associated Palizdar with Ahmadinejad, particularly since Palizdar ran unsuccessfully in 2006 for Tehran's provincial council on a list that supported President Ahmadinejad.  6.(S//NF)  The Tehran-based political and economic analyst claimed that some analysts believe that "Palizdar's intervention may have been a mechanism to test the limits of the government's criticism of the country's non-elected organs at a time when talks of (Supreme Leader) Khamenei's succession and the future of the velayat-e-faqih are taking shape."  7.(S//NF) Two IRPO contacts maintained that Palizdar spoke on behest of the president to divert blame and attention from government mismanagement, or to give the appearance of tackling the problem of corruption, particularly in the face of a new Majles full of presidential critics.  One of them, a former staff member of the Guardians Council, was particularly dismissive of the incident, saying that these claims of corruption made by Palizdar were old and widely known.  He felt that the speech was inconsequential political theater by Ahmadinejad, and none of those accused by Palizdar would be prosecuted.  (Comment: The fact that the speeches apparently got little domestic press coverage until picked up by oppositionist media would seem to undercut these arguments that the speech was deliberate Ahmadinejad-directed propaganda.  End comment)  8.(U) However, on June 11, BBC Persian noted a rush of Iranian press accounts critical of Palizdar and claimed that groups close to Ahmadinejad (no further information) appeared to be trying to distance themselves from him.  Fars News reported that Bank Mellat is pressing charges against him for not replaying a business loan he received 16 years ago of more than $6 million.  9.(U) In an editorial, BBC Persian asserted that Ahmadinejad supporters, particularly students calling for an end to economic corruption, may now feel let down by the president since his government appears to be abandoning Palizdar.  According to BBC's analysis, Ahmadinejad may be under pressure - including by those who were named by Palizdar - to stop talking about economic corruption.  If anyone takes too close a look at major  DUBAI 00000030  003.2 OF 003   economic dealings in Iran, the entire government would be implicated.  10.(S//NF)  Accusations of corruption are nothing new in Iran, underscored a Dubai-based Iran analyst to IRPoff.  Politicians are continually involved in "character assassination of one another," he said.  This source said it is more important to step back and do a cost-benefit analysis of whether or not - given the latest accusations against people close to the Supreme Leader - Khamenei would continue to support Ahmadinejad.  He argued that Ahmadinejad had served his purpose in the eyes of Khamenei; Ahmadinejad had diminished the role of Rafsanjani and pushed out reformists.  If Ahmadinejad and his allies continue to isolate themselves and challenge leading clerics, it may be too costly for the Supreme Leader to continue to back Ahmadinejad.  In any case, added the analyst, it is still "too soon" to make any clear predictions over Ahmadinejad's future.  11.(C) Comment:  The most interesting aspects of this case to date have been:  1) the fact that an associate of Ahmadinejad gave an interview to Radio Farda --during which he boldly defended his accusations and promised to reveal more evidence to support his claims -- an act that is proscribed in Iran and has gotten others jailed; and 2) reports that Palizdar has now been arrested.  One source claimed that Palizdar would not have spoken to Radio Farda without authorization from Ahmadinejad, which if true, would indicate a cunning use by the president of USG media.  However, the source's comment came prior to the news of Palizdar's reported detention.  Whatever the circumstances, none of our contacts to date view Palizdar's speech as a watershed event in Iranian politics likely to result in any real change.BURNS

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(S) Summary:  Iranian officials frequently complain that the influx of illegal Afghan immigrants into Iran since the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan broke out in 2001 creates an economic burden that Iran can no longer bear.  At a conference on immigrants in April, Iranian government officials said that Afghans make up 91% of the refugee population in Iran.  Iranian officials dispute UNHCR figures of Afghan immigrants at close to 1 million, claiming that Iran plays host to roughly 3 million Afghans.  It calculates the cost to the country at $2 day each, or $6 million a day, and calls UNHCR's grant to Iran of a $1 million per annum grossly inadequate.  An Iranian who until recently worked for UNICEF in Iran said that illegal Afghan immigrants, once deported, promptly return via Sistan va Baluchestan province in southeastern Iran.  Some provincial officials have decided to take matters into their own hands.  As of June 21, Gilan province in northern Iran will reportedly ban Afghan citizens from working and traveling in its borders.  End Summary.  UN recognition  --------------  2.(U) January 2008 UNHCR figures put the Afghan population in Iran at 894,000, second only to Pakistan as a host.  Officials from the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP) praised Iran in June for its assistance to Afghan refugees.  IRNA reported June 17 that UNHCR representative in Iran Carlos Zaccagnini as said, "We respect the grave burden shouldered by the Iranian government...Unfortunately, we could not fulfill our promises but the international community is serious to render more aid to Iran...Iran's actions in dealing with the issue of refugees, especially the Afghans, are very admirable."  Zaccagnini urged UNHCR to give Iran more assistance.  Separately, Fars News reported June 16 that WFP Regional Director for the Middle East and Central Asia Naila Sabra told Iranian press in Rome, "I personally thank the Iranian government for accepting over one million Afghan refugees into the country...We have long been witnessing humanitarian efforts graciously made by Iran to help its neighbors."  Real number of Afghans?  -----------------------  3.(U) Iran's envoy to the Food and Agriculture Organization told the WFP that more than 97% of Afghan refugees in Iran are not covered by the WFP food assistance program because they live outside official migrant camps where aid agencies can access them, as reported by Fars News June 14.  He said that out of the more than 1 million Afghan refugees in Iran, fewer than 27,000 Afghan refugees live in camps.  He noted that severe droughts and rising global food prices have put refugees living outside of camps throughout the world, including in Iran, in a vulnerable position.  4.(U) Counting both legal and illegal Afghan residents in Iran, then Iranian Interior Minister Pourmohammadi told an immigration conference in April that more than 3 million Afghan nationals live in Iran, some of whom have been in Iran three decades.  He said that "international organizations do not offer real help for solving the problems of these immigrants in Iran." Pourmohammadi claimed that of the $12 million allocated by the UN to assist Afghan refugees in Iran annually, only $1 million is given to the Iranian government and the remainder is used to cover the cost of UN offices in Iran.  5.(U) Director-General of the Foreign Ministry's department for foreign nationals and refugees affairs, Taqi Qaemi, was quoted in press saying that UNHCR's $1 million assistance is grossly inadequate, when one considers that at a very minimum, Iran spends $2 per refugee, per day, times 3 million Afghans - resulting in a daily $6 million dollar price tag.  6.(U) Qaemi said that 91% of refugees in Iran are from Afghanistan.  He claimed that the high influx of refugees has resulted in a host of problems for Iran, in addition to the economic burden, including: "illegal" marriages, orphaned children, and the trafficking of drugs, humans, and weapons.   DUBAI 00000034  002.2 OF 002   Greater crackdowns  ------------------  7.(S) An Iranian who until recently worked for UNICEF to establish "health posts" and literacy programs for Afghan refugees claimed that Iran started cracking down on illegal immigrants after it did not receive promised additional funding from the UN.  She said the refugee issue puts politicians in a difficult position as immigrants are seen as "eating up" money that could go to nationals.  Another reason for greater crackdowns and increased deportations, surmised the former UN employee, could be Ahmadinejad himself.  While serving as Tehran mayor, she said, he took a harder stance on immigration -- firing Afghan refugees working as janitors in Tehran municipality because he wanted the jobs to go to unemployed Iranians.  8.(S) A June 17 report from Fars News claimed that 103 illegal Afghans were rounded up in Sistan-va Baluchestan in 24 hours but did not say whether they would be deported.  The former UNICEF employee said that once deported, illegal Afghan immigrants often return to Iran via the border of the southeastern Sistan va Baluchestan province.  9.(U) Gilan province (located on the Caspian Sea) has reportedly decided to try to ban Afghans.  According to Fars News, the Director General of the Gilan province Bureau of Aliens and Foreign Immigrant Affairs Hamidreza Mohebbi recently announced that all residency permits and identity cards for Afghans in Gilan will be invalid as of June 21.  He added that Gilan "will be one of the provinces in which Afghan citizens are barred from living or traveling."  (Note:  We have seen nothing to indicate whether such a rule can be implemented or whether other provinces are following suit.  Endnote).  "Due to permanent nature of the ban on the presence of Afghans in Gilan province, all managers particularly, real estate agents, employers and contractors should refrain from any dealings related to property rentals and employment," said Mohebbi.  Better workers  --------------  10.(S) Despite Ahmadinejad's desire to employ more Iranians, an Iranian construction business owner in Tehran said he preferred Afghan laborers because they are better workers.  The businessman dismissed as negligible the impact of rising labors costs associated with the deportation of Afghan laborers in the construction sector (reftel).  While his labor costs have increased by 20% due to the expulsions of Afghans, he said this increase is minuscule compared to skyrocketing costs of construction materials.  11.(S) The contractor, who only works in Tehran, was also dismissive of enforcement of labor laws.  He said the Ministry of Labor is the only entity that has the jurisdiction to control work permits while Afghans are physically on a construction site.  While the ministry sometimes will fine companies employing illegal Afghans, they often accept bribes to overlook illegal workers.  The police, he added, can only "hassle" illegal immigrants when they are not at work.  12.(C) Comment:  As Iran's economy continues to decline, and oil and food costs rise, the costs of supporting a large refugee population will continue to climb, and Iran is likely to continue to try to expel Afghan refugees.  If Gilan province is actually successful in driving out all Afghans, as impossible as that sounds, it is possible that other provinces could follow suit.  It is noteworthy that Iranian officials included illegal immigration as a top concern that they would like to discuss in its recent proposed package to the P5+1 for constructive negotiations. BURNS

Ahmadinejad listed his view of the problems facing the Iranian economy, citing slow economic growth, unemployment, inflation, waste of national assets, extravagance, and the growing gap between rich and poor as the key issues.  The boldest feature of the economic plan is a reform of the subsidy system, an idea that the president first proposed in April, following the most recent parliamentary elections (reftel). Ahmadinejad also stressed the need for banking reform and a new tax collection system.  The subsidy reform proposal would represent a fairly big step, since the current system features heavy subsidies for gasoline, electricity, food staples and other consumer goods.  However, it is unclear when and how the plan will be implemented, if it is approved by the legislature. End summary.  Iran's economic problems: number one--slow economic growth  --------------------------------------------- --------------  2.(SBU) President Ahmadinejad unveiled his new plan to address the problems facing the Iranian economy in a televised address on state television June 24.  Ahmadinejad began his assessment of Iran's economic problems by citing slow economic growth as a key deficiency.  "We make huge investments and enjoy a high quality and quantity of human resources, the country's top managers and administrative organs work some 20 hours a day, but the economic growth of our country is not constant and sustainable, suffering greatly from [the] slightest shocks."  He called Iran's economic growth last year "satisfactory" but admitted "it could have also been better."  Referring to Iran's economic growth since 1998 (i.e. including the Khatami era), he said the curve of the country's economic growth since that time "shows great fluctuations."  Unemployment and inflation  ---------------------------  3.(SBU) Unemployment and inflation are Iran's second and third major economic problems, the president said.  Unemployment has been a problem in Iran for 40 years, Ahmadinejad said, lamenting that the rate has been in the double digits for most of the past 20 years.  "Of course we tried to decrease the unemployment rate to less than 11%, but this rate is not constant and has constant fluctuations," Ahmadinejad offered before moving on to the issue of inflation.  His presentation did not include a way to address the problem of unemployment, which is one of the economic issues of most direct concern to the average Iranian.  4.(SBU) On inflation, Ahmadinejad said that this also has affected Iran for the past 50 years, citing the "country's total dependence on oil incomes" as the main cause of inflation.  "In [the] country's development plan, efforts have been made to lower this inflation rate, but that has not happened and as a result we inject liquidity to the system in [the] form of making investments, but the output is not satisfactory," the president said.  Complaining about the economic planning problems created by inflation, Ahmadinejad added, "Inflation is among the major roots adding to deepening the social gaps and depriving the government of the chance to devise proper economic plans, while creating problems for the implementation of the government's various plans, and we therefore need to harness and decrease our national economy's inflation rate."  Waste, extravagance, and wealth disparity  -----------------------------------------  5.(SBU) Continuing the litany of problems affecting Iran's economy, Ahmadinejad cited waste of national assets and extravagance as two major issues.  "Currently the greatest waste is in consuming energy in our country...and we can for instance particularly refer to the waste of different types of energy, fuel, bread, electricity, and time."  Extravagance also plagues the Iranian economy, he said, "While our culture emphatically advises us to avoid it."  Briefly mentioning the drought affecting Iran this summer, the president cited the higher water  DUBAI 00000036  002.4 OF 003   usage in the agricultural sector as an example of extravagance.  6.(SBU) Ahmadinejad attempted to reinforce his populist message by then drawing attention to the widening gap between rich and poor social classes in Iran.  "Lowering this gap was one of the ideals of our revolution...what bothers us is that a large group [of] our society is deprived...since we are all members of the same family it is not right for some members to consume several times more..." Ahmadinejad said.  Addressing the problems: subsidy and customs reform  --------------------------------------------- ------    7.(SBU) The feature of the president's economic plan is a reform of the subsidy system, an idea that he first proposed in April, following the most recent parliamentary elections (reftel).  In his June 24 speech, Ahmadinejad said that the subsidies were meant to "support the low income and deprived social groups," and should be distributed in a "goal-oriented manner."  He added, "The current apparatus of paying subsidies is very problematic, since it is meant to help the deprived classes, but it works in the opposite direction."  Ahmadinejad's new plan proposes direct cash payments to low income families instead of subsidies.  "In [the] near future the National Statistics Center of Iran will issue a communiqui so that those who need to apply for subsidies would fill out forms that will be evaluated, so that with highest benefits we would leave behind the goal orientation period of subsidies," he said.  8.(U) Ahmadinejad also called for changes in the customs system.  "There is no connection link among the different customs offices nationwide either, which is why despite the hard work, the problems remain unsolved...the government is after solving this problem through ratification of a law," he said.  Tax and banking reform  ----------------------  9.(U) Calling to attention the problems of the tax system, Ahmadinejad said, "Since we do not have a proper tax collection system, many of our citizens do not even know they have to pay taxes."  To address that problem, "the government has devised the comprehensive, automatic information and tax collection system, that based on proper training and sufficient information dissemination can improve the country's tax collection system."  10.(SBU) While explicitly refraining from criticizing the managers of Iran's banks, whom he called "among the most hardworking social groups," the president said the banking system is also in need of reform.  The current banking system is not capable of "proper supervision over the process of economic activities," Ahmadinejad said, making a vague reference to corruption.  He continued, "It is possible for a small group of people to take advantage of this system illegally, but if this structure would be reformed this problem, too, would be solved."   Majles to examine plan  ----------------------  11.(U) The president's economic reform plan will now need to be reviewed by the Majles.  Majles speaker Ali Larijani told domestic press that a special economic committee will be established in parliament to study the plan.  According to Fars News, Larijani said that such a major economic reform requires a comprehensive study and careful preparations, and added his recommendation that the government should move very cautiously in regard to the economic reform plan and there should be no hurry.  He noted that no exact date has been set for the implementation of the plan.  12.(C) Comment: In the presentation of his new economic reform plan, as reported by Iranian press, Ahmadinejad spent more time listing the many problems that plague that Iranian economy than proposing specific methods to address those problems.  The exception was the proposed subsidy reform plan, which if enacted, would represent a fairly bold departure from past practice and run the risk of triggering public outcry.  The current system features heavy subsidies for gasoline,  DUBAI 00000036  003.4 OF 003   electricity, food staples and other consumer goods, which Iranians have relied on for decades.  However, it is unclear how and when the plan would be implemented, if it is approved by the parliament.  Majles approval of the president's plan is not a foregone conclusion, particularly under the supervision of new Majles speaker Larijani.  Larijani is a conservative critic of the president, whom some observers list as a potential challenger in the 2009 Iranian presidential elections. He may not inclined to assist Ahmadinejad's tarnished image as an economic steward in advance of these elections.ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary:  On May 15 IRPOff met with an Iranian ecology professor and his wife, a marine biologist and expert on sturgeon fish at the International sturgeon research institute in the Iranian city of Rasht, located on the Caspian Sea.  The couple claimed that Russia and Azerbaijan are producing pollution in the sea, making the waters unhealthy, particularly for sturgeon fish, the population of which is already threatened and declining.  The marine biologist said Iran is guilty of over fishing of sturgeons for the lucrative caviar market and both scientists claimed their government does not places importance on wildlife conservation.  Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the five states bordering the Caspian Sea, Iran, Russia and Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan have not come to a consensus on the division of the sea and its natural resources (reftel).  End Summary.  Pollution in the Caspian Sea - Russia and Azerbaijan blamed  --------------------------------------------- --------------  2.(C) On May 15 IRPOff met with an Iranian ecology professor and his wife, a marine biologist and expert on sturgeon fish at the International sturgeon research institute in the Iranian city of Rasht, located on the Caspian Sea.  The couple described the ecological health of the Caspian sea as poor and claimed that the neighboring countries are not doing their part to protect the health of the sea.  They claimed that Russia is the worst polluter among the 5 states that share the Caspian sea mainly because the Volga River, which provides 80% of the Caspian water, carries high amounts of domestic and industrial waste from Russia into the sea.  They ranked Azerbaijan second because of oil pollution, and lack of environmental laws; sturgeons, she said, are very susceptible to low oxygen and the current water quality is not protective of sturgeons.  They ranked Iran third because of over fishing, and said the other two states, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, so far have insignificant impact on the sea.  Caspian sturgeon faces extinction  ---------------------------------  3.(C) The marine biologist, who does research to conserve and restore the population of sturgeon, said that over fishing is killing this caviar fish.  She said the Caspian Sea is the habitat for more than 90 % of the sturgeon in the world and up to 90% of the world's black caviar comes from the Caspian region.  Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iran all border the Caspian and catch various species of sturgeons for their flesh and caviar, however in recent years over-fishing has threatened the species to the point that environmentalists advocate a total ban on sturgeon fishing until the reserves replenish.  She said the Sturgeon population is so low that they can hardly find fish for their research purposes.  The marine biologist blamed over fishing.  She said it's essential for the government to enforce proper monitoring to prevent the accidental catch of young sturgeons and spawners.  4.(C) According to the marine biologist, demand for caviar remains high with one kilogram of high quality caviar costing about 2100 dollars, and Iran has been playing a significant role in the lucrative market.  She said there has been a tremendous amount of sturgeon fishing in Iran in recent years, both legally and illegally, and sometimes they even come across poachers when they are doing field research.  She said they avoid them out of fear, and it is the government's role to control smuggling.  Government careless in protecting endangered animals  --------------------------------------------- -------  5.(C) According to the ecologist, the government places no importance on wildlife conservation.  Regarding efforts to protect the endangered Asiatic or Iranian cheetah ("yuz palang" in Persian), the ecologist told IRPoff that the Iranian government does not care about people, let alone animals, because many people do not have health insurance and cannot buy medicine.  For example, he said the government recently approved construction of a major highway that cuts directly through the main habitat of the endangered Asiatic cheetah.  Just 2 weeks ago one cheetah was hit by a car and killed, the global value of which he said was 25 thousand dollars.  He said environmentalists have very little influence on government behavior whereas wealthy developers exert a great deal of  DUBAI 00000037  002.4 OF 002   influence.ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary:  Coverage in the Iranian press of Iran's reaction to the P5+1 proposal suggests that the Iranian government may propose talks based on the proposal's first step of pre-negotiations, featuring a "freeze for freeze."  The Iranians continue to emphasize the common points of their May 2008 proposal and the P5+1 package and will likely attempt to add elements from their package as part of the pre-negotiations.  Ali Velayati, the Supreme Leader's Foreign Policy advisor, raised the possibility of a six-week prenegotiation period in an article reflective of the Supreme Leader's views.  The Majles, led by its newly elected speaker and former nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani, announced July 1 that it has concluded that negotiations should start and will debate on how to negotiate over the P5+1 proposal July 5.  This Majles debate could lead to an announcement of Iran's official position. Meanwhile, as the Supreme Leader and Majles have stepped forward on this issue, President Ahmadinejad has been uncharacteristically silent.  End Summary.  Indication of Supreme Leader's Position Favoring Talks, Potential Short-Term Suspension of Enrichment  2. (C) Iranian press coverage of Iran's reaction to the latest P5+1 proposal markedly stepped up over the last week, given the P5+1 mandated June 28 deadline for an official Iranian response.  On June 28, hardline paper Jomhouri Eslami, contained a long article by former deputy FM under Rafsanjani, Dr. Abbas Maleki. Maleki is close to the Supreme Leader's office.  The article outlined Iran's own nuclear proposal, the P5+1 proposal, the common ground between both, and the possible outcomes of negotiations.  (Comment:  All in all, the article's moderate tone, which also emphasized the positive steps taken by the US in recognizing Iran's right to a peaceful nuclear program and committing to respect Article 2 of the UN Charter on the non-use of force, may represent an attempt to prepare constituencies for dialogue.  End Comment)  3. (C) On July 1, the Supreme Leader's Foreign Policy Advisor and former Foreign Minister Dr. Ali Velayati extended upon Maleki's moderate tone on the P5+1 package in a lengthy article, again in hardline Jomhouri Eslami (Note:  Jomhouri Eslami is considered a mouthpiece for the Supreme Leader's views, and given Velayati's position, his remarks can be read as made on behalf of the Supreme Leader.  Endnote)  Velayati called for Iran to take an active role in the international scene through active diplomacy, including moving forward on the P5+1 talks. He considered P5+1 talks as a starting point for such active engagement.  He claimed that the US wanted to see Iran refuse the P5+1 offer so that it could later say to the international community "See, we told you there was no point in talking with Iran (direct quote)."  4. (C) Under these conditions, Velayati said, the best way for Iran to protect its rights, preserve its national interests, and to take an active role in the area of international diplomacy is to move forward with negotiations.  He discussed the issue of uranium enrichment and appeared to advocate a six-week suspension to allow for "pre-negotiation" talks.  Later he counseled Iranian policymakers and analysts to "speak with one voice" on the nuclear issue, given the capacity for rumor-mongering and misinterpretation.  He added that current international sanctions efforts can be viewed as an attempt by the P5+1 to weaken the Iranian bargaining position.  Therefore, he said, Iran should not allow itself to be weakened and could best address sanctions issues as part of the P5+1 negotiations.  5. (C) On July 2, Velayati further aired his - and purportedly the Supreme Leader's - views in another lengthy editorial published by the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) and also published concurrently in the French "Liberation," Italian "La Republica," and a Swiss paper.  This article sought to provide the context for the Supreme Leader's role as final decision maker on the most sensitive matters effecting Iran, including the most difficult diplomatic decisions.  It noted that the Supreme Leader preferred to let the three branches of the Iranian government handle Iran's affairs, and only got directly  DUBAI 00000039  002.2 OF 003   involved in policy decisions on extremely sensitive matters. The piece then noted the Supreme Leader's 19 years of experience in this capacity, highlighting his experience with diplomacy as a tool to preserve Iranian interests and identity.  After a brief - and quite balanced given the forum - overview of current regional issues, Velayati concluded by stating that to preserve the interests of future generations, a peaceful solution allowing them to inherit peaceful nuclear energy must be developed.  Common Points of Two Packages Likely Starting Point  6. (C) Iranian officials have continually stressed that the common points of the Iranian and the P5+1 packages could be a good basis for negotiations.  If they choose to accept a pre-negotiations start on the basis of the P5+1 proposal pre-negotiation phase, they will likely attempt to add elements of the Iranian proposal during this period.  On June 27, Larijani called the European promises a 'mirage' and said the West does not want Iran to have its rights.  However, he then shifted the focus to negotiations and said the logical way is straight forward.  If talks resume, the West can reach a joint agreement with Iran and these agreements will be the basis for further measures.  There's no need for a complete plan, he added, saying they can go step-by-step.  Majles Stakes Out a Role  7. (C) The Majles, led by former nuclear negotiator Larijani appears to be at the forefront of the Iranian official reaction to the P5+1 proposal, along with Supreme National Secretary Jalili (Note:  The Supreme Leader announced June 28 that Jalili, vice Majles speaker Larijani, is now his representative to the SNSC.  A move one analyst believes will allow the President's office and the Supreme Leader to share nuclear "victories." Endnote)  The majority of Iranian press coverage of the proposal appeared to cite Larijani and other MPs, and the role of the Majles in evaluating the proposal appears to be central.  If true, the proposed Majles debate on July 5 over how to start negotiations could be significant and may lead to an official announcement of the Iranian position on the P5+1 proposal.  8. (C) Following the Majles' closed session with Atomic Energy Agency of Iran (AEOI) head Aqazadeh and Supreme National Security Council Secretary (SNCS) Jalili last week, Majles Energy committee head Emad Hoseyni stated July 1 that Aqazadeh's report said the call for enrichment suspension in the current P5+1 proposal is not as strong as in previous iterations.  This comment could be an Iranian attempt to find a face-saving way to enter a pre-negotiation phase without suspending enrichment. Majles Energy committee head Hoseyni appeared to use Aqazadeh's report as a basis for advocating the start of negotiations, saying of the report that "it has a forward direction and we should start negotiations."  Ahmadinejad Sidelined?  9. (C) One actor conspicuously absent from public debate over how Iran should react to the P5+1 package has been President Ahmadinejad.  Other than two statements by his spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham, one on June 15 and another a week later, Ahmadinejad and his allies have been largely absent.  Elham's statements declared Iran would never give up its right to enrich, and the first came on the same day EU Foreign Minister Solana presented the package.  (Comment:  We are led to conclude that Ahmadinejad's silence on this issue may represent the wishes of the Supreme Leader to conclusively assert his control over this portfolio.  End comment)  Comment  10. (C) Barring any last second reversal or events, it appears that Iran will shortly announce its willingness to enter some sort of talks over the P5+1 package, probably including a provision for prenegotiations during a temporary freeze on enrichment in exchange for a freeze on any further sanctions. The Supreme Leader's position, as described in great detail, appeared aimed at preparing the Iranian public for dialogue and the "freeze for a freeze" tack likely represents a face-saving measure meant to enter talks without appearing to concede to international pressure.  On another front, FM Mottaki's announcement today of Iran's willingness to consider a US  DUBAI 00000039  003.2 OF 003   Interests Section in Iran must have come with the Supreme Leader's authorization.  It is still too early to tell if we are seeing a genuine shift in Iranian policy, but signs are encouraging that Iran may be preparing a new direction in its engagement with the international community.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary: The Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) plans to launch an entertainment satellite TV channel on July 9 aimed at Iranian audiences that will show movies with Persian subtitles.  The broadcast by the Saudi-owned, Dubai-based MBC will join a small number of satellite channels, largely based in the US, directed specifically at Persian-speaking audiences. IRPOff was told July 6 by the Group Director of Marketing for MBC that it was not promoting MBC Persia on its Arabic channels in order to avoid controversy about the channel's agenda, such as the suggestion in a Syrian newspaper that the channel represents Saudi efforts to counter Iran.  The Director also said he expects advertising on the channel within Iranian domestic and expatriate markets to provide high revenue returns.  An Iranian cultural figure in Dubai told IRPOff on July 7 he believes broadcasting American films is a good way to reach mass Iranian audiences and that the value of this kind of engagement has remained largely untapped.  Given the dominance of state-run TV in Iran, the channel probably will appeal to satellite TV viewers seeking additional entertainment options and programs in their native language.  End summary.  MBC Persia Launch Quiet But Important  -------------------------------------  2. (C) IRPOff met Group Director of Marketing for the Saudi-owned, Dubai-based MBC, Mazen Hayek (please protect) at MBC headquarters in Dubai Media City July 6.  According to press reports MBC Group's new free-to-air channel, known as MBC Persia, will begin broadcasting international movies and Hollywood blockbusters around the clock in multiple genres, as well as Farsi advertisements July 9.  Hayek noted that MBC was promoting the new channel on its two English-language channels, but not on its Arabic channels, describing this as necessary to avoid controversy about the channel's agenda.  Providing additional detail, Hayek said that there had been one negative reference to MBC Persia in a Syrian paper suggesting the channel represented a Saudi move to counter Iran.  3. (C) Hayek showed IRPOff the MBC Persia programming grid for its first week.  The channel will air movies serially from four to ten in the evening, with reruns during the remainder of the day.  The films were well-known American titles, mostly recent and in multiple genres.  Hayek said that the primary target for the channel was Iran, and that MBC expected very strong revenue returns from advertising in this large market, as well as among the Persian Gulf Iranian expatriate population, which Hayek said his marketing research put at 700,000.  In addition, Hayek pointed out that MBC Persia can reach Farsi-speaking audiences in Afghanistan and Central Asia, although its primary target market will be Iran.  4. (C) In a separate meeting with Dubai-based Iranian cultural figure active in education and the arts, Dr. Seyed Firouzabadi July 7, IRPOff asked about the project from the Iranian perspective.  Firouzabadi surprisingly claimed that he presented this idea to MBC several months back after his own efforts to create a similar satellite channel floundered.  In Firouzabadi's estimation, American movies are a potent means of reaching mass audiences in Iran.  While IRIB (Iranian government TV) does show American movies regularly, including some quite recent movies, the entertainment and cultural engagement value of Hollywood is still largely untapped in his view.  (Comment: Firouzabadi, an Iraqi-born nephew to the traditional conservative Minister of Justice, welcomed the project - a strong departure from some representatives of Iran's inner circle obsessed with countering corrupting foreign influences.  IRPO is exploring means to engage with the well-connected Firouzabadi on an American film exchange to Iran.  End comment)  5. (U) MBC Persia will be widely available to regional viewers via the Nilesat and Arabsat satellites.  The channel will be modeled after MBC 2, which broadcasts films in English, and will provide Persian subtitles in place of Arabic subtitles.  MBC Group's TV Director said the channel will be the first of its kind to provide this type of subtitled, premium content specifically aimed at Persian-speaking family audiences.  The group's marketing director said it is the company's strategic policy to launch customized channels catering to certain audience demographics, preferences, and needs, and that MBC aims  DUBAI 00000040  002.2 OF 002   to provide improved entertainment options for regional viewers. An Iranian satellite news Web site suggested MBC's motivation in launching the channel is to take advantage of the "hot" advertising market on entertainment TV channels.  No Official Iranian Government Reaction  ---------------------------------------  6. (U) There has been no reaction from Iranian officials regarding the channel, according to a BBC Monitoring report.  An Iranian news outlet that is close to the regime posted a report about the launch, but did not provide any comments.  Press reports suggest that the UAE in early 2006 agreed to an Iranian request to prohibit live transmissions broadcasting in Persian from Dubai, partly to derail plans for a European-based TV channel aimed at Iranian audiences.  The Iranian government sometimes jams certain foreign satellite channels and viewing satellite TV remains illegal in Iran.  Foreign Broadcasts To Iran  --------------------------  7. (U) There are approximately 30 to 40 foreign satellite TV channels broadcasting in Persian, most based out of Los Angeles and Europe, according to BBC Monitoring.  In addition to MBC Persia, BBC intends to launch a Persian-language channel in August or September, according to press and an Iranian journalist based in Tehran.  Background of MBC Group  -----------------------  8. (U) MBC, founded by a Saudi businessman and based in Dubai, has broadcasted a mix of news and entertainment via satellite since 1991.  MBC Group operates six TV channels, including the 24-hour Arabic language news channel Al Arabiya.  9. (C) Comment: MBC Persia probably will be of interest to audiences in Iran with access to satellite TV, as well as to Iranians outside the country, given the limited number of satellite TV programs broadcasting in Persian.  The channel's focus on film, which suggests it will avoid political topics and the impression of having a political agenda, probably will appeal given Iranians' interest in entertainment programming and alternatives to state-run TV, which is the most dominant and easily accessible media inside Iran.  Soon, MBC Persia may be joined with a venture by StarTV (NewsCorp) for additional Persian-language entertainment broadcasting into Iran.  IRPO will report on the StarTV project septel. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(S//NF) Summary:  Abdollah Shahbazi has been dubbed by Iranian press as the "second exposer" after minor politician Abbas Palizdar (reftel).  Shahbazi was reportedly jailed June 18 for several days and then escaped an assassination attempt July 6 after accusing high-ranking clerics and IRGC officials in Fars province of expropriating land.  According to press reports, Shahbazi is a founding member of the Intelligence Ministry's Center for Political Research and as such, also published documents in May detailing "secret talks" between the Supreme Leader and senior officials regarding the 1990s chain murders. Shahbazi, like Palizdar, has been linked to Ahmadinejad in the press.  One Iranian businessman, who claims close connections to power circles in Iran, postulated that Ahmadinejad is using the likes of Palizdar and Shahbazi as insurance against clerics who want to see him removed from power prior to the next presidential election.  End Summary.  The accusations  --------------  2. (U)  According to the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA), historian and Intelligence Ministry collaborator Abdollah Shahbazi was arrested June 18 on charges of "slander and spreading lies,"  after claiming that several high-ranking officials from Fars province had expropriated land.  Friday prayer leader and the Supreme Leader's representative in Shiraz Ayatollah Mohyeddin Haeri-Shirazi and Fars Province IRGC Commander and Commander in the Ansar al-Mahdi Army, Brigadier-General Abdoali Najafi were among those accused. Reportedly, Fars provincial prosecutor-general Ahmad Siavash-Pour said June 18 that the arrest came after 8 private individuals (including Haeri-Shirazi and Najafi) filed complaints against Shahbazi.  3.(U)  This is not the first time that Shahbazi publicly denounced officials on charges of economic corruption. According to the press, while speaking at Shiraz University in late 2007, Shahbazi named and accused "a number of" IRGC and governorship officials of economic corruption.  In an attempt to prove his claims, Shahbazi wrote a book titled "Land and Accumulation of Wealth:  The Genesis of a New Oligarchy in Contemporary Iran."  ISNA reports that the book was published on his website (www.shahbazi.org).  4.(U) This does, however, appear to be the first time that Shahbazi was jailed for making allegations of economic corruption.  Furthermore, subsequent to his release on bail, Shahbazi wrote a letter to Ahmadinejad claiming that an attempt was made on his life.  Edalatkhah website, which is affiliated to President Ahmadinejad, reported the assassination attempt on July 8 along with the following details:  "After a series of protest statements by Shahbazi about corruption and fraud in real estate deals in the province of Fars, armed men two nights ago chased his car and attempted to kidnap and assassinate him...when the chasers discovered that Shahbazi was not in the vehicle they were following, they beat up the driver and threatened him with a pistol.  They then attempted to kidnap the driver who after being hit in the head was forced to drive his car off a curb and then ran out of the vehicle to flee."  5.(U) In May, Shahbazi also made headlines after taking a dispute with Rohallah Hosseinian public.  Hosseinian is the head of the Islamic Revolution Documents Center and the judiciary's former representative at the Ministry of Intelligence under Ali Fallahian.  According to press, Hosseinian was insisting that despite a military tribunal claiming otherwise, former intelligence officer Saeed Emami was not a main perpetrator of the chain murders in the 1990s.  To prove Emami's guilt, Shahbazi published a partial account of a top-secret June 23, 1999 meeting.  Present at the meeting, which reportedly took place in front of the Supreme Leader, was then President Khatami, Nategh Nouri, Mohammad Yazdi, Expediency Council Chair Rafsanjani, former Intelligence Minister Younesi, Head of the armed forces judicial tribunal Niyazi and three officials in charge of the case.  According to Rooz Online, the question of how Shahbazi gained access to such sensitive information,  DUBAI 00000041  002.2 OF 002   particularly when it was never even available to the victim's attorneys, is still unknown.  Shahbazi's background  ---------------------  6.(U) According to open source information, Shahbazi was born in Shiraz in 1955.  His father, Habubollah Khan Shahbazi, was the last Khan of the Sorkhi tribes of the Kuhmarre Sorkhi region in southern Shiraz.  His father reportedly led Iran's 1962-1963 tribal rebellion against the Pahlavi dynasty and was then executed for his role.  A Tehran University graduate, Shahbazi was himself arrested in his youth for political activities against the state.  Before the 1979 revolution, Shahbazi joined Iran's Tudeh Party (communist party) and was re-arrested in 1983, but while jailed he reportedly collaborated with the Intelligence Ministry.  Shahbazi is said to be one of the founders of the "Center for Political Research" in Iran's Intelligence Ministry - a center that he ran for 10 years. Shahbazi was also appointed by the Supreme Leader to serve at the "Center for Study of Contemporary Iranian History," which is affiliated with the Bonyad-e Mostazafeen.  7.(U)  Rooz Online reports that Shahbazi, who retains close ties to the conservative camp and the "security faction based in Kayhan Newspaper and the Islamic Revolution Documents Center," is now introducing himself as being affiliated with the "President's Special Investigation Unit," which is headed by President Ahmadinejad's brother, Davoud Ahmadinejad.  Shahbazi's motivations  ----------------------  8.(S//NF) While little is reported on Shahbazi's motivations, he maintains on his website that he will continue with his crusade to expose economic corruption.  One long-standing contact of IRPO, who claims to be close to power centers in Iran, (Note: real level of access unknown.  Endnote) alleged July 9 that several senior clerics want to see Ahmadinejad removed and possibly even jailed prior to the next presidential election. The single-source claimed that clerics are concerned that if Ahmadinejad remains in power until the next election cycle, he will use surplus oil dollars to buy off votes and win a second term.  The likes of Palizdar (reftel) and Shahbazi, postulated the businessman, provide Ahmadinejad a little insurance.  If the clerics were to have the president removed now, it would only publicly appear to validate corruption charges.  9.(S//NF) Comment:  While the possibility of clerics wanting to remove and potentially jail Ahmadinejad can not be substantiated, anecdotal information suggests that Ahmadinejad is becoming a greater liability for the Supreme Leader in his constant attempts to balance the various power centers in Iran. Ahmadinejad, however, is cleverly staying close enough to Palizdar and Shahbazi to burnish his anti-corruption credentials with the populace, but far enough away should they be taken down.  It is still too soon to predict the fate of Ahmadinejad in the tumultuous Iranian political landscape. ASGARD

Both Kamiar and Arash have traveled repeatedly to the US since 2003.  An Iranian American resident in Dubai, who was questioned repeatedly by Iranian authorities in early 2007, indicated that Arash was also interviewed extensively by the Iranian government last year.  The Alaei family has not contacted IRPO and has not asked the USG to make a statement at this time.  End Summary.  Forwarded email  --------------  2.(S//NF) IRPO was forwarded an email from a regular Dubai-based Iranian American contact detailing the arrests of brothers, and physicians in the field of HIV/AIDS, Drs. Kamiar and Arash Alaei July 15.  The email originated from the Associate Director of the Open Society Institute in New York.  The text of the email is as follows:  "Two physician brothers, who have been recognized internationally for their work in the development of HIV/AIDS programs and services in Iran, are being held in prison by the Iranian government.  According to reports received from Tehran, Drs. Kamiar and Arash Alaei were taken to an undisclosed location sometime in late June.  The reason for their detention is unknown.  Ladan Alomar, Executive Director of the Centro Civico of Amsterdam, NY, a community based organization that provides HIV/AIDS services to the Latino community, received a phone call from a person close to the Alaei brothers and was informed of the situation.  The family and friends of Kamiar and Arash in Iran do not know where and under what charges the brothers are being held.  The authorities in Tehran have provided no information about their whereabouts.  Kamiar and Arash Alaei have visited the United States on several occasions to participate in professional activities and have spoken to various audiences about the situation of HIV/AIDS in Iran.  Kamiar is a doctoral candidate at the SUNY Albany School of Public Health and had returned to his country in early June to spend his summer vacation working there.  He is expected back in Albany in September to start the fall semester,  Early this year, the Asia Society recognized him as a 2008 Asia Fellow, 'one of 23 new fellows identified as being among the most promising trendsetters and emerging leaders in the Asia-Pacific region.'  In 2007, from October 3-6, the two brothers participated as speakers in The Aspen Health Forum, a prestigious gathering of US and international health leaders.  The event is organized by The Aspen Institute, 'an international nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering enlightened leadership and open-minded dialogue.'  The Alaei brothers have received international recognition for their leadership in HIV/AIDS issues in Iran and for helping to develop model programs to fight AIDS and address the needs of substance users.  (Iran has a serious drug use problem, particularly with heroin use, that has fueled the epidemic). They have been featured in interviews by the BBC, the Washington Post, and other media outlets.  Their documentary 'Mohammad and the Matchmaker,' which was broadcast by the BBC in June of 2004, features to two brothers and their work to address stigma.  It features Maryam, a 21-year old widow whose world had fallen apart after the death of her husband - a heroin addict.

More background on brothers  DUBAI 00000042  002.2 OF 002    ---------------------------  3.(S//NF) Both Kamiar and Arash have received US visas annually since 2003.  Arash was a participant in the first IRPO IVLP program in November 2006, on Public Health and Medicine.  He also attended meetings and a reception in honor of ECA Assistant Secretary Goli Ameri in Dubai May 4.  An Iranian American resident in Dubai, who was questioned extensively by Iranian authorities in early 2007, said that "Arash was under a lot of stress at the same time that I was last year."  4.(S//NF) Following up on two successful Public Health IVLPs in fall 2006, the Alaei brothers remained active in public health related exchanges, including two Child Health and Development IVLPs planned for later this summer.  In addition, Arash assisted in recruiting IVLP participants in several non-public health areas.  5.(S//NF) Over the past 18 months, Arash has been ECA's and IRPO's most active exchange alumnus.  On a few occasions he inquired whether he could serve "officially" as our main point of contact for exchange.  ECA/IRPO declined, believing this would make Alaei a target for IRIG retribution.  6.(S//NF) Over the past few months, Arash was also assisting on a maternal and child health exchange program arranged by ECA through IREX Yerevan.  Arash expressed concern to IRPoff during his most recent May meeting in Dubai about one aspect of the IREX program.  Iranian-Armenian IREX employees were reportedly recruiting and conducting candidate interviews in Iran.  While he expressed concern about the public nature of the IREX program, he has always felt the value of the program offset the risks.  7.(S//NF) As reftel details, an IREX employee working on this exchange was detained in Tehran on June 26.  At time of reftel message, Dr. Arash Alaei was also suspected of being detained. Based on the new information, it now appears that Dr. Kamiar Alaei was also detained at the same time.  Potential assistance by USG  ---------------------------  8.(S//NF)  IRPO has not been contacted by the Alaei family and has not been asked for any USG assistance or to make any public statements.  The Iranian American said he does not know the family personally, but suggested that Jamie Metzel at the Asia Society "would be the one to contact."  IRPO has been in touch with IREX and have asked them to coordinate any inquiries from their Washington DC office with NEA/IR. ASGARD 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000043  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  7/24/2018 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IR, KPAO SUBJECT: FORMER MP AND JOURNALIST ON VOA PROGRAMMING  DUBAI 00000043  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary: Voice of America (VOA) is well-positioned as an alternative to state-run Iranian TV to provide uncensored, impartial information that can help advance reform in Iran, a former reformist member of Iran's Sixth Majles and journalist told IRPOff 22 July.  The former MP is in contact with VOA officials regarding programming concepts and was very interested in suggesting improvements that he believed would help VOA increase its audience inside Iran.  He claimed that elite audiences in Iran prefer VOA to other foreign news broadcasts, specifically BBC.  The former MP alleged that since the Iranian government is concerned about the impact of VOA, it does not object to other foreign TV programs because they help dilute VOA's potential audience share.  Separate from VOA programming, he suggested that IRPO publish a weekly aimed at Iranians to address events that the Iranian government otherwise does not report about. End summary.  Recommendations For VOA Programming To Help Expand Audience  --------------------------------------------- --------------  2. (C) IRPOff met with former reformist member of Iran's Sixth Majles Ali Nazeri (please protect), who is also a former journalist, on 22 July.  The former MP claimed that Voice of America (VOA) is well-positioned to provide uncensored news regarding events inside Iran, in contrast to state-run TV that strictly controls the message, but he believed VOA could do more to attract additional viewers.  He suggested that VOA devote 80 to 90 percent of its content to news and information that is impartial, which would be viewed by Iranians as more credible. He added that guests on VOA who are experts in their field, well-known, and knowledgeable, would be respected by viewers.  3. (C) He said that VOA should become more "Iranian," by including additional Iranian cultural program content, such as music and Iranian movies, including material banned from broadcast/distribution in Iran.  The former MP suggested that a large portion of the population would like to watch more dance and music programs, and that adding 10 to 15 minutes of music to VOA's evening schedule would attract a wider family audience. He suggested that VOA broadcast concerts by Iranian musicians, including those whose music currently is banned in Iran, and particularly pop music.   He explained that VOA is only received in major cities, as in smaller provincial areas it is easier for the IRIG to enforce the satellite ban.  This same issue of access to broadcast signals outside major cities also affected radio broadcasts, and he argued that VOA and Radio Farda would be more accessible to Iranians if the programs were broadcast using medium-wave.  VOA Helps Undermine Hardliners  ------------------------------  4. (C) The former MP argued that reform would advance in Iran if people were more aware of events, and he suggested that VOA could provide this knowledge because it serves as an uncensored source of information.  Alleging that there is a silent majority (the exact term he used was "turned-off majority") of approximately 15 to 16 million Iranians who do not participate in elections and are otherwise withdrawn from the political process entirely, the former MP said that VOA is a good outlet with which to reach this majority.  He added that supporters of VOA are increasing daily and that the impact of the programming is "more than if there were 100 wars," as it helps undermine Iran's hardline leaders.  Responding to IRPOff's question about whether Iranians are interested in a foreign media outlet's perspective about events taking place inside their country, the former MP said they are interested in outside messages as long as they are balanced and well-done.  Furthermore, given heavy IRIG censorship, there was no access to uncensored information about Iran internal affairs.  VOA Most Preferred Foreign Broadcast Among Elite Audiences  --------------------------------------------- -------------  5. (C) The former MP estimated that VOA TV is watched by 7 to 10 million viewers, primarily in large Iranian cities, and is less watched in small towns because of limited satellite TV access. Popular programs include News and Views (Khabarha va Nazarha);  DUBAI 00000043  002.2 OF 002   NewsTalk (Tafsir-e Khabar), which he described as the most popular news analysis program; and Nightsong (Shabahang), which he said appeals to Iranian family audiences. He explained that Iranian youth like Shabahang because of its cultural content and it appeals to their interest in fashion and movies.  He has three cousins from a conservative family who do not have a satellite dish and are not allowed to watch satellite TV, but whenever they visit the former MP they watch Shabahang.  6. (C) He noted that Iranian intellectuals, students, and educated elites watch VOA rather than the expatriate channels broadcasted from Los Angeles.  According to the former MP, the LA programs are cheaply produced, ill-informed, and often have simplistic political messages consisting of "cursing" the Iranian government.  He said these programs sometimes insult Islam, which alienates people in Iran who may be opposed to the Iranian government but not to the Islamic religion.  However, he indicated that members of Iran's middle and lower classes like watching the LA channels for entertainment.  When IRPOff asked about the popularity of BBC the former MP said that Iranians prefer American broadcasts, as the British are not well-liked and BBC's reputation has suffered since the revolution.  If VOA could improve its programming, it could more effectively compete with foreign broadcasts such as BBC, he said.  Iranian Government Reaction To Foreign TV Programs  --------------------------------------------- -----  7. (C) The former MP said that the Iranian government supports the presence of other satellite TV networks, such as MBC and the not-yet-launched BBC Persia, as a counter to VOA.  The government wants these programs to be effective so that they dilute the impact of VOA, he claimed.  The former MP argued that Iranian state-TV cannot compete with VOA because VOA can report freely about issues while state-TV offers censored information from the perspective of the Iranian leadership.  He believed that Iran's state-run external media outlets, such as Press TV, were copying VOA and had learned from and incorporated elements of its programming.  Suggestion For IRPO Weekly Aimed At Iranian Audiences  --------------------------------------------- --------  8. (C) While noting that Iran's state-run media does not provide the public with information about certain topics, the former MP asked if IRPO could publish a weekly from Dubai aimed at Iranian audiences that would address internal events in Iran in an uncensored and balanced manner.  For example, he said that according to his media contacts and reading of the Iranian press, the state-run outlets had not publicized internally key elements of the nuclear issue.  For example, he noted that the mass of Iranians had no understanding at all of what the P5+1 offer contained, nor did they know of the current two week period Iran has to provide a substantive response to the offer. He suggested that an IRPO weekly would be a good outlet to provide this type of information, as well as other topics that are not being reported in Iran.  Biographic Information  ----------------------  9. (C) The former reformist MP was involved in cultural and media efforts during his service in the Sixth Majles and he also has a background in journalism.  He started the weekly newspaper Arzesh aimed at Iranian students, which was banned in 1999, and he worked for Kayhan newspaper during former President Khatami's administration.  He currently is doing freelance work.  10. (C) Comment:  The former MP spoke very highly of VOA and the role he believed it could play in Iran, to the extent that IRPOff had to press for information about other TV programs that may be popular among Iranian viewers.  He seemed most interested in promoting the benefits of VOA to IRPOff and explaining how he believed VOA could be made even more effective.  His suggestions that VOA provide more impartial and balanced programming, and include well-respected experts, echoed comments made to IRPOff previously by other Iranian contacts. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1. (C) Summary:  The UAE's first documentary film initiative, "Documentary Voices: Pulling Focus" was "a success" film festival primary coordinator Mashid Zamani told IRPoffs July 22.  Zamani said that while she faced many challenges during the planning stages typical to any new project, the festival met two important objectives:  it connected Iranian and American filmmakers and it offered to the Dubai public a much-needed documentary film platform.  Emmy Award winning documentary filmmaker Anisa Mehdi acted as Artistic Director for the film festival.  The Iran Regional Presence Office (IRPO) and the International Information Programs (IIP) bureau provided the initial project grants needed for the project, which helped to foster public outreach to Iranians.  Local institutions like the Dubai Cultural Authority and private sources augmented this seed funding, helping to increase the awareness of this art form in Dubai and drawing in Arab filmmakers.  Future festivals can include even stronger content and there is potential to hold such programs both in Dubai and Iran, Zamani said.  End Summary.  Film Program Planning Challenging but Worthwhile  ---------------------------------------  2. (U) IRPOffs met with Mashid Zamani, the Dubai-based Managing Director of the partially USG-funded "Documentary Voices" documentary film initiative on July 22.  IRPOffs were looking to gain insight on the challenges and successes of the program, in hopes of applying lessons learned to potential future projects. Varying degrees of support from partners; constraints on Zamani's time from fundraising efforts; and inconsistent oversight over programming made the planning and implementation of the program complex said Zamani, but she added that the festival did succeed in bringing together Iranian and American filmmakers and in educating the Dubai public about the process of creating documentary films.  Given these two successes, she sees the potential to have more film programs in the future in both Dubai and in Iran.  3. (C) Partners:  Based upon discussions with IRPO which began in 2007, IRPO and Zamani envisioned the project incorporating not only film showings typical to a cross-cultural film festival, but an educational component that would encourage Dubai-based filmmakers to learn about the full documentary film process from conception to filming since the field is in its nascent stage in UAE.  Given that the program was in Dubai, IRPO emphasized that UAE sensitivities needed to be addressed, meaning the festival would have to include Arab, and at least a few Emirati filmmakers.  To plan such a program, Zamani initially accepted help from the "grandfather" of Iranian documentary film and founder of the Kish International Documentary Film Festival, Kamran Shirdel.  According to Zamani, Shirdel was forced to resign from the Kish Festival, but he left with the support and movies of several renowned international documentarists, offering to Zamani a festival ready to be implemented.  Further, he lent to the film initiative expertise in management and coordination.  4. (C) Zamani said she cordially annulled her collaboration with Shirdel after several discussions because Shirdel sought an "unrealistic" amount of resources and creative control of the event.  IRPO then introduced Zamani to US-based filmmaker Anisa Mehdi (Note: Mehdi had been one of IRPO's first Official Speakers in early 2007.  Endnote) who was able to leverage her network to bring American filmmakers to the program.  Zamani said her collaboration with Mehdi was successful and she would work with her again.  Shirdel maintained a positive relationship, however, with the program's organizers - his film "Pearl of the Gulf" was shown on opening night.  Shirdel's Film documented the leadership and culture of mid-1970s Dubai and was a big hit with Emirati patrons.  Looking towards the future, Zamani noted that Shirdel would be a strong partner for a potential American-Iranian film festival in Iran.  5. (C) Funding: Initially, Zamani spent her efforts actively seeking Dubai-based public and corporate sponsors, including Dubai's Knowledge Village, the Millennium Hotel, and in-kind advertising contributions from the Arab Media Group.  IRPO gave a grant of $41,000 to Zamani that was amended to a total value of $53,000, and State's Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) contributed $60,000 to the program.  USG-support was not publicized because of the potential sensitivity of Iranian participants towards a program with US government  DUBAI 00000044  002.2 OF 003   involvement.  Also, the film initiative included films from the broader Middle East region, in addition to Iranian films, in order to make the US-Iran focus less prominent.  6. (C) Internal Support:  As the first of its kind documentary festival in UAE, Zamani found support for it amongst Dubai authorities and veterans of the festival scene in Dubai.  Early on, she consulted the Artistic Director of the Gulf Film Festival (GFF), which is organized by the Dubai Arts and Culture Authority.  The director was generous in his advice to her about effective ways to plan and market the festival.  She faced a minor setback, though, when the organizers of the GFF "purposely" set their festival dates for the same week as the initial "Documentary Voices" date in April, forcing her to reschedule the program to July, a time when many people try to escape Dubai's heat. Despite its less than ideal timing, the success of the Documentary Voices festival has already prompted the Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, which donated $40,000 to this year's festival, to reach out to Zamani to support next year's program more actively by folding it under their purview.  7. (C) Programming:  Zamani claimed that her preoccupation with soliciting financial support meant she could not maintain full oversight over the content and schedule of the festival, which was under the direction of the Programming Director.  As a result, she thought - and received feedback - that there was inconsistency in the quality of submitted films such that some films from the United States were "too basic and boring" compared to their Middle Eastern counterparts.  She heard from Emirati and Arab nationals that Arab filmmakers were not well represented.  From the outset, organizers planned for an equal proportion of American, Iranian, and Arab films and filmmakers but this plan was altered in the week preceding the festival when two of the Arab filmmakers (one a Palestinian who was unable to get a visa to the UAE) were unable to attend.  For the next festival, Zamani underlined the importance of allowing significantly more networking time for the participants, which this year's packed schedule did not allow. From informal discussions with participants, Zamani found that the most popular films were non-political, such as Satellite Queens, a film about female hosts of a primetime Arab talk show, and Aref Squared, an Iranian film about a poor cab driver in Tehran longing to meet a popular pop singer.  Connecting People and Future Prospects  --------------------------------------------- ----  8. (C) Iranians and Americans Interaction:  Zamani noted that the program brought together Iranians and Americans through a common interest and both groups were keen to view the others' films.  Iranians and Americans did not always socialize in mixed groups, but Zamani alluded that this separation can be partially attributed to the lack of formal networking opportunities in the full schedule.  Most of the participants were unaware of the USG funding in the festival and Zamani kept this fact under the radar as most of the audience was Iranian.  9. (C) Press:  There was extensive media coverage of "Documentary Voices."  Zamani advertised the film festival in several Dubai newspapers and did twice daily spots on Dubai Eye radio station.  She partly credited the continuous media attention to the presence of Maestro Nader Mashayekhi, a world-renowned composer who is the conductor of Tehran's Symphony Orchestra.  Iranian press covered the festival significantly, and Zamani did interviews with Agha's digital, Persian Media Company, and the Iran Student News Agency (ISNA). The media interest helped participant filmmakers gain exposure to the public.  10. (C) Future Programs:  The festival could be continued on a yearly basis and there are compelling reasons to host it both in Dubai and in Iran, Zamani said.  For artistic and "practical" reasons, Dubai should host this film program because it is important to promote documentary film in a region that has only produced three such films.  This festival directly responds to needs to bring documentary film to the public and to nurture budding filmmakers. Also, Iranian, Americans, and Arabs can more easily gather together in Dubai.  A joint American-Iranian film program in Iran, which has a sophisticated film industry, would meet "political" objectives of connecting American and Iranians.  Zamani has already heard from documentary film centers in Iran who have expressed interest in a joint project, including one headed by director Masoud Bakshi. An Iranian-hosted festival would be more sophisticated in content, opting for higher level master classes and joint panels rather than the basic workshops  DUBAI 00000044  003.2 OF 003   offered at this year's Dubai documentary film festival.

RPO DUBAI 0040; B. RPO DUBAI 0044  DUBAI 00000045  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Amy Madsen, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary: STAR Group (a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp) intends to launch a Persian-dubbed satellite entertainment channel from Dubai in November or December that will target audiences in Iran and the region.  STAR officials told the Charge d'Affaires in Abu Dhabi, Dubai Consul General, and IRPOffs during meetings on July 14 and August 3 that they received a Department of Treasury OFAC license for the channel, which is a commercial venture primarily intended to provide entertainment and advertising to the untapped Iranian market. STAR aims to avoid political sensitivities by only broadcasting family-friendly content.  STAR does not consider other Dubai-based Persian-language channels as competitors, and their main concern is to secure agreement with the Dubai Government to operate.  The Charge and Consul General recommended STAR mitigate any potential sensitivities with UAE officials by stressing the business nature of the channel, and STAR's representatives subsequently reported to IRPOffs that after meeting with Dubai officials they believed their proposal would be approved.  STAR's channel, which might include coverage of US-Iran cultural engagement, likely will be popular among Iranian viewers who seek alternatives to state-run and existing expatriate channels, especially programs that are appropriate for the entire family.  End summary.  STAR Channel Aims to Reach Untapped Iran Market  --------------------------------------------- --  2. (C) STAR Group officials Joe Welch (Senior Vice President of Government Affairs) and Sanjay Das (Executive Vice President of Strategy and Development) met with the Charge, PAO, and IRPOffs in Abu Dhabi July 14, and separately with IRPOffs August 5. Welch, Das, and STAR Chief Executive Officer Paul Aiello also met with the Consul General and ConGen PAO in Dubai August 3.  3. (C) STAR's new channel would join two entertainment channels currently broadcasting Persian-language content from Dubai, Persian Music Channel and MBC Persia (ref A).  STAR's channel would be a joint venture with Moby Group, a media development organization directed by the Mohseni brothers in Afghanistan that includes the Tolo TV brand.  STAR officials said they expect to invest $15 million in facilities in Dubai Media City and to employ approximately 40 staff, and will dub the programs in Kabul.  STAR plans to broadcast the channel via Hotbird and Arabsat, making it widely available to regional viewers with satellite TV access.  4. (C) STAR officials stressed that their aim in launching the free-to-air channel is to make a profit by advertising within the regional Persian-speaking market.  However, the primary target is Iranian domestic and diaspora audiences, given their untapped commercial appeal.  Programming would be geared toward women and family audiences aged 18 to 34, with advertising focusing primarily on women as STAR officials claimed they are the primary purchasers and decision-makers.  STAR did not conduct market research in Iran, but believed Iranian's interests and habits are similar to those of Asian audiences. IRPOff recommended STAR conduct focus groups to determine what topics are of interest to Iranians, however, STAR preferred to hire an Iranian diaspora female to advise on programming.  Channel Would Avoid Politically Sensitive Content  --------------------------------------------- ---  5. (C) STAR's CEO told IRPOffs the channel would provide "responsible, thoughtful entertainment content" and would not show news programs.  The channel would air 8 hours of programming daily from 4 pm to 12 pm, which would be repeated, to include American sitcoms such as Seinfeld and Friends, children's programs, telenovelas, educational programs potentially by National Geographic, and at least one hour of drama programs.  STAR would not initially broadcast sports or music content given the high cost of rights to these programs. STAR wants the content to appeal to the entire family, and aims to avoid programs that parents might deem inappropriate for their children.  The Dubai team would edit the program content, with Das serving as Chief Operating Officer.  6. (C) STAR eventually would like to produce content exclusively  DUBAI 00000045  002.2 OF 003   for its Iranian audiences, such as telenovelas or historical programs, and would consider using Iranian local coverage or employees (STAR Group received an OFAC license from the US Treasury Department to operate the channel).  However, their first priority is to establish STAR's brand among Persian-speaking viewers.  While the officials noted there are no Nielsen ratings in the region to determine viewership, they plan to launch a web site for the channel and measure interest based on the number of visitors to the site.  STAR officials said they cannot advertise the channel inside Iran, and expect promotion there to be by word of mouth.  Not Concerned With Competition  ------------------------------  7. (C) STAR officials appeared unconcerned with the few Persian-language channels broadcasting into Iran and did not view them as competitors.  They described their channel as unique because it would be the only channel providing a mix of general entertainment content.  They claimed that their drama programming, for example, would draw audiences more regularly than MBC's movie channel as viewers would tune in weekly to follow a story-line.  UAE Government Likely to Support the Channel  --------------------------------------------  8. (C) STAR officials, in their meetings with the Charge and Consul General, seemed most concerned that Iranian officials might complain to the UAE and pressure them to stop the channel, similar to the temporary closure of Dubai-based Geo TV channels broadcasting to Pakistan in November 2007.  Mission believes that while Dubai officials might object to news programming, they are unlikely to object to a channel broadcasting entertainment content.  It was recommended that STAR be direct with officials in Dubai regarding their intentions for the channel, emphasizing that the channel is a business venture to provide entertainment content.  Post believes it would be important to address any possible suspicions that the channel has a hidden political agenda.  9. (C) The STAR officials, after meeting with Executive Director of Media at Dubai Media City Dr. Amina Al Rustamani, told IRPOffs on August 5 that the advice they received was "spot on."  STAR's explanation of the channel as a business venture resonated with Dr. Al Rustamani, and she did not think Dubai officials would object to the channel.  STAR officials said she seemed unconcerned about the possibility of Iran complaining to the UAE, and was reassured by STAR's established brand, their intention to broadcast entertainment content, and the OFAC license approval for the channel's operations.  She said there are a number of applications for Persian-language channels pending that the Dubai Government would not approve.  STAR officials believed this was because the channels were not as established.  STAR Interested to Promote Positive US-Iran Relations  --------------------------------------------- --------  10. (C) Responding to IRPOffs question about including coverage on the channel of instances of positive engagement between Iran and the US, the STAR officials thought this was a good idea and that they might be able to incorporate such content.  They also expressed interest in partnering with IRPO on cultural projects, such as the recent documentary film festival supported partly by IIP funding in Dubai, where STAR could be involved while also promoting their channel (ref B).  11. (C) Comment: STAR's channel likely will be of interest to Iranian satellite TV viewers, and may be more popular than the recently launched MBC Persia (a movie channel) because it aims to provide multiple entertainment programs appropriate for the entire family.  STAR's channel is unique and seems well-placed to fill Iranian TV viewers' desire for Persian-language entertainment beyond the dominant state-run TV programs and limited number of expatriate channels, some of which Iranians view as out-of-touch because they include anti-regime political content and presenters who were popular in Iran thirty years ago. The possibility of USG/STAR cooperation is interesting but would have to be handled very carefully, not only for the sake of STAR but also for IRPO's local profile and UAEG sensitivities.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000046  SIPDIS  LONDON FOR GAYLE, BERLIN FOR PAETZOLD ISTANBUL FOR ODLUM, BAKU FOR MCCRENSKY  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/12/2018 TAGS: IR, PGOV SUBJECT: MAJLES APPROVES AHMADINEJAD'S NEW CABINET NOMINEES  DUBAI 00000046  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Amy Madsen, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DoS. REASON: 1.4 (d)  1.(C) Summary: Following a contentious debate over the qualifications of President Ahmadinejad's nominees for three Cabinet posts, the Majles approved Shamseddin Hosseini as Economy and Finance Minister, Hamid Behbehani as Roads and Transport Minister, and Ali Kordan as Interior Minister. Ahmadinejad has now made more Cabinet changes in one term that any Iranian president since the revolution.  The President created some controversy by announcing prior to the Majles debate that his three nominees had the approval of the Supreme Leader, which may have influenced the votes of some MPs.  It is unclear whether Ahmadinejad actually had Khamenei's support in this matter (an editorial in the conservative daily Keyhan suggests otherwise), or perhaps gambled that he could present the Supreme Leader with a fait accompli.  The vote was also read by some as a test of ability of the new Majles -- and new Majles Speaker Larijani -- to stand up to the President.  In this instance, Ahmadinejad appears to have won the day. End summary.  2.(U) On August 5, the Majles debated and voted on the three nominees presented by President Ahmadinejad to fill the vacant Cabinet posts of Ministers of Interior, Economy, and Roads and Transport.  The Iranian press described the president's nominations as surprising, since Ahmadinejad was expected to nominate the current caretakers of the three vacant ministries -- which he did not.  During his first term in office, Ahmadinejad has replaced the ministers of Economy, Cooperatives, Roads and Transport, Welfare and Social Security, Oil, Industries and Mines, Education, and Interior, as well as the head of the Management and Planning Organization (MPO) and the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).  Ahmadinejad has now made more changes to his Cabinet in one term than any other president of the Islamic Republic.  Many cabinet changes related to economy  ---------------------------------------  3.(S) Many of Ahmadinejad's cabinet changes have been related to the economic portfolio, and are likely intended to signal the president's renewed focus on improving the Iranian economy in advance of the 2009 presidential elections.  Ahmadinejad placed much of the blame for the failure of his economic policies on the former Economy Minister, Davoud Danesh-Jafari, who he fired in April.  The appointment of the new Economy Minister comes shortly after Ahmadinejad's announcement of his repackaged economic plan.  The new Minister of Economy, Shamseddin Hosseini, is regarded as a moderate, well-versed in economics, according to a Tehran-based economic analyst.  Tense debate over new Interior Minister  ---------------------------------------  4.(S) Despite the eventual vote of confidence for all three nominees, the debate over the Interior Minister candidate, Ali Kordan, was very contentious.  Kordan was reportedly one of Ahmadinejad's candidates to replace his original Oil Minister, Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, who resigned in August 2007.  Kordan was ultimately not nominated for the post of Oil Minister, but became Deputy Oil Minister.  According to one Iranian analyst, Kordan is widely believed to be an Ahmadinejad ally.  However, Kordan also formerly served as deputy head of state broadcasting under Majles Speaker Ali Larijani, and some reports suggest he is a Larijani ally.  5.(C) The question of whether Kordan is more closely allied with Ahmadinejad or Larijani could be important for next year's presidential elections, since the Interior Ministry is responsible for the voting process.  Rumors abound that Kordan's nomination was the result of an arranged compromise between Ahmadinejad and influential traditional conservatives, possibly including Expediency Council chair Rafsanjani, former Majles speaker Nateq-Nuri, and current Majles speaker Larijani.  Some observers point to the eventual approval of all three nominees as proof of the purported compromise.  6.(SBU) Despite the rumors of a bargain compromise, Kordan's nomination faced intense criticism from a variety of conservative MPs.  Kordan was accused of financial corruption  DUBAI 00000046  002.2 OF 002   during his tenure at the state broadcasting agency.  In addition, some hardline conservatives -- including Ruhollah Hosseinian, who claims to have been offered the Interior Minister post himself, but turned it down -- questioned Kordan's academic credentials, particularly his claim to have received an honorary PhD from Oxford University.  Conservative news website Alef reportedly queried Oxford about the claim and on Aug 6 published the purported response from Oxford saying it has no record of Kordan receiving a degree from the university.  During the Majles session, two prominent conservative MPs, Ahmad Tavakkoli and Elias Naderan, requested the debate on Kordan's credentials to be held in a closed session, but Majles Speaker Larijani -- Kordan's former boss at the state broadcasting agency -- denied the request.  In the end, 169 out of 271 MPs voted in favor of Kordan, but the unresolved questions about his credentials may weaken his position.  Ahmadinejad using the Supreme Leader's name for his purposes?  --------------------------------------------- ------  7.(SBU) Also at issue was the President's invocation of the Supreme Leader's name in his defense of his Cabinet nominees before the Majles.  Ahmadinejad announced to the Majles prior to the debate that Khamenei had given his approval of all three nominees, which may have affected the votes of a number of MPs. The Supreme Leader generally attempts to stay above the political fray in public, and Ahmadinejad's announcement of his support for the nominees was unusual.  8.(C) That bit of political theater provoked a strong response from the editorial page of the conservative daily Keyhan.  The paper's editor-in-chief Hossein Shariatmadari -- who was appointed by Khamenei -- accused Ahmadinejad of distorting and contradicting the words of the Supreme Leader.  Shariatmadari wrote, "Why has he [Ahmadinejad] used the Supreme Leader to achieve a political aim, let alone misquote him and distort his statements?"  It is unclear whether Ahmadinejad actually had Khamenei's support in this matter (the Keyhan editorial suggests otherwise), or perhaps gambled that he could present the Supreme Leader with a fait accompli.  What does this mean for Larijani and the Majles?  --------------------------------------------- ---  9.(C) In a 28 July editorial, moderate daily Kargozaran characterized the nomination debate as a test of the ability of the new 8th Majles -- under the leadership of Larijani -- to fulfill its supervisory role over the executive, and in effect, to stand up to the President.  The previous Majles, led by former Majles Speaker Haddad-Adel, was frequently criticized for its inability to stand up to Ahmadinejad, who occasionally bypassed the requirement of Majles approval on some government actions.  10.(C) Comment:  The rumors about the purported compromise between Ahmadinejad and traditional conservatives (possibly including Larijani) over Kordan's nomination make it difficult to assess whether the vote of approval for Kordan was good or bad for Larijani.  Given the contentious debate over Kordan's nomination, it was surprising however that the Majles under Larijani's leadership approved Ahmadinejad's nominee for Economy Minister without much debate, despite the widespread criticism of Ahmadinejad's economic policies.  The outcome of this nomination debate suggests that Larijani may have a difficult time marshaling the fractured conservatives in the 8th Majles, particularly in its efforts to enforce accountability from the Ahmadinejad government.  Separately, Ahmadinejad's use of the Supreme Leader's name to buttress his Cabinet nominations does not seem to have met with any repercussions, apart from the Keyhan editorial, and Ahmadinejad may feel emboldened to use this tactic again to enact his policies and perhaps to influence the 2009 presidential elections.  On this occasion, Ahmadinejad appears to have won the day. MADSEN 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000047  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/18/2018 TAGS: ECON, PGOV, PREL, IR SUBJECT: IRANIAN MERCHANT CLASS PREFERS POLITICAL STATUS QUO  DUBAI 00000047  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Amy Madsen, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(S) Summary:  The influence of the traditional Iranian merchant class, the bazaaris, remains unchanged in Iran, said one third-generation bazaari steel broker.  (Note: Throughout much of Iranian history, the bazaaris and the clergy have been mutually-reinforcing centers of economic and political influence. End note) The only difference, claimed the steel broker, is that the bazaaris have become disillusioned with the "mullahs" because they feel that the majority of the clerics are more interested in lining their own pockets than upholding ideological ideals.  Despite their collective disillusionment, the bazaaris are not at present interested in effecting change in the government, the steel broker alleged.  The last time the bazaaris helped to finance a revolution the outcome was not what they had hoped, he said, adding that while "every" bazaari knows the current system is "sick," no one wants to risk investing in a new system which could turn out to be worse for their interests.  Separately, the steel broker claimed the real estate market in Tehran has taken a down turn the last two months; this claim has not been substantiated by other sources.  End Summary.  Financial backers of the revolution  -------------------------------------------  2.(S) IRPoff met with a third-generation bazaari steel broker and seyyed August 13.  (Note: The term "seyyed" refers to a descendant of the Prophet Mohammad.  End note) According to this source, bazaari influence and relations with the clergy in Iran has not changed since the start of the revolution.  (Note: Throughout much of Iranian history, the bazaaris and the clergy have been mutually-reinforcing centers of economic and political influence.  Both groups played important roles in the Iranian constitutional revolution of 1905-1906, and bazaaris funded much of the activities of the clergy in support of the 1979 revolution.  End note) The steel broker alleged that that the bazaaris were the money behind the "mullahs who instigated the revolution."  (Note:  The steel broker repeatedly referred to members of the ruling clerical class using the somewhat pejorative term "mullahs."  End note) He said that his grandfather was instrumental to the revolution, providing money to the cause and publishing pamphlets about the goals of the revolution that were widely distributed in the bazaar.  The broker said that the bazaaris did not support the revolution for financial benefit.  He claimed that though the bazaaris enjoyed international access and prestige under the Shah's regime, they supported the revolution for ideological reasons.  3.(S) The steel broker claimed that since the revolution, the bazaaris have become disillusioned with the clergy and feel that the clerics place greater importance on lining their own pockets than governing according to religious ideology.  Describing the business relationship between the clerics and the bazaaris, he said that the clerics hold the import and export licenses, but that they need the bazaaris to move the money and the goods; this relationship has not changed over the past 30 years, claimed the broker.  No interest in changing the system  ----------------------------------------  4.(S) The bazaaris have no plans to try to effect change in the Iranian government or amongst the clerics, alleged the steel broker.  Despite widespread bazaari dissatisfaction with the Islamic Republic, which in the opinion of this particular trader is "sick," the bazaari class is afraid that any attempts to change the current system could make the situation worse.  The last time traders put their money behind a revolution, this was the case, he said.  The steel broker said that at least bazaaris know how to operate in the current system, it is one they understand and are invested in, he said.  However, echoing anecdotal comments of Iranian businesses writ-large, the steel trader complained of an increasingly difficult economic environment for Iran-based businesses; describing difficulties in financing imports and finding suitable trade partners.  Real Estate  ----------  5.(C) Separately, the steel broker claimed that real estate prices in Tehran have taken a down turn in the last two months.  DUBAI 00000047  002.2 OF 002   He alleged that investors are choosing to leave their money in the bank and live off the interest, as opposed to investing in Tehran's real estate market.  Additionally, the single source claimed that Iranian investments abroad, such as in Dubai, are on the rise.  6.(C)Comment:  IRPO does not have any information to substantiate the claim that real estate in Tehran is on the decline or that investments by Iranians in Dubai are on the rise.  This is the first source that has claimed a decline in the Tehran real estate market and this seems contrary to economic realities given that inflation is higher than interest rates.

REASON: 1.4 (d)  1. (U) Summary: Store owners in bazaars in Esfahan, Mashad, Tabriz, and Tehran shut down their businesses in early October to protest President Ahmedinejad's decision to levy a three percent value added tax, which was implemented on Sept 22. According to press reports, merchants feared that the increase of consumer products prices will lead to a decreased demand in an economy already plagued by 30 percent inflation.  In response, Ahmedinejad halted the implementation of the law by two months.  The government concession to the merchants is a move to placate a power base with traditional, but waning, ties to Iran's clerical structure and influence over internal politics.  End summary.  2. (U) The strike against the value added tax (VAT) started in Esfahan by gold merchants on October 4 and spread throughout the city.  The Iran daily newspaper Etemad reported that Esfahani store owners threatened to close their bank accounts, and pro-Khameini news agency, Yari, said the regime's special forces dispersed a silent demonstration of 500-1,000 merchants and closed the city centre to traffic.  On October 9, the protests spread to other Iranian cities, and on October 12, Tehran's market shut completely.  A leader of the National Guilds Association, Mohammad Azad, said `unknown persons' threatened to set fire to shops that did not shut down.  Merchants protested the levy for its lack of transparency and a further expansion of the underground economy.  One seller explained that a three percent tax levy translates to a 740,000 toman (USD 750) increase per kilogram of gold.  3. (U) The strike occurred during President Ahmedinejad's roll-out of his Economic Transformation Plan that he hopes will secure his re-election in 2009.  The director of the Iranian National Tax Administration (INTA) Ali-Akbar Arab Mazar said that the VAT will help curb money laundering and will fulfill one of the requirements of World Trade Organization membership. Analysts say, though, that the bazaari protest is a symbol of dissatisfaction with Ahmedinejad's recent economic policies, including gas rationing, the cessation of subsidies to manufacturers, and potential plans to cut energy subsidies.  One trader told a news agency, "We should not be happy with anything less than [the] collapse of [Mr.] Ahmadi-Nejad's government."  4. (U) Traditionally, the bazaaris have been seen as a political litmus test because of the merchants' close ties to the clergy. Some analysts say that Ahmedinejad's delayed implementation of the policy and directive to his finance minister to find a suitable action plan in collaboration with the unions means bazaaris have maintained a degree of influence over internal politics. An INTA statement indicates its desire to cooperate with the bazaaris, "the country's tax office hereby announces its readiness to offer the required facilities to implement the law in order to remove the concerns of the respected traders, organizing coordination meetings and providing training and information to the respected officials of the storekeepers' unions."  5. (C) Comment: These VAT protests are the first major strike by merchants since 1979, when they helped overthrow the Shah, and suggest that they still can mobilize and retain some political influence.  While Ahmadinejad's economic policies have been flawed, the scaling back of subsidies and efforts to improve tax revenue collection are actually long-overdue positive reforms. Entrenched interests have resisted such measures in the past, and the Iranian government had been reluctant to antagonize powerful consituencies with the inevitable upheaval they would create.  Ahmadinejad is continuing such measures, even in the face of such upheavals.  But it is important to distinguish protest against economic mismanagement, versus protest against the "transaction costs" of necessary economic reforms.  End comment.  ASGARD

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000049  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  10/23/2018 TAGS: PINR, PINS, PGOV, PREL, IR, IZ, ZP SUBJECT: FORMER IRANIAN RED CRESCENT OFFICIAL OUTLINES IRC'S AUXILIARY ROLE ASSISTING IRGC, MOIS  DUBAI 00000049  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (a), (b), (c), (d)    1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 18.  2. (S) Summary and Background: IRPO officer met with Dr. Farshid Towfighi on October 15 and 20, 2008 to discuss his career in the Iranian Red Crescent (IRC) and his knowledge of the IRC's assistance to Iran's Ministy of Information and Security (MOIS) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  Dr. Towfighi stated that, in addition to its standard relief role, the IRC has long served as an "auxiliary" force to support Iran's foreign policy goals.  The IRC's primary role as such appears to have been providing the MOIS and IRGC a means of funneling personnel abroad under humanitarian auspices and, more recently, aiding IRGC procurement.  President Ahmadi-Nejad's election in 2005 ultimately infused the IRC with a more hardline leadership.  Dr. Towfighi is an alumnus of a recent U.S. Government-sponsored exchange program facing IRIG persecution, apparently due to his participation in the exchange.  After fleeing Iran with his family in April 2008, he is in the UAE awaiting refugee processing.  While in UAE, Towfighi has met on several occasions with IRPO.  This message deals specifically with Towfighi's detailed knowledge of IRC's role in Iranian overseas security operations.  3. (C) Dr. Towfighi joined the IRC in 1983, following in the footsteps of his father, and remained there until 2008.  In 2007, Dr. Towfighi participated in a USG-sponsored crisis management exchange in the United States.  Following his return, his superiors at the IRC questioned his participation and eventually dismissed him.  The IRC took the unusual additional step of removing his publications on disaster relief operations from all 100-plus IRC offices nation-wide.  Towfighi challenged the IRC action in administrative proceedings, but eventually succumbed as continued IRC pressures made it difficult for Towfighi to pursue any gainful employment in Iran, placing his personal and financial security in jeopardy.  He later fled Iran and is now seeking resettlement in the United States.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has declared him a refugee and referred his case to the Department for resettlement.  End summary and background.  Longstanding IRC "Auxiliary" Role  ---------------------------------  4. (C) During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Dr. Towfighi stated Iran's military used ICR cover to enter Iraq and inspect Iranian prisoners of war held in Iraq.  Subsequently, in the Balkan war, the IRC provided cover to intelligence agents, provided weapons to militants, and actively sought to prevent true IRC employees from providing relief.  From 1997-2000 the IRC also provided support to Shia oppositionists in Bahrain and Yemen.  IRC Cover for Qods Force Officers in Iraq  -----------------------------------------  5. (S) In early 2003 Dr. Towfighi was the IRC's Director General for training and planning.  In this capacity, per the IRC's regulations, Dr. Towfighi signed the professional certificates for all IRC employees once they completed the necessary training.  Prior to the Iraq war, a Mr. Bothani - an MOIS representative stationed in the IRC-requested that Dr. Towfighi sign the professional certificate for two or three Qods Force officers, thus providing the necessary paperwork to travel to Iraq under IRC cover.  With the war underway, Dr. Towfighi says the number of Qods officers seeking IRC cover increased and was between ten and 30.  Dr. Towfighi resisted signing the paperwork (because doing so violated IRC policy), but it was then signed by his superior.  The only actual IRC officers in Iraq were the physicians and drivers.  6. (S) Dr. Towfighi was directed to travel to Iraq in roughly September 2003 to provide training for disaster relief to Iraq's fledgling government.  He arrived with another IRC employee, a Mr. Shoostarizadeh, who maintained ties to the Qods Force and "Hakim's forces in Iraq," likely meaning the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq's Abdul Aziz al-Hakim.  Dr.  DUBAI 00000049  002.2 OF 003   Towfighi noted the IRC also had ties with Muqtada al-Sadr.  In accompanying Mr. Shoostarizadeh around Iraq, Dr. Towfighi met many purported members of the IRC working in Iraq.  Dr. Towfighi knew none of the purported IRC members, and concluded that they were not legitimate IRC relief workers and alleged that someone else must have been signing their professional certificates. During his subsequent investigation by the MOIS-after attending the exchange in the US - Dr. Towfighi recalled being told that IRC identification cards had become more important after US forces had detained Iranian officers carrying IRGC identification cards.  7. (S) Dr. Towfighi returned to Iraq in March 2004 following the Karbala bombings to help Iranian victims of the blast.  He again met purported IRC officers that he assumed were Qods Force officers; at the time these officers were helping with the relief effort.  While in Karbala, Dr. Towfighi met with the IRGC commander in Karbala, who chastised Dr. Towfighi for not bringing a refrigerated transport vehicle to return victims' remains to Iran.  The commander then immediately authorized the purchase of such a vehicle at the cost of $40,000, surprising Dr. Towfighi that such money was readily available.  Dr. Towfighi traveled with three convoys of injured Iranians back to Iran, initially returning via the Qasr-e Shireen border crossing and then twice via Mehran.  During each trip, Dr. Towfighi indicated that militant groups with ties to Iran provided their security.  Ahmadi-Nejad's Election and the IRC  -----------------------------------  8. (S) Per the IRC's regulations, following his election in 2005, President Ahmadi-Nejad was able to appoint four members (out of 16) of the IRC management group.  These four (government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham, the Minister of Health, and two others) were opposed to the IRC's leadership and eventually requested its president, Dr. Ahmad Ali Noorbala, to resign. [Note: Dr. Noorbala participated in the 2007 US-Iran exchange program as well.]  He did so in January 2006 and was replaced with Dr. Masoud Khatami (a hardline former IRGC official - not related to former president Khatami).  Dr. Towfighi said Dr. Khatami had been president and a professor at Baqiyatollah University of Medical Sciences - an IRGC-run university.  Dr. Khatami's arrival coincided with an approximately year long effort to replace the entire management structure of the IRC. Nearly all Director Generals, Deputies, Office Heads, and Provincial Office Heads were replaced-totaling 200 headquarter managers and 300 provincial managers (out of 6000 staff members).  Most of the incoming managers were members of the IRGC or the MOIS.  Dr. Towfighi said that pre-existing members now considered the IRC an agent of the IRGC.  9. (S) Dr. Towfighi further elaborated on the presence of MOIS officials in the IRC and other government agencies.  All government agencies include an MOIS representative carrying the title of Deputy Director of Personnel and Document Protection; the aforementioned Mr. Bohthani held this position when he requested that Dr. Towfighi sign the paperwork for Qods force and MOIS officers.  Prior to Ahmadi-Nejad, the IRC official in this position was the sole MOIS representative; afterwards, Dr. Towfighi said 40 officers at headquarters and 100 officers at the provincial officers came from the MOIS.  10. (S) Dr. Khatami also required, in line with Ahmadinejad's government-wide directive, that all employees pass a counterintelligence course.  Dr. Towfighi indicated that such a course violated the principles of the IRC because Red Cross/Red Crescent organizations are supposed to be independent from the state.  11. (S) In addition to the personnel moves, Dr. Khatami has allowed the IRGC to assume roles traditionally assigned to the IRC, provided procurement support to the IRGC, and invested IRC funds in IRGC and Defense Ministry-backed companies.  The IRC under Dr. Noorbala had resisted the IRGC's request to take responsibility for relief and rescue operations.  With his departure, Dr. Khatami allowed the IRGC's Basij forces to assume responsibility for relief and rescue.  Dr. Khatami signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the IRGC, agreeing to provide the necessary rescue training and equipment, such as vehicles.  12.(S) In 2007, the IRC's budget was granted an additional $200 million to acquire helicopters. The IRC, via the company Navid  DUBAI 00000049  003.2 OF 003   Tak ordered 20 Russian MI-17 helicopters.  Five of these were delivered to the IRC, the remaining 15 went to the IRGC. A similar helicopter order was planned for 2008. (Note: Dr. Towfighi indicated that Navid Tak is the only Iranian entity allowed to import helicopters and that it is owned by the IRGC and MOIS.)  13.(S) Dr. Khatami has invested in three Iranian companies backed by the IRGC and Defense Ministry.  The first, owned by the Defense Ministry, produces chemical weapons protective equipment; it had been defunct prior to the infusion of IRC funds.  The second, owned by the IRGC, produces pre-fabricated military commands and mobile hospitals.  The third, owned by the Defense Ministry, produces armored personnel carriers.  14.(C) Finally, the IRC under Dr. Khatami began building health clinics in Karbala, Najaf, Hilla, Kazemayn, and Basra and awarded the construction contracts to IRGC companies, despite the IRC's own staff of qualified engineers.  Dr. Towfighi said the clinics would be used for treatment but also as warehouses for military equipment or military bases if needed.  He noted that the Iraqi Red Crescent and Iraqi Ministry of Health were not happy with this activity.  Facilitating IRGC Support to Hezbollah  --------------------------------------  15. (S) The IRC again facilitated the entry of Qods force officers to Lebanon during the Israel-Hezbollah war in summer 2006.  Although Dr. Towfighi did not travel to Lebanon during the conflict, he reiterated that the only true IRC officers dispatched to Lebanon were the doctors and drivers; all others were IRGC and MOIS officials.  Dr. Towfighi further said that the IRC shipments of medical supplies served also to facilitate weapons shipments.  He said that IRC drivers had seen missiles in the planes destined for Lebanon when delivering medical supplies to the plane.  The plane was allegedly "half full" prior to the arrival of any medical supplies.  16. (S) Dr. Khatami also allowed the transfer of an IRC hospital in southern Lebanon to Hezbollah.  Dr. Towfighi said that Hassan Nasrallah had asked Supreme Leader Khamenei to allow Hezbollah to run the hospital during Dr. Noorbala's tenure as IRC president.  Although Khamenei acquiesced, Dr. Noorbala prevented the transfer until his own departure.  The hospital still has an IRGC officer - a Dr. Adib - as its chief, but is under Hezbollah control.  Dr. Adib is allegedly close to Nasrallah and is also trying to create a network of medical clinics in Lebanon.  17. (S) Comment: Doctor Towfighi and Dr. Noorbala are examples of figures nominally within the Iranian government establishment who have taken courageous stands against IRGC and MOIS incursions into Iranian governance.  Such figures are key to our ability to understanding and countering the malign activities of these organizations regionally.  18. (S) Action request: The IRPO will continue dialogue with Dr. Towfighi.  His refugee processing with UNHCR in Abu Dhabi is proceeding well, but given the wide access Iran security agencies exercise towards Dubai-based Iranians, he and his family are probably vulnerable in the UAE. Given the value of Dr. Towfighi's information, and his status as an IVLP alumnus, IRPO Dubai requests guidance on whether there is any means to expedite his processing and settle him in the US as soon as possible.  If not, and standard refugee processing proceeds, IRPO requests authorization to issue a grant to fund research and reporting, and analysis off-site by Towfighi on matters within his professional experience.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)  1. (S) Summary: Hassan Fahs [strictly protect], former Al-Arabiyya bureau chief in Tehran, and Mazen Hayek, the Group Director of Marketing of Middle East Broadcasting Center, Al-Arabiyya's parent company, both attribute Fahs' recent expulsion from Iran to political motivations.  Fahs repeatedly declined overtures to cooperate with the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS) and was advised to leave soon after he fired suspected MOIS operatives at the bureau.  Hayek says Iranian authorities were specifically upset over Al-Arabiyya's allegedly biased coverage of Hizbollah and Hamas that compromised Iran's reputation.  The persecution of foreign journalists by Iranian authorities is becoming commonplace, and reflects the Iranian government's stringent efforts to control information into and out of Iran.  End Summary.  Al Arabiyya Tehran Bureau Chief Pays Price for Integrity  ============================================= ===========  2. (S) IRPO Director first met on 9/11 with Hassan Fahs, the former Al-Arabiyya bureau chief in Tehran who departed Iran abruptly the previous week after allegedly receiving threats from the Iranian government.  Fas had spent the past eight years in Iran, and outlined his experience.  Fas came to Iran in 2000 from his native Lebanon, where he hailed from a prominent Shia clerical family, and enrolled in graduate studies in journalism.  The Iranian MOIS first approached him at this time to forge a relationship, which he refused.  Later, Fahs sought to pursue a doctorate, and the MOIS contacted him again, and told him that continuing his studies was conditional on his cooperation.  He again refused, and was forced to abandon his doctoral studies. He continued to work in journalism and as a commentator on regional issues from Tehran with Al-Hayat, Al-Hurra and other media outlets.  3. (S) When he took over as Al-Arabiya's Tehran bureau chief, he surmised that three of his employees appeared to be working for Iranian intelligence.  One of these, he maintained, he recognized as a member of Lebanese Hizbollah.  After firing these suspected MOIS operatives, he noticed that his home and movements were being closely monitored, and he started to receive threatening calls. Then at a reception which included Iranian government staffers, a senior aide to President Ahmadinejad advised, "if I were you, I'd pack my bags and leave Iran."  Fahs listened and departed the next day.  4. (S) During our first discussion, Fahs appeared in fair spirits, despite the harrowing circumstances of his situation. He had come to Dubai with his daughter, and was on his way to Lebanon to leave her there with his family. He was concerned, though, that he might be targeted by Hizbollah when he returned to Beirut.   When we spoke a few weeks later, Fas was still working on getting his wife and other child out of Iran.  While in Dubai, Fas met with Dubai-based Al-Arabiyya management to discuss his situation.  According to media sources, Fas will continue to work for Al Arabiyya, possibly with his own program broadcast from Dubai.  Fas is scheduled to return from Lebanon on October 28 and IRPO will follow up then.  MBC Facing Iranian Backlash on Al Arabiyya Coverage  ============================================= ======  5. (C) On 9/14, IRPoffs met with Mazen Hayek, Group Director of Marketing al Al-Arabiya's parent, Middle East Broadcasting (MBC), who told us Fahs' expulsion from the station's Al-Arabiyya bureau in Tehran was "politically motivated. " He cited Iran's accusation that the station unfairly covered Iran's role in Hamas and Hizbollah activities.  Iran does not have a specific grievance with Fahs, a seasoned journalist and the son of a Shi'a cleric. Rather, Hayek said, Iran was critical of Al-Arabiya's coverage of "Al-Mughniyya, Hamas, Hizbollah, and Iraq."  Hayek said that Iran was sending a clear message to Saudi-owned MBC that "don't play with us anymore; we know what you are doing."   Hayek said MBC had no immediate plans to replace Fahs in Tehran and would wait to see if tensions subsided before making a decision.  6. (C) Hayek's enthusiasm for MBC's activities in Iran, including the launch of the new satellite movie channel MBC Persian, has waned compared to our previous meetings with him in light of these recent developments.  MBC has not received any  DUBAI 00000051  002.117 OF 002   indication that Iran will try to close the Al Arabiyya bureau in Tehran or pressure the UAE government to halt its broadcasts into Iran.  But Hayek, a Lebanese citizen who often steers discussions toward his native country and Iranian support for Hizbollah and Hamas, speculated that MBC could suffer more backlashes from the Iranian government.  He said that an Al-Arabiyya correspondent in Iraq was targeted in a foiled roadside bomb plot (NFI), and said MBC and Al Arabiya staff in Beirut had recently been warned to be vigilant against possible Hizbollah or Iranian action.  Iranian Redlines on Foreign Media Nothing New  =============================================  7. (C) Fahs' expulsion is not the first time Iran has criticized foreign media outlets.  A 2004 article from Tehran Times, "Al-Jazeera's Psyops," berates the station for being a "Zionist agent" that tries to "divide Islamic countries and tarnish the image of Islam."  The article responded harshly to a political cartoon by the network of a cleric who dismisses various problems of the Muslim world, but reacts forcefully to the term "Arab Gulf" over the preferred "Persian Gulf."  In April 2005, Iran shut down Al-Jazeera's bureau in Iran for fourteen months after allegations that the station's coverage of clashes in the southwestern oil city of Ahvaz incited further violence. Similarly, in July 2008, Iranian authorities refused to renew the visa of the Iran deputy bureau chief of Agence France Presse, Stuart Williams.  8. (U) Some politicians have appealed to parliament to take swift action against any media outlet that criticizes the country, perceiving it as improper journalistic conduct. Opponents to foreign outlets appear to conflate criticism on Iran's policies with an attack against Islam.  According to Iranian press, a member of the parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, Javad Jahangirzadah, exhorted the Ministry of Culture to respond to Al-Arabiyya: "Our entire national and international dignity, symbolized by the Imam Khomeini, is not meant to be attacked by a news report while we give a mild response.  The issue right now is why have state bodies remained silent in the face of Al-Arabiyya's violation?"  9. (C) Iran has responded to foreign media outlets by serving its domestic market its own state-run entertainment channels.  A month after the launch of MBC Persian, which broadcasts American movies with Persian subtitles via satellite, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) announced its launch of an independent around-the-clock network dedicated to movies subtitled in Arabic for audiences around the region. Similarly, Star TV's Sanjay Das told IRPOff that his company's market research found half-cooked attempts by IRIB channels to imitate popular games and talk shows to counter the original version exported from abroad.  IRIB's new programs are part of its five-year plan to produce more domestic and international channels, according to Iranian Press.  10. (C) Comment: Despite Iran's best efforts, the government cannot stem media interest in Iran, indicated by foreign media outlets continued interest in the country.  Hayek described the appeal of Iran's TV market as its large and influential youth population, almost 30 million strong.  Furthermore, Hayek said, the satellite market can only stand to grow, not diminish.  IRIB predicts that 23 million people have uncontrolled access to satellite channels and this number will most likely grow.  The market potential appeals to media companies that seek to leverage the demand for entertainment not met by the state-controlled IRIB.  Meanwhile, the recent events with Al-Arabiya staff in Iran suggest that the current Iranian regime is aware of its vulnerability to outside influences and objective news reporting.  IRPO believes that Fahs' expulsion is one indicator that the government is nervous about fissures in its ability to control the flow of information in and out of Iran.ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary:  IRPO Officer met on October 29 with an Iranian Baha'i family to discuss the conditions facing Baha'is in Iran. The family confirmed existing reporting regarding the persecution Baha'is face and provided detail into how the IRIG tracks the Baha'i population, operations of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education, attitudes of Baha'i youth, and the Baha'is' assimilation into Persian society.  Iranian Baha'is continue to be persecuted in Iran, facing restrictions on practicing their religion, finding employment, and pursuing an education.  End summary.  2. (C) The family reiterated that conditions in Iran for Baha'is are very difficult; Baha'is cannot freely practice their religion, are unable to attend universities in Iran, cannot work for the government, and cannot receive a pension.  Additionally, the IRIG bars Baha'is from employment in certain private sectors, such as barber shops or groceries, because Baha'is are considered unclean. The father of the family has a construction company.  The family indicated that they feel daily pressure from the government, but this appears to stem from the general circumstances facing Baha'is rather than daily IRIG harassment.  3. (C) However, the family reported that the government does monitor the Baha'i population closely.  When entering primary and secondary school, all children are required to disclose their religion on the entrance forms and provide the identities and addresses of their extended family members.  In the case of Baha'i students, the family detail is passed on to the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS).  The family also indicated that the MOIS will send representatives to observe Baha'is when they are gathering with non-Baha'is.  The father recalled being at a funeral when a friend of his pointed out a purported MOIS observer.  Although Baha'is are not blocked from socializing with non-Baha'is, the family said the MOIS will question non-Baha'is about their association with Baha'is.  Finally, per a government decree, Baha'is, when gathering with other Baha'is, may not do so in groups greater than 20.  4. (U) Until "several" years ago, the family indicated that the IRIG held their passports, preventing them from traveling outside of the country.  Although the family does not know why the IRIG reversed policy, they have heard that the IRIG now wanted Baha'is to leave the country and not return.  5. (C) The family's daughter attends the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education (BIHE) in Iran.  (Background: According to the school's website, Baha'is founded the school in 1987 to provide their community with access to higher education.  The IRIG knows about the school but apparently turns a blind eye to it.  The family did not know why it was allowed to operate.)  According to the daughter, the school has approximately 2,500 students from all over Iran.  It is a 4-year program with classes in 14 different fields.  Classes meet daily online, and she also travels to Tehran 3-4 times per semester for classes with her classmates.  All classes have less than 20 students to comply with the aforementioned IRIG decree.  The university degree is not valid in Iran, but according to the family, it is accepted by some Western universities. The daughter indicated that many young Baha'is want to pursue advanced degrees in Western universities.  Her father interjected that after doing so, most want to return to Iran and help educate Iranians.  He noted that most Iranian schools are not very good and the Baha'i community wants to help improve the education system.  6. (C) When asked why they stay in Iran, the family responded that their religion was founded in Iran and that they love Iran.  The family said they liked other Iranians, including non-Baha'is, and are socially engaged in mixed groups.  The daughter, for example, sings in a choir that includes Muslims and Baha'is.  The family said non-governmental Iranians do not dislike Bahai's and tend to disregard IRIG anti-Baha'i propaganda.  7. (C) The family deemed IRIG accusations that Nobel Peace Prize laureate and lawyer Shirin Ebadi's daughter is Baha'i to be completely false (The allegations were made in government-owned media sources and conservative newspapers).  They said the accusations were a bid to tarnish Ebadi's reputation because she is defending seven imprisoned members of the Baha'i leadership. The families' comments are consistent with Ebadi's; according to the family, few in Iran believe the claims.   DUBAI 00000052  002.2 OF 002   8. (C) Comment: The family provided welcome insight into their daily lives in Iran.  Although Baha'is face persecution in Iran, and the rigors of living in Iran as a Baha'i was clear from their comments, they spoke passionately about Iran and were optimistic that conditions would eventually improve even while noting greater difficulties after President Ahmadinejad's 2005 election.  The family as a whole was very open to IRPO officer's questions and seemed to support greater USG action on behalf of the Iranian Baha'is. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (S) IRPO Director met on November 6 with Ambassador Gholamali Khoshroo (retired), who was in Dubai applying for a visa to attend the NYU Center for Dialogues Iran Conference in early December.  Ambassador Khoshroo's scheduled presentation will address opportunities for US-Iran cooperation.  Khosroo's last assignment before his retirement was as Iranian Ambassador to Australia.  He has also served in the Iranian Permanent Representatives' Mission to the UN.  Meeting just after the US election, Khosroo was cautiously optimistic about possibly improved US-Iran relations, and welcomed the prospect of renewed US influence in the region, with the proviso that it relies less on the use of military force and more on America's "essential" qualities.  A senior advisor to former President Khatami, he noted Khatami was under intense pressure to run, and that the new US administration's approach to Iran might have an impact on the viability of Khatami's candidacy.  End summary.  2. (S) Speaking immediately after the US presidential election, the discussion began with remarks on the US election.  First, Khosroo voiced his congratulations for the democratic ideals the election demonstrated.  Khosroo was positive about prospects for improved US-Iran relations in the future, but warned against proceeding too quickly.  It was advisable to work gradually and with great transparency given the long period of mistrust.  He noted that many Iranians, including the government, remained concerned that at any moment a war could begin - addressing this fear might be a good place to start.  3. (S) Khosroo spoke quite highly of the US, having served there as a diplomat.  He had a daughter who was born in the US and a son who had studied and worked there.  He recalled that he was in Australia and attended an event to show sympathy after the 9/11 tragedy.  At this event he spoke highly of the US and passed along his condolences directly to the US Ambassador.  In an additional aside about the US election, Khosroo told IRPOff that in his view, immediate post-election America now enjoys broad global support, much like she did immediately after 9/11.  4. (S) In elaborating on his sense of America's potential to regain its standing in the region, Khosroo was critical of US "unilateralism and force", and suggested that these were not the best tools to spread US influence.  Rather, the US could gain international support through relying on its "essential qualities" of freedom, economic opportunity, technological innovation, tolerance and equality.  In an effort to personalize his views, he detailed the recent experiences of his son, who had graduated from law school in Iran, traveled to New York to pursue graduate level law study, passed the NY bar and secured a position with a major NY law firm - all in less than 2 years. Khosroo compared this to his son's likely fate inside Iran, telling IRPOff that "you can not imagine how much would be required to get even a well-qualified, well-connected person like my son a decent job."  America had extended this opportunity, he added, "even to a citizen of a country it considers an enemy!"  5. (S) Khosroo served as a senior diplomat during Khatami's administration, and remains a close confidante of the former president on foreign policy matters.  Khosroo's continuing ties to Khatami are reportedly what led to his dismissal from the Foreign Ministry during Ahmadinejad's presidency.  Khosroo noted that during Khatami's administration the MFA had worked to support Khatami's initiatives towards reconciliation with the West, including the US.  Pausing to reflect, Khosroo added that "perhaps we moved too quickly then."  6. (S) In response to IRPO Director's question on former President Khatami's plans, Khosroo said that Khatami is reluctant to again take on demands of the presidency, but that he is under heavy pressure to run.  If he does run, Khosroo predicted, he will again get 70 to 75 percent of the vote.  For his own sake, Khosroo said, he would personally prefer Khatami did not run again, as it would mean he and other Khatami allies would have to return to the chaotic world of Iranian politics. Khosroo was somber, but focused throughout the discussion. Based upon his tone and expression, it appeared he clearly envisioned the demands the next election would place on Khatami and his allies, but that he would be willing to answer the call if needed.  In conclusion, Khosroo noted, the results of the recent US election might have made Khatami's decision easier.   DUBAI 00000053  002.2 OF 002   7. (S) Comment: Khosroo represents a core, found throughout the Iranian government, of senior officials favorably disposed towards the US.  This group varies in levels of support for US policies, but most harbor positive feelings towards American culture, technological and academic prowess, and Americans as a people.  Many have lived or studied in the US for extended periods, and some even have US citizen children.  These figures include, among others, government officials like First Vice President Parviz Davoudi, Former Permrep Javad Zarif, and prominent Freedom Movement leader Ibrahim Yazdi.  8. (S) Comment, continued: Khosroo's comments regarding Khatami's potential return to the presidency corroborate the view that the Islamic Republic tends to produce (and the Supreme Leader promote) a President suited to the anticipated challenges and strategic environment Iran will face over the next 5-10 years.  The implication, which Khosroo alludes to in his final comment about Khatami's choice being easier under a new US administration, is that a perceived future confrontational international environment will reinforce the Leader's promotion of and popular support for a national security hardliner (viz,. a second Ahmadinejad term), whereas the perception of future ditente may set the stage for more moderate Iranian leadership (viz., the return of Khatami).

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary: In a November 8 meeting with IRPOffs, Tehran Associated Press Television News (APTN) senior producer Reza Ganji detailed the AP's continuing efforts to maintain a foothold for American journalism inside Iran, challenges it faces in Iran's tense media environment, and some views about Iranian perceptions towards foreign media based upon discussions with senior officials.  In addition, Ganji offered some suggestions regarding means to increase journalist access into Iran, including possible journalism exchanges.  End summary.  2. (C) Reza Ganji, AP TV News Tehran Senior Producer told IRPOffs that the Iranian government continues to allow AP's presence in Tehran and good access to a range of contacts inside the government.  It has not censored or interfered with AP reporting.  The AP office has sections covering news, sports, entertainment, and other areas.  The Tehran office now serves as the main source of wire information on Iran, including for VOA, particularly since CNN and other major networks ended their contracts with Reuters a few weeks ago.  In addition, Ganji noted, he assists other US media outlets like ABC and Fox with their reporting out of Iran.  Given AP's importance as an American news outlet in Iran - and its vulnerability to potential Iranian retaliation over U.S. prohibitions on Iranian journalists - Ganji urged USG to support its continuing viability.  In brief, Ganji called for improving the level of journalistic exchange and access between the US and Iran.  3. (C) Ganji did not seem to be aware in any detailed way about the recent difficulties faced by the International War and Peace Reporting journalists, whose well-coordinated exchange program was cancelled at the very last moment by Iranian security officials who forbid their participation.  Alluding to such challenges, IRPOff noted that while the IRIG claimed at senior levels that it supported exchanges, operationally it complicated and in some cases wholly blocked several recent programs.  Ganji replied this was due to lingering concerns and paranoia over foreign intrigues.  He added, "It's not so unreasonable they'd be nervous with US forces on their borders and throughout the region."  The best way to reduce such paranoia, Ganji suggested, was to encourage information flow.  Enhancing journalist access in both directions would offer benefits along these lines.  4. (C) Ganji suggested that many of the problems impacting bilateral relations could be attributed to poor administration within the Iranian government.  As an example, he cited the last-minute request by the IRIG to add ten journalists to President Ahmadinejad's 2008 UNGA delegation.  Ganji's contacts inside the government complained about the perceived US slight when these journalists' visas were "refused."  Ganji told IRPOffs he replied forcefully to these complaints telling Iranian officials that "knowing how you operate, you probably turned in the visa applications at the last minute, and then expected everything to work out."  He claimed to have also told them that prompt and courteous visa service (or for that matter support of human rights of journalists - foreign or domestic) - was not an IRIG strength.  Whether Ganji is actually so assertive with IRIG officials is hard to tell, but his jocular recounting of these incidents suggest he may have sprinkled a share of humor into his admonishment.  5. (C) On the journalism exchange programs, Ganji noted that, even with the difficulties encountered by recent exchange programs, he would like to organize an exchange program with Iranian media representatives traveling to the US.  Ganji also discussed with IRPOffs the possibility of sending a US journalism professor and a prominent journalist (print or broadcast) to Iran to visit various university journalism departments to conduct workshops.  6. (C) Comment: The AP's ability to report relatively freely from Iran and the continued access of many Iranians to satellite broadcasts and the internet suggests that information is continuing to flow in and out of Iran at a level beyond what the IRIG can control.  We can encourage this positive trend through tactful support of current private media operations.  Ganji's suggestion of American media professionals visiting Iran to conduct journalism workshops is an intriguing possibility.  In addition to assisting in opening media breathing room for AP and  DUBAI 00000054  002.2 OF 002   other foreign outlets to operate, it can start professionalizing Iranian journalism.  Finally, as many contacts have suggested, sending exchange visitors to Iran may help overcome lingering IRIG suspicions about exchanges in general. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.  (C) Expediency Council Chairman Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani gave an unusual speech at Sharif University on November 23 in which he acknowledged several "mistakes" that had occurred during the early period of the Islamic Revolution, including the siege of the American Embassy, and announced that it was now possible to criticize these mistakes.  Rafsanjani explicitly noted that he did not have any foreknowledge of the Embassy takeover, and went so far as to point out that both he and (now-Supreme Leader) Ali Khamenei were in Mecca together when they learned of the siege from radio reports.  A former IRIG official noted to IRPO Poloff that this is the first time he has heard a member of the senior leadership in Iran criticize the attack on the Embassy.  According to the source, this break with thirty years of public defense of the embassy siege could signal that Rafsanjani is trying to lay the foundation for a thaw in relations between Iran and the United States.  2.  (SBU) During his address to the "Thirty Years of Islamic Revolution Congress," Rafsanjani went on to regret that many university professors had been purged during the early years of the Revolution.  He furthered cautioned that "elites" in Iran should not be marginalized by contemporary politicians, and argued that their participation in the upcoming election is an important element to building a secure future for the Islamic Republic.  3. (C) Comment: Despite Rafsanjani's use of standard revolutionary language in the speech -he referred to the American Embassy as "the nest of spies" - the acknowledgement that the act itself was a mistake is notable.  By pointing out that neither he nor Khamenei had any advance knowledge of the attack, and that they were outside of Iran at the time and therefore could not have participated in the decision-making process that led then-Supreme Leader Khomeini to sanction the siege after the fact, Rafsanjani is overtly distancing both himself and the Supreme Leader from the event that led to the rupture of relations between Iran and the United States.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (c), (d)    1. (S/NF) Summary:  Two UN officials based in Tehran, in separate conversations with IRPO officers, said that officials in Iran's Ministry of Interior are willing to work with the United States on issues relating to Afghanistan within a United Nations framework.  Specifically, they noted that the IRIG is seeking cooperation and assistance to address the problems of refugees/economic migrants from Afghanistan and combating the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan.  Both men pointed to Deputy Minister of Interior Abbas Mohtaj as the likely IRIG lead on any such initiative.  End summary.  Refugees and Counter Narcotics: Potential Areas for Technical Cooperation  2. (S/NF) During a November 18 meeting with IRPO officers, Tehran-based UNHCR official Amir Barmaki (strictly protect) described counter-narcotics and refugees as areas ripe for cooperation between Iran and the United States.  [Note: The IRPO initially learned of Barmaki's interest in serving as a source of information via London Iran Watcher.]  According to Barmaki, there is strong support within the Ministry of Interior for a joint and pragmatic approach to address problems emanating from Afghanistan.  Barmaki argued that elements within the IRIG, particularly at the sub-ministerial and working levels, would be comfortable working with the USG under the UN umbrella.  In a separate conversation, Bruce Koepke (strictly protect), the UNAMA liaison officer in Tehran, agreed with Barmaki's assessment.  Koepke said that Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed interest to UNODC staff in Iran about working multilaterally, including with the US and the UK, to combat the production of drugs in Afghanistan as well as drug trafficking to/through Iran.  3. (S/NF) Barmaki said that any contribution on the part of the United States toward easing the societal and economic burdens the instability in Afghanistan places on Iran would be well received by both the people and the government of Iran. Iranians, in his estimation, feel that their assistance to Afghan refugees over the decades of war in that country has been unappreciated by the international community in general and the US in particular.  Barmaki also argued that explicit and tangible contributions to refugee assistance, above and beyond our contributions to UNHCR, would help undermine IRIG officials' attempts to portray USG actions in the region as inhumane. Barmaki cited increasing negative domestic press coverage of the effects on Iran caused by the "reverse flow" of economic migrants from Afghanistan to Iran.  At the same time, Barmaki cautioned against the USG publicly trying to take credit for its assistance, as publicity could backfire by causing MOI officials to back away.  4. (S/NF) Both Barmaki and Koepke separately pointed to Deputy Ministry of Interior for Security and Disciplinary Affairs Abbas Mohtaj as a potential interlocutor for both counter-narcotics and refugee issues.  Barmaki said that Mohtaj is actually an "intelligence officer" and is therefore able to "get many things done."  Koepke noted that Mohtaj is known as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue and has a solid working relationship with the UN in Iran.  5. (S/NF) Koepke believes that just within the past couple of months, members of Tehran's political elite who favor cooperation with the West on Afghanistan have become noticeably emboldened.  He pointed to a series of think tank events in Tehran this fall in which people such as Iran's former UN Ambassador Javad Zarif had given lectures arguing that Iran should reengage with international efforts to find a political solution for Afghanistan.  While acknowledging that invitation-only discussions held in think tanks and research centers affiliated with state institutions hardly signals a sea change in official thinking, Koepke argued forcefully that just a few months ago such events would have been unthinkable.  6. (S/NF) In a separate discussion with AIC president Hooshang Amirahmadi in early November, IRPO first heard that the Iranian  DUBAI 00000056  002.2 OF 002   government - in this case again it was the Ministry of Interior - was keenly interested in counternarcotics cooperation with the US.  Following up above via two separate UN agency officials based in Iran, we are now confident that this interest is genuine, although we can not ascribe IRIG motivations. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1. (C) Summary:  Tehran Deputy Mayor and head of Tehran's Urban Beautification Organization Hojatollah Mollasalehi told us in a brief meeting on December 18 that Tehran Mayor Qalibaf had not decided whether to run for president or not. Qalibaf's decision would depend on the prospects of President Ahmadinejad's re-election.  He said Ahmadinejad's hopes, in turn, hinge on USG actions. Mollasalehi also discussed Tehran's finances and Qalibaf's tenure as mayor. End Summary.  2. (C) IRPO officer on December 18 met briefly with Tehran Deputy Mayor Hojatollah Mollasalehi in Dubai.  Mollasalehi has applied for a visa to travel to the U.S. to visit family. Mollasalehi was friendly and willing to discuss matters, but did not directly answer questions, particularly regarding Qalibaf.  Qalibaf Bides His Time  ----------------------  3. (C) Mollasalehi said Qalibaf's participation in the presidential election depends on the situation and then assessed that President Ahmadinejad's re-election hopes hinge on USG actions.  Mollasalehi indicated that Ahmadinejad could win re-election if either ties between the IRIG and the USG improve, which would allow Ahmadinejad to take credit, or if the USG takes more aggressive action against Iran, prompting Iranians to rally around the president. When asked if the Iranian people would actually credit Ahmadinejad for improved Iran-USG ties, he responded that the educated people would not, but many others would.  Tehran's Expanding Budget  -------------------------  4. (C) Mollasalehi, one of several Deputy Mayors, joined the Tehran Municipality two months after Qalibaf became Mayor in 2005.  He has since then headed the Urban Beautification Organization, which has assumed more importance under Mayor Qalibaf.  Mollasalehi said the organization's budget has increased from USD 10 million under President Ahmadinejad, the former mayor, to USD 400 million.  He said the beautification program is quite popular among Tehran's residents.  5. (C) Tehran's broader budget has also expanded under Qalibaf, according to Mollasalehi.  He said the budget had previously been USD 1.4 billion dollars and is now several times that size. When asked how the city was able to raise more money, he responded that the city now has better management.  He explained that the city has three sources of revenue, selling building permits for the construction of new buildings, selling advertising space, and taxes.  (Comment:  Mollasalehi did not break down what percentage each of these sources contribute to the overall budget, but Tehran in the past few years has experienced a real estate and construction boom, which presumably also figures prominently in Tehran's burgeoning budget).  6. (C) Mollasalehi indicated that Tehran does not receive any support from the central government the relationship between Ahmadinejad and Qalibaf remains poor.  When asked if Tehran received support from the central government during the Khatami presidency, he noted that the relationship between Khatami and Ahmadinejad had also been adversarial.    7. (C) Comment:  Mollasaheli's contention that Ahmadinejad now finds himself in the ironic position of depending on USG action to assure his re-election is one other IRPO contacts have made recently.  We have also heard that Qalibaf is not a favorite of Ayatollah Khamenei, and he may be hesitant to publicly express his candidacy without some sign from the Supreme Leader. Nevertheless, Qalibaf has solid support and popularity in Tehran, and as the city's increasing budget shows, has established himself as an able politician and administrator. End comment.  ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [U] This January 20, 2009 edition of Window on Iran was sent out on that date via classified e-mail.    2. [S/NF] Up Against Twenty Billion Dollars of Support, Reformists Wary of AN Fraud: According to a Tehran and Dubai-Iranian businessman close to reformist presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi, the IRIG Central Bank has printed $20 billion (200 trillion rials) in alternative currency he called "check money" to support President Ahmadinejad's economic reforms and election prospects.  Former Central Bank Governor Mazaheri was reportedly fired because he refused to conduct this project.  While this funding stream and AN's access to forex reserves (WOI, 1/13/09) were secret, Supreme Leader Khamenei publicly confirmed his support in a letter to the president, which was published in full in several newspapers, outlining his guidance for Ahmadinejad for execution of the 6th Five Year Plan.  Finally, he said that the IRIG had published four million blank identity documents (shenasnameha) to distribute to loyal Basij and pro-AN forces to ensure an AN victory, and showed IRPOff a copy of one such blank shenasname.  This businessman noted that the Supreme Leader has never shown such total support of a candidate before, and that AN's position is now very strong.  Under these conditions, defeating AN, however, would mean a huge defeat of the core power centers of the IRIG.  With this in mind, he noted that both Karroubi and Khatami, who are both aware he meets with foreign officials, had asked him to pass on their interest in having UN observers present during June's elections.    3. [C/NF] While AN Still the Favorite; Khatami and Mousavi Both Eying Run: Multiple IRPO contacts report AN continues to enjoy strong backing from the Supreme Leader, but powerful rivals now seem  likely to challenge him from the left.  Former President Khatami reportedly held his long-awaited meeting with the Supreme Leader a few days ago to discuss his candidacy, at which Khamenei reportedly told him he "does not oppose any qualified candidate from running."  As for Former PM Mousavi, he has reportedly told Hashemi Rafsanjani he is serious about running, and Rafsanjani pledged to support him if he does.  Sources inside the SNSC reportedly dismiss Mousavi as "essentially a Communist who thinks the state should run everything."  Comment: According to well-placed sources, Mousavi and Khatami have long-running differences stemming from conflict in the early days of the Islamic Republic.  Khatami and Mousavi may be coordinating their candidacies, possibly with Rafsanjani's help.  Faced with two popular candidates on the left, Khamenei and the Guardian Council may opt to choose the lesser of two evils.  In our estimation, this would be the centrist cleric Khatami over the leftist layman Mousavi.  This would set the stage for a deeply polarizing election between Ahmadinejad and Khatami, which would actually represent a proxy showdown between arch-rivals and regime pillars Khamenei and Rafsanjani for the future direction of the Islamic Republic.    4. [S/NF] Islamic Azad University Willing To Work with IRPO, May Change Leadership: Senior officials of Islamic Azad University, Iran's largest private university, have indicated they are willing to work with IRPO on academic exchanges and other public diplomacy programming.  Azad, with over 70 campuses including one in Dubai, is currently headed by Assadollah Jasbi, but one well-placed IRPO source noted that former FM Ali Velayati may soon take over Azad's leadership.  Note: The Islamic Azad University was founded in 1985 by Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose son has directly voiced his strong support for proposed US-Iran academic programming to IRPO contact.    5. [C/NF]  Iranian Visa Applicants Consistently Tune in to Voice of America: Dubai IRPO Conoff in late 2008 asked Iranian visa applicants about their television news sources. A significant majority of the applicants reported that they watched foreign news broadcasts for international news. Some even watch foreign broadcasts for domestic news as well.   Applicants repeatedly mentioned Voice of America (VOA) as their primary source, although applicants also mentioned CNN, BBC, and Iran's state-owned television channels. A retired female employee of the National Iranian Oil company said that she watches VOA because it is honest, a point echoed by several other visa applicants.  The applicants were also unconcerned that satellite  DUBAI 00000046  002.2 OF 002   dishes are illegal; some, with great delight, explained how they hid their dishes.  Comment:  The Iranian visa applicants as a whole are a wealthier and more Western-oriented segment of the population; their viewing habits may not be representative of the broader population.  Although some applicants many have named VOA to curry favor during the interview, applicants at times mentioned the specific shows they like.    6. [S/NF] MOIS Has Official List of Hostage-Takers:  According to an Iranian-American businessman with close ties to IRIG officials, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security has a list of the people involved in the November 1979 siege of the American Embassy in Tehran.  The IRPO source stated that in response to a specific inquiry about the role of an Iranian individual in the hostage crisis, a senior MOIS's representative to the Supreme National Security Council, offered to check "the list. "   The IRPO source believes the list compiled by MOIS includes only those persons who planned, executed, and remained actively involved in the embassy takeover.  Those participating in the many demonstrations in the Embassy vicinity were not included.    7. [S/NF] Iran Convicts Alaei Brothers on Espionage Charges, Implicates IRPO and Others in "Soft Overthrow" Plot: Our contacts have offered various interpretations of the conviction of Arash and Kamyar Alaei and two unnamed others for espionage, and the subsequent claims of an Iranian intelligence official that exchange programs are a cover for U.S.-orchestrated regime change project geared towards fomenting "soft overthrow" in Iran.  One well-placed source told us that the Senior MOIS believed National Academy of Sciences official Glen Schweitzer was the ringleader for the four-person spying ring, which was allegedly probing the inner workings of the Majles (among their many other alleged activities, apparently.  The MOIS also had believed the Alaeis were establishing anti-government networks within the country, he said.  Other contacts were more inclined to think the claims of a U.S. spy ring were the result of Iranian paranoia or a broader government effort to control or suppress civil society before Iranian presidential elections rather than any actual evidence in MOIS hands.  Comment: The intelligence official's press statement indicated that Iranian intelligence services know much about our exchange programs, information easily obtained from press reports or questioning past participants.  How MOIS concocted its elaborate theory regarding their impact, is harder to discern.  It appears to us that these latest allegations are more likely a last rebuke to the Bush Administration and a marker laid down for the new Obama Administration rather than a blanket prohibition on further exchanges.    8.

[S/NF] Russians Offer Iran Security Inducements to Shun US Negotiations: According to a former Guardian Council member and as corroborated by a former IRGC general, Russia has reportedly offered Iran major incentives not to enter negotiations with the US aimed at defusing bilateral tensions.  One major element of these incentives is reportedly providing Iran the advanced S-300 antiaircraft system.  Comment: Russia's "counter-package" is likely meant to encourage Iran to resist any temptation to accept the P5+1 incentives package.  If accurate, this measure entails Russia actively undermining the P5+1 bargaining position and seeking to dissuade any Iranian security accommodation with the US.    3. [S/NF] Supreme Leader Taking Cautious Steps Towards US-Iran Reconciliation: Reportedly encouraged by the prospect of a new US approach to Iran by the incoming US administration, Supreme Leader Khamenei is taking careful, but important steps towards laying the foundation for improved ties, say three well-placed Iranians.  First, he has reportedly tapped his highly influential son, Mojtabah, to head a commission run out of the Supreme Leader's Office to explore possible steps towards relations with the US.  Second, Khamenei has reportedly ordered all current occupants [thought to be mostly IRGC] of the former US Embassy in Tehran to vacate the premises.  Comment: While plans for the US Embassy are perennial grist for rumor, a high-level commission within the SL's office run through Mojtabah corroborates other reporting indicating Mojtabah's central role as the primary gatekeeper to his father and indicates the importance the SL assigns to direct control of this issue.  Other key figures reportedly charged with advising the SL on US-Iran relations are Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani (SG of the Combatant Clergy Association and president of the influential Imam Sadiq University), Brigadier General Mohammad Hejazi (a senior IRGC official serving in a liaison capacity with the SL's office), and Hashemi Rafsanjani.    4. [S/NF] Khamenei Offers AN Full Support, Rival Principalists Condition Theirs: According to a former Guardian Council member, after a period of intense pre-election consultations among regime insiders, Supreme Leader Khamenei has reportedly decided to lend his full support to Ahmadinejad's reelection.  To bolster AN's chances, Khamenei has reportedly told AN he may tap into Iran's foreign exchange reserves for funds as needed.  If the Majles objects, the SL has pledged to wield his status as velayat-e faqih to quash any dissent.  Rival Principalists have meanwhile conditioned their support for AN's second term on guarantees he would consult in advance before taking radical policy steps.  Comment: Many analysts believe that AN's economic reform plan, which calls for elimination of subsidies on fuel, water, and electricity as well as raising taxes to counter declining oil prices, will likely pass the Majles in late February despite concerns the plan will increase inflation and unemployment.  According to a Tehran-based political risk analyst, AN's opponents are trying to remove the social welfare components (primarily cash payments in lieu of subsidies), in an effort to force AN to incur the public backlash for removing subsidies without the mitigating effect of cash handouts. Khamenei's pledge of financial resources restores AN's capacity to provide these handouts, and if needed to use patronage and subventions to boost his support.    5. [C/NF] Iranian Businessmen Facing Declining Demand, Cost Increases, Sanctions, and Subsidy Reform:  Iranian businessmen seeking visas in Dubai told IRPO Consular Officer that certain sectors of the Iranian economy are slowing, perhaps dramatically, and that businesses are struggling just to survive.  An iron salesman and a concrete salesman reported declining sales of 30 to 40 percent over the past quarter, which tracks with a general slowdown in the real estate and construction sectors.  A sugar factory owner estimated that 50 percent of Iranian factories may have closed or will soon do so.  He also noted that his factory's electricity bills now reflect two prices; one is the current subsidized price, and the second the price he would pay if subsidies were removed.  The  DUBAI 00000047  002.2 OF 002   subsidized price is four times higher, and this factory owner said he would be forced to close if subsidies were removed.  In addition to these woes, another Iranian industrialist noted that international economic and financial sanctions are driving up the cost of business and limiting investment - which is hitting the private sector especially hard.  Comment: Already strained to the breaking point, the Iranian private sector's survival may rest on derailing AN's subsidy reform plans.  If the bazaar protests of October 2008 (in response to an attempt to institute a VAT tax) and the unrest at the outset of the gas rationing system are any indication, such reforms will trigger upheaval. Managing this process will require considerable tact, and quite likely a dose of force by the IRIG.    6. [S/NF] IRIG Stops Historical Research International Visitor Exchange: IRIG officials have denied participants in the planned IVLP program on historical research permission to travel to the U.S. One participant told us that they were forbidden to travel to the U.S. "as a group" for the next two months but they could travel abroad as individuals.  The denial follows recent press reports of a new MFA commission established to vet travel connected to U.S. exchange programs.  Participants in the exchange program only learned of the permission requirement at the end of December.  Comment: The need for university professors to get permission from their universities for travel to the U.S. has been on the books for several years, but it has never been rigorously enforced. Likewise, MFA has generally been supportive of exchanges according to our contacts; however, the IRIG has prevented four other exchange programs from going traveling since September.  The two-month travel ban mentioned by the participant suggests the IRIG may be willing to revisit the issue of exchanges in a more systematic way, following the change in administrations and a possible overture from the U.S.    7. [C/NF]  Kargozaran Newspaper Closed - May Re-open Under New Name:  A journalist that formerly worked with the now closed newspaper Kargozaran told IRPO consular officer that the newspaper may re-open again under a new name in the future.  The Iranian government closed the newspaper on December 31, 2008 for publishing a commentary by the Office of Consolidating Unity, Iran's largest student group, "justifying the anti-human crimes of the Zionist regime" and denouncing Hamas actions as terrorism.  The relevant passage follows: "Today's crimes by Israel in Gaza should be strongly condemned.  But to the same extent, terrorists hiding among schools and hospitals and non-combatants should also be condemned and be considered an anti-humanitarian movement. "  Comment:  Kargozaran was the press organ of the Executives of Construction, a technocratic conservative de facto political party founded and sustained by Hashemi Rafsanjani.    8.

[S/NF] More on Russia-Iran Security Ties: In a follow up discussion with a former IRGC general regarding Russian security cooperation with Iran, he explained that Russia saw Iran as a "joint-venture" partner in extending its influence into the Middle East.  He noted that Iran's position was more advanced than simply that of an arms purchaser, however, citing the Russian acquiescence to an Iranian demand to provide a T-72 tank factory in the late 90s (while he was still in the IRGC).  For their part, the Russians wished to tie Iranian military procurement into Russian systems, making any move away difficult and increasing Russian influence on Iran.  IRPO officer asked specifically whether the S-300 system deliveries had gone forward.  The general replied that by now they were likely to have been delivered quietly, either through any number of ships at a Caspian port or on a Russian heavy transport aircraft with Ukrainian cooperation.  Russian-Iran security cooperation, he added, is not directly aimed at the US, but as Russia sees close ties with Iran as a means to project influence and gain access to warm water port facilities, they have strong incentives to prevent the US from improving its ties with Iran and probably displacing its influence.  For these reasons, he concluded, Russia continues to provide Iran a range of diplomatic and security favors - the S-300 and the Bushehr reactor being the most salient examples - to keep this important security relationship intact.    3. [S/NF] Supreme Leader's South Africa Connection? According to a scion of the Taleghani family (Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani was a key figure in Islamic opposition to the Shah), Supreme Leader Khamenei's sons Mojtaba and Mostafa have invested heavily (estimated in tens of billions USD) over the past year in various development projects in South Africa.  This point shed light on another well-placed IRPO contact's repeated references a few weeks ago to former South African President Nelson Mandela's possible role as a credible US-Iran intermediary. Comment: While our primary source suggested investment was in "heavy industry, " IRPO has no further information on the type and amount of investment.  As noted earlier in WOI (01/13/09), Mojtaba Khamenei is a principal gatekeeper to the Supreme Leader and was recently appointed as the Supreme Leaders Office point person on US-Iran relations.    4. [S/NF] A Different Khatami?: Later in the same discussion, as the topic turned to the upcoming presidential election, Taleghani's grandson cautioned against mistaking today's Khatami with the Khatami of 1992 (when he resigned as Minister of Culture) or 1999 (first term as President starts) or 2005 (second term concludes). He recounted a recent meeting with Khatami, where Khatami said that despite perceptions to the contrary, he struggled strenuously to support civil society and democratic freedoms inside Iran, but was unable to overcome the resistance of the Supreme Leader.  "Every time I left a meeting with Khamenei, I was soaked in sweat, "Khatami reportedly said. Now, this source continued, Khatami was a "determined democrat."  In fact, he added softly after scanning the vicinity to see who might be listening, "he no longer supports the principle of velayat-e faqih. "    5. [S/NF] Pourmohammadi Considering a Run - Rafsanjani's Chips Across the Board: Former Interior Minister (2005-2008) Hojjat ol-Islam Mustafa Pourmohammadi has reportedly begun exploring a run for the presidency.  Pourmohammadi currently heads the State Inspectorate Office (SIO).  According to an Iranian businessman just returning from a visit to Iran, the "real power" behind Pourmohammadi is IRGC Brigadier General Mohammad Zolghadr, who is considered the "political brain of the IRGC."  Zolghadr was Pourmohammadi's deputy at the Ministry of Interior.  If Pourmohammadi runs, said this businessman, hardliners will likely shift their support to Pourmohammadi because of their hatred of AN.  Our contact described Pourmohammadi as Hashemi Rafsanjani's "servant."  Meanwhile, AN fired Zolghadr after Zolghadr told a convention of governors that the U.S. threat to Iranian security should be taken seriously.  AN objected strongly and tried to cast the U.S. as too weakened to still  DUBAI 00000048  002.2 OF 002   pose a real danger to Iran.  Pourmohammadi resigned after AN fired Zolghadr because firing his deputy was taken as a direct affront.  Comment: Pourmohammadi and Zolghadr together represent a blending of intelligence and IRGC forces; a very formidable combination, not just electorally, but also in terms of their ability to maintain stability.  If Rafsanjani makes his support available to Pourmohammadi, it will mean he has lent his considerable influence to powerful challengers to AN from the left (Mousavi), center (Khatami), and right (Pourmohammadi).  It also means that AN will almost certainly lose a core constituency - the IRGC and Basij - to rivals far more well-regarded by both the leadership and the rank and file of these organizations.    6. [C] Rising Fears of Electoral Fraud in Advance of June 12 Presidential Election: An Iranian political analyst reported that Tehran political elites are increasingly concerned about the regime's ability to manipulate votes, given that both bodies responsible for administering and supervising the electoral process, the Interior Ministry and the Guardian Council, are currently controlled by hardliners.  He noted that presidential elections in 2001 and 2005 were run by an Interior Ministry that was in the hands of reformists; during this period, voter manipulation was generally confined to the final stages of the vetting process overseen by the Guardian Council.  In the upcoming election, however, both institutions will be dominated by conservatives, leading to fears that not only will the Guardian Council severely limit the candidates able to run for president, but that the Ministry of Interior will permit (or possibly engineer) large-scale fraud if deemed necessary. Comment:  These concerns about the potential for electoral fraud track with the reformist idea to call for UN observers, as discussed in last week's WOI (01/20/09).    7. [S/NF] Shirin Ebadi Departs Iran for Trip to the U.S.: According to a founding member of the One Million Signatures Campaign and close associate of Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel laureate left Tehran January 25 for Paris, where she will spend three days before continuing on to the United States. The source also said that in "the next few days" a group of Ebadi's supporters will publish a new website with more details of the January 1 mob attack on her office, including photos of the vandalized wall that was spray painted with "Shirin Ebadi = America." According to the activist, the intended message of the IRIG-orchestrated harassment is clear: challenges to the order are unacceptable and no one in Iran is untouchable.    8. [C] Getting Liquor Is Easier than Getting Credit:   Iranian contacts have told us consistently that liquor, banned movies, and other contraband are easily obtainable in Iran.  One Iranian-American businessman who travels frequently to Iran told us that he has never had trouble getting alcohol delivered to his door with just a phone call, with deliveries usually made by a family with young children to throw off suspicion.  Iranians are finding that international credit is not so accessible, he told us. Our contact said that Iranian businessmen seeking letters of credit to import British goods were unable to obtain letters of credit from British banks because of sanctions.  With no where else to turn, they were reportedly paying a 30 percent fee to brokers in Dubai to arrange credit for Western imports. Comment: These increased costs were being passed on to consumers to the extent possible, but the lack of accessible credit is making it harder and harder for private businesses to stay afloat, while those with governmental connections continue to finance their operations with government loans.    9.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)  1. (C) Summary: Since September, every International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) group from Iran has cancelled its travel to the United States, often at the last minute. Our access to participants is limited, but some have told us explicitly that they have been refused permission to travel or coerced into withdrawing from the program.  The IRIG's suspicion of these programs has been present from the start, but the recent heightened measures to prohibit Iranians' participation represents an active escalation in their position.  Charges leveled by the IRIG against exchange programs have lumped into a broader `conspiracy' including NGOs, academia, minority rights activists, and others, aimed at fomenting a `soft overthrow' of the IRIG.  Despite these setbacks, however, exchanges remain an effective way to engage Iran and its people, and IRPO will work closely with the Department to explore ways to continue these vital programs. End Summary.  EXCHANGES STOPPED -----------------  2. (C) Since late 2006, more than 200 Iranian visitors have come to the United States through a series of exchanges sponsored by the USG.  Topics for these exchanges have been purposefully apolitical to avoid enflaming Iranian suspicions.  With a few exceptions (Reftel), participants in these programs have told us that various ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and even elements in the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), have supported exchanges as a way to engage the United States. President Ahmadinejad and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have publicly stated their support for exchanges between America and Iran.  IVLP Alumni have also told us that these programs are instrumental in increasing partnerships and understanding between Iranians and Americans.  3. (C) Since September 2008, however, we have had to cancel programs in maternal health, child development, breast cancer awareness and historical research, all just days before the group's departure, and in one case, with two participants already in Dubai.  Earlier this fall, participants were more circumspect in discussing reasons for their sudden change of mind. What we have ascertained is that participants often were contacted by unidentified Iranian officials or Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) officers and told not to participate, sometimes with threats to their employment.  4. (C) In early January, participants in the historical research program were informed that they required permission from a newly formed MFA commission set up to vet exchanges with the United States.  The MFA denied their request, and we have not been able to develop further information about the commission and the scope of its authority.  One participant who dealt with the MFA told us, however, that the travel ban was subject to review in two months. (NOTE: We learned Jan. 28 that an IVLP group on substance abuse treatment, which assured us it had permission to travel, cancelled its trip, citing the inability of one participant to receive a visa before the group's scheduled departure. We do not know if this was the only factor or if the IRIG influenced its decision.)  CONSPIRACIES AND PLOTS ----------------------  5. (C) This crackdown appears to be part of broader IRIG worries of public discontent.  Over the past several weeks, Iranian officials have increased pressure on activists such as Shirin Ebadi, closed reformist newspapers, and repeatedly sounded the alarm of `velvet revolution.' Observers have suggested that this crackdown may be an effort to exert control over civil society so as not to appear weak in anticipation of negotiations with the U.S., an effort to divert public attention from the country's economic problems and other domestic  failures, or a real sense of vulnerability among ruling circles prior to upcoming presidential elections.  6. (C) Whatever the reason, the IRIG has chosen to focus its attention on what it believes are U.S. efforts intended to remove the regime. The head of MOIS' counterintelligence department said Jan. 19 that his agency had broken a spy ring centered around U.S. cultural exchange programs and intent on a `soft overthrow' of the IRIG. The Iranian official claimed that the U.S. conspiracy involved the CIA, AIPAC, IREX, the Woodrow Wilson Center and the Soros Open Society Foundation and targeted Iranian professionals and elites. He implicated IRPO and other Iran Watcher posts directly and named specific USG officials in describing U.S. machinations. The counterintelligence official named Arash Alaei, an alumni of an IVLP program, and his brother Kamyar, both well-known HIVAIDs researchers, as two of four  DUBAI 00000050  002 OF 002   Iranians arrested for espionage.  Arash and Kamyar were sentenced to six and three years in prison, respectively for their participation in this `plot.'  7. (C) Separately, one IRPO contact with access to Iranian officials told us that Iranian security officials believed that U.S. intelligence, working through an American representative of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as other U.S. institutions and NGOs, sought to organize espionage networks  in Iran.  They believed that the Alaei brothers were part of this network.  8. (C) IRIG efforts to halt exchanges appear to extend only to groups with an official USG connection, although it seems to have produced a chilling effect.  Individual Iranian scholars invited for fellowships at U.S. universities, Iranian sports teams competing or training in the U.S. and U.S. groups traveling to Iran generally have had little if any problem.  The recent visit of six U.S. university presidents to Iran received extensive positive coverage in the Iranian press. Iranians participating in non-USG exchanges in the U.S. have told us they were nervous about possible attention from MOIS, however.  COMMENT -------  9. (C) The IRIG makes no distinction between our exchange programs and what it believes is an on-going U.S. effort to undermine it.  The comments by the counterintelligence official suggest that it will continue to see any effort to engage the Iranian people without the involvement of the IRIG as interference in its internal affairs; however, continued success of sports diplomacy and the creation of the IRIG commission on exchanges suggest that the IRIG has not completely closed the door on exchange programs.  What it does indicate is that the IRIG has strong suspicions about them that will have to be taken into account if IVLP exchanges and other efforts in cultural diplomacy are to go forward. Despite these setbacks, however, exchanges remain an effective way to engage Iran and its people, and IRPO will work closely with the Department to explore ways ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Election Update - Rumors of Ahmadinejad's Delusions May Hurt His Chances, Khatami Poised to Enter, Velayati May Be Compromise Choice: Several of our Iran and Dubai based contacts have noted Ahmadinejad is facing a major reelection challenge, and that only the Supreme Leaders' active support keeps his reelection hopes on track.  This support may waver for a number of reasons, however, and may end entirely.  According to one well-connected Dubai-based source, a rumor is spreading that Ahmadinejad has been telling private audiences that he is the main pillar of the Islamic Republic, not the Supreme Leader. This source noted that, if this is true or the rumor takes root, the Supreme Leader may temper or suspend his support for Ahmadinejad.  Former President Khatami, meanwhile, has reportedly decided to run in the elections, although he has made no formal announcement.  While Khatami likely enjoys strong support from reformists, women and youth, according to a Dubai based Iranian businessman, regime insiders and some outsiders recall the Khatami period as a difficult and ultimately disappointing period which most are not eager to repeat. Speaking bluntly, one retired IRIG official noted that it ultimately came down to Khatami lacking any street-level cadres capable of battling the massive forces of the hardline Ansar-e Hezbollah thugs, the Basij, and other "pressure groups" that ruthlessly suppress dissent on behalf of regime hardliners. With both candidates flawed, multiple contacts tell us that consensus is building for former FM Ali Akbar Velayati to come forward as a compromise candidate.  Velayati currently serves as the foreign policy advisor to the Supreme Leader, and is viewed as "relatively moderate" by reformists.   Contacts described Velayati as "acceptable to all parties," "tractable," and less flatteringly - "lacking guts", a charge also at times leveled against Khatami.  Comment: A Velayati presidency under these conditions may see the office of the Presidency diminish in importance, with the Supreme Leader's Office and or the security establishment absorbing key parts of the President's mandate.    2. [C/NF] US-Iran Exchanges Should Continue, But In Other Direction: A Dubai based Iranian businessman and educator related to Ayatollah Shahroudi, the head of Iran's judiciary, told IRPO Officer that despite the recent setbacks on exchanges, such engagement should continue.  He made a point to affirm his continued support for cultural engagement, despite recent IRIG claims that such programs were merely part of a USG "velvet revolution" project, adding "we wouldn't be meeting if those claims were serious."  He noted that Iranian circles opposed to better ties between Americans and Iranians have clamped down on cultural diplomatic engagement due to anxiety about possible impacts on their domestic political fortunes.  This official's recommendation was to continue exchanges, but to focus on more exchanges from the US to Iran, which could help dispel doubts, empower advocates of cultural engagement inside Iran, and generate broad good will towards the US within Iran.  Comment: We can expect at least some elements in Iran to counter our efforts at engagement just as some work to counter other US policies which Iran's leaders feel threaten their interests.  If engagement is going to work, it will need to become more transparent and more bidirectional, and as we have suggested before, would greatly benefit from a non-governmental bilateral coordinating mechanism.    3. [S/NF] Alaei Brothers Reportedly "Well Treated": This same source noted that in discussions with Judiciary officials, they claimed that IVLP alumni Drs. Arash and Kamiar Alaei have been treated reasonably well during their imprisonment, have not been harshly interrogated or tortured, and have been allowed to receive family visits.  This would not have been the case if the IRIG thought they were truly dangerous, he noted.  He suggested this was a good sign, and speculated that they could be released well before their full sentences had been served.  Note: This information appears to contradict statements from the brothers' mother.    4. [C/NF]  Crackdown on Women's Rights Activists Just One Part of IRIG's Politicization of Social Issues: A long-time Iranian civil society activist described the various organizations that comprise the contemporary women's movement as 90% "charity-focused" and 10% "rights-focused."  As the advocates of expanded rights for women have coalesced around the One Million  DUBAI 00000051  002.2 OF 003   Signature Campaign in recent years, hardline authorities have grown increasingly wary of the "secular" nature of many of the activists, which they view as a potential threat to their rule and the stability of the system.  But the activist explained that since the election of Ahmadinejad, the government has consistently pushed civil society organizations operating in many fields, not just women's rights, underground by politicizing their activities and their motives.  She illustrated her point with a personal anecdote about a meditation and poetry class she attends in Tehran.  Though no aspect of the class, the teacher, or the students is at all political in the conventional sense, they feel compelled to meet in secret and take measures to prevent the authorities from learning about the class.  In her words, "now even reciting Hafez" is risky.  Comment: As this example illustrates, the broad and continuing IRIG crackdown on civil society has spread public anxiety to many organized group activities - even one as innocuous as poetry/meditation groups.  As many contacts have told us, the MOIS modus operandi is to monitor "suspicious" activity, but only act against civil society figures once they starting "organizing."  For this reason, Iranians are particularly wary of organizing collectively - recalling demonstratively harsh regime actions of the past - even if their activities are wholly apolitical.    5. [C/NF]  IRGC  Journal Predicts Bleak Future for U.S.-Iran Relations:  This week's edition of Sobh-e Sadeq, a weekly journal published by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, carries an editorial assessing that there are only  three potential scenarios for bilateral relations under the Obama administration: 1) continuation of the status quo, 2) further deterioration of the relationship, and 3) a "false start" in which the United States will press for engagement as a tactical maneuver, but ultimately find itself unable to accept a fundamental shift in the relationship because its policy is dictated by "other interests" in the Middle East.  The piece asserts that the U.S. needs improved relations with Iran, but that Iran has little to gain from rapprochement at this time. An IRPO contact who until several months ago worked closely with the IRIG observed that Iran's leadership feels emboldened after its "victories" in Gaza and Lebanon, and likely no longer feels that they face an imminent militarily threat from the U.S. or Israel.  Comment: The IRGC is just one - albeit a powerful one - of many power centers that comprise the political landscape in Iran.  While many hardline political figures, including President Ahmadinejad, have publicly questioned the sincerity of the new administration's commitment to engaging diplomatically, the IRGC appears to be trying to shape policy decisions in Iran to prevent engagement, a path they likely view as detrimental to their interests.    6. [C/NF] IRIB Anchor Dismisses Alleged Bias, Notes Economic Issues Attract Most Attention: An IRIB news anchor during a conversation with IRPO Officer dismissed reformers' complaints of official media bias.  He instead insisted that during past elections, IRIB has been ordered to provide all candidates with equal coverage and treat them fairly.  Aside from knowing the regime's red lines and abiding by them, he claimed no government interference in his work.  He said the Supreme Leader's direct control over IRIB prevented interference from other government entities.  The anchor also hosts a listener call-in show and said that his program elicits the most calls when it addresses economic issues, which now constitute about 40 percent of the show's broadcasts.  Comment:  The anchor's insistence of fair media treatment and no official interference is at odds with Iranian reformers' allegations of systematic bias against their candidates and the comments of a former Press TV employee, who alleged official monitoring (see reftel).  Although the Supreme Leader's control of IRIB may shield it from other government entities, IRIB is still susceptible to influence from the Supreme Leader's office.    7.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.  (C) Summary: Iran's best universities largely focus on engineering, which the country's top students pursue for its supposed financial reward.  Our interlocutors ranked Iran's best schools similarly, starting with Sharif University of Technology and generally concluding with the Islamic Azad University, Iran's largest university.  University admissions are largely based on performance on the nation-wide entrance exam though additional factors, such as Basij membership, may also be considered.  Adherence to government-policy was also said to be an important factor in determining faculty advancement.  Iranian universities are a mix of good and bad - of rigorous academic standards and in some cases, ideological pressure.  For most young Iranians, however, they are an avenue to financial reward. End Summary.    2. (C) IRPO officer in December 2008 and January 2009 met with Iranian students and professors to discuss Iranian universities.  He spoke with graduates from the University of Tehran and the Islamic Azad University, married professors from the University of Esfahan, and a professor from Tarbiat Modares University.    University Reputations    3.  (C) Iranian interlocutors consistently mentioned the same universities as Iran's best universities, including Sharif University of Technology, the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran University of Science and Technology, Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, the University of Isfahan, and the University of Shiraz.  The Islamic Azad graduate remarked that only "geniuses" attend Sharif University.  All of these schools primarily focus on engineering and technology programs.  Tehran University, in addition to its well-regarded engineering programs, has a broader range of programs, such as economics, history, and literature to choose from.  Tehran also features a department of North American and European Studies in its highly regarded School of Law and Political Science.    4.  (C) Iran's best students tend to pursue engineering programs or medical school. (Note:  Medical school in Iran begins after high school; students apply to a medical school as they would any other university.)  All our interlocutors explained that engineering and medical careers are financially rewarding, which is why they attract Iran's best students.    5.  (C) The University of Tehran graduate said that students at universities located in Tehran tend to be more politicized than elsewhere in Iran simply because Tehran is the capital.  The Islamic Azad graduate instead noted that students from the University of Tehran and Amirkabir University, in particular, have reputations for being more politically engaged. Continuing, he contrasted the University of Tehran, where students invite political speakers to campus or debate politics, to the branch of Islamic Azad he attended, where such a dialogue was wholly absent.    6.  (C) The private Islamic Azad University is Iran's largest university and has a mixed reputation for academics.  The Tehran University graduate spoke dismissively of it, saying that just about anyone can attend.  Islamic Azad has its own entrance exam and unlike the government universities, students pay tuition. According to its website, the university has roughly 1.3 million students spread over more than 300 branches inside Iran, and one overseas branch - in Dubai.  Although some of the locations may be full campuses, the Islamic Azad graduate said many of the branches, including the one he attended, are single buildings and he did not think the university had dorms.  He noted that the quality of the instruction at Islamic Azad varied by the program and by the location.    7.  (C) Islamic Azad considers itself a private institution and says that it receives no government financial support.  However,  DUBAI 00000056  002.2 OF 003   the University of Esfahan professors questioned the school's actual independence.  Expediency Council Chairman and head of the Assembly of Experts Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani founded the university in 1985, and is head of the university's board of trustees.  The University president is said to be a Rafsanjani ally.    Academic Materials and University Advancement    8.  (C) The professors maintained that they use up-to-date texts and other materials in their classrooms, though they conceded that some professors do not and the quality of the material varied by university and by professor.  The couple from the University of Esfahan also said that the students too should be responsible for doing their own internet research to ensure that their material is current.  They also said that the IRIG helps academics purchase text books.  The Tarbiat Modares professor added that his university, beginning three years ago, started pressing faculty members to publish two papers a year in established journals.  An Iranian Canadian academic who has done research in Iran told us separately that Iran lags far behind the West in social science research.  She said texts and research materials in these disciplines were outdated, and many of the best professors had been forced into retirement.    9.  (C) The University of Esfahan professors said that advancement within the university reflects ideology as well as academic background.  They complained remaining beardless or speaking out against university policies can jeopardize one's advancement. (Comment:  Although the professors did not attribute the ideological standards to Ahmadinejad, their comments are consistent with the president's efforts to change, in his words, the "secular education system."  Ahmadinejad's government subsequently forced many university professors into retirement.  Some such professors were later offered positions at Islamic Azad University.)    The Road to University Admissions    10.  (C) Iranian students aspiring to attend universities in Iran must first take the university entrance exam, or Konkur. All interlocutors stressed the difficulty of the exam and the amount of time students spend preparing for the test.  The University of Esfahan professors explained that their daughter, who is currently preparing for the Konkur, spends as much as 16 hours a day studying.  Having helped her prepare, they said that the material she studies is occasionally PhD level.  Separately, the Islamic Azad University graduate said he spent all of high school preparing for the test.  The test takes an entire day to complete; afterwards, students are ranked according to their performance, from one to as many students that took the test.    11.  (C) The Esfahan professors said that the Konkur's difficulty and importance have created a cottage industry of private tutoring.  They complained that some teachers will purposely degrade the quality of their in-school teaching to drive up demand for their private tutoring.    12.  (C) After receiving their scores, students apply to specific programs within universities rather than to the university itself.  For example, the Islamic Azad graduate said that he applied to medical engineering programs at Amirkabir University in Tehran, Sahand University of Technology in Tabriz, and a branch of Islamic Azad University in Tehran.  He chose Islamic Azad because Amirkabir University's medical engineering faculty also taught at Islamic Azad.  After matriculating, changing degree programs is difficult.    13.  (C) Universities primarily consider students' Konkur score when weighing applicants, but our interlocutors specified  DUBAI 00000056  003.2 OF 003   several other factors that may be considered.  These include the average Konkur score of an applicant's high school, Basij membership, gender, and whether an applicant is related to a soldier killed in the Iran-Iraq war.  Basij membership or being the child of an Iran-Iraq war victim was said to confer a "point," however the weight of such a point is not clear.  The married professors from Esfahan University said the government has started reserving 70 percent of university seats for males in order to correct a gender imbalance now favoring females; the professors were clearly worried that their daughter would not do well enough to gain entry. (Comment:  The number of Iranian women attending university has been steadily increasing for several years and in 2008 65 percent of Iranian university students were women.)    COMMENT    14.  (C) Iran's universities are a mix of good and bad; its best universities are known internationally and avenues exist, primarily via the sprawling Islamic Azad, to make higher education broadly available, albeit at high cost.  The government universities are, however, another means for the IRIG to exert ideological influence, either by rewarding Basij members with easier admissions or punishing professors not heeding the regime's line.  Iranians value education strongly, but Iran's best students now view its importance more as a means for financial gain or exit from Iran. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  Four leading Iranian women's rights activists described a robust, growing movement that is expanding its reach beyond young professional women, despite an aggressive crack-down by hardliners on individual activists.  The struggle for women's equality in Iran has become more focused and better organized since the inception of the grass-roots One Million Signatures Campaign two and a half years ago, according to the women.  In their opinion, hardliners in the government are less threatened by the prospect of gender equality than the existence of any sort of "people's movement" that could form the basis of a political opposition to the regime, particularly one with ties to the West. End Summary    One Million Signatures Now Locus of Women's Rights Movement    2. (C) IRPO officer recently spoke separately with four leading women's rights activists from Iran who plan to attend the UN Status of Women conference in New York in early March.  They said that the women's movement in Iran has finally found its footing in the form of the grass-roots One Million Signature Campaign.  The Campaign's goal is to educate Iranians about the societal consequences of discriminatory laws against women and to build widespread support among Iranians for government recognition and legal protection of gender equality.  Campaign members rely primarily on person-to-person education and the internet to spread their message.    3. (C) According to the activists, their movement is gaining momentum "faster than ever" despite the IRIG's increasingly aggressive crack-down on activists, especially those associated with the One Million Signatures Campaign.  (Note: To date, 47 campaigners have been arrested; many have been sentenced to jail time and/or lashes.)  They asserted that regime pressure has had the opposite effect: invigorating their cause and building support among Iranians for expansion of women's rights.  The very public harassment and imprisonment of women (and the occasional man) for simply seeking improved rights is viewed by most Iranians as a disproportionate reaction on the part of the regime, and ultimately signals the hardliners' weakness rather than their strength.    4. (C) The activists said that most Iranians recognize that the goals of the movement are limited to improving the rights of women through the revision of laws and the "correct" implementation of laws already on the books and rights already afforded to women by the constitution.  Since the mainstream movement proponents are neither challenging Iran's form of government, the stability of the current regime, nor even the supremacy of the velayat-e faqih, the government's heavy-handed approach is producing a discernable backlash against the hardliners, who are increasingly viewed as bullies by the general public.  One activist noted that the lashings and jail sentences typically given to Campaigners by the revolutionary courts garner widespread sympathetic media coverage inside Iran, especially on blogs.    Hardliners Pursue "Personalized Terrorism" Against Activists    5. (C) A long-time activist who combines her advocacy for women's rights with activism on environmental issues described how the regime conducts "personalized terror" by relating her own experience with security agents who have been tracking her for years.  She said that since her arrest in 2006 for attending a hearing of fellow activists at a revolutionary court, she has been harassed on a regular basis by MOIS agents who attempt to "control" her activities by exploiting personal information about her family.  For example, she said that she is frequently subjected to prolonged interrogations that coincide with her husband's chemotherapy sessions for prostrate cancer.  She also alleged that the security agents tracking her discovered that her son was gay and promptly disseminated this information, leading to an "announcement" of his sexual orientation in several papers and his arrest.  She stated that her son, who was a university student in Tehran, fled to Germany earlier this  DUBAI 00000057  002.2 OF 003   year after having been arrested three times.   She assessed this harassment of family members is hardliners' greatest source of pressure, and she observed that the impunity with which the security agents operate has turned Iran into an "open prison."    Women Claim Some Successes Despite Increased Repression    6. (C) All four women noted that the government's tolerance for rights activists has decreased markedly since President Ahmadinejad took office in 2005.  They pointed to the government's aggressive actions against campaign activists as the reason they had only been able to collect 200,000 signatures in two and a half years.  Strikingly, however, they were optimistic that many of their goals would eventually be realized.  One pointed out that Iranian women are "too well educated" and "too interested in the world" to be treated as inferior to males indefinitely.    7. (C) One founding member of the Campaign and leading opponent to the use of execution by stoning cautioned that it was wrong to think the movement hadn't made gains in recent years.  She pointed to the defeat of the conservatives' attempt in 2008 to revise the family law to make multiple marriages easier as a concrete accomplishment of activists.  She also attributed the decrease in executions by stoning to the women's rights movement, saying that once people became aware that stoning sentences were given to women much more frequently than to men, the public outcry over the issue became too loud for the authorities to ignore.  She claimed that violations of judiciary chief Ayatollah Shahroudi's directive banning execution by stoning were carried out by renegade local judges who knew they were acting in defiance of the government's order.  She pointed out that the December 2008 stoning of two men in Mashhad was carried out in a cemetery at night was evidence of that carrying out such punishment was no longer publicly sanctioned.    "Organic" Roots Key to the Movement's Survival    8. (C) The activists all emphasized the organic roots of the women's movement, with one woman observing that "Iranians don't need help from outsiders," while another cautioned that foreign support for their activities would only confirm the regime's "paranoia" and provide a pretext for increased regime repression.  According to one founding member of the Campaign, since the project's inception in 2006 they have strictly prohibited accepting money from foreign governments or organizations, although they do accept donations from individuals outside of Iran.  She stated flatly that "giving money to NGOs is the worst thing the American government has done for human rights in my country since they overthrew Mosaddegh."  However, she said that donations by individual American citizens have been an important source of revenue and pointed to Campaign co-founder Sussan Tahmasebi's successful fundraising in the U.S. as a critical source of the group's funding. (Note: Tahmasebi is a dual national of Iran and the United States.) She noted that only the signatures of Iranian nationals counted against the million signature goal.    9. (C) The Campaign's use of person-to-person education has also helped the movement gain traction, especially among sectors of society beyond professional women.  According to one activist, the Campaign has developed a "Mothers' Committee" and a "Fathers' Committee" as their primary vehicles for conducting outreach to Iranians belonging to older generations.  She said that peers are much more likely to garner the support of older Iranians than are young women, whose activism is often regarded with suspicion or fear by older Iranians.    Comment     DUBAI 00000057  003.2 OF 003   10. (C) Though the women unanimously expressed confidence that the movement's long-term goals for women's equality in Iran would be met, they were clearly taken aback by the audacity of the recent harassment of Shirin Ebadi, which they interpreted as a direct assault on their own operations because of her close association with the Campaign.  Similarly, they were upbeat about the Campaign's ability to strengthen civil society through education and increasing public awareness, but their optimism seemed to reflect the value and importance of the cause they are pursuing rather than tangible evidence of their gains.  Despite concerted efforts to portray their efforts as working within the system, the activists privately expressed skepticism that participation in the current political system could ever yield positive results.  As one of the women bitterly responded when asked if she would vote in the June presidential election or if the Campaign would endorse a candidate, "it doesn't matter who is elected because the system itself is rotten."

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.  [U] This January 27, 2009 edition of Window on Iran was sent out on that date via classified e-mail.    2. [S/NF] More on Russia-Iran Security Ties: In a follow up discussion with a former IRGC general regarding Russian security cooperation with Iran, he explained that Russia saw Iran as a "joint-venture" partner in extending its influence into the Middle East.  He noted that Iran's position was more advanced than simply that of an arms purchaser, however, citing the Russian acquiescence to an Iranian demand to provide a T-72 tank factory in the late 90s (while he was still in the IRGC).  For their part, the Russians wished to tie Iranian military procurement into Russian systems, making any move away difficult and increasing Russian influence on Iran.  IRPO officer asked specifically whether the S-300 system deliveries had gone forward.  The general replied that by now they were likely to have been delivered quietly, either through any number of ships at a Caspian port or on a Russian heavy transport aircraft with Ukrainian cooperation.  Russian-Iran security cooperation, he added, is not directly aimed at the US, but as Russia sees close ties with Iran as a means to project influence and gain access to warm water port facilities, they have strong incentives to prevent the US from improving its ties with Iran and probably displacing its influence.  For these reasons, he concluded, Russia continues to provide Iran a range of diplomatic and security favors - the S-300 and the Bushehr reactor being the most salient examples - to keep this important security relationship intact.    3. [S/NF] Supreme Leader's South Africa Connection?: According to a scion of the Taleghani family (Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani was a key figure in Islamic opposition to the Shah), Supreme Leader Khamenei's sons Mojtaba and Mostafa have invested heavily (estimated in tens of billions USD) over the past year in various development projects in South Africa.  This point shed light on another well-placed IRPO contact's repeated references a few weeks ago to former South African President Nelson Mandela's possible role as a credible US-Iran intermediary. Comment: While our primary source suggested investment was in "heavy industry," IRPO has no further information on the type and amount of investment.  As noted earlier in WOI (01/13/09), Mojtaba Khamenei is a principal gatekeeper to the Supreme Leader and was recently appointed as the Supreme Leaders Office point person on US-Iran relations.    4. [S/NF] A Different Khatami?: Later in the same discussion, as the topic turned to the upcoming presidential election, Taleghani's grandson cautioned against mistaking today's Khatami with the Khatami of 1992 (when he resigned as Minister of Culture) or 1999 (first term as President starts) or 2005 (second term concludes). He recounted a recent meeting with Khatami, where Khatami said that despite perceptions to the contrary, he struggled strenuously to support civil society and democratic freedoms inside Iran, but was unable to overcome the resistance of the Supreme Leader.  "Every time I left a meeting with Khamenei, I was soaked in sweat," Khatami reportedly said. Now, this source continued, Khatami was a "determined democrat."  In fact, he added softly after scanning the vicinity to see who might be listening, "he no longer supports the principle of velayat-e faqih."    5. [S/NF] Pourmohammadi Considering a Run - Rafsanjani's Chips Across the Board: Former Interior Minister (2005-2008) Hojjat ol-Islam Mustafa Pourmohammadi has reportedly begun exploring a run for the presidency.  Pourmohammadi currently heads the State Inspectorate Office (SIO).  According to an Iranian businessman just returning from a visit to Iran, the "real power" behind Pourmohammadi is IRGC Brigadier General Mohammad Zolghadr, who is also the current head of the Basij and the "political brain of the IRGC."  Zolghadr was Pourmohammadi's deputy at the Ministry of Interior.  If Pourmohammadi runs, said this businessman, hardliners will likely shift their support to Pourmohammadi because of their hatred of AN.  Our contact described Pourmohammadi as Hashemi Rafsanjani's "servant." Meanwhile, AN fired Zolghadr after Zolghadr told a convention of  DUBAI 00000058  002.2 OF 003   governors that the U.S. threat to Iranian security should be taken seriously.  AN objected strongly and tried to cast the U.S. as too weakened to still pose a real danger to Iran. Pourmohammadi resigned after AN fired Zolghadr because firing his deputy was taken as a direct affront.  Comment: Pourmohammadi and Zolghadr together represent a blending of intelligence and IRGC forces; a very formidable combination, not just electorally, but also in terms of their ability to maintain stability.  If Rafsanjani makes his support available to Pourmohammadi, it will mean he has lent his considerable influence to powerful challengers to AN from the left (Mousavi), center (Khatami), and right (Pourmohammadi).  It also means that AN will almost certainly lose a core constituency - the IRGC and Basij - to rivals far more well-regarded by both the leadership and the rank and file of these organizations.    6. [C] Rising Fears of Electoral Fraud in Advance of June 12 Presidential Election: An Iranian political analyst reported that Tehran political elites are increasingly concerned about the regime's ability to manipulate votes, given that both bodies responsible for administering and supervising the electoral process, the Interior Ministry and the Guardian Council, are currently controlled by hardliners.  He noted that presidential elections in 2001 and 2005 were run by an Interior Ministry that was in the hands of reformists; during this period, voter manipulation was generally confined to the final stages of the vetting process overseen by the Guardian Council.  In the upcoming election, however, both institutions will be dominated by conservatives, leading to fears that not only will the Guardian Council severely limit the candidates able to run for president, but that the Ministry of Interior will permit (or possibly engineer) large-scale fraud if deemed necessary. Comment:  These concerns about the potential for electoral fraud track with the reformist idea to call for UN observers, as discussed in last week's WOI (01/20/09).    7. [S/NF] Shirin Ebadi Departs Iran for Trip to the U.S.: According to a founding member of the One Million Signatures Campaign and close associate of Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel laureate left Tehran January 25 for Paris, where she will spend three days before continuing on to the United States. The source also said that in "the next few days" a group of Ebadi's supporters will publish a new website with more details of the January 1 mob attack on her office, including photos of the vandalized wall that was spray painted with "Shirin Ebadi = America." According to the activist, the intended message of the IRIG-orchestrated harassment is clear: challenges to the order are unacceptable and no one in Iran is untouchable.    8. [C] Getting Liquor Is Easier than Getting Credit: Iranian contacts have told us consistently that liquor, banned movies, and other contraband are easily obtainable in Iran.  One Iranian-American businessman who travels frequently to Iran told us that he has never had trouble getting alcohol delivered to his door with just a phone call, with deliveries usually made by a family with young children to throw off suspicion.  Iranians are finding that international credit is not so accessible, he told us. Our contact said that Iranian businessmen seeking letters of credit to import British goods were unable to obtain letters of credit from British banks because of sanctions.  With no where else to turn, they were reportedly paying a 30 percent fee to brokers in Dubai to arrange credit for Western imports. Comment: These increased costs were being passed on to consumers to the extent possible, but the lack of accessible credit is making it harder and harder for private businesses to stay afloat, while those with governmental connections continue to finance their operations with government loans.    9.

DUBAI 00000071  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  Though Khatami's decision to run for president gives reformist factions in Iran a cohesive leader with undeniable brand recognition, the former president faces a vastly different political landscape than in 1997, when he rode a tidal wave of popular support to victory. After two terms in office, during which time he was unable to implement most of the political reforms promised, his luster has faded.  Khatami's ability to win, should the race effectively come down to a two-person contest between himself and Ahmadinejad, will depend greatly on his ability to convince enough voters to participate in a system they disdain in return for small improvements in economic management, personal liberties, and a less confrontational public face to present to the world.  Khatami will also face an increased likelihood of voter manipulation as the two institutions charged with administering the election are in the hands of conservatives.  Many key factors that will shape the outcome of the race, not the least of which is the final candidate list, remain undefined.  Nevertheless, Khatami's entry will force factions across Iran's political spectrum to re-assess their electoral strategy in preparation for the June 12 contest.  End summary.    Khatami Enters the Fray    2. (C) Former two-term president Seyyed Mohammad Khatami ended months of public equivocation February 8 with the formal announcement of his intent to stand in Iran's June 12 presidential election.  Khatami had come under strong pressure to run in recent months from fellow reformers, who view him as their best chance to regain the presidency from the conservative establishment, which consolidated its grip on Iran's various power centers through wins aQthe local level in 2003, the Majles takeover in 2004, and finally Ahmadinejad' election in 2005.    3. (C) Khatami's improbable first victory in 1997, in which he defied conventional wisdom by roundly defeating the right's candidate Ahmed Nateq Nuri with some 70% of the vote, was so unexpected that according to one prominent analyst, it is difficult to articulate the sense of `national euphoria' the event engendered.  And despite a widespread sense that Khatami had been unable to translate his landslide victory into meaningful political reform, voters overwhelmingly supported a second term for him in 2001.    4. (C) After eight years in office, Khatami, and the reformers by extension, left the presidency discredited, having failed to deliver promised political reform at home and with their attempts to soften Iran's foreign policy undermined by spoilers within the security establishment and rebuffed in no uncertain terms by the United States.  Conservatives capitalized on the reformers' disarray and the electorate's growing quiescence by disqualifying over 3,000 reformist candidates for the 2004 parliamentary election, thus engineering a conservative takeover of the Majles.  The extent of the reformers' disorganization, as well as the profound sense of disappointment among their core constituent groups, helped pave the way for the Ahmadinejad's election in 2005.    Why 2009 is not 1997    5. (C) Khatami's unexpected victory in 1997 can be attributed to two main factors: overwhelming support among the populace for both the reformist agenda generally and his candidacy specifically, and the conservative establishment's failure to understand the extent to which Khatami's candidacy would resonate with the public.

(C) The landslide nature of Khatami's electoral victories was  DUBAI 00000071  002.2 OF 003   perhaps the most important check against fraud.  According to one analyst, though truckloads of fakes ballots were apprehended, there were simply not enough fakes to overcome the greater number of legitimate votes cast for Khatami.  Support for the reformers among bureaucrats overseeing the administration of the election from the Ministry of Interior also helped to ensure that the election was not stolen from Khatami.    7. (C) In 2009, Khatami faces a radically altered landscape. The highly personalized enthusiasm that many supporters once felt for Khatami and the reformist agenda has substantially eroded. Khatami's ability to attract support on the scale of that which led to his landslide victories in 1997 and 2001 is doubtful.  Voters of the so-called `Khatami Generation' - university students who turned out in droves for him - now express regret over having legitimized the system by participating in the elections.  One Iranian businesswomen in her 30s recently recounted how as a university student she cajoled her four siblings into campaigning and voting for Khatami in 1997 despite her parents' admonishment not to `sully' her identity card by acquiring the government stamp proving she voted.  `Now,? she observed bitterly, `I hate Khatami worse than Ahmadinejad and all the mullahs because he made me believe in a lie.'    8. (C) Although other IRPO contacts have not evinced the same visceral reaction, few of Khatami's past supporters that we have spoken with seem willing to vote for him again.  Two Iranian businessmen and a businesswoman in their 30s who recalled celebrating Khatami's 1997 victory at spontaneous parties now describe themselves and their cohort as indifferent.  None were inclined to vote in the June election, although the businesswoman said she would be more likely to support former Foreign Minister and possible candidate Ali Akbar Velayati over Khatami because as Khamenei's `right hand,' Velayati would accomplish more as president, including improving ties with the US.  An interior designer who voted for Khatami in 1997 said he had note voted since and had little interest in even discussing the election.  He said he now just `lived his life' without worrying about the country's political machinations.    9. (C) In addition to the pervasive sense of disappointment among one-time Khatami enthusiasts, many members of the political elite point with alarm to the increased potential for fraud this election.  Unlike previous elections, this year the two institutions charged with overseeing and administering the electoral process - the Guardian Council and the Ministry of Interior - are both firmly in the hands of hardliners. According to domestic press reports, a reformist MP from Abadan recently called attention to the `suspicious' and abrupt manner with which the central government has been appointing new provincial and district level governors ahead of the election. A Tehran-based consulting firm noted these officials will play key roles in administering the election.

DUBAI 00000072  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (d) 1. (C) Summary:  Though Khatami's decision to run for president gives reformist factions in Iran a cohesive leader with undeniable brand recognition, the former president faces a vastly different political landscape than in 1997, when he rode a tidal wave of popular support to victory. After two terms in office, during which time he was unable to implement most of the political reforms promised, his luster has faded.  Khatami's ability to win, should the race effectively come down to a two-person contest between himself and Ahmadinejad, will depend greatly on his ability to convince enough voters to participate in a system they disdain in return for small improvements in economic management, personal liberties, and a less confrontational public face to present to the world.  Khatami will also face an increased likelihood of voter manipulation as the two institutions charged with administering the election are in the hands of conservatives.  Many key factors that will shape the outcome of the race, not the least of which is the final candidate list, remain undefined.  Nevertheless, Khatami's entry will force factions across Iran's political spectrum to re-assess their electoral strategy in preparation for the June 12 contest.  End summary.    Khatami Enters the Fray    2. (C) Former two-term president Seyyed Mohammad Khatami ended months of public equivocation February 8 with the formal announcement of his intent to stand in Iran's June 12 presidential election.  Khatami had come under strong pressure to run in recent months from fellow reformers, who view him as their best chance to regain the presidency from the conservative establishment, which consolidated its grip on Iran's various power centers through wins at the local level in 2003, the Majles takeover in 2004, and finally Ahmadinejad' election in 2005.    3. (C) Khatami's improbable first victory in 1997, in which he defied conventional wisdom by roundly defeating the right's candidate Ahmed Nateq Nuri with some 70% of the vote, was so unexpected that according to one prominent analyst, it is difficult to articulate the sense of `national euphoria' the event engendered.  And despite a widespread sense that Khatami had been unable to translate his landslide victory into meaningful political reform, voters overwhelmingly supported a second term for him in 2001.    4. (C) After eight years in office, Khatami, and the reformers by extension, left the presidency discredited, having failed to deliver promised political reform at home and with their attempts to soften Iran's foreign policy undermined by spoilers within the security establishment and rebuffed in no uncertain terms by the United States.  Conservatives capitalized on the reformers' disarray and the electorate's growing quiescence by disqualifying over 3,000 reformist candidates for the 2004 parliamentary election, thus engineering a conservative takeover of the Majles.  The extent of the reformers' disorganization, as well as the profound sense of disappointment among their core constituent groups, helped pave the way for the Ahmadinejad's election in 2005.    Why 2009 is not 1997    5. (C) Khatami's unexpected victory in 1997 can be attributed to two main factors: overwhelming support among the populace for both the reformist agenda generally and his candidacy specifically, and the conservative establishment's failure to understand the extent to which Khatami's candidacy would resonate with the public.  Both elements were critical to the reformers' ability to overcome the fact that virtually every key pillar of political and financial power had lined up in support of Nateq Nuri, creating the pervasive sense that he was ?destined? to win the presidency.    6. (C) The landslide nature of Khatami's electoral victories was  DUBAI 00000072  002.2 OF 003   perhaps the most important check against fraud.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Larijani's Speech at Munich Security Conference Calls for Strategy Change:  In his speech to the conference on 9 February, Iranian Majles Speaker Ali Larijani listed the failures of US and Western strategy on a wide array of issues, but welcomed the opportunity for a strategic reset under the new US administration.  Larijani welcomed Special Envoy Mitchell's visit and his willingness to listen and appreciate the cultural context of the region.  He added that the time for unilateralism and domination by the West of the East is over.  Turning to the Iranian nuclear case, he declared that nuclear weapons are not part of Iranian defense doctrine and possession and use of all WMDs to violate Islamic principles.  Calling for a change of strategy and not just tactics, he noted that the "carrot and stick" policy is obsolete and irrational, and that continuing it would be a step in the wrong direction.  He then declared that Iran is ready and able to work in cooperation with other countries towards comprehensive peace and stability in the region.  He added that America had demolished many bridges over recent years that the new US administration can reconstruct, but that this reconstruction would require "a new and pragmatic strategy based on mutual respect and fair behavior, and not repeating the old carrot-and-stick statements of the past." Comment: Without question, Larijani, a regime stalwart close to Supreme Leader Khamene'i, was delivering the official Iranian position on these issues as authorized by Khamene'i.  (Over the past 24 hours, the essence of this "strategic, not tactical change" message has been picked up by President Ahmadinejad. This IRIG approach places the ball in the US court to take concrete actions to distinguish the new administration's strategic vision from past approaches.)  Larijani's statement of Iran's announced readiness to work with "other countries" is vague, but leaves out the perennial coda which IRIG figures usually attach to this statement - "except Israel".  Our sense is that this is an intentional and not insignificant omission.    2. [S/NF] Khatami Finally Enters Presidential Race: As detailed further in RPO Dubai 71, Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, former President of Iran from 1997-2005, has formally entered the race for president.  With elections swiftly approaching (June 12) Khatami will need to work hard to convince voters his second tenure as president would turn out differently than his last. Twenty million-plus voters placed high hopes in Khatami in 1997 and 2001, when he won landslide victories featuring 70 and 72 percent majorities.  His inability to translate this massive public mandate into real and lasting change left many disillusioned, particularly those now in their late 20s and early 30s who breathlessly turned out for Khatami as a harbinger of a Tehran Spring.  Such lower expectations may actually enhance Khatami's ability to govern effectively, particularly if he can pull in expected support from technocratic and traditional conservative elements deeply opposed to another Ahmadinejad term.  Moreover, voters generally acknowledge that Khatami provides a far more palatable regional and international image of Iran than the bellicose and zealous Ahmadinejad. However, many of the key factors that will shape the outcome of this race, including the final list of candidates, remain unclear.    3. [C/NF]  Iranian Real Estate and Construction Sectors in Pronounced Downturn: Iranian visa applicants in Dubai have alternatively described the Iranian economy as somewhat "broken" and "sluggish." Three owners of a tool store in Tehran said their business has dropped 30 percent in the past two months; they attributed their slowing sales to lower oil prices, the decline in Iran's construction market, and exchange rate fluctuations.  They alleged that Iranians are becoming hesitant to spend their money and, as real estate had been the primary investment vehicle in Iran, that sector is suffering.  An Iranian real estate agent and a businessman in the construction industry both said that real estate prices are down 30 percent. The tool store owners and the businessman anticipate a downturn of at least a year; they all added that uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election is contributing to Iran's economic malaise.  Comment:  Iran's real estate market soared in recent years.  Visa applicants last fall maintained that real estate prices had leveled off, but not begun to drop.  Now, dropping real estate prices are likely to make Iran's well-to-do-and all those who had purchased property - more  DUBAI 00000075  002.2 OF 002   attuned to Iran's economic downturn. That our interlocutors connected Iran's economic troubles to the election underscores the importance of the economy in the June presidential election.    4. [S/NF] AN Advisor Lauds Warm Turkey-Iran Ties:  A Dubai-based Iranian political analyst who participated in the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month observed that Mojtaba Hashemi Samare, a close advisor of Ahmadinejad, appeared to be on very good terms with Ali Babacan, the Turkish Foreign Minister. According to our contact, the two greeted each other "old friends" and spoke privately for several minutes before Samare began addressing the assembled lunch audience.  Samare also directly addressed Babacan at the beginning of his remarks, thanking him for his attendance and highlighting good relations between Iran and Turkey, countries he deemed "natural allies." In his speech, Samare repeated Ahmadinejad's recent calls for the United States to "apologize" to Iran for historical grievances.  Samare reacted defensively to a comment during the question and answer session from an Iranian attendee who noted that if Tehran is serious about engaging on the basis of "mutual respect," Iranian leaders should also immediately tone down the rhetoric and cease orchestrating demonstrations led by chants of "Death to America."    5. [S/NF] Cultural Affairs Working Group - Now May Be the Time: Given the current state of Iranian skepticism regarding the intentions of USG people-to-people engagement measures, which they maintain are merely cover for velvet revolution plans, numerous IRPO contacts contend the only way forward is to take measures to depoliticize and demystify exchanges and other cultural diplomacy initiatives.  Based on our discussions with a range of Iranian contacts and a close reading of Iran's domestic media reaction, if the policy conditions are right, this would be the ideal time to roll out the Cultural Affairs Working Group proposal.  This non-governmental, bipartisan working group including representatives from the academic, scientific, artistic, and athletic communities in both countries would meet to vet and streamline the exchange process.  Such a group would greatly reduce risks to participants and wasted resources plaguing current arrangements.  As the badminton team's recent experience clearly showed, without at least some level of explicit official buy-in from the other side, even the least threatening exchanges can easily go awry.  As we approach the planned trip of the USA Wrestling Team, this is a perfect time to set up this mechanism and test the good will of the Iranians through its performance on this important exchange.    6. [C] Film Remains A Key Vehicle For Cultural Engagement: A prominent Iranian film producer told us that he and renowned Iranian director Darius Mehrjui were planning to make a film in the U.S. this spring but would not announce shooting publicly because of the current political sensitivities in Iran over relations with the U.S.  Although IRIG decision making regarding anything related to the U.S. had become more ambiguous and uncertain, he said that in the prevailing climate, it was unlikely that Iranian censors would be favorably inclined toward this film.  Set in Atlantic City, the film would be the story of a Muslim immigrant who finds work in one of the city's casinos. He predicted, however, that the presidential election would bring about a positive change in Iran because of the intense popular resentment of Ahmadinejad and the repression of artistic and other freedoms.  Like other Iranian film makers we have met, he said film and cooperation between the U.S. and Iranian film industries had great potential for promoting good will in each country.  In an aside, another producer present at the meeting told us that senior officials at IRIB had quietly expressed interest in promoting these cooperative efforts.  Comment: This is one of several recent but separate efforts we have heard to promote U.S. and Iranian cooperation in the film community.  We agree that collaboration between film makers, whether documentaries or feature films, can help to reach large audiences in Iran, delivering positive messages about the U.S. We are looking at ways we might facilitate some of these contacts.

(S/NF) On February 5, Ambassador met with Riad Khawaji, founder and CEO of the Dubai-based defense think tank the Institute for Near East and Military Analysis (INEGMA).  Among other things, he told Ambassador that he intends to hold a conference in the early summer on the topic Iran.  He has been discussing this proposed conference with IRIG official Sayyed Kazem Sajjadpour, the former IRIG Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva.  (Note: Ambassador Sajjadpour may currently be working with an MFA affiliated thinktank).    3. (S/NF) Two aspects of this project are of particular note. First, while this is theoretically an academic conference, Riad envisions attendance by the top flight think tanks from Europe, North America and Russia that are often surrogates for official thinking.  I urged him to think about USIP in addition to Brookings, etc.   Second, Sajjadpour, clearly thinking in Track II terms, told Riad that it would be "easier" to hold free discussions in Dubai than elsewhere, indicating a high level of IRIG interest in possible track II discussions.    4. (S/NF) Meanwhile, Iranian government officials seizing upon the initial signs from the new US administration, including Majles Speaker Larijani, President Ahmadinejad, and IRGC founder Mohsen Rezaie have stated over the past week the IRIG's willingness to support a realistic reappraisal of regional security thinking aimed at reducing regional tensions.  The willingness of at least one regime official to consider Dubai as a venue may indicate the IRIG's interest in opening such discussions up to an international audience.  ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Khatami Scares Hardliners Into Compromise?:  Former president Khatami's recent entry into the presidential race has spurred hardliners and conservatives into action.  Two days after his entry, Khatami was menaced by street thugs tied to the Basij chanting "we don't want an American government" and had to be defended by supporters.  Then the hardline daily Kayhan compared Khatami to Benazir Bhutto, whom they claim was an American client, and mused that a similar fate to Bhutto's may await him.  Within this ominous context, hardliners including the powerful Islamic Coalition Society, or Motallafeh, met to consider election strategy.  So anxious that a Khatami presidency might signal the end of hardliner control over the economy and key parts of the government, a hardline MP confirmed to the press the faction's readiness to withdraw their substantial support for AN in favor of an "alternative candidate" if Khatami withdraws from the race.  Comment: Taken together, these developments demonstrate that: first, hardliner opposition to Khatami's return to power is fierce and may turn violent; and second, that a deal may be struck to essentially dump AN as the hardline candidate if Khatami withdraws, likely leading to a compromise candidate entering the picture.  Supreme Leader Khamene'i has apparently thus far avoided any direct involvement in resolving this building confrontation.  As we have stated before, and continue to hear from multiple sources, a leading compromise candidate is former FM and current foreign policy advisor to the Supreme Leader, Ali Velayati.    2. [S/NF] Khatami-Era MFA Figures Active in Track II, Thinktank Outreach:  As noted in IRPO 76 and Istanbul 47, current and former Iranian MFA officials have shown signs of exploring surprisingly diverse venues and partners for their current round of Track II dialogues.  Many of the pragmatic MFA figures purged by Ahmadinejad in 2005/2006 have passed the past few years on Tehran's quasi-official foreign policy think tank circuit. Among their recent/current projects are: Track II dialogue in December 2008 in Athens, including cordial interactions between Iranian and Israeli participants; a planned Track II dialogue in Dubai at an Emirati defense think tank; various publications on Iranian diplomacy, including an excellent website www.irdiplomacy.ir, a book-length history of Iranian diplomacy, and a planned English-language quarterly, The Iranian Review of Foreign Affairs, set to debut in winter 2009.  Among the figures closely involved with these ventures are former PermRep Javad Zarif, former Ambassador to Afghanistan Reza Bahrami, Professor Kazem Sajjadpour of the MFA's School of International Relations and many others displaced by AN.  Dr. Sajjadpour is the main figure in the Dubai Track II plans, as well as a participant or supporter of several US-Iran nonofficial exchange programs. Comment: In discussions with members of this group, they offer practical and realistic insight into Iran's foreign policy goals and interests.  We are unable to assess their level of influence within the Leader's Office, the Supreme National Security Council, and other key foreign policy institutions.  They must, however, have powerful patrons to carry out the broad-ranging, sometimes controversial, and quite public work they do.    3. [S/NF] IRIG Defense Minister Visits Moscow: Iranian Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar is currently in Moscow, hoping to finalize arrangements for Russian delivery of S-300 air defense systems to Iran, according to Russian press reports. Najjar is scheduled to meet Russian Defense Minister Serdyukov on Feb. 17.  Comment: The apparent lack of candor by senior Russian officials in recent discussions with USG officials about the S-300 issue (Moscow 357, 372, 373), together with Najjar's visit, may portend developments on this matter in coming days.    4. [S/NF] UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Stresses Time Is of the Essence:  FCO Iran Team (working level) told visiting IRPO Deputy Director and London IW that HMG believed that time was running short to reach agreement with Iran over its nuclear activities.  Noting that the Administration's policy review was underway, FCO officials said U.S. engagement could be decisive in bringing the IRIG to the negotiating table.  In their view,  DUBAI 00000084  002.2 OF 003   prolonged negotiations, i.e. into next year, would give Iran sufficient time to reach a point of no return in being able to build a weapon, however.  Our interlocutors said that the P5+1 also needed to come to consensus on tougher sanctions should Iran not suspend its enrichment program and should be prepared to "preview" those sanctions to the IRIG.  FCO also raised the idea of the U.S. engaging more reticent members of the EU to push for their agreement on stronger sanctions.  Comment: Our interlocutors, without saying so explicitly, seemed anxious for a U.S. decision to engage Iran, but gently cautioned that the U.S. should not allow the Iranians to engage in a protracted bilateral negotiation at the expense of the P5+1 process.    5. [C] "Talking to Iran" Conference: The Feb. 12 "Talking to Iran" conference in London offered diverse views on when, how, and with whom to engage Iran but without much consensus how best to reach or influence Iranian audiences.  Opinions among the journalists, commentators, academics, and members of London's Iranian diaspora were split over the role and effectiveness of Western broadcasting services in reaching Iran from outside. Speakers debated whether VOA, BBC and others should be aimed at advocacy or traditional, factual reporting.  Likewise, there were differing opinions on the media environment inside Iran, ranging from government suppression and censorship to a vibrant, albeit semi-underground, public debate in traditional and emerging media.  Comment: Two themes resonated with us during the conference and in a separate tour of BBC Persian's newsroom.  First, a large segment of the Iranian population feels vilified by Western reporting on the country. Second, based on comments BBC Persian is receiving from its audience and in listening to observers who follow Iranian media, Iranians want to feel they are part of the discussion on issues that affect them personally.  As one speaker put it succinctly, "You should be talking with Iranians, not to them."    6. [S/NF] Swiss Diplomat Story Leaked by MOIS: An Iranian employee of the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran explained that the story surrounding the arrest of a Swiss diplomat posted to the USINT was leaked to the Iranian press by an MOIS employee. According to the USINT employee, the diplomat was briefly detained by security agents 18 months ago and then released. The incident was not publicized until (FNU) Husseini, director of the MOIS office that oversees the USINT, felt the need to highlight his own professional accomplishments after learning he might be removed from his position.  Comment: Leaking stories either for personal or political ends is just as prevalent in Iran as anywhere.  This is worth considering as we assess Iranian media reports purporting to reflect IRIG intentions and policies.  The above story is another reminder that various actors inside Iran will use leaks as needed - regardless of potentially counterproductive impact - if they perceive their core interests are at stake.    7. [S/NF] Staple Food Prices Head Down in Advance of Election: The Iranian USINT employee in Tehran also reported that prices of basic goods in Iran had fallen dramatically in the past two months.  The price of a chicken had been 5,500 tomans (about $5.75); it is now 1,500 tomans.  The price of rice has dropped from 6-7,000 tomans/kilo to 1,500 tomans/kilo.  He attributed the price drop to Ahmadinejad's electoral maneuvering, commenting that Ahmadinejad is clearly trying to appeal to his base.  Iranian visa applicants in Dubai - a demographic generally outside of Ahmadinejad's base - offered a mixed assessment of food prices.  Although a couple applicants said that rice and chicken prices had dropped, others thought prices were the same.  Comment:  Commodity prices are an important issue among Iranian voters, especially those Ahmadinejad is courting, and Ahmadinejad could benefit by manipulating the price.  At the same time, the allegation that Ahmadinejad is behind the price fluctuations may say as much about opinions toward Ahmadinejad and rumor mongering among his detractors as it does about his role in the price drops.

REASON: 1.4 (a), (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Russia Reportedly Provides Iran Missile Technology for ICBM: An Iranian businessman with strong links to government/security circles through his status as former IRGC commander in Khuzestan and former senior official for the Bonyad-e Shahid told IRPO on February 22 that the Russians provided Iranian defense minister Najjar a "kit" for evaluation and construction of a missile with a 7,000 mile range during his visit last week to Moscow.   [Note: The two Russian missiles with this range are the SS-25 Sickle and the SS-27 Topol, both three-stage single warhead missiles designed at the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology and entering into service in 1988 and 1998 respectively.  Both can be deployed on mobile launchers.]  IRPO Officer asked contact why he thought the Russians would provide Iran with such a dramatically destabilizing technology.  He replied that "clearly, the Russians are looking to the US to provide them some major concessions" - purportedly to halt further diplomatic and security support for Iran.  Comment: Najjar reportedly wanted to finalize the deal for S-300 air defense missiles during the visit, and this other technology may be a consolation.  IRPO is unable to confirm the accuracy of this contact's claims, but is compelled to report this disturbing allegation.    2. [S/NF] IRPO Contact Reports on Meeting with Khatami: A well-established IRPO contact with direct access to the reformist camp (both Khatami and Karroubi) provided a detailed readout of his meeting last week with former President Khatami. Highlights follow:    What Supreme Leader Khamenei Told Khatami: During the widely reported meeting between the SL and former president Khatami in late January, the SL told Khatami that in his opinion, Khatami should not run for President because it would not be good for the country.  If Khatami chose to run and was elected, however, as directed in the Constitution, the Supreme Leader would work with him.    Mousavi To Join Race to Bolster Reformist Chances: Former PM Mir Hossein Mousavi will formally declare his candidacy; in large part to deflect some hardline pressure off former president Khatami, but also to back him up should Khatami withdraw (either voluntarily or otherwise) from the race.  If Khatami survives the vetting process, then Mousavi will step aside in support of the former president.    Office of First Vice President Will Gain Increased Powers, Candidates Will Reportedly Run on President-VP Tickets:  Khatami reportedly divulged IRIG plans for a change to the office of the First Vice President under the next government.  Under this plan, the office  will enjoy increased powers, more in line with the role of a Prime Minister or the US Vice President.  Khatami has selected Moussavi as his first VP, and Karroubi has selected former Tehran Mayor Karbashchi in this capacity.  These duos will reportedly run on two-man tickets as in US elections.  It is not clear if AN will run on a ticket with Dr. Parviz Davoudi, his first VP.    Khatami Requests USG Help to Arrange Meeting with Swiss Ambassador to Iran: To help offset IRIB's broad support for AN's candidacy, and after the IRIG blocked his two main campaign websites, Khatami is seeking outlets to raise his media profile in advance of the election.  Along these lines, he has asked if Department can facilitate a meeting between Khatami and Swiss Ambassador to Tehran, Livia Agosti. Such a meeting would allow Khatami to highlight his international appeal (a key AN weakness) and Khatami welcomed media coverage of the meeting by domestic and foreign media.  Should such a meeting be possible, IRPO contact has asked that he be entrusted to deliver this message to Khatami.     DUBAI 00000094  002.2 OF 003   3. [S/NF] Drug Interdiction Cooperation on Afghanistan as Counternarcotics - Not Political - Breakthrough:  In discussions with Drug Enforcement Agency reps at ConGen Dubai, IRPO has learned that many narcotics investigations could be greatly enhanced by coordinating information sharing with Iranian counter-drug police.  DEA maintains many active leads that currently end in Iran - with even minimal coordination these leads could lead to major progress in USG efforts to fight narcotrafficking in the region.  Comment: Such an initiative would boost CT indirectly and help stabilize Afghanistan, by curtailing a key source of revenue for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  Beyond any bilateral political issues involved, US-Iran counternarcotics cooperation, or more accurately, incorporating Iran into regional CN programs, would likely greatly increase their effectiveness.    4. [C] Iran's Disaffected Youth So Far Tuned Out of Election: An Iranian journalist told us that the majority of Iranian youth are not likely to be politically active during the upcoming presidential campaign.  Many are resigned to the fact that Khatami's candidacy, nor much else, is likely to change the current system.  Most believe that Supreme Leader Khamenei will choose the next president, and therefore Iran's youth - a generation beset with unemployment, increasing repression, and isolation - have become apathetic and disaffected.  He estimated about 10 to 20 percent of Iran's students are members of the Basij, but only a small percentage of them are ideologically driven.  For others, Basij membership is a way to improve chances of gaining university admission or advancement.  He also said that at the other extreme, the hopelessness that many young people feel is leading to dramatic increases in drug addiction and other wanton behavior. Comment:  Although many pin their hopes on youthful activists to spearhead a reformist campaign, if the majority of those under 25 have consigned themselves to the status quo, then the reformists have already lost a key constituency.    5. [S/NF] Reformist journalists, bloggers under pressure:  The journalist, who is coming to the U.S. to work on a U.S.-based, Iranian news website, told us that the closure of Kargozaran and Hamshahri's evening edition and the arrests or interrogations of various bloggers by the IRIG has had a chilling effect among reformist newspapers.  Most reform-oriented publications lack the political connections to protect themselves.  The paper Etemad-e Melli is operating only because current presidential candidate and the paper's publisher Mehdi Karroubi, had the clout to resist the IRIG, he said.  As a case in point, our 25-year-old interlocutor has chosen not to return to Iran while waiting to receive his U.S. visa, for fear he would not be allowed to leave the country again.  Comment: The IRIG's tactics of arrest, intimidation and indirect threats, including the recent creation of a special prosecutor to deal with Internet and text message "character assassination," have had the desired effect in restraining many otherwise critical voices as a prelude to election campaigns beginning in earnest.    6. [S/NF] Speculation on Reasons Denying Visas for the U.S. Women's Badminton Team: Two IRPO contacts offered their assessments of the IRIG's decision not to issue visas to the U.S. women's badminton team earlier this month.  An Iranian LES at USINT in Tehran, who was in Dubai to pick up his visa, told us that the Department's announcement of the trip and subsequent international press coverage had "politicized" the trip in the eyes of some senior Iranian officials, who saw it as a direct challenge from the U.S. that required a tough response.  He recommended that future sports diplomacy programs be handled discretely, without publicity.  Another contact told us that he believed that some Iranian officials had worried that the trip, already receiving positive coverage, would become  a PR nightmare for Islamic Republic.  Coverage of U.S. athletes being embraced by Iranian crowds, as U.S. wrestlers had been, on the thirtieth anniversary of the Islamic Revolution was not the image the IRIG wanted to convey. Comment: Both of these explanations likely factored into the decision not to issue the visas.  What is clear, however, is that the decision was made at high levels in the IRIG after a preliminary decision to issue  DUBAI 00000094  003.2 OF 003   the visas had been made.    7. [S/NF] Powerful Support for US-Iran Exchanges: The Iranian employee of USINT told us separately that in querying various contacts in and out of the IRIG about possible future travel of American exchange visitors to Iran, he had heard from Yasser Rafsanjani, the youngest son of Expediency Council Chair Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, that Islamic Azad University was willing to host these exchanges and to provide the necessary political cover for them.  Comment: This information corroborates a separate source's information that Rafsanjani and Islamic Azad were receptive to the idea of working with USG and IRPO on various exchange and outreach programs.    8.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Reformist MP Khoeni On Past and Present of Reform Movement:    PAST: Former Reformist parliamentarian Mohammad Mousavi Khoeni [strictly protect], who served in the Sixth Majles (2000-2004), met with IRPO on March 1 and 3.  Mousavi Khoeni entered the Majles from a leadership position in the Office for Consolidating Unity, Iran's oldest and largest student organization.  Himself coming from an IT background, during his Majles tenure he played a central role in establishing (through enabling legislation and funding) Iran's broadband internet infrastructure (without opposition early on as IRIG regulators did not realize what terms like "ADSL" appearing in relevant legislation even meant).  Later, when the Supreme Leader's Office learned of the implications of such wide internet access, and acted to curtail its growing impact, the genie was already out of the bottle and Iran's entry into cyberspace could only be slowed, but not stopped.  As a former political prisoner himself, Khoeni also led Majles efforts to reform Iran's prisons, particularly those sites holding political prisoners. In particular, he discovered that the IRGC, MOIS, LEF, and Ministry of Justice, all maintained secret prisons where prisoners were held incognito and without charges, and demanded that the Majles have access to these sites.  In addition to reforming practices in the notorious MOIS "209" section of Evin Prison, (which houses high profile political prisoners), his efforts led to the closing of the "Towhid" prison, a large secret facility adjacent to the MFA building in Tehran.  He added that his work uncovered that several government bodies maintained secret prison sites within Evin prison, with the IRGC's being by far the most sensitive (not even the prison warden or officials from Department of Corrections were admitted).    PRESENT: Khoeni was clearly proud of these initiatives, and the work of the Sixth Majles which had accomplished much he said, but concluded that the Reformists had ultimately failed to meet the huge popular expectations that swept them to power.  "We tried working within the system for eight years, but in the end it was inadequate".  At this point, he thinks reformists are only "wasting time" working with the system as currently structured, although he still supports their efforts in principle.  While he does not actively support Khatami's candidacy, he supports active reformist participation in the June 2009 presidential election.  During the campaign period, he explained, groups - such as women's rights organizations for example - have been traditionally granted considerable leeway to express their often controversial positions with relative impunity.  What is really needed to bring real and lasting reform, he said, was to modify the institutions of the Islamic Republic, (but not, he emphasized, through regime change).  To make the required changes, he noted, the reformists need to build up a power base outside the government.  This is difficult, he lamented, as they continue to lack media access beyond the internet.  During the Sixth Majles, this lack of media access limited the reformists' ability to publicize their successes, and allowed their opponents to portray their tenure, and President Khatami's, both at the time and subsequently, in a negative light.  [Note: Such tactical manipulation of media access by hardliners was also cited recently by another IRPO contact, who suggested that reformist presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi appeared three times on IRIB during recent 30th Anniversary broadcasts as a ploy to raise his profile and thereby draw support from the much more dangerous reformist candidate, Khatami.]    IRPO will include Mousavi-Khoeni's views on future directions of the Reformist Movement within a septel focused on this subject.    2. [S/NF] U. of Tehran Professor Offers Views on Academic Engagement, Track II: University of Tehran Political Science professor Dr. Saideh Lotfian spoke with IRPO about the current academic environment at UT and the challenges of remaining engaged internationally.  Lotfian has requested permission  DUBAI 00000109  002.2 OF 003   through the MFA Commission on US-Iran exchanges to attend a May conference at Princeton.  She recounted that she was the first person she knew of to actually observe this new requirement announced in October 2008 requiring Iranian academics and others to receive MFA clearance before attending a US program. Lotfian marveled that no one she spoke to regarding the request was actually aware of the new requirement, including the international affairs office that arranges UT attendance at such US programs.  In her opinion, this MFA effort does not represent a coordinated, top-down effort to stifle US-Iran exchanges, but is more likely an MFA effort to gain some control and visibility over such programs.  She recommended that increased transparency and some level of engagement regarding exchanges would help dispel anxieties over US motives.  Professor Lotfian noted that there are many officials formerly with the MFA teaching in her faculty (Law and Political Science) at UT or at the Center for Strategic Research (CSR), which is affiliated with the Expediency Council, which would be strongly supportive of greater engagement with their American counterparts.  Among these, she specifically cited Dr. (Ambassador) Ali Mousavian, Dr. (Ambassador) Javad Zarif, Dr. Sayyed Mohammad Marandi, and several others.  Dr. Lotfian noted Track II talks were another good way to enhance engagement.  Lotfian herself has participated in various Track II programs, including the Pugwash talks, and used them as an example for why greater transparency was important.  "Nothing stays secret long in Iran," she said, noting that even the secret Track II Pugwash talks were soon afterwards common knowledge in academic and government circles in Iran, including access to a full lists of all attendees.    3. [S/NF] Iran's Schizophrenic Approach to Public Diplomacy: The Hollywood delegation visiting Iran this week has been warmly received by Iranian film makers, but also met with an IRIG demand for a public apology for past cinematic insults to the Iranian nation.  This schizophrenic response is typical of the recent IRIG approach to exchanges. IRIG officials, including President Ahmadinejad, have called for more exchanges, especially Americans visiting Iran, and the Iranian state media have highlighted American visitors, like U.S. journalists invited to a recent seminar or the award given by the Ministry of Science to three U.S. academics in December.  Contrast that with the harassment of a National Academy of Sciences official at the same time or obstruction of USG-sponsored exchanges, and Iran's attitude toward them is ambiguous at best.  An Iranian oncologist nominated for a breast cancer awareness IVLP last fall told us this week that it was the Ministry of Health that forced her to cancel her participation, after the Ministry of Intelligence and Security had approved the group's trip to the U.S.  Comment: The overriding conclusion we can draw is that Iranian officials will continue to see any USG involvement in exchanges, at least for now, as a threat to the regime.  At the same time, those that take place under the control of the IRIG are likely simply opportunities to promote Iran's "good will" and counter negative press.  We would add that much of this is for domestic consumption. But there is also the problem of Iran's decentralized intelligence and security services, which as the experience of the oncologist shows, often do not coordinate and have different interpretations on what is permissible.    4. [S/NF] Update on StarTV Persia Project: StarTV executives told us that their Farsi One channel will begin broadcasting to Iran in early April.  Dubai officials have given the project all required licenses and approvals, and they had voiced no further concerns, Star TV officials said. The channel will show U.S. and other entertainment programming, all dubbed in Farsi, and beamed to Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. They repeated their appreciation for USG support for the project and for weighing in with UAE officials. Comment: StarTV's channel will add to the Western-based alternatives to IRIB among Iranian viewers, further pressuring the state-controlled broadcaster and the IRIG to compete for viewers, and to worry about malign Western influences, like Bart Simpson.    5. [C] Ahmadinejad Raising Pensions to Win Over Voters?:  An Iranian journalist said President Ahmadinejad has doubled  DUBAI 00000109  003.2 OF 003   retired teachers' pension payments in a likely bid to garner support ahead of the presidential election in June.  The journalist's mother, a retired teacher, saw her pension rise from approximately $250 per month to $500 in the last few months.  Although the journalist-whose comments on other matters appeared in last week's WOI-does not know if Ahmadinejad's gambit will be successful, he suspects that retired teachers will at least have to think a bit harder about who to vote for in the election.  Comment: Coupled with reports from other IRPO contacts that Ahmadinejad increased subsidies for basic commodities, the journalist's comments suggest Ahmadinejad is trying to blunt the affect of Iran's economic downturn on his electoral prospects.  As Ahmadinejad's mismanagement of the economy will be a key issue in the election and a central tenet of attacks against him, the President appears to be trying to deliver needed financial relief and undermine his critics' attacks at the same time.    6. [S/NF] IRIG Failing To Pay Iranian Companies?:  An Iranian-American businessman just back from Iran told us that Iranian businessmen have recently started to face an additional obstacle: collecting what they are owed by the government.  He said Iranian companies doing business with IRIG, already lacking access to international credit, have incurred higher costs and demands for cash from sellers.  Now the IRIG is telling businesses providing some high-end equipment - like cell-phone networking infrastructure - that they were not going to be paid, according to our contact.  Comment: Our contact could not say how widespread this has become or whether it meant that elements within the IRIG were running short of cash but he did say that it was a recent phenomena and that he had heard of more than one example of it happening.    7.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Reformist MP Khoeni On Future of Reform Movement: Last week former MP (Sixth Majles) Moussavi Khoeni spoke about his experiences as a parliamentarian and his views on reformist participation in the upcoming presidential elections.  Turning now to his views on the future of the reformist movement in Iran, he noted that Supreme Leader Khamenei and Guardian Council head Ayatollah Jannati both referred to the Reformist period (1997-2005) as a "mistake" during meetings with Majles officials and had cautioned that "we won't make this mistake again". Khoeni was in Dubai applying for a student visa for graduate study in the US, and welcomed an opportunity to help the USG better understand the reformist trend, both in Dubai and if/when he comes to the US.  As noted previously, Khoeni does not support Khatami, but is aiming for "three or four" years down the road, when he suggests Abdollah Nouri would be the best candidate to lead a resurgent reformist movement.  [Nouri, a mid-ranking cleric, was Minister of Interior under Khatami, but was dismissed and ultimately imprisoned for five years for challenging the validity of the velayat-e faqih.]   During the next three-four years, Khoeni  hopes to help build up a revived reformist movement from the grassroots, apparently from outside Iran.    2. [S/NF] The Role of the US in the Future of Reformism in Iran: Moussavi Khoeni offered as assessment of what role the US can play in the future of the reform movement.  While he welcomed the participation of international organizations in the reformists' quest to establish human rights and the rule of law in Iran, he cautioned that "strong outside pressure" would not help.  "Such pressure may be able to change the regime, but will not be able to effectively administer what comes after it." Rather, the international community should, he continued, "bring pressure on areas the people need help".  He cited human rights as a priority, and added that "Democrats need to affirm their commitment to human rights in Iran".  He felt that international broadcasting could play an important role, but noted VOA as currently set up was too one-sided and remote from realities inside Iran to be relevant.  He cautioned against relying for editorial direction on VOA staff that have been away from Iran for decades and lack understanding of today's realities.  He suggested that VOA engage in greater direct dialogue with the Iranian people about issues in a more "professional" manner. They should not present every issue in "digital" terms, he said.  [Note: As an IT specialist by training, he explained that he meant to avoid 1/0 or black/white analysis.]  He suggested VOA should allow broader debate of viewpoints, like Al Jazeera. This he added, would remove the stigma facing those who appeared on VOA, which rendered even highly credible Iranians who appeared on VOA into "stooges of the US."  Finally, Khoeni noted that sanctions should be better targeted to hurt the IRIG, not the Iranian people.    3. [S/NF] Comment: Mousavi Khoeni's advocacy for Abdollah Nouri, who is a leading advocate in Iranian politics for abolishing the Velayat-e Faqih, as a reformist standard bearer in the near future suggests that at least some reformists are looking to advance major structural changes to Iran's political system, including targeting the top of the power structure for major reform/elimination.  Meanwhile, Khatami, who has also, according to previous IRPO reporting, has reportedly abandoned his support for the institution of the velayat-e faqih, continues to serve as the reformists' best near term prospect of a return to prominence.  Given Rafsanjani's well-known plans to replace the velayat with a ruling council, it appears the reformists have a strong consensus on this core issue - the institution of the Supreme Leader (at least as currently constituted) must go.    4. [S/NF] Iran Seeks Security Agreement, Greater Transport Links with Afghanistan: During a recent encounter with a senior Afghan government official transiting Dubai, IRPO Officer learned that Iran is seeking a security partnership agreement with Afghanistan, which would include a specific provision that "Afghan territory would not be used to launch any attack on Iran."  He added that Iran raised this issue immediately after  DUBAI 00000115  002.2 OF 003   Afghanistan concluded a security agreement with the US.  (Note: The parallels to the US-Iraq SOFA/SA are striking.)  This official also noted that Iran is looking to greatly enhance its transport ties with Afghanistan, and plans to invest 20 billion USD over the next five years to develop its large blue water port facilities at Chah Bahar on the Sea of Oman.  [Note: The Chah Bahar Port/Free Zone is the main port facility where goods bound for transport to Afghanistan and Central Asia enter Iran. Such shipments would be greatly facilitated through the 2008 inauguration of the India-Iran Chah Bahar - Zaranj - Delaram highway project linking the Afghan ring road to the Indian Ocean.]  Finally, this official the Afghans and Iranians are discussing a road project to link Herat directly to Kabul through the Hazara region.    5. [S/NF] Does a Television Monopoly Help of Hurt Ahmadinejad?: An IRPO contact who is heavily involved in the Star TV Farsi project offered some analysis of the Iranian media market and IRIB.  He said that the conventional wisdom predicts that IRIB's constant, positive coverage of Ahmadinejad will help his electoral campaign.  He noted, however, IRIB's packaging of the president is unsophisticated propaganda.  He suggested that many Iranian viewers will see it for what it is, and it may reinforce their negative perception of Ahmadinejad's mismanagement of the economy.   Although the Star TV project is exclusively entertainment programming and may not represent the ideological challenge to the IRIG of VOA or BBC Persian, our contact said the IRIG may feel threatened by it for other reasons.  He explained that IRIB generates USD 200 to 300 million in advertising and other revenue for the government.  Star TV's backers believe that they can attract some of those advertisers away from IRIB, cutting into its revenue.  If they succeed, and hurt IRIB financially, then the IRIG may try to retaliate, he said.  Comment: Media access will be a defining feature of the presidential campaign, and no candidate is likely to get as much television coverage as Ahmadinejad.  We agree with our interlocutor's assessment that extensive coverage that tries to conceal his failing economic policies may backfire.    6. [S/NF] Mixed Signals on Hollywood Delegation's Visit:  The visit of an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) delegation has prompted some curious recriminations within the IRIG over who authorized the delegation to visit Iran. Ahmadinejad's art advisor and other officials demanded an apology for Hollywood's insults to Iran and the conservative daily Kayhan asserted that the visit had the same ill intent as USG-sponsored exchange programs.  The visit generally received positive press coverage in Iran and culminated in Annette Benning and the others from Hollywood being named honorary members of the Iranian House of Cinema.  This week, MPs summoned the ministers of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence and Security on March 8 to answer questions on who invited the group and issued them visas during a period of "cultural onslaught," according to one MP.  He criticized officials for not scrutinizing the purpose of the visit closely enough.  Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi defended the visit as completely legal. Comment: As our recent experience shows, the IRIG is strictly vetting any visits with some connection to the U.S. Despite the public criticism of Hollywood's treatment of Iran, however, there was sufficient support within the IRIG from behind the scenes for this visit to go forward. This episode reinforces our view that exchanges with the U.S. remain a highly factionalized issue within the IRIG but that under the right conditions, i.e. no obvious USG connection and devoid of any political overtones, they can go forward.    7. [C/NF] Majles Rejects Ahmadinejad's Cash Handouts: On March 8th the Majles voted to remove the clause in the government's proposed Economic Reform Plan that would have redistributed subsidies on fuel, water and electricity as cash handouts to low-income Iranians.  According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, under the plan some 70% of families would have been eligible to receive $80 per month on average in direct  DUBAI 00000115  003.2 OF 003   cash payments.  Comment:  Ahmadinejad has made the Economic Reform Plan and its goal of replacing subsidies with direct payments to needy families key elements of his promise to both reduce the economy's dependence on oil exports and to provide "economic justice" to lower and working-class Iranians.  The Majles' rejection of his cash payment plan will force the president to find other ways to appeal to lower-income voters, who make up his base.  The decision also casts in doubt the timing of the removal of subsidies, since the government will have to come up with another way to offset the steep rise in prices for consumers.    8. [C] Iranians Booking Fewer Visa Appointments in Dubai:  The online booking system for visa appointments in Dubai has availability throughout March and into April - a rarity in recent memory.  The consulate has been offering 170 visa appointments per day to Iranians and, until the last two weeks, applicants had booked every opening soon after becoming available.  The total number of incoming applicants is also down.  Last year, 1,411 applicants applied for visas between 11 February and 10 March; this year 1,044 applied during the same time frame (Only a portion of those with an appointment appear at the consulate for an interview; the figures cited refer to those actually appearing).  Comment: IRPO Conoff queried a few applicants regarding whether the visa application process has become harder recently; none mentioned anything accounting for the decrease.  The drop may be temporary and may relate to the Iranian New Year (March 21), but Norouz in past years has not coincided with such a drop.    9.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [C/NF] Iranian Visa Applicants in Dubai Generally Unenthusiastic About Mir Hossein Mousavi:  IRPO Conoff queried visa applicants regarding their views of former Iranian Prime Minister and now presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. None professed particular enthusiasm with his candidacy and younger applicants, especially students, knew little about him. Others were inclined to dismissively lump Mousavi with other Iranian politicians.  Of those offering distinct opinions, a young, female Iranian doctor disapproved of his candidacy because she believes the Supreme Leader supports it.  A middle-aged chemist conditioned his support for Mousavi on Khatami's endorsement and, finally, a Tehrani gold jeweler applauded Mousavi's management of the country during the Iran-Iraq war, contrasting that era with the current reality. Comment:  Iranians visa applicants in Dubai are as a group apolitical and their general lack of enthusiasm for a presidential candidate is not surprising.  That students and Iran's youth know little about Mousavi is also unsurprising - such demographic groups came of age after Mousavi's generally well regarded stint as prime minister in the 1980s.  Still, if their views are representative of other young Iranians, attracting their support will be a key challenge for Mousavi. The notion that Khamenei supports Mousavi's bid is odd - the two were rivals in the 1980s-and further suggests that Mousavi is now relatively unknown.    2. [S/NF] Iranian Government and Tehran Municipality's Interest in US Agricultural Trade:  Based upon discussions with Dubai-based Regional Ag Attache, IRPO has learned that Iran's Government Trading Corporation (GTC) has been in touch with the US Wheat Council regarding proposed travel by several senior officials to visit US wheat producing areas and to explore further bulk grain purchases from the US.  [Note: According to USDA, the GTC purchased $535 million of US wheat in 2008 and continues to purchase US wheat.  Iran's new fiscal year budget allows for greater wheat imports this year.  At present, trade sources indicate Iran is purchasing $15-20 million of US wheat per month]. IRPO Officer met with two UAE-based Iranian traders who claimed to represent the Municipality of Tehran and its interest in purchasing American agricultural products.    The UAE-based traders were unfamiliar with last year's trade or with the licensing procedures and requirements for US trade with Iran, but emphasized that their purchases are separate from those of the GTC.  The Tehran Municipality's shopping list of American products includes wheat, corn, barley, rice, and citrus fruits.  Comment:    Intermittent droughts in Iran, such as in 2008, have historically raised demand for agricultural imports, but the choice of US origin agricultural goods may indicate an Iranian (GTC and the Tehran Municipality) decision to explore expanded trade opportunities with the US.  Future discussions in the US with USDA and/or private agricultural firms may clarify their motivation for selecting US agricultural commodities.    3. [S/NF] Roxana Saberi's Arrest Likely Organized by Spoilers to Prevent U.S.-Iran Rapprochement.  In separate conservations, two highly regarded Iranian-American political analysts who both know Saberi personally, described her as "completely benign" and were highly skeptical that anything about her life or work in Iran had led to her arrest.  Both men cautioned against allowing spoilers to derail plans for engagement, recalling how the January 2002 seizure of the Palestinian freighter Karine A loaded with presumably Iranian-made weapons was likely the point at which the confidence built between the U.S. and Iran during the 2001 Bonn Conference began to disintegrate.  One of the contacts described Saberi, because of her dual nationality as well as the fact that she was not working directly for a prominent international news outlet, as ideal "low-hanging fruit" for security officials trying to thwart the possibility of dialogue between Washington and Tehran.    4. [S/NF] The Lion Rising?:  Iranian Identity and Hubris in the Northern Emirates: A well-established IRPO business contact recounted the following anecdote to IRPO Officer from  a banking leadership meeting he attended in Ajman emirate last week. During the Q&A session, an Egyptian attendee rose and requested  DUBAI 00000121  002.2 OF 002   to ask his question in Arabic as his English was weak and suggested a colleague could translate.  A Bank Melli - Iran official immediately rose and declared that "if he is allowed to ask his question in Arabic, I should be allowed to ask mine in Farsi, and he (pointing to an Ajman government official attending the meeting) can translate for me."  The government official was reportedly taken aback, but the meeting eventually wrapped up without major incident.  Comment: The presence of Emirati-Iranian officials throughout the UAEG and all levels of business, particularly in the Northern Emirates, is a deeply sensitive matter rarely discussed openly in the UAE.  Within the context of potential UAE-Iran bilateral tension, questions of cultural identity may sharpen.  The Bank Melli official's claim that Farsi be treated equally to Arabic in an official meeting, and his use of a Farsi-speaking government official to bolster his position, is a thought-provoking example of the very real battle for influence and identity in the Gulf.    5. [S/NF ] Test Case for Subsidy Reform Not a Hit:  IRPO Officer met with Hassan Kabiri, a scion of a prominent bazaari family and managing director/owner of Paknam, one of Iran's largest producers of detergent powder.    Kabiri discussed Iran's reduction of price subsidies for detergent powder in 2008, claiming that detergent had subsequently tripled in price but that President Ahmadinejad had simultaneously reduced tariffs on imported detergent from 35 to 20%.  The tariff reduction was the President's attempt to fight the inflationary impact of the price increase, but in Kabiri's estimation this effort had been a failure.   Kabiri's factory was adjusting to the new economic reality by trying to lower its fixed costs, primarily by reducing the labor force.  Paknam had laid off about half of its approximately 1,000 workers since the subsidy reduction, but Iran's legal code made this process extremely difficult--one laid off employee had even appealed his case to Iran's Supreme Court.  Kabiri found it easier to lay off workers if he first made provisions for their post-employment welfare.  Looking forward to Iran's new fiscal year that starts later this month, Kabiri predicted that the government will have to reverse course and raise tariffs on non-food items, including detergent, so that it can continue to pay for food imports as oil revenues decline.  Comment:  The removal of price subsidies and a reduced tariff for imports highlight some of the dangers that AN's economic transformation plan poses to Iran's domestic producers and their employees.  The recent defeat of AN's subsidy reforms during the debate over next year's budget in the Majles will delay significant changes, but Iran's massive subsidies remain a key burden on government finances and a distortion in Iran's economy.    6.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000122  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/17/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KDEM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN'S ELECTION - KHATAMI DEPARTS, MOUSAVI ENTERS TO CHALLENGE AHMADINEJAD  DUBAI 00000122  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.  (C/NF) Summary:  Former president Khatami's decision to withdraw from Iran's upcoming presidential race in favor of former Prime Minister Mousavi will help consolidate the moderate vote, strengthening the challenge to Ahmadinejad.  Mousavi, following a twenty-year absence from Iran's political scene, is hoping to capitalize on his sterling revolutionary credentials and reputation as an honest, effective manager.  Khatami's endorsement should increase his visibility, particularly among voters too young to remember Mousavi's tenure as prime minister during the 1980s.  Mousavi, though embraced by the reformist camp, appears to be emphasizing competence, personal integrity, and a promise to adhere to the country's laws and constitution rather than running in order to further a particular ideological agenda.  Though his election would likely portend greater social freedom and a less confrontational presentation of Iran to the outside world, he has stated that he remains firmly committed to defending Iran's "sovereignty" and lauds the country's "irreversible accomplishments" in nuclear technology as a prime example of the Islamic Revolution's righteousness.  Iranian elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and key elements - including the final list of candidates and the effect of Mousavi's historically contentious relationship with Supreme Leader Khamenei - remain unclear.  However, it is reasonable to surmise that a Mousavi candidacy actively supported by Khatami will present a formidable challenge to Ahmadinejad, whose grip on power seemingly rests on Khamenei's support.  End summary.    2.  (C/NF)  Former president Mohammad Khatami announced his withdrawal from the race for Iran's tenth presidential election with a March 17 statement on his campaign website Yaari News in which he also pledged to support former prime minister Mir Hussein Mousavi, who publicly announced his own candidacy March 10.  By exiting the race, Khatami is making good on earlier pledges to reduce the number of viable reformist candidates so as to avoid splitting the moderate vote.  While the reasoning behind his decision is currently subject to robust speculation across Iran's political spectrum, the move undoubtedly reflects Khatami's personal ambivalence about running for office again and his determination to see incumbent President Ahmadinejad defeated.    3.  (C/NF)  Whatever the rationale, Khatami's withdrawal and subsequent endorsement will be a significant boon to Mousavi's candidacy, especially if Khatami is able to deliver substantial numbers of young voters to Mousavi.  The 67-year old former prime minister (1981-89) returned to public politics after a twenty-year absence March 10 by officially announcing his candidacy for Iran's tenth presidential election with a promise to return Iran to the "pure Islamic values" envisioned by former Supreme Leader Khomeini.  While little is known about Mousavi's current views on specific policy issues, he is generally favorably regarded, especially by older Iranians who remember him as an honest, capable manager during the Iran-Iraq War.  As a result of his long absence from the public political scene however, he lacks the name recognition of Khatami or incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, particularly among Iran's youth. (Note: The minimum voting age in Iran is 15.  Voters between 15 and 30 years of age comprise about half of the country's eligible voters.)    4. (C/NF)  Admirers of Mousavi claim that his withdrawal from political life in 1989  further burnished his image among many Iranians, who view him as "untainted" and "uncorrupted" in comparison with many contemporary political figures who are seen as having personally profited from their government positions. He is also admired by older Iranians who remember his willingness to stand up to now Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khameini, who served as president during much of Mousavi's tenure as prime minister.  Numerous IRPO contacts have been quick to draw this distinction between Khatami and Mousavi, contrasting the former president's perceived weakness vis-`-vis Khamenei and other hardline elements of the regime with the collective memory of Mousavi's willingness as prime minister to challenge and/or circumvent then-president Khamenei.   DUBAI 00000122  002.2 OF 003     5. (C/NF)  In recent public comments, including a speech at the University of Tehran earlier this month and the announcement of his candidacy, Mousavi played up these attributes, signaling that his campaign will focus on his dated but proven record of managerial competence and personal integrity.  In a thinly veiled critique of Ahmadinejad, Mousavi assailed government officials prone to using "illegal means" and circumventing the country's laws and constitution to achieve their goals, no matter how well intentioned.  Not only are such actions a violation of public trust, he asserted while announcing his run for office, but also a "denial of common sense."  With such comments, Mousavi is attempting to capitalize on the increasingly loud chorus of critics of Ahmadinejad's management of the economy and alleged misappropriation of a billion dollars' worth of oil revenue, even from former allies in the Majles.    6. (C/NF)  Mousavi is also trying to undermine Ahmadinejad's appeal through "guilt by association" with repeated attacks on his previous and current interior ministers -- the former was forced from office for faking a doctoral degree from Oxford and the latter, former Revolutionary Guard Commander Sadeq Mahsouli, is known as the "billionaire general."  In an effort to highlight his own revolutionary credentials, in multiple recent public statements Mousavi has referenced his friendships with highly respected IRGC commanders killed during the Iran-Iraq War and contrasted their sacrifices with Mahsouli and others who have "abused their positions of public trust" to enrich themselves and their families at the expense of the Iranian people.  To further bolster his argument that he best represents the true values of the Islamic Revolution, he frequently draws attention to his humble lifestyle.  Supporters have been quick to highlight biographical details that illustrate Mousavi's "man of the people" appeal: he has lived in Naziabad, a poor district in South Tehran that was heavily bombarded by the Iraqis during the war, since the 1980s; after his tenure as prime minister he returned to private life as a painter and architect; none of his three children has tried to capitalize on their family name, etc.    7.  (C/NF)  Despite Mousavi's generally positive reputation, middle income and wealthy Iranians are quick to recall his war-time nickname "Mister Coupon" for the rationing system imposed during shortages in the 1980s.  Although Iranians opinion leaders generally speculate that his policy views have "evolved" since the revolutionary period, his recent statement include frequent references to the need to form a proper "Islamic economy," merging populist and socialist-like economics with national underpinnings in another direct challenge to Ahmadinejad for lower-income voters.  During a February press conference, Mousavi pointed to a "Buy America" clause in the U.S.'s economic stimulus package as an example of how governments should act in the national interest "even if the rules violate WTO safeguards."    8.  (C/NF)  Reformers have embraced Mousavi as one of their own, despite the fact that he was apparently not involved in the intellectual origins of the movement in the mid-90s.  A recent editorial in the reformist daily Etemad cited Mousavi's "belief in the supremacy of law" as the most important trait binding him to the reform movement.  Multiple IRPO contacts have cautioned against assuming that Khatami and Mousavi are ideologically interchangeable, however.  One well-established IRPO contact observed that while a Mousavi presidency would likely witness the return to an era of greater freedom of expression domestically and a less confrontational external approach, he is a staunch nationalist who remains committed to the goals of the Islamic Revolution as interpreted by Ayatollah Khomeini. Indeed, during the announcement of his candidacy Mousavi pointed to Iran's "irreversible achievements" in developing nuclear technology in the face of Western opposition as a prime example of Iran's ability to "succeed on its own."    DUBAI 00000122  003.2 OF 003    9. (C/NF)  Perhaps the most important unanswered question about Mousavi is the current state of his relationship with Supreme Leader Khamenei.  While the leader does not select the winner per se, he can exercise significant influence over the final outcome, particularly in a relatively close election. Conventional wisdom holds that Khamenei still harbors resentment of Mousavi from their unusually public political rivalry in the 1980s and would likely be unwilling to allow someone with the fortitude to challenge him attain the presidency.  Yet, despite his withdrawal from political life twenty years ago, Mousavi has been repeatedly appointed to the Expediency Council since 1989, an indication that while perhaps not an ally of Khamenei, he is still a member of the regime establishment and has not crossed any red-lines with the Supreme Leader.      10. (C/NF) Comment: Iranian elections are notoriously difficult to predict and internal maneuvering up to and through the Guardians Council vetting process in late May will no doubt alter the political landscape in advance of the June 12 election.  Khatami's withdrawal and endorsement of Mir Hussein Mousavi, however, provides a significant boost to the reform-oriented, moderate camp.  The reformers in 2005 were unable to unite behind a single candidate; if they can do so behind Mousavi, their electoral prospects would certainly increase. Khatami, if he campaigns for Mousavi, can help increase the former Prime Minister's name recognition among Iranian youth.  Mousavi too has impeccable revolutionary credentials and his past ties to Khomeini will make it difficult for the Guardian Council to reject his qualifications-a scenario IRPO contacts deem unlikely.  And Mousavi is clearly making a concerted effort to "out-Ahmadinejad" Ahmadinejad by blending economic populism, a return to "pure" Islamic values, fierce nationalism with his own record of competent management-an area where Ahmadinejad is vulnerable.    11. (C/NF) Comment (contd.): Still, Mousavi's candidacy faces several key challenges, not least of which is his poor relationship with Khamenei.  The Supreme Leader's continued support for Ahmadinejad, and reported opposition to Khatami's candidacy, suggests he wants a more pliable president in office.  And the reformist ranks still have two prominent candidates as Mehdi Karroubi has vowed to remain in the race, at least through the vetting process, which ends just two weeks before the election.  Karroubi came in third in the 2005 election and is also likely to campaign as an economic populist, raising the possibility that Karroubi and Mousavi will draw votes from one another. ASGARD 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000124  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/18/2019 TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: IRAN:  RELIGIOUS MINORITIES COMPLAIN OF IRIG DISCRIMINATION  DUBAI 00000124  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The IRIG has engaged in a distinct effort to separate minorities from the larger, Muslim society, according to members of Iran's Zoroastrian and Armenian Christian communities who recently spoke to IRPO.  Iran's efforts, seemingly intended to ensure that Iran is first and foremost a country for Muslims and that Muslims do not convert to other religions, have limited the minorities' engagement with the broader society. And although minorities reported few instances of overt discrimination from their countrymen, the IRIG's effort has had its consequences, including: emigration, economic disadvantage, and psychological hardship. The minorities dismissed the importance of their Majles representatives, were generally uninterested in the June presidential election, and pessimistic that their situation would soon improve. End Summary.    2. (C) IRPO officers spoke separately with two Armenian Christians and two Zoroastrians in late 2008 and early 2009.  Of the Armenian Christians, one lives in Tehran and owns a pizza restaurant while the other emigrated from Iran and lives in the UAE. Of the Zoroastrians, one lives in Shiraz and formerly chaired a Shiraz council of Zoroastrians, and the other is a housewife in Tehran.    Keeping Minorities "In a Box"    3. (C) Since the Revolution, Iran's religious minorities have perceived that the IRIG has set about separating the religious minorities from the majority, Shia population.  The Zoroastrian from Shiraz explained that Iran now is first and foremost a country for Muslims and religious minorities are constantly reminded of this reality.  For instance, all Zoroastrians carry a card identifying them as Zoroastrians.  Minority-owned restaurants have to be identified as such so Muslims can avoid eating there, if they choose.  The Zoroastrian housewife recounted a time when her son accompanied a Muslim friend into a mosque and thereafter received a letter instructing him to never do so again. Religious minorities are also pressured to prevent Muslims from converting.  The Zoroastrian from Shiraz said this pressure was the only overt interference from the government. As a result, they turn away all Muslims curious about their faith.    4. (C) The IRIG's employment restrictions are another element of the religious minorities' separation from the broader society; these restrictions also cause emigration from Iran.  The Zoroastrian housewife said Zoroastrians cannot become teachers or work in the military.  Additionally, she assumed that all government jobs were unavailable to Zoroastrians, though she was not sure. Her son immigrated to the US because he could not find work in Iran.  The Armenian Christian from the UAE said the poor economic prospects drive many minorities away from Iran.    5. (C) Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians' official recognition in the Iranian constitution does afford the minorities certain rights, such as the right to practice their religion, elect their own representatives to the Majles, and manage their own "personal affairs and religious education."  In practice, constitutional recognition does confer some privileges unavailable even to Muslims.  An Armenian Christian sports club, for instance, creates a "normal space" where men and women can socialize, women can be unveiled, and boys and girls can swim in a pool together. But these protections often reinforce their separation from the Muslim majority.  The sports complex further "isolates" Christians from the Muslims. Armenian schools use Armenian rather than Farsi and at home Armenians also speak their own language, resulting in a distinct accent when they speak Farsi, according to the Armenian Christian living in the UAE.    6. (C) Despite the regime's efforts, contact between the religious minorities and Muslims does continue, and the minorities reported few instances of discrimination from their countrymen.  The Armenian Christian pizza restaurant owner said 90% of his customers are Muslims-who, amusingly, rarely hesitate  DUBAI 00000124  002.2 OF 002   before ordering pork-based toppings for their pizza-but some do avoid the restaurant because it is run by non-Muslims.  (Note: Our contact said he acquiesces to such request for pork toppings but under no circumstances would he serve alcohol.  He said the punishment for serving alcohol would probably be a fine, six-month restaurant closure, and flogging.) The Armenian Christian living in the UAE claimed that just as many (possibly more) people eat at Armenian restaurants as a means of rejecting the government's attempt to isolate the community as choose to avoid the establishment for the same reason.    Pessimistic about the Future    7. (C) Our interlocutors were pessimistic that the conditions they face in Iran would change; they generally dismissed the importance of their representatives in the Majles and expressed little enthusiasm for the June presidential election.  The Zoroastrian from Shiraz complained that their Majles representative has little influence and that it was almost expected that he remain silent.  The Armenian Christian restaurant owner echoed the same point.  An acquaintance of Gevork Vartan, an Armenian Christian Majles member, said Vartan is trying to broaden his participation in general Majles activities to show that Armenian MPs can represent Iran and Iranians, not just the small Armenian Christian community.    8. (C) Iran's June presidential election also held little interest; even with former president Khatami in the mix. Although he had not yet declared his candidacy at the time of the conversation, the Zoroastrian housewife was not supportive of Khatami, explaining that he had not accomplished anything in his eight years as president. The Armenian Christian restaurant owner said he does not vote at all-a decision he described as a silent protest against the IRIG.  Of our interlocutors, only the Zoroastrian from Shiraz planned to vote.  And he votes, he said, out of fear the government will punish Zoroastrians if they do not participate in the election.  He offered a similar explanation for why he never speaks out against the injustices he sees-he doesn't want to create more trouble for Zoroastrians.  Similarly, leaders of the Armenian Christian community encourage voting in parliamentary election because they fear that if Armenian Christians do not participate, the IRIG will strip them of their Majles seats.    Comment:    9. (C) The Zoroastrian and Christian populations in Iran face fewer problems than Baha'is-a point our interlocutors were quick to make themselves.  And in many respects, the minorities' problems are not unique but are instead shared by all Iranians. Iranians of all stripes face economic challenges and emigrate to find better economic opportunities.  Iranians generally are also pessimistic about the future and do not expect to benefit from increased freedom or political rights with the current regime in place.  Still, the minorities are not on equal footing with their Muslim counterparts. The minorities have fewer avenues for employment and the IRIG has pushed the minorities to the side in favor of Shia Muslims.  But rather than push for greater rights and greater acceptance from the IRIG, the minorities have turned to silent protest and assimilation to avoid making their situation worse. And many simply leave Iran.  The Armenian Christian in the UAE said the most important factor motivating emigration is the sense that "Iran is paralyzed" and thus offers no opportunity or hope to young people.  The lack of hope-the sense that life is simply harder for minorities in Iran-was a constant refrain.  The minority populations will likely continue to dwindle via emigration or otherwise.  With an air of bitter resignation, the Armenian Christian restaurant owner explained that he and his wife do not have children because they do not want to raise kids in Iran's Muslim-first society.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Qalibaf Planning to Deliver US Goods in Time for Election?:  The Tehran Municipality's interest in US agricultural trade continues, but now appears driven by a more overtly political agenda.  IRPO Officer and Dubai-based regional Ag Attache met for a second time with two UAE-based Iranian traders representing the Tehran Municipality.  Following up on previous discussions of US wheat, the traders' new emphasis is now on rice and oranges, and they repeatedly emphasized the importance of having these products labeled "Made in USA" and to have them delivered before the June election, even if the size of the purchase is relatively modest.  The political nature of these purchases was further emphasized by the UAE-based traders effort to distinguish their purchases from those of the IRIG Ministry of Commerce's Government Trading Corporation (GTC), controlled by an AN appointee; the traders said the GTC would only be interested in expanded US trade if AN loses the election in June and a new director takes over the GTC.   Comment: The traders did not mention whether Tehran Mayor Qalibaf was involved in this proposed transaction.  Qalibaf, operating via the Tehran Municipality's procurement network, may plan to use this transaction of US-origin goods to position himself as someone who can deliver, in a material way, better Iran-US relations.  Numerous hurdles to completing the purchase and delivery before the elections remain, including US licensing procedures and the lack of a US-Iran phytosanitary agreement.    2. [C] Iran's Channel 3 Broadcasts Video Conflating USG Digital Outreach and Internet Porn Ring:  A well-established IRPO contact reported that on March 20 Iran's Channel 3 ran a report describing how intelligence agents of the Revolutionary Guard have broken up a network of internet sites supported by the USG.  According to the report, the Farsi-language pornography and prostitution sites were part of the State Department's efforts to foster a velvet revolution in Iran by promoting anti-revolutionary and anti-religious activities within Iranian society.  According to our contact, the video spliced together commentary from a narrator, taped confessions of several men arrested for running the sites, and clips of a young Iranian-American man with a Department of State seal in the background discussing USG digital outreach efforts.  Our contact noted that the report was aired at the beginning of the Nowruz holiday, just before a popular movie was scheduled to run, thus ensuring a large audience.    3. [C/NF] Hollywood Delegation Gets Rave Reviews: Two contacts have told us that contrary to official IRIG castigation of Hollywood, the delegation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was warmly received throughout Iran.  One Iranian film industry contact said that Hollywood recognition of the Iranian film community was, he hoped, a step toward new cooperative relationships between film makers in both countries.  IRIG officials were privately very supportive of the visit, our contacts said. They noted that there had been no direct or indirect effort to press the delegation for an "apology" and that the atmosphere surrounding the visit had been completely positive.  Comment: Iranian officials are no strangers to playing to foreign audiences when saying one thing and doing another.  The presence of these high-profile American visitors, "300" aside, has created enormous good will and new opportunities for supporting collaboration between U.S. and Iranian film makers at various levels.    4. [C/NF]  Iranians Appreciative Of and Talking about President Obama's Message:  Most Iranian visa applicants in Dubai on March 22 and March 24 were aware of President Obama's message and were very enthusiastic about it.  Some had seen the message on satellite television in Iran, but many had heard about the message from friends, family, or colleagues.  Young and old applicants alike offered their appreciation for the message and many hoped the speech would eventually yield a new relationship between Iran and the United States.  Fewer applicants were aware of the Supreme Leader's response to the President's message - though those that were either disappointed with its tone or unsurprised at the reaction.  One woman from Tehran, criticizing Khamenei, complained that a message of kindness should be  DUBAI 00000140  002.2 OF 002   reciprocated in kind.  Comment: Iranians seeking visas to visit the United States are probably predisposed to supporting the President and unlikely to criticize him during their visa interview.  Still, their comments are useful.  Many applicants had not seen or read the message themselves but had heard about it, suggesting the message was a popular topic of conversation. Most applicants were from Tehran, but those from other locations, such as Shiraz, Esfahan, and Arak also were aware of and supportive of the message.  And many applicants were visibly excited to be queried about the message and optimistic that better relations may be in the offing.    5. [C/NF] Iranians See Potential Opening in Khamenei's Mashhad Speech:  Several IRPO contacts, based both inside and outside Iran, observed that Western press characterizations of Supreme Leader Khamenei's March 21 speech as a rebuff or rejection of President Obama's Nowruz overture were oversimplified and incorrect.  Each contact noted a distinct change in Khamenei's tone and remarked that when the crowd began the usual "Death to America" chant, he stopped them, saying that this was not the time for slogans.  Our contacts, several of whom make a point of listening to every speech by the Leader, said this was unprecedented and a "clear signal" to Iranians that Khamenei recognizes the importance of this opportunity and does not want the moment to be obscured by the "usual political theater."  As one Tehran-based woman observed, "Iranians speak in nuance," and emphatically argued that Khamenei did not rebuff President Obama; rather, he said "you change, then we will change." (Note: This young woman, who is from a middle class, relatively religious family not supportive of Ahmadinejad, said she found President Obama's message "condescending" and that while "nice words are necessary, they are not sufficient."    6.

During a recent meeting with RAK leadership RAK, Barzani began speaking Persian with IRPO contact.  Barzani reportedly said in greeting, "We (Iranians and Kurds) are brothers of one shared root" to the Iranian.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Roxana Saberi: Iranian-Americans as Diplomatic Leverage : As IRPO has reported and will report further septel, various spoilers in Iran facing the prospect that improved US-Iran ties will erode their standing within Iran have taken deliberate and well-timed steps to preempt such improved ties. Over the past several months as prospects for improved US-Iran relations have surfaced, various elements of the Iranian security establishment have taken to arresting Iranian-Americans on vague or trumped up charges.  Considered Iranian citizens by the IRIG, and traveling to Iran on their Iranian passports as Iranian law forbids Iranians with another nationality from entering Iran on their non-Iranian passport, they are easy prey.  At least in the IRIG's estimation, the international outcry over an arrested Iranian-American will be less strident, making the diplomatic backlash less severe.  Finally, given the Iranian population's general ambivalence or even resentment towards exiled Iranians returning to Iran on missions to save the country after spending decades in comfortable exile, the IRIG knows there is likely to be little outcry within Iran on these cases.    2. [S/NF] For the IRIG, detained/arrested Iranian-Americans serve four valuable purposes: first, their interrogation and detention affords Iranian security services time to investigate their associations inside Iran, which often leads to other innocent but vulnerable targets, and  may also result in intelligence about their foreign links; second, their generally inexplicable treatment puts the brakes on too quick a reconciliation with the international community by both horrifying outside observers and intimidating indigenous pro-engagement and reformist forces;  third, the incarceration of innocent but influential Iranian-Americans chills others in similar circumstances from visiting Iran or associating with organizations involved in US-Iran issues; fourth, they serve as useful bargaining chips - primarily via releasing them as a gesture after concessions are wrung from the other side.  In some cases, however, they are cynically treated as pure grist for an exchange of cash or valued goods.    3. [S/NF] In the case of Roxana Saberi, she has now probably been detained long enough for the IRIG to check its leads, she has already made the necessary impression internationally and domestically, and her treatment has by now sufficiently chilled Iranian-Americans and others to steer clear of activism in Iran.  So what's left? The IRIG may now seek to use the release of Ms. Saberi, (and perhaps Esha Momeni who is still prohibited from leaving Iran), as a gesture to the US in exchange for or in response to US concessions.  Department's close monitoring of the Saberi case is valuable, not only because it will help an innocent and accomplished American rejoin her family, but also as the terms and timing of her release will provide a useful measure of IRIG receptivity to US-Iran engagement.    4. [S/NF]  Alaei Brothers Able to Receive Family Visits: According to a friend of the Alaei family, the doctors' mother is able to make "regular," albeit brief, visits to her sons, who are serving their prison sentences in solitary confinement in Tehran's Evin Prison.  The mother reports that the brothers are held in separate cells, but are within earshot of each other. Although Arash and Kamiar are not permitted to see or speak with each other, the mother said they reassure each other daily that neither has been moved to a different location by singing loudly in Kurdish.    5. [C/NF]  AN's Defeated Subsidy Plan May Still Lure Some Voters:  A well-established IRPO contact relayed a conversation he recently had in Tehran with several members of the cleaning staff of a large consulting firm, all of whom expressed their intent to support Ahmadinejad in hopes that a second term would allow him to fulfill his plan of giving cash payments to lower-income Iranians.  As one of the men explained, because he had already filled out the cash payment eligibility form provided by the government, he believed he now needed to help re-elect AN in order to see the payment plan operationalized.  DUBAI 00000148  002.2 OF 002   Comment:  Although the plan to replace many food and fuel subsidies with targeted cash payments was removed from the government's budget earlier this month by the Majles, it appears that AN may yet be able to derive some residual benefit at the polls, particularly from less sophisticated voters who do not follow the policy making process closely.  According to domestic news reports, some 95% of households in Iran completed forms to determine their eligibility for the hand-outs.    6. [C/NF]  Michigan State Interest in Recruiting Iranian Students to Dubai: In a meeting with the Consul General to discuss its Dubai branch, Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon expressed an interest in recruiting more Iranian students to increase its enrollment there.  She said that Michigan State plans to increase enrollment gradually at its new Dubai campus, building on the 50 students currently enrolled. Michigan State officials said their ability to recruit in Iran was limited by legal restrictions and logistics, and asked IRPO officer for further ideas on reaching out to prospective students inside Iran and within the Iranian diaspora. University officials also showed interest in working with IRPO on training for Iranian teachers of English, similar to the IRPO grant given to George Mason's Ras Al Khaimah campus last year. Comment:  Interest in US higher education remains high among Iranians, but few are able to meet financial requirements or qualify for a visa. Branches of U.S. universities in Dubai and in the region are a reasonable alternative, and we are exploring ways we can cooperate with Michigan State and others U.S. universities.    7. [C/NF]  No New Interest Rate Policy Until After Election: Commenting on recent Iranian press reports that the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) may institute a new policy to tie interest rates to inflation, one UAE-based Iranian economic consultant downplayed the possibility of any change before June's elections.  While crediting the CBI for attempting the change, rates have generally been set by Presidential decree under AN, the turmoil of the election season forestalls significant changes in policy or management at the top of the CBI. Comment:  Following the Majles' revisions of AN's budget in early March, a dispute between the CBI and AN on interest rate policy could quickly become another hot button issue in Iranian politics.  AN's handling of this issue - deferring it or confronting it head on - will be an indicator of how chastened he was by the budget fight, as well as his political sense. ASGARD 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000162  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  4/7/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PREF, ECON, EAGR, IR SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE -- WINDOW ON IRAN -- APRIL 7, 2009  DUBAI 00000162  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, ActingDirector, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Update on Roxana Saberi: Two separate IRPO contacts have asserted that Roxanna Saberi is part of a political struggle over IRIG relations with the US. One of them, a friend of Saberi who works for BBC Farsi, said that Saberi was taken by elements in the Ministry of Intelligence and Security who want to prevent rapprochement between Iran and America.  She told us that elements in the Ministry of Justice were working for Saberi's release. Our other contact, who has indirect access to senior IRIG officials, partially corroborated that information. He described Saberi as a "political pawn," and confirmed that the Ministry of Justice has sought her release.  He added, however, that even if she is released from Evin Prison soon, she would not yet be allowed to leave Iran.  Iranian sources told our contact that part of the obstacle for her release was that she had been uncooperative and defiant during interrogations, and interrogators were refusing to sign off on her release.  He urged us to try to pass a message to Saberi to remain calm and appear cooperative.  Our contacts' sources also suggested that the USG maintain a very low profile in this case, in his words, "go lights out," to give sympathetic forces in Iran time to resolve it quietly. Comment:  The comments from these two sources further support our view, voiced in the March 31 WOI, that there are spoilers actively working to obstruct any improvement in US-Iran ties.  The broader issue of how the IRIG should respond to any US overture remains highly contentious within Iran, so much so that those who are supportive of engagement are reluctant to raise their profile and be seen as too sympathetic to the US.    2. (S/NF) Qalibaf to Become the Compromise Candidate?  According to an IRPO contact with sources in Iran, Supreme Leader Khamenei has assented to Tehran Mayor Mohammad Qalibaf entering the presidential race as a compromise candidate. Our contact's sources claimed that Qalibaf would receive support from reformist candidate and former Majles Speaker  Mehdi Karroubi, who would drop out in favor of Qalibaf.  There have also been apparent contacts between Qalibaf and Mir Hussein Mousavi over a Qalibaf candidacy, but Mousavi has not indicated whether he would abandon his campaign or not. Qalibaf is also said to be gathering supporters within the IRCG and other security ministries in preparation for announcing his bid. Our contact emphasized that Qalibaf would be a serious candidate who wants to establish a relationship with the US, as is indicated by the Tehran Municipality's interest in buying American agricultural products for distribution before the election.  Comment: All of the speculation that has been building on the emergence of a compromise candidate, be it Qalibaf or someone else, may  end on April 14,  when former IRGC Commander Mohsen Rezai has said that the so-called "national unity" candidate will be announced.  In the interim, rumors and contradictory information about the intentions of potential candidates and the preferences of the Supreme Leader will no doubt dominate conversation in Iranian political circles. For example, although just this week Qalibaf himself stated publicly that he was not planning to run in this election, speculation that he would present a formidable challenge to Ahmadinejad continues.    3. (S/NF)  Iran Supreme Court Member Says Sadeq Larijani to be Next Judiciary Chief:  Supreme Court member Reza Hatami Marbini confidently predicted Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani will be the next Judiciary Chief after Ayatollah Hashemi-Shahrudi's term ends this summer.  Marbini, in Dubai to apply for a visa, said Larijani has already begun attending conferences to learn how the judiciary works.  Ayatollah Larijani, a member of the Guardians Council and Majles speaker Ali Larijani's brother, has been rumored to be under consideration for the post.  In January, a leading advocate to end juvenile executions in Iran deemed Ayatollah Larijani's appointment likely.  She complained to IRPO that she was uncomfortable with Larijani's possible appointment because his legal views are unknown. Whereas she considers Shahrudi a good man but ineffective, she termed Ayatollah Larijani "very political."    4. (C/NF)  UNHCR Worker Predicts Hard(er) Times Ahead for Afghans in Iran:  An Iranian employee of the UNHCR in Tehran told IRPO that he expects Afghans in Iran to come under  DUBAI 00000162  002.2 OF 003   increasing pressure in coming months as the effects of the slowdown in construction in major cities becomes more pronounced.  He explained that the construction boom of recent years had been the primary source of employment for Afghans in Iran, and that construction companies overwhelmingly prefer to hire Afghans, who are regarded as hard workers and are not covered by Iran's rigorous labor protection laws.  The UNHCR protection officer predicted that the IRIG will be hard pressed to deal with the looming crisis as increasing numbers of illegal economic migrants enter from Afghanistan at the same time as their employment opportunities are dwindling.  He also observed that many in the IRIG believe their support for Afghan refugees over the years has been underappreciated by the international community, but cautioned that any goodwill gestures to help Iran's capacity to deal with the refugee and migrant community should be channeled "indirectly" to Iran through the UN. Otherwise, the initiative is likely to be met with "suspicion" by the IRIG.  He also noted that long-term policy pertaining to refugees and illegal migrants is set by the Supreme National Security Council, although implementation typically falls to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Labor.  Comment:  These observations track what we've been hearing from other sources about a significant rise in the number of Afghans attempting to find work in Iran or be trafficked through Iran to destinations in Turkey and continental Europe.    5. (C/NF) BBC Farsi Finding a Receptive Audience: Market researchers from BBC's Persian TV in Dubai told us that they are pleased with the initial positive reactions to the channel. Focus groups and other research among Iranians visiting Dubai during the Nowruz holiday indicated that the channel is attracting a large viewership that appreciates its objective reporting and transparency.  Viewers also related well to the use of Farsi speaking reporters recently brought to London from Iran.  Their research also indicated that the channel was drawing many younger viewers and that a significant portion of them were watching via the Internet.    6. (C/NF) One of the researchers, who had been tracking reaction to the President's Nowruz message by BBC Persian viewers, said BBC's audience's response was unprecedented in the television channel's short history and dominated the Iranian blogosphere for days.  Audience reaction was so immediate and supportive that the atmosphere in the newsroom had been electric, she said. Comment: Our BBC interlocutors were obviously pleased and noted that the detail focus groups provided in commenting on the channel indicated they were attentively watching in Iran.  BBC will share the research with IW watcher in London and VOA.    7. (C/NF) Filmmakers on Mohammad Ehsani's Arrest; Reflections on IVLPs: Two IRPO contacts acquainted with documentary filmmaker Mohammad Ehsani confirmed that he has been jailed since July. One of our sources, who participated in the IVLP program with Ehsani, said that the group had come under MOIS scrutiny before it left Iran last year.  They were "advised" not to travel to the US but not prevented from leaving.  When they returned, many were interrogated, and our contact, who helped organize the program, was banned from leaving Iran for six months.  The group was unsure what had happened to Ehsani, and several months passed without contact from him following their return.  It was only recently that they received the news that he had been arrested and placed in Evin prison. They said Ehsani had spoken publicly of his work with the Asia Society in making a film an even claimed he intended to make a film financed with USG funds, which is likely what led to his arrest.  Our filmmaker contacts were supportive of further cooperation among Iranian and American filmmakers, as have our other film industry contacts. They cautioned however, that USG-sponsored exchanges and partner organizations, especially the Meridian International Center, were under heavy scrutiny.  They suggested working indirectly with universities and other organizations with no direct ties to the USG, as well as keeping groups to four members or less so as to attract less MOIS attention. Comment:  From this and other conversations, we are seeing certain similarities in the cases of IVLP's who attract MOIS attention.  Being seen as an organizer working closely with the USG, or claiming to get USG  DUBAI 00000162  003.2 OF 003   funding, and affiliations with NGOs perceived as having close ties to the Bush Administration appear to be common characteristics in the cases of the Alaeis, Ehsani, and Silva Hartounian.    8. (SBU) Iranian Appellate Court Upholds Alaei Brothers' Conviction: BBC Persian reported April 7 that an appellate court has affirmed the six and three year sentences given to Arash and Kamyar Alaei, respectively.  According to their defense attorney, the court's decision was rendered within one day of receiving their case files and had come two days before the beginning of the Nowruz holiday.    9. (C/NF)  Iranian Sociologist Comments on Development Challenges and Ethnic Relations:  Chief Editor of the Iranian Journal of Sociology, Farhang Ershad, met recently with IRPO Conoff and said that he considers Iran's still prominent clan and kinship networks a significant obstacle to the country's development.  He complained that appointed Iranian officials will staff their offices from those among their kinship networks, to the detriment of the country.  Separately, he commented on the linkages between Persians and Iran's various ethnic groups.  He said that although intermarriage between Arabs and Persians in Khuzestan is normal, Iran's Arab population is generally the farthest removed from the Persian mainstream.  Ershad, a professor at Shahid Chamran University in Khuzestan, said fewer Arabs live in Tehran because they speak Arabic and have difficulty communicating in Farsi.  When questioned about the Baloch, he agreed that their integration is also quite weak but admitted that he did know as much about the Baloch.  Perisan-Kurd and Persian-Azeri ties are better, particularly in Tehran, though he said the mountains separating the Kurdish and Azeri regions from the rest of the country leave the two groups somewhat isolated.  Ershad also explained with some amusement that Persians enjoy telling jokes at the minorities' expense and said Lurs in particular are singled out.  Comment:  Persians account for roughly 50% of the Iranian population and the minority populations, though generally quiescent, are likely less amused with what they consider Persian chauvinism and the jokes at their expense.

VINOGRAD  E.O. 12958: DECL:  4/14/2019 TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: AHMADINEJAD'S WINGS GET CLIPPED ON ECONOMIC POLICY  REF: RPO DUBAI 000121  DUBAI 00000168  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Summary:  Iran's Majles dealt President Ahmadinejad a series of setbacks on economic policy in March that signal the forging of a broad-based opposition to the President's populist economic policies.  These defeats have hurt, but probably not crippled, his plans to distribute cash and economic benefits to voters before the election in June, but they magnify his lack of accomplishments on the economy, a key issue in the election. The reform of Iran's massive subsidies, and the inefficiencies they encourage, will remain part of the public debate as shown by the Supreme Leader branding the new Iranian year as the "year of reforming consumption."    End Summary.    2. (S/NF) On March 12 Iran's Majles approved the budget for the new Iranian fiscal year (1388) that began on March 21, following a lively debate that saw the centerpiece of President Ahmadinejad's economic program, subsidy reforms, defeated in a preliminary vote.  However, a more significant defeat for Ahmadinejad, according to an Iranian contact who is an Ivy-League educated economics professor at the American University of Sharjah in the UAE (please protect), was the Majles' creation of separate entries in the budget for each of the development projects that Ahmadinejad has awarded during his visits to Iran's provinces.  By creating separate budget line items, instead of aggregating the projects in a single fund that Ahmadinejad could disburse at his discretion, the Majles now has more ability to oversee the funding for these projects.  This change created thousands of new line items and was the basis for the President's claim that the Majles' numerous amendments had exceeded its constitutional authority.  The Guardians Council rejected this claim when it approved the Majles' version of the budget one week later.    3. (S/NF)  The defeat of Ahmadinejad's subsidy reforms, a proposal that would have raised the prices of subsidized goods - especially energy - and distributed cash payments to targeted segments of lower-income Iranians, received more media attention than the increased scrutiny of development projects.  Some critics were concerned that a hasty implementation of the cash payments would have been a shock to Iran's economic system.  A separate contact, a UAE-based Iranian economic consultant, summarized the proposal for direct cash payments as a naked attempt to buy votes - especially in rural areas - because the payments would have started before the June election, while the energy prices hikes would not have occurred until after the election.    4. (S/NF) Our academic contact, however, was pleasantly surprised by the overall package of reforms, commenting "the program would make up for all his past mistakes in economic policy."  The subsidy reforms were similar to policies the academic suggested seven years ago, and which the World Bank (one of his previous employers) and the International Monetary Fund have recommended to Iran for several years.  Liberalizing energy prices would have been a large step in combating the waste, inefficiencies, and rent-seeking that plagues Iran's economy, and he described one anecdote of these distortions:  On Iran's eastern border there are many people whose "job" is to fill up a car with a tank of subsidized Iranian gasoline and then drive it over the border to sell at a higher price.    5. (S/NF) A third setback for Ahmadinejad last month was the Majles' revival of Iran's Management and Planning Organization (MPO), whose main task is drawing up the annual budget and overseeing its implementation, according to our academic contact in Sharjah and a report in the Iranian press.  Ahmadinejad dismantled the upper echelons of the MPO in 2006, a move widely criticized as consolidating power over the budget inside the President's office, but MPO offices in the provinces were maintained, according to an MPO employee from Khorasan-e Razavi who was in Dubai to apply for a visa.  The MPO employee has continued to assemble the province's annual budget request to Tehran - presumably to the President's office - since 2006, and in her opinion the restoration of a national MPO to its pre-2006 form will depend heavily on who is elected President in June. A restored MPO is unlikely to have a significant impact on economic policy before the June election because the drafting of  DUBAI 00000168  002.2 OF 003   next year's budget will not begin until later this year, and its first opportunity to impact policy is probably the Fifth Development Plan, a five year plan that is currently being drafted, and which has historically been an MPO-produced document.  A separate contact who is an economics professor in Yazd believes that restoration of the MPO is "the first thing that needs to be done" to improve Iran's economy, and notes that many former MPO officials were signatories to a series of open letters that criticized Ahmadinejad's economic policies.    6. (S/NF) Identifying the personalities or groups responsible for the defeats of the President's policies is difficult, and the fear of becoming targets of criticism will inhibit public claims of victory.  Majles Speaker Ali Larijani's influence has certainly been enhanced, and he has the support of the Supreme Leader and conservative allies, although our academic contact in Sharjah is not a fan of his political or economic policies.  The influence of scholars at Allameh Tabatabai University, who favor strict adherence to Iran's five- and twenty-year development plans and a restoration of the vital role of the MPO in  the economy, provide the theoretical underpinning for many conservatives in the Majles, is also on the rise.   Former Central Bank Governor Tahmasb Mazaheri is primarily responsible for recent declines in inflation and a downturn in the Iranian real estate market, according to the IRPO contact, and the continuation of Mazaheri's policies under the current Central Bank Governor, Mahmud Bahmani, is another sign that the President's room to maneuver on economic policy has been diminished.   Mazaheri was fired when the head of Ahmadinejad's "Quick Return" loan program complained that the Central Bank was not funding that program, but most beneficiaries of these loans used their funds to speculate in real estate instead of investing in the new businesses for which they were intended - a separate contact estimates 75% of these loans have failed.    7. (S/NF)  Ahmadinejad's disregard for government-approved economic plans, especially Iran's Fourth Development Plan (currently in its fifth and final year), is key to understanding his recent sparring with the Larijani and the Majles over the budget, according to a Professor of Economics at Yazd University who is a supporter of former President Khatami and who has received a fellowship to teach at a U.S. university.   The President's disregard for the Fourth Development Plan - which called for a gradual lifting of energy subsidies - is politically motivated because it bears the fingerprints of two of his rivals:   former President Khatami's administration drafted the plan, and it was approved by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's Expediency Council, after the Guardians Council failed to ratify the plan.  Other examples of Ahmadinejad's disregard for the law are his suspending - on his own authority - of the Majles-approved Value Added Tax (VAT) last fall, and his setting aside of the Fourth Development Plan's roadmap for the privatization of state-owned enterprises, according the Yazd academic.  Ahmadinejad's main problem is his egotism, in our contact's opinion, and he thought one of the last lines in Larijani's letter to the President defending the Majles' actions perfectly summarized the speaker's own feelings towards Ahmadinejad, "you should follow the law."    8. (S/NF)  The hidden hand of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is another possible interpretation of Ahmadinejad's recent setbacks in the Majles, according to a separate contact who is UAE-based Iranian businessman in the paper industry.  He believes the IRGC has been amassing political and economic power since the smashing of student protests in 1999, and a cardboard factory he invested $4 million in was confiscated by the IRGC. Describing the direct cash payment plan and the promises of development projects in the provinces as Ahmadinejad's "vote collection plan," the businessman believes that the IRGC worked behind the scenes to thwart these programs and prevent Ahmadinejad from using public funds to increase his popularity in the run-up to the election.  The IRGC has decided that it does not want Ahmadinejad to be the public face of Iran to the West for the next four years, but it has not yet decided on who it does want to support in the June election, the IRPO contact contended.     DUBAI 00000168  003.2 OF 003   9. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad will persevere in his efforts to distribute cash and economic benefits to lower-income Iranians despite the setbacks in the Majles because his priority in economic policy has always been social justice - even at the expense of economic development - according to a political counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Tehran who met with IRPO Officers on his way back to Tokyo.  Since the budget defeat, Ahmadinejad has been noted in Iranian media as continuing to distribute free potatoes to crowds that gather for his speeches, and distributing approximately $10 to employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend a Nowruz speech.  Confrontations over redistributive programs in a prospective second Ahmadinejad term would also continue because of the poor relationship between the President and Majles Speaker Larijani, according to several IRPO contacts.  In terms of electoral politics, the Japanese diplomat warned that Iran's economic performance may not hurt Ahmadinejad with the many voters who distinguish their personal financial situation from the performance of the country's macroeconomic indicators.    10. (S/NF) Comment:  The bruising that Ahmadinejad suffered last month reveals the difficult political landscape Ahmadinejad faces in the weeks before the June election, and which he would face in a prospective second term.  We are struck by the spectrum of factions that IRPO contacts report either authored Ahmadinejad's defeats or have welcomed them, from conservative allies of Larijani, to IRGC elements, to reformist academics. Even the supporters of one of Ahmadinejad's first initiatives - distributing "justice shares" of stock in privatized state companies to lower-income Iranians - realize that it is an evident failure.  Now that most of the his populist schemes, such as directing cash payments to lower-income Iranians, or distributing development projects during his tours to the provinces, have run into roadblocks, our academic contact in Sharjah assessed Ahmadinejad's accomplishments over the past four years by commenting "the emperor has no clothes."  Having clipped Ahmadinejad's wings during the budget process, Larijani and other conservatives in the Majles may feel more empowered to confront the President on issues like government corruption.    11. (S/NF) Comment (Cont'd.): Iran's massive subsidy program will continue to distort Iran's economy and burden government finances as several of IRPO's contacts have observed, and the Supreme Leader's Nowruz message that criticized Iranians' extravagant and wasteful consumption of bread, water, and energy - all of which are subsidized - will keep the issue on the political agenda.  We think the political landscape following Ahmadinejad's setbacks in March suggests that the IRIG will avoid any comprehensive action on subsidy reform and will take incremental steps, such as using media campaigns to encourage conservation or quietly cutting subsidies on discrete items like detergent powder (see Reftel), to address this issue.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000169  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS INL FOR SADGHIANI  E.O. 12958: DECL:  4/14/2019 TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, SOCI, IR SUBJECT: DRUG USE IN IRAN DECLINING, U.S. MODEL CREDITED  DUBAI 00000169  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  A medical professor who consults for the IRIG on drug treatment and prevention programs said that demand reduction programs are showing results in reducing drug use in Iran.  He said that Iran now models many of its demand reduction and addiction treatment efforts on programs developed by the U.S.'s National Institute on Drug Abuse and suggested that collaboration with this organization, as well as between medical universities, would be welcome by Iran.  He also observed that the UNODC office in Tehran is well-regarded and has a good working relationship with the government.  Though happy to speak in generalities about the problem of drug abuse in Iran, he shied away from specifics and cautioned that data regarding the prevalence of addicts and related public health issues such as HIV infection rates is considered very sensitive by the IRIG. End summary.    2. (C) According to a senior consultant to the Ministry of Health's Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Office, contrary to conventional wisdom, illegal drug use in Iran has recently started to decline.  The doctor, who is also an associate professor at Zanjan University Medical School, attributed the decline to government-funded programs designed to reduce demand.  The government, he said, began shifting away from an exclusive focus on punishing traffickers and users and began emphasizing demand reduction in 2007; in his opinion, those efforts are showing promise and will become increasingly effective over the course of the next three to four years.  He also noted that the government has recently invested heavily in border control and predicted that as a result, this year they would be able to more effectively stem the tide of drugs entering Iran through its eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan.    3. (C) The doctor said that opium remains the most popular drug in Iran and estimated that there are about twice as many opium users as there are heroin users, avoiding the use of specific numbers.  He also noted that synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamines and ecstasy, are quite popular but are still mostly confined to urban areas.  The doctor observed that the biggest challenges to addressing illegal drug use in Iran are countering the "supporting culture" that allows opium use to remain socially acceptable and the pervasive use of nicotine from a very early age.  He said that while heroin usage is increasingly stigmatized in Iran society, opium and synthetic drugs are considered "clean drugs" by many.  The doctor believes that the ban on the sale of tobacco products to people under 18 enacted last year and the prohibition of sheesha in coffee shops are positive steps.  Enforcement of the new rules is not 100 percent yet, but he described a noticeable difference from one year ago , and predicted this effort will eventually help bring down illicit drug use in Iran since tobacco use is typically a precursor to narcotics usage.    4. (C) The doctor said that the most effective treatment and demand reduction programs in Iran are based on programs developed by U.S.'s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and are available for free through the internet.  (Note: NIDA is part of the National Institutes of Health.)  He said the programs are adapted to make them "culturally appropriate" for Iran (i.e. removing references to alcohol and adjusting references to sexual relationships).  The doctor spoke highly of NIDA and said he has met NIDA officials at international conferences and has "stayed in touch" with some of them.  (Note: He was in Dubai to apply for a visa to attend a NIDA International Forum conference in Nevada this June. He planned to discuss collaboration with his international counterparts at the conference.)  He also cited Australia as a source for materials and programs that have been successfully adapted with for use in Iran.    5. (C) The doctor noted that the UNODC office in Tehran has an excellent reputation and a solid working relationship with IRIG officials responsible for counter-narcotics efforts.  In response to a question about potential avenues for increased cooperation with the United States or the broader international  DUBAI 00000169  002.2 OF 002   community, he suggested that linkages between universities in the United States and in Iran would be the most effective and least sensitive way to move forward.  He indicated that medical schools and universities would welcome collaborative relationships that helped them better address treatment needs for drug users as well as demand reduction initiatives.  He also said that an opportunity to expand on the informal relationship with NIDA personnel, through the organization of a workshop perhaps, would be a logical next step.  (Note: Substance abuse treatment was the theme of a successful International Visitor program for Iranians in 2007.  Another was planned earlier this year but did not occur after the Iranian participants declined to travel.  End Note.)    6. (C) Near the end of the conversation, the doctor admitted candidly that he was nervous about meeting with IRPO personnel because certain information about drug use and HIV prevalence rates in Iran is considered "sensitive" by the government. Nevertheless, he said that working level officials at the Ministry of Health are aware of his contact with NIDA and support his work.  He said that while he did not need official permission to attend the NIDA conference, he knew to keep his government colleagues aware of his activities to prevent from arousing suspicion.    7. (C) Comment:  Though interdiction and border control efforts are increasingly discussed as possible avenues for cooperation between Iran and the US, according to this source, professional linkages in the treatment and demand reduction fields might also be welcome.  Indeed, Iranian IVLP alumni from the 2007 Substance Abuse IVLP exchange have developed and sustained collaborative relations with American counterparts they met during their visit to the US.  This doctor, who appears to play a leading role in developing and implementing Iran's strategy to combat domestic drug use, paints a more positive picture of current usage and addiction rates than is commonly understood outside of Iran. While he did not seem to be intentionally understating the magnitude of the problem, he was clearly mindful of governmental sensitivity about the issue and steered conversation away from specifics about trafficking patterns or government interdiction efforts.  End comment. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF]  Iranian UN OCHA head seen as invaluable link to IRIG:  According to an Iranian employee of the UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs (please protect), the current OCHA director in Tehran, Ali Ashraf Mojtahed Shabestari, is so well-respected by IRIG officials that their relatively small office is often called upon by other larger UN agencies to help pave the way for agreements with the Iranian government. Shabestari, a former diplomat who served as Iran's ambassador to the UN headquarters in Geneva in the 1980s, is particularly close to Foreign Minister Mottaki and several "senior people" in the Ministry of Interior, she noted.  Because of his access and stature within the ruling elite in Tehran, expatriate colleagues within the broader UN mission sometimes seek Dr. Shabesteri's assistance when requesting permission or collaboration for sensitive activities from the IRIG.  For example, she said that Dr. Shabestari recently provided "cover" via UN OCHA for a training workshop on gender empowerment organized by the UN Population Fund that had been twice cancelled by the government.  By changing the title to "Gender Empowerment in Emergencies" and issuing the invitations to government officials personally, Shabestari was able to overcome IRIG reluctance.  Comment:  In a late January article published by the state-run IRNA, Shabestari reacted positively to President Obama's stated willingness to engage Iran and argued that Iran's "diplomatic apparatus" should remain vigilant "since an opportunity to secure the country's grave national interests might occur merely one fleeting time."    2. [S/NF] A Good Week for Individual Exchanges: IRPO spoke to three exchange participants in separate programs this week, and none reported any trouble from the IRIG related to their travel to the US.  An economics professor from Yazd University spending a semester at the University of Virginia, a medical researcher working with NIH, and a theater director traveling for a Department-funded workshop this summer at the Kennedy Center told us that they had no knowledge of the MFA commission that supposedly is overseeing exchanges with the US and had not asked its permission to travel. The medical researcher showed us a copy of the research agreement that had been signed between NIH and the Mashad University of Medical Sciences as evidence that Iranian authorities were aware and supportive of his trip. Similarly, the economics professor, who has been a useful source in our recent economic reporting, told us that universities and individual professors across Iran were eager to establish partnerships with American institutions.  These partnerships should be a first step in restoring normal relations, he added. Comment: We are hopeful that the experience of these three Iranians indicates a softening attitude among Iranian authorities. We should point out, however, that individuals have seldom had trouble.  We'll know better if the IRIG is again open to IVLP exchanges in May, when the first of several IVLP groups this summer is due to travel.    3. [S/NF]  Budgetary Planning Employee Addresses Dissolution of the Management and Planning Organization and the Iranian Budget:  Monir Vazirnia, a civil engineer with what was the Management and Planning Organization (MPO) in Khorasan-e Razavi province, spoke with IRPO conoff in early April about the changes to the MPO since President Ahmadinejad reorganized the budget-planning body in 2006.  Now known as the Vice-Presidential Department for Strategic Planning and Control, she said Ahmadinejad had initiated the reorganization in order gain more control over the budget process and toward that end removed a number of senior "experts" from the organization.  However, most of the changes have taken place in the upper echelons of the organization and her work has remained the same.  Her role is to formulate the province's budget request for new university and hospital construction, which is fed into the province's broader request and then evaluated in Tehran. Vazirnia also dismissed the Majles' effort to resuscitate the MPO; the MPO falls under the president's authority and its status will depend on the outcome of the presidential election.  She made the following points:    -   Budgets have become less detailed - fewer line items - because Ahmadinejad wants the flexibility to independently determine provincial spending.  DUBAI 00000171  002.2 OF 003      -   Ahmadinejad's subsidy reforms were a positive step, but the plans need to be implemented gradually - the Iranian people are not prepared for dramatic change.  She attributed the rejection of Ahmadinejad's subsidy reform plan to the Majles' legitimate concerns that it would increase inflation.    -   Last year's aborted plan to implement a value-added tax is not likely to be repeated this year.  At the time, Ahmadinejad said the plan's implementation was to be delayed until after the presidential election.  However, according to Vazirnia, the new budget does not include any revenue from the tax.    -   Khorasan-e Razavi had a 20 percent budget deficit last year.  She was unable to forecast the province's deficit for the current year (starting March 21) because she said it would depend on the price of oil.  She said the government responds to deficits by shuttering projects or slowing their pace.  Comment:  Although Vazirnia lives in Mashad and is not privy to the budgetary wrangling in Tehran, her insight into working levels of the MPO is useful.  Her comments indicate the MPO's overhaul had little effect on the bureaucracy outside of Tehran.  As such, reviving the MPO, if pursued by a different president, would be a more straightforward matter.    4. [S/NF] Faculty Changes at Influential University:  Some economics professors at Shahid Beheshti University have recently been forced into early retirement, according to an IRPO contact who is a professor of economics at Yazd University.   Shahid Beheshti is one of three influential centers of economic studies, a group that includes Tehran University and Allameh Tabatabai University, the latter of which has a strong rivalry with Shahid Beheshti.  Many of the sixty economists who have written a series of open letters critical of AN's economic policies come from Allameh Tabatabai University, and they generally favor strict adherence to Iran's five-and twenty-year development plans and a restoration of the Management and Planning Organization (MPO) that AN partially dismantled in 2006, according to the Yazd academic and a separate contact who is an Iranian professor of economics at the American University of Sharjah (please protect).  First Vice President Parviz Davoudi, a graduate of Shahid Beheshti and a key economic adviser to AN, was recently confronted at a gathering in Tehran where he was asked why Iran's gini coefficient - a common measure of inequality of income distribution - has increased in recent years, a question designed to embarrass an administration that has claimed social justice as one of its guiding principles, according to the Yazd academic.   Comment:  Major faculty changes at a key university associated with AN's economic policies could be a sign that their failures are being recognized, or that the faculty is being purged of all but the true believers.  At Yazd University, only one of twelve professors of economics support AN, according to the IRPO contact.    5. [S/NF]  Economic Idol:  To encourage non-oil exports and increased productivity the IRIG continues to award prizes to its best performing firms, according to an IRPO contact who is a professor of economics at Yazd University.  Cash and special export licenses are awarded to the top 25 Iranian exporters, based on sales volume - in a televised ceremony - and a tractor manufacturer in Tabriz is one firm that hopes to win this year, according to an Iranian press article.  The National Productivity Prize is awarded to a leading industrial company, based on guidelines established by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), although the last winner mentioned in Iranian press was an automobile parts manufacturer that won the award in 2006. Comment: Both of these prizes were initiated by former President Khatami's government, and the continued existence of the productivity award, which receives little  DUBAI 00000171  003.2 OF 003   attention from the Iranian media, signals that some Iranian business leaders and academics continue to aspire to Western business values like EFQM, despite AN's rhetoric about the collapse of capitalism.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Summary:  A prominent political scientist from Tehran assesses that moderate presidential contender Mir Hossein Mousavi has - at least in theory - the constituency to win, but that his ability to defeat the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election will depend largely on his ability to get out the vote.  He described a complicated relationship between President Khatami, whom he sees regularly, and Mousavi, who seems not yet to have decided how to manage the considerable assets and potential drawbacks associated with using Khatami's star power on the campaign trail.  The political scientist also pointed to a "softening" of Supreme Leader Khamenei's once-overt support for Ahmadinejad as the reformers and moderates' greatest achievement so far in the run-up to the poll.  He said that most reformers now believe that Khamenei is "comfortable" with the prospect of a Mousavi presidency, and that although he might personally prefer another Ahmadinejad victory, he is now less likely to "push the system hard" in favor of Ahmadinejad.  End summary.    2. (S/NF)  Dr. Hadi Semati (please protect), a prominent political scientist affiliated with the University of Tehran and the Center for Strategic Research, the Expediency Council's think tank, and with extensive experience on US policy circles, shared his views on the current state of play in Iran's upcoming presidential election.  IRPO Officers met with Semati on April 15 for a wide-ranging discussion of domestic Iranian issues and US-Iran relations.    Mousavi Keeping His Distance from Khatami    3. (S/NF)  Dr. Semati met alone with former President Khatami soon after he ended his presidential candidacy mid-March in favor of former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi.  According to Dr. Semati, Khatami's publicly stated rationale for the decision to end his campaign should be taken at face value. Khatami emphasized that he truly believed Mousavi could more effectively govern in the current political climate, and he did not want the moderate vote to be diluted by competing candidates.  He added though that Khatami expressed irritation with Mousavi's decision to announce his own candidacy just two weeks after Khatami formally entered the race.  According to Semati, Khatami told Mousavi directly that he preferred that Mousavi run and would not enter the race if he intended to stand.  Khatami told Semati that Mousavi's response at the time was that he would decide in May.  In Khatami's opinion, a May announcement would have been much too late in the cycle, prompting him to go ahead and enter the race on his own.  Semati observed that despite Khatami's unhappiness over the sequencing of events, he was ultimately relieved to be able to withdraw with a "clear conscience."    4. (S/NF)  Dr. Semati observed that Mousavi now faces a dilemma regarding how to best make use of Khatami's endorsement and support.  As yet, Mousavi has not asked Khatami directly to actively campaign on his behalf.  And according to Semati, although Mousavi needs Khatami's overt help to garner name recognition, particularly among the youth, Mousavi has not yet come to that conclusion himself.  Semati opined that Mousavi appears to believe he can win by himself and that aligning himself too overtly with Khatami would undermine his ability to capture conservative votes.  In Semati's view, this is a risky course because while he believes Mousavi has, "in theory," the constituency to win the election, the outcome of the election will depend entirely on voter participation.  If Mousavi can mobilize to deliver high voter turnout, he will win; conversely, if participation is low, Ahmadinejad will likely prevail.    5. (S/NF)  Dr. Semati said that despite the fact that Mousavi has not directly appealed to Khatami for help, many of the former president's key lieutenants are actively, but quietly, engaging on behalf of Mousavi's candidacy.  According to Semati, more than 80,000 volunteers nation-wide were enlisted over the past year in anticipation of a Khatami candidacy in response to Ahmadinejad's capacity to effectively mobilize the Basij - a lesson the moderates "learned the hard way" in 2005.  Though  DUBAI 00000174  002.2 OF 003   there will be no formal announcement, Semati said this organization is being "activated" for Mousavi as most leading reformers see him as their best hope to unseat Ahmadinejad. Semati also noted that whereas presidential candidate Karroubi has some big names backing him - most notably, former Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, and former Khatami-era cabinet members Mohammad Ali Abtahi, Abbas Abdi, Ataollah Mohajerani, and Mohammad Ali Najafi - Mousavi is starting to pull in the main moderate political organizations, such as Kargozaran and the Association of Combatant Clerics.  That these organizations are lining up behind Mousavi is important, although Semati noted that Karroubi's constellation of famous reformist faces from the Khatami era is "potentially problematic" for Mousavi.    The Karroubi Factor    6. (S/NF)  Dr. Semati assessed that Karroubi would likely draw as many, if not more, votes away from Ahmadinejad as from Mousavi because his principal appeal to voters will be his populist economic proposal to distribute Iran's oil wealth to the people via a still-undefined plan to somehow issue shares directly to the citizenry.  Semati also observed that while Karroubi is making "bolder" promises than Mousavi in terms of opening Iran's political structure to greater competition, most moderates don't "take him seriously."  According to Semati, Karroubi is proposing systemic reforms that he can't possibly deliver within the framework of contemporary Iranian politics. While such reforms have some appeal to voters, given the "national trauma" associated with the failure of the Khatami administration to institute such measures, Semati believes that Karroubi is not "taken seriously" by most politically-active moderates.  It was precisely this reasoning that led Khatami to throw his weight behind Mousavi, a "revolutionary who has evolved" as opposed to Karroubi, in Semati's opinion.  Mousavi, he noted, will be careful about managing expectations and therefore will be able to deliver more of what he promises.    Khatami's Withdrawal "Softened" the Supreme Leader    7.  (S/NF)  Dr. Semati believes that Khatami's decision to withdraw from the election has already delivered an important victory to moderates: a "softening" of Supreme Leader Khamenei's overt support for Ahmadinejad.  Semati said that most reformers now believe that Khamenei is "comfortable" with the prospect of a Mousavi presidency, and that although he might personally prefer another Ahmadinejad victory, he is now less likely to "push the system hard" in favor of Ahmadinejad.    8. (S/NF) Semati further noted that the leadership is currently "firmly" in control and that there is reluctance, even among the "hard core reformers" for any sort of dramatic change to Iran's system of government.  At least, Semati said, Khamenei can keep the Revolutionary Guards and more radical fringe elements of the body politic in check.  Khamenei does respond to pressure, particularly when it comes from both within and outside of the system.  If Ahmadinejad fails to win re-election, Semati predicted, it will ultimately be due to the fact that he has made himself a virtual "outsider" by antagonizing so many powerful elements within the governing clique.  Semati believes Khamenei considers Ahmadinejad's hard-line presentation of Iran's foreign policy successful, but that he is also aware of the president's "disastrous" management of the economy and other domestic policy issues.  Comfortable that Mousavi will not cross any red lines, Khamenei is prepared to allow for reasonable competition within the system.    This Election Matters    9. (S/NF)  Dr. Semati observed that while it is difficult to predict how the outcome of this election will impact relations between the U.S. and Iran, the consequences domestically are  DUBAI 00000174  003.2 OF 003   quite clear.  A second Ahmadinejad government would only hasten Iran's brain drain, including among the "intellectual elite" - the political class who comprise what remains of the Reform Movement.  Semati also predicted that a renewed mandate for Ahmadinejad would be the death knell of the remaining qualified technocrats in government.  Like other IRPO contacts, he anticipates that participation in this election will exceed that of the 2005 race, but not reach the 80 plus percent during the Khatami.    10. (S/NF)  Comment:  Dr. Semati offers well-informed perspective on the election in general and relations between Khatami and Mousavi in particular.  However, his insider's view is limited by the fact that he has no direct ties to Ahmadinejad's inner circle or other conservative elements within the system.  In fact, he was told directly by Khatami just one year ago that he is on a "velvet revolution list" maintained by hardliners due to his 2007 fellowship at the Wilson Center and his efforts to get Haleh Esfandiari released.  Furthermore, Dr. Semati was perhaps overly dismissive of the prospect of another viable candidate emerging, given the increasingly frequent signals that former IRGC commander Mohsen Rezai may throw his hat in the ring as a compromise candidate.  Dr. Semati emphasized, however, a point we have heard repeatedly from Iranian interlocutors: electoral politics in Iran is essentially "inside baseball" until the last couple of weeks of the cycle when the list of qualified candidates is released by the Guardians Council.  Nevertheless, past elections have shown that both wrangling at the top and building momentum among voters are key facors in determining the final outcome. End comment. ASGARD 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000176  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  4/21/2019 TAGS: PGOV, ECON, KDEM, SOCI, IR SUBJECT: DECONSTRUCTING THE IRANIAN ELECTORATE  REF: RPO 72  DUBAI 00000176  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S) Summary: The Iranian electorate comprises a diverse mix of voters, including the true believers, the scared voters, and those just looking for moderate improvement. This year, much discussion has centered on four groups of voters: rural voters, urban voters, young voters, and a potential bloc of IRGC/Basij votes.  Rural voters are considered Ahmadinejad's base of support but accurately gauging his standing in the provinces is extremely difficult. IRPO contacts say that his promises of economic development both help and hurt the president, without really knowing where he stands.  Urban voters have recently stayed away from the polls, ceding influence, to the rural areas.  However, many of our Tehran-based contacts anticipate greater participation this year, largely stemming from an anti-Ahmadinejad vote.    2. (S) Summary, cont'd: Iran's demographics dictate the importance of the youth vote-roughly 18 million of the 42 million eligible voters are between the ages of 18 and 27. Their proportion of the electorate present a distinct vulnerability to presidential candidate Mir Hosseyn Mousavi, whose 20-year absence from politics makes him a relative unknown among the youth. Perhaps overstated, however, is the importance of the IRGC/Basij.  IRPO contacts generally dismiss fears that the IRGC will unite behind a particular candidate even while acknowledging that the Basij may again be mobilized. End summary.    Rural Voters Take Center Stage~  -------------------------------    3. (S) Rural voters have played an increasingly outsized role in recent elections.  According to an IRPO contact with family in the provinces, elections in rural areas remain a community event.  Much of the town on election day will attend Friday Prayers and then collectively head to the polls.  Although she observed there was not necessarily pressure to vote for a particular candidate, peer pressure induced many in the community to vote (Note: The election is on a Friday, June 12. If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, the second round will be held the next Friday, June 19). According to press reports, despite accounting for 35 percent of the national population in 2005, Iran's rural voters cast 50 percent of the votes. Even though Iran's 2006 census shows a drop in the rural share of population to roughly 30 percent, such voters are still almost certain to be a disproportionate share of those casting ballots.    4. (S) Iran's presidential contenders recognize the rural vote's newfound importance, and indeed, it is a critical component of Ahmadinejad's re-election campaign.  Ahmadinejad's now-famous provincial trips had brought him to Iran's hinterlands 52 times by February, according to one estimate.  Along the way, he has provided cash handouts to those attending his rallies and promised large public works projects to the tune of billions of dollars. His provincial visits drew thousands and probably earned the president a reservoir of support.  However, Ahmadinejad's largesse and promises in the provinces cut both ways, according to our contacts. An Iranian constitutional law expert and former political analyst in Iran said that Ahmadinejad "overpromises" but does deliver on at least some of his pledges, leaving some voters satisfied with provincial development and others disappointed with the broken promises.  A prominent political scientist at Tehran University cautiously speculated that, due to his overpromises, Ahmadinejad's rural support has declined.    5. (C) Ahmadinejad's opponents in the 2009 election are following his lead.  Former President Khatami, before dropping out of the election, began his campaign with visits to several provinces. Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi visited the provinces in April.  Still, the reformers will not be able to match the time Ahmadinejad has spent cultivating support in the provinces and nor will their trips garner the same media coverage awarded to the president.    6. (S) How the provinces will vote is difficult to gauge.  A Japanese diplomat posted to Tehran implied in a meeting with IRPO that he had little insight into the rural areas, despite his own trips to the provinces.  Similarly, the Iran political analyst cited above said his political consulting firm in 2005  DUBAI 00000176  002.2 OF 003   found predicting rural voting difficult.    7. (S) In early April IRPO officers spoke with several Iranian merchants in Dubai's spice souk as a proxy for the rural vote. The merchants hailed from different parts of Fars province, in the south of Iran, and spend about three-quarters of the year in Dubai and the rest in Iran. The merchants were notable for their interest in the election and the range of their views.  All were following the election closely, to the point that a few were eagerly anticipating Mousavi's first news conference later that day.. Some supported Ahmadinejad and his hardline approach; another believed Iran needed a more moderate face.  Another group, explaining their reluctance to participate, said Supreme Leader Khamenei's vote outweighs all others. There was no clear favorite among the merchants.    ~While Urban Voters Stayed Away  -------------------------------    8. (S) Rural voters would not have reached such prominence without urban voters' increasing apathy.  Tehran is illustrative in this regard, where recent turnout has mostly been under 30 percent, according to press reports. Were the urban areas to turnout in proportion to their 70 percent share of the population they would easily determine the election's outcome. There are nascent signs that urban areas will participate in greater numbers this year.  A marketing director in her early 30s who moved to Dubai from Tehran in January told IRPO that she and all her friends intend to vote, as do all her friends. He said they all stayed home in 2005 and "look what happened."  She characterized Ahmadinejad's time in office as a disaster. Another IRPO contact, an older businessman who splits his time between Tehran and Dubai predicted turnout would match that of Khatami's era. For Iran's educated elite, he said, the most pressing issue is not the faltering economy but rather the relationship with the USG.  Not surprisingly, they want to replace Ahmadinejad with someone who better represents Iran to the international community.  A Tehran University political scientist expects turnout to exceed the turnout in 2005, but he does not expect it to approach that of the Khatami elections.    9. (S) As we have reported earlier, IRPO has spoken with many urban Iranians who previously voted for Khatami but now voice little interest in Iranian politics (reftel).  Some Iranian visa seekers in Dubai, even if they agree the election is important, have said they do not intend to vote.  One woman commented that although life is worse under Ahmadinejad, it was still bad under Khatami.  Such dissatisfied urban voters are the reformers' natural constituency. Overcoming their reticence to vote is a principal challenge for reformist candidates.    Engaging Iran's Youth  ---------------------    10. (C) Equally challenging, and critical, will be drawing Iran's youth to the polls.  In this election, there will be fewer voters participating solely to exercise a new-found right, as most of Iran's youth came of voting age in 2005. By dint of their numbers, however, an Iranian political consultant based in Tehran deemed the Iranian youth the key to the election. According to the 2006 census, the 15 to 24 age bracket includes nearly 18 million Iranians and with roughly three years since the census' publication, most of this age group should now be eligible to vote.  However, outside of the Basij, politicians and political parties have not demonstrated effective get-out-the-vote strategies and it is not clear if they will be able to do so.    11. (S) Although much of the reformist movement in Iran is coalescing around Mousavi, the youth remain a distinct vulnerability.  Due to his roughly 20-year absence from Iranian politics, many Iranian youth do not know him.  IRPO conoff has several times asked young Iranians for their opinion of Mousavi and, when met with blank stares, been forced to explain who he is.  At the same time, Khatami's endorsement can help Mousavi overcome this hurdle.  A few visa applicants have commented that Khatami's endorsement is very meaningful to them. Even though  DUBAI 00000176  003.2 OF 003   they know little about Mousavi, Khatami's support is sufficient for them to vote for him.    The IRGC and Basij Factor  -------------------------    12. (S) Fears of that the IRIG will tilt the system in favor of a preferred candidate, Ahmadinejad in this case, often center on the IRGC and Basij. Our contacts largely discount the idea that the IRGC will favor one candidate or that the organization represents a homogeneous voting bloc.  The Tehran University political scientist cited above argued the conscripts in the IRGC are more likely to match the public's voting trend rather than collectively support a favored IRGC candidate.  Beyond that, he estimated 30 to 40 percent of the committed "Sepahis" hate Ahmadinejad and his management of the country.    13. (S) In a review of the 2005 presidential election, the former political analyst, who was in Tehran at the time, wrote that the Basij's chief influence in the election was their ability to mobilize voters.  That potential still exists. One observer thinks the Basij may again be mobilized to vote for Ahmadinejad. If the other candidates in this election are unable to create a similar network, the Basij will remain a distinct advantage for Ahmadinejad, particularly if the election is close.    14. (S) Whether the Basij actually carries out direct fraud is another question. In his review of the 2005 election, the political analyst discounted the likelihood that fraud was a significant factor in the election.  In this election, however, several IRPO contacts maintain the risk of fraud is greater because the institutions charged with overseeing the election-the Interior Ministry and the Council of Guardians-are in conservative hands. The Interior Minister is a long-time ally of the president and Ahmadinejad's opponents recently criticized the Secretary of the Guardians Council for openly supporting the president.    Comment:  --------    15. (S) in the groups of voters discussed above-rural voters, urban voters, young voters, and the IRGC/Basij-the voters seem more a heterogeneous mix than a uniform bloc of voters, rendering it difficult to anticipate how the different groups will vote on June 12. Despite the variety of opinions, the majority of our interlocutors believe this election is very important and anticipate higher turnout than the 60 percent in 2005. It may go even higher as many Iranians consider the costs of another four years of Ahmadinejad.    16. (S) Many Iranians have said the election is important because Iran needs to rid itself of Ahmadinejad and many plan to vote for that reason alone.  Ahmadinejad in 2005 benefitted from a distinct anti-Rafsanjani vote.  This year, it appears Ahmadinjead's opponents will benefit from what may be a sizeable anti-Ahmadinejad vote. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Game of Attrition. Ahmadinejad's defeats on the budget and his plan to distribute cash payments to lower-income Iranians show that power centers, such as the Majles, are actively working to pressure the President prior to the June election, according to a Tehran-based economist for a Norwegian energy firm who is in email contact with IRPO officers.  These power centers are also stepping up their lobbying of Supreme Leader Khamenei to get his backing to stall or overturn some Presidential authorities.  This game is increasingly being played out in the media, where the sides openly attack each other, and where the President's public defenses are weakening his hand and depleting political capital that he would prefer to save for the bigger fights ahead.  The cash payment plan could have garnered AN additional votes, but he continues to "work the rounds" in the provinces and maintain his base of support where it really matters.  By June, the current policy debates will matter less, and it is too early to consider these moves decisive to AN's electoral prospects, according to the economist. Comment:  If these power centers can get increased backing from Khamenei, we may see some interesting fireworks in Iranian press in the coming weeks.  As IRPO has previously reported, identifying the power centers responsible for AN' setbacks on economic policy last month is difficult but could include a broad spectrum of political factions.    2. (S/NF) Former Public Prosecutor Asserts Pervasive MOIS Influence in Revolutionary Courts:   Seyed Mehdi Mirghaemi, a former public prosecutor in Arak and now a private lawyer, said the MOIS will sometimes help assemble charges against defendants, direct cases to particular judges, and order judges to rule a particular way.  Structurally, he said the Revolutionary Courts are similar to other courts, fall under the Judiciary's authority, and are theoretically supposed to follow the same law.  Defendants are allowed to have lawyers during their trials, can defend themselves, and can appeal decisions. Asked about Roxanna Saberi, Mirghaemi said he was aware of her case, but had no specific information on it.  Comment:  The Revolutionary Courts' lack of transparency and seemingly baseless decision making make Mirghaemi's allegations plausible and perhaps probable.   Mirghaemi's work in the judiciary branch as a public prosecutor in Arak also gives his assertions some credibility, but he did not work in the Revolutionary Courts. His accusations are more likely to reflect the legal community's assumptions rather than first-hand knowledge of MOIS influence. Mirghaemi was also notable for the depth of his anti-regime sentiment, which probably colors his impressions of the Revolutionary Courts.    3. (S/NF) Mousavi's Economic Program.  Moderate presidential candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi announced his economic program to the Iranian press this week, emphasizing economic growth and job creation from a rejuvenated and expanded private sector. Mousavi criticized AN's halting steps at privatization, calling them "the institutionalization of non-productive government management."  Stability in government policies and a strict adherence to the planning documents of a restored Management and Planning Organization (MPO) and the "rule of law," are other key planks.  The best talking point in the plan, "social justice doesn't mean equal distribution of poverty," challenges AN's key economic goal by inserting economic growth into the equation and highlighting his poor economic management.  Mousavi's plan only briefly mentions subsidy reforms, stressing the need to implement them gradually, after careful preparation. Comment: Mousavi's plan mentions Article 44 of Iran's constitution, which defines the role of the state, cooperative, and private sectors in Iran's economy, but his emphasis on a strong private sector may open the plan to criticism that it is in conflict with the constitution.  Mousavi also threatens to withdraw Iran's Fifth Five Year Development Plan, currently being drafted, if AN submits it to the Majles before the election. An IRPO contact who is a professor of economics at Yazd University, and who is concerned that AN's government is drafting the plan, didn't expect the plan to be finished until later this year.    4. (S/NF) Tehran Chamber of Commerce Member Comments on Iran-Americas Chamber:  Seyed Hamid Hosseini, a member of the  DUBAI 00000177  002.2 OF 003   Tehran Chamber of Commerce (TCC) and the director of an Iranian oil and medical conglomerate, said Iran's Ministry of Commerce has approved the creation of an Iran-Americas Chamber of Commerce in anticipation of improved US-Iran ties.  Although the chamber's primary focus is the US, due to political sensitivities, it will not be called an Iran-US chamber. Mohammad Nahavandian, head of the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and Mines (ICCIM), on April 20 said Iran's private sector planned to establish trade councils with Latin America, Central America, and North America.  Hosseini, also a member of the ICCIM, made the following points:    -- Khamenei instructed Ahmadinejad to base the Fifth Five Year Development Plan on a draft from the Expediency Council. Hosseini alleged that both the Expediency Council and the president submitted drafts of the plan to Khamenei and Khamenei favored the Expediency Council's version.    -- The current year will be positive for Iranian businesses. Hosseini, admittedly in contrast with many of his colleagues, is optimistic because the election allows Iran the opportunity to remove Ahmadinejad and because he believes economic ties with the US will be a positive shock to the Iranian economy.    -- Khamenei moderated his support for Ahmadinejad following Khatami's decision to exit the contest.  Hosseini predicts Mir Hossein Mousavi will win the election.    -- The TCC meetings are more productive than the ICCIM meetings.  The TCC has a monthly meeting with government representatives, including ministers; the TCC members prepare for the meetings and, typically, complain a great deal during the meetings about government policy. Although the government is not always responsive to their complaints, following a recent meeting, the oil minister appointed a committee to resolve the TCC's concerns.  Participants in ICCIM meetings, which include representatives from the provincial chambers, are typically unprepared.    --Iranians seeking an export license must be a member of a chamber of commerce and both the Ministry of Commerce and a chamber must approve the export license.    Comment:  As a member of the TCC and ICCIM and allegedly married to Expediency Council chairman Rafsanjani's niece, Hosseini seems well placed to comment on economic and political developments in Iran.  However, his assertion that the Expediency Council submitted a draft of the next Five Year Development plan is unusual because normally the president's office drafts the plan and submits it to the Majles.   The early involvement of the Expediency Council may reflect Rafsanjani's concern over Ahmadinejad's economic policies.  Khamenei in a letter to Ahmadinejad in January outlined the general policies to be included in the plan; it is possible the letter is based on a plan from the Expediency Council.    5. (S/NF) IRIG Suspicion Extends to Its Own Official Delegations:  A  member of the Iranian delegation to this month's IMF/World Bank meetings hinted to IRPO local staff that official Iranian delegations can be scrutinized as much as exchange groups headed to the US.  Chatting with local staff while waiting for his interview, Dr. Abbasali Noora, the Majles representative for Baluchistan, implied that IRIG officials had carefully vetted members of the IMF delegation.  Separately, he told conoff, sotto voce, that the IRIG had only decided to allow some delegation members to travel two weeks ago, although their visa applications had been ready much earlier, and that was why they were late in applying. Comment: The delay in submitting the  DUBAI 00000177  003.2 OF 003   visa applications may have been simple bureaucratic inefficiency, although Noora indicated he strongly believed that security agencies were scrutinizing members of the delegation before permitting them to travel.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) An IRPO contact on April 22 recounted to us his conversation with an Iranian source who claimed Roxanna Saberi's sentence will be commuted to six months.  Our contact said the Iranian source, who has access to Iranian officials,  asserted vigorously  that Tehran had already decided to commute the sentence and added that  it would be a sign of "good faith." The Iranian hinted that hard-line elements in the IRIG had opposed Saberi's immediate release; therefore the reduced sentence was a compromise, according to our contact (reftel). At the same time, the IRPO contact said, the Iranian source insinuated that the US could reciprocate by taking steps to resolve the situation of the Iranians arrested by the US military in Iraq.    2. (S/NF) The Iranian source also claimed that he had read Saberi's file and that there was a basis for the espionage allegation,  but he did not disclose any additional information related to the charge. The Iranian, repeating the IRIG's current line, spent several minutes during the conversation with our contact complaining that the US had thus far only changed its tone and not its actions toward Iran.    3. (S/NF) Comment: Our contact said his Iranian interlocutor, who is known to IRPO, often speaks in ambiguities on US-Iran relations and Iranian policymaking. On Saberi, however, he spoke unequivocally in declaring that her sentence will be reduced as a step toward resolving this issue. Whether it is an accurate statement, however, is not yet certain, given what seems to be a continuing tug-of-way over Saberi going on in Tehran.  RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Summary:  As economic issues rise to the top of the agenda in Iran's presidential campaigns, the range of the policy debate on economic issues remains narrow and is essentially limited to which candidate can better manage Iran's government dominated economy.  Recent examples of currency reforms and private sector initiatives being undermined by the IRIG illustrate the limits of reform initiatives, even if there is political will, and the disconnection between rhetoric and practice.  The experiences of our contacts illustrate that even if economic conditions lead to Ahmadinejad's defeat in June, significant reforms to Iran's economy are unlikely in the near term. End Summary.    The State's Not-So-Hidden Hand  -----------------------------------    2. (S/NF) The political struggle in the Majles over President Ahmadinejad's subsidy reforms in March and the campaigning for June's presidential election have placed economic issues at the top of Iran's political agenda.  However, the range of debate on economic policy is narrow, as Dr. Hooshang Amirahmadi, president of the American Iranian Council, told an oil and gas conference in Dubai on April 21.    Amirahmadi described all three of the major declared candidates -- Ahmadinejad, Mir Hossein Mousavi, and Mehdi Karroubi -- as status quo candidates on economic policy, committed to maintaining the government's role in the economy but singling out Mousavi as a more competent manager. For example, one of reformist candidate Karroubi's proposals, to distribute  shares of Iran's oil wealth directly to the people (ref a), is an echo of Ahmadinejad's 2005 rhetoric to put Iran's oil wealth on Iranians'  dinner tables and to distribute "justice shares" of state-owned enterprises to the people.    3. (S/NF) More broadly, the powerful conservative forces that dealt Ahmadinejad setbacks in the Majles last month (ref b), who have not coalesced behind a candidate at this stage, simply favor strict adherence to Iran's five- and 20-year development plans and a restoration of the vital role of the Management and Planning Organization (MPO) in the economy, according to several IRPO academic contacts and reports in the Iranian press. Moreover, the dividing line between them and Ahmadinejad is not over the degree of state control.  Rather, Ahmadinejad's policies have been to maintain robust state involvement in the economy, but through less transparent structures like the Office of the President and the IRGC, and with an emphasis on redistributive spending in the name of social justice.    Narrow Margins  --------------    4. (S/NF) In the unlikely event that a presidential candidate emerges who champions major economic reforms, rhetoric and practice can be disconnected, according to IRPO business and academic contacts.  And business interests that stand to lose as a result of reforms are often compensated in other ways that blunt the effects of reform.  For example, Tehran unified its two separate official exchange rates for its currency in 2002, a reform that eliminated a preferential export rate that was a costly and disastrous policy, according to an Iranian contact who is an Ivy-League educated Professor of Economics at the American University of Sharjah in the UAE (please protect).    5. (S/NF) At the same time as the IRIG was reforming exchange rates, it also began an export rewards program, commonly referred to as a rebate system by Dubai-based Iranian businessmen.  The net result was that exporters who lost a favorable exchange rate under the reform were compensated through a different method.  Under this system, rebates based on the value of the goods are offered to exporters, with industrial products receiving the largest rebate of 3 percent, and agricultural and handiwork products receiving smaller rebates, according to Hassan Kabiri, a scion of a prominent bazaari family and managing director/owner of Paknam, one of Iran's largest producers of detergent powder. Multiple IRPO contacts  DUBAI 00000181  002.2 OF 003   also reported that the rebates program is open to abuse and manipulation to favor regime insiders.    6. (S/NF) The importance of the rebate and hard currency programs to a company's bottom line is tied to the firms' dependence on export markets.  A separate Dubai-based contact who runs an adhesive factory in Tehran and exports his products to Iraq and Central Asian countries described the rebates as crucial to the competitiveness of his products and his firm's success, and they are a much more important factor to his business viability than international sanctions against Iran. And while the government has tried to compensate exporters, producers selling to the domestic market have suffered from muddled government attempts at reform.  For Kabiri, whose market for detergent is primarily domestic, the export rebate is not a critical issue, and he is not actively pursuing USD 1.3 million in rebates the government owes him because the paperwork is too much of a burden.  For him, the most important government interventions have been consumer price subsidies on detergent, and the tariff rate on imported detergent, both of which have been manipulated to his disadvantage in the past year.  IRPO contacts could not gauge the extent to which the rebate and hard currency programs have replaced the former system of multiple exchange rates, but their existence shows how resistant the Iranian economy is to reform.    The Price of Success  --------------------    7. (S/NF) A second example of economic innovation being stifled has been the seizures of promising private enterprises by the IRGC.  Iran's small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) could be an agent for reform by creating jobs and being a force for innovation, and one study by an academic at Yazd University of 11,000 SMEs showed that 10 percent of Iran's SMEs created over 70 percent of the jobs in that sector. However, the fear of becoming too successful and attracting the attention of the IRGC, and then being seized by the IRGC or its affiliated companies, has constrained multiple IRPO contacts -- representing the frozen fish, paper, and adhesive industries -- from growing their successful businesses to the extent they could.  Entrepreneurs are frequently labeled "fraudsters," according to an IRPO contact who had a paper factory seized by the IRGC.    8. (S/NF) The saga of the adhesive producer illustrates how a government seizure has stifled private enterprise.  The IRPO contact acquired a small adhesives workshop from an elderly couple, who were experts in their industry, but who had failed to grow the business because of their communist ideology.  By introducing Western business practices, improving product quality, and introducing innovative products, the IRPO contact has built up the business, but he has made the decision to limit its growth based on his past experiences.  He was formerly the manager of a company that imported U.S.-origin cigarettes into Iran, a business he rapidly built to a level where it employed more than 1,000 people. Eventually the government took notice of this business, and after Ahmadinejad was elected, it seized his import license and handed the business to allies of Ahmadinejad, who were probably IRGC-affiliated, according to the businessman.  None of our contacts could gauge how many jobs or other economic benefits the fear of IRGC seizure has cost the Iranian economy, but any reforms that focus on Iran's private sector will first have to establish the rule of law to overcome the fear of IRGC takeovers.    Comment  -------    9. (S/NF) Iran's economic shortcomings receive much attention, but the policy debate we have seen at this stage of the presidential contest has only been on the margins of Iran's legacy of state control of economic activity.  The experiences of the Dubai-based Iranian businessmen show that even if economic conditions lead to Ahmadinejad's defeat in June,  DUBAI 00000181  003.2 OF 003   significant reforms to Iran's economy are unlikely in the near term.  We are interested whether any of the candidates will claim ownership of Iran's gasoline rationing program (implemented in June 2007), an example of an effort to reign in Iran's massive energy subsidies that has met with some success, as a gauge of their appetite for difficult reforms.  Economic problems will more likely simply be the issues that candidates use to attack their rivals. RICHARDSON 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000187  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  5/6/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, IR SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE DUBAI: WINDOW ON IRAN - MAY 6, 2009  DUBAI 00000187  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Election Update - Let's Make a Deal: During a May 5 meeting with IRPO Officers, a Tehran-based businessman who travels regularly to Dubai detailed several important backstories for the upcoming presidential elections.  (This contact is a former IRGC officer who was based in Khuzestan during the Iran-Iraq war and who then went on to serve as a senior official at the Bonyad-e Shahid.):    - Why Khatami Withdrew: Providing background on Khatami's withdrawal, source said that Khatami was heavily pressured to withdraw by the Supreme Leader.  This pressure came after Khatami's three provincial campaign trips revealed his broad support, which took a vocal and decidedly anti-regime tone at his campaign rallies at Yasuj, Yazd, and another provincial capital. (Such provincial populations were considered the stronghold of Ahmadinejad's conservative support base.)  Based upon assessments of domestic political dynamics, an IRGC internal report assessing the impact of a Khatami candidacy concluded that Khatami would likely prevail in the first round of the presidential elections (by getting over 50 percent of the vote), and that the IRGC and other internal security forces would be unable -  in contrast to their successful dissent control during Khatami's first presidency - to quell the anti-regime sentiment this outcome would unleash.  Khatami reportedly agreed to withdraw, but with Rafsanjani's solid support, he was able to extract a concession from the Supreme Leader for doing so - namely, that the SL would not support Ahmadinejad for the election.    - An Ahmadinejad Loss May Spell the End of the Supreme Leader: Despite the deal reported above, it is still widely speculated that the SL will support AN behind the scenes.  Given that AN's sole remaining source of senior-level support is the SL, if the SL provides him quiet support and he loses, this contact concluded that the SL's grip on power would be hurt enough for Rafsanjani to step in and use his position on the Assembly of Experts to dismiss him (and likely replace him with a leadership council.)    - Larijani Floats Threat to Run to Ensure Brother Takes Over Judiciary: Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Majles reportedly threatened to challenge AN directly by entering the presidential race if his brother, Sadegh Larijani, is not appointed to replace Ayatollah Shahroudi once the Judiciary Chief's term expires in two months.    - Karroubi Offers Terms Upon Which He Would Withdraw: Reformist presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi is reportedly in negotiations with reformist frontrunner Mir Hossein Moussavi to withdraw, allowing the consolidation of reformist votes, under the condition that he is able to secure four cabinet positions (reportedly to include the Ministry of Interior) for his allies.    2. (S/NF) Comment: These machinations, based upon reasonably reliable, confidential insider information, suggest significant political maneuvering underlies what now appears to be a straightforward two person race between AN and Moussavi.  Such horse-trading offers some insight into why candidates without strong prospects for victory enter and remain in the race - perhaps merely to secure political concessions for themselves or key political allies.  Such concessions for eventual withdrawal can only grow in value if they survive the Guardian Council vetting process.    3. (S/NF) Is the IRIG Changing its Tone on Cultural Diplomacy?: An IRPO contact with direct access to the IRIG invited IRPO Deputy Director to discuss cultural exchanges and other public diplomacy programs with Iran on April 24.  The contact, who was aware of deputy director's travel to Washington for the Iran Watcher Conference and wanted to meet before his departure, said the IRIG "had no problem" with US cultural exchange programs and then offered five suggestions for expanding people-to-people contacts between the US and Iran.  They were  DUBAI 00000187  002.2 OF 003   relaxed visa requirements, promoting partnerships between Iranian and US universities, sponsoring Iranian cultural events in the US, encouraging tourism in both countries, and finding the right partners for cultural exchange programming. Elaborating on his final suggestion, he implied that cultural exchanges may go more smoothly if the USG worked with the IRIG directly, rather than those "who are motivated by profit."  Our interlocutor said that mutual understanding between people in both countries could help to resolve the political differences between the two governments.  IRPO Deputy Director said the arrests of Roxana Saberi and others, like the Alaei brothers, contradicted the message of greater cooperation.  On Saberi, our contact said that her case would be resolved soon, and on potential danger to participants in future exchanges, he said their security was assured.  Comment:  Our interlocutor was positive, except for grumbling about the difficulty in getting a visa, and the conversation was absent any rhetoric equating exchanges to "velvet revolution."  If he was conveying a message on behalf of the IRIG, then it suggests a new receptiveness in Tehran to cooperation in this sphere.   As the Iranians are fond of saying, however, changes in actions more than words will be necessary.    4. (C)  Iran Fears Cross-Border Links Between Baloch Groups: According to an Iranian security analyst with direct access to IRGC officers, Iranian authorities are increasingly concerned that the deteriorating situation inside Pakistan could create sanctuaries for Jundullah militants and/or opportunities for direct cooperation between Jundullah and  Pakistani Baloch insurgents.  While instability in Afghanistan has been the norm for decades, the analyst contended, Tehran is scrambling to prepare for the possibility that Pakistan may weaken to the extent that its territorial integrity could be challenged by separatist groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army, with subsequent spill-over into Iran's Sistan Va Balochistan province.  He noted that the while the BLA has so far confined its operations to Pakistan, it is officially committed to the creation of a Greater Balochistan comprised of Baloch people now living in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan.  The analyst asserted that the April announcement that the responsibility for fighting terrorists in the eastern part of the country was transferred from regular armed forces and police units to the IRGC is the cornerstone of Tehran's efforts to prepare for the fall-out should Pakistani insurgents feels sufficiently emboldened to attempt operational coordination with Baloch militants inside Iran.  He said that IRGC officials are also determined to further enhance border security through the completion of a border wall, the digging of trenches, and the provision of better equipment to forces deployed on Iran's eastern border.    5. (S/NF) Prominent Human Rights Lawyer Sits Down with IRPO: The lawyer, in private practice in Tehran and Golestan, has defended human rights activists, student activists, and several banned newspapers. He said that Tehran General Prosecutor Sa'id Mortezavi is more powerful than Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Shahrudi due to his direct relationship with Supreme Leader Khamenei.  He does not expect the change in judiciary chiefs this summer to change the dynamic.  The lawyer approaches each of his cases differently; sometimes he will speak to the press while at other times he believes a quieter strategy is more beneficial. He said his personal relationship with Mortezavi also helps - he believes that Mortezavi respects him because he was jailed before the Revolution for political activity.  Cases also depend on which organization made the initial arrest; he said being detained by the judicial police is worse than the MOIS or LEF.  The lawyer has been invited by several prominent universities in the U.S. to speak on the human rights situation and was in Dubai to apply for a visa. He had no first-hand insight into Roxana Saberi or Ehsa Momeni's cases but predicted Saberi's sentence would be substantially reduced.  He made the following points:    - The Iranian government is most concerned about the student movement, the women's rights movement, and the labor movement. He characterized the student movement as strong, particularly at Tehran University, Amirkabir University, and Iran University of Science and Technology and said there are links between the student movement and the labor movement.   DUBAI 00000187  003.2 OF 003     - The IRIG is increasing its pressure on human rights and political activists in the run-up to the presidential election but has relaxed pressure against the general population.    -   Golestan province leans reformist, in part because the Friday Prayer Leader in the province, Seyyed Kazem Nourmofidi, is a reformer.  Ayatollah Khomeini appointed Nourmofidi to his position in 1979.  6. (S/NF) Another View on the "Year of Reforming Consumption": By declaring this the "year of reforming consumption," Supreme Leader Khamenei is telling the Majles that it should consider legislation to reform Iran's subsidy programs, an Ivy-League educated professor of economics at the American University of Sharjah (please protect) told IRPO econoff in a recent meeting. In his speech the SL carefully avoided endorsing AN's subsidy reform plan, the legislation for which is still pending before the Majles, although the Majles removed funding for the plan from this year's budget.  The academic contends that the SL is in favor of price increases for select items like water and electricity, and in favor of government rationing programs, but he is opposed to the broad price liberalization and direct cash payments that are key parts of AN's proposed legislation. Khamenei favors a larger government role in reforming consumption, and not the smaller role that the cash payment plan, which would give lower-income Iranians cash to spend on goods as they choose, would prescribe.  Comment:  This analysis of the SL's Nowruz speech is notable both for its nuance as well as its focus on economic policy differences between SLK and AN. IRPO has previously reported on several defeats that the Majles dealt AN on economic policy, and if the academic is correct, the Nowruz speech can also be interpreted as an attack on AN's policies.    7. (S/NF)  Armenian MP Comments on Politics and the Economy: The main issue in June's presidential election will be who can better manage Iran's economy, while personal freedoms will be of secondary importance, according to Robert Beglarian, one of two representatives of the Armenian community in the Majles. Beglarian is serving his second term in the Majles, after working for many years in the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Beglarian also commented that Majles Speaker Ali Larijani has been a better manager of the Majles than former Speaker Haddad Adel, but that the current Majles is less active than the previous one.  On economic issues, Beglarian thinks that the emphasis on the private sector in presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi's economic program should be interpreted as an attack on the strong role of the IRGC in the economy.  Beglarian asserted that the value-added tax (VAT), which spawned protests in several cities last fall, is currently being collected, and he is scheduled to give a seminar on the VAT in Esfahan. Comment:   The views of a current member of the Majles are always of interest, but his assertion that the VAT is currently being collected contradicts reporting from other IRPO contacts, although some Iranian press reports have said it may be implemented later this year.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000200  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  5/13/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PINR, CASC, ECON SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE - WINDOW ON IRAN - MAY 13, 2009  REF: STATE 47326  DUBAI 00000200  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office - Dubai, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. [S/NF] Iranian Media Largely Ignore Saberi's Release: Iranian official and semi-official media provided minimal reporting on the court decision to free Roxanna Saberi.  IRNA, for example, limited its coverage to a short, factual story quoting from foreign press sources. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi was shown on one state-run network announcing the decision and citing Saberi's cooperation, her expression of regret, and the Islamic principle of compassion as factors in the judges' decision to reduce her sentence.  Tabnak, the newspaper of former IRGC commander and presidential candidate Mohsen Rezai, ran a short article that raised the question of whether the Ahmadinejad government would now press for the release of Iranians in US custody in Iraq.  Comment: The dearth of official press on this story, like the President's Nowruz address, suggests strongly that the IRIG is nervous about public reaction to any story that might suggest a rush toward engagement with the US.    2. [S/NF] VOA Panelists Said to Advocate Election Boycott: A reform-minded IRPO contact complained to us that VOA recently aired a program in which panelists were calling for Iranians to boycott the presidential election.  She suggested other VOA programming had also featured speakers advocating that Iranians stay home from the polls.  Whether it was USG policy or not, she said, many Iranians would believe it was because it was being carried on VOA.  She also said that such appeals undermined VOA's credibility among its Iranian audience.  Comment: This is one of several complaints we've heard recently about VOA, as Iranians tell us that while still popular, VOA is seen as less objective and more removed from Iran than the BBC Persian Service. IRPO highlights this complaint particularly as it runs contrary to our stated policy of non-interference in the Iranian elections.  Furthermore and perhaps more important, low voter turnout may cast doubt on regime legitimacy, but will almost certainly ensure AN - who enjoys both a solid core constituency and incumbency advantages - will win.    3. [S/NF] MFA Spokesman Does Little to Clarify Existence of MFA Exchanges Commission:  During his weekly press conference, MFA spokesman Hassan Qashqavi was asked whether Iranian soccer team Persepolis would be allowed to tour the U.S. According to the translation being given during Press TV's live coverage, Qashqavi said that such travel is governed by "the committee" and it scrutinizes requested travel closely.  Clearly caught off guard by the question, Qashqavi stumbled in answering further, contradicting himself as to whether the committee was part of the MFA or a separate entity to which MFA provided input. Comment: A clear answer from Qashqavi would have officially confirmed the existence of the purported MFA Exchanges Committee.  His fumbling answer, and translation that was not perfect, leaves us with no better information on what role MFA may play in overseeing exchanges with the US.    4. [S/NF]   Mousavi's Attempt to Woo Academics Described as Uninspiring:  Two partners in a private equity fund based in Tehran described presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi's performance at a meeting with academics and intellectuals at the University of Tehran earlier this week as "uninspiring" and noted that any of the four professors who spoke before Mousavi would have made a more exciting candidate.  According to the contacts, Mousavi pointed to his ability to get funding for the Iranian Academy of Arts as one of his most significant recent managerial accomplishments, an example that left the audience less than dazzled.  They also mentioned that though Mousavi's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, did not address the audience, she sat at a table near the podium taking notes, several of which she passed to her husband during the Q&A session.  The senior fund manager observed that while he found Mousavi to be intelligent and straightforward, he attributed much of the support his campaign has earned so far directly to Khatami's endorsement and activity on behalf of Mousavi's candidacy.  He also said that former President Khatami's brother, Ali Khatami, requested a meeting with him in late April on behalf of his older brother to solicit the fund manager's support for Mousavi.  According to the contact, Mousavi made a conscious decision several weeks ago to fully engage Khatami's "star power" and fundraising  DUBAI 00000200  002.2 OF 003   potential, and in addition to now publicly campaigning with him, is asking Khatami to personally solicit financial support on behalf of the campaign.   Comment:  While their comments about Mousavi's demeanor at the University of Tehran meeting tracks with the conventional wisdom that he is not a charismatic candidate, other IRPO contacts have observed that during large rallies he is able to generate enthusiasm, although not on the level of Khatami.  The campaign for the support of academics and intellectual elites likely results from the numerous recent endorsements of Mehdi Karroubi by high-profile reformist thinkers such as Abbas Abdi, Ali Abtahi, and most recently, Abdolkarim Soroush.    5. [SBU]  IMF Predicts Solid Iran GDP Growth 2009-2010: On May 10, the IMF published its Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East, which projects 3.2 percent GDP growth for Iran in 2009 and 3.0 percent in 2010.   Growth in non-oil GDP is forecast at 4.0 percent in 2009 and 3.5 percent in 2010, with oil GDP contracting by -4.0 (2009) and -2.0 (2010).   The IMF's growth projections for Iran are higher than the forecasted regional average for oil exporters of 2.3 percent growth.   At a presentation of the report hosted by the Dubai International Financial Centre, IMF Director of the Middle East and South Asia Dr. Masood Ahmed noted that while the financial crisis has had a negative impact, the Middle East has been less impacted than most developing countries.  The IMF highlighted that inflation is trending downward worldwide due to falling demand and falling commodity prices.   In April, Iran's Central Bank reported that inflation had dropped to 19 percent and would continue to decline.  Comment: Global deflationary tendencies, rather than Central Bank inflation targeting, are likely responsible for this decrease in inflation.    6. [C]  Factory Owners Report Challenges, but No Crisis: Iranian factory owners applying for visas in Dubai have taken moderate steps to respond to the weakening Iranian economy. Specifically, a packaging materials factory has reduced wages for some employees; a paper manufacturing company has reduced their work day from three shifts to two shifts; and, a ladies underwear manufacturing company has cut back its workload by roughly 20 percent.  A plastics manufacturer reported that due to liquidity problems in Iran, he faces a two to three month delay in getting payments.  An iron importing company said demand from the factory they sell to has decreased the price they pay approximately 50 percent.  Still, the reports are not entirely negative.  A shampoo and soap manufacturing company said business is good and the company is hiring.    7. [C]  Iranian Businessman Offers Countervailing View of Public Sentiment toward the US:  An Iranian businessman in Dubai to pick up his visa estimated that 50-60 percent of Iranians oppose the resumption of official ties with the US. He explained that many Iranians are "illiterate" or "uneducated" and take to heart the IRIG's demonization of the USG. Continuing, he considers their opposition to the resumption of ties significant, forcing the IRIG to take gradual steps toward reconciliation.  The businessman also dismissed the potential, if reconciliation fails, for an anti-regime protest from those that want better ties with the US - he said such people, like himself, have no power at all in Iran.  Comment: IRPO conoff has met with the Iranian businessman before; he is involved in the construction industry and owns a fast food restaurant.  His view of Iran's "illiterates" should not be considered an authoritative assessment - he has not recently been to South Tehran, and similarly, probably has not ventured into Iran's rural areas to discuss these matters.  But his views still raise a few points. First, his comments suggest the IRIG is not and will not be responsive to domestic pressure to improve ties with the US. Second, Tehran may feel more pressure from the anti-US cohort, perhaps explaining Iran's own pre-conditions and the Iranian rhetoric surrounding engagement.  And finally, his views illustrate the disdain many elite Iranians have for their rural countrymen.    8. [S/NF]   Facade of American Embassy in Tehran Unchanged  DUBAI 00000200  003.2 OF 003   (reftel):  A Tehran-based investment fund manager, in response to a query about reports of anti-American propaganda being taken down in Tehran, reported that he saw the embassy compound on May 6 when he attended a meeting in a nearby office building.  He said the murals on the compound have not been painted over or covered in any way.    9.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 RPO DUBAI 000217  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  5/20/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN ELECTION SCENESETTER:  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIST ANNOUNCED, OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN PERIOD UNDERWAY  DUBAI 00000217  001.2 OF 004   CLASSIFIED BY: Ramin Asgard, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.(C) Summary:  The Guardians Council-approved list of four candidates eligible to stand in Iran's June 12 presidential election included no surprises.  President Ahmadinejad remains the man to beat, but is the object of persistent and withering criticism from his three rivals, particularly for his poor stewardship of the economy and for exacerbating Iran's international isolation.  Mir Hossein Mousavi, the 1980s prime minister whose candidacy is fueled in great part by former president Khatami's endorsement, is viewed as Ahmadinejad's strongest rival.  However, the outspoken former Majles Speaker Mehdi Karrubi showed well in the 2005 election and has drawn the support of many well-known reformers.  The fourth candidate, former Revolutionary Guards Commander Mohsen Reza'i, is not expected to win a substantial number of votes, but his participation exposes rifts within the conservative elite and gives other prominent principlists cover to not publicly support Ahmadinejad.    2. (C) Summary (cont.): If all four candidates stay in the race, they are likely to split the vote sufficiently to require a second round of voting on June 19.  A two-man race -- in which only one opponent would benefit from the likely substantial anti-Ahmadinejad vote -- could leave the incumbent vulnerable. Though vote manipulation will likely favor Ahmadinejad and he is presumed to be the preferred candidate of Supreme Leader Khamenei, Iran's leadership places great importance on the appearance of electoral propriety; it is unlikely Ahmadinejad would be able to steal the election outright, nor that Khamenei would be able to deliver the election to him.    Candidate Announcement Brings Some Clarity to Iranian Election  --------------------------------------------- -----------------    3. (C) The Guardians Council (GC) certified the candidacies of the election's four leading figures: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, former Majles Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, and former IRGC Commander and current Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Reza'i.  None of the other 471 people who registered to contest the election met the GC's interpretation of the constitution's eligibility definition.    4. (C) The challengers for the presidency have roundly criticized Ahmadinejad for the confrontational spin he has put on Iranian foreign policy and especially for his mismanagement of the economy.  However, on the matters of greatest concern to the USG, namely the nuclear issue and engagement with the USG, the contenders differ only marginally from Ahmadinejad. Mousavi, Karrubi, and Reza'i all reject out of hand an enrichment suspension and applaud the achievements of Iran's nuclear scientists.  Their general support for the status quo is both an acknowledgment of popular sentiment -- advocating suspension is not tenable under current conditions -- as well as the Supreme Leader's recognized primacy regarding the nuclear issue.  All the candidates have similarly fallen in line behind Khamenei regarding engagement with the USG; each has voiced some variation of the Supreme Leader's Nowruz address wherein he said rhetorical change is not enough, they want to see US conduct towards Iran change. Moussavi, Karrubi and Reza'i have, however, noted the importance of ending Iran's international isolation and have suggested a more realist and less ideological tilt to their likely foreign policy in their comments.    5. (C)  Even on the economy, where high inflation and rising unemployment have made Ahmadinejad an easy target, his opponents have largely asserted that they favor better or more efficient management.  None of the challengers has outlined an economic agenda for structural reform of the state-dominated economy; rather, they have tried to highlight Ahmadinejad's erratic approach to economic policy and personnel decisions and the perception that he has squandered Iran's oil windfall of recent years.  Mousavi, deriding the President's failure to deliver on his 2005 campaign promises, observed that "social justice does not mean the equal distribution of poverty"  in one such attack.  Yet despite being a focal point of the candidates' rhetoric, the election does not portend the dramatic changes needed to  DUBAI 00000217  002.2 OF 004   improve Iran's economy.    6. (C)  Where the challengers do differ with Ahmadinejad is their tone and in this regard, they have taken steps to distance themselves from Ahmadinejad's rhetoric.  Mousavi has spoken of initiating a policy of "ditente" with the rest of the world; Karrubi criticized Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust and called the President's inflammatory remarks a favor to Israel; even Reza'i, a conservative and former IRGC commander, said Iran under Ahmadinejad is heading toward an "abyss " and should "neither pursue passivity or adventurism."  All three men seek to be regarded as a competent manager capable of repairing the damage incurred during Ahmadinejad's tenure.    The Candidates  --------------    7. (C)  President Ahmadinejad remains the candidate to beat: he has an incumbent's advantages of media coverage and control of Iran's coffers, and support from key institutions charged with overseeing the election.  Still, his re-election is not a foregone conclusion and two questions define his electoral prospects: his standing with Supreme Leader Khamenei and his reservoir of support in the provinces.  Despite Khamenei's public assurances that he has only "one vote," many still worry that he will tilt the system in favor of Ahmadinejad.  Khamenei raised such fears in a recent speech when his description of his ideal candidate sounded similar to Ahmadinejad. However, the description was generic enough to match other candidates as well.    8. (C)  Ahmadinejad's support base includes radical hardliners who approve of the president's defiance of the international community, and the urban and rural poor, who identify with Ahmadinejad's piety and simple lifestyle.  With the hardline vote relatively assured, the president is depending on getting the same provincial support he received in 2005 to win.  In the last election, Ahmadinejad's promises of "social justice" were a key to his victory.  He repeatedly returned to such themes during his provincial trips, making grand promises of economic development everywhere he went. However, many of his promises remain unfulfilled and the economy has faltered, leaving his degree of support in the provinces an unknown.    9. (C) Former Prime Minister Mousavi has emerged as the leading challenger to Ahmadinejad.  Out of politics since the 1980s, Mousavi says he is returning to the fray because "things are not going well in this country."  He is counting on a coalition of the youth and those that fondly remember his stewardship during the Iran-Iraq war.  While on the one hand championing human rights, the rule of law, and disbanding the "Morals Police," he has adopted the color green for his campaign to highlight his religious pedigree (Note: The title "Mir" is a rarely used term synonymous with "Seyyed," designating a descendant of the prophet) and is running on a promise to return Iran to the "pure values" of the Islamic Revolution.  Trying to bridge the difference, Mousavi maintains he is running as an independent; that said, nearly all of the leading reformist organizations back him.    10. (C)  According to our contacts, however, Mousavi is not a charismatic campaigner.  His challenge --  shared by all in the anti-Ahmadinejad camp -- will be to draw out the urban vote.  In recent national elections, voter participation in the provinces has outpaced turnout in urban areas, where the president is least popular.  Without a strong turnout, Mousavi will be hard pressed to overcome Ahmadinejad's inherent advantages. Mousavi, though initially reluctant to be lumped in with Khatami as a reformer, eventually yielded to Khatami's star power and the two have been campaigning together and Khatami is shown prominently on Mousavi's campaign posters.    DUBAI 00000217  003.2 OF 004    11. (C) Regime stalwart and 2005 presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi returns to the fray determined to avenge his bitter, and perhaps fraud-tainted, defeat four years ago.  When the polls closed Karrubi stood in second place in the vote and in position to join Expediency Council Chairman Rafsanjani in a runoff only to wake up the next day to find himself in third place, behind Ahmadinejad and out of the runoff.  But despite his strong showing in the first round in 2005, Karrubi now is viewed mostly as a foil to the other candidates, but whether he draws more votes from Ahmadinejad or Mousavi is unclear.  Karrubi is an economic populist, promising cash payments and oil shares to Iran's population, putting him in direct competition for voters who support Ahmadinejad's populism.  He also champions human rights and the rights of Iran's ethnic minorities (Note: Karrubi is from the Lur ethnic minority), issues that Mousavi is trying to make his own.  Perhaps tellingly, reformers have repeatedly requested Karrubi to withdraw in favor of Mousavi, a request he repeatedly denies.    12. (C) Former IRGC Commander and Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Reza'i was the last of the four to announce his bid and only did so after months of publicly trying to find a candidate to head a so-called unity government.  When no one else emerged, he announced his own candidacy.  Reza'i, a conservative, is banned from international travel because of an Interpol red notice stemming from his allegedly involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Argentina.  As in 2005, when he withdrew two days before the election, Reza'i has little chance of winning the election; his candidacy though highlights the disdain of many in the principlist factions for President Ahmadinejad.  There is speculation that various conservatives and rivals to Ahmadinejad are assisting Mousavi's campaign. Reza'i's presence has allowed other prominent principlists to avoid endorsing a candidate because two conservatives are in the field.    What to Look For  ----------------    13. (C) The government's announcement of the official candidates signals the start of the election's official campaign period. The campaign period runs until June 10, just ahead of the June 12 election. Although the candidates have effectively been campaigning for months, the designated period will carry much more official media coverage.  The state-run media has announced six debates between the candidates as well as individual Q&A sessions.  The candidates themselves have promised press conferences; Ahmadinejad, for example, will be holding separate press conferences for domestic and international press later this month to officially launch his re-election bid.    14. (C) The media environment to date and in the run up to the election is a point of contention among the candidates. Ahmadinejad's opponents have complained about bias in the state-run media, accusing Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) of exaggerating Ahmadinejad's accomplishments and providing extensive coverage to his provincial trips.  However, The IRIB is under Supreme Leader Khamenei's control and its chief asserts the IRIB is impartial.  Perhaps to illustrate that point, the IRIB recently cancelled an interview with Ahmadinejad and did not cover a provincial speech.  The president's backers have also complained that IRIB managers favor Mousavi.  Still, Ahmadinejad, as president, will probably command a greater share of the coverage during the month-long official campaign period -- a significant advantage because most Iranians, particularly rural populations, still receive their news from IRIB.  The candidates are embracing new media venues to attract voters, such as Facebook, but only a small segment of the population is savvy enough to use such technology and it is unlikely to overcome Ahmadinejad's traditional media advantage.    Potential for Fraud  -------------------  DUBAI 00000217  004.2 OF 004      15. (C) There are also allegations that Ahmadinejad will benefit from fraud in the election. Iranian elections are not free and fair; but beyond the Guardian Council's vetting --  this year 471 candidates were rejected -- the nature of electoral malfeasance and its significance is hard to gauge. Fears of fraud have increased this year because the GC and the Ministry of Interior, which oversee and carry out the election, are both aligned with Ahmadinejad.  Guardians Council Secretary Janati recently made pointed comments supporting Ahmadinejad's re-election and Interior Minister Mahsuli, the president's campaign manager in 2005, was appointed to his post last fall.    16. (C) The GC certifies the results of the election and invalidates district votes they deem irregular.  As such, the GC can throw out or alter results in particular districts.  Karrubi and his campaign spokesman in 2005 accused the GC of this sort of tampering in particular districts.  The Ministry of Interior, for its part, has control over the ballot boxes, giving rise to concerns for their protection/sanctity. All the candidates are allowed to station observers at each voting station, but the candidates likely do not have the staff to send representatives to all the polling booths.    17. (C) The losing candidates in 2005 also complained about the mobilization of the Basij, the IRGC's militia, on behalf of Ahmadinejad.  Basij members are thought to constitute much of Ahmadinejad's base and are expected to support the President again.    18. (C) The election will in all likelihood see some degree of fraud and many such accusations.  Still, the IRIG and Khamenei look to Iranian elections to validate the legitimacy of the regime.  In the run up to the election Khamenei and his minions will repeatedly exhort Iranians to the polls in order to showcase the strength of the regime and "neutralize the enemies' plots."  They do not want the who should also provide a check, if only a small one, against widespread fraud. election to be seen as a farce, which likely limits their willingness to overtly meddle.  And although the IRIG does not permit the presence of foreign election observers, Iran has accredited nearly 200 foreign journalists    Comment:  --------    19. (C) Iranian foreign policy and nuclear program are, to a large extent, dictated by Supreme Leader Khamenei and the Supreme National Security Council as a function of Iran's perceived national interests.  However, the president can affect foreign policy by force of his "bully pulpit," as we have seen both for the positive (Khatami) and the negative (Ahmadinejad). The election does not portend dramatic changes in Iranian policies of greatest concern to the U.S., but a new tone and new face for Iran, if Ahmadinejad is defeated, will strengthen the voices inside the country who favor pragmatism over confrontation.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (SBU)  Candidate Snapshot of the Iranian Presidential Election: The Ministry of Interior today announced the Guardians Council-approved final candidate list.  As expected, the four leading candidates - Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mir Hosein Mousavi, Mehdi Karrubi, and Mohsen Reza'i - are the only sanctioned contenders for the June 12 election.  An election scenesetter is being sent septel.    2. (S/NF) Saberi, the US and AN's Election Prospects: An IRPO contact with direct access to IRIG officials told us May 16 that President Ahmadinejad had been directly responsible for the release of Roxanna Saberi.  Our source then implied a linkage between Saberi's release and hoped-for U.S. "actions" toward engagement with Iran before the election that might boost Ahmadinejad's re-election.  Ahmadinejad, he argued, was committed to engaging the United States, and the best candidate for the success of any rapprochement and for Iran in general. Our contact acknowledged that his re-election prospects, however, were at best 50-50, and likely worse.  Leaving aside the presidential election, our contact said that Supreme Leader Khamenei and his advisers are moving toward a policy of engagement.  He maintained that Khamenei, during his tour of Kordestan, had demonstrably toned down direct criticism of the United States and that it was indicative of the change in Supreme Leader's thinking.  Comment: Our contact did not dwell on Saberi and AN's election and only raised it in passing.  We doubt he raised it at the behest of the AN campaign, but it is possibly further evidence that Ahmadinejad is hoping for a breakthrough with the US to improve his chances for re-election.     3. (S/NF) Iran's Third GSM License May Be Retendered: According to an IRPO business contact with regular access to senior Iranian commercial circles, the recent withdrawal of the UAE's telecomm giant Etisalat (additional reporting septel), and substitution with Kuwait's Zain, as recipients of Iran's third GSM license may be a harbinger of even greater shakeups to come.  This source noted that the chair of the Iran Arab Cooperation Board [NFN Husaini] traveled to Oman this past week to explore whether OmanTel, Oman's telecomm carrier, had sufficient interest in the GSM license to warrant possible retendering. Further, he passed along that the Iranians are willing to consider bringing in a US telecomm firm as Omantel's partner. Comment: As with many such tenders in this region, this huge contract has become heavily politicized.  With billions at stake, Iran appears to be shopping this lucrative license among various regional players and weighing various foreign policy benefits in the process.  The suggested addition of a US carrier, if this can be verified, may bring the politicization of this deal to a qualitatively higher level.    4. (S/NF) Evidence of Supreme Leader-Mousavi Reconciliation?: An IRPO business contact with connections to the Mousavi campaign recounted to IRPO Officers a recent Supreme Leader visit to Mir Hossein Mousavi's home, a story that has also circulated on the internet.  Mousavi's elderly father was gravely ill, and the SL reportedly spent two hours alone with Mousavi on the occasion. Contact pointed out that this visit is being considered as a show of great respect to Mousavi, and that we should not presume that the reported twenty-year old feud between the SL and Mousavi still embittered their relationship.    5. (S/NF) State Media Outlets Seek Help in Establishing U.S. Presence:  An Iranian journalist working for a Western news service told us that he recently was approached by Iranian officials seeking help in getting accreditation for IRIB and Fars News Agency to place reporters in the U.S.  The IRIG official told our contact that a request had been denied by the Department.  Our contact said that he suspected the timing of the Iranian request was tied to accreditation of Western journalists covering the Iranian election.  Comment:  We have heard no complaints from any Western press contacts here that visas or accreditation requests have been denied.  IRNA reported about 190 foreign correspondents have applied to cover the presidential elections in Iran.     DUBAI 00000218  002.2 OF 003   6. (S/NF) Iranian Film Director on the Iranian Film Scene:  A renowned Iranian film director told us that the Ministry of Culture is Iran is "anti-culture" and was one more frustration that Iranians had to contend with under Ahmadinejad.  He said the Ministry will give film makers permission to begin shooting a film but often will deny permission to show it in Iran.  This arbitrary treatment has left many directors of films deemed too sensitive for Iranians with no outlet other than foreign film festivals.  The director said Iranian film makers and actors are publicly critical of the IRIG at these festivals, and he was unaware of any being punished for it when they return.  Iranian officials have become increasingly accepting of satellite broadcasts and even show American movies on IRIB, he said, in large part because they recognize that movies and television shows produced for propaganda have little influence among the Iranian public.  Comment: Our contact was highly critical of Ahmadinejad and told us he was working with Mir Hossein Mousavi's campaign, but he also had little expectation that a Mousavi victory would bring about real change as long as the Supreme Leader was in place.    7. (C) Women's Professional Soccer Broadcast into Iran:  The Los Angeles-based satellite channel Iran TV (also known as ITN) began broadcasting women's professional soccer matches into Iran three weeks ago.  The games, which are played between teams belonging to the newly-created Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) league, are aired weekly on Wednesday evenings during prime television hours.  According to the producer, the broadcasts have drawn a tremendous response from viewers inside Iran, who are especially appreciative of the fact that the commentators, a man and women, are native Farsi speakers.  The producer said that during the fifteen-minutes live call-in period following each match, viewers from Iran (and a few from Afghanistan) have "inundated" the channel's phone lines with overwhelmingly positive comments from both men and women.  The broadcasts will continue through the end of the season in late August.  Comment:  Soccer is wildly popular in Iran and became a hot button gender issue in 2006 when Ahmadinejad attempted to relax the prohibition against women attending matches, only to be reversed by the Supreme Leader, who sided with clerics concerned about the affect viewing men in shorts could have on women's morality.    8. (S/NF) Farsi One TV Set to Debut in Late June: In discussions with Farsi TV executives (joint venture which includes StarTV, a NewsCorp subsidiary), IRPO learned that this entertainment channel featuring American programming dubbed in Fars) in late June.  Comment: Given the availability of Fox television programming, IRPO is urging Farsi One to reconsider its decision not to run the Simpsons.    9. (S/NF)  Tehran Stock Exchange Striving to Meet International Standards:  The Iranian manager of a medium-sized private equity fund that invests in the Tehran Stock Exchange described significant improvements in the quality of the bourse's management in the three years since his fund was established. He observed that the TSE was the only positively performing bourse in the world in 2008 and is much more dynamic exchange that commonly understood outside of Iran.  He said that government-affiliated funds, such as the national pension fund, make up sixty percent of the market.  While the TSE remains badly over-regulated and at $50 billion is still very small, in his opinion the situation has improved dramatically in recent years.  While still not meeting international operating standards, it is making progress: he said the TSE is now "legitimately" private,  and that in an effort to improve transparency (and thus attract increased investment), companies listed on the bourse compelled to publish quarterly reports substantiated by accounting firm that have been pre-approved by TSE management.  The fund manager noted that the regulation compelling investors to keep their money inside Iran for a minimum of three years remains a major obstacle to attracting foreign investment, and that the two percent foreign ownership figure officially cited by the TSE is likely untrue. Bureaucracy and over-regulation still hamper the TSE, but he said he has not encountered any overt corruption there. When asked about the profitability of investing in the TSE, he answered with a broad smile and predicted it would only improve because the fundamentals of the Iranian economy, in particular the famous youth bulge, will not change.  He described the banking sector as the easiest place to make money right now in  DUBAI 00000218  003.2 OF 003   Iran. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF)  Trilateral Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan Summit in Tehran:  On May 24 the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan participated in a trilateral summit hosted by the IRIG intended to, in the words of Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki, develop mechanisms to find "regional solutions for regional problems." The three presidents issued a 24-point "Tehran Declaration" in which they agree to create a mechanism for regular meetings at either the ministerial or head of state level; cooperate to eliminate terrorism; take "urgent steps" to develop infrastructure connectivity between the three countries; and to create pull factors in Afghanistan to facilitate the voluntary return of Afghans to their homeland; among others.  The declaration also establishes a coordination committee of the three Deputy Foreign Ministers to prepare a comprehensive action plan and monitor progress of trilateral coordination.  The next summit meeting is scheduled for Islamabad in October 2009. Comment: This meeting also featured final agreement between Iran and Pakistan to commence construction of the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.  This "Peace Pipeline" project was originally to include India, but given India's reluctance press reports are already speculating that China may step in to join the project. In addition, Russia's Gazprom has already voiced interest in investing in the pipeline.  With the next Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit scheduled for June in Yekaterinburg, Russia, we can expect such energy security issues to feature prominently, particularly as Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are currently observers and prospective members of the SCO.    2. (S/NF)  American journalist denied visa as message to USG: An American journalist with a major wire service told us Iranian authorities have denied him a visa to cover the elections.  He said IRIG officials told him it was in response to US refusals to issue visas to Iranian reporters and accredit Iranian news outlets.  Other journalists working for his news service have received visas, he said, and the Iranians refused him, after allowing him into the country more than two dozen times in the past several years, as a message.  He also said that Iranian staff of the news service had reported more intense pressure from Iranian security agents recently.  Comment: As we reported in last week's WoI, Iranian officials are eager to get Iranian journalists into the US and believe that denying this, and potentially other visas in the future, might get their message across.    3. (S/NF) Soccer as Political Football: The Iranian press has reported extensively this week on the potential friendly matches between the US and Iranian men's and women's teams. Iranian officials have been quoted agreeing to the matches, although US Soccer officials are more circumspect.  Ahmadinejad deputy and Iran sports chief Mohammad Ali-Abadi was quick to endorse the match.  According to US Soccer information, there was no serious discussion between the US and Iranian federations, but simply some mutual interest in potential match.  Comment: Iranians are passionate about soccer, and we can't help but think that the timing of this announcement with presidential campaigns in full swing is hardly coincidental.  Many of our contacts have told us that Ahmadinejad's electoral fortunes are tied to the performance of the national team in its upcoming World Cup qualifiers, and its possible that his campaign is hoping for some political benefit from a soccer-mad public if it can be seen to be improving relations with the US, if nowhere else but the soccer pitch.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF)  Rivals Eroding AN's Purportedly Solid Base of Support: After discussing election developments with a broad range of contacts, it appears that in combination, AN's three rivals can strip him of a substantial number of votes from his base.  A few of this week's entries refer to this situation, and we have attached a graphic to highlight this trend.    2. (S/NF)  Reformist Election as Proxy Battle Between Khamenei and Rafsanjani: IRPO officers met on June 1 and 2 with a reformist former Khatami campaign official (and son of Khatami's former vice president) and a Rezai supporter to discuss the election.  The reformist portrayed the election, as numerous other contacts have, as a proxy showdown between Supreme Leader Khamenei and Expediency Council Chair Hashemi Rafsanjani.  He noted that Rafsanjani was either directly or indirectly funding all three of Ahmadinejad's challengers.  He argued that, possibly based upon a strategy devised by Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad's rivals have combined to erode his base of support. Karroubi, Mousavi, and Rezai all target key constituencies thought to represent a solid AN voting block (the rural poor, the IRGC and Basij, Leftists, traditional religious citizens, financial opportunists).  Comment: Public comments from Ahmadinejad insiders appear to support the idea that this race is in some ways a reprise of the 2005 second round contest between Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad campaign manager Samareh-Hashemi was recently quoted as complaining that the President was not running against Karroubi, Mousavi and Rezai, but rather "Hashemi, Hashemi, and Hashemi. " (Note: Hashemi refers to Expediency Council head Rafsanjani.)    3. (S/NF)  Rezai Insider Outlines the Candidate's Determination to Stay in Race:  A former IRGC General and close associate of presidential candidate Mohsen Rezai said that the IRGC co-founder is determined to stay in the race, and will not withdraw shortly before the election as he did in 2005. According to the contact, Rezai is seriously aiming to win the election and believes his candidacy is viable. Second, he believes that even if he does not ultimately prevail, he will take a substantial number of votes from Ahmadinejad, primarily from his conservative base.  Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, the contact said Rezai believes that his participation as a candidate will help contain IRGC and Basij-driven election fraud.  As another contact pointed out in a discussion of the likelihood of malfeasance, there are currently 95,000 Basij bases in Iran, each staffed with an average of 25 Basijis, amounting to a significant pool of potentially fraudulent voters.    4. (S/NF) Former Guardians Council Member: AN Will Win if Top Rival Gets Less than Five Million More Votes:  In a June 3 meeting with IRPO, a former Guardians Council member explained that Khamenei preferred a president who would be his "servant," and AN fit that description.  The other three candidates, he noted, came up with Khamenei and are heavyweights in their own right.  For this reason, he was advancing his preference for AN.  This contact recounted that Khamenei had told a recent meeting of the Assembly of Experts that AN was best for the health of the country.  He reported that a number of the Assembly members - the only body constitutionally empowered to remove the leader - got up and walked out at this statement.  As IRPO has reported earlier, Khamenei has given AN virtually unlimited financial backing.  The former GC member told us, as many contacts have, that five million blank identity documents are ready to help sway the election outcome to AN.  So, he concluded, if someone is going to defeat AN, they will have to do it by more than  the five million vote "margin of fraud. "    5. (S/NF)  Rezai Supporter Outlines the Importance of the Debates:  According to the former IRGC general referenced above, the debates will be very important, because just as is in the US, many average people would make their voting decision based upon candidate performances in debates.  It was one thing, he continued, for a candidate to present his positions in a speech or in an interview, but in a debate he had to defend his record and his campaign positions against a rival's attacks.  This observer, who as noted is in regular touch with Rezai, as  DUBAI 00000232  002.2 OF 002   well as indirectly with the other campaigns, considered Rezai-Ahmadinejad, scheduled for 9:15 pm on June 9th, the most important debate.  He thought because of AN's vociferous and confrontational style, AN would probably get the better of the urbane Mousavi in their debate.  He noted that AN's main weakness in the debates was having to defend his track record as president.    6. (S/NF) As for AN -Karroubi, he thought Karroubi could do a much better job standing up to AN.  Moreover, Karroubi's clerical credentials went far with the types of rural constituencies AN hoped to dominate.  This former general described Karroubi as a lobbyer and a conciliator, who was adept at bringing disparate groups into consensus.  Nonetheless, he noted that rumors continue to plague Karroubi about his "corrupt" activities while head of the Bonyad-e Shahid (Martyr's Foundation).  He explained that this corrupt activity consisted of Karroubi taking 160 war martyr's wives as sighehs (temporary marriage), which many find a highly objectionable misuse of public office.    7. (S/NF) On the Rezai-AN debate, he said Rezai was forceful enough a speaker and thinker to "break" AN in the debate format.  Given AN's many failings, which Rezai's website Tabnak (formerly Baztab) have highlighted in detail for the last few years, Rezai may be able to greatly embarrass AN.   In Rezai's view, AN's misguided foreign and economic policies and reckless rhetoric have damaged Iran's global standing and are ruining the Islamic Republic.  If Rezai can score a knockout in this debate so close to the election, he could swing many votes away from AN.  Meanwhile, Rezai's only apparent vulnerability is his son's defection to the U.S. and subsequent misadventures.  This Rezai confidante felt his candidate could easily counter this attack if AN tried to pursue it.    8. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad Feeling the Heat on Economy?:  An Iranian consultant in the oil and gas sector offered his opinion that Ahmadinejad is taking desperate measures to paint his presidency as good for the economy. The consultant pointed to the convenient disbursal of $20,000 to Majles deputies and reported payments to nurses and civil servants, that have drawn criticism from Hassan Rowhani and Mehdi Karroubi, as well as Ahmadinejad's claim that his critics are liars. The president's renewed focus on corruption also  suggest he is concerned that his opponents focus on rising inflation and unemployment may resonate with the public. Our contact also observed that Mehdi Karroubi's promise to pay dividends in oil revenues and increase if along with oil prices has worried Ahmadinejad. On the other hand, while Iran's Judiciary has warned Ahmadinejad from exposing economic criminals that have not been indicted by the Judiciary, this could allow Ahmadinejad to paint himself as the victim in a struggle against Iran's elite.    9.(C/NF) Similarities Abound, But Oil Revenue Separates Candidates:  A review of Mehdi Karrubi's, Mir Hossein Mousavi's, and Mohsen Rezai's economic platforms reveals that the strongest disagreement between the candidates is the mechanism by which they would distribute oil revenues among the population. Mousavi and Rezai support depositing at least a portion of Iran's oil revenues into a National Development Fund as the catalyst for capital investment. Both candidates also lean heavily towards investing in the private sector as the only means to attract foreign investors and achieve growth. Karrubi maintains that he too supports the private sector, but continues to focus on giving shares of oil revenues directly to Iranians, a move both Rezai and Mousavi have criticized. ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)   1. (C) Summary: The much-anticipated live debate between President Ahmadinejad and his chief rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, was a watershed event in which Ahmadinejad broke long-standing taboos by leveling allegations of corruption at senior regime officials and attacking the academic credentials of Mousavi's wife. Ahmadinejad's attempt to portray himself as a victim beset by an alliance of powerful establishment figures was met with derision by his opponent, who portrayed the incumbent as a radical who has endangered Iran through his delusional foreign policy and erratic management of the economy. The unusually adversarial nature of the exchange will likely further polarize the June 12 election, which Ahmadinejad already characterized as "three against one." The series of televised debates continues this evening as Mousavi faces Mohsen Rezai, a co-founder of the Revolutionary Guards and a long-time Ahmadinejad critic.  2. (C) Mousavi and Ahmadinejad squared off last night on prime time television in the second live debate of the campaign season. The confrontational nature and directness of the candidates' criticism of each other was unprecedented in contemporary Iranian political discourse. Ahmadinejad went on the attack immediately, attempting to link his rival to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - a towering figure in Iran since the Revolution who is widely considered to have used his many positions of power over the years to amass vast wealth and influence for himself and his family. (Note: Ahmadinejad defeated Rafsanjani in the second round of the 2005 presidential election and the little-known Ahmadinejad is widely thought to have benefited from a significant anti-Rafsanjani vote.) Throughout the 90-minute debate, Ahmadinejad sought to portray the campaigns of his three rivals as an elaborate plot devised by Rafsanjani and other establishment figures to get rid of him to regain their monopoly of Iran's power and resources. He also tried to pre-empt criticism of the economy - long considered his biggest vulnerability in this race and the object of relentless criticism from his opponents - by blaming earlier governments for Iran's economic woes.  3. (C) In response, Mousavi disparaged virtually every aspect of Ahmadinejad's conduct in office, from his provocative foreign policy to his erratic economic policy decisions, and accused him of leading Iran into "dictatorship." He strongly insinuated that Ahmadinejad suffers from delusions, deriding the President's allegations of kidnapping plots against him during foreign travel. "Should we," Mousavi asked rhetorically, "let our imaginations grow so much that they turn into our foreign policy? " He also mocked the President for threatening to execute the British sailors detained in 2007 then dressing them up in suits and giving them a send-off worthy of visiting dignitaries, and decried Ahmadinejad's four unanswered letters to Presidents Bush and Obama as an insult to Iran's dignity. Mousavi characterized the President's frequent invocation of the Holocaust as folly that undermined the country's standing.  4. (C) These attacks gave Ahmadinejad the opening to trumpet his version of Iran's foreign policy accomplishments during the tenure of his presidency. He countered that releasing the Britons had been a "beautiful act" on behalf of Iran and only followed a written apology from Prime Minister Blair, as well as pledges from the U.K. to change its behavior toward Iran. Ahmadinejad triumphantly noted that after 27 years of trying to bring about regime change in Iran, only after he took over the presidency did the U.S. Government change its policy and want to sit down at a table with Tehran.  5. (C) Throughout the debate, Ahmadinejad made good on his public threat last week to "expose" his opponents' and their associates by accusing Rafsanjani and his son of stealing oil money, and former Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri and his son of living off of bribery. He also attacked the campaign manager of another candidate for corruption during his tenure as mayor of Tehran in the 1990s. Ahmadinejad capped off his naming and shaming by brandishing a photograph of Mousavi's wife, an important political figure in her own right, and accusing her of having circumvented correct university entrance procedures.   Iranians React  6. (C) Iranians watching the live debate with IRPO officer gasped audibly at several points during the heated exchange. Our contacts explained that the initial pointed criticism by each candidate of the other was itself a sharp break from the tradition of indirect criticism in political discourse in Iran. Most shocking, however, were Ahmadinejad's allegations of corruption against several pillars of the Islamic Republic. The charges are widely known among Iranians, but had not been previously been leveled in a public forum by a leading government figure.  7. (C) Most Iranian media outlets are closed today for the national observance of the twentieth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death; however bloggers lit up the internet after the debate and scores of videos of post-debate revelry and street confrontations have already been posted on Youtube and elsewhere. In them, raucous crowds are shown pouring into the streets of major urban centers following the debates, with reports of crowds of Ahmadinejad supporters facing off with Mousavi followers. Though no consensus winner has emerged from the debate, Iranians seem largely in awe of the unprecedented poltical spectacle. In particular, the corruption allegations are the subject of much online chatter. As one Iranian from Isfahan observed on Facebook, "I can't believe what I saw tonight. I hate Ahmadinejad, but he is the only one crazy enough to say all those ugly truths."  8. (C) At Imam Khomeini's mausoleum this morning, in an address to mark his death, Supreme Leader Khamenei touched on the upcoming election. Though he did not specifically reference the debate, he said that it is wrong to say that Iran has been humiliated on the world stage, a clear signal to Ahmadinejad's rivals to tone down this line of attack. He also warned candidates' to treat each other with courtesy, and ensure that their disagreements do not spill over into the street. He also reiterated the line from his March 21 Mashhad speech in which he reminded Iranians that he only has one vote and that his vote will remain secret.   Comment  9. (C) In this debate, Ahmadinejad made clear that he is trying to run as the anti-establishment candidate, a difficult maneuver for any incumbent to pull off gracefully. Yet among the rural and urban poor who constitute Ahmadinejad's electoral base, the sentiment that the elite have benefited at the expense of average Iranian is powerful and pervasive. The President's argument hinges on his ability to convince voters that he is the true political heir of the Islamic Revolution, and that the presidents who preceded him - Rafsanjani and Khatami - were aberrations from the original revolutionary goals. Similarly, Ahmadinejad is forcefully ascribing criticism of Iran's economic performance under his watch to the same political actors who are trying to unseat him now, arguing that the problems cited by his critics, namely high inflation and unemployment, have always existed. On the other hand, Mousavi is seeking to portray Ahmadinejad as an unstable, radicalized, destructive deviation from Iran's proper revolutionary course. In many ways, the June 12 election will be a vote on whose version of history wins. There can be little doubt however, that this debate has further polarized voters as the election seems to increasingly be a referendum on Ahmadinejad himself.   ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  As emotions run high following a week of adversarial debates between Iran's four presidential candidates, the outcome of the national soccer team's World Cup qualifying match against the UAE could add to voters' dissatisfaction with Ahmadinejad just 36 hours before they head to the polls. President Ahmadinejad has worked hard to associate himself with Iran's beloved national team - "Team Melli" - a tactic that backfired in March when he was accused of "jinxing" the team, which suffered a last-minute defeat to Saudi Arabia just after Ahmadinejad entered the stadium.  That event, coupled with an unexpected loss by the national wrestling team with Ahmadinejad in attendance earlier in the year, set off a firestorm of SMS messages and internet jokes holding the President personally responsible for the teams' defeats, and has led numerous IRPO contacts to predict - only partially in jest - that a loss to the UAE team in Tehran on June 10 could further weaken Ahmadinejad's standing among soccer-crazed Iranians.  End summary.    MIXING SPORTS AND POLITICS  --------------------------    2.  (SBU) Since British oil workers first introduced the sport to Iranians in the early 20th century, soccer has developed into one of Iran's most popular past times, rivaled only by wrestling.  Although the Islamic Revolution and Iran-Iraq War hindered the development of professional soccer in Iran until the early 1990's, Team Melli came into international prominence in 1998 when it made its World Cup debut in France.  Although Iran failed to advance beyond the first round, Team Melli's memorable 2-1 victory over the U.S., in what was considered to be a particularly friendly and sportsmanlike match, cemented the national team's standing in the eyes of many Iranians.    3.  (C) As a result of its enormous domestic fan base, soccer has become highly politicized in Iran.  According to an IRPO contact closely involved with Iranian professional soccer, the Iranian government is well aware of the potential domestic unrest that can result from a Team Melli loss - or even win. Iran's successful World Cup qualifiers in 1997 and 2005 resulted in massive celebrations in the streets of Tehran, marked by public intoxication, dancing, and women removing their hijabs, while Team Melli's elimination from the 2001 World Cup qualifiers led to rioting.  Contacts tell IRPO that the Iranian government worries that public unrest over a Team Melli loss could add fire to the increasingly volatile political demonstrations that have paralyzed Tehran in recent nights.    4.  (C) President Ahmadinejad, in particular, has staked a great deal of political capital in Iranian soccer.  A personal fan and former player, Ahmadinejad has made several press appearances practicing with Team Melli.  In an effort to capitalize on soccer's popularity with constituents, Ahmadinejad, a political conservative, went so far as to call for the inclusion of women at men's games in 2006, although he was overruled by Supreme Leader Khamenei in a rare, but significant, open disagreement between the two men.  As a direct result of Ahmadinejad's close ties to Iran's national soccer team, several European politicians and Jewish groups unsuccessfully lobbied for Iran's disqualification from the 2006 World Cup.  After the team's poor performance in the World Cup qualifiers, Ahmadinejad fired Team Melli's coach in June 2006, reportedly for "damaging national pride," and launched an investigation into corruption in the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI).  In November 2006, the Fidiration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) temporarily disqualified Team Melli from international tournaments for Ahmadinejad's repeated violations of FIFA's political interference rules.    THE GEORGE STEINBRENNER OF IRAN  -------------------------------     DUBAI 00000235  002.2 OF 003   5.  (SBU) Despite the 2006 FIFA suspension, Ahmadinejad's personal involvement in Team Melli has only grown in significance.  In June 2008, Ahmadinejad, with the assistance of Seyyed Hasan Khomeini, Ayatollah Khomeini's grandson, successfully pressured the FFIRI to lift its suspension of star Ali Karimi in order for him to play in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.  According to press reports, Ahmadinejad was personally involved in the firing of coach Ali Daei after Iran's loss to Saudi Arabia in March 2009.  Team Melli's next coach, Mohammad Mayeli-Kohan, only lasted two weeks in the politically-charged environment.  With Ahmadinejad's support, Team Melli eventually settled on American citizen and former 1998 World Cup U.S. team assistant coach Afshin Ghotbi, who was greeted with a hero's welcome by Iranian fans at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport.  Ahmadinejad personally loaned Team Melli his presidential plane to travel to Pyongyang for Ghotbi's debut match against North Korea on June 6.    6.  (C) Because of the government's strong influence - IRPO's contact claims  that Iranian intelligence services have files on most prominent soccer figures -  Team Melli's players, most of whom were born after the Revolution, have ambitions to play in the West and privately support Reformists, but are careful not to cross political redlines.  However, the heightened intensity of this year's campaign season has inspired a number of prominent soccer officials, including the managing board of Zob Ahan Football Club and the former coach of Persepolis Football Club, to endorse Mir-Hossein Mousavi.  Soccer fans, too, have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Ahmadinejad administration.  The same contact told IRPO that the crowd turned on Ahmadinejad's deputies, Vice President for Executive Affairs Ali Saeedlou and Vice President for Physical Education Mohammad Ali Abadi, after  Persepolis, the most popular and successful of Iran's government-owned clubs,  lost to Uzbekistan's Bunyodkor Football Club in last week's AFC Champions League match.  Iranian fans reportedly cheered "we don't want political soccer" and began to pelt the two administration officials, before security arrived to escort them out of the stadium.    7.  (C) Despite Ahmadinejad's support, Iran's chances of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup are slim.  Following last week's disappointing 0-0 draw against North Korea, Team Melli will play the UAE in Tehran on June 10,  two days before the presidential election.  Although the UAE is widely recognized as the worst team in Iran's qualifying group, Team Melli tied UAE 1-1 when they last met in November 2008.  A loss to the UAE, Iran's political and economic rival across the Strait of Hormuz, would be deeply embarrassing to Iranian national pride and could very well damage Ahmadinejad's image in the mind of the Iranian electorate.  According to contacts, Ahmadinejad "cannot afford" a loss on the eve of the election in such a tight race.  Some in Iran doubt that Ahmadinejad will even make an appearance at the UAE match after he was deemed a "jinx" by superstitious fans, who linked his arrival at Azadi Stadium for Iran's last home match against Saudi Arabia with the downturn in the game. However, Ahmadinejad has given no indication that he plans to disassociate himself from Team Melli on the verge of elimination.  "Unfortunately, this sport has been afflicted with some very bad issues," he told Iranian media on June 7.  "I must intervene personally to push aside these destructive issues."    COMMENT  -------    8.  (C) Through his decidedly public involvement with Team Melli, Ahmadinejad has inextricably linked himself to the outcome of Iran's bid to qualify for the 2010 World Cup.  The presidential election, which has become hotly contested over recent days as Ahmadinejad has cast aspersions on his rivals and drawn other powerful elites into the fray by making  sweeping allegations of corruption, is increasingly turning into a referendum on Ahmadinejad himself.  Though many serious issues will draw Iranians to the polls on June 12, one cannot overlook the effect that the result of the June 10 Iran-UAE match, especially an embarrassing loss, could have on Ahmadinejad's electoral fortunes.  To many, the state of soccer in Iran today  DUBAI 00000235  003.2 OF 003   reflects the problems that Ahmadinejad's challengers claim the country has suffered under his administration.   Whereas Iran achieved international prominence in the 1998 World Cup under Khatami, Ahmadinejad's politicization of the sport has compromised Team Melli's standing on the world stage, and in many Iranians' eyes, further jeopardized the country's national pride.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Conversations with Iranian businessmen and financial consultants held in the past week reveal an overwhelming preference among our contacts for Mohsen Rezai's economic proposals, but most intend to vote for Mir Hossein Mousavi for political and social reasons. Our contacts admit that these non-economic issues may be more important to them than the poorer or rural voters and note that the majority of Iranians are less interested in the battle over economic statistics and macro performance of the country and more focused on their day-to-day situations. In general there are very low expectations for any meaningful economic reform, but our interlocutors hope that the election's focus on the economy will cultivate a better environment for pursuing solutions after the election.  End Summary.    2. (C) In perhaps a fitting end to the candidates' debates, the final match-up between former IRGC head Mohsen Rezai and President Ahmadinejad focused almost exclusively on the economy, which arguably is one of the key factors in this election. Iranians we have spoken to all agree that the economy is crucial. They note that Ahmadinejad's promise to put oil money on people's tables really resonated with Iranians in 2005, and any similar populist messages this time around will be attractive. For all the time candidates spent arguing over statistics and macroeconomic policy, however, our contacts did not think that rural and less educated Iranians cared very much about data on growth, investment, and production. Rather, Iranians' concerns over their day-to-day finances would determine their vote.    3. (C) A businessman in the oil and gas industry told us that Ahmadinejad's support among the rural population -- built on those promises of distribution of oil revenues -- may be weakening because of unmet expectations.  He cited incomplete projects in some provinces, broken promises of Ahmadinejad's provincial visits, and the poor results of the government's housing loan program in some villages. These particular loans were intended to allow rural Iranians to construct new homes, contingent on their use of steel, concrete, and brick as earthquake protection measures. Some Iranians, however, were only able to complete parts of their home because of the rising cost of cement, steel, and brick, and the simple insufficiency of the USD 5,000 loans. He wonders if recipients question the benefit of these low-cost loans if they were not enough to do what was promised.    4. (C) Our contacts, ranging from financial consultants to providers of industrial equipment, have echoed the key critiques thrown at Ahmadinejad by his opponents. When asked if these reproaches are accurate, exaggerated, or mask a deeper grievance, they responded that the problems are real, but they also note that Ahmadinejad in some cases has only aggravated much deeper structural problems for which previous governments must also be held responsible.  Despite our contacts' consensus on Ahmadinejad's failures and the claims of his opponents, they hold decidedly different opinions about the candidates' economic plans.    Candidates' Economic Advisors Important Symbols for Electorate  --------------------------------------------- -------------------    5. (C) Most Iranians we talked to did not see much difference between the three challengers.  Our contacts maintained that there is little difference between the economic platforms of Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi.  One of the key questions plaguing Mousavi, however, has been how sincerely he has embraced economic reforms.  Despite Mousavi's claims of supporting the private sector and foreign investment, one Iranian businessman labeled him a "pure socialist." He was very leftist as prime minister, and Iranians are unsure whether to believe his excuse that his nationalization of industries was required by the war situation at the time.  He has, however, assembled a team of reform-minded economic advisors --specifically well-known economist Farshad Momeni and the former secretary of the Tehran bourse Hossein Abdeh-Tabrizi -- that suggests his views have evolved since the 1980s.  DUBAI 00000244  002.2 OF 003      6. (C) Karroubi has made various pledges that lead many commentators to consider him as much an economic populist as Ahmadinejad, including one to give USD 70 per month to every Iranian. Nevertheless, most contacts described Karroubi as more free-market than Mousavi.  More than one contact dismissed Karroubi's populist campaign tactics as only an election maneuver to capture voters who may be swayed by Ahmadinejad's stipends.  Like Mousavi, he has a very strong economic team, including former economic minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari and former Tehran mayor, and "excellent manager", and Karroubi's choice for first vice president Gholam-Hossein Karbaschi.    7. (C) Among our contacts, there is unanimous agreement that Rezai's plan for the economy is the most fundamentally sound. Iranians we talk to here say that expanding the private sector and investing in capital projects is exactly what Iran needs. They emphasize that Rezai's focus on the economy comes from his powerful position as Secretary of the Expediency Council, a platform from which he has used in the past to speak out against Ahmadinejad and his short-term, populist policy and in favor of long-term, investment-centered policy.  An Iranian financial consultant said that Rezai is the only candidate who talked about freedom of the economy and deregulation and came across as very professional and polished in his debates.    Candidates' Plans Unlikely to Take Shape After Election  --------------------------------------------- ----------    8. (C) Although the economy has dominated much of the candidates' debates, has stirred much discussion in the press and will heavily influence the outcome the election, our contacts in Dubai doubt meaningful economic reforms will be possible. Two businessmen did not think candidates' economic promises resonated much with the private sector because Iran's entrenched economic elite-Rafsanjani and the Revolutionary Guard Corps for example-will see to it that their own interests are not threatened by thwarting any initiative to undercut them.    9. (C) Likewise, our contacts said some of the promises candidates are making are impractical or not fully thought through.  Karroubi's plan's pledge to give every Iranian USD 70 will be nearly impossible to implement given the decline in many of Iran's economic indicators-notably GDP growth, unemployment, oil prices, and a looming budget deficit.  Mousavi's supporters here note that it is laudable for him to talk about boosting the private sector, but he has not mentioned liberalizing the economy, without which the private sector will not flourish. For Rezai's part, although he gets the most points from Iranians concerned with the economy here, they do not see him as a viable candidate because of the lack of trust Iranians have in him. One contact said Rezai "is only talking about the economy because he does not believe in political freedoms." Iran's private sector, 80 economists, and the administration of the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad have published letters and editorials suggesting they do not believe any of the candidates have presented economic solutions.    Comment  --------    10. (C) For many Iranians, this election has come down to a question of which candidate will do most to make life better, and the candidates, including Ahmadinejad, have been promoting the economic merits of their platforms heavily, as was seen during the one-on-one debates.  For most voters, the economy and the possible betterment of their own financial situation will be the basis of their decision for whom to vote.  But the economy should not be seen as the single defining issue of this election.  Our contacts, most of whom are highly educated, financially better off, and business savvy, believe Rezai is the  DUBAI 00000244  003.2 OF 003   most qualified candidate to undertake meaningful economic reform, but many of them will vote for Mousavi because they consider political and personal freedoms as important to Iran's future as reforming its economy.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Summary: The overwhelming last-minute mobilization of the urban vote will likely lead to President Ahmadinejad's defeat, as many Iranians who typically stay home on election day now view Friday's election as a rare chance to exert some influence over the direction of their country.  IRPO contacts and a growing body of analysis now predict that even if Mousavi cannot take the election in the first round on June 12, he will almost certainly defeat Ahmadinejad in a two-man race a week later.  Ahmadinejad retains support in the provinces and key institutions such as the Basij, but his ability to manipulate the vote will likely be constrained by high voter turnout and the advocacy of senior establishment power-brokers determined to prevent Ahmadinejad's re-election. Rafsanjani's "warning" to the Supreme Leader that an Ahmadinejad victory could undermine the Islamic Republic itself, while undoubtedly self-serving, is also likely true.  Ahmadinejad, a polarizing figure within Iran long before this heated campaign season, has become a virtual lightning rod.  Neither his supporters nor his many opponents will take defeat at the polls well. End summary.    Mousavi Surges Ahead    2. (S/NF) There is growing consensus among Iranian political analysts and IRPO contacts that Mir Hossein Mousavi will win Iran's tenth presidential election on June 12, either in the first round or after a run-off with President Ahmadinejad on June 19.  Though Ahmadinejad retains his core support in the provinces, the shift in conventional wisdom follows a week of voter mobilization in Tehran and other cities, overwhelmingly in favor of Mousavi. Many IRPO contacts are invoking the 1979 Islamic Revolution to describe the level of excitement and engagement of Iranian society this week, and most of our interlocutors are now predicting participation levels of 70 or even 80 percent, similar to the turnout that swept Khatami into office in 1997.    3. (S/NF) Two other candidates, the reformist Mehdi Karroubi and the conservative Mohsen Rezai, remain in the race; Karroubi is expected to draw votes from both Mousavi and Ahmadinejad while Rezai, a co-founder of the Revolutionary Guards, will primarily take Ahmadinejad voters.  In the event of a run-off between the top two candidates, Mousavi will likely benefit from growing disenchantment with Ahmadinejad following a polarizing campaign period.    The Fraud Factor    4. (S/NF) The level of fraud remains a key factor in determining the outcome of the race; however, there are signs that Ahmadinejad's ability to cheat may have been eroded over recent days. In particular, the predicted large turnout will be a significant check against the effects of fraud.  In addition, it is clear that there will be intense scrutiny of the process, both by Ahmadinejad's electoral opponents as well as by the senior establishment figures he publicly branded as corrupt during the now-famous televised debate with Mousavi and subsequent campaign events.    5. (S/NF) Public awareness of the potential for fraud is also very high: a leading chant by Mousavi supporters captures the sentiment: "if there is no cheating, Mousavi will be president; if there is cheating, there will be a riot." (Note: It rhymes in Farsi.) A letter from Ministry of Interior employees alleging that radical Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi explicitly sanctioned changing votes in favor of Ahmadinejad and outlining the potential ways in which the Ahmadinejad campaign could cheat has circulated widely among Iranians.    6. (S/NF) Similarly, Rafsanjani's open letter to the Supreme Leader asking him to take "effective measures" to counter Ahmadinejad's "lies" or risk losing the "system's credibility  DUBAI 00000245  002.2 OF 002   and the sympathy of the people" has run in numerous media outlets inside Iran.  The letter was followed by news reports today of a three-hour meeting between Khamenei and Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani is quoted as describing the encounter as "one of my most productive meetings with the Leader of the Islamic Revolution," an indication he believes Khamenei has taken on board the potential consequences of an overtly fraudulent win by Ahmadinejad.  Earlier today the Mousavi camp also leaked a letter from the candidate to Khamenei in which he referenced "reports indicating that a number of Guards and Basij have been interfering in the election" and noting the "concerns of the people" about such activities.    Either Likely Scenario Could Spark Unrest    7. (S/NF) Similar to the campaign period itself, which has been punctuated by personal attacks and the massive mobilization of voters across Iran's fractured society, the outcome of the election is likely to be polarizing.  Either of the probable outcomes - a Mousavi win in the first or second round, or the re-election of Ahmadinejad tainted by the perception of fraud - will, at a minimum, spark a struggle over verification of the results.  There are signs that both camps are setting the scene to contest the results, with Ahmadinejad supporters also alleging malfeasance by his opponents' camps and laying down unrealistically high bench marks of the number of votes Ahmadinejad should in a fair contest.  Social unrest is also possible given the conviction among large swaths of society now that Ahmadinejad can not win fairly; conversely, Ahmadinejad has portrayed himself as a champion of disenfranchised Iranians and a potential martyr at the hands of a corrupt establishment.  His supporters are not likely to take defeat well.    8. (S/NF) Comment:  Though strong anecdotal evidence supports an eventual Mousavi win, the depth of Ahmadinejad's reservoir of support among rural and working class voters, as well as the role of the Revolutionary Guards, remain open questions. Supreme Leader Khamenei will no doubt play a key role in determining the transparency of this election and managing the political fall-out once the results are in.  The importance he and other leaders attach to the credibility of this election - which they view as an endorsement of the system by the people - likely trumps his personal preference for a particular candidate.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)  1. (S/NF) In reftel, we suggested the two most likely outcomes for the Iranian election were a Moussavi win in the first round, or a massively fraudulent Ahmadinejad win in the first round. (Winning in the first round requites winning more than 50 percent of the nationwide vote.) It appears both took place. Moussavi in a press conference on 06/13 claimed Interior Ministry told him and his campaign Friday night that he had won. It then appears that massive political intervention led to a huge (60 percent plus) AN landslide being announced on state TV early on Saturday.  2. (S/NF) Based upon statements by Moussavi and Karroubi, comments from sources inside Iran, and press reports, we can expect some form of public rejection by their campaigns and their supporters of the reelection of President Ahmadinejad. Former IRGC Commander Mohsen Rezai has not yet spoken on the results. In his statements Moussavi called the result "treason" and vowed to fight. Karroubi issued a statement at 1500 Tehran time on 06/13 calling the process unconstitutional and stating that he would not remain quiet as he did in 2005.  3. (S/NF) Official results of AN's victory with 63 percent of the vote were announced at 1630 Tehran time Saturday. Even before the results were public, large protests have reportedly broken out in Tehran as of 1530. We anticipate these will continue, possibly leading to skirmishes between Moussavi supporters and AN forces this evening. Reports indicate a heavy security presence in the Tehran streets, so the situation could escalate quickly.  4. (S/NF) Comment: We surmise that the Supreme Leader's control over the security services and national media will act to inhibit the flow of reliable information coming out of Iran in the coming days. As reported earlier, however, over 200 foreign media were in Iran to cover the election, so they may serve as an eyewitness to developments. The outcome of this contested election could be as limited as a large segment of the population feeling intensely alienated and angry. This is nothing new for the IRIG, and their monopoly of force and some well-timed repression can likely quell most dissent - although it would be particularly bad PR to do this while so many foreign media are present.  5. (S/NF) Comment, Cont'd.: It is possible, however, that given the number of senior political figures this campaign and this election result have profoundly angered, and the scope of popular resentment over the results; a large-scale political crisis could develop. Our position should remain wait-and-see for the time being, particularly as several key figures have yet to speak publicly on events. That said, if the opposition does start to organize on a large scale, or if clashes turn violent, we will need to quickly determine an appropriate public position. Many opposition supporters will likely look to the US - particularly after the Cairo speech - for inspiration.  ASGARD

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Iran analysts, both Iranian and foreign, have reacted with incredulity to the results of the Iranian presidential election and accused the IRIG of grossly rigging the election and falsifying the resuls.  The Iran Regional Presence Office's review of Iran's recent presidential elections and the current election indicate the accusations of fraud have merit. Key points:    -- The numbers released by the Ministry of Interior - for all four of the candidates - contravene known voting patterns in Iran's recent history.  Most significantly, accepting the Ministry of Interior's numbers requires believing that a massive new group of voters who did not support Ahmadinejad in 2005 voted in favor of him this time.    -- Media supportive of Ahmadinejad began indicating he had won before polls closed and before counting was to have begun.  Just after 6pm in Iran, an article appeared on the Fars news website in Farsi alleging that a candidate had won the election with about 60% of the vote, nearly matching the final outcome.    -- There is strong evidence that the government had prepared extensively for the post-election riots despite that past elections have not provoked riots.    Where does Ahmadinejad's Majority Come From?    2. (S/NF) According to the Ministry of Interior (MOI), 46.2 million of Iran's 70 million people were eligible to vote in the election. Based on the numbers released publicly by the MOI on June 13, turnout exceeded 85 percent nationwide, based on 38.95 million ballots cast.  This is the highest participation level recorded in a national election, topping the 80 percent turnout in the 1997 presidential election.  This level of voter participation was anticipated by most Iran political analysts and supported anecdotally through widespread foreign and domestic media coverage of long lines at polling stations in major urban centers throughout the day.    3. (S/NF) Khatami won the 1997 and 2001 elections in landslides, taking 70 percent and 78 percent, respectively.  He had broad support across all demographics, but the large margins of victory were primarily due to his ability to mobilize and sweep the urban vote.    4. (S/NF) During the eight years of Khatami's administration, urban voters grew disillusioned with the political system that prevented Khatami from effectively implementing the reform movement's platform and emerged as a largely silent majority within Iran.  Participation among this cadre dropped in the 2004 Majles election, the 2005 presidential election, and the 2008 Majles election.  It is within this context that the relatively-unknown Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005, primarily on the back of a strong rural turnout and a significant popular backlash to his principal opponent.  The 2007 Tehran City Council election provides a snapshot of Ahmadinejad's urban support, midway between the two presidential elections. Ahmadinejad's allies in the election fared poorly in the 2007 Tehran City Council election, indicating that two years into his tenure his urban support, at least in Tehran, remained low.    5. (S/NF) In the first round of the 2005 election, Ahmadinejad gained 20 percent of the vote, roughly 5.6 million people. This cohort should be considered his base of support at that time.  Ahmadinejad may have expanded his base in the intervening 4 years, and likely did, but the MOI numbers require that Ahmadinejad's base roughly quadrupled.  The MOI numbers show that 85 percent of the country voted and that Ahmadinejad received 63 percent of the vote, an outcome that requires Ahmadinejad to have captured a significant share of the urban  DUBAI 00000249  002.2 OF 003   vote and the silent majority - the exact people who stayed home in the past few elections rather than vote for Ahmadinejad or his political allies.    6. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad does enjoy a loyal, committed base of support.  He has been in campaign mode since 2005 but has focused his attention and the government's resources mainly on the rural voters who brought him to office.  He has also recently been able to boost the salaries of many public sector workers and pensioners.  In the months leading up to the election, however, there was a growing consensus among political scientists, sociologists, and economists that despite the handouts and salary increases, Ahmadinejad's support among the poor and the working class in both urban and rural areas was eroding rather than increasing.  It is well-established that attendance at Ahmadinejad public events is enhanced by cash handouts, and supporters are often bussed to events to ensure high turnout.    7. (S/NF) The election results released by the MOI contravene voting patterns in Iran's recent history.   In 2005, Ahmadinejad's support in the 30 provinces ranged from a low of 6 percent to a high of 55 percent, reflecting a range of voting preferences among Iran's diverse population.  In this election, Ahmadinejad's support ranged from a low of 45 percent to a high of 77 percent, and he received under 50 percent in only two provinces.  Also, Karroubi gained 18 percent of the vote in 2005 and swept his home province of Lorestan.  According to the MOI, this year he captured less than 1 percent of the vote nationwide and just 4 percent in Lorestan.  Of the three "Azerbaijani" provinces, Mousavi lost two to Ahmadinejad and barely won a third; historically, even minor presidential candidates with an Azerbaijani background win these provinces.  It is worth noting that Mousavi lost his home province, East Azerbaijan, despite his candidacy's significant resonance amongst his fellow Azeri Iranians.  Ahmadinejad won East Azerbaijan, despite having polled at only 15 percent there in 2005.    Government Oversight also Raises Suspicions    8. (S/NF) The process of counting and announcing results did not follow the government's own rules. In past elections, the government entities charged with administering and certifying results have largely observed the protocol outlined in the Election Law. The Ministry of Interior usually announces provincial and municipal results real time, as they are counted, following the close of the polls.  Such results were only announced three days later in this election. Khamenei, rather than waiting  for the Guardians Council to certify the election before endorsing the result, approved of the results prior to the MOI's announcement of the final results.    9. (S/NF) Media supportive of Ahmadinejad began indicating he had won before polls closed and before counting was to have begun. Just after 6pm in Iran, an article appeared on the Fars news website in Farsi alleging that a candidate had won the election with about 60 percent of the vote.    10. (S/NF) There is strong evidence that the government had prepared extensively for the post-election riots, with the pre-positioning of anti-riot units, the cuts in SMS service before the election, and the denial of communication services to reformist groups.  However, past elections have not provoked riots.  The riots in protest of the announcement of election results are occurring in all major cities, and across a variety of neighborhoods within the cities.  Protests have not been limited to specific demographic groups.    Comment:     DUBAI 00000249  003.2 OF 003   11. (S/NF) The actual results of the election will likely never be known.  However, IRPO concludes that the allegations of widespread fraud have merit. ASGARD

They consider the demonstration coinciding with Supreme Leader Khamenei's Friday Prayers to be the most important rally yet because the demonstrators will have the opportunity show Khamenei the scale of the support for Mir Hossein Mousavi. The group thinks Khamenei receives limited information from his handlers.  They also maintain that it is possible, even likely, for Khamenei to abandon Ahmadinejad in order to defuse the crisis.  They think the demonstrators are targeting Ahmadinejad and not Khamenei, suggesting that the demonstrators are not as revolutionary as some media reports portray. They do not expect Mousavi to compromise, which points to a more protracted affair if their sense of Khamenei is wrong.    2. (S/NF) The four professors and one PhD student of philosophy and religion are from throughout Iran; two professors are from universities in Qom, one was from Mashhad, and another from Tehran.  The student was also from Tehran.  All spoke freely about the election and its aftermath.  They all seemed to be Mousavi supporters and the PhD student had attended one of his demonstrations.  They arrived in Dubai yesterday, June 17. End Summary.    Friday's Prayers a Critical Opportunity to Enlighten Khamenei    3. (S/NF) In Tehran, the academics believe that the protests are still gathering momentum and that the Friday demonstration to coincide with Khamenei's delivery of the Friday Prayers is the most important yet.  They maintained Khamenei receives little information from his handlers and does not appreciate the scale of the support for Mousavi. (Note: Other IRPO contacts have also suggested that Khamenei is not fully aware of Mousavi's support.) They consider the opportunity for Mousavi's partisans to turn out en masse and show their support for Mousavi to be critical in convincing Khamenei to reverse course.    4. (S/NF) The academics said protests are occurring throughout the country in larger urban areas.  The IRIG can more easily control smaller cities and towns and, as such, there have not been many protests there. Qom has been relatively quieter; one of the Qom professors said the youth in Qom tend to support Ahmadinejad but whereas those older support Mousavi.  When asked about the alleged strike to have taken place earlier this week, they appeared confused.  One responded that Mousavi had not officially called for a strike and was not likely to do so because the Mousavi camp is advocating calmer, peaceful forms are resistance.    5. (S/NF) Word of mouth remains the demonstrators most effective means of communication.  Of course, they said, Facebook and the internet are important, but telephones are working and people are talking.  Paper messages, noting demonstrations, are also important.    Khamenei to Blink First?    6. (S/NF) The professors think the resolution of the situation will depend on the nature of Khamenei's compromise. They still consider it possible, even likely, for Khamenei to abandon Ahmadinejad.  When asked who the protests are targeting, they responded that replacing Ahmadinejad remains the goal. Ahmadinejad, they said, has a degree of support among the religiously devout and the lower classes, but were Khamenei to withdraw his support, so too would many of the President's backers.    7. (S/NF) They do not anticipate, however, that Mousavi will compromise.  They consider Mousavi to be a much stronger figure  DUBAI 00000255  002.2 OF 002   than former President Khatami and noted that during the 1980s, Mousavi was able to get the best of Khamenei.  They now maintain that Mousavi is becoming very powerful.    8. (S/NF) None of the academics had heard or seen anything of Rafsanjani, though all assumed he was heavily involved behind the scenes.  One of the professors described Rafsanjani as the only person who could control the movement.  They also noted that Ahmadinejad's presidency was the result of the feud between Rafsanjani and Khamenei.  The academics did not place much significance on the role of the clerics.  They said even though most clerics were opposed to Ahmadinejad, they were also conservative, and beyond encouraging people to vote, were unlikely to intervene further in political matters.  The academics also downplayed the rumored Assembly of Experts meeting, suggesting that there would not be an official meeting.    Applause for President Obama's Comments    9. (S/NF) All said that President Obama had struck the right balance in his comments on the protests and agree that the USG should allow Iranians to sort out the problem for themselves. They did not recommend changing course.  At the same, they support USG condemnation of violence against demonstrators. (Note: They mentioned having heard that Voice of America was encouraging Iranians to take part in the evening roof-top chants of "Allah-u Akbar. ")    Comment:    10. (S/NF) The movement described by the academics seems less radical and less revolutionary than some accounts in the media portray the situation.  If focusing on Ahmadinejad and not Khamenei, the demonstrators do not appear to seek the downfall of the Islamic Republic.  The academics' sense that Mousavi did not call for a strike in the bazaars and is unlikely to do so also supports this notion.  If true, this would give Khamenei more maneuvering room to defuse the situation. Khamenei could compromise without fatally wounding his own standing.  Still, their sense that Khamenei is not an active player in the unfolding drama and is being misled by his handlers seems a touch naove and is clearly not shared by all involved.  The Supreme Leader's rivals, Rafsanjani chief among them, are also more likely to see any compromise as a sign of weakness, as is the Supreme Leader. That, coupled with the academics faith in Mousavi's fortitude, points to a more protracted affair.  End comment. MCGOWAN

McGowan, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF)  Participant in Saturday Demonstration Describes Security Forces: A long-standing IRPO contact who splits his time between Tehran and Dubai described witnessing at least four different groups of security forces on the streets of Tehran during the demonstrations Saturday that were violently broken up by IRIG security forces.  He could not precisely identify the affiliation of each group, but distinguished the groups from each other by uniform, equipment, and behavior toward the demonstrators.    -The most intimidating force, in his opinion, was the group he alternately termed "nirooha-ye entezami" or  "yeghaan-e vijeh" in Farsi.  He said members of this group were dressed either in all black or in dark green camouflage and had protective padding on their uniforms.  He noted that these force were the most heavily armed of the various forces on the street.  They carried stun guns, pellet guns and special riot gear, including full coverage helmets.  He said the men in dark green camouflage were responsible for most of the arrests he witnessed, particularly once groups of protestors were herded toward Azadi Square.  He said they rode in pairs on motorcycles and often drove through the center of groups of demonstrators to force them to separate from one another.  He described watching these forces use stun guns to take down demonstrators in order to then bind their hands together and put them into black vans.  He did not witness the men in all black uniforms engaging the demonstrators, but described watching them encircle groups of protestors and take photographs and videos of them.    -Our contact said he had not previously seen the second group, who wore "new-looking" uniforms of light brown camouflage and had "modern" equipment.  Their vehicles identified them as belonging to "niroo-ye vijeh velayat, " or "ruler's special forces" (NFI).   He said this group was not particularly aggressive and that their main purpose seemed to be deterrence: they were lined up in rows to prevent entry into Enghelab Square.  He also witnessed members of this force arresting people for throwing rocks at shop windows.    -He believed members of the third group, who were wearing dark greens uniforms, belonged to the IRGC.  He said they had a heavy presence in both Azadi Square and Enghelab Square but seemed primarily interested in crowd control rather than dispersing groups of demonstrators.    -He said that the fourth group, the Basijis, outnumbered the uniformed security forces by "ten to one. "  While in civilian attire, he said Basij members are identifiable by their untucked shirts and were typically armed with clubs and batons.  Some of them were equipped with helmets as well.    -Our contacted noted that unlike the relatively peaceful demonstrations during the week leading up to Ayatollah Khamenei's Friday sermon, the regular police were nowhere to be seen on Saturday.    2. (S) Former Majles Member Comments on Unrest:  A member of the 6th and 7th Majles seeking a visa in Dubai views a new election as the only solution to the unrest in Iran.  He conceded that such a step was unlikely, however, and does not anticipate Khamenei or Mousavi to compromise.  He expects the crisis to drag on and noted that the current situation is unpredictable. At the same time, he said that whereas the government forces have weapons and resources, the demonstrators do not. Commenting on the security forces, he believes the majority of the IRGC is supportive of Khamenei but that the LEF is probably torn between their loyalty to the government and their desire to avoid harming their fellow Iranians, but he was unable to provide examples to substantiate either observation.  Regarding the bazaar, he observed that some shops have been closed but others, having been pressured by the government to remain open, are hesitant to close.  Comment:  The former Majles member was openly supportive of Mousavi but his comments did not seem  DUBAI 00000258  002.2 OF 002   particularly biased.  Still, his views appear to be based on his general sense of things; he had few specifics or details to substantiate his assessments.    3. [C] Professor Challenges Notion of Broad Rural Support for Ahmadinejad:  A professor from Yasouj University, located in Kohgiluyeh va Buyer Ahmad (KBA) province in southwestern Iran, said he was shocked at Ahmadinejad's landslide victory.  He claimed to have spoken to many folks from all levels of society before the election and Mousavi had much support.  Ahmadinejad did have supporters in small villages, which the professor attributed to government control over the media and the financial benefits Ahmadinejad had provided, but he still claimed to have met many Mousavi backers in the same such villages.  Despite frustration with the outcome, he said there had not been protests because it's a small city and everyone knows each other.  Comment: According to the Ministry of Interior's election results, Ahmadinejad won KBA province with nearly 70 percent of the vote and Mousavi was second with 27 percent.  The professor said he was a Mousavi supporter.    4. [C] Khamenei's Friday Prayers a Turning Point for Some:  A young Tehrani in Dubai for a visa offered a less dramatic account of the situation, claiming Tehran "is not that bad, " at least not as bad as the Western media is portraying it.  Aside from a few pockets, things were normal; he was continuing to go to work and live his life. He had participated in the peaceful demonstrations last week but had stopped following the Supreme Leader's Friday Prayer sermons.  He said he expects a compromise to end the standoff. Comment: This applicant's comments bode poorly for the prospects of the opposition's challenge to the status quo in Iran.  He did not seem particularly aggrieved by the election result, was persuaded by Khamenei to stop protesting, and generally expected a positive outcome but was no longer participating himself in the demonstrations. Anecdotal information suggests that many of the protestors are far more committed to their cause-and other contacts in Dubai are far angrier-but whether the majority will stand and fight or simply move on is an open question.    5. [C] Unrest Shaking Business Confidence; Strike Deemed Unlikely in the Near Term:  Iranian businessmen who have traveled from Iran to Dubai this week described the recent unrest as "painful, but manageable. " While there is no credible measure yet of the economic impact of the election's aftermath, the Tehran Stock Exchange has fallen steeply, both in value and volume of trade, indicating that investor confidence is shaken. One business contact said that the working mood in Tehran is "grim" and described how he has temporarily closed his factory out of concern for the security of his employees. He said he is still filling orders but warning of possible disruptions in deliveries.  He also stated that he is holding onto cash given the climate of uncertainty.  IRPO contacts tell us that as of June 22 there were no indications of hoarding of goods or disruptions to government services in Tehran.  Most retail stores, distribution networks, gas stations, and the postal service in Tehran appear to be operating as normal. MCGOWAN 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000261  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  6/24/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: UNREST RATTLES BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, BUT OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT LIMITED  DUBAI 00000261  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Kathleen A. McGowan, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) This message was coordinated with Iran Watcher at Embassy Baku    1. (C) Summary: Other than the Tehran Stock Exchange's steep decline, the initial impact of the post-electoral unrest on the economy appears to be more psychological than real.  Iran's oil production remains steady and major business centers open. Despite repeated rumors that the Mousavi-led opposition has called for a general strike, major work stoppages have not yet materialized although some small shops and businesses have reportedly closed temporarily.  IRPO contacts cite government intimidation and the failure of the opposition leadership to issue clear-cut calls for a strike as the primary reasons the strikes have not gained traction.  Still, our contacts note that a broad strike by a large swathe of the population across different sectors and regions is the opposition's best "trump card."   Work stoppages in the petroleum sector would have the most immediate impact, our contacts say, and would shake the regime's confidence that it can ride out the wave of green.  End summary.    Strikes Gaining Little Traction So Far    2. (S) The potency of a strike as a political pressure tactic is not lost among the opposition's supporters or detractors, but there has been little indication to date that such a move could gain sufficient momentum to weaken the government's resolve to resist compromising over the results of the election.  Iranian contacts of Watchers in Dubai and Baku who have shuttled back and forth in the past two weeks and foreign embassy personnel have reported few indigenous economic disturbances.  Iran Watcher Baku contacts indicated that the major oil and gas sites, the Abadan, Tabriz, Esfahan, Kermanshah refineries, and all the pipeline areas appeared to be operating normally, albeit under heavier security than usual, during the period of greatest unrest in the cities.  The status of bazaars throughout the country is less clear, but contacts say they have remained open for the most part. In particular, according to contacts of the Baku Watcher, the bazaar in Tabriz was open from last Thursday through Sunday, but reportedly closed early on Monday. Orumiyeh's was closed, but may now be open. Tehran's traditional bazaar has been open but closing before dusk, according to Dubai and Baku contacts and foreign diplomats posted in Tehran. Sporadic accounts from businessmen in Esfahan indicate that the main bazaar has remained open since the election, despite reports of violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces since the June 12 election.    3. (S) Our contacts do not believe that  a large scale general strike will occur soon, and speculate that only highly provocative moves by the government would instigate a widespread strike. Many have noted that whether people will respond to a general strike, especially in the oil sector, will depend on the state of protests at the time the strike is called and who is perceived as calling for it. Baku sources contend that a clear call from Mousavi/Karroubi that is able to be disseminated will have maximum impact. However an Iranian business consultant in Dubai observed that most families' financial situations in Iran today are precarious and that many people do not have the savings to willingly forego their income for a sustained period.   The consultant also noted that although some people he knows did not go to work last week out of solidarity with the demonstrators, many others likely fear government retribution. The Iran Watcher in Baku notes that his contacts in the energy sector are not certain that overwhelming numbers of petroleum workers would heed calls for general strike.  Iranian energy businessmen in Tehran and other cities told Baku Watcher that the strike option has been suspended as a last line of defense move.  All indicated that there was talk of closing bazaars earlier this week, but that Mir Hossein-Mousavi has asked the bazaaris to hold back until he gives the word.   Iranian professors from Mashhad, Qom, and Tehran and an industrialist in the oil sector earlier this week suggested that a massive strike was unlikely because it would undermine what they view as the peaceful tone of the reformists' campaign.     DUBAI 00000261  002.2 OF 002   4. (C) Sporadic internet reports of industrial work stoppages are difficult to confirm.  An Iranian blog claimed that Iran Khodro workers stopped work on June 18 out of solidarity with people in the streets, but our contacts were unaware of the effort, indicating it did not get much attention.  The Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Vahed Bus Company plan to use June 26, previously "Justice for Iranian workers day," to call on the government to protect civil rights and condemn violence and oppression in light of the recent crackdown.    Private Sector Rattled, but Likely Resilient    5. (C) Steep declines and the continuing volatility of the Tehran's Stock Exchange (TSE) suggest that unrest ignited by the election has shaken investor confidence inside Iran. The TSE fell 116 points between June 14 and 22 before regaining 88 points on June 23.  Although state domination of the bourse prevents it from being a true equities exchange, business contacts note it is a good measure of the business community's confidence in the economy.  On June 22 the head of the TSE announced pending legislation that would offer significant tax exemption to shareholders who decrease their turnover of shares. This is likely an incentive to people to leave their money in the market.    6. (S) One factory owner from Tehran said that he has had a hard time getting his products through customs and is warning customers that he accepts no responsibility for any delivery disruptions, although he has not yet experienced any. Two other small business owners noted that the business climate has been grim since the election.  Yet our business contacts also remind us that Iran's economy in general, and the relatively small private sector in particular, have survived many past crises.    Oil Sector Safe for Now    7. (U)  By all accounts, Iran's oil sector remains stable. Iran exports approximately 2.4. million barrels of oil per day, and its oil and gas sites-which are distant from major urban centers-have maintained normal production, according to market data. A Dubai contact recently in Iran noted that he did not observe any unusual activity or talk of shortages at the gas stations in Tehran. StatoilHydro-a Norwegian company active in Iran's lucrative South Pars Gas Field-shut its Tehran office on 16 June because of nearby street protests, and as of 18 June was giving its Norwegian workers and families the choice to leave, according to Western press. StatoilHydro and Schlumberger spokespersons on 18 June however said that business is operating as usual.    Economic Red Lines for the Regime    8. (S)  Comment:  Significant economic pressures would almost certainly worry the regime. A large bazaar strike similar  to the closure in protest of the VAT last October and those leading up to the Revolution would no doubt grab the regime's attention.  Historically, bazaar closures are the requisite first step to larger, more coordinated strikes backed by the financial clout of the business community. The strike last October, which originated in Esfahan, demonstrated that the close-knit relations essential for uniting the bazaar and engaging it in collective action still exist. Since the revolution however, the bazaar has engaged in political action only because of economic apprehension. It is unclear whether the opposition's political statement is resonating with the bazaar. A business contact in Dubai perceives a lack of cohesion within the bazaar but said that if there was broad participation throughout the country, many would be more likely to participate.   End comment. MCGOWAN

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Unconfirmed Detention of Dual National American Citizen in Iran:  An Iranian-American journalist (please protect) who was covering the presidential election for Tehran Bureau from inside Iran until his credentials were revoked several days ago said he personally witnessed the arrest of a dual U.S.-Iran national during a pro-Mousavi street rally several days before the election.  According to the journalist, who described the young man as a friend, he remains in detention despite the fact that the other demonstrators detained at the same time have since been freed.  However, it is unclear if the IRIG knows the detained individual is an American.  The young man's parents, who are in Iran, believe that publicizing his American citizenship would further imperil their son, given the government's recent attempts to portray the USG as an instigator of the post-election unrest.  Comment: The journalist disclosed this information, while refusing to divulge the full name of the person detained, during a conversation about the arrest of Greek journalist Iason Athanasiadis in Iran last week.  He argued that Athanasiadis' case was greatly complicated by the public disclosure that he is also a U.K. national.    2. (S) Ahmadinejad's Popularity Falling in the Arab World?: A Syrian journalist who owns a media consultancy firm in Dubai argued the post-election crisis in Iran has made Ahmadinejad vulnerable to criticism in the Arab street.  The journalist, a contact of ConGen Dubai's Regional Media Hub, believes the heated debates before the election made it clear to Arabs that this election was about Iran, not the U.S.  This distinction provided an unprecedented opportunity for Arab commentators to criticize Ahmadinejad without siding with the U.S.  The contact stressed, however, that Ahmadinejad has only lost standing among "moderate" Arabs; he believes that the majority of Arabs hold such strong opinions - whether for or against Ahmadinejad - that recent events have likely not swayed their positions one way or the other.  The journalist observed that, in the tradition of the Mahdi, many in the Arab street initially viewed Ahmadinejad as a "benevolent dictator. "  However, some moderate Arabs now realize that, despite his image in the Arab world as a humble man standing up to the West, Ahmadinejad is resented by many in Iran for mismanagement, incompetence, and corruption.  As a result of this very public fall from grace, he argued that Ahmadinejad is no longer the "untouchable, holy figure" in the Arab world he once was.    3. (C) NIOC Executives Reportedly Purged After Election: The purging of reformist-leaning activists and academics has moved to Iran's oil sector, according to an Iranian businessman with close contacts with managers at Iran's National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Many senior managers at NIOC have been forcibly "retired" since the election, supposedly because they were suspected of harboring sympathy with the opposition. This reported slate of dismissals comes amid the firing of Deputy Oil Minister for Planning Akbar Torkan - a Mousavi supporter - after he publicly questioned the government's oil sector policies in the run-up to the June 12 election. Our contact - who does not believe Mousavi would have won a fair election - speculated that the NIOC "house cleaning" was the government's reaction to widespread post-election rumors that the opposition would call for a strike in Iran's oil sector.  Comment: On June 1, Iran's state news agency carried a report quoting NIOC's Director General as saying that Torkan's ability to publicly criticize the Ahmadinejad government without fear of retribution proved that Ahmadinejad was tolerant of his critics.  Torkan's removal after the election suggests otherwise. The move also could be a continuation of attempts Ahmadinejad has made in recent years to go after Iran's "oil mafia," a term he frequently uses to refer to Rafsanjani's network in the sector.    4. (S) Iran National Soccer Team Players Quit Voluntarily:  A colleague of Team Melli captain Ali Karimi and coach Afshin Ghotbi, who was in Dubai to drop off Karimi's passport for a visa, denied rumors that the players who wore green wristbands during the June 17 match with South Korea have been forced off the team.  He said that the players faced limited professional opportunities in Iran, and therefore chose to retire in order to pursue opportunities with teams abroad.  According to the contact, the Iran Football Federation (IFF) has not taken any disciplinary action against the players, and they are all still in possession of their passports.  In fact, two of the players -  DUBAI 00000269  002.2 OF 003   Mehdi Mahdavikia and Vahid Hashemian - have already traveled to Europe without any incident.  However, he said he suspects the IFF may choose to quietly punish the players once tensions in Iran cool down.  He also alleged that the IFF asked FIFA to take disciplinary action against the Team Melli players, but FIFA refused the request because it violated rules against political interference.  According to the contact, Coach Afshin Ghotbi, an American citizen, is not in trouble and will likely continue to coach Team Melli.  Comment: This account contradicts media reports suggesting the players were forcibly retired, had their passports confiscated, and were banned from travel. Although it is clear that Ali Karimi's passport was not confiscated, we will not know if he is able to leave the country until he tries to travel to Los Angeles in the coming days.  These events do corroborate other reports IRPO has received about the politicization of soccer under Ahmadinejad.  Several contacts have told us that Team Melli is always accompanied abroad by government security officials; and it was reportedly a security minder who ordered the players to remove the wristbands at half-time.  Despite Ahmadinejad's best efforts to capitalize on Team Melli, participants in the recent demonstrations carried placards the words "Iran's champions" emblazoned over a photograph of the players wearing "Mousavi green. "    5. (S) Expediency Council Researcher Describes Drafting of 5-Year Development Plan:  A researcher in the Expediency Council's Center for Strategic Research (CSR) who was in Dubai to get a visa explained the CSR's role in drafting the 5-Year Development Plan. The researcher works in the agriculture section in the economics branch of the CSR; he and 16 other researchers/experts were responsible for drafting the "vision" for the development plan's parts related to agriculture.  The vision, he said, includes production, investment, and construction goals.  Their contribution, combined with the plans from other sections at the CSR, were then debated by the full Expediency Council and forwarded to the Supreme Leader for his approval.  The Ahmadinejad administration is now responsible for drafting the details of the plan and afterwards it will be sent to the Majles for approval.  The researcher discounted the notion that Ahmadinejad might balk at the Expediency Council's vision because the President had representatives in attendance during the Expediency Council's debate about the plan and he said the version approved by the Supreme Leader had everyone's support.  The agriculture section, and the CSR more generally, is also responsible for reviewing the government's performance relative to Development Plan benchmarks; these reports are also provided to the Supreme Leader.  He also described the structure of the CSR, explaining that the CSR has 5 branches focusing on the Economy, International Relations, New Technology such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, Energy, and Social Welfare. Within the Economic branch, which he knew more about, there are departments for Agriculture, Planning, Microeconomics, and Investment.  The agricultural department has recently been focusing on food security and irrigations projects.  Comment: The Expediency Council's role, per the constitution, is to arbitrate disputes between the Guardians Council and the Majles and provide guidance to the Supreme Leader.  The CSR's hand in formulating the development plan indicates that the EC proactively interprets its mandate to provide guidance and has broader involvement in formulating the government's strategic direction than the constitution implies.    6. (C) Visa Applicants Comment on Post-Election Unrest:  Iranian visa applicants in Dubai have generally expressed frustration with the outcome of the election.  Many student applicants, in particular, have complained about the results, and alleged cheating, but few have been active participants in the demonstrations against the regime.  Several students from Tehran University said that although they support the protesters, they do not want to participate in the demonstrations due to the risk of getting killed.  Comments:  The pool of visa applicants drawn to Dubai is largely made up of the westernized northern Tehran elite; a cohort that should theoretically be most aggrieved and offended at the outcome of the election.  The applicants in Dubai, however, have not been at the forefront of the demonstrations.  Even the students, between preparing for their final exams or coming to Dubai for their visa interviews, seem to have had other things to do and avoided the demonstrations. The collective sense from the applicants is one of resignation. Notable comments:   DUBAI 00000269  003.2 OF 003     - A visa applicant working for MTN Irancell, a quasi-government-owned mobile phone provider, said the company received an order from the government the day before the election instructing them to cut phone-based text messaging services on election day.  Per press reporting, the messaging service remains off.    - A student from Tabriz said that many people there are upset with the outcome of the election and that the city largely supported Mousavi in the election.  When asked why Tabriz has remained quieter than Tehran, he said the heavy presence of the riot police on the city's streets dissuaded many from joining protests.  The student, who is not Azeri himself, said that only Mousavi was capable of leading the opposition movement, but at the same time said the opposition is not about Mousavi himself, it's about seeking change and opening Iran to the West.    - A student from Tehran University said she had not participated in the demonstrations because she was busy preparing for and taking her end-of-year exams.  The student explained that the exams were not uniformly delayed but that each school's faculty decided whether to delay the exams.  Her department - she is an anthropology student - is not located near the areas of greater unrest, and as a result, provided students the option of delaying their exams or taking them on time.  She said some students delayed solely to participate in the demonstrations; others, like herself, took their exams on time.    - Another student from Tehran University said the protests and demonstrations were useful because they showed the world that Iranians are not all "terrorists."  However, he did not think the protests would force changes in the government any time soon. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The Guardians Council formally certified Ahmadinejad's landslide reelection on June 29, theoretically closing the door to any further challenges of the results. Nevertheless, the key opposition leadership figures categorically rejected the verdict and vowed publicly to fight on, outlining plans to form a commission to petition the judiciary to dismiss the results. Though Mousavi continues to exhort his supporters to demonstrate peacefully, he has not issued specific calls for mass civil disobedience that would challenge the state security forces' ability to maintain order. Rather, Mousavi and his allies appear to be focusing their efforts on attacking the legitimacy of a second Ahmadinejad government.  This psychological warfare is likely intended to further isolate Ahmadinejad's government, both at home and abroad, while continuing to exacerbate fissures within the clerical and political elite. A spate of public criticism of the election and the government's conduct by clerical figures, coupled with signs that known adversaries of Ahmadinejad within the government have maintained their stature within the system, indicate that though the streets are quiet for now, the power struggle at the top is far from over. End summary.    2.(C) Since the initial announcement of Ahmadinejad's landslide win, which Supreme Leaders Khamenei quickly endorsed in a statement issued the day after the election, the government has maintained that all complaints regarding the election must be channeled through the Guardians Council (GC).  With varying degrees of steadfastness, the three defeated candidates have rejected this process, arguing that the GC is not an impartial arbiter and can not credibly investigate complaints against the process.  Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi have gone so far as to publicly accuse the GC of having played a role in the fraud.    3. (C) Nevertheless, the GC pressed on, giving the government an ongoing "legal process" to deflect criticism and buy time. On June 29, however, this process ended as the GC certification of essentially the same results first announced by state media the day after the June 12 election.  According to Iran's Election Law, there are no other legal avenues available to the aggrieved candidates to pursue their complaints.    4. (C) The main opposition figures - Mousavi, Karroubi and former President Khatami - swiftly and categorically rejected the GC's verdict in near-simultaneous public statements deeming the election and the subsequent Ahmadinejad second term "illegitimate."  In a statement issued July 1, Mousavi deemed the election illegitimate, detailed government improprieties before, during and after the election, and made sweeping demands of the state, including the release of political prisoners and the end of the repression of civil society. The typically soft-spoken Khatami accused the government of committing a "velvet revolution against the people," while the print edition of Karroubi's newspaper was shut down after he opened a condemnation of the election with a Koranic verse implying the death of the Islamic Republic.  The three men have vowed to fight on and announced their intent to form a special committee to challenge the election in the judiciary. It is unclear, however, on what basis they can do or whether the judiciary would be any more open to hearing their complaints. (Note: Conservative media reported this week that Sadegh Larijani, brother of Majles speaker Ali Larijani, will soon replace Ayatollah Shahrudi as head of the judiciary.)    5. (C) Despite the fiery rhetoric and Mousavi's exhortations to his followers to continue to peacefully demonstrate, he has not issued a specific call for collective action on a scale that would disrupt everyday life in Iran.  With limited ability to communicate or organize, and in the face of the state's ability to effectively suppress or pre-empt significant demonstrations, the key opposition figures appear to have little ability to mobilize the masses.   Instead, they appear to be conducting psychological warfare against the government, specifically attacking the legitimacy of the next Ahmadinejad government, rather than fomenting mass civil disobedience.  While this approach may not inspire the public, by continuing to issue statements he does keep the issue alive at a popular level. That said, Mousavi seems to have shied away from a head on  DUBAI 00000273  002.2 OF 002   confrontation and his overarching aim is likely intended to exacerbate fissures within the governing elite and prevent the forces that have effectively vanquished the reformers from cementing their monopoly on political power.    6. (C) There has been much speculation about the machinations of Iran's clerical community in the aftermath of the election.  The tainted election prompted reports that Assembly of Experts Speaker Rafsanjani was attempting to marshal support in that body to challenge Khamenei's primacy in the country.  The ultimate results of Rafsanjani's efforts are unknown and his only public statement to date was a typically (and almost certainly intentionally) ambiguous statement.  In recent days there has been a slight uptick in public reports of senior clerics expressing their frustration, albeit obliquely, with the election's aftermath. For example, Grand Ayatollah Safi Golpayegani, former secretary of the GC, said that "We should have acted in a way that these issues would not have come up. We should have moderated our positions and opinions. "  And mid-ranking cleric (and son of a revered late Grand Ayatollah), Hojjat ol-Eslam Hadi Ghaffari, directly criticized Khamenei, a significant breach of Iran's red lines. Because the clergy are theoretically a pillar of the Islamic Republic, public dissent by respected clerical figures is more costly for the government than criticism emanating from secular political figures. However, the clerics were largely opposed to Ahmadinejad ahead of the election and their sentiments seem to have had little effect with Khamenei.    7. (C) Comment: Nearly three weeks after the election that sparked widespread popular unrest and exposed deep fissures within the ruling political and clerical elite, and between the government and the public, a political compromise that would satisfy the defeated candidates and their supporters remains improbable.  Mousavi and his allies have seemingly lost the ability use public pressure to force the government to change course and instead are trying to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the government among the political and clerical elite.  Their strategy risks further backlash from Khamenei and Ahmadinejad - elements within the government and conservative media continue to set the stage for Mousavi's defiance to be punished - and probably ensures that the highly polarized environment in Iran will continue.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Continuing Anger at Government, Growing Impatience with Mousavi:  IRPO contacts recently returned from Iran to Dubai describe widespread frustration among the general populace and noted a sharp escalation in the anti-government rhetoric during casual conversations.  The visible security presence on the streets of Tehran is significantly diminished, according to two businessmen who split their time between Dubai and Tehran. Whereas squads of uniformed security forces effectively occupied major squares and heavily patrolled key thoroughfares last week, this week their visibility has been scaled back.  The businessmen said security has "gone mobile" in the form of two-person teams on motorbikes.  From their office near Enghelab Square on Sunday they observed a team pass by about every ten minutes.  Though the nightly calls of Allahu Akbar continue, no effective alternative to the now-suppressed street demonstrations has surfaced.  These contacts say that many of their employees and associates, most of whom participated in the demonstrations, are growing disenchanted with the key opposition figures - Mousavi, Karrubi, and Khatami - for their failure to "do something," and some are openly saying that since nonviolence has failed, a revolution is required.  The two contacts felt that the Iftikar protest on Thursday would not gain much traction, both because the government was prepared for unrest and because of a lack of organizational leadership.    2. (S/NF) Nourizadeh on the Election's Aftermath:  UK-based broadcaster and commentator Alireza Nourizadeh told us July 5 that he remains in contact with Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, and that their efforts to protest the election had entered a new phase.  Nourizadeh, in Dubai for meetings with various sources, said more protests were being planned for July 9, around the anniversary of the student uprisings in 1999, but that the opposition would generally forego confrontations with security forces in favor of acts of civil disobedience. Mousavi, he assured us, was prepared for a long struggle and ready to put himself at risk.  He noted, however, that for the immediate future, Mousavi would not venture out but that Karroubi would travel to cities outside Tehran.  Nourizadeh said opposition leaders and supporters are using various means of communication, including phone and e-mail trees, to circumvent restrictions on SMS services and the internet.  Nourizadeh also told us that five satellite phones had recently been smuggled into Iran. Mousavi, Karroubi, and former President Khatami each had one and more were being procured.  As an aside, he noted radio broadcasting would remain the most effective way to reach the largest portion of the Iranian public and lamented the lack of medium-wave radio broadcasts into Iran by VOA and other foreign broadcasters. Among his other points:    - Rafsanjani had secured 41 signatures from members of the Assembly of Experts but had realized he did not have sufficient support in the assembly to take action against the Supreme Leader.  He had turned his attention to other avenues to support the opposition. Rafsanjani also recognized that the regime could pressure him by acting against his children and was proceeding cautiously.    - Mojtaba Khamenei was the force behind the crackdown and was adamant there could be no compromise.  Others in the Supreme Leader's circle had wanted some accommodation with Mousavi and even proposed cabinet positions in the current administration for his supporters or offering Mousavi the presidency in 2013. Nourizadeh said their proposal had even been presented to Mousavi, who refused.    - Nourizadeh also told us that there were "prominent people" in Iran who may flee the country and approach US Embassies about refugee status in the US.  He promised to update us with specific information if some of them decided to depart Iran.    3. (S/NF) Comment: Nourizadeh, an Iranian nationalist opposed to the regime who often notes his sensational reporting has led to regime-backed threats to his security, was insistent that the opposition was going to continue to press its case and the calm of the past few days had been a lull while it shifted tactics.  DUBAI 00000280  002.2 OF 003   In response to the mention of potential refugee cases, we briefly outlined the US refugee resettlement program and emphasized that the process can be a lengthy one, further complicated by conditions in the host country.    4. (S) Northern Tehranis Claim Rafsanjani Vulnerable in a New Revolution:  An IRPO contact with whom we meet when he is in Dubai and his brother claimed that the Iranian public did not differentiate between Rafsanjani and the rest of the elite in its disdain for the current regime.  If another revolution were to occur, our contact said, Rafsanjani would be killed along with the rest of the IRIG leadership.  Our contact repeated this assertion several times, despite noting that they were eagerly watching Rafsanjani's role in the elite wrangling.  The brothers were of two minds regarding the future of the government; one believes the people are afraid and will not be able to affect change while the other thought change was still possible.  They agreed, however, that the protests are about gaining more freedom and not Mousavi.  Comment:  Their insistence that Rafsanjani faces a grim fate were another revolution to occur highlights the delicacy of Rafsanjani's position.  Rafsanjani seems threatened both by other elements of the regime as well as by a popular revolt, giving him little maneuverability. This IRPO contact is generally apolitical and his views probably reflect the northern Tehran elite rather than those of politically-minded intellectuals.    5. (C) Ahmadinejad Promises "Active Role" on the World Stage: President Ahmadinejad, who has maintained an unusually low profile since the disputed June 12 election, gave a thirty-minute address on state television last night in which he deemed the election the freest in the world and the healthiest in the Islamic Republic's 30-year history.  In a nod to widespread discontent, he promised to tackle economic issues first and reduce social restrictions on youths.  In a lengthy discourse on Iran's role in the world, AN refuted criticisms from his election rivals that Iran had suffered due to his mismanagement of Iran's foreign policy.  Iran can not progress domestically, he argued, without a dynamic foreign policy because the Arrogant Powers of the world "do not want Iran to succeed."  Comment: At times, AN's remarks were unusually conciliatory.  In contrast to his press conference after the election, he did not disparage his rivals in the election or their supporters.  His admission that the economy needed urgent attention is also notable, given his past bravado regarding the "successes" of his economic agenda.  However, AN's accusation of foreign interference in the election and his argument for Iran's continuing "active role" in the world illustrate that while he may be softening his approach to his domestic audience, his outward belligerence will likely continue.    6. (S) Esfahan Bazaari Says Bazaar's Influence Waning: An Iranian carpet merchant who has been selling carpets for 50 years said the bazaar is no longer as cohesive a community as it used to be and blamed the government for the change. There is little connection between different bazaars, such as those in Tabriz, Tehran and Esfahan, and the connections among merchants within the bazaars are weaker too.  He said the government gives preferential loans to favored merchants.  The bazaari and his wife differed on the degree of support within the Esfahan bazaar for Ahmadinejad and Mousavi-she thought Mousavi had a great deal of support while he thought Ahmadinejad had strong support-but agreed that the bazaars had closed for only a few days in protest and that not all of the shops had closed.    The couple made other points about life in Esfahan:    - The Iftikaf holiday is no longer widely supported; they said that in the past only Basijis and Sepahis observe the holiday. The couple then criticized the government for driving people away from religion.    - Approximately 70 to 80 percent of Esfahanis have satellite dishes and he bragged that he has three.  Security forces had collected a few dishes in Esfahan but not many; the security forces were only collecting dishes from apartment buildings and  DUBAI 00000280  003.2 OF 003   not from private homes. Another IRPO contact in the past said the security forces also ignore satellite dishes in private homes.    7. (S) Comment: The couple was openly critical of the government throughout our conversation but without justifying or explaining their criticism. He did say that his business had been much better before the revolution and as a result seems to harbor a grievance against the current government. Although openly supportive of Mousavi, he did not seem to be tracking the political crisis very closely and did not give the impression that the bazaar was ready to stand up on behalf on Mousavi.    8. (C) Iran Still Open for Tourists:  We spoke to a Dubai-based American who went to Iran as a tourist from June 18 through July 3.  Our contact, a professor at a local university, told us he had seen the margins of some of the demonstrations in Tehran, getting a whiff of tear gas in the process and his companion being sternly warned about taking pictures of the Basij in the streets.  Otherwise, they had no problems.  Their travel between Tehran and several other cities were not restricted, nor was their tour guide reticent in complaining about the election outcome and crackdown.  Iranians he met along the way told him consistently, but only in private, the election was a farce and the heavy handed way it had been given to Ahmadinejad was an insult to the people's intelligence.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: A fertilizer factory owner who was applying for a visa in Dubai recently spoke with IRPO regarding Iran's agriculture sector, the role of economics in the presidential election, and subsidy reform. He considered Iran's water shortage and limited access to capital for fixed investments the main challenges facing Iran's agriculture sector.  He knewseveral colleagues who supported Mahmoud Ahmadinejad because of the financial assistance the president has provided to the provinces, and he suspected that many rural Iranians voted for Ahmadinejad because they did not know what kind of economic benefits to expect from the other candidates. He did not think unemployment and inflation are worrisome and supported subsidy reform because it will allow him to sell his fertilizer at a higher price. He also said that Iranians are ready for a complete elimination of gasoline subsidies but denigrated the current proposed legislation. End Summary.    2. (C) The agricultural industrialist, who owns a factory in Kerman Province that produces pistachio fertilizer, employs 53 workers and is a member of the Kerman Chamber of Commerce. He has a degree in Chemical Engineering, and as the father of three university-educated children, he likely is better off financially than most Iranians. His main clients are domestic and include the government, but his chamber membership has afforded him international contacts, specifically in the U.S., Germany, and Turkey.    The Problems of the Agriculture Sector  --------------------------------------    3. (C) The industrialist said that the key problems of Iran's agriculture sector are the ongoing, three-year drought and the lack of access to capital to purchase equipment. The drought has hit agriculture hard. The pistachio is one of the most resistant crops to drought, but this year, even pistachio farmers are having difficulty. This was compounded by farmers' having to compete with cheaper U.S. pistachio imports (Note: Certain U.S. agricultural products, including pistachios, can be legally exported to Iran with a license from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control). The government's main response to the water shortage is building dams, but the factory owner derided this effort, as the droughts weaken the dams' effectiveness. (Note: Iran frequently lauds its dam construction projects, which according to Iranian press number the highest in the world.) The government is also building irrigation systems, which have helped some, but he said there are few infrastructural improvements the government can implement to ease the drought. He said the agriculture sector further suffers from inefficient and outdated equipment and without investment, there is little the government can do to compensate for the deficiency.    Not Buying the Anti-Ahmadinejad Rhetoric on the Economy  --------------------------------------------- ----------    4. (C) The industrialist viewed the emphasis on the economy in the election as more about attacking other candidates rather than improving it, and he noted that none of the candidates focused on Iran's agriculture sector. When asked about the Ahmadinejad-Rezai debate -- the vast majority of which focused on the economy -- he maintained that their discussion of the economy was merely a political tool. He was more focused on his daily operations, loans, and taxes. On unemployment and inflation, he said, "Prices go up and down for different things, but this is normal", and he claimed to have heard few complaints about unemployment.(Comment: As a financially successful business owner, he and his social circle are more insulated from job shortages and can better afford rising prices. Additionally, Kerman Province, whose economy is largely based on agriculture and whose workforce includes a large portion of Afghan migrants, enjoys a lower rate of unemployment than the rest of Iran.)    5. (C) He suspected that many rural Iranians voted for Ahmadinejad because they knew they could expect financial assistance from him and did not want to risk electing a candidate whose plans were unknown. Although there were small protests in Kerman immediately following the election, they  DUBAI 00000281  002.2 OF 002   fizzled out quickly and did not affect his business' operations. He noted, however, that Kerman is known in Iran as a relatively quiet province.    Subsidy Reform Good for Business  --------------------------------    6. (C) The industrialist believed that Iranians are ready for subsidy reforms and views legislation as necessary and beneficial. He complained that the government's basic fertilizer subsidy prevents him from selling his product at a higher price. Among his colleagues, this was a main reason for their support for cutting subsidies. He also supported cutting water and electricity subsidies to reduce consumption and allow fairer competition.  Nevertheless, he criticized the targeted subsidy legislation currently being considered by the Majles because he does not believe that replacing subsidies with cash payments is meaningful reform or progress.    7. (C) Comment: The fertilizer factory owner's consistent downplaying of unemployment and inflation is unique in light of the focus on the economy during the election. As an educated business owner, his perspective underscores the difference in how Ahmadinejad's economic policies may be viewed in large urban and industrial areas, like Tabriz and Tehran, versus slower and more agricultural cities, like Kerman. End Comment. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Several Iranian business contacts told IRPO that business was on hold in the aftermath of the election, and all doubted that their businesses could survive much longer. Goods are not clearing customs, clients are not placing orders, no money is moving out, revenues are falling, and traditional money movers such as sarafs are not exchanging money. The post-election turmoil has exacerbated financial difficulties they are experiencing due to the global recession, sanctions, and commercial pressure on Iran over the nuclear issue. Our contacts noted that diminished unrest may help business return to normal, but they no longer had hopes for private-sector development in the next four years. Accordingly, some lamented that because they can not afford to run their business under sanctions and face unfriendly treatment from the state, they may undertake other lines of business or leave Iran. End summary.    Hard Times Getting Harder  -------------------------    2. (S/NF) A regular IRPO contact who owns a Tehran-based factory employing 1,000 Iranians on July 9 told us that he feared that his business would not survive past two weeks if the uncertain business climate continued. Although Iranian ports were receiving shipments, goods were not clearing customs, and they were building up at the ports. Our contact said he has limited his stock to less than two weeks' worth of inventory and has run out of some raw materials because of customs delays. The only thing keeping him in business is the trade at the Iraqi border. Ease of getting products into Iraq and trade with the Kurds are providing his company with much needed liquidity. His normal monthly revenue of USD 1.39 million trading this way, nevertheless, has only netted USD 278,000 to USD 417,000 so far in July.  His suppliers are pressuring him to increase turnover, but he has told them there is nothing he can do.    3. (C) Establishing trust with Iran's state apparatus has become the most important tool in our contacts' attempts to remain in business. IRPO contacts working with Iranian brokers as of last week had found it increasingly hard to move their goods out of Tehran's Bazaar. An Iranian businessman in the steel sector said July 7 that he had recently discovered that a consignment of Chinese steel he sent to Tehran's Bazaar before the election had not been released because of, according to his distributor, political turmoil. Moreover, domestic importers were very reluctant to sign contracts without a significant level of trust. Along with bazaari and distributors, the importers were not interested in establishing new relationships because of the political uncertainty. Domestic and international business, according to him, was on hold and he was finding it very difficult to make a living because "there [was] nothing going on."    Credit Tightens  ---------------    4. (C) Iranian businessmen also as of last week were struggling to move money. The factory owner has returned several times to Tehran, most recently to try to secure financing. Normally, Iranian businesses used Iranian banks and sarafs, which increasingly were necessary because of US, UN, and EU sanctions on Iranian banks. He maintained, however, that it had become very expensive to use sarafs since the election because they were constantly increasing their surcharges and some were reluctant to release their US dollar holdings. His factory has been unable to transfer money out of Iran.    5. (S/NF) US, UN, and EU restrictions on Iranian banks and financial pressure over Iran's nuclear issue have made this problem particularly prescient during the post-election period. Sanctions have limited our contacts' businesses' ability to obtain credit from Iranian banks, which are themselves increasingly unable to afford to issue credit. Several businessmen explained that it has become all the more crucial to  DUBAI 00000285  002 OF 002   establish new relationships and levels of trust with state bank managers in order to conduct business. The factory owner recounted the many times he has had to court state bank managers to provide credit. He has started with small loans, but hopes in time this will grow.    Potential Political Retaliation  -------------------------------    6. (C) The factory owner told us that he and his business acquaintances feared that the state will begin discriminating against businesses owned by people thought to be affiliated with the opposition, for example, by making it harder for them to establish credit and obtain loans and licenses by raising fees, extending waiting periods, and red tape. The factory owner thought this will abate eventually, but his other business acquaintances disagreed. This concern, according to him, has contributed to an overall feeling of hopelessness among the business community for Iran's economic development. Many IRPO contacts have maintained they were optimistic about opportunities to interact with the US before the election, but they are now considering leaving Iran or pursuing other business opportunities.    7. (S/NF) Comment: Our contacts' experiences suggest that the private sector will continue to struggle under Ahmadinejad's presidency. This is not likely to translate into contempt for the regime however, as many Iranian businessmen have said they are more likely to leave Iran or seek other business ventures than channel their frustrations politically. The recent experiences of our business contacts underscore sanctions' potency in combination with Iran's mismanagement and highlight their negative impact on the private sector. Accordingly, state domination of the economy somewhat insulates the regime from the woes of the private sector. In the interim, our contacts will continue to struggle for survival amid the economic and political uncertainty, with some expressing the hope that the relatively limited July 9 protests may soon revive economic activity.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S) Iranian Doctor Alleges Many More Deaths Than Officially Acknowledged: A gynecologist applying for a visa in Dubai described a frenetic scene in the hospitals during the unrest sparked by the disputed election.  He was called in to provide support and ended up working three straight shifts - even though he does not typically support emergency room operations.  He said the private Tehran hospital where he works took steps to prevent the IRIG from identifying the wounded by both quickly discharging patients following treatment and by deliberately collecting incorrect information from the patients, such as writing down the wrong name or address. Personnel at the government-run hospitals, he understood, were forced to collect accurate information. Government authorities came to the hospital to identify those treated during the unrest but such visits have now stopped.  The doctor's wife said she had heard from an eye surgeon that he had operated on 15 patients who had suffered eye wounds after being shot with rubber bullets.  The couple alleged that at least 200 people died during the unrest, basing their claim on comments from other doctors, who had all said 15 or had died at their respective hospitals.  It is now rumored that the government has paid off the families of those killed to keep them quiet.  Comment:  The doctor and his wife were open in their criticism of the IRIG and, interestingly, are themselves vivid examples of some Iranians' fixation with Britain's supposedly malign intentions toward Iran.  While they did not allege that the UK was responsible for the unrest, as the IRIG asserts, they generally held the UK responsible many of Iran's current problems.  The doctor's comment regarding what happened in the hospital where he works seemed to accurately reflect what he saw and heard first-hand, but given the couple's penchant for conspiracy theories, it is impossible to gauge the accuracy of the other rumors they heard.  That said, there is strong anecdotal reporting to suggest that the number of those killed and seriously injured is higher than the IRIG's officially reported tallies.    2. (S/NF) Revolutionary Guards Take Prominent Role in Recent Political Detentions:  The family of detained economic analyst Bijan Khajehpour has been told (unofficially) by a senior judiciary official that he is under the control of the Revolutionary Guards, rather than the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, as the family first suspected.  The same source told them that Khajehpour was moved from Evin Prison to an unknown location several days ago.  Comment:  If confirmed, the IRGC, which was reportedly also responsible for the re-arrest over the weekend of Iranian-American Kian Tajbakhsh, is moving into territory traditionally dominated by the MOIS.  A Dubai-based friend of Tajbakhsh, who has had his own problems with Iran's intelligence service, told us that Tajbakhsh was in good standing with his MOIS "parole officer" at the time of his re-arrest and was abiding by the terms of his "probation" (i.e., not engaging with international organizations).    3. (S/NF) Austrian Ambassador to Tehran Pays Price for Supporting Saberi: Austria's Ambassador to Tehran will be leaving Iran early after pressure from IRIG officials unhappy with his activism on behalf of the Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi, according to a Dubai-based Iranian political consultant.  The long-standing IRPO contact said that earlier this week he approached Austrian diplomats to request that they quietly lobby the IRIG on behalf of Bijan Khajehpour, his former business partner and a prominent analyst, who was arrested last month upon his return from a business trip to Europe.  The Austrians, who know Khajehpour well, explained that they had spent all their "political capital" on behind-the-scenes advocacy for Saberi's release from prison earlier this year, and that as a consequence Ambassador Postle is being "forced out" of Iran early. Comment: If accurate, the early departure of the Austrian Ambassador suggests that even the influence of Western governments usually viewed with less antagonism by hardliners is diminishing.    4. (C) Some Working Class Iranians "Oblivious" to Recent Unrest:  An Iranian engineer and factory owner observed that the three dozen workers at his small valve manufacturing plant 30 km outside of Tehran were mostly "oblivious" to the recent unrest over the disputed election.  He explained that after the first week of large-scale demonstrations, which were covered (to an extent) by state media, many working class Iranians had little awareness of the continuing turmoil.

(S/NF) Austrian Ambassador to Tehran Pays Price for Supporting Saberi: Austria's Ambassador to Tehran will be leaving Iran early after pressure from IRIG officials unhappy with his activism on behalf of the Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi, according to a Dubai-based Iranian political consultant.  The long-standing IRPO contact said that earlier this week he approached Austrian diplomats to request that they quietly lobby the IRIG on behalf of Bijan Khajehpour, his former business partner and a prominent analyst, who was arrested last month upon his return from a business trip to Europe.  The Austrians, who know Khajehpour well, explained that they had spent all their "political capital" on behind-the-scenes advocacy for Saberi's release from prison earlier this year, and that as a consequence Ambassador Postle is being "forced out" of Iran early. Comment: If accurate, the early departure of the Austrian Ambassador suggests that even the influence of Western governments usually viewed with less antagonism by hardliners is diminishing.    4. (C) Some Working Class Iranians "Oblivious" to Recent Unrest:  An Iranian engineer and factory owner observed that the three dozen workers at his small valve manufacturing plant 30 km outside of Tehran were mostly "oblivious" to the recent unrest over the disputed election.  He explained that after the first week of large-scale demonstrations, which were covered (to an extent) by state media, many working class Iranians had little awareness of the continuing turmoil.  His employees, who don't  DUBAI 00000288  002 OF 002   use the Internet and do not live or work near the locations of the subsequent protests, expressed skepticism when the factory owner recently suggested that election controversy was not yet over.  Our contact added that while his employees do have access to satellite television, they tend to be wary of foreign news channels and assume that like Iranian state television and radio, all media promote political agendas.  The factory owner said that "all but two" of his employees told him they voted for Ahmadinejad, and pointed to the 50,000 toman ($50) vouchers they received at an Ahmadinejad rally just before the election as having won them over.  Our contact said he jokingly warned his employees that they should complain directly to Ahmadinejad when he has to close his business and the factory as a result of the failing economy. Comment: The attitude of the factory workers suggests that the state's monopoly of media remains an effective curb on information, particularly for Iranians without access to the Internet.  The workers' attitude also shows that there are Iranians who supported Ahmadinejad and will not question the subsequent government's legitimacy.    5. (C) Economic Constraints Prevent Factory Closure in Support of Mousavi:  The same factory owner said that he had been unable to close his factory in solidarity with the demonstrators, despite his own wish to tangibly support the movement.  He explained that outstanding loans as well as unfilled orders meant that they could not close down temporarily without risking the complete collapse of the company, which manufactures gas valves for LPG cylinders.  Our contact said that he and the factory manager had even explored the possibility of speeding up production to stockpile inventory so that they could shut down for a few months, but had concluded that even this approach was not feasible.  Comment: This anecdote tracks with what we have heard from numerous small business owners and even some public sector employees, who say that they are too economically vulnerable to risk losing their businesses or jobs by participating in a strike.    6. (S/NF) Institute in Orumiyeh Voluntarily Closes to Avoid Post-Election Trouble: The director of a private English-language institute in the northwestern city of Orumiyeh told us that he had chosen to close the institute voluntarily during the recent unrest to avoid the attention of authorities. The local office of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance had ordered the institute closed about two months ago amid an inquiry of charges that it was "introducing Western culture." After a week, the director said, he and his partners succeeded in getting well-placed officials in Tehran to intervene and re-opened the school.  The decision to close after the election was made to avoid any appearance that the institute was in any way involved in the protests that took place in Orumiyeh after the election and invite further scrutiny by the security services.  He added that demonstrations in Orumiyeh were much smaller than elsewhere and voters more discrete in their support for Mousavi, in large part because of a large MOIS regional office there. Comment: Our contact remains eager to develop relationships with US universities and regularly contacts us via phone and e-mail from Iran.  Asked if his contacts with IRPO may have led to his problems, he intimated that his family had powerful friends in Tehran who were supportive of greater educational ties between Iran and the US.  His problems most likely had come from zealous local officials, he said, and he felt safe in continuing contacts with us.    7. (C) Suffering for Art's Sake:  An Iranian artist and gallery owner told us this week that many Iranian artists were moving further underground or selling their art abroad.  She said that Iranian gallery owners and artists had come under more intense scrutiny in the past year, after an ill-advised exhibition that included paintings showing nudity.  Authorities had required all galleries to be re-licensed and conducted background checks on the owners and had raided the homes of some art owners to confiscate "immoral" paintings.  Further, the conservative cleric recently named to head the agency licensing art galleries had stated that Islam and religious themes were the only suitable subjects for artists.  The Ahmadinejad administration had also stated its intent to stop all government support for artists.  Asked about Mir Hossein Mousavi's presidency at the Iranian Academy of Arts, she said he had done very little to support artists although the art community had expected greater freedom if he had been elected.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: With his call on the government to "restore the people's trust" in the Islamic Republic's leadership after the disputed election, Rafsanjani used the Tehran Friday Prayers pulpit to defy both public expectations and the Supreme Leader's edict to accept Ahmadinejad's win.  His unexpectedly bold sermon was matched by the return of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to the streets of Tehran, and followed by a challenge from former President Khatami to the government to hold a national referendum on the legitimacy of the next Ahmadinejad government.  Though their demands are unlikely to addressed by the government in the near-term, the continued defiance of key leaders aligned with the opposition presents Supreme Leader Khamenei with a dilemma:  allowing high-profile figures to continue stirring the pot will no doubt embolden critics of the government at both the popular and elite levels; yet taking the measures required to forcibly silence the top leadership of the opposition would very likely unleash another wave of popular dissent, while further exacerbating the fissures within the ruling establishment.  Either way, a return to political stability in Iran appears to be a long way off.  End summary.    Rafsanjani and Opposition Keep Election Dispute Alive    2. (C) Ayatollah Rafsanjani is a political survivor who usually avoids speaking directly and his public comments regarding the election before last week had been typically ambiguous. On Friday, however, Rafsanjani was uncharacteristically direct: he called for those detained since the election to be released from prison; said the media should not be "limited"; and most importantly, essentially alleged that the conduct and outcome of the election had sacrificed Iran's republican character.    3. (C) Voicing their own frustration with the downfall of Iranian republicanism, Iran's public returned to the streets in droves to hear Rafsanjani and protest yet again. Although the first few rows of the prayer grounds were filled by Ahmadinejad and Khamenei supporters, the crowd appeared to be dominated by Mousavi's backers.  Estimates indicate that anywhere from thousands to a million people turned out, and the state-run Press TV reported hundreds of thousands were on hand for Rafsanjani's address.    4. (C) Former President Khatami later praised Rafsanjani's sermon and called for a national referendum on the legitimacy of the government.  He said only a referendum can resolve Iran's current crisis; if the majority supports Iran's government, they too will accept the outcome.  (Note: Although unspecified, Khatami is probably referring to the legitimacy of the Ahmadinejad administration, not the legitimacy of the Islamic system.)    Opposition's Resilience Puts Khamenei in Dilemma    5. (C) Rafsanjani's Friday prayer sermon and Khatami's call for a referendum are unlikely to yield concrete concessions from Supreme Leader Khamenei or the Ahmadinejad government in the near term.  Political prisoners arrested after the election, for example, are not likely to be released and a referendum also is highly unlikely.  As yet, Khamenei has not indicated any willingness to compromise.  Predictably, hardline clerics, such as Ahmadinejad's spiritual mentor Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, and the conservative press reacted harshly to Rafsanjani's speech. The newspaper Keyhan, whose editor is appointed by Khamenei, complained that Rafsanjani should have explained that the issue of the election is closed and that the protests should end.    6. (C) Comment:  The significance of the weekend's events lies in the willingness of the opposition to keep challenging the legitimacy of the election.  By keeping the issue alive, Rafsanjani and Khatami are implicitly defying the Supreme Leader, who has deemed the election valid.  Their readiness to  DUBAI 00000293  002.2 OF 002   continue their challenge - and willingness of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to risk the brutality of the security forces - places Khamenei in a difficult position.  Allowing Rafsanjani, Khatami, and the rest of the opposition to continue agitating will no doubt embolden critics of the government at both the popular and elite levels. Yet forcibly silencing the top leadership figures of the opposition will undoubtedly unleash another wave of popular dissent, while further exacerbating the fissures within the ruling establishment. Either way, a return to political stability in Iran appears to be a long way off. End comment. RICHARDSON 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000297  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  7/22/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, IR SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE DUBAI: WINDOW ON IRAN - JULY 22, 2009  DUBAI 00000297  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S) IRGC Assumes Control: An Iranian journalist working for a Western wire service told us July 18 that the IRGC had asserted its authority "to protect the revolution" and assumed control of the IRIG's response to the protest.  In the process, he said, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) had been supplanted.  It had been the IRGC that arrested journalists and others, in what he described as a preventative effort to disrupt the opposition's ability to publicly criticize the government. He asserted that journalists, including his close contact journalist and economist Saeed Laylaz, were not being "punished" but would be held until things calmed down.  He said that four videographers working in his office had been briefly detained during the initial protests, and that his service had been barred from using IRIB facilities to uplink video feeds to the service's headquarters in New York.  Turning to the election, although it was fraud that returned Ahmadinejad to office, he cautioned against underestimating his support throughout the country and overestimating the strength of the opposition. Western journalists and commentators were quick to extrapolate what was happening in Tehran to the rest of the country, leading to an inaccurate picture of events, he said.  Comment: Our contact corroborated what we've heard from other sources about the IRGC's control of the response and being responsible for the arrests that have taken place.    2. (S/NF) Fars News Maintains Interest in US Bureau:  Our contact separately told us he had been approached by representatives of the semi-official Fars News Agency about their desire to open a US bureau.  They continued to maintain they had been refused permission, although when pressed, they could not provide details on to whom they applied or what process they were using.  Nevertheless, he said, he feared that the IRIG would "retaliate" by placing further restrictions on Western journalists.  Comment:  This is the second time Fars has approached this news service about a US bureau, and we're told it is because the Iranians are erroneously assuming that this service is quasi-governmental, like Fars. (Note: Fars, established in 2002, is privately-owned but strongly aligned with President Ahmadinejad.)    3. (S/NF) Advertisers Pulling Ads from IRIB: Executives of Farsi1, a joint venture between News Corp subsidiary StarTV and Dubai-based Moby Group, told us Western advertisers were pulling or delaying advertising campaigns on state-run IRIB amid the post-election unrest.  The companies involved were primarily Japanese, including Sony, Bridgestone, and Toshiba.  According to our contact, these companies and others were expressing interest in shifting their advertising to Farsi1 to protect their image.  Farsi1 begins broadcasting August 1 and will show Western entertainment programs, such as 24 and X Files, dubbed into Farsi. Comment:  Lost advertising would be a further indication of international displeasure with the IRIG response, and companies' concerns about damage to their international reputation would be a further disincentive to investment in Iran.    4. (S/NF) Iranians Open to Foreign-based Opposition Leadership?:  During a discussion of the continued detention of many senior reformers, a Dubai-based Iranian political analyst well known to IRPO suggested that the movement may need foreign-based leadership to persevere.  He argued that many Iranians would be open to foreign-based leadership and explained that attitudes toward Iranian ex-pats vary based on the timing of their departure from Iran.  Those who left early on after the Revolution, whom he dismissed as monarchists, have lost credibility with the Iranian population.  However, Iranians may not carry the same grudge against those who left later on for specific reasons, such as to pursue higher education.  He cited Akbar Ganji and Ahmad Batebi as examples of Iranians who left only after having have suffered at the hand of the government, suggesting that these individuals could still attract support from Iranians.  Comment:  Foreign-led opposition groups -- be they ethnic minority groups, monarchists, or the MEK -- since the Revolution have garnered little popular support inside Iran; the possibility that this may changing represents a new vulnerability to the IRIG.  The popular movement sparked by the disputed election appears to hold broader appeal among Iran's diverse population than previous opposition groups, and the widespread arrests of reformist leaders in Iran suggest that the  DUBAI 00000297  002.2 OF 002   longevity of the movement may eventually require foreign-based leadership.  As such, our contact's suggestion is plausible.  At the same time, IRPO has not seen indications that Iranians are looking abroad for leadership or that any ex-pat Iranians are attempting to provide such leadership to those in Iran.    5. (S/NF) Iran-China Energy Cooperation "Ruining" Iran's Oil Sector:  IRPO contacts in Iran's oil sector have criticized China's involvement in Iran's energy projects and view the government's recent advertising campaign for Iran-China cooperation as "bad news" for the oil sector.  An Iran-based managing director of a engineering company characterized Iran's recent talks with two Asian banks on the USD 1.4 billion bond for South Pars gas field as a "slippery slope" and expressed concern that Iran will grow increasingly dependent on China for development financing as Western companies concede to international pressure and limit their business in Iran's energy sector. As a result, over the long-term Iran's oil sector will suffer.  Several contacts claim China's work is subpar and does not meet Western or international standards. Although Chinese companies are increasingly active  in Iran, their activities thus far have been limited to smaller projects like Masjid-e-Suleyman oil field because the Chinese have yet to develop and master the technology required for larger and more complex projects, such as North Azadegan and Yadaveran. One executive working on South Pars claimed that China is using its smaller, cheaper projects, such as the development of Masjed-e-Suleyman (valued at less than USD 200 million), as "practice" as they develop their own technology and techniques. Our contacts note that after years of working with the West, they have found it difficult to relate to the Chinese. Language barriers impede communication with Chinese workers, greatly complicating joint ventures and technology transfers. Moreover, Chinese companies reportedly often insist on using their own labor, meaning the projects do not bring jobs to Iranians. Indeed, an Iranian newspaper earlier this month ran a headline criticizing Ahmadinejad for giving jobs to the Chinese. However, despite their misgivings, the oil businessmen all acknowledged that the insolvency of Iran's banks has frozen domestic-led energy sector development, and that Iran has no choice but to work with China. An Iranian businessman who works closely with both the National Iranian Oil Company and National Iranian Gas Company even admitted that  the government in some cases has awarded tenders to Chinese companies over Iranian ones because of the cheaper bids, in effect sacrificing quality for price.    6. (C) Seismologist Warns Iran Not Prepared for Major Earthquake:  A seismologist from Iran's International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), who was in Dubai to pick up her visa, warned that Iran is due for another earthquake and the Iranian government is ill-prepared to handle a disaster similar to the 2003 Bam earthquake.  Although every new building is legally required to meet earthquake safety standards, she said that in reality few are ever actually tested.  The seismologist said that while the government listens when the IIEES warns of the potential danger of another major earthquake, disaster preparedness is "not their priority." Tehran, which she claims lies on  ten major fault lines, is too congested and  overdeveloped for an effective search-and-rescue effort to be implemented  if a large  earthquake were to strike the city.   The seismologist, who is traveling to Los Angeles for an earthquake drill, said that Iran's earthquake disaster management community works closely with its European and U.S. counterparts, and she claimed that Iranians still speak of the hospitality and kindness of Americans who set up field hospitals after the 2003 Bam earthquake.  Commenting on the disputed election and the recent unrest, she said that the majority of her colleagues are Western educated and supported reformers in the June 12 election.  Although many wanted to join the protests, as employees of the IIEES they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology and they feared they would lose their jobs.  Instead, many at the IIEES were as of last week participating in their own "informal strike" by working at half-pace. RICHARDSON 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000301  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  7/27/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: SUPREME LEADER-AHMADINEJAD TUSSLE OVER NOMINEE BRINGS CONSERVATIVE DISARRAY INTO THE OPEN  DUBAI 00000301  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Supreme Leader Khamenei's intervention in a dispute among conservatives over President Ahmadinejad's pick for first vice president has further strained his status as the unchallenged arbiter of Iranian politics.  Though Ahmadinejad did ultimately bow to the Supreme Leader's directive to remove Mashaei as vice president, Khamenei's victory was proved glaringly hollow by Ahmadinejad's decision to circumvent his critics by declaring Mashaei to be his chief of staff.    2. (C) Summary cont.: In the midst of the Mashaei drama, which has thrown Ahmadinejad's cabinet into disarray, the government was also compelled for the first time since the election to publicly acknowledge the death of a demonstrator while in custody.  The brutal beating death of the son of an establishment figure has led many once-quiescent conservatives to publicly question the government's handling of the unrest and call for an investigation into the detainees' treatment -- stances that echo the demands of Mousavi, Karrubi and Rafsanjani.  Perhaps in response to these challenges, the Supreme Leader's backers have resorted to issuing a flurry of statements of support that seem to highlight, rather than minimize, division among the establishment.  Amid declarations that "202 Majles members" and "the majority of the Assembly of Experts" support the views of the Supreme Leader, the Revolutionary Guards stand out as a glaring exception to this sense that cohesion among the conservative establishment is fraying.  In our view, events of the past week suggest that the Supreme Leader's political maneuverability is diminished, and he is ever more reliant on the IRGC. End summary.    Mashaei's "Resignation" Exposes Disarray Among Conservatives    3. (C) On July 25, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei announced that he "no longer considered himself to be first vice president," as Ahmadinejad grudgingly bowed to the Supreme Leader after digging in his heels and enduring nine days of withering criticism from conservative politicians and senior clerics who had immediately -- and very publicly -- objected to Ahmadinejad's elevation of his friend (and relative by marriage) to first vice president. Though conservatives ostensibly object to Mashaei for a 2008 comment viewed as "soft" on Israel and for his attendance at an "un-Islamic" cultural event in Turkey, an editorial in a newspaper affiliated with the radical hardliner Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi criticized him for overstepping the boundaries of a layman by speculating publicly on theological issues such as religious pluralism.  Other non-clerical figures in the principlist camp lamented the appointment as an indication that Ahmadinejad intends to staff his office and cabinet with his inner coterie at the expense of consensus figures.  When Ahmadinejad held his ground, Khamenei sent a directive to Ahmadinejad advising him to undo the appointment; remarkably, Ahmadinejad only yielded after the Supreme Leader's handwritten letter, sent five days earlier, was published by the state media, thus forcing Ahmadinejad's hand.  To add insult to injury, Ahmadinejad simply reassigned Mashaei as his chief of staff.    4. (C) Following the Mashaei resignation, Ahmadinejad abruptly dismissed his Minister of Intelligence July 26 while the Minister of Culture reportedly resigned amid reports the President was trying to force him out.  Both men objected to the Mashaei appointment and walked out of a cabinet meeting last week following a well-publicized argument with Ahmadinejad.  It is unclear if Ahmadinejad consulted with Khamenei before sacking the two ministers; appointments to these ministries are generally coordinated with, if not mandated by, the Supreme Leader.  According to Iran's constitution, Ahmadinejad's entire cabinet now requires parliamentary review; however, it is unclear if the Majles has the authority or political will to initiate such a challenge before Ahmadinejad is inaugurated for his second term on August 5.    Detainee Death Further Undermines Conservative Unity    5. (C) In the midst of the Mashaei drama, the establishment has also been forced to reckon with the consequences of its  DUBAI 00000301  002.2 OF 003   repression of demonstrators with the case of Mohsen Ruholamini, the 25-year-old son of a prominent conservative who was arrested in street demonstrations on July 9 and died several days later, apparently as a result of wounds inflicted after he was taken to Evin Prison.  Ruholamini's father, a doctor who is described in the press as a senior advisor to defeated presidential candidate and former Revolutionary Guards chief Mohsen Rezai, appears to be well respected, both personally and professionally, by IRIG heavyweights such as the (Supreme Leader-appointed) head of all state broadcasting as well as numerous principlist MPs.  These friendships transcended the fagade of conservative unity and resulted in a full-fledged funeral for Ruholamini in a large mosque in Tehran -- the first public ceremony for a demonstrator permitted by the government -- and elicited statements of unequivocal condemnation from conservative Majles members who until now had remained silent on the issue of the abuse of detainees, heretofore described as "rioters" by government hardliners.    6. (C) Perhaps sensing momentum on this issue, reformist opposition leaders were quick to try to leverage Ruholamini's violent death, issuing a flurry of statements building on Rafsanjani's July 17 call for the release of prisoners detained since the election. The day of Ruholamini's funeral, which was attended by many government officials (including a representative of the Supreme Leader), Mousavi and Karroubi sent a letter to the Interior Ministry requesting a permit to hold a commemoration ceremony for the other individuals killed since the election.  According to state-affiliated media, the reformers promised the ceremony, scheduled for July 30 to mark the fortieth day of the demonstrators killed on June 20 (among them the now-iconic Neda Soltan), would include only Koranic recitations and all participants will be silent throughout the event.    7. (C) The outcry over the treatment of detainees is also spilling over into the issue of forced confessions, specifically whether or not such confessions should be broadcast on state television.  Majles members are now debating the issue, with many conservatives openly coming out against the idea, thereby coming down on the side of the argument held by the Mousavi and Rafsanjani camp.  One Majles deputy, in a swipe at the security services, suggested that if such confessions were aired, then there should also be inquiries into how they were obtained.    8. (C) With cracks among the conservative establishment seemingly widening over Ahmadinejad's appointments and the abuse of detainees, Khamenei's supporters are trying to muster public proof of fealty to the Supreme Leader.  In recent days state institutions have responded to Khamenei's pleas for unity by releasing press statements awkwardly proclaiming that "202 Majles members" and the "majority of the Assembly of Experts" support the Supreme Leader.  While clearly intended to showcase the idea that Khamenei retains the preponderance of support among conservative figures, the declarations themselves expose a public dissention among the establishment that few would have thought possible just weeks ago.    IRGC Remains Solidly Behind Khamenei    9. (C) The Revolutionary Guards' top leaders are the noteworthy exception to this trend.  While conservative cohesion is visibly fraying in many of Iran's key institutions, the IRGC leadership is going to great lengths to highlight its unwavering support for the Supreme Leader and the political structure he sits atop.  The IRGC used the occasion of Guards Corps Day on July 26 to highlight its support for the Supreme Leader and trumpet its role in safeguarding the Revolution. Although inflated rhetoric typically accompanies such events, the IRGC's role in suppressing the post-election demonstrations and its emergence as the central pillar supporting Khamenei gives their comments additional weight, particularly as divisions emerge among hardliners. A senior IRGC commander this weekend praised Khamenei's role in undermining the plots against the country and attributed the armed forces' success in defusing the plots to the recommendations and guidelines of the Leader.  Separately, an IRGC statement lauded Khamenei and condemned the  DUBAI 00000301  003.2 OF 003   post-election conduct of certain "influential political figures."  And in playing up its role as the Revolution's pre-eminent guarantor, IRGC Commander Jafari said the Guard Corps is the "sole armed and organized supporter" of the Revolution and maintained their ability to take on "soft political, cultural, and economic threats."   Comment    10. (C) Though politics in Iran are notoriously factionalized, Khamenei previously had been able to play such divisions to his advantage; now, however, the divisions seem to be a weakness for the Supreme Leader.  Khamenei has tried to portray the election unrest as merely a family squabble and has used praise, threats, and pleas to re-forge unity, or at least its fagade, to little avail. Ahmadinejad's public delay in heeding Khamenei's order to drop Mashaei -- and his subsequent installation as advisor and chief of staff -- further undermined the Supreme Leader. Meanwhile the reformers continue to defy Khamenei's orders to move on from the election dispute and in fact seem to be gaining traction among some conservatives over the emotive issue of detainees. By throwing his weight behind Ahmadinejad during the election, the Supreme Leader's political maneuverability has now been diminished and it appears he is ever more reliant on the IRGC. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Iranian businessmen who have experience with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's (IRGC) economic activities maintained that its involvement is increasing economic inefficiencies and discouraging the private sector. They lamented that without a strong challenger and President Ahmadinejad's pledge to redistribute wealth and create jobs, in part by ceding projects to the IRGC, its growing economic dominance will not abate. Our contacts believed that IRGC companies are unassailable and were adamant that Ahmadinejad has created a new patronage network that challenges the clergy. End Summary.    THE IRGC STEPS IN  -----------------------    2. (S) An Iranian general manager of a company that sells oil field development software to Iranian companies recently related to IRPO the troubles his friends have faced from the IRGC.  All the more surprising in this case was that they were generally respected because of their well-known persecution under the Shah and they were well connected. After the Revolution, the friends obtained jobs at an Iranian oil company but later started their own construction company, eventually leveraging their pre-revolutionary history to obtain the patronage of an ayatollah in Qom, whom he did not name. The company has received many contracts from this ayatollah, including the USD 600 million expansion of the Fatemeh Shrine in Qom. During Ahmadinejad's presidency, however, the IRGC has taken over at least two of their projects, including the shrine and a 16 km tunnel. After building 8km, the company was told by government officials that the IRGC would finish.    3. (C) Upon complaining to the President's Office about these interventions, the executives were told that the IRGC was given these projects to gain practical experience and improve their technical skills. Additionally, the practice was creating jobs and improving Iran's domestic capabilities. Asked how ceding projects to the Revolutionary Guard helps employment, the software executive claimed that the IRGC brings in friends, family, and people from local villages for some of its projects. (Note: Former Khatam-ol Anbia Deputy Director Abdolreza Abedzadeh in a 2006 interview stated that only 10 percent of Khatam's labor is from IRGC ranks. Khatam is reportedly the IRGC's largest construction conglomerate.) Our contacts, one of whom is involved in South Pars gas field, claim that the IRGC functions more as a general contractor and farms out portions of different projects that in some cases previously were done by one company.    EXCUSING INEFFICIENCY  --------------------------------    4. (C) Iranian businessmen think that by delaying project completion, raising government costs, and forcing out the private sector, the IRGC is doing more harm to the economy than good.  A subcontractor to one of Khatam's projects told an IRPO contact that the organization's inefficiency and poor management consistently increased the costs and delayed project completion. The same contact told IRPO that in twice the amount of time it took his friends to complete 8 km of the water tunnel, the IRGC still has not finished the final half of the project. The government, however, does not appear to see this as a detriment. Akbar Torkan, former Deputy Minister of Petroleum and Chief Executive at Petropars and Pars Oil and Gas Company, who in June was fired for questioning the government's statistics on the oil sector, noted last year that when an Iranian contractor takes longer to complete a project, it is dismissed as part of his developing expertise.    5. (C) Our business contacts observe that although private and even public companies are better managed and have more skilled and efficient work forces and practices than the IRGC, sanctions are hindering the private sector's competitive advantage by  DUBAI 00000302  002.2 OF 002   raising their operating costs and making them less competitive. An Iranian trader based in Dubai noted that he increasingly has to do business with IRGC-affiliated companies as the private sector is diminishing and that this has forced him to suppress his prices.    6. (C) Our contacts' anecdotes promote a perception that the IRGC is unassailable. A general manager of an oil engineering firm last month told IRPO that Iranians think that the IRGC gets any job it wants. He claimed that this was born out in Khatam's investment in the Iran Marine Industrial Company (SADRA), whose share price tripled after the 51 percent purchase this spring. The businessman asserts that this proves that there is a view that Khatam at least enjoys near immune status from the government. (Note: In March 2005, a consortium consisting of Khatam, SADRA and Norway's Aker Kvaerner won a bid for South Pars phases 15 and 16, but the Norwegian firm pulled out in May 2005. The phases subsequently went to SADRA and Khatam, despite objections from several Majles members who wanted to re-tender the project.)  Likewise, the Qom ayatollah overseeing the Fatemeh Shrine project viewed the IRGC's interference as a usurpation of his authority, but he told the software executive's friends that he could not push back against the IRGC.    COMMENT  --------------    7. (C) Ahmadinejad's populist-statist economic policies aim to redistribute wealth and the balance of power on economic decisionmaking. The anecdotes shared by IRPO contacts suggest the government believes the cession of projects to the IRGC is a means of accomplishing these goals and could explain why Ahmadinejad is so unapologetic in this regard, and why he can claim that giving the IRGC a bigger economic role is good for developing Iran's labor force. This almost patronage-like network is in effect shifting a portion of the economic balance of power and has contributed to some clerics' tensions with the government. The Qom ayatollah's inability to reverse the decision to shift projects under his patronage to the IRGC underscores the clergy's apparent reticence in challenging the IRGC and could indicate the potency of IRGC influence.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.(C) Summary: Despite claims of large numbers of foreign tourists visiting Iran, the actual number is well below the government figures.  Government restrictions, sanctions, and misperceptions of Iran deter tourists and make life difficult for Iranian tour operators trying to attract American and other foreign visitors.  Two Iranian tour operators and IRPO contacts who have recently traveled to Iran insisted that Iran has great potential as a tourist destination.  Our contacts were captivated by the hospitality offered by Iranians anxious to give foreign tourists a better perception of their country.  End Summary.    Few American Tourists  ----------------------    2.(C) Two Iranian tour operators told IRPO recently that the IRIG is notorious for inflating  the number of foreign visitors arriving in Iran.  Last year, Iran's Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts, and Tourism Organization (ICHHTO)announced that 2 million tourists had visited Iran, whereas the tour operators insisted the number was closer to 50,000 ("They must be using the same guy who counted Ahmadinejad's votes, " one of the tour managers joked).  Their firm brings between 100 to 200 Americans to Iran each year in two distinct tourist seasons: March through June and October through November.  According to the tour operators, although the government does not publish an official tally, 300 to 500 Americans visit Iran each year.  With such low numbers, Americans make up a small percentage of Iran's tourists.  The tour operators said that most of Iran's tourists are European, particularly German, Italian, and French.  There are also a great number of Japanese tourists, while Kuwaitis represent the largest group of Arab visitors, excluding Shia pilgrims from other Arab countries.    3.(C) The tour operators said that they preferred American clients over other nationalities, but that getting Americans to Iran involved negotiating the sanctions regime and the IRIG's own torturous visa process for American citizens.   Although technically legal, the tour operators said they find it nearly impossible to accept direct payment from American citizens because of banking sector sanctions.  Instead, their American customers must pay a friend who runs a tourism firm in Italy; the Tehran-based tour operators, in turn, withdraw an equivalent amount from the Italian firm's branch in Iran.  Balances are settled at the end of each year, in a system that the tour managers admitted "requires a great deal of trust."  The tour operators were very critical of certain sanctions, like the prohibition of the sale of airline parts, which they said unnecessarily jeopardized the lives of foreign tourists and Iranians, alike. (Note: The two tour managers had planned to travel to Yerevan on July 15 on the doomed Caspian Airlines plane that crashed in northwest Iran.  At the last minute, they changed their flight to come to Dubai.)  Attracting Americans was difficult as well.  The majority of their American customers are referred by a handful of U.S. travel agencies through word-of-mouth, and the tour operators said they had tried and failed to get a visa to the U.S. to attend trade and travel shows.    4.(C) American tourists wishing to travel to Iran must first either join a fixed tour group or submit their own travel itinerary to a tour operator.  After the agenda is approved by ICHHTO, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must approve the American tourists' visas, a requirement that is not imposed on any other nationality.  Once the MFA approves, it issues a visa number and authorizes a specific Iranian embassy or mission abroad, often the Iranian Interests Section in Washington, D.C., to process the visa.  The entire process takes no more than four weeks for Americans and the tour operators insisted that, in 12 years, they only knew of the MFA denying one or two tourist visas for Americans, whom they suspected were journalists attempting to evade Iran's long and complicated press credential process.  On arrival, American citizens, in addition to French citizens, must be fingerprinted.     DUBAI 00000305  002.2 OF 003   5. (C) Once in Iran, Americans can extend their visa for one to two weeks relatively easily; according to the tour operators, the MFA will typically approve the extension in three to four hours.  If an American wants to deviate from the pre-approved agenda, he or she must notify the ICHHTO and the MFA a day in advance.  Again, the tour operators could not recall an incident in which an Americans' agenda adjustment was not approved. (Note: Costs of a tour in Iran are relatively expensive.  The tour operators' standard daily rate for a single American traveler is about USD 400, including a guide and a driver.)    6.(C) All American tourists in Iran must be accompanied by a guide at all times, whom the ICHHTO selects from a pre-approved list.  The tour operators insisted that, despite rumors, these guides are not "government minders."  Most of them eschew politics and have no interest in collecting intelligence on American tourists.  According to the tour operators, they are proud of their country and enjoy "showing it off" to Americans. The tour operators did say, however, that these pre-approved guides are trusted by the government and have to file a report afterwards with the ICHHTO stating that the group encountered no problems while in Iran.  Nonetheless, the tour operators insisted that American tourists do not visit Iran "in a bubble."  Iranians love to discuss politics and the tour operators claimed that just by walking down the street American tourists are bound to hear many statements critical of the government. The tour managers even related a story of a guide who brought an American couple to a polling site in Tehran on the June 12 presidential elections and had the poll workers explain the voting process in great detail.    IRAN'S LASTING IMPRESSION  --------------------------    7.(C) IRPO contacts who recently visited Iran as tourists also said that their guides were not minders, and that they spoke freely, albeit privately, with Iranians they met about the situation in the country, both before and after the election. A Dubai-based American who traveled to Iran June 18 told us that he and his companion were usually left alone during the evening, and walked around Tehran and other cities unescorted, even while protests were on-going.  Another IRPO contact, an Asian diplomat, told us that when he was in Iran just prior to the elections, Iranians were eager to speak to him about their country.  He said his trip gave him a great appreciation for their hospitality and Iranian culture.  At the same time, he said, he believed that Iranians felt isolated and were sensitive to the negative image of the country that Ahmadinejad and others had created. Both our contacts said they saw few other foreign tourists, even in Tehran.  One contact said there was a notable presence of Chinese businessmen, however.    8. (C) The tour managers concluded that, considering current political realities, Iran has limited potential as a tourist destination. They complained that Iran lacks the infrastructure and high-end hotels that Western tourists expect.  The recent post-election crisis has only further hurt their business. According to the tour managers, the MFA placed a two-week freeze on tourist visas for citizens of the U.S. and EU after the outbreak of violence.  The tour operators were traveling with Americans during the demonstrations and were forced to adjust their itineraries in order to keep them out of Tehran, before booking them an earlier flight home.  Their firm has not brought any U.S. or UK citizens to Iran since the election.  With the Department's updated Travel Advisory, many American tour groups have cancelled planned trips to Iran through March 2010. Although their financial concerns are great, the tour operators, who said they have tried to use tourism to combat the negative images many in the world have of Iran, lamented the diplomatic opportunities that are lost when American tourism decreases. They said that Iranians and Americans share a cultural bond and natural friendship, and each American they have taken to Iran has been overwhelmed by the warm welcome he/she has received from Iranians.  They added that things would be much better for American citizens and Iran's tourism industry if a few U.S. diplomats were sent to man the Interests Section in Tehran rather than the Swiss, whom they saw as bureaucratic and not so  DUBAI 00000305  003.2 OF 003   helpful.    COMMENT  -------    9. (C) While USG-sponsored exchange groups traveling to Iran have experienced visa problems in the past, the tour operators' experience suggests that, for the majority of American citizens on private travel, the Iranian tourist visa process is a relatively painless one.  Although the tour managers, in the presence of USG officials, may have downplayed the significance of the government-appointed guide for American tourists, our contacts seemed to corroborate the tour operators' statements, at least for average tourists.  They shared the tour operators' view that expanded tourism could add to Americans' understanding of the Iran beyond the headlines and an appreciation for the friendliness of the Iranian people.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Week Ahead Holds Flashpoints for Unrest: July 30 is the fortieth day after the death of the demonstrators killed on June 20, including the now-iconic Neda Soltan, whose death was captured by cell phone video.  Fortieth day mourning services are traditional within Islam and provided critical momentum to the Iranian Revolution 30 years ago.   Although the Interior Ministry has denied Mousavi's request to hold a memorial service, crowds are still expected to gather to honor those killed. The IRIG has attempted to prevent public tributes to those killed during the unrest, setting the stage for additional clashes with security forces.  Next week brings Ahmadinejad's inauguration on August 5. Resentment towards Ahmadinejad from across the political spectrum has increased since the election, particularly after his efforts to install a protege as his First Vice President (see below).  Many Majles members have vowed not to attend the inauguration so the event may be a gauge for the government's unity.  There are also reports swirling around the internet of demonstrations planned for the day, again increasing the odds of conflict.    2. (S/NF) Insider Comments on Mashaei Controversy:  The Director of the Center for Interreligious Dialogue (please protect), which is part of the IRIG's Islamic Culture and Relations Organization, explained that conservatives' condemnation of Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaei's relatively moderate statement about Israelis and his attendance at controversial cultural events abroad mask the real reason behind their objection to him.  In truth, most Mashaei critics object to his purported belief in the imminent return of the "Imam Zaman" (Twelfth Imam) -- an interpretation viewed as "superstitious" by many, even staunchly conservative, Iranians.  Jokingly referring to Ahmadinejad as Mashaei's "marja" (source of emulation), he asserted that Mashaei has become a lightening rod for the clerical establishment's discomfort with Ahmadinejad's own well-known attachment to the Imam Zaman, which many clerics view as overstepping laymen's boundaries into matters of religious interpretation.  The CID Director, who was for many years a professor of religious philosophy at Tarbiat Modares University, noted that Mashaei's appointment to a senior role in Ahmadinejad's government in defiance of the wishes of senior clerics and conservative politicians - to include Supreme Leader Khamenei - has up-ended the establishment, which had tried to maintain a unified front since the election to rebuff the reformers' challenge.  Lines have blurred, he alleged, noting that "reformist conservatives" and "conservative reformists" are coalescing against Ahmadinejad in the wake of the controversy. Comment: With many across the political spectrum once again coalescing against Ahmadinejad, the critical unknown now is the degree of Khamenei's support for the oft-beleaguered President. Khamenei's support to Ahmadinejad was critical to the president's re-election but after having publically defied the Supreme Leader, their relationship may have frayed.    3. (S/NF) Mousavi Seeks TV Channel; Details of Ruholamini Death Accurate:  The head of Iran's National Academy of Medical Sciences (please protect), in Dubai for a visa interview, related details of a meeting he had with Mir Hossein Mousavi two weeks ago and provided insight into the beating death of Mohsen Ruholoamini, whose physician father is his colleague.  Comment: Our contact, a noted nephrologist who served as the Deputy Minister of Health during former President Rafsanjani's first term (1989-93), says that he maintains close ties with the Rafsanjani family and other key political figures, including Mousavi, whom he meets monthly in his capacity as the head of one of the four national academies in Iran. (Note: Mousavi is the head of the National Academy of Arts.  The other two national academies are for literature and science.)  Key points from our conversation:    -- Mousavi explained that he was creating a political "front" because he had been told he would not be permitted to establish a political party.  He said his top priority for the front would be to set up a television channel based outside of Iran that could broadcast the reformers' messages and uncensored news to viewers inside the country.  He emphasized that Mousavi insists the channel would not rely on foreign funding or content, but is a requirement for linking up with "average" Iranians, whose access to information is currently limited to state propaganda or the "agendas of outsiders."  DUBAI 00000306  002.2 OF 003      -- Our contact said that Mousavi and Khatami are working together "as brothers" and closely coordinating all statements and actions.  He suggested that though Karrubi's continued defiance of the election result was welcomed, he is not part of the inner circle of reformist leaders.    -- He described Abdolhossein Ruholamini, whose son's death in prison has led conservatives to open criticize the government's conduct, as a professional colleague whom he has known personally for decades.  Ruholamini, as the head of the Ministry of Health's Pasteur Institute, is well-regarded by other doctors, but has long been known for holding "extremely conservative " principlist political views.  Our contact believes the facts surrounding the story of his son Mohsen's death at the hands of security forces in Evin Prison to be consistent with what has been reported in the press.  He said Dr. Ruholamini, and his many close friends in the conservative establishment, were most outraged by the fact that officials at Evin were aware of Mohsen's family connections and yet still abused him and then allowed him to die of an infection. He observed the Ruholamini family's generational split on politics is common: the children of "many " known conservatives openly support Mousavi.    -- Our contact said that the consensus of the medical community in Tehran - of which he is the de facto head - is that about 150 people were killed in the unrest following the election, including people who died while in custody.    4. (S) Arab Journalist on Working in Iran and IRIG Suspicions of the US: An Arab television journalist who had covered the elections in Iran and their aftermath told us he left the country because it became impossible to work amid IRIG restrictions.  Our contact said he had interpreted the arrest of Roxanna Saberi as a warning to foreign correspondents prior to the election.  Her detention, and the subsequent arrests of others, had a chilling effect on many journalists, so that when the IRIG ordered them not to leave their offices while demonstrations were on going, few dared risk doing so.  He added that he believed all his communications were tapped, so that he felt cut off from sources and his network headquarters.  He finally left Tehran in frustration and is not sure if he will return.  He also told us that US efforts to avoid any appearance of involvement in the elections had been well received by officials in Iran during the campaigns.  Once protests began, however, deep-seated suspicions that the protests were part of a US plot became common among his IRIG contacts.  Comment:  Our contact said, echoing what others have told us, that the decision to clamp down on media coverage during the election aftermath had come from the IRGC, and the critical coverage of Iran's handling of the protests has only reinforced hard-liners' belief that foreign correspondents are conspiring against the IRIG.  The IRIG had succeeded in limiting information coming out of Iran, he said, so that in the absence of independent journalists, a clear picture of election fraud and the deaths of demonstrators may never be known.    5. (C) Iranian Ex-pat Recounts Efforts to Protect his Land in Iran: An Iranian businessman living in Dubai remarked that after the Revolution - he left prior to the Revolution - he has had to fend off repeated attempts by various officials to take his property.  Although he typically resorts to bribes, on one occasion he decided to personally defend his land - a pistachio farm in this case. As such he traveled to a courtroom in Kerman province after learning that an "endowment" in Iran had filed a claim for his property.  The judge was shocked to see him because the claim alleged our contact was dead.  After composing himself, the judge decided that resolving the issue would require a local investigation, to commence in three months.  Our contact participated in the local investigation, which entailed traveling with court officials to the town where his land is located and interviewing people about his land; the investigation did not resolve the case.  But that day our contact sat down with officials from the endowment and  DUBAI 00000306  003.2 OF 003   passionately explained the importance of the land to his family and himself, promising that he would never stop fighting for his land.  Shortly thereafter, the endowment abandoned its claim. Comment:  IRPO has heard from other ex-pat Iranians that protecting their land in Iran can be a full-time job; such absentee landowners clearly represent an easy target for unscrupulous officials.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Summary: A former Jewish MP said that at least one Jewish youth was among the hundred defendants subjected to the first show trial that began August 1 and the 18-year old has already made a videotaped confession to spying on behalf of Israel.  His arrest has sparked fears that more members of Iran's dwindling Jewish community could be dragged into the election dispute. The community was already living in a climate of fear instilled by Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel rhetoric and the threat of a military strike by Israel, which would leave the Iranian Jewish community extremely vulnerable to reprisals. Emigration rates have risen during the past two years because of the political tensions and he estimated the community has dwindled to 20,000 people, a significant drop from the widely-accepted estimate of 25,000.  The former MP, who maintains many contacts with well-known political figures, believes Mousavi won about 60 percent of the vote and that participation rates were exaggerated. His increasing concern that his community will be scapegoated as a result of the political infighting between conservatives and reformers is especially meaningful since many of the key figures he credits with providing "cover" for the Jewish community against radicals - including Khatami, Karrubi, and even Rafsanjani - are now themselves in a desperate struggle for their own political survival.  End summary.    Jewish Youth "Confesses" to Spying for Israel    2. (S/NF) Morris Motamed, a former two-term MP for Iran's Jewish community, told IRPO that four Jewish youths were arrested by Basij militiamen while participating in the June 20 street demonstrations in Tehran.  The four teenagers spent one night herded into a parking lot with dozens of other detained demonstrators.  According to their families, the whole group was badly beaten with batons and stun guns throughout the night before being moved to a police station, where the physical abuse continued.  Two of the young men were released after "two or three days" but the other two were transferred to Evin Prison and held 18 days.  According to Motamed, who said he maintains ties with many former and current IRIG officials from his days as an MP, the two young men were released after he spoke with Hossein Ali Amiri, who is the deputy to Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Shahroudi.  The two were re-arrested in their homes on July 18 by "IRGC security. " One of the boy's mothers told Motamed that in a phone call from her son, he said that a judge had told them the young men must prove that they were not at the demonstration that accompanied Rafsanjani's Friday prayer sermon on July 17. Motamed believes the families, who maintain their sons did not participate in additional demonstrations after their initial release from prison and have no links to Israel beyond their religion.    3. (S/NF) Motamed said that at least one of the young men picked up July 18, Yeghoutiel Shaoolian, was among the detainees prosecuted in the August 1 show trial. He said that Shaoolian's mother told him that at some point during his incarceration her son made a taped statement in which he confessed to spying for Israel.  Motamed believes that Shaoolian's confession may be linked to the testimony of the "unnamed spy" referenced in the six-part indictment released by the government in advance of the trial.  Motamed, who was an MP during the trial of the 13 Jewish Iranians arrested in 1999 in Shiraz and Esfahan on espionage charges, fears a repeat of that ordeal, which he says had far-reaching repercussions for Iran's Jewish community. (Note: Motamed said he became acquainted with Amiri, who is now Shahroudi's deputy, because Amiri was head of the judiciary in Shiraz in 1999 and played a key role in reducing sentences against the Jewish men, three of whom were originally sentenced to be hanged.)    Commenting on the Election    4. (S/NF) Motamed, while precluded from insider status due to his religion, nevertheless maintains a wide range of contacts developed during his service as an MP during the sixth and seventh Majles. He estimated participation in the election by  DUBAI 00000315  002.2 OF 003   Jewish Iranians to be only about 20 percent, which he characterized as typical.  A Mousavi supporter, he maintained that his candidate likely took about 60 percent of the vote. He believes Karrubi did respectably as well and may have come in second ahead of Ahmadinejad.  He said his wife volunteered for Karrubi's campaign and that the size of the candidate's volunteer staff alone was not much less than the number votes he received according to official figures. Motamed noted that the participation figure of 85 percent was likely inflated as well. He thought participation rates of 70 or even 75 percent, much like during Khatami's era, were much more plausible. Speculating on the potential ramifications of the elite infighting and the widespread popular discontent, he predicted that the government's days were numbered, but that political repression will worsen before the regime falls.  "Khamenei knows he's in danger, " he asserted. Motamed also argued that most of the Grand Ayatollahs - "the only clerics who matter anymore" - support Rafsanjani, and Khamenei now depends almost exclusively on the muscle of the Revolutionary Guards to maintain power.    5. (S/NF) Motamed said that during his terms in Parliament, he became the de facto interlocutor of the Jewish community for Iranian political figures, including Khatami and Karrubi, who still pay him courtesy calls to mark major Jewish holidays.  He last spoke to Khatami in April when the former president invited him to go on a trip to the United States in September. Motamed assumes the trip is now off but plans to ask Khatami personally in the near future.    Jewish Emigration on the Rise    6. (S/NF) Motamed said that the consensus of the community is that only about 20,000 Jews now remain in Iran and noted that emigration has increased over the past two years following President Ahmadinejad's increasingly strident rhetoric against Israel and his public questioning of the Holocaust. Though Jewish Iranians "continue to love Iran" they are being compelled to leave, mostly out of fear that they will become targets of a government backlash should Israel confront Iran militarily. Motamed said he lives in fear of an Israeli strike because the Jewish community has no ability to protect itself from what he believes would be a wide-scale attack on Jews and Jewish interests. He said that while economic opportunity and the chance to live somewhere as a "first-class citizen" do factor into decisions to leave, the uptick in departures is driven mostly by fear of the future.  Motamed noted that as a community leader, he has been asked for many years his opinion by Jews weighing their options.  Until two years ago, he told people they had to make the decision themselves. Now, he said, he recommends moving out of Iran to every Jew who asks his opinion. He estimated that 80 percent of Jews emigrate to the United States, while the rest relocate to Israel or Europe. (Note: Motamed's wife is emigrating to the U.S. and he is considering his options.)    7. (S/NF) Of the Jews left in Iran, Motamed said 11,000 to 12,000 live in Tehran, 6,000 in Shiraz, and about 1,500 in Esfahan, with the balance scattered over ten other smaller cities.  He noted that only eight rabbis remain in Iran, three of whom are based in Tehran, three in Shiraz, and two in Esfehan.  He said that training new rabbis is increasingly a problem as the rabbinical population dwindles.  Recently the "informal yeshiva" in Yazd closed and now there is only a small program run by the rabbis in Shiraz.  Motamed reported that the community's efforts to import rabbis have met only modest success, in the form of a London-based rabbi who recently visited Iran for a short period.  The IRIG rejected a proposal to have a rabbi from New York City make regular visits to Iran.    Comment    8. (S/NF) Motamed is a well-established IRPO contact who plays a unique role as a bridge between Iran's vulnerable Jewish  DUBAI 00000315  003.2 OF 003   minority and the Shia Muslim political establishment.  His increasing concern that his community will be scapegoated as a result of the political infighting between conservatives and reformers is especially meaningful since many of the key figures he credits with providing "cover" for the Jewish community against radicals - including Khatami, Karrubi, and even Rafsanjani - are now themselves in a desperate struggle for their own political survival.

DUBAI 00000316  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (U) This is a joint cable by the Iran Regional Presence Office and the Dubai Regional Media Hub.    2. (S/NF) Summary: Since Iran's June 12 presidential elections, Arab media have intensely focused their coverage on the demonstrations in Iran and the international community's response to the government crackdown.  Whereas in recent years the Arab media have limited their commentary to Iran's external relations -- particularly its regional ambitions and the international implications of its nuclear program -- during the post-election crisis Arab commentators have, for the first time, poked a hole in the veneer of the Islamic Republic's internal political system and explored its underpinnings more closely, often challenging the system's very legitimacy in on-air commentary.  A number of these commentators have opined that Ahmadinejad has, at least in the near term, lost standing among some moderate Arabs, who have come to view Ahmadinejad's administration as oppressive, unpopular, and undemocratic, much as they criticize many Arab governments.  However, all of the Arab media figures we spoke to emphasized that Arab criticism of Ahmadinejad has not necessarily led to increased support for U.S. policy in the region.  On the contrary, closer analysis suggests that Ahmadinejad's eroding popularity in the Arab world has created a scenario in which any U.S. effort to engage the current Iranian government will be perceived by a wide spectrum of Arabs as accommodation with Ahmadinejad.    ALL EYES ON IRAN  ----------------    3. (S/NF) Iran's post-election crisis has dominated the Arab media's news coverage for the past seven weeks.  The demonstrations have garnered special coverage on Al-Arabiya and have consistently been among the top headlines on Al-Jazeera. The marketing director of the Middle East Broadcasting Company (MBC), parent company of Al-Arabiya, told IRPO/DRMH that Al-Arabiya's viewership has skyrocketed since the June 12 election.  Al-Arabiya's news website has also experienced a dramatic increase in visits from users living in the region between Tripoli and Amman, which the marketing director, a native of Lebanon, attributed to the tremendous interest Sunni Arabs have in watching the drama in Iran unfold.  Coverage of Iran's election aftermath is not limited to straightforward news reporting; editorial pages, media commentaries, and the Arab blogosphere have also been abuzz with debate over the demonstrations, the international community's response, and the implications of these events for the Arab world.  While Iran's elections may no longer command daily headlines in the Western media, nearly all the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke recognized that the Arab street remains firmly focused on the recent unrest and continuing political drama playing out in Iran.    THE BENEVOLENT DICTATOR'S FALL FROM GRACE?  ------------------------------------------    4. (S/NF) A Syrian journalist and blogger, who owns a media consultancy firm in Dubai, believes that many in the Arab street initially viewed Ahmadinejad when he came to power in 2005 as a "benevolent dictator."  Citing the tradition of the Mahdi, the media consultant argued that both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs are taught from early childhood to await the arrival of a strong and unimpeachable figure who will lead the Muslim world.  The media consultant maintained that even secular Arabs view the world, albeit unintentionally, with this ingrained mindset.  Our contact argued that Ahmadinejad played in to this narrative, and when Ahmadinejad arrived on the international stage many Arabs saw him, in contrast to their own flawed leaders, as a humble and pious man who was brave enough to stand up for his people and the greater Muslim world by confronting Israel and the West head on.  However,  both the intensely competitive campaign period and the forceful reaction by the Iranian people to the official election results have led some moderate Arabs to rethink Ahmadinejad's  true disposition. The election, the media consultant said, led some Arabs to understand that despite his astutely crafted and well-marketed image in the Arab world,  DUBAI 00000316  002.2 OF 003   Ahmadinejad is resented by many Iranians for domestic mismanagement, incompetence, and corruption.  Because of this public fall from grace, so the media consultant told us, Ahmadinejad is no longer the "untouchable, holy figure" in the Arab world he once was -- his flaws have brought him down to the level of the Arab world's own imperfect leaders. An Al-Arabiya executive, speaking at a recent conference, said that the election aftermath had destroyed the image many Arabs had of the Islamic Revolution, and Ahmadinejad's legitimacy as a leader was now open to question. [NOTE: The media consultant attributed Iran's perceived "victories" over the U.S. and the West to Ahmadinejad, as opposed to Supreme Leader Khamenei.  While conventional wisdom in the West is that Khamenei has the final say over Iran's most vital interests, including the nuclear program, the consultant's comments suggest that the Arab street views Ahmadinejad as much more influential in the Islamic Republic's decision-making system.]    POST-ELECTION CRISIS NOT A SILVER BULLET FOR ARAB REGIMES  --------------------------------------------- ------------    5. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad's fall from grace notwithstanding, most of the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke agreed that Arab governments have a limited ability to capitalize on Ahmadinejad's missteps because of the skeletons in their own closets.   Al-Arabiya's former Tehran bureau chief observed that Arab regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who no doubt would like to exploit Ahmadinejad's current vulnerabilities, have remained noticeably silent.  In his view, they realize that any statement condemning Tehran's crackdown on peaceful dissidents would appear untenably hypocritical in the eyes of their own citizens.  He considers this public silence yet another "missed opportunity" for Arab leaders to take a stand to counter Ahmadinejad's rhetoric and further detract from his popularity with the Arab street.    NEW SPACE TO DISAGREE WITH AHMADINEJAD AND THE U.S.  --------------------------------------------- ------    6. (S/NF)  All of the Arab commentators and news media figures we spoke to agreed that the U.S. "played it right" throughout the post-election crisis by staying away from detailed public comments that could be perceived as interventionist.  However, the Arab commentators were quick to distinguish between criticism of Ahmadinejad in the Arab street and support for U.S. policies.  The Syrian media consultant said that the heated debates before the election, in which the three challengers -- Mousavi, Karroubi, and Reza'i -- publicly criticized Ahmadinejad for corruption and economic mismanagement, made it clear to Arabs that this election was about Iran, not the U.S.  This distinction, coupled with the U.S.' restraint in commenting on the election, provided an unprecedented window for Arab commentators to criticize Ahmadinejad without appearing to side with the U.S.    7. (S/NF) Examples of this played out during two separate appearances by the Dubai Regional Media Hub Acting Director on live panel discussions on Abu Dhabi TV and Lebanese New TV regarding regional issues, including events in Iran.  Whereas fellow Arab panelist resolutely disagreed with her comments in support of U.S. policy in the region, in particular the peace process, they felt free to openly criticize Ahmadinejad's government, which they refrained from doing in the past, for its internal crackdown and regional ambitions.  One Saudi commentator contrasted Turkish regional mediation, which he described as a positive force in the region, with Iranian regional intervention, which he called pernicious and destabilizing.  A Lebanese commentator noted the irony of Iran accusing outsiders of interfering in its internal affairs when there is not "one corner of the Arab world" where Iran does not intervene behind the scenes.    AHMADINEJAD DOWN BUT NOT OUT  DUBAI 00000316  003.2 OF 003    ----------------------------    8. (S/NF) As Al-Arabiya's Tehran bureau chief noted, while Ahmadinejad's image may have taken a hit in the Arab street as a result of the government's handling of domestic dissent, the damage is not necessarily permanent.  In his view, the Arab street is notoriously emotional and "could easily be turned to support Ahmadinejad once again" with some trumped up slogans and public bravado.  The bureau chief believed that, in the perceived leadership void left by Arab leaders on regional issues, Ahmadinejad could rally public opinion by capitalizing on any number of sensitive issues for the Arab street, most prominent among them Israel, at upcoming international fora. The Syrian media consultant, too, cautioned the U.S. not to overestimate any erosion in Ahmadinejad's popularity with Arabs.  In his opinion, Ahmadinejad has only lost standing with a segment of moderates in the Arab street; he believes that most Arabs are so polarized, either for or against Ahmadinejad, that the allegations of voter fraud and the violent post-election crackdown on protesters will not permanently sway their positions one way or the other.    ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN: NO PLEASING THE ARAB STREET  --------------------------------------------- ----    9. (S/NF) Comment:  Once the dust settles on Iran's post-election crisis, Arabs will look to see if the U.S. deals with Ahmadinejad as it pursues its nuclear nonproliferation agenda despite the lingering questions over the legitimacy of his election.  If the U.S. enters negotiations with Ahmadinejad's government, moderate Arab observers may argue that the U.S., for the sake of its own national interest, has cut a deal at the expense of pro-democracy advocates -- just as many in the Arab street believe the U.S. has done with a number of Arab regimes.  Those Arabs who continue to support Ahmadinejad, on the other hand, may perceive negotiations as a personal victory for a humble leader who brought the U.S. to its knees through steadfast resistance.  Thus, Ahmadinejad's "fall from grace" in the Arab world may have created yet another obstacle to improved Arab perceptions of the U.S. -- in which engagement with an Ahmadinejad-led government is now a potentially lose-lose scenario in which Arabs at both ends of the pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad spectrum will consider negotiations with Teheran an accommodation with the Iranian president.

A) IRPO 261      B. B) IRPO 285  DUBAI 00000317  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: As President Ahmadinejad enters his second term in office, his administration will likely be hamstrung by a strained budget, falling GDP growth, the global economic slowdown, and sanctions. Dealing with Iran's budget deficit currently is the government's main priority, though IRPO contacts also point out that growing unemployment and the struggling banking sector are also key challenges. Despite statements by government officials to the contrary, Iran's economy is experiencing a new phase of the global recession, and our contacts predict that the impact will become more obvious this fall as the commercial and financial sectors struggle to remain afloat.    Government Searching to Plug Budget Gap    2. (S) In light of last year's drop in crude oil prices, the IMF in January 2009 projected Iran's budget deficit could reach USD 12.5 billion by March 2010.  There are several indications that Ahmadinejad and the government recognize the extent of Iran's financial difficulties and are pursuing measures to address it. In late June 2009, the government reestablished the Money and Credit Council (MCC)-a group of ministers, MPs, technocrats, and Central Bank of Iran (CBI) officials tasked with formulating CBI policies and supervising monetary and banking programs. On July 12, the Majlis fast tracked legislation to cut public expenditures. The government on July 27 announced plans to merge the Commerce Ministry and Industry and Mines Ministry as well as combine the Ministries of Transportation and Communication. Ahmadinejad is also aiming to again tackle subsidy reform, which would free up a projected USD 20 billion if enacted. (Note: Iranian press projects that reducing select energy subsidies would add USD 8.5 billion in funds available to the government's budget. The Majlis committee charged with reviewing the plan on July 11 decided to allot the president 20 percent of this revenue for discretionary use, although the government and Majlis presidium have not reviewed this proposal.)    3. (S) An Iranian financial consultant in late June told IRPO that he viewed merging ministries as a positive step that could reduce administrative costs. He also considered Iran's release of new bonds, for example late June's USD 4 billion for underway development projects, perhaps as a way to finance capital spending outside the budget. Announcements revealing erosion in Iran's non-oil sector make it clear that despite officials' initial claims to the contrary, Iran will not be able to rely on its non-oil sector to substitute for decreased oil revenues, however. In March, the government claimed that it could make up for lower oil earnings through increasing tax revenues and non-oil exports, but Tehran's Taxation Organization announced in early June that it would cut taxes for industries hit by the financial crisis.    Slower GDP Growth Leading to Job Losses    4. (S) The government will have to contend with a slowdown in Iran's major industrial sectors, especially energy and manufacturing. The IMF projects that Iran's growth will decrease to 3.2 percent this year from 4.5 percent last year, a development that will reduce non-oil and tax revenue and perhaps has increased unemployment. (Note: The Statistical Center's latest unemployment figures show that between January and March 2009 unemployment rose to 12.5 percent from 11.9 percent during the same period last year.) A friend of a longstanding IRPO contact in Iran's business sector owns an Iran-based detergent factory that is struggling because the government owes it USD 25 million. The factory owner has reduced his payroll since last fall, but as of early July feared he may have to shut down.    5.(S) The government's ability to ease pressure on Iranians is being undermined by lower oil prices and a slowing economy. Many companies experiencing large losses in July requested government loans to pay justice shares, and Majlis members are questioning the feasibility of these payments in the current climate,  DUBAI 00000317  002.2 OF 002   according to Iranian press reports. (Note: Justice shares are shares from the profits of state-owned companies that Ahmadinejad championed during his 2005 presidential campaign. He began distributing these shares in 2006, which to date have gone mostly to Iran's poor, veterans, underprivileged, and some civil servants.)The government also is being pressed to provide loans to state-affiliated companies so that they can meet payroll, according to the managing director of an oil engineering firm who works with mostly Iranian government and government-affiliated oil and gas companies. He told IRPO in early July that he has experienced problems with these companies, some of which have not paid their employees in six months. Furthermore, many companies on Tehran's stock exchange (TSE) as of early July were also unable to pay their shareholders the profits they originally announced, creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the TSE, according to a newspaper associated with opposition leader and former presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi.    6. (S) Our contacts note that it is difficult to differentiate between the effects of the global recession, government policies, and sanctions. Nevertheless, they see currency devaluation as the key thing the government could do to dilute pressure on Iranian companies. Coupled with Iran's average inflation of 15 to 17 percent, an Iranian financial consultant speculates that the dollar-toman rate should be around 2000 tomans rather than 1000. The consultant and a factory owner maintain that Iran's artificially high toman is bankrupting local companies because they can not compete with cheaper foreign imports. Although the government last summer and fall flirted with currency reform, lower oil prices, falling inflation, and other factors are likely to turn the government off from pursuing it any time soon. Iran's former First Vice President Parviz Davoudi, an economist, best exemplifies the government's approach. On June 24 he ordered all economic-related ministries to avoid importing and advertising for foreign-made goods that were also manufactured domestically.    Skittish Banking Sector Cutting Finance    7. (S) Iran will need to prop up its banking sector amidst what our contacts described as a major crisis gripping Iran's financial and credit institutions intertwined with problems facing Iran's commercial sector (refs A and B). Central Bank Governor Bahmani announced in early July that outstanding debt to the Central Bank had risen from USD 33 billion to USD 38 billion since March. The general manager of a petroleum engineering company claimed that many of his customers -- typically government-affiliated companies -- cannot provide letters of credit (L/Cs) because they have too much debt. The contact said other options, such as bank guarantees, also have become less available as banks -- including those in Dubai -- reportedly consider these to be risky as businesses struggle to meet their bottom lines.    Comment    8. (S/NF) The debate over how to make up Iran's deficit may exacerbate differences between the legislative and executive branches; Ahmadinejad has sparred with the Majlis in the past and his rocky re-election probably has not earned him additional support.  However, Iran's budget problems and the ongoing effects of the global recession give Ahmadinejad more ammunition to again tackle Iran's subsidy system. Ahmadinejad's first attempt at subsidy reform failed, in part due to pre-election politics. Our contacts actually praised the subsidy reform plan and with the election now out of the way, Ahmadinejad may have more success. RICHARDSON 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000318  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/3/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: TRIAL INDICTMENT ALLEGES VAST CONSPIRACY AGAINST IRIG  DUBAI 00000318  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The August 1 trial of more than a hundred individuals arrested in the wake of the disputed presidential election continued the IRIG's efforts to re-assert control via repression.  In a sprawling indictment, the IRIG linked US and Iran-based NGOs, Israel, foreign media outlets, the MEK, human and labor rights activists such as Shirin Ebadi, and Iranian reformist figures, among others, in a vast conspiracy aimed at toppling the IRIG.  The trial highlighted the role that reformers supposedly played in such plots and sets the stage for their potential exclusion, writ large, from Iranian politics. If the IRIG fully bans reformers from the realm of legitimate competition, the government risks not only radicalizing an entire faction of influential political actors, but a large swath of the Iranian electorate as well. The trials are slated to continue August 7. End Summary.    Trial Renews Assault Against Reformers    2. (C) Iran on August 1 began a trial of more than a hundred political activists, journalists, commentators and alleged rioters in the country's Revolutionary Court system, where the government's hardliners typically mete out "justice" to dissidents and political opponents.  The prosecutor read a sprawling indictment linking US and Iran-based NGOs, Israel, foreign media, the MEK, human and labor rights activists and Iranian reformist figures, among others, in a vast conspiracy aimed at toppling the IRIG. Afterwards, high-profile defendants read confessions describing their roles in the plot and elaborate plans by the reformers to slander the June presidential election should their candidates not prevail. Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, a former First Vice President under Khatami and a senior advisor to Mehdi Karrubi's presidential campaign, alleged Rafsanjani and Khatami intended to use the election to take revenge against Supreme Leader Khamenei.  He stated that there was no fraud in the election, arguing that vote manipulation could not reasonably explain Ahmadinejad's victory by a margin of 11 million votes.    3. (C) The Islamic Republic has long used manufactured confessions and woven elaborate charges involving foreign hands to discredit both activists with political aspirations and apolitical critics of the ruling system. Public or written confessions frequently accompany trials and are often a pre-condition for the accused to leave prison.  This indictment also appears to represent the culmination of hardline fear mongering of a velvet revolution and the reformers' involvement in such schemes. The indictment is similar in both tone and substance to editorials appearing in Keyhan, a newspaper close to the Supreme Leader, accusations levied in state media, and the IRGC's public commentary over recent years. Abtahi's confession and particularly his assertion that the scale of Ahmadinejad's victory is prima facie evidence of the election's legitimacy echoes the argument the Supreme Leader made during Friday Prayers in June. As such, the accusations and public confessions are consistent with the IRIG's past practice.    4. (C) The scope of the accusations and the unprecedented number of defendants, however, suggests hardliners in the IRIG are upping the ante and likely using the trial as a means to bar reformers from the political playing field entirely.  Hardliners have for years sought to marginalize reformers since their heyday during Khatami's first term as president (1997-2001), using their control over candidate vetting and the election process to significantly reduce the number of reformers in office, and their power over the media to restrict reform-oriented journalists and publications.  Now hardliners are targeting key reformers and reformist bodies directly. Every prominent reformist organization is named in the indictment and many of those on trial hold key positions within these groups. The indictment sets the stage for Iran to ban these groups and exclude all reformers from politics; whether the government does so will be a key indicator of its intentions vis-a-vis the reformers. Such a step would be consistent with the IRIG's apparent decision to maintain power and defuse unrest by force of arms and repression rather than by offering concessions.    DUBAI 00000318  002.2 OF 002    5. (C) The indictment also included Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, who is currently in Europe. Ebadi has been under increased pressure from the IRIG in recent years; her human rights organization was shut down and a few of her employees are now under arrest.  Her inclusion in the indictment may be an effort to dissuade her from returning to Iran.  Other relatively well-known critics of the government located outside Iran were also named.    Reformers Denounce the Trial; Public Probably Not Convinced    6. (C) Rather than silencing dissent among key political figures, however, the first show trial has provoked unvarnished condemnation from Khatami, Mousavi, and Karrubi. The trial even elicited criticism from defeated conservative candidate Mohsen Rezai, who called on the government to forego additional trials and focus instead on punishing members of the security forces who attacked unarmed protestors.    7. (C) Predictably, contrived confessions and stage-managed trials seemingly carry little weight with mainstream Iranians beyond sympathy for the coercion endured by the defendants. IRPO contacts and reactions registered on blogs indicate that this trial is viewed as part and parcel of the fraud committed by the government to re-install Ahmadinejad as president and deflect blame away from the IRIG's leadership.  Speculation about the treatment of prisoners - to include allegations the government drugged defendants to make them more compliant - abounds.  Yet there also seems to be a current of disappointment in the defendants' willingness to publicly surrender.  Abtahi and Mohammad Atrianfar, another prominent reformer, in particular are the subject of tentative criticism by Iranians who did not expect them - in their capacity as long-standing key figures of the reform movement - to offer such believable and thorough confessions.    Comment:    8. (C) In setting the stage to potentially exclude all political actors sympathetic to the goals of the reform movement, the IRIG is substantially narrowing Iran's already modest political playing field.  If they fully ban reformers from the realm of legitimate competition, the government risks not only radicalizing an entire faction of influential political actors, but a large swath of the Iranian electorate.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000319  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/5/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ECON, EINV, ENRG, EPET, ETRD, SOCI, IR SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE DUBAI:WINDOW ON IRAN-AUGUST 5, 2009  DUBAI 00000319  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S) Endorsement, Inauguration Initiate Ahmadinejad's Second Term: Supreme Leader Khamenei officially endorsed Ahmadinejad for the presidency on August 3 and today Ahmadinejad took the oath of office during his inauguration.  Both events have been scrutinized for their clues to the elite infighting currently playing out in Iran. Many media outlets and commentators noted an awkward exchange between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad during the endorsement; whereas in 2005 Khamenei affectionately embraced Ahmadinejad, this year the Supreme Leader appeared to shun such an embrace, allowing Ahmadinejad only to kiss his shoulder. Additionally, a few IRPO contacts interpreted a passage in Khamenei's remarks as a warning -- Khamenei said the President would have his approval as long as he serves "progress and justice."  The Supreme Leader, however, made similar comments in endorsing Ahmadinejad's first term.  IRPO does not judge the endorsement ceremony to have clarified the relationship between the two, though it is notable that some Iranian observers consider the endorsement's proceeding to have signaled Khamenei's displeasure with Ahmadinejad.  Other points:    -- Mir Hossein Mousavi, former President Khatami and Expediency Council Chairman Rafsanjani did not attend either ceremony.  The Majles, where Ahmadinejad was inaugurated, was not full, suggesting that the members of parliament who had vowed to boycott the ceremony did so.    -- Khamenei's verbal sparring with Rafsanjani and the opposition continued. In a probable bid to rebut Rafsanjani's warning that Iran risked losing its republican nature, Khamenei during the endorsement ceremony argued that Iran's Islamic and republican identities could not be divorced from one another.  And following up on his own warning that the election aftermath represented a test for Iran's political elite, Khamenei said some of the elite had failed the test.  It is unclear if he was referring to the many standing trial already or others, such as Mousavi.    -- There were reports of protests during both events. Unconfirmed reports indicated security forces were out in force around the Parliament, nearby metros were closed and cell phone service blocked.  There were no immediate estimates of the size of the protests, although Twitter feeds claimed that bazaaris had closed their shops in solidarity and that protesters either had taken over the Tehran Bazaar police station or police there had joined the protesters.    -- In his inaugural address, Ahmadinejad said he planned to emphasize cultural values, family stability, economic reform, and an active foreign policy in his second term.  He expressed confidence that he would have the support of all branches of government and he invited the Iranian people, including elites and intellectuals, to join forces and unite in pursuing these goals.  In concluding, he claimed that he could feel the Twelfth Imam's divine presence  and announced that Iran is beginning a new age of the Revolution and a new chapter of humanity.    -- In reference to the international condemnation of the post-election crackdown, Ahmadinejad said that certain Western powers' refusal to congratulate his government proves that they only value democracy when it serves their own interests.  He further claimed that the outrage displayed by these "sworn enemies of human values" is a testament to the election's magnitude.  Although he said that Iran's enemies are trying to depict the Islamic Republic's future as bleak, the Iranian people are vigilant and know better.  Ahmadinejad maintained that his new administration will resist bullying powers, which must be held accountable for their interference and occupation. While he promised to support dialogue with all people and nations based on justice and friendship, he warned that the Islamic Republic will not tolerate insults, discrimination, or abuse.    2. (S) Fact Is Fiction and TV Reality: The IRIG's efforts to portray unrest as part of an intricate conspiracy of Western  DUBAI 00000319  002.2 OF 003   intelligence organizations, international NGOs, Israel, and their Iranian fellow travelers and its simultaneous silence on human rights abuses by security forces are further inflaming passions on both sides.  If the show trial is intended to offer "conclusive proof" of velvet revolution and build support for the government, then photos of bloody demonstrators and reports of families paying a "bullet fee" to reclaim bodies of the dead are evoking images of a brutal dictatorship come to power.  A Tehran journalist who supports the opposition told us that rumors and unconfirmed reports of Basij brutality are widely believed, and he cited as an example claims that protesters killed by security forces had been buried in unmarked mass graves are seen as fact within opposition circles.  At the same time, the Dubai bureau chief of a Western news service told us that although the service's Iranian reporters in Tehran are no longer being directly threatened as they were immediately after the election -- one was told by an anonymous caller his fingers would be cut off if he kept reporting "lies" -- they remain subject to restrictions on their ability to report on protests and other issues the IRIG does not want covered. Comment: The competition between the IRIG and the opposition for domestic and international public opinion is leaving little middle ground for objective, credible reporting.  Rather, the alternative perceptions of reality are appealing to emotions on both sides and likely hardening attitudes.    3. (S/NF) IRPO Contact Comments on Trial Indictment:  Our contact compared the indictment to those used during "Stalinist" courts and criticized it as inconsistent, full of legal mistakes, and outside the context of the Iranian legal system. He complained that many of the alleged crimes, such as taking pictures or working on a presidential candidate's staff, are not even crimes.  Our contact said he has worked for the two Iranian NGOs named in the indictment; neither of their directors, despite being included in the indictment, have been arrested. Summarizing, he maintained the indictment is a bid to convince the government's hardline supporters of the threat of a velvet revolution and a warning to the opposition.  Comment:  Our contact follows political matters in Iran closely and was living in Iran until recently.  As he is not a lawyer, his assessment is probably best viewed as reflection of the attitudes of intellectuals and the opposition rather than that of a legal expert.    4. (S) Iranian Energy Consultant Expects Appointment of IRGC Official as Oil Minister and Predicts Continued Industry Slowdown:  According to an Iran-based oil sector consultant, the rumor in Iran's energy industry is that Ahmadinejad will ask IRGC Commander Seyyed Ghasemi to serve as Minister of Oil in his second term.  Ghasemi currently oversees Khatam-ol-Anbia, the IRGC's industrial and engineering branch that has enjoyed a wealth of government contracts under the patronage of Ahmadinejad.  In reference to recent talk of U.S. sanctions on Iran's refined petroleum imports, the consultant doubted that Ahmadinejad's administration, already struggling with a large fiscal deficit, would be able to construct new refineries and upgrade older refining facilities in order to effectively shield Iran from a gasoline shortage.  The consultant claimed that the Iranian government had originally earmarked 4 billion USD for overhauling Bandar Abbas refinery ("the only refinery the government is serious about"), but financial problems forced the government to reduce the project's budget to 500 million USD, which even Chinese and local Iranian firms, widely known in the energy industry for "cutting corners," considered too low an offer.  The consultant maintained that, despite press statements by government officials to the contrary, the current financial situation in Iran has frozen most oil and gas projects, with the notable exception of the South Pars gas field.  When asked about the feasibility of a strike in Iran's energy sector, the consultant, who participated in the oil sector strike during the Islamic Revolution, said that with Iran's current levels of unemployment "any Iranian would kill for a job; no one can afford to risk their income in this financial environment."  He did claim, however, that a significant split is developing in Tehran's bazaar as small shop owners, whose sales have suffered during the post-election unrest, are growing resentful of the powerful bazaari backers of the Motalefeh Party, who have benefited economically from the party's ties to the government.    5. (S) Visa Applicants in Dubai Suggest Election's Economic  DUBAI 00000319  003.2 OF 003   Aftermath Uneven:  Several Iranian businessmen applying for visas in Dubai asserted that the election unrest had shaken the people's confidence in the country, causing people to hold on to their money.  A travel agent, for instance, said that immediately after the election bookings dropped 50 percent, though now bookings are beginning to increase again.  The construction sector, in trouble even before the election, also allegedly slowed further.  An owner of a construction firm in Mashad said prices for residential real estate there are down 50 percent from their highs.  However, some businessmen claimed to have seen little effect from the election.  A grocery store owner said people still have to eat in explaining why his own business remained unaffected.  An employee of a drug import company and an importer and manufacturer of textiles said sales remain pretty strong.    6. (S/NF) Former MP Recommends Publicizing USG Perspective on Civil Aviation Sanctions: A former two-term Majles representative of Iran's Jewish community said this his close friend Leon Davidian, who represented the Armenian community in the sixth Majles, was killed in the July 15 Caspian Air crash. Our contact relayed that the Iranian public generally holds "the West" responsible for the dismal safety record of the domestic air travel industry.  He said that in the wake of the crash, he gave an interview on Al-Alam network (the IRIG's Arabic language television channel that is broadcast externally) in which he slammed not only the "inhumane sanctions" but also the Iranian government for allowing domestic airline companies to cost save by using "the cheapest Russian planes available."  The former MP stated that few, if any, Iranians are aware that the IRIG is foregoing the opportunity to purchase quality spare parts through the waiver program.  He then asked why the U.S. Government was not making "better use" of VOA broadcasts to explain the United States' policies toward Iran, noting that the availability of aircraft spare parts was an issue we could "easily" turn against the IRIG just by publicizing "the truth." Comment:  Sanctions against Iran's civil aviation industry are a rare issue where the Iranian government's attempts to lay blame at the doorstep of the United States and our allies appear to be effective, even among IRPO's relatively worldly and affluent contacts who are typically well-versed in U.S. policy toward Iran.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: An Iranian woman from Shiraz seeking refugee status in the West spoke with IRPO regarding the IRIG harassment she faced after participating in post-election protests.  Her background made her a likely target for the IRIG; she is an English teacher, has friends in the US and UK, and participated in the State Department's Democracy video challenge.  Following her participation in the protests, IRIG security forces alleged she was the "main" organizer of the protests and would be arrested soon. In describing rumors-which she took as facts-regarding the security service's efforts to track and arrest protesters, she conveyed a sense for the climate of fear and intimidation the IRIG has created.  Her mindset also explains why the number of protesters has dwindled since the days immediately following the election: the government has scared many off the streets. Although some have suggested that Iranians' fear of the government is dissipating, that fear remains strong for some.    English Teacher, Facebook User and Democracy Advocate    2. (C) The refugee seeker is a 30-year-old single woman from Shiraz and was working as an English teacher and translator. Ahead of the election, she was an avid user of Facebook, which she accessed via anti-filter technology before the IRIG stopped blocking the site.  She mainly used Facebook to keep up with her friends, but she had written many harsh comments about the government on her page.  And to help her friends find her entry in the State Department's Democracy Video Challenge, she included a link the competition's Youtube page. She provided IRPO with the video's website address; the video is roughly three minutes, contains little dialogue, and seems to portray the futility of searching for democracy within Iran. The teacher is the main actress in the movie and her name appears in the movie's credits.    3. (C) She did not participate in the election because she did not want to sully her shenasname, or identity papers, with the official election stamp and because she did not the think the election, even had Mousavi won, would change Iran.  On her Facebook page she said she wrote that in Iran, "elections are like the rings of a chain and that the lord of the rings (i.e., the government) will win this game."    Participation in Post-election Protests Prompts Harassment    4. (C) Immediately following the election, the teacher joined her sister for protests at Eram Square, Shiraz. She described the protest as very large, but could not tell us the number of protesters.  She left without incident.  A few days later, while shopping, she was caught in another, ongoing protest.  A baton-wielding Basiji struck her legs as she tried to escape the crowd. She attended no other protests. Then, on July 1, she received an anonymous text message advising her to delete any incriminating evidence on her computer, including everything from her Facebook page.  Hoping the text was simply a friend's prank, she immediately called the text's sender.  The man who answered explained that he works for her internet provider and the Basij had been seeking information about her due to her online activity. (Comment:  The teacher consistently referred to her tormenters as the Basij, but the Basij's actual role in investigating and tracking down dissidents is unclear.) She proceeded to close her Facebook account, open a new, "clean" Facebook account, and delete items from her computer.    5. (C) A few days later she received an automated phone call asserting that she had been identified as one of the "main" organizers of the protests, that she had been seen at several protests, and that she would be arrested if seen at any more. Several of her friends received the same automated message, but unlike them, she received a subsequent, personal call.  She said the caller was extremely rude and said they had been monitoring her phone and that she had been in contact with people in the UK and the US and accused her of receiving suspicious text  DUBAI 00000327  002.2 OF 003   messages.  When she admitted to having received a bland text about an protest in Iran from the UK, her interlocutor immediately said that she had confessed and that they would be coming to arrest her soon.  She left Iran shortly thereafter.    Rumors and Arrests Heighten Climate of Fear    6. (C) In describing her circumstances, the teacher relayed other rumors and incidents-which she took as facts-that seem to have increased her fear that she was under surveillance and soon to be arrested. Among them, she said that her mobile phone displays the text IR_TCI on its screen but she had heard that when it is displayed without the underscore (i.e., IR TCI), the phone is "controlled, " or monitored, by the security forces. Because her phone lacked the underscore, she believed her phone was monitored.  Additionally, she was convinced that non-Iranian Arab speakers had attacked the dormitories of Shiraz University and arrested nearly 100 students, both male and female, though she had not seen them herself. (Comment: The presence of non-Iranians among the security services in Iran is an oft-repeated allegation.  IRPO is not aware of any compelling evidence to support these allegations, but the number of Iranians who believe the claim is notable.) She also asserted that none of her UK-based friends had sent her the text message regarding the Iranian protests and alleged that it must have been sent by the security forces in order to frame her.    7. (C) A friend of the teacher's had also been arrested-literally dragged out of her home-in late July, long after the friend had participated in any protests. She attributed her arrest to her prominence in one of the many mobile-phone videos of the protests circulating the internet. Continuing, she said the IRIG is reviewing these videos and arresting those they can identify. She passed along a website, www.gerdab.ir, where the government is asking for help identifying such individuals. (Note: IRPO was not able to access the website and verify these claims; however, a Google search for "gerdab " generates several websites with instructions on how to "take down " www.gerdab.ir because it is posting pictures of protesters and asking for help identifying them, supporting the teacher's story.)    8. (C) She had also been told of a friend's cousin who, on the day of a protest, had been arrested while going to therapy for a knee ailment.  While arrested, he was tortured with electric shocks and now-he has since been released-can no longer walk and has burn marks on his tongue.    Comment:    9. (C) We have received several inquiries about refugee status from Iranians who feel threatened because of their involvement in protests or other activities.  The teacher's story is credible and probably representative of the experience of many others in Iran.  She calmly described these events and was extremely appreciative for the opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, her background makes her a compelling target for the IRIG, given her contacts abroad, democracy video entry, and anti-government remarks. Her case highlights the tactics used by the government against its citizens to instill fear, particularly among those like the teacher, in order to prevent further protests. It is also notable that she is from Shiraz, not in Tehran at the center of the protests, and yet still experienced repeated harassment from the IRIG.  The rumors she conveyed-perhaps grounded in truth and perhaps not-reveal a measure of the personal fear and paranoia that the IRIG's tactics have created. Her mindset also explains why the number of protesters has dwindled since the days immediately following the election; the government has scared many off the streets. Although some have suggested that Iranians' fear of the government is dissipating, that fear remains strong for some.    DUBAI 00000327  003.2 OF 003    10. (C) The teacher was unsure of what she would do next. She feared returning to Iran, though it is unclear if the IRIG intends to follow through on its threats or if it merely intended to scare her into submission.  We referred her to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees office in Abu Dhabi, as we have done with similar cases that have approached us. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: An Iranian HIV/AIDS researcher in Dubai applying for a visa sat down with IRPO to discuss the HIV/AIDS situation in Iran. Less than 1 percent of the Iranian population is infected, though developing accurate statistics is difficult because the leading causes of HIV/AIDS in Iran, intravenous drug use and sexual conduct, are hidden from public view.  The Iranian government is supportive of HIV/AIDS research and efforts to prevent its spread, but focuses much more on preventing transmission via intravenous drug use and limits the ability of healthcare workers to address infection via sexual conduct. In general, the researcher supported the government's efforts but recognized that if HIV/AIDS in Iran becomes more prevalent, the government will need to do more. End summary.    2. (C) The researcher is an associate professor at Tehran University Medical School and is the research manager at the Iranian Research Center for HIV/AIDS, the IRIG's only such facility dedicated solely to HIV/AIDS research.    HIV/AIDS in Iran  -----------------    3. (C) According to the researcher, less than 1 percent of Iran's population is HIV/AIDS positive. (Comment: A 2008 UN report placed the number of cases in Iran in 2007 at between 67,000 and 110,000.) The researcher breaks the population into a high-risk segment and a low-risk segment.  Intravenous drug users and those with multiple sex partners constitute the high-risk cohort.  The low-risk group includes those that have low rates of intravenous drug use, such as mothers but also, surprisingly, truckers and sailors.  Generating an accurate picture of HIV/AIDS among the high-risk group is difficult because their risk factors (drug use and sex) is hidden from public view and as a result, the researcher uses infection rates among the low-risk group to gauge when HIV/AIDs in on the rise. Rates of HIV/AIDS are higher in urban areas, but the disease is also present in rural areas.  He blames the prevalence of HIV/AIDS on the country's social and economic mismanagement, suggesting that the political problems and chronic issues like unemployment make Iranian youth inclined to turn to drugs.    4. (C) Of those that have contracted HIV/AIDs, roughly 60 percent are intravenous drug users, a figure he said that is comparable to the rest of the world.  Government statistics attribute about 20 percent of HIV/AIDS to sexual contact and list another 20 percent as unknown, although he presumes that all of these latter cases also contracted HIV/AIDs via sexual contact. By his estimate, fewer than 5 percent of cases resulted from blood transfusions or via mother-infant transmission. (Note:  These numbers add up to over 100 percent; he was attempting to give his own rough estimates rather than provide precise numbers.)    IRIG Attitudes toward HIV/AIDS Prevention  -----------------------------------------    5. (C) The researcher described the government as very supportive of research into HIV/AIDS and efforts to prevent its spread.  However, as he elaborated, it became evident that the IRIG supports efforts to prevent infection via drug use but, due to religious sensitivities, is less willing to address the role of sexual contact. He claimed that Iran's HIV/AIDS drug addict research programs are some of the largest and most prominent in the world.  He commended government-sponsored programs in prisons, clinics, and health centers to move intravenous drug users to inhaled drugs. Many clinics, including his own, also give clean syringes to drug addicts and such programs are not at all controversial.    6. (C) Efforts to educate the public about HIV/AIDS transmission via sexual contact are constrained.  The government does not allow his research center to discuss the relationship between sexual contact and HIV/AIDS with high school students. And although a few health clinics are allowed to distribute condoms,  DUBAI 00000329  002.2 OF 002   they are only allowed to provide them to HIV/AIDS infected persons.  Politics also appears to play a role; the researcher said there was greater "space" to educate Iranians under former President Khatami than exists now with President Ahmadinejad. At the same time, the researcher expected that if the HIV/AIDS worsens in Iran, the government will adjust and allow more openness out of necessity.    Open to International HIV/AIDS Cooperation  ------------------------------------------    7. (C) The researcher said his center works closely with international programs, including the World Health Organization's (WHO) office in Iran and the UN Aids Iran office.  The WHO has plans to form an official partnership with his center in the future and to eventually make the center a "knowledge hub" and train other (presumably international) HIV/AIDS researchers there.  Currently, his research center is training and sharing knowledge with clinics and treatment centers in Afghanistan.  And exchanges and affiliations with U.S. institutions also exist. The researcher will be attending a research seminar this fall at UC San Francisco.    Comment  -------    8. (C) Iran's inability to fully address the spread of HIV/AIDS reflects the country's broader development challenges. Religious conservatism, as well other entrenched interests, limit the IRIG's range of available policy options -- in this case largely preventing healthcare workers from tackling one of the key drivers of new HIV/AIDS infections, sexual conduct. That said, our interlocutor was optimistic that if HIV/AIDS in Iran becomes worse, government policy would become more pragmatic. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S) Shahroudi's Term Approaches its End: An IRPO contact with indirect access to senior Iranian officials told us that Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi was leaving his office frustrated that he had been unable to make significant changes to strengthen Iran's justice system. Shahroudi will step down August 15 after 10 years in the post. Although Shahroudi is no reformer, he has maintained the independence of the judiciary, especially when the Ahmadinejad administration overstepped its bounds, and more recently in ordering release of many of those arrested in post-election protests.  Our contact told us that during a vigorous debate with one of Shahroudi's relatives over election fraud, Shahroudi's relative maintained that the election had been fair and in support of his argument disclosed that Shahroudi had even voted for Mousavi because of Ahmadinejad's reckless regard for the law.  Comment: Shahroudi has given no public indication that he has supported the opposition, but this anecdote does raise the possibility that Mousavi's unsuccessful efforts to find some judicial remedy to the election results indicated that the opposition saw Shahroudi as at least impartial, and perhaps even sympathetic to its claims.    2. (C) Contacts Paint Wide-ranging Election Day Picture:  Eight weeks after the election, IRPO contacts from Dubai and Iran unanimously maintain that Ahmadinejad benefitted from a rigged election, but we are no surer now of the scale of the fraud or its mechanism than we were on June 13.  We have not heard a consistent narrative about the election, nor any corroborating evidence that would conclusively support one version over another.  Some recount how many first-time voters turned out to oppose Ahmadinejad and claim Mousavi won nearly 60 percent of the vote while others, even participants in the post-election protests, believe Ahmadinejad actually won the election but by a much smaller margin than the official tally. We have heard both that the IRIG made up the ballot numbers on the spot after realizing Mousavi was winning and also that the fraud was an elaborate scheme initiated weeks in advance, with fake ballots filled out ahead of time, hidden in Pakistan to prevent their discovery, and flown back to Iran the night of the election to replace the real ballots. Given that our contacts generally reflect a narrow segment of the population, the rumors circulating among the broader population probably are even more fabulous and contradictory.  IRPO considers the wide-ranging theories notable for two reasons.  First, the various versions of the truth underscore the difficulty in ascertaining what actually happened during election day in large part because of the absence of independent Iranian media and restrictions immediately placed on the hundreds of  foreign reporters accredited to cover the elections.  And as long as this government is in power, it is unlikely we will ever get a complete account of what happened. Second, the failure of a consistent, compelling narrative to develop among those opposed to Ahmadinejad's re-election perhaps reflects the nature of the opposition itself.  The multitude of theories suggest the opposition movement is loosely organized and informed more by rumors spread by word of mouth and Twitter feeds.  Without a strong leadership that can make its case based on facts and focus its message to refute the government's elaborate conspiracies of Western interference, the opposition will continue to struggle in maximizing domestic and international support for its efforts.    3. (C) Election Changes View of Iranian Nuclear Program: A young Iranian woman from Shiraz in Dubai seeking refugee status in the West (see RPODubai 327 for a description of her situation) commented that like all Iranians, she supports her country's right to nuclear power.  However, she attached a notable caveat: she no longer trusts Iran's leadership to wield nuclear power responsibly and currently does not support the program.  She said that although her sentiments are unique, when she explains her argument to other Iranians, they now agree with her. Comment: Clearly, a woman seeking refugee status is biased against her government; her views should not be considered representative of the Iranian population writ large, as she said herself.  However, the fraudulent presidential election and the IRIG's violent repression of the post-election protests have diminished the government's legitimacy among significant chunks of the Iranian people, perhaps leaving many willing to reconsider their support for Iran's nuclear program.    4. (C) Professor Says Effects of Drought Still Lingering~: An  DUBAI 00000331  002.2 OF 002   assistant professor of climatology at Imam Khomeini University said that Iran's aquifers and rivers are still below what they should be after years of drought.  As a result, agriculture is still suffering.  His account is consistent with recent press reports regarding Iran's reduced water tables and rising beef prices due to the drought's effects on cattle herd sizes. Comment:  The professor is traveling to the US to research the effects of climate change on Iran's climate and the likelihood of more frequent droughts.  His trip, along with a recent exchange program on soil and water conservation for Iranian agriculture experts, suggest that irrigation and water management can be area of collaboration between American and Iranian scientists or the USG and IRIG directly as a means to build trust in non-political areas.    5. (C)~and Describes Importance of Western Research to Promotion:  He said that in order to become a full professor, it was necessary to spend a year doing research in a prominent Western university.  He rattled off several US universities that he deemed worthy and noted that some universities in the UK and Australia are also sufficient.  He said this list and the necessity of such time abroad was more an unwritten rule rather than official policy.  Imam Khomeini University, which is providing financial support while he is in the US, offers such research sabbaticals to faculty members as a reward for research.  The assistant professor described a point system based largely on written research by which faculty can earn the opportunity to do research abroad.  In contrast to some reports that Iranian academics need separate government authorization to do research abroad, the professor said that only approval from one's university is necessary.  Comment:  The system for research abroad creates incentives for Iranian professors to do ever more research and seems to be one area where Western influence and cooperation is welcome, at least as long as it fits the government's objectives in pushing Iran's level of science and technological development forward.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY.  On August 15 an anonymous open letter to the Assembly of Experts from "a group of seminary students in Qom, Mashhad and Esfahan," called for the removal of Supreme Leader Khamenei, claiming that he no longer met the qualifications for the position as stipulated by the Iranian Constitution.  The authenticity of the letter is currently unclear, as is the extent to which it represents a significant share of clerical thinking.   However what is clear is that due to the recent election and post-election crises, the 'red line' preventing discussion of the question of Supreme Leader's  performance is slowly eroding.  END SUMMARY.    2. (C) On August 15 an anonymous letter from "a group of seminary students in Qom, Mashhad and Esfahan," called for the removal of Supreme Leader Khamenei per Article 111 of the Iranian Constitution.  The 11-page letter, which has appeared Iranian expatriate opposition websites and not in any Iranian domestic press, was addressed to the Assembly of Experts (AOE), the body charged with selecting, supervising and if necessary removing the Supreme Leader.    3. (C) The letter's tone was unusually strident and accusatory, referring to Khamenei as either "Mr. Khamenei," or "Mr. (Ayatollah) Khamenei."  Highlights included the following charges:    - Imam Khomeini's purpose in creating the AOE was (inter alia) to allow the people to supervise the Religious Leader and to prevent a religious dictatorship.  But the Guardian Council (its member picked by and loyal to Khamenei) has politicized screening of AOE candidates to allow only Khamenei supporters, such that the AOE has abrogated its supervisory role and allowed a "khalifate and clerical monarchy" to emerge.    - "Mr. Khamenei" is the main official responsible for the current lack of confidence in the government, for the clashes, violence, imprisonments and killings, and he does not deserve to remain in office.    -  Khamenei has lost the qualifications cited in Articles 5 and 109 of the Constitution, and per Article 111 the AOE has the responsibility of removing him.  The AOE is responsible for the consequences of any delay in executing this duty which leads to a continuation of the current crisis.    4. (C) The letter focused both on the fraudulent elections and the subsequent crackdown, to include the current show-trails, stating at one point that "if they take Mr. Khamenei to one of these cells for only one week, he'd confess to a lot more than this [i.e. what the detainees have been forced to confess to].    5. (C) The letter follows another open letter on August 13 to AOE President Hashemi Rafsajani, this time from a minor reformist organization of former Majlis members.  It called on the AOE to fulfill its duty as per Article 111, the first part of which reads as follows:    "Whenever the Leader becomes incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties, or loses one of the qualifications mentioned in Articles 5 and 109, or it becomes known that he did not possess some of the qualifications initially, he will be dismissed.  The authority in this matter is vested with the experts specified in Article 108."    6. (C) COMMENT: The essential contradiction implicit in the phrase "Islamic Republic" is the source of much of the recent tensions.  Many, including "Green Movement" pro-Mousavi oppositionist, ascribe the government's legitimacy to the consent of the governed, given that the Leader is (indirectly) selected by the people, via their AOE representatives; the two letters reflect the opposition's efforts to assert the  DUBAI 00000334  002.2 OF 002   prominence of the people in determining the IRIG's legitimacy. Others, to include the intelligence-security coterie seeking to accumulate and consolidate power, insist that Khamenei's authority is essentially divine in his role as representative of the Twelfth Imam, and as such, challenging Khamenei is akin to challenging God.    7. (C) COMMENT (CONT):  It is currently not clear whether this letter is genuine and if so, how significant a strain of thinking it represents among Iran's clerical population.    A credible IRPO contact with strong ties to the "Green Movement" opposition claims that it is authentic, adding that "seminaries in Iran have been oppressed more than some segments of society especially since June 12 .. the crack is deepening quickly and you will see more letters and more discussions around the letters in the coming weeks."  If the preceding is true, it could reflect significant clerical discontent over the recent Presidential election, the subsequent crackdown, and more broadly the ongoing degradation of clerical status in Ahmadinejad's Iran.   However, over the course of his twenty-year tenure Khamenei has placed Iran's previously independent clerical infrastructure firmly under his control, as the institutions he controls determine who will study in theological seminaries, who quickly and how high they will advance, and how much money they will receive.  As such, it is likely that the clerical class as a whole will follow not lead public opinion.  Ultimately what this letter signifies is that at least certain parts of the opposition are not content merely to agitate for Ahmadinejad's removal, but are seeking to break through existing red lines and call into question the performance and authority of Khamenei himself.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  In a live August 16 televised address, President Ahmadinejad discussed the criteria for his cabinet selections and named six of the 21 ministers.  Of note is Ahmadinejad's candidate for the Ministry of Intelligence, Hojjat ol-Eslam Heydar Moslehi, who has ties to both Supreme Leader Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, and female selections for the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Welfare and Social Security.  The women, if approved by the Majlis, will be the Islamic Republic's first female ministers. The current ministers of Industry and Mines, Cooperatives, and Economic Affairs will remain in place. Ahmadinejad said he would forward his remaining nominations to the Majlis, and discuss his cabinet picks in another live broadcast, on Wednesday.  End Summary    Background on the New Nominees    2. (C) Hojjat ol-Eslam Heydar Moslehi, age unknown, is the proposed Minister of Intelligence.  Moslehi has ties to both Supreme Leader Khamenei and Ahmadinejad. He serves as Khamenei's representative to the IRGC ground forces and the Charity Organization and was previously the Supreme Leader's representative in the IRGC air force and Basij.  Moslehi was Ahmadinejad's advisor for clerical affairs, served on an Ahmadinejad committee intended to increase his government's interaction with clerics in Qom, and has also been active in politics on behalf of Ahmadinejad. According to Iranian press, he has accused Iran's reformers of being American stooges and reportedly described the September 11 attacks as an 'American Christian and Zionist plan to put pressure on Islam.'    3. (C) Dr. Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi, age 50, is the proposed Minister of Health.  Dr. Dastjerdi is currently an advisor to the President of Tehran University Medical School, manager of the medical school's international relations, and head of the medical school's branch at Kish Island. She was a Majlis deputy from Tehran in the fourth and fifth Majlis (1992-2000) and was rumored as a possible choice for Minister of Health in 2005. She served in health-related committees in the Majlis and previously worked in the Ministry of Health. She received a medical degree from Tehran University. We have not identified clear ties to Ahmadinejad.    4. (C) Fatima Ajorlu, age 43, is the proposed Minister for Welfare and Social Security.  She is the current Majlis deputy from Karaj and a long-time Ahmadinejad supporter, having served on his election committee in 2005. Her career in politics began in the Basij; prior to becoming a deputy she served as the head of various student Basij organizations.  She attained greater notoriety in 2008 after being interrogated by the Judiciary for her role in allegations of corruption against the Judiciary and several clerics.  She has a degree in psychology and is pursuing a doctorate in psychology.    5.(C) COMMENT: The selections of Moslehi and Ajorlu in particular are consistent with expectations that Ahmadinejad would name allies and those with ties to the Basij.  Moslehi's ties to the Supreme Leader also reflect the likely necessity that Ahmadinejad had to choose someone amenable to Khamenei as Intelligence Minister. We will be providing further analysis of Ahmadinejad's nominees as they are known.  EYRE

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.  (C) SUMMARY.  IRIG regime stalwarts showed up in force at an August 17 ceremony to greet the new head of the Judiciary Hojjatoleslam Sadegh Larijani (brother of Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani) and to bid farewell to the previous Judiciary head Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi.  This was the first time that President Ahmadinejad and Expediency Council Chairman Ayatollah Rafsanjani shared a stage since the early June commemoration of Ayatollah Khomeini's death.  Incoming Judiciary Head Hojjatoleslam Sadegh Larijani comes to the position with no substantive executive, management or judicial experience, and it seems likely Supreme Leader Khamenei picked him primarily for reasons of personal loyalty.  As such, it is unlikely that Sadegh will bring substantive changes or increasing order, professionalism and independence to Iran's corrupt and politicized Judiciary.  END SUMMARY.    2.  (C) IRIG regime stalwarts showed up in force at an August 17 morning ceremony to greet the new head of the Judiciary, Hojjatoleslam Sadegh Larijani and to bid farewell to the previous Judiciary head Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi (see Appendix for list of prominent attendees).   Most notably, this was the first time that President Ahmadinejad and Expediency Council Chairman Ayatollah Rafsanjani shared a stage since the early June commemoration of Ayatollah Khomeini's death,  held shortly after Ahmadinejad had publicly excoriated Rafsanjani for corruption in a televised debate with rival Presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi.  (COMMENT: While it is tempting to view the presence of Rafsanjani and others as an effort to demonstrate IRIG unity; it is more likely that the turnout reflects primarily obligatory  protocol and respect to the outgoing and incoming Judiciary chiefs.  END COMMENT).    3.  (U) At the ceremony most speakers in their public comments drew a link between establishing justice and respecting peoples' rights on the one hand and peace and security in society on the other.  In his speech incoming Judiciary head Sadegh Larijani vowed to maintain judicial independence and the impartial application of justice.  The line of his speech most quoted in Iranian press, and which drew significant applause from attendees, was that 'no one can presume to give himself the right to rule against the law and violate citizens' rights and deprive them of their peace and security.  These persons must know that sooner or later they will be called to judgment and the rights of the oppressed will be restored.  I announce here and now that I will not tolerate such actions from anybody and will entrust all violators to the machinery of justice.'    4.  (U) AHMADINEJAD VS. RAFSANJANI:  In his speech Ahmadinejad, in a reference that many took to refer to Rafsanjani, said that corruption, violations of peoples' rights, lawbreaking and people who create a culture of lawlessness in society must be dealt with and the holders of wealth and power must be called to justice.  In his speech, immediately after Ahmadinejad's, Rafsanjani did not respond to Ahmadinejad's comments but pointed out that if the people despair of their rights being respected, anarchy and lawlessness will increase in society.    5. (U) ATMOSPHERICS:   According to Iranian press accounts of the ceremony President Ahmadinejad showed up over one hour after the ceremony's start.    It was much observed in Iranian press that although Rafsanjani stood up as a sign of respect when Ahmadinejad arrived, Ahmadinejad (and Guardian Council head Jannati) departed the ceremony immediately after his speech and before Rafsanjani's speech.  When Rafsanjani arrived, the audience greeted him loudly.    PERFORMANCE EVALUATION    6.  (C) OUTGOING -- SHAHROUDI: It was also announced on August 17 that similar to his predecessor Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, Supreme Leader Khamenei has appointed departing Judiciary Head Ayatollah Shahroudi to be a member of the Guardian Council, the entity charged with vetting Majlis legislation and also supervising elections.  Also like his predecessor, Shahroudi came to the position as Judiciary head at a time of tumult,  DUBAI 00000340  002.2 OF 003   shortly after the 1999 Tehran University riots.   At the start of his tenure, Shahroudi famously compared the Judiciary to "ruins" which he sought to restore, and the general consensus seems to be that he indeed was marginally better than his predecessor, hardline cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi.  Among Shahroudi's achievements was restoring the position of public prosecutor, removed in 1994 in an attempt to mimic early Islamic court structures where the judge was the sole judicial official.  Shahroudi also sought to minimize incarnation for offenses and to refer cases to "dispute resolution councils" instead of court.  He also tried to 'de-Islamicize' punishments, to include stopping the practice of stoning women, and he also accepted certain forms of legal equality for women and minorities.    7.  (C) Shahroudi also sought to bring some type of order and modernization to the Judiciary, but it remained a vast, unwieldy and corrupt bureaucracy riddled with individual fiefdoms, where, in the words of one IRPO contact, 'justice was sold by the kilo.'  Notably, he had little control over the hardline conservative Saeed Mortazavi, Tehran's Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor General, who spearheads the judicial anti-reformists.  Shahroudi also consistently allowed political arrests and the closing scores of reformist newspapers, and he seemingly exercised no control over handling of political prisoners in Iran's prisons.    8. (C) INCOMING -- LARIJANI: As for incoming Judiciary head Hojjatoleslam Larijani, it seems that his most salient characteristic besides his loyalty to Khamenei  is his youth and inexperience   (COMMENT: In the decree naming him as Judicial head, Supreme Leader Khamenei accurately refers to his clerical status as 'Hojjatoleslam,' but Iranian media has granted him the greater title of 'Ayatollah.'  It seems likely that Khamenei did not use the higher rank in order to avoid further alienating his clerical base. END COMMENT) Sadegh was born in 1960 in Najaf, Iraq to prominent Grand Ayatollah and Source of Emulation Haj Mirza Hashem Amoli, one of the major 'Sources of Emulation' in Najaf and Qom.  He comes to this position as the youngest Judiciary head.    9. (C) Supreme Leader Khamenei appointed him to the Guardian Council in 2001, where he has served for the last eight years. Other than serving on the Guardian Council, he has had no full-time government experience, and a common criticism of his selection is that he has no executive or management experience that qualifies him to head a complex organization with over 160,000 employees, nearly nine million annual cases of litigation and thousands of people in jail.  As such, Iranian press has speculated that he will bring much expertise over from the Guardian Council to the Judiciary to assist him.    10. (C) Like his other four brothers, Sadegh has no revolutionary credentials whatsoever, although his official biography posted on his website says that at the time of the Revolution he 'realized that the West's cultural threat was no less than that of its military threat,' and as such he focused on studying  (and presumably countering) Western philosophical thought.  Before the Revolution he was slated to study abroad under a scholarship, but at the last minute for reasons he has not mentioned he decided to enter seminary  (COMMENT: In talking about Sadegh Many IRPO interlocutors have repeated a well-known statement reportedly said by Khomeini that to the effect that none of the Larijani brothers were trustworthy.  END COMMENT).    11. (C) COMMENT:  Some Western press has speculated Supreme Leader Khamenei will use the 'Kennedy-esque' Larijani family as a counter-weight to Ahmadinejad.  This is too simple an explanation, as family relations do not equate to identical ideological orientations.  For example, Supreme Leader Khamenei's brother Hadi is an ardent reformist; of the two Ayatollah Sanei brothers, one is the head of the 15 Khordad Foundation that put a price on Salmon Rushdie's head, the other is a progressive cleric who believes in full equality for women.  Even within the Larijani family, Majlis Speaker Ali is firmly opposed to Ahmadinejad while his brother Mohammad Javad is an equally fervent supporter of the President.  As such, it is impossible to use his family as a guide to his attitude toward  DUBAI 00000340  003.2 OF 003   Ahmadinejad. What does seem clear is that Khamenei picked Sadegh not for any expertise or experience, but for reasons of personal loyalty, a criterion that has guided most if not all of Khamenei's personnel decisions.  As such, it is unlikely that Sadegh will bring substantive changes or increasing order, professionalism and independence to Iran's corrupt and politicized Judiciary, and it is unclear whether he will use his position to hinder Ahmadinejad's agenda.    Similarly, analysis indicating that Sadegh's appointment bespeaks a 'militarization' of the Judiciary, based on Sadegh's previous involvement teaching at IRGC facilities, is equally simplistic.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Ahmadinejad delivered the names of 18 of his 21 proposed cabinet ministers to the Majlis today.  The remaining three-for the ministries of defense, commerce, and justice-had not yet been finalized, although legally today is the deadline for such a submission. Of note, the incumbent Foreign Affairs Minister, Manuchehr Mottaki, was nominated to retain his post, Ahmadinejad nominated a third female to the cabinet, and the Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar has been nominated for the Interior Ministry. It is expected that many of Ahmadinejad's picks will undergo a thorough if not brutal examination by the Majlis if for no other reason than the fact that, in contrast to previous administrations, the President made no effort to consult with the Majlis on his selections. The background for selected Ministerial nominees follows.    2. (U) Foreign Affairs:  Manuchehr Mottaki.  Mottaki has served in this position since 2005. There was speculation that Ahmadinejad would replace Mottaki with his ally, current head of the Supreme Council for National Security Saeed Jalili.  Mottaki has been criticized during his tenure for being weak and ineffective. He is a career diplomat.    3. (U) Interior: Mostafa Mohammad Najjar.  Najjar has served as the Minister of Defense since 2005.  He has served in the IRGC in a variety of positions since 1979.    4. (C) Intelligence: Hojjatoleslam Heydar Moslehi.  Ahmadinejad announced this appointment on Sunday. (NOTE: One IRPO contact, a former high ranking IRGC officer who knew Moslehi when the latter worked as the Supreme Leader's representative to the IRGC ground forces was surprised at Moslehi's appointment, saying that Moslehi did not have much of an intelligence background. He characterized Moslehi as `soft spoken' and `rational', at least in relation to many of the IRGC intelligence officers who play an increasing role in the government.)    5. (U) Islamic Culture and Guidance: Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni. Hoseyni is a professor of theology at Tehran University, executive deputy at IRIB, and served in the Majlis from 1996-2000.    6. (U) Economic Affairs and Finance: Shamseddin Hoseyni. Hoseyni is the incumbent at the ministry, serving there since 2008. He received 218 votes last year, suggesting his re-confirmation is likely. He is a critic of Iran's subsidy system and will presumably work with Ahmadinejad for its reform.    7. (U) Oil: Seyyed Masud Mirkazemi.  Mirkazemi was the Commerce Minister during Ahmadinejad's first term.  High inflation prompted some calls for his impeachment in May 2008, though he remained in office.  A biography published on Ahmadinejad's website in 2007 shows little background in the oil industry; prior to becoming Commerce Minister, he served in various positions in the Defense Ministry.  He has a Phd in industrial engineering.    8. (U) Energy: Mohammad Ali-Abadi.  Ali-Abadi served as the Vice President for Physical Education during Ahmadinejad's first term and also headed Iran's Olympic Committee.  He came under criticism for politicizing Iranian sports.  He was a deputy at the Tehran Municipality during Ahmadinejad's time as mayor.  He has a Master's degree in architecture.    9. (U) Education: Susan Keshavarz. Keshavarz is the third female Ahmadinejad has nominated to his cabinet.  Keshavarz joined the Education Ministry in 2008 as a deputy, heading the Special Education Organization.  She was previously a professor of philosophy.  A Majles deputy criticized her prospective nomination because she lacks executive experience.  DUBAI 00000341  002.2 OF 002      10. (C) Comment: The cabinet nominees include incumbents, those having served elsewhere in Ahmadinejad's first term, and new faces.  As expected, some of Ahmadinejad's selections seem to lack experience in their designated posts. Prior to the cabinet announcement there had been extensive grumblings among Majlis deputies (and other political elites) that Ahmadinejad had failed to consult them on his selections, setting up a contentious battle for some of his nominations.  IRPO will follow-up with a more comprehensive assessment of the nominees. EYRE 
C O N F I D E N T I A L RPO DUBAI 000347  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/24/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: RAFSANJANI'S COMMENTS RE: KHAMENEI: RECAPITULATION NOT CAPITULATION  CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY:  The August 23 comments by Expediency Council President Ayatollah Rafsanjani in which he urged fealty to Supreme Leader Khamenei, was not so much a capitulation to the Supreme Leader as it was a rhetorical dressing of his more substantive comments, in which he continued to call for return to the rule of law and civil treatment of the opposition.  END SUMMARY.    2. (C) On August 23 Expediency Council (EC)  President Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani opened a meeting of this body by calling for national unity, and urging  adherence to the guidance of Supreme Leader Khamenei.   Some internal  Iranian conservative media associated with President Ahmadinejad (Fars News for instance) highlighted those aspects of his comments urging obedience to the Supreme Leader, and much Western press characterized this speech as Rafsanjani 'changing his political position,' in recommending a policy of submission to the Supreme Leader's dictates.  For example, AFP's August 23 story title was "Switching Gears, Cleric Rafsanjani Urges Support for Supreme Leader."    3.  (C) However, a fuller reading of Rafsanjani's comments indicate that his position on recent events has not changed, as he said "to deal with the current situation ~ everyone must follow the Supreme Leader's guidelines, abide by the Constitution, and obey the law.  Lawbreakers must be dealt with properly, the current emotional atmosphere must be replaced with a rational one, freedom of speech must be allowed, and suitable responses must be made to constructive criticism.  He also said that 'justice must be served in the cases of those who were arrested in the post-election unrest."    4. (C) IRPO contacts have also interpreted this speech as a continuation of, vice deviation from, Rafsanjani's post-election line.  As a European-based Iran analyst told IRPO, "one shouldn't listen to the first line, which is always that Khamenei is of course our Leader and we should listen to him. What is important is what comes afterwards.  Since his Friday Prayer speech Rafsanjani has consistently called for better treatment of the opposition on TV and radio and creating an atmosphere for positive criticism, redressing the violations that have occurred, and responding more rationally (and less violently) to critics.  All of these concerns were in this latest speech.   As far as I am concerned Hashemi is still a thorn, giving the coverage necessary for the continued activities of Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami."  Another IRPO contact, a former Majlis representative, pointed out that Rafsanjani is a true pragmatist and  far more politically astute than Supreme Leader Khamenei.  As such, he is seeking to walk a fine line between opposing a Khamenei-Ahmadinejad alliance he sees as destructive to the regime on the one hand while also seeking to preserve the current structure of the regime, since the source of his power is inextricably intertwined with the status quo.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000348  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/24/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: IN CABINET AHMADINEJAD CHOOSES LOYALTY AND IDEOLOGY OVER EXPERIENCE  DUBAI 00000348  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.  (C) SUMMARY: President Ahmadinejad's nominees for his second-term cabinet showcase his preference for loyalty over expertise, as most clearly have longstanding ties to the President.  Although most of the 21 these nominees generally lack significant experience for their respective ministries, Ahmadinejad seems to have positioned several nominees for their current promotion by installing them as deputy ministers over the past few years in their designated fields. Also noteworthy are the IRGC ties of nominees for the key Defense, Intelligence, and Interior Ministries.  These 'power ministry' nominations probably reflect the increasing role of the IRGC in internal security, however, media depictions of a cabinet slate 'dominated' by the IRGC overstates the case, as most of the 21 nominees do not have such ties.  The Majlis is now reviewing the nominees and has complained many nominees lack experience and more generally that Ahmadinejad failed to consult with the Majlis prior to announcing his nominations. A few nominees probably will not be approved, although the Majlis could well feel pressure from Supreme Leader Khamenei to avoid embarrassing Ahmadinejad (and weakening the executive branch) at a time when Iran feels under severe international scrutiny. Votes on the nominees are scheduled to begin next week. END SUMMARY.    Cabinet Nominees Loyal to Ahmadinejad    2.  (C) In two live television interviews Ahmadinejad introduced his cabinet selections and the criteria for their selection.  In addition to promoting their putative professional qualifications, Ahmadinejad made clear that their support for his agenda was a key component for the nominees' selection. Toward this end, many Iran observers have noted that all former cabinet members who objected to his thwarted promotion of ally Rahim Esfandiar Mashaie to First Vice President were not retained.  In their place, Ahmadinejad has nominated mostly individuals to which he has longstanding ties. Some have ties to Ahmadinejad from his time as Tehran Mayor, were appointed by Ahmadinejad as Governor Generals or deputy ministers, have vocally supported the President over the past few years, and/or have assisted in his election campaigns.    3.  (C) Although some nominees do have an IRGC background, they do not dominate the proposed slate.  Defense Ministry nominee Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi has served in a variety of IRGC roles, most notably in the Qods Force, and Intelligence Minister nominee Heydar Moslehi and Interior Ministry nominee Mostafa Mohammad Najjar share an IRGC pedigree.  These are critical ministries and the nominations probably do reflect the increasing role of the IRGC in internal security. However, most of the other nominees have not had prominent positions with the IRGC or Basij.  As such, media analysis characterizing the proposed cabinet as indicative of an 'IRGC takeover' probably overstates the case - rather, the nominees' ideologically affinity with and loyalty to Ahmadinejad and not their ties the IRGC or Basij appear to be a more important factor in their selections. In contrast to an increase in IRGC affiliation, Ahmadinejad nominated the minimum number of clerics possible: one (NOTE: Iran's law requires that the Intelligence Minister be a cleric.  This low number of clerics could well reflect Ahmadinejad's disregard for the clerical class as a whole.)    4.  (C) Knowledgeable observers inside and outside Iran have also faulted Ahmadinejad for his nominees' dearth of relevant experience.  In particular, the nominee for the Oil Ministry Seyyed Masud Mirkazemi has been singled out.  Mirkazemi is the current Commerce Minister, has strong ties to the IRGC and involvement in defense and logistics planning, but has no apparent background in the oil industry. Other nominees seem similarly ill-suited to their positions, though Ahmadinejad perhaps has tried to undercut such arguments by naming several deputy ministers to head the organization they now serve.  The proposed Ministers of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, and Communications and Information Technology fall into this category but have only limited experience. Although five of the nominees are incumbents, only one, Foreign Affairs Minister Mottaki was an original member of Ahmadinejad's 2005 cabinet. The others were installed between 2006 and 2008, often with minimal prior experience.  DUBAI 00000348  002.2 OF 002      Reactions to the Nominees    5.  (C) Ahead of Ahmadinejad's announcement of the nominees, Majlis members complained about the President's lack of coordination, and seemed eager to voice their frustration by immediately criticizing several of the picks. A Majlis Deputy Speaker even predicted that "at least four or five" of the nominees would not be approved.  The prediction makes sense given that in 2005 four of Ahmadinejad's picks were rejected by the Majlis and a few of his ministers were subsequently impeached during their tenures (Comment: Prior to Ahmadinejad it was it was rare for cabinet nominees to fail to win Majlis approval at the start of a Presidential term). At the same time, an IRPO contact with former Majlis experience cautioned against taking the current Majlis grumblings over the nominees too seriously, suggesting that the Majlis decisions on the nominees are typically made at the last minute as a result of behind-the-scenes horsetrading.  Also, several previous Ahmadinejad nominees initially criticized for lack of executive or managerial experience have ultimately prevailed, eventually earning the Majlis' vote of confidence.    6.  (C) Other Majlis members, taking their cue from some senior clerics, have questioned Ahmadinejad's nomination of three women as ministers of Education, Health, and Welfare.  A member of the Majlis clerical faction said that two Grand Ayatollahs had concerns regarding the suitability of females to serve as ministers. Additionally, some Friday Prayer leaders last week attacked Ahmadinejad for his selection of the women. The relevant experience of the women has also been questioned, and as such, Majlis votes against the three may reflect concerns about their lack of experience as much as concerns about their gender.    7.  (C) The international reaction to Brigadier General Vahidi's nomination to the Defense Ministry-due to the Interpol arrest warrant for his role in the bombings in Argentina in 1994-will probably have little consequence.  A Majlis deputy remarked that the international outcry only made Vahidi's confirmation all the more likely.  It is quite possible that the nominee for the Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology could also have trouble traveling abroad.  In a March 2008 interview, nominee Kamran Daneshju said he had been barred from entering the European Union due to his deportation from the UK while a student during the Salman Rushdie affair.    8. (C) COMMENT: Although several of the nominees will be thoroughly roughed up in the process and a few even possibly rejected, the Majlis will also feel pressure from certain quarters to approve the nominees and, in the case of the key ministries, the nominees are probably pre-approved by Khamenei. An August 23 lead editorial in the IRGC official "Sobhe Sadegh" weekly newspaper, for instance, suggested that the Majlis err on the side of goodwill when deliberating on the nominees in order to avoid 'playing into the enemy's hands.'  Quite likely Supreme Leader Khamenei, in the wake of the popular unrest and dissension among the elite, prefers that these hearings not become a platform to vent Majlis frustration with Ahmadinejad.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The inclusion of USG public diplomacy programs and IRPO in a recent indictment read during the second show trial in Tehran is not a new allegation of US plotting for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.  Such claims have been made before, most recently in January, and contain many accurate details about the programs, but leap wildly to conclusions of intrigue and far-ranging conspiracies.  IRIG responses to our exchange programs have varied, from tacit acceptance to obstruction to arrests and intimidation of participants.  In the current climate, the inclusion of US programming in a laundry list of the "usual suspects" is not surprising, but it may reflect heightened suspicions of an embattled leadership.  With the situation in Iran so unsettled, we believe it would be prudent for IRPO to delay any pending exchange programs until there are clearer indications of IRIG intentions toward the programs and the participants.  End Summary.    2. (C) On August 15, Iran's Revolutionary Court held the second trial of defendants arrested following street protests over the results of the presidential election.  Prosecutors read a 22-page indictment that described a far-flung conspiracy among domestic opposition groups and foreign governments.  Included in the indictment were direct references to the USG, the Iran Regional Presence Office and its officers, VOA, and several NGOs that have worked with the Department.  (Note:  A copy has been e-mailed to NEA/IR.)    Round up the Usual Suspects  -----------------------------    3.  (C) The indictment alleged, among other things, that Western powers had sought soft overthrow in the guise of public diplomacy because wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in conjunction with Iran's military power had made the military overthrow of the IRIG impossible.  Public diplomacy and by extension "soft overthrow" sought to influence attitudes of the Iranian public toward their government and impose Western values to bring down the IRIG.  Although the indictment accurately described public diplomacy and many of its functions, prosecutors went further in alleging that the aims of the US public diplomacy program was to create and broaden rifts between the people and IRIG, to pressure the Iranian government to change its behavior and to portray America "as Iran's only savior."  Participants in US programs were also intended as sources of information, analyses and intelligence about Iran, according to the indictment. (Note:  The indictment also devoted considerable attention to the British Council, the British Embassy in Tehran and BBC Persian, even more than was directed at us.)    4. (C) The indictment specifically mentioned IRPO, two previous IRPO directors and IRPO's current deputy director.  IRPO is "modeled on the Riga [station]" which was set up to engineer the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to the indictment, and its goals in Dubai are to attract the Iranian elite and convince them to act against the interests of the Islamic Republic.  In a description of the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) run by IRPO, which included details on visa processing and logistical arrangements, the indictment noted that participants had returned "impressed" by their trips to the US and often volunteered to help with future exchange groups. Iranian authorities also seemed to have conflated public diplomacy programs with separate democracy programming in describing US regime overthrow efforts and referred to other Iran Watcher posts'  in London, Baku and Istanbul as being involved in these programs.  Additionally, Iranian authorities cited VOA, the Department's Digitial Outreach Team, as well as NGO's Meridian House International, the Aspen Institute and Freedom House as having some part in trying to undermine the Islamic Republic.    5.  (C) The IRIG has accused IRPO of being the instrument of regime change before.  Semi-official and IRGC-affiliated Fars News published an interview with an unnamed counterintelligence official in January that was nearly identical to the details in the indictment.  These details have most likely been gleaned IVLP participants, who have either provided them in seeking permission from their employers to participate, and we believe  DUBAI 00000349  002.2 OF 003   that often this information is relayed to various security agencies, or during interviews conducted by security officers in Iran upon their return.    6. (C) This latest accusation also follows IRIG arrests of AIDS researchers, Arash and Kamiyar Alaei, documentary filmmaker Mohammad Ehseni, and Sylva Hartounian, an employee of IREX, in 2008.  Arash Alaei and Ehseni were alumni of IRPO IVLPs, while Hartounian was working on a maternal and child health exchange.  Another IVLP participant was subsequently harassed so much by Iranian intelligence that she fled the country, as she was no longer able to lead a normal life.  Another former IVLP participant fled Iran, and was subsequently resettled in the US, after learning he was targeted for arrest.  Other participants have had their passports seized and were temporarily banned from traveling outside Iran.  During fall 2008, Iranian authorities obstructed four IVLP programs by intimidating or threatening participants so that they withdrew from the programs (reftel).    A Change in Attitude  ---------------------    7.  (C) In May, however, we heard from IVLP participants and separately through a contact with access to IRIG sources that the IRIG had no opposition to these programs.   Arriving in Dubai to receive their visas, participants in three programs conducted over the summer told us that they had experienced no trouble or harassment from the IRIG and were enthusiastic over the possibility of developing working relationships with their American counterparts. These programs proceeded without problems, even during the election and its aftermath, except two folk musicians sought asylum in the US rather than return to Iran.    Comment  ----------    8.  (C)  The inclusion of our IVLP programs and IRPO in the indictment are supporting pieces of the IRIG's larger objective of presenting election unrest as a product of a sweeping conspiracy.  They are convenient "evidence" of a US bent on "velvet revolution," and some elements within the IRIG -- most likely  in the IRGC -- believe in such a plot, or see the utility in using them to foster such belief.  At a minimum their inclusion serves as a warning to reformists and others who would be more open to better relations with the US at a time when the regime is under pressure from within.  At the same time, there are factions within the IRIG who understand the true nature of these exchange programs.  We have heard that there are those within the IRIG, specifically in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and even the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, who have been supportive of these programs or at least had no objection to them in the past.   Our success in bringing nearly 250 Iranians to the US, including those who traveled this summer during the election, indicates that there have been conscious decisions by the IRIG to allow the programs to go forward, perhaps as a sign of Iranian interest in better relations.   It appears, however, that after the election those who see them as a threat are again dictating the Iranian response.    9. (C) By the Iranians' own admission in the indictment, these exchange programs have been successful in their stated goals, and we believe public and cultural diplomacy continue to provide opportunities for engaging the Iranian people and even some segments of the IRIG.  In the event relations improve in the future, these activities can be one of the most immediate ways we could advance a bilateral relationship.    10. (C) Amid the current raised suspicions and flux within the IRIG, however, we should be cautious in proceeding with further exchanges out of concern for the safety of the participants. There are real risks involved to anyone thought to be serving  DUBAI 00000349  003.2 OF 003   USG interests, and we think that right now, the risks have risen substantially in the current atmosphere.  With the situation in Iran so unsettled, we believe it would be prudent to delay any pending IVLP exchange programs until there are clearer indications of IRIG intentions toward them.   (NOTE:  To insulate our public diplomacy programs and maintain IRPO's low profile, IRPO has had no involvement in civil society and democracy programs run by the Department.  Our recommendation only extends to IVLP exchange programs.) EYRE 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000361  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  8/31/2019 TAGS: PGOV, ECON, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: THE POLITICS OF BREAD  DUBAI 00000361  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (e) 1. (C) Summary: Traditional flat breads are a staple of the Iranian diet and offer a window into the problems of Iran's economy.  Iranians eat flat bread daily, particularly 'nan-e sangak', and its importance has made bread prices a political issue, particularly as prices have doubled since approximately March of this year.  In the past, rises in bread prices have caused widespread unrest and even the occasional riots, most notably in 1995.  Bread prices are often a topic in state-run news broadcasts and the IRIG controls prices both via a subsidy for flour and by actively monitoring the price stores and bakeries charge for their bread. The flour subsidy gives bakeries-both larger, modern bread factories and the traditional producers-flour at about 15 percent of the price for store-bought flour. Subsidized prices also create a black market for flour, which the IRIG fights with prison terms for those caught illegally re-selling subsidized flour and also by closing down some of the traditional producers, whose inconsistent daily production is alleged to feed the black market.  End Summary.    2. (C) IRPO recently spoke with a Tehrani bread factory owner, who discussed bread preferences, prices, and the importance of bread in Iran.    The Importance of Iran's Traditional Breads...    3. (C) Traditional flat breads have long been a staple of the Iranian diet; there are several different versions, reflecting regional differences and individual preferences.  The baker we spoke with said 'nan-e sangak' (a plain rectangular or triangular whole wheat sour dough flatbread) is the most popular bread and he compared its place in the national psyche to a turkey's prominence at Thanksgiving. Nan-e sangak is eaten daily for breakfast, often with cheese.  The bread is cooked over a pebble-based stove-'sang' means stone in Farsi-and comes in three different versions: sadeh, khoskhashi, and zaffaron. Sadeh, meaning simple, is the basic version and currently costs 5000 rials, about 50 cents - double from what it was six months ago.  Khoshkhashi includes some spices, was reputed to be the preferred version according to the baker, and costs $1.00. Zaffaron includes saffron and costs about $1.50. Nan-e sangak is one of several traditional flat breads.  Others include nan-e barbari, which is popular in Iran's Azeri regions, nan-e toftun, a cheaper bread variety similar to Indian nan, and nan-e lavash, a very thin, simple flat bread.    ...Makes its Price a Political Issue    4. (C) The price for bread is supposed to be the same throughout Tehran and the IRIG will occasionally conduct price checks to ensure correct pricing; in late August the IRIG announced it was sending 600 officials to check bread prices throughout Tehran. Bread quality and prices are occasionally mentioned in Friday Prayers and often come up in state-run news broadcasts.    5. (C) The IRIG regulates the price bread via its flour subsidies.  Iranian farmers sell their flour to the government, and the IRIG also imports flour to make up for shortfalls in domestic production.  The government then sells its flour at a subsidized rate to bread manufacturers; the subsidized rate is 460 rials/kilogram (about 5 cents/kilogram).  The rate available in grocery stores is approximately 3000 rials/kilogram (about 30 cents/kilogram).  According to the baker, the IRIG will increase its price for flour quietly, as it did six months ago.  The bakers have no choice but to pass the price increase on to its consumers, whereby the government blames the bakers for the price increase and bakers blame the government.    6. (C) The price discrepancy between the subsidized and unsubsidized flour fuels a black market for cheap flour.  The baker said being caught selling flour purchased from the government at subsidized prices on the black market can yield prison sentences of up to one year.  He also said that the IRIG  DUBAI 00000361  002.2 OF 002   is trying shut down many of the small, more traditional bread bakers.  Although the IRIG publicly asserts the cleanliness of these bakeries does not meet its standards, in reality, the government is concerned that these bakers are selling their excess flour on the black market.  Whereas the larger bread factories-such as that owned by our interlocutor-have consistent bread demand and hence production each day, the smaller bakeries' production varies from day to day, giving them fodder for the black market.    7. (C) Comment: Iran's bread market shows the distorting effects of subsidies and the corresponding rise in black market activities.  Although the Iranian government remains sensitive to the political consequences of rising bread prices, its seeking a solution in law enforcement vice market mechanisms doesn't address the core problem, and the consequent rise in this essential staple is one of the most palpable consequences of Iran's mismanaged economy for the average citizen.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Since taking over the Judiciary in mid-July, Hojjatoleslam Sadeq Larijani has taken steps seemingly designed to assuage ongoing public anger over the government's brutal treatment of detainees and opportunistic persecution of the hardliners' political foes.  Foremost among these steps are creating a commission to investigate the government's response to post-election unrest, and high-profile personnel changes to include removing the powerful Tehran chief prosecutor, Saeed Mortazavi, and appointing former Intelligence Minister Mohsen Ejaei as his deputy. These steps have been touted by some oppositionists as a 'retreat' by Supreme Leader Khamenei, to whom Larijani answers, and interpreted in the western press as calculated moves to balance Ahmadinejad and the hardliners. However, a closer look reveals the changes are likely more tactical and superficial than strategic and substantive: the Tehran prosecutor was actually promoted to a higher position after being removed; and the commission established to investigate the government's response to the unrest is composed of men with long professional histories of egregious human rights abuses.  End Summary.    2. (C) Much attention has been given to Sadeq Larijani's August 29 dismissal of Tehran Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi, one of the most infamous conservative hardliners responsible for crushing reformist opposition in the last decade, whose name is on many of the bills of indictment in the latest show trials. However he was hardly thrown under the bus, as one day after he was removed from his position Larijani appointed him as Deputy National Prosecutor General, a position that putatively outranks his former one.  Mortazavi, who gained notoriety for his alleged personal involvement in detainee abuses over his six-year tenure, is considered very close to Khamenei but has also been a staunch ally of Ahmadinejad, and has aggressively wielded his authority to silence reformist papers and prosecute government critics.    3. (SBU) Also on August 29, Larijani issued a decree establishing a three-man commission to conduct a "fair, firm and swift" examination of the government's post-election conduct in order to identify and, if necessary, punish official misconduct.  The three-person panel, including Prosecutor General Hojjatoleslam Mohsen Ejaei and Judiciary deputy chief Hojjatoleslam Ebrahim Raisi, is to report directly to Larijani. The commission will begin its work by looking into the allegation of detainee abuse outlined in a report submitted to the government by Mehdi Karroui earlier this month.    4. (C) COMMENT: Larijani's appointment of Mortazavi belies the supposition that he is in any way 'housecleaning' the Judiciary of extremist hardliners, and more likely indicates a tactical re-arrangement of personnel to placate both aggrieved conservative elites and also popular sentiment. Similarly, his creating a commission to look into the government's handling of cases related to the unrest and to "continuously supervise" the prosecutors and trials is likely more of a public diplomacy strategy than a sincere effort to hold officials accountable for abuses.  The panel's membership, which includes Ebrahim Raisi, who co-chaired the Tehran "Death Commission" during the 1988 massacre of political prisoners, suggests the hardliners have little to fear from the group's mandate, and it is unlikely that this group's findings will do more than finger a few scapegoats.    5. (C) COMMENT (CONT): Just as it is too early to discern Larijani's goals or relative influence within the system, attempts to infer meaningful change to the government's current trajectory based on his actions are similarly premature. One IRPO contact, a Dubai-based Iranian analyst, noted that as with most government positions in Iran, the power within the Judiciary is vested in the person and his place within the vast interlocking network of competing and cooperating patronage systems rather than the job title itself. Outgoing judicial chief Ayatollah Shahroudi was seen as more independent and less subservient to Khamenei than his predecessor, and it is widely thought that Khamenei installed Mortazavi as Tehran Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor to more fully implement his will within the Judiciary.  As such, during Shahroudi's tenure Mortazavi ran a virtually independent fiefdom within the Judiciary.  It could well be that given Larijani's greater presumed subservience to Khamenei, plus Mortazavi's increasingly toxic reputation, it was  DUBAI 00000362  002.2 OF 002   time to find him another, lower-profile position in the Judiciary.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY:   In recent public speeches both Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Ahmadinejad have each repeated key talking points about the post-election unrest.  Both have emphasized that this unrest is the result of a vast long-planned conspiracy by Iran's foreign enemies to besmirch the resounding regime victory in the June 12 vote, and to topple the Islamic Republic from within via a "soft coup."  Khamenei has stressed that all violations of the law will be dealt with within the legal process.  While admitting that Iranian government officials did violate the law, most noticeably at the Kahrizak detention center and during the June 15 storming of University of Tehran dormitories, he notes that such violations however pale into unimportance relative to the injustices done to the regime by those seeking to topple it.  As the September 23 opening of the University School year approaches, Khamenei has also stressed the key role that college students and professors will play on the 'front lines of the Soft War,' while also noting that university-level humanities courses could be another insidious vehicle for the import of Western and secular ideas into Iran.  For his part, Ahmadinejad has focused on defending his last four years, while also vowing to continue the fight against high-level corruption amidst the rich and powerful, which many analysts read as an allusion to Ayatollah Rafsanjani and his peers.  In distinction to Khamenei, Ahmadinejad has ascribed the Kahrizak and Tehran University incidents to "the enemy."   END SUMMARY.    2. (U) Both Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Ahmadinejad have made a number of recent public comments in which they have referred to the post-election unrest, with the major ones as follows:    KHAMENEI AUGUST 26 STUDENT SPEECH    3. (U) On August 26 Supreme Leader Khamenei addressed an Eftar dinner for selected (hardcore conservative) University student groups, with his speech preceded by speeches by representatives of these groups.  This was the first time that Khamenei had addressed student groups since the post-election unrest to include the altercations at Tehran University.   The tone of these student speeches was uniformly strident, with the students criticizing virtually every organ of the Iranian government except for the Supreme Leader, to include (inter alia):    - complaining about the June 15 attacks at Tehran University and other universities;    - calling for an investigation of Ayatollah Rafsanjani's son Mehdi Hashemi and the "mafia controlling Azad University" to include its President Abdollah Jasebi, based on the recent confessions made by those being tried for post-election disturbances;    - questioning the loyalty of both the Majlis leadership and the membership of the Expediency Council;    -severely criticizing the performance of President Ahmadinejad, his Ninth Administration, the influence of the "Kordan, Rahimi and Mashaei" clique, and his Tenth Cabinet nominations;    - demanding the expulsion of the British Ambassador from Tehran;    - claiming Presidential candidate Mir Hossin Mousavi and former President Khatami were involved in plots against Iran and called for their being tried in court (which drew loud applause from the student audience).   DUBAI 00000363  002.2 OF 003     4. (U) Khamenei's response to this young audience, composed of many of his most fervent supporters, was that: - Decisive action will be taken against those involved in the post-election disturbances, to include those 'behind the scenes,' but this action must be based on proof and evidence, not on rumors.  In this regard, he was not accusing anyone specific of being foreign agents "because such a thing has not been proven to me and I can't talk about something which hasn't been proven" (COMMENT: This statement was seized on by Western press as indicating that Khamenei was in some way exonerating opposition leaders of being foreign agents.  In the context of his emphasis on the need for proof, all he was saying was that he could not currently make such a claim, as it had not yet been proved. END COMMENT)    - The incidents at Tehran University and Kahrizak will be dealt with decisively and those who violated the law will be punished, regardless of their organizational affiliation;    - The Kahrizak and Tehran University transgressions were unimportant relative to the injustice done to the Islamic Republic of Iran's reputation due to these post-election disturbances, which besmirched the epic June 12 election.    - Ahmadinejad had his strong and weak points, but as Khamenei does not publicly focus on the deficiencies of government officials when private correction can be more effective;    - Today the Islamic Republic was involved in a great "soft war," and these students were the young officers on the "front line of this war."    KHAMENEI AUGUST 30 UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SPEECH    5. (U) On August 30 Supreme Leader Khamenei gave a speech to university professors in which he expressed his deep concern with the fact that out of a national university population of 3.5 million, approximately two million were studying humanities, much of which was based on 'Western, materialistic' (vice Islamic) principles.  He again alluded to the "Soft War" being waged against Iran, adding that these university professors were the "commanding officers" in this war.  He also repeated his 'law and order' statement that the government will deal with all those who have broken the law in the post-election unrest.    AHMADINEJAD STATEMENTS    6. (C)  At an August 26 Eftar dinner with Executive Branch workers, President Ahmadinejad defended his first term record, saying that his Ninth Administration had gotten a "good grade" from the Supreme Leader and from the Iranian nation, and that in his second term he would continue to work for the people and for justice.  He also said that he would continue to fight against corruption and that "the fight against lawbreakers must start with those who imagine themselves as 'owners of the country,'" a phrase that many observers assume refers to Hashemi Rafsanjani.    AHMADINEJAD AUGUST 28 FRIDAY PRAYER    7. (U) On Friday August 28 President Ahmadinejad spoke at Tehran's Friday Prayers (NOTE: Normally he wouldn't speak, but because it was government week he and other senior administration officials spoke at various Friday Prayer events).  His speech largely extolled his efforts and achievements over  DUBAI 00000363  003.2 OF 003   the previous four years.  Concerning the election and the post-election disturbances, he also described a vast Western-led conspiracy which mobilized all its resources, both inside and outside Iran, to derail the Revolution via the most recent Presidential elections.  Addressing those 'Satans' behind this plan, he added that Iran would agree to talk and deal with them only if they acted honestly and made up for these actions; otherwise Iran would deal severely with them.    8. (C) In contrast to what Supreme Leader Khamenei said two days earlier, Ahmadinejad claimed that the Kahrizak and Tehran University atrocities were part of the "enemy's scenario" and done by those seeking to overthrow the government (COMMENT: Although Ahmadinejad's comments on the culpability for Kahrizak and Tehran University are incongruent with Khamenei's, from the overall context it seems unlikely that  he is publicly challenging the Supreme Leader: it is more a difference in rhetoric).  As in his earlier speech, Ahmadinejad again vowed to take the fight to rich and powerful lawbreakers (read: Rafsanjani), saying that "if the holders of power and influence are exempt from punishment and only the weak are punished, " the Islamic Republic would not endure.    9. (C) COMMENT:  Both Khamenei's and Ahmadinejad's public position is that the post-election unrest is due to a vast western-led conspiracy to topple the Islamic Republic from within, as part of a "soft war" or "velvet revolution."  While there is some daylight between these two on smaller issues such as culpability for incidents at Kahrizak and Tehran University, it doesn't seem that this is as yet a significant source of tension between them.  However, given the nature of their collective base of support, it is a real question as to what extent those government entities  responsible for these actions will be prosecuted (according to some reformist websites, at least some of those removed from Kahrizak for these violations have quietly returned to work).  If contemporary Iranian history is a guide, then it is likely that a few 'bad apples' will be identified and sacrificed for the greater good, much like the case of Intelligence Ministry official Saeed Imami, who took the fall for the 1990s 'Serial Murders'  of dissident Iranian intellectuals, and then 'committed suicide' in prison.  Indeed, the recent Judiciary announcement that an investigative committee is being formed to look into post-election unrest (reftel) could be to be laying the groundwork for such a strategy.  However, Khamenei faces the delicate balancing act of trying to find a scapegoat for these violations who is high enough to be credible to those aggrieved elites offended by these transgressions but low enough not to alienate the IRGC intel/security cabal whose support he finds essential.    10. (C) It is worth noting however that the 'show trials' of those rounded up after the election are still ongoing, and no one within the ruling elite has disputed the veracity of the confessions being extracted from key defendants.  Indeed, as many IRPO interlocutors point out, the key dynamic playing out right now is between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad on the one hand and Rafsanjani on the other, with Rafsanjani supporting Mousavi, Khatami and Karrubi behind the scenes while also seeking to rally the clerical elite against Supreme Leader Khamenei and Ahmadinejad.  As such, the trial 'confessions' that implicate Rafsanjani's son Mehdi in various illegalities are a key tool in this ongoing struggle.   END COMMENT. EYRE 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 RPO DUBAI 000366  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/2/2019 TAGS: PGOV, IR, PREL, PARM SUBJECT: IRAN OFFICIALS, PRESS SPIN IAEA REPORT ON EVE OF P5+1 MEETING  DUBAI 00000366  001.2 OF 004   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Though Iran's envoy to the IAEA Ali Asghar Soltanieh and the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi took the nominal lead in spinning the August 28 IAEA report as a vindication of Iran's positions, their public comments offered little new insight to the Iranian leadership's mindset as the IRIG prepares to present its "revised proposal" to the P5+1.  However, the September 1 lead editorial of the hardcore conservative Kayhan newspaper, whose editorial stance is closely aligned with the Supreme Leader and whose editor is reputedly a confidante of Khamenei, provides an extensive evaluation of the report and its political implications for Iran.  The lengthy editorial argues that the United States has already concluded Iran will eventually join the nuclear club. The editorial characterizes I ran as occupying a position of strength and thereby not needing to negotiate, whereas due to (inter alia) its regional concerns the U.S. is compelled to seek interaction with Iran. END SUMMARY.    Iran's Revised Proposal Ready    2. (U) On September 1 Secretary of the Supreme National Security and chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili told reporters Iran is "ready to present a proposal to help resolve the world's common concerns and work toward the establishment of justice and peace. Jalili said that Iran's offer last year to negotiate was interrupted by various problems, to include the conflict in Georgia, the world economic crisis, and the U.S. presidential election.  "Now," however, after the "glorious presidential election in our country and with the authority and backing of a strong republic, we have a new proposal to offer."  Jalili's announcement came on the heels of aggressive campaign by IRIG senior officials and media to characterize the August 28 IAEA report as vindication of the peaceful nature of its nuclear program and highlight its cooperation with the IAEA.    IRIG Officials Play Up Positive Aspects of IAEA Report    3. (U) Predictably, Iran is interpreting the latest IAEA report as a vindication of its positions, with headlines quoting Iran's IAEA Representative Dr. Ali Asghar Soltanieh as saying, "from Iran's point of view the nuclear issue is settled." The new head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, emphasized the latest report is more positive than previous IAEA reports, a development he attributed in an interview on state radio to "Iran's new approach."  (NOTE: This "new approach" is presumably a reference to Iran's decision to allow IAEA inspectors to visit the heavy water reactor at Arak and the Natanz enrichment facility.)  A common IRIG talking point, echoed by both Soltanieh and Salehi as well as by Majles members andother sources, is that with this report IAEA chief Mohammad ElBaradei has declared Iran's nuclear program peaceful "for the twentieth time." (COMMENT: In this regard one can expect that the IRIG will make optimal publicity use of El-Baradei's just disclosed July comments that Iran's nuclear threat is "hyped," reported extensively in Iranian and Western press on September 2).    Iran's "New Approach" Pays Dividends    4. (U) After the report was released on August 28, in an interview with ISNA Soltanieh outlined examples of how Iran's "pro-active cooperation" with the IAEA resulted in more favorable report.  Specifically, he referenced the IRIG's decision to allow inspectors into the heavy water reactor at Arak, a move he said goes beyond Iran's treaty obligations.  He also said the IAEA heralded Iran's decision to give inspectors access to Natanz, noting that "Iran has carried out enrichment at Natanz with full transparency under the supervision and inspection of Agency cameras and inspection is ongoing." Soltanieh pointed to Iran's agreement to allow surprise inspections as another positive aspect of the IRIG's cooperation with the IAEA, emphasizing that Iran and the Agency agreed on procedures for unannounced inspections within the context of the Comprehensive Safeguards (vice the Additional Protocol).  DUBAI 00000366  002.2 OF 004   Similarly, he noted Iran and the IAEA have agreed on a method for accounting for nuclear materials.  In an August 30 ISNA interview Salehi also played up Iran's improved working relationship with the IAEA, attributing the Agency's decision to "resist certain belligerent countries" by excluding "undocumented studies" from its report as a direct benefit of Iran's enhanced cooperation.    5. (U) An August 30 pro-Ahmadinejad Fars News Agency piece focused on Salehi's criticism of the IAEA's referral of Iran to the UN Security Council, a step he termed "illegal" and "illogical" given Iran's fulfillment of its obligations.  The same article characterized Salehi as "lambasting" the West's "double standards" and describing allegations against Iran's nuclear program as politically motivated.    Kayhan Editorial Offers Window into Leadership's Mindset?    6. (U) The September 1 lead editorial from the hardcore conservative newspaper Kayhan dealt with the latest IAEA report and the possibility of Iran-US nuclear discussions.  Since this paper's editorial stance is widely regarded as a relection of that of the Supreme Leader, it is worth considering at length. Concerning the August IAEA report, the editorial said:    From a legal standpoint:    - The latest report is repetitive, with all the so-called "negative" points having been included in previous reports, to include the fact that Iran has not carried out verified suspension of its enrichment activities and that since the passage of UNSCR 1737 Iran has refused to carry out Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements.  Additionally, as Iran does not consider discussion of the "Alleged Studies" to be credible enough to discuss with the IAEA.    - Iran won't suspend its program because it views the forwarding of Iran's nuclear portfolio to the UN Security Council in February 2006 as a violation of the IAEA charter. Also,  Iranian suspension would vitiate any probably subsequent discussions in the future, as the talks held in 2003-2005 demonstrate.    - Iran will not carry out the Additional Protocols and Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements because they are all voluntary and Iran has no legal obligation to implement them.  Also, forwarding Iran's case to the Security Council led the Majles to pass a law barring the government from executing voluntary actions.    From a technical viewpoint:    - This report differed from previous ones, confirming that there are now more than 7000 IR-1 centrifuges, whereas at the time of the last report there were approximately 5000 installed at Natanz.    - The report's technical section shows that  Iran has solved all technical problems relating to expanding enrichment capacity and now has the technical ability for "any type of political decision" it wishes to make.  More importantly, the continuous increase in the number of centrifuges shows that Iran's domestic internal political crises do not influence the rate of development of Iran's nuclear program.   DUBAI 00000366  003.2 OF 004     From a political viewpoint:    - the legal aspects of the IAEA's latest report are unimportant relative to the political ones..  What are important to note are the political factors that influenced this report as well the report's political influence on the nuclear portfolio and Iran's national security.  It is clear that 'the Americans, Europeans and Zionists' saw a negative IAEA report as essential for the G-6 Group Strategy on Iran.  To this end, the West put heavy pressure on the IAEA for maximum negativity in this report.    - This strategy derives from President Obama's strategy, which emphasizes the necessity of negotiating with Iran.  America's regional problems compel it to engage with Iran, but the West now senses that Iran doesn't feel the need for talks with the West.    - The goal of the G-6 diplomacy is to draw Iran into negotiations and it is for this reasons that, in contrast to the past, they have expunged the word "suspension" from their vocabulary when talking about Iran.    - The West now knows that Iran's new government, with its massive validation by the recent Presidential vote, is in a very favorable position to resist Western demands.  The West doesn't believe the lies they themselves have created and know that there was no fraud in the recent election.    -Despite 'crazy Israeli assertions' that Iran's nuclear program has passed the point of no return and as such the only choice is living with the threat of a nuclear Iran or launching a military attack against Iran, the U.S. has clearly said that there is only one option and that is accepting Iran in the nuclear countries club.  America's viewpoint is that all that can be done is to adopt a series of cautionary measures such as extending American's nuclear umbrella to the region as Secretary Clinton has mentioned.  Therefore, it would not be strange if the West had concluded that talks with Iran must start as soon as possible, and if Iran is not currently willing to engage in this process it must be forced to do so.    - Western talk of gasoline sanctions is borne of such a mentality.  No one in the West says that if Iran does not suspend enrichment they will block oil exports to Iran; instead, all the talk is that if Iran does not enter talks by the end of September with the G-6 Group, "studying additional sanctions will begin."  As such, the threat of sanctions is essentially 'a disrespectful way of requesting Iran to enter negotiations.'    - The West's problem is that (inter alia) enacting a new round of sanctions will face Russian and Chinese opposition, given that the IAEA has announced that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and under supervision.  Therefore, the West has decided to bring pressure on the IAEA by publishing forged documents (NOTE: "alleged studies") as annexes to its report, and thereby strengthen its position with those who oppose sanctions.  But it is important to note that the report doe not in any way confirm the authenticity of these "alleged studies."    - In conclusion, the most important consequence of the latest IAEA report is that the IAEA places no credibility in the "alleged studies" and this in turn actually signifies the closing of Iran's nuclear file.  The 2007 "Agreed Modalities" document between Iran and the IAEA specified six subjects for discussion and now all six have been concluded.     DUBAI 00000366  004.2 OF 004   7. (C) COMMENT: Iran is spinning the latest IAEA report to contend that its nuclear issues with the IAEA are settled, and all else is Western bullying and bluster.  As for the announcement of its "new, improved" package, it is unclear whether it will be substantively different from the one it put on the table in May 2008.  END COMMENT. EYRE 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000369  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/3/2019 TAGS: PGOV, IR SUBJECT: MAJLIS PASSES 18 OF 21 AHMADINEJAD CABINET PICKS  DUBAI 00000369  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: The Majlis today approved 18 of Ahmadinejad's 21 cabinet nominees, including his controversial choice for Defense Minister.  The two-week run-up to the vote featured much public grumbling by Conservative Majlis members about both lack of prior executive branch consultation on the nominees and also about many nominees' lack of relevant job experience.  In the days prior to the vote there were also press reports both of widespread bribing of Majlis deputies, and also of pressure from Supreme Leader Khamenei for the Majlis to approve Ahmadinejad's cabinet, to preserve the appearance of national unity.  Although one female nominee was approved, making her Islamic Iran's first female minister, two of the three rejected candidates are women, and their defeat may reflect conservative and religious discomfort with women ministers.  Proposed Defense Minister Vahidi, whose nomination became controversial internationally because of his alleged involvement in a 1994 terrorist incident, secured the highest number of votes.  Although the number of spurned Cabinet nominees was one fewer than his first term and fewer than many had anticipated, given that prior to Ahmadinejad almost all Presidential cabinet nominees were approved without exception, this vote and the process leading up to it bespeaks nothing so much as a politicized and fractious atmosphere within the ruling conservative elite.  END SUMMARY.    2. (C) The Majlis today confirmed 18 of Ahmadinejad's 21 proposed ministers, including the controversial pick for Defense Minister, Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi (NOTE: Vahidi's nomination prompted an international outcry due to his alleged participation in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina.)  Perhaps most surprising was the confirmation of Ahaminejad's Oil Ministry nominee Seyyed Masud Mirkazemi. Mirkazemi was the Commerce Minister in Ahmadinejad's first term but several Majlis members had excoriated Mirkazemi's nomination to this key position due to his total lack of petroleum sector experience.  Given Ahmadinejad's difficulty getting his Oil Ministry pick confirmed in 2005, when the Majlis rejected three nominees in a row, many analysts expected the Majlis to reject Mirkazemi's nomination.    3. (C) Proposed Health Minister Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi was also confirmed with 175 out of 286 total votes, making her the first post-Revolutionary female cabinet minister. Her approval is not entirely unexpected, given that she also has been active in health issues for many years, has worked in the Health Ministry, and served in the Majlis from 1992-2000.  The rejection of the two other female cabinet picks (for the Education and Welfare Ministries) could indicate lack of conservative and religious comfort with the idea of female ministers or could instead be indications of continued sparring over these two ministries, each of which control vast and potentially lucrative bureaucracies.    4. (C) The proposed Energy Minister Mohammad Aliabadi was the other nominee (and the only man) to have been rejected. Aliabadi was Ahmadinejad's Vice President for Physical Education and headed Iran's national Olympic committee.  He was criticized for lacking any experience in the energy field, although given the overall lack of qualifications of many of the candidates, it is unlikely that this was the sole cause of his defeat.  He had the most contentious hearing process, with corruption allegations featuring prominently in them.    5. (C) The final vote comes on the heels of speculation about the propriety of the confirmation process.  There had been rumors and press stories in recent days alleging Majlis deputies were bribed to gain their support, and reports of lavish Iftars feting the Majlis members to curry favor.  These rumors did not slow the vote and do not appear to have derailed any of the nominees.  Other press reports indicate Supreme Leader Khamenei exerted pressure on the Majlis to approve Ahmadinejad's nominees to prevent the appearance of disunity within the government during this politically sensitive time.  Khamenei does typically pre-approve several of the key Ministerial nominees (Intelligence Minister, Interior Minister, Foreign Affairs Minister, and Islamic Culture and Guidance Minister) and as such their confirmation was not surprising.    DUBAI 00000369  002.2 OF 002    6. (C) COMMENT: This confirmation process and the exact number approved in and of itself will have little long-term effect on Ahmadinejad's second term.  Many of his supporters (and some Western press) are interpreting this vote as a `victory,' as the outcome could have been worse.  Prior to the vote, senior Majlis members predicted that "at least four or five nominees would be rejected" and several expressed their frustration with Ahmadinejad's failure to consult with parliamentarians before making his selection.  However one IRPO contact who has served in the Majlis notes that such public comments by Majlis members are unimportant, as last-minute deals and horse-trading immediately before the vote tend to be determinative. Only two candidates-two of the three women nominated-received more `nay' votes than `yea' votes.  This time, the number of spurned Cabinet nominees was one fewer than four years ago when the Majlis rejected Ahmadinejad's picks for the Ministries of Oil, Education, Cooperatives, and Social Welfare. However, given that prior to Ahmadinejad almost all Presidential cabinet nominees were approved without exception, this vote and the process leading up to it bespeaks nothing so much as the politicized and fractious atmosphere within the ruling conservative elite that Ahmadinejad's Presidency has created.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The IRIG is pursuing several strategies simultaneously to cow the opposition and to prevent further protests.  Some elements of this strategy include the ongoing show trials of prominent reformers, pressuring opposition leaders by arresting or threatening family members, canceling public events to prevent opposition gatherings, monitoring Iran's universities, and waging a relentless rhetorical campaign to discredit opposition leaders.  Although the government's preferred weapons involve coercion, it is also using the Judiciary to support its contention that it will deal legally with those few elements of the regime who may have gone to excess in reacting to the post-election disturbances. It is unclear to what extent the IRIG response reflects a coordinated effort but the intensity of its response indicates its very real desire to defuse the volatile situation it created with the election fraud and subsequent brutal crackdown, by any means necessary. End Summary.    2. (C) Elements within the IRIG have begun using opposition leaders' family members as leverage. Expediency Council head Rafsanjani's daughter was arrested early on during the protests, along with a few other Rafanjani family members, and quickly released. Now, others face possible arrest or have been arrested.  Rafsanjani's son Mehdi Hashemi (and nephew Ali) were accused during the show trial of corruption and Iranian media in late August said there were rumors that they would be arrested for financial corruption.  According to Fars News, Iran's Judiciary on September 6 issued an arrest warrant for Mehdi Karroubi's son Ali based on allegations of financial wrongdoing in connection with a business deal.  Separately, BBC Farsi is reporting that the IRIG arrested nineteen year old Atefeh Imam, the daughter of Mojahedin of the Revolution member Javad Imam. She was arrested September 6, and family members said her arrest was intended to pressure her father into confessing. He was arrested in June.    3. (C) The IRIG has cancelled or changed the location of key public events in a probable bid to deny the opposition a public space to gather. Former President Khatami and others were scheduled to speak during the annual Qadr night at the Imam Khomeini shrine, and there were reports that the opposition would use this occasion to turn out in force as a show of strength.  According to Iranian media, Khomeini's family was under pressure from the IRIG to prevent Khatami from speaking in response to which Hassan Khomeini canceled the event, which has been a Ramadan staple for the last two decades.  Separately, the IRIG moved the Supreme Leader's annual end of Ramadan Eid al-Fitr address from its typical location at Tehran's massive Grand Prayer venue to a smaller University of Tehran one, presumably to deny the opposition an opportunity to gather in strength.  In Qom, many clerics identified with the opposition are being prevented from speaking at Ramadan events, with more pro-Ahmadinejad clerics being substituted. Finally, the IRIG for the first time withheld permission for the public commemoration of Ayatollah Taleghani's death, an event scheduled for September 9. Taleghani was a key figure in the 1979 Revolution and has since become a symbol of revolutionary purity and piety. According to BBC Farsi, Taleghani's daughter Azam, a prominent reformist and womens' rights activist, said that another celebration sponsored by the government is not connected to his family. All these cancellations and venue changes come after Mehdi Karroubi's late August call for Iranians to take advantage of Qods day, falling at the end of Ramadan, to protest against the government.    4. (C) The IRIG is also trying to assuage popular discontent by using the Judiciary to review allegations of government misconduct. Newly-installed Judiciary Chief Hojjatoleslam Sadegh Larijani in late August charged a three-person committee with investigating detainee abuse as part of a larger review of government action following the election (COMMENT: Much like the Guardian Council's post-election investigation found no evidence of electoral fraud, this committee is highly unlikely to publicize any significant wrongdoing on the part of the IRIG, but is likely to blame a few low-level officials for various abuses in a bid to placate popular discontent over government excesses  (reftel)).    DUBAI 00000373  002.2 OF 002    5. (C) Although university classes are still scheduled to begin on time in late September, the IRIG is clearly nervous about the approaching school year.  Students strongly supported Mousavi in the presidential election and participated in the opposition protests following the election, leading to the delay and cancellation of some university exams this summer. Now, there are reports of stepped-up security on campus and more Basij students to quell potential unrest. In late August Supreme Leader Khamenei emphasized the important role academics and students play in preventing a velvet revolution, calling them "senior commanders and commanders" (respectively) in the "Soft War." He also complained that the prevalence of Western-based humanities studies in Iranian universities undermined Islamic beliefs, prompting the Supreme Cultural Council to subsequently begin reviewing humanities curriculum.  This renewed emphasis on Islam in the universities has prompted oppositionist fears of a second "Cultural Revolution," similar in intent if not in scope to the 1980-1983 closing of Iranian universities and subsequent purging of faculty and curricula.    6. (C) The IRIG's rhetorical war against opposition leaders continues unabated.  Attacks against reformers are prominent in the show trials, but also in other officials' public comments. In an early September speech to IRGC veterans, IRGC Commander Jafari charged that former President Khatami and other prominent reformists had viewed the election as a means to rid Iran of the Velayat-e Faqih; Ahmadinejad on September 7 named those who questioned the election "dictators" and called for those who managed the post-election unrest to be "brought to justice"; and Friday prayer leaders have called repeatedly for the leaders of the unrest to be arrested. The rhetoric is intended to discredit the opposition leaders and may be setting the stage for their eventual arrest.    7. (C) Finally, the IRIG is closely monitoring public areas in Iran to prevent additional protests.  An IRPO contact in late August said that although a veneer of normalcy has returned, plain clothes security forces are evident in Tehran. The IRGC too has repeatedly asserted its role in protecting the Revolution from internal threats, leaving little doubt that security forces remain at the ready to suppress unauthorized public gatherings.    8. (C) Comment: It is unclear if the IRIG's efforts to undermine the opposition reflect a coordinated, strategic approach to neutralizing the opposition or are instead simply reactive, defensive measures. Similarly, the degree to which the Supreme Leader's office, elements in the IRGC, or others, are coordinating the IRIG response is unknown.  What is clear is that the current IRIG playbook is derived from the leadership's view of the 1979 Revolution, with the conventional wisdom among Iran's current rulers being that his vacillation indicated weakness, which emboldened the opposition, and led to his downfall, as did his refusal to use violence against his own people.  At every critical junction since the June 12 elections, Supreme Leader Khamenei and others have chosen to stand firm if not to increase pressure, so as not to project an image of weakness. It is unclear to what extent the IRIG response reflects a coordinated effort but the intensity of its response indicates its very real desire to defuse the volatile situation it created with the election fraud and subsequent brutal crackdown, by any means necessary.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY:  With a series of raids and arrests on September 7 and 8, the government moved aggressively to stop efforts by the Iran 'Green Path' opposition and human rights advocates to document and publicize allegations of detainee abuse and extrajudicial killings by the security forces in the wake of the June 12 election.  This move follows the Iranian opposition's dissemination of the identities of 72 people purportedly killed by the authorities in the post-election crackdown, far higher than the number officially acknowledged, as well as detailed allegations of detainee sexual abuse submitted to the Majlis and the Judiciary by Mehdi Karrubi.  By order of the newly-appointed Tehran Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor, authorities closed the "Committee for Following the Situation of Detainees, " the organization set up by presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi to advocate on behalf of victims of the government's post-election crackdown.  A second organization, the "Association to Defend Prisoners Rights," is a prominent human rights organization whose members have been targeted by the authorities since its 2004 founding.  Security officials also arrested senior aides affiliated with both Mousavi and Karrubi, as well as the editor of Karrubi's main website.  These incidents confirm the government's preference for coercion over compromise, and its continuing if not increased pressure on the leadership of the "Green Path" opposition to stand down and fall in line.  Iran press recently announced that Supreme Leader Khamenei will be giving this Friday's Tehran Prayer sermon, and all players will be keenly awaiting his public comments to detect any change in regime attitudes or tactics.  END SUMMARY.    2. (U) According to Iranian press and oppositionist accounts, over the course of September 7-8, the government took the following steps to stop oppositionist activities:    - On Monday, September 7, security officials went to the office of the "Committee for Following the Situation of Detainees," (CFSD) an organization set up by Karrubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi after the post-June 12 crackdown, took away documents, records and a computer, then closed and sealed the office;      - On Monday, September 7, security officials raided the office of "Association to Defend Prisoners Rights," an NGO founded in 2004 by prominent human rights dissident Emaddedin Baghi, took away records, documents, and computers, then closed and sealed the office;    - On Tuesday, September 8 at approximately 1530 hours, officials from Tehran Prosecutor's Office appeared at defeated Presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi's Tehran office, interrogated employees, confiscated documents, records, CDs, films, papers and office supplies, escorted all personnel out (to include Karrubi himself), then locked and sealed the office;    - At approximately the same time, another group of Tehran Prosecutor's Office officials entered Karrubi's "National Trust" (Etemad-e Melli) political party office in another part of Tehran, interrogated employees and party members present, confiscated documents, records, CDs, films, papers and office supplies, escorted all personnel out, then locked and sealed the office;    - Shortly after the two simultaneous September 8 incidents cited directly above, security officials armed with an order from Tehran's new Prosecutor General arrested prominent reformer and close Mousavi aide Dr. Ali Reza Beheshti, the CFSD spokesman and son of the late Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, Iran's first Judiciary head and one of the seminal figures in the 1979 Islamic Revolution;    - On September 8 officials arrested Mohamad Davari, the editor of "Saham News," Etemad-e Melli's website;  DUBAI 00000375  002.2 OF 002      - On September 8 officials searched the house of and then arrested former Tehran Mayor and prominent reformist politician Morteza Alviri, who was serving both as advisor to Karrubi and as his representative on the "Committee for Following the Situation of Detainees."    3. (U) The September 7 raid on the Committee for Following the Situation of Detainees followed the group's publication of the identities (and circumstances surrounding the deaths) of 72 persons it says were killed by security forces for protesting the election results - a number far higher than officially acknowledged.  The September 8 raid on Karrubi's office and that of his political party follows his compiling information about detainee abuse and trying to assist victims and their families. Based on this work, Karrubi made a series of highly-publicized allegations against the security forces that roiled the establishment, including accusations of sexual abuse, severe beatings, and killings.    Why Now and What Next?    4. (C) COMMENT:  Many analysts and "Green Path" oppositionists have stated that the government's primary motive in these actions was to stop the ongoing incendiary revelations about prisoner abuse.  Beyond this goal, one IRPO contact, a prominent Western-based oppositionist with extensive ties among the "Green Path" opposition, despaired that this latest series of office closings and arrests, along with recent statements by the IRGC Commander Jaafari, is laying the stage for the arrest of Mousavi and Karrubi themselves.  Another IRPO contact, a Dubai-based political analyst, said that this move by the regime is in a sense the "least that it could do," as it could not countenance a continuation of the opposition's (and especially Karrubi's) incendiary activities but did not want (yet) to arrest the principals themselves.  Regardless, this incident confirms Iran's preference for coercion over compromise, and its continuing if not increased pressure on the leadership of the "Green Path" opposition to stand down and fall in line.  Iranian press recently announced that Supreme Leader Khamenei will be giving this Friday's Tehran Prayer sermon, and all players will be keenly awaiting his public comments to detect any change in regime attitudes or tactics.   On a lesser note, the latest wave of crackdowns gives lie to the hope that the new Judiciary Chief Sadeq Larijani and the new Tehran Prosecutor General Abbas Jaafari Dolatabadi would adhere to "kinder, gentler" polices than their predecessors.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Ahmadinejad and Iran's media heralded the Majlis' vote confirming 18 of his 21 cabinet nominees as a boon for Iran's unity and national interests.  However, the confusion surrounding Ahmadinejad's aborted second-round nominations for the Ministries of Education and Energy and the reports that Khamenei's intervention was required to prevent the rejection of several other nominees belies such claims.  Both developments set off sniping among conservatives.  Khamenei's intervention in the cabinet confirmation underscores Ahmadinejad's political weakness and as it was, even the Supreme Leader's intervention was insufficient to save all of his nominees. Rather than bolstering the government, as the IRIG maintains, the cabinet vote highlights both the dissension within ruling conservative circles and Khamenei and Ahmadinejad's diminished stature due to the June 12 presidential election and its aftermath. End Summary.    2. (C) The confusion surrounding Ahmadinejad's aborted nominations for the Ministries of Education and Energy highlights the dissension among conservatives that surfaced during the Majlis vote on Ahmadinejad's proposed cabinet.  On September 3 the Majlis endorsed 18 of the President's 21 nominees, rejecting the proposed Ministers of Education, Energy, and Welfare.  On September 8 Ahmadinejad recalled the nominations of Fatemeh Alia as Education Minister and Ali Zabihi as Energy Minister, only two days after disclosing their names. A deputy Majlis speaker was quoted in the Iranian press as attributing the turnabout to guidance from the Supreme Leader delivered during a meeting between Khamenei and the new cabinet. Others speculated that senior clerics had again opposed the nomination of a female.  Additionally, BBC Farsi reported that the two nominations were met with immediate calls of "do do" in the Majlis, a Persian slight and a clear indication that some members of the Majlis were again disappointed with the President's cabinet offerings. Their displeasure may also account for the withdrawal of the nominations.    3. (C) However on September 8, Ahmadinejad's chief of staff and confidante Esfankiar Rahim Mashaei refuted these suggestions, telling press that Ahmadinejad still trusted the two nominees and that their withdrawal was due only to the Majlis recess. Mashaei denied hearing anything about clerical opposition to the nominations and asserted that the issue would pass once Ahmadinejad again submits the nominations.    4. (C) The back-and-forth over these two nominees adds to the post-confirmation sniping among conservatives. Shortly after the final cabinet confirmation vote, Majlis Deputy Speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar told press that several more Ahmadinejad nominees would have been rejected had the Supreme Leader not intervened. According to Bahonar, the Supreme Leader advised the Majlis that if they had reservations about the nominees, the Majlis should still give them the benefit of the doubt, though he cautioned that Khamenei had not ordered the Majlis to approve the nominees.  Other Majlis members reiterated that Khamenei had sent such guidance to the Majlis.    5. (C) Ahmadinejad's media adviser Ali Akbar Javanfekr responded that Bahonar was only trying to justify his efforts to block the nominations of eight nominees. (Note: Bahonar before the cabinet vote predicted that at least four or five nominees would be rejected.)  Javanfekr did confirm that Khamenei had given a message to the Majlis, though he maintained it was only an admonishment to work more "tolerantly" with the Ahmadinejad government.    6. (C) Comment:  Khamenei's willingness to go to bat for Ahmadinejad to prevent embarrassment and to maintain a fagade of unity in one sense suggests Khamenei remains supportive of the President.  Their relationship has been the subject of much speculation since Ahmadinejad publicly defied Khamenei over his failed appointment of Mashaei as First Vice-President, setting off a storm of criticism from conservative quarters. Still, Khamenei had little choice but to intervene on behalf of Ahmadinejad's nominees.  The defeat of several nominees would have been a blow to both Ahmadinejad and Khamenei, exposing how  DUBAI 00000377  002.2 OF 002   narrow Ahmadinejad's support even within the Iranian government has become.    7. (C) As it was, even the Supreme Leader's intervention was insufficient to save all of Ahmadinejad's nominees. Ahmadinejad in his two terms has had seven of his start of term ministerial nominees rejected, far more than any other president. Rather than bolstering the government, as the IRIG maintains, the cabinet vote highlights the dissension within the government and Khamenei and Ahmadinejad's diminished stature since the presidential election.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000378  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/14/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: KARRUBI'S ARREST APPEARS IMMINENT  DUBAI 00000378  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: There is widespread speculation that the government of Iran is moving closer to arresting Hojjatoleslam Mehdi Karrubi, the former Majlis Speaker and presidential candidate who has become the most vocal and persistent critic of the ruling establishment since the June 12 election.  This speculation follows a series of moves by the government indicating Karrubi could be prosecuted for 'fabricating' evidence of detainee rape and abuse, as well as an ominous warning from Supreme Leader Khamenei during his September 11 sermon that opponents of the system, regardless of their revolutionary backgrounds, will be dealt with decisively (septel).  Some oppositionist websites are reporting that Khamenei has already authorized Karrubi's arrest, and that execution of the warrant was only stayed by Expediency Council Chairman Ayatollah Rafsanjani's threat to resign his numerous government posts should Karrubi be arrested.    2. (C) SUMMARY CONT: As yet, Khamenei has resisted moving directly against the key figures associated with the opposition, no doubt fearing a backlash from both within the establishment and at the popular level at a time when he is working to restore a semblance of unity to Iran's fracturing political classes.  It is reasonable to assume that he will only authorize Karrubi's arrest if he feels the firebrand cleric's continuing provocations are a greater risk to system stability than the potential consequences of such a move. Either way, he is unlikely to move against Karrubi before Qods Day (September 18) for fear of giving the opposition additional motivation to draw supporters to the streets.  END SUMMARY.    3. (C) Over recent days, the government has taken a number of steps that appear to further prepare the ground for the eventual arrest of Karrubi and Mousavi.  These steps include:    -- The September 12 announcement by a high-level Judiciary panel that the evidence of rape and other forms of detainee abuse documented and put forward by Karrubi was knowingly fabricated in order to discredit the government and to agitate public opinion.  The committee further recommended that "those involved in the process" of compiling the allegations should be prosecuted, and subsequently Judiciary Head Larijani endorsed the findings of this investigative committee.    -- Arrests of the top aides to both Mousavi and Karrubi, including Dr. Alireza Beheshti, who was held several days before being released September 13 on $500,000 bail.  (NOTE: Beheshti, Mousavi's closest advisor and his point person on detainee abuse, was long thought inviolable because of his father's status as a martyred icon of the Revolution and a peer of Ayatollah Khomeini. END NOTE)    -- Issuance of an arrest warrant in early September for Karrubi's son on charges of financial wrongdoing.    -- Closure of Karrubi's office on September 7 and the subsequent blocking of the website of his political party, Etemad-e Melli.    -- The September 12 move by the Supreme Council of National Security to ban mention of Mousavi, Karrubi and the June 12 presidential election by the Iranian press.    4. (C) IRPO contacts reflect a growing consensus among Iran observers that the above steps indicate the government is steadily inching toward direct confrontation with the key leadership figures of the "Green Wave" opposition, should they not back down.  Karrubi is widely believed to be the most vulnerable, given his persistent and scathing criticism of Ahmadinejad and the government's conduct after the election.  A Dubai-based political analyst characterized Karrubi's arrest as a matter of "when" rather than "if."  Indeed, a story citing  DUBAI 00000378  002.2 OF 002   sources "close to Rafsanjani" emerged on many opposition and reformist websites September 13 alleging that Khamenei has already authorized Karrubi's arrest, and that the former Majlis Speaker remains free only because Rafsanjani personally intervened with the Supreme Leader and threatened to resign his many government posts if the warrant was executed.    5. (C) COMMENT: "Qods Day" Friday, September 18, is traditionally a time when the Iranian government tries to mobilize large street demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause.  This year the opposition plans to use Qods day as a show of strength of its own numbers, correctly assessing that the government would lose too much face by canceling this event.  As such, it is unlikely that the regime will risk inciting oppositionists even further by a Karrubi arrest before this event.  Similarly, the government may wish to give Karrubi a few days to weigh the benefits of not escalating but rather remaining quiet in the face of the Judiciary panel's finding.  However, if Karrubi continues on his current incendiary path it seems likely that the government will move against him, with no one knowing the consequences of such an escalation.  END COMMENT. EYRE

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 11 Supreme Leader Khamenei gave the main Tehran Friday Prayer sermon.  In his comments Khamenei sought to characterize his treatment of opposition in line with the practices of both the first Shia Imam Ali and also with that of his predecessor Ayatollah Khomeini.   He said while criticism within the framework of the existing political system was acceptable, those fundamentally opposing the system and seeking to harm the nation's security will be dealt with decisively.  In keeping with previous warnings about the "soft overthrow" of the existing order, he cautioned against dissolution from within, saying that the only way to prevent this was to remain true to religion, revolutionary principles, and to Khomeini's teachings.   The recent Presidential election with its massive turnout proved to the world that "regardless of whom the people voted for" they still believed in the system.  Referring to Iran's position on the international stage, Khamenei said Iran took pride in standing against the oppressive nature of its enemies and that Iran wouldn't be cowed into relinquishing its rights, "nuclear or non-nuclear."  He called for a large turnout on the September 18 Qods Day march in support of the Palestinian people, although warning that this event should not be used to "sow dissension," an implied reference to the fact that "Green Path" oppositionists are reportedly seeking a massive turn-out on this day as a show of strength.    2. (C) SUMMMARY (CONT): Although Supreme Leader Khamenei 's tone was consistently mild, Iranian press and IRPO contacts have interpreted this speech as a clear warning to the "Green Path" oppositionist leaders to cease and desist, an interpretation reinforced by the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated, and the forwarding of this case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution (reftel). END SUMMARY.    3. (U) On September 11, Supreme Leader Khamenei gave both Tehran Friday Prayer Sermons (normally there are two, the first covering ostensibly religious topics, the second focusing more on issues of the day).  As the date fell on the anniversary of the martyrdom of Imam Ali, the first Shia Imam, the topic of his first sermon was the government of Imam Ali.  Although putatively non-political in nature, Khamenei used this sermon to set the stage for themes to which he would refer back in his second, political, sermon.  He pointed out the moral nature of Imam Ali's government, adding that "when religion is separated from politics, politics becomes immoral and secular."  In an implicit comparison with current times, he also stressed that Imam Ali consistently preferred to be lenient in dealing with those who opposed him, until and unless there was a threat to the system, at which point he would act decisively.    TYPES OF CONFLICT    4. (U) In the start of his second, political speech, Supreme Leader Khamenei said he wished to address his remarks to those in Iran's political sphere.  Dissension had been a feature of the Islamic Republic since its founding.  These conflicts have had different causes, to include theoretical differences of opinion, conflicts of interest and clashing personalities. Referring implicitly to his comments on the management style of Imam Ali, Khamenei said that Khomeini's normal method for dealing with dissension and conflict was to use moderation and leniency.  In an implicit reference to Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, each of whom has referred back to his own revolutionary credentials, Khamenei said that at times Khomeini had to deal with conflicts even with those who had solid revolutionary backgrounds, at the level of the Prime Minister (i.e. Mousavi himself), President (Khamenei himself) and even at levels above the President (a reference to Khomeini's dismissal of Supreme Leader-designate Ayatollah Montazeri).    5. (U) Khamenei said the system didn't seek to stifle those who "think differently" (note: 'digar andishan," a term used to refer to the intellectual current associated, inter alia, with the Khatami-ist 'Second of Khordad' movement).  It was good for Iran's officials to have critics point out weaknesses if those  DUBAI 00000379  002.2 OF 003   doing so act within and accept the basic principles of the system, and the government will not move against such criticism.    6. (U) However, again drawing the link to Imam Ali, Khamenei said that during Khomeini's time if there were danger of infiltration of "harmful principles" into the system, and if this conflict were in some way a threat to core principles, Khomeini would then "act decisively." The regime, much like any human being, had to defend itself against such an attack. Linking his actions to those of Imam Ali and Khomeini, Khamenei said that today also the regime will act if it senses that someone is acting against its principles and security.    AVOIDING CORRUPTION FROM WITHIN    7. (U) In keeping with recent dominant public warnings about "soft overthrow" and "soft wars," Khamenei turned to the theme of corruption from within, both at an individual and societal level.  At an individual level, deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption were to be avoided at all costs, as small slips and mistakes could lead to larger ones in a slow and gradual process.  The cure for such threats is self-awareness, piety and the ongoing moral policing of friends and family.  If such impiety is happening to a government official the problem is worse, as it affects society.    8. (U) At a societal and governmental level, deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption can happen in much the same manner.  The decay comes from within, and although on the outside the society can still appear like an  "Islamic Republic," on the inside it could suffer degradation and decay.  In this regard, societal dynamics can either be positive or negative.  Positive dynamics means moving ever closer towards justice and religion, which improves social, political and economic conditions and also improves society's abilities to stand up to one's enemies.  But a society with negative dynamics will have growing class and social differences and worsening political and economic conditions.  Instead of using freedom for growth, such a decaying society will abuse freedom to pursue corruption, sin and dissension.  Such negative dynamics also cause the society to "feel weak and retreat" in the face of one's enemy, unilateral disarmament and relinquishing one's rights, nuclear and non-nuclear, which is another sign of societal decline.    ELECTION    9. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said the June 12 Presidential election with its massive turnout was a glorious triumph for the Islamic Revolution.  The turnout demonstrated to the world that the Iranian people believed in their system of government now more than ever, "regardless of who voted for whom.  After the election, the enemy sought to create disturbances in order to diminish Iran's achievement and weaken the peoples' confidence in the system, but to no effect.  There will be similarly large turnout in future elections, Khamenei predicted, showing the ongoing support of the people.    IRAN'S ENEMIES    10. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said all governments have enemies, but what is important to note is the nature of one's friends and enemies.  Iran's friends are Muslim nations and peoples throughout the world, and the oppressed of the world. Its enemies are the thieves and oppressors of the world, and Iran should not be scared to be the enemies of the U.S. and the U.K.  It was important for Iran to show strength in the face of such enemies.     DUBAI 00000379  003.2 OF 003   QODS DAY    11. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said that many on the global stage have tried to bury the issue of Palestine, but Iran has prevented that, a fact which has upset "the U.S. and the Zionists."  He called for a massive turnout of support on the September 18 Qods Day Rally in Tehran, and cautioned all that no one should use this event to sow dissension, an implicit reference to "Green Path" opposition plans to use this authorized march as a show of its own strength.    12. (C) COMMENT: Although his tone was mild, Iran oppositionist press in addition to IRPO interlocutors with ties to the "Green Path" opposition have said that, in the words of one source, "Khameni's speech was being viewed ominously in Iran," especially when viewed in conjunction with the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated, and forwarding the case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution (reftel).  According to one executive branch official, Khamenei's speech has made "the specter of the arrest of Karrubi - and possibly even Mousavi at a later stage" all the more probable.    13. (C) COMMENT (CONT): Contrary to Khamenei's assertions and as evidenced by recent comments by IRGC Commander Jaafari, the regime's interpretation of legitimate dissent has constricted dramatically, with Jaffari equating "soft overthrow" with those seeking to change Iran's behavior in any way.   Certainly, Khamenei seems to be trying to regain the high ground he forfeited by descending so openly into the political fray, as shown by his attempts to draw comparisons among himself, Khomeini, and Imam Ali.  Separately, the Supreme Leader's formulation of "relinquishing ones rights, nuclear or non-nuclear" as a sign of societal dissolution and immorality indicates that Iran will continue to adhere to its hard public line in advance of any future negotiations.  Finally, it is also worth noting that Supreme Leader Khamenei made no endorsement, either explicit or implicit, of President Ahmadinejad, saying only that the recent Presidential election was good due to the turnout, "regardless of who voted for whom."

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000382  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/16/2019 TAGS: ECON, PGOV, PREL, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: AHMADINEJAD TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT GASOLINE SUBSIDY  REFORM  DUBAI 00000382  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DoS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY:  President Ahmadinejad has opened his second term intending to pursue gasoline subsidy reform.  Although the Majlis refused to endorse the proposed reforms at the end of his first term, this time Ahmadinejad seems to have the support of Supreme Leader Khamenei, and the government is feigning flexibility by publicly offering alternatives.  In reality, however, Ahmadinejad wants his politically unpopular proposal to remove subsidies and provide cash payments to targeted low-income individuals pushed through the Majlis. Gasoline subsidies are the third rail of Iranian politics, and re-introducing such a controversial program amid continuing political instability and Ahmadinejad's personal unpopularity hints at the economic reality of Iran's weaker foreign reserve and current account deficit position, and the recognition that continued massive subsidies for gasoline are not sustainable. Even with the Supreme Leader's support, the proposal will be unpopular, and knowledgeable IRPO contacts have said that any Western-led gasoline sanctions might give Ahmadinejad the cover he needs by allowing him to blame sanctions for any and all gasoline-related problems.  End Summary.    PROPOSED `SHOCK AND AWE' PACKAGE FAILED TO `SHOCK AND AWE'    2. (C) Towards the end of its first term the Ahmadinejad administration pushed a `targeted' gasoline subsidy reform bill, coupling subsidy removal with cash payments to low-income populations.  The Majlis refused to endorse the bill due to questions about Ahmadinejad's political motive in an election year, the possible increase in inflation that cash payments might trigger, and the overall rushed manner in which the administration demanded that funds be allocated to execute the program.  In addition, the lack of enthusiasm for reform reflected strong public support for maintaining subsidies.    3. (C) One journalist who interviewed Majlis members about a gasoline reform program told IRPO that the deputies widely perceived Ahmadinejad's first-term reform package as an irresponsible attempt to "shock-and-awe" the public with economic reform intended to reverse putatively elitist oil wealth distribution, consistent with his campaign pledge to 'put Iran's oil wealth on the table of ordinary Iranians.'  The reporter added that while Majlis members protested the package largely for their own political reasons, many recognized that cash handouts to sub-sections of the population identified as lower-class would add to inflation.    GASOLINE DOWN THE DRAIN    4. (U) While the Ahmadinejad plan to couple the end of gasoline subsidies with cash payments to the lowest nine groups of income-earners in Iran (to be determined by survey if the legislation is passed) did not find favor with legislators, most recognize the severity of the economic impact the current program creates.  The current subsidy program provides Iranians a monthly 100 liter quota per personal vehicle and 300 liter quota per business vehicle at $0.35 per gallon.  This price represents one-fifth the market price and a direct cost to the government of between USD 3-6 billion a year.  The gasoline subsidy program also fuels wasteful consumption (the growth in the rate of gasoline consumption is twice that of the growth in the rate of GDP) and an annual USD one billion (1.8 billion liters) smuggling operation of gasoline out of the country as well as a large internal black market for gasoline.  As a result, the program hampers state revenues and indirectly erodes Iran's oil export market.  In total, the program is estimated to consume 10-20 percent of GDP annually.    5. (U) Current economic data also indicates that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the government to fund the subsidy program through the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF).  An ongoing current account deficit, a projected fiscal deficit of over 13 percent (USD 42 billion) to GDP for the current year, and an  DUBAI 00000382  002.3 OF 003   increasingly larger budget required to support other government expenditures means the government has repeatedly raided the OSF not only to fund the gasoline subsidy program but various other government expenditures as well.  Head of the Majlis Economic Commission Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam told the Mehr News Agency in March that the OSF had declined to USD 23 billion, far short of the projected USD 42 billion projected deficit for 2009/2010.  The government has tried to increase state revenue recently by pumping 200,000 b/d beyond its OPEC-allocated output quota as well as by aggressively offering bonds in the domestic market.  Neither action is enough to meet the large deficit gap which means the subsidy program remains an increasingly large drain on revenues.    THE ALTERNATIVES    6. (U) The government has announced the continuation of the subsidy program through October but also has proposed three possible options on gasoline going forward in the second half of the Persian year (October through March). The first would continue the current subsidy program.  By the Ahmadinejad government's estimation, this option would require the Majlis to approve an additional USD three billion in funding.  In the second scenario, reduced quotas of subsidized gasoline would force consumption down by 10 percent and require an additional USD two billion in funding.  The last option would enact the proposed "targeted" subsidies and with the exception of cash payments would mean no more subsidized gasoline quotas. While the end of subsidies would best address Iran's bleak fiscal situation, it is difficult to determine where the funds for cash payments would come from or how much the administration is looking to spend on them.  On September 15, head of the State Headquarters for Management of Transportation and Fuel, General Mohammed Rouyanian tried to quell rumors that the government plans to cut the gasoline quota by half for the remainder of the year, announcing in state media, "the government has yet to take a decision."    KHAMENEI LIKES TARGETED SUBSIDIES    7. (C) While seemingly willing to offer alternatives, the government's intention seems to be to implement the same targeted subsidy program it introduced previously and for the new program to begin in the second half of the current Persian year.  The simultaneous release of the alternative options for gasoline subsidy reform with a statement by the Supreme Leader requesting that the government complete targeted subsidies in this term is an clear indication that the government plans to press hard on the issue, as is a recent statement by Ahmadinejad that he will seek passage of his subsidies bill at the start of Mehr month (September 22).  In a speech to the new cabinet on September 7, Supreme Leader Khamenei said, "Currently the government is paying fewer subsidies to the poor and paying more to the wealthy. Making the subsidies targeted, which has been mentioned, is truly an important measure."  He then complained that previous governments failed to enact such reforms and instructed the new cabinet to act, saying "Now, those governments have gone but you have to pursue such a thing."    COMMENT    8. (C) The government has wanted to eliminate the gasoline subsidy for years, the logic goes, because it is a large drain on revenues and encourages waste, but has feared the public backlash that would result.  In assessing the repercussions of Western gasoline sanctions against Iran, the strong consensus among informed IRPO contacts is that that gasoline sanctions would help Ahmadinejad politically, giving his administration the political cover it needs to eliminate subsidies and allowing the government to blame higher prices and less supply on the United States, while at the same time putting the country on a stronger financial footing.  It would also help to strengthen  DUBAI 00000382  003.2 OF 003   the IRIG financially by giving them another profitable source of black market profits.  END COMMENT. EYREA 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000384  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/17/2019 TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: QODS DAY BECOMES DOMESTIC BATTLEFRONT  DUBAI 00000384  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY:  This year's Qods Day - traditionally a government-orchestrated display of solidarity with Palestinians - has morphed into a domestic political contest in the wake of the disputed presidential election as oppositionists attempt to co-opt the sanctioned rallies by mobilizing their supporters in a show of strength.  The government has countered by substituting a hard-line cleric for the customary Qods Day leader Ayatollah Rafsanjani in order to maintain control of the message and suppress the participation of oppositionists.  There are clear indications that the government is fully prepared to violently suppress those who would defy the government's warning.  Though some analysts predict that the September 18 event will be a defining moment for the opposition, our contacts have asserted that it is more appropriately viewed as gauge of the opposition's ability to draw supporters back into the streets, particularly given Khatami and Karrubi's publicly declared intent to participate.  END SUMMARY.    2. (C) "International Jerusalem Day" - or Qods Day - was established by Islamic Republic founder Ayatollah Khomeini shortly after the Revolution as an annual expression of popular support for Palestinians and of venting anger toward Israel, cornerstones of Iranian foreign policy rhetoric since 1979.  As such, the government strongly encourages, and in some cases compels, participation.  Turn-out in Tehran alone typically numbers in the hundreds of thousands.  Since Khomeini's death in 1989 until this year, Rafsanjani has traditionally led the annual ceremony from the pulpit at Tehran University.    3. (C) In keeping with their tactic of using officially sanctioned public events as cover for bringing opposition supporters out in force, the key leaders associated with the "Green Path" opposition - Mousavi, Khatami, Karrubi and Grand Ayatollah Sanei - have all issued calls for massive participation, correctly anticipating that government would not risk losing face by canceling the event as they did with several earlier Ramadan ceremonies.  Supreme Leader Khamenei and Ahmadinejad are also exhorting people to attend in an attempt to use the expected large turn-out to claim 'victory' for the system, much as the 85 percent voter participation rate was heralded as a sweeping endorsement of the system.    4. (C) Following days of contradictory press reports, Iranian state radio confirmed September 16 that in a break with long-standing tradition, former President and current Expediency Council Chairman Ayatollah Rafsanjani will not lead Qods Day Friday Prayers on September 18.  Instead, hardliner Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami (no relation to former President Mohammad Khatami) will deliver the main sermon after opening remarks by President Ahmadinejad.  (NOTE: Ahmadinejad has delivered the preliminary remarks on Qods Day at least once before.)  This switch indicates that while poised to spin large turn-out in its favor, the ruling clique is trying in actuality to suppress participation of the opposition and maintain control of the message by sidelining Rafsanjani, who is aligned with the reformers.    5. (C) Other indications that the government is ready and willing to suppress any large-scale discontent from oppositionists tomorrow include reports that Basij units in the outskirts of Tehran are being mobilized and that sections of Tehran University campus are being cordoned off.  In the past twenty-four hours, the Revolutionary Guard and the police have issued a slew of warnings, promising harsh punishments for participants who are caught chanting "improper slogans."    6. (C) Many IRPO contacts are viewing Qods Day as a significant indicator of the opposition's ability to muster large-scale, visible support.  A prominent oppositionist based in Europe argued that streets full of protesters will not only buoy the movement but have the tangible benefit of preventing the arrest of Mehdi Karrubi. According to a Dubai-based analyst closely aligned with reformers inside Iran, many believe that the government is gearing up to increase repression of its opponents regardless of what transpires September 18.    DUBAI 00000384  002.2 OF 002    7. (C) COMMENT: The rhetorical tug-of-war over Qods Day has raised expectations that it could be a defining moment in the political struggle unleashed by the June 12 election.  The government's decision to remove Rafsanjani from the equation suggests that Khamenei is well aware of the scale of public discontent and loathe to give the opposition a pretext for massing against the government. Yet the regime has repeatedly proved itself willing to brutally - and effectively - suppress peaceful demonstrators.  With the opposition exhorting its supporters to turn out in defiance of the regime's warnings, Qods Day represents an important gauge of the opposition's resonance at the popular level.  For the leaders of the movement, the day could prove more fateful.  Significant unrest on the streets could give the hardliners agitating for the arrest of the opposition leaders the necessary pretext to make such a move, most likely against Karrubi, who is the most vulnerable and has promised to attend the Qods Day rally.  The fact that Rafsanjani will not speak at the main event in Tehran diminishes the likelihood that tomorrow will be a fateful day for his future role in IRIG.  END COMMENT. RICHARDSON

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Supreme Leader Khamenei and the IRIG have signaled their intention to move beyond the arrests of opposition figures and attack the perceived intellectual basis of the opposition.  This initiative seems to be at least a two-pronged approach -- limiting the ability of universities to inculcate anti-Islamic and anti-regime sentiment and warning Iran's artist community to stop use of  anti-regime themes in film and other media.   It appears that Iranian universities will open as scheduled, after earlier rumors they would not, and the IRIG is enhancing the security presence on Iranian campuses to prevent student protests. Moreover, the IRIG is also considering reviewing the humanities curriculum to ensure its compatibility with the Islamic Republic.  Some analysts and IRPO contacts are warning of a second Cultural Revolution that could include further efforts to purge the university system of liberal influences and increasing pressure on prominent artists to conform to IRIG-approved themes to further combat Western efforts of "soft overthrow."  End summary.    On Campus and in the Classroom  ----------------------------------    2. (C) The majority of Iran's universities are scheduled to open on September 23, though there was some earlier speculation that the beginning of classes may be delayed on the pretext of preventing  an outbreak of H1N1.  More recent indications are that universities will in fact open, but under a heavy security presence to include police and Baseejis highly visible on campus.  IRPO contacts have also noted that an undetermined number of students have already been expelled from universities for up to eight semesters for participating in protests or having links to the opposition.    3. (C) Beyond the immediate goal of preventing campuses from becoming a source of further unrest, the IRIG's longer term strategy appears to be to try to inoculate universities from exposure to the ideas that form the intellectual bases of the opposition.  In an August 30 speech to university professors and Baseej students , Ayatollayh Khamenei warned that the teaching of the social sciences and humanities that run counter to the ideals of the revolution and should be curtailed.  Khamenei said that the teaching of such sciences leads to "loss of belief in godly and Islamic knowledge" and to skepticism and doubt. Subsequent press reports have indicated the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council has begun considering revisions to the university curricula to limit teaching of the social sciences and humanities.  (Note: Iran's Cultural Revolution was an effort to rid Iranian universities of Western and other non-Islamic influence from 1980 to 1987.  At its outset, universities were closed for three years, and later, books were banned and students and faculty purged.)    4. (C) An Iranian academic now on a fellowship abroad, whose entry into the university had been delayed in the initial Cultural Revolution, told us that colleagues in Iran were worried over the prospects of clashes on campuses and faculty purges.  She said that it was near certain that the IRIG planned to take some action to tighten control over what is being taught in Iranian universities.  She added that liberal arts and social science teaching and research in Iran had never fully recovered after the First Cultural Revolution -- inadequate and outdated textbooks, lack of access to Western research, the loss of highly regarded professors who have never been replaced -- and further diminution of them now would cripple them inside Iran.    In the Theater and Gallery  --------------------------    5. (C) Simultaneously, the IRIG has also warned filmmakers and other artists about becoming involved in "soft overthrow" plots to prevent what it sees as inflammatory and destabilizing ideas from reaching the public.   Many of them openly supported Mousavi during the election, and in our meetings with them, have shown open contempt for the IRIG.  Khamenei met with several  DUBAI 00000385  002.2 OF 002   filmmakers, writers and other artists on September 15 to urge them to use their art to glorify the Sacred Defense (the Iran-Iraq War) and its values of epic struggle, piety, idealism, altruism, resistance, and  wisdom.  According to one account we heard, director Majid Majidi, whose film "Children of Heaven" was nominated for an Oscar and who directed Mousavi's campaign video, complained to Khamenei about the "oppression" of artists after the election.  An Iranian filmmaker based in the UAE told us that several filmmakers who supported reformist candidates are now on an IRIG blacklist  and said Khamenei's message to artists in his speech was a warning  to promote IRIG-approved themes or else.  Another IRPO contact who fled Iran after being arrested for making a critical documentary about the post-election unrest, told us fear of arrest and torture had grown throughout the arts community.    Comment  ----------    6. (C)  Not content with forcing the opposition off the streets, the IRIG now appears to be trying to get at what it sees as the intellectual basis of the opposition movement.  This root cause of the criticism of the regime, in the IRIG's collective mind, is promulgated in the teaching of liberal, Western humanities and the political commentary hidden within works of art. Students, intellectuals and artists remain some of the most vehement critics of the regime, and it appears that the IRIG is now taking further steps keep them in check, promising a long-term struggle.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: Tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched in Iran's Qods Day celebrations on September 18, defying government threats that anti-government protesters would be dealt with severely. Despite the warnings and significant efforts by the state to prevent large-scale anti-government gatherings, demonstrators marched freely through major urban centers across Iran.  Notably, the response of the security forces was muted compared to earlier demonstrations: widespread clashes were not reported, and relatively few people seem to have been arrested.  Additionally, the key leadership figures associated with the "Green Path" opposition - Mousavi, Karrubi, and Khatami - took to the streets briefly, ending speculation they would be denied freedom of movement by the government. Expediency Council head Ayatollah Rafsanjani, who had been removed from his post as Qods Day prayer leader by the government in an attempt to control the day's message (reftel), was also seen in the streets, with unconfirmed reports he was marching with protesters. In the on-going political struggle, Qods Day is best characterized as a draw rather than a defining moment for either side: the opposition demonstrated its resilience by bringing significant numbers to the street, but the government declined to raise the temperature by taking provocative steps such as brutally suppressing demonstrators or arresting opposition leaders.  END SUMMARY.    IRIG Ensures Official Qods Day Events Uninterrupted    2. (C) Qods Day's official events went as planned with Ahmadinejad delivering a fiery pre-sermon speech alongside speeches by Islamic Movement of Palestine leader Ramezan Abdullah and hardline cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami. Ahmadinejad tried to rally support for Palestine by labeling the Holocaust a lie and a pretext for the founding of Israel, and by blaming Europe for the start of anti-Semitism, as well as claiming the "Zionists" manipulated Western governments.  The event was well orchestrated by the IRIG; state television showed Ahmadinejad delivering his speech before thousands of his supporters and there were no signs of the opposition protests taking place throughout Iran.  There are reports that the government bussed in its supporters from throughout the country and also used busses to block access to the Friday prayer grounds, preventing the opposition from disrupting the day's officially sanctioned speeches.    3. (C) Predictably, Iran's security forces were out in large numbers; but, despite the IRGC's repeated warnings to the opposition against demonstrating on Qods Day, the security forces largely refrained from direct clashes with the protesters.  Opposition marches took place in several cities after months of a severe crackdown that prevented even small groups from assembling. Video and photos purportedly taken during Qods Day rallies show the security forces standing by as protests continue. The confrontations that did occur were relatively minor in comparison with the clashes immediately following the election.  The Commander of the Law Enforcement forces in Tehran said some "trouble-makers" were arrested; otherwise, reformist websites have reported some clashes later in the day, the use of tear gas to disperse some crowds, and the arrest of some wearing green in Mashad.  We have not seen reports of protesters injured or killed.    Opposition Leaders in the Streets    4. (C) Mousavi, Karrubi, and Khatami each briefly participated in marches in Tehran, debunking widespread rumors in the days leading up to September 18 that they had been placed under virtual house arrest.  Photographers documented government supporters jostling former President Khatami while he was marching, knocking off his turban before his security team was able to lead him away.  There are similar reports that Mousavi and Karrubi were also forced by thugs to leave marches prematurely.  Reformist media carried reports that the harassment of the three was coordinated.  (NOTE: This physical intimidation is not a new tactic.  Karrubi's turban was knocked off by pro-government thugs in a similar incident in July, and Khatami was also roughed up at a campaign event earlier in the  DUBAI 00000386  002.2 OF 002   year before he withdrew from the presidential race. END NOTE)    5. (C) Protests occurred in many cities; media and reformist websites have reported protests in Tehran, Mashad, Rasht, Tabriz, Shiraz, Esfahan, Bushehr, Kerman, Ahvaz, and, Yazd. The scale of the protests is unclear. BBC Farsi reported tens of thousands of protesters in Tehran and other cities while others suggest the number of protesters was higher.  However, the government strictly enforced its ban on press coverage of protests, leaving the true level of participation subject to speculation based on anecdotal information.  Reformist and other websites have also reported that protesters were closer enough to Ahmadinejad during a post-speech interview that shouts of "Resign!" were heard in the background, and that the IRIB was forced to broadcast an evening soccer match in black and white because of the large number green-wearing spectators.  There are also reports, however, that the number of government supporters outnumbered the opposition, likely reflecting the government's oft-used tactic of bussing in supporters. The reports collectively indicate that although there protests were widespread, the protests immediately after the elections were much larger than the crowds that turned out on Qods Day.    6. (C) COMMENT:  The opposition successfully demonstrated that popular anger over the disputed presidential election has not diminished despite its brutal suppression of earlier protests and well-publicized horrific treatment of detainees.  Yet government restraint on Qods Day should not be seen as a strategic shift away from suppression toward compromise; rather, the IRIG likely calculated that tolerating muted displays of dissent on the streets was preferable to provoking a new round of international criticism over violence against protesters in advance of President Ahmadinejad's imminent trip to New York and the October 1 negotiations with the P5+1 powers. The government now though is likely to re-assert its control of Iran's streets to prevent the opposition from staging additional protests. In addition, with no significant public holidays in the near future to co-opt, the opposition will have to find a new way to express popular discontent. In the near term, we believe that the government will continue to carefully weigh its options to neutralize the "Green Path" opposition's key leaders in seeking to restore domestic political stability.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000389  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/24/2019 TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: IRAN: CLERICAL CONFAB STIFFS RAFSANJANI FOR SUPREME LEADER  REF: RPO DUBAI 384  DUBAI 00000389  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyer, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: Oppositionist hopes that Iran's clerical class would mobilize to oppose Supreme Leader Khamenei's post-election policies appear sharply diminished in the wake of the first Assembly of Experts meeting since the June 12 Presidential election. Not only did the Assembly, which has the power to appoint, supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, give a ringing endorsement of Khamenei's rule and his handling of the post-election crisis, it did so in the conspicuous absence of its Chair, Ayatollah Rafsanjani.  Moreover, leaks of the closed-door proceedings to the conservative press indicate that at least two prominent members of this clerical deliberative body excoriated Rafsanjani for his failure to support Khamenei during the unrest.  Despite his absence at the closure of the Assembly of Experts meeting, Rafsanjani was compelled to publicly endorse the closing statement while seated at the knee of the Supreme Leader during a September 24 press conference. END SUMMARY.    Assembly of Experts: A 'Deliberative' Body    2 (C) The Majles-e Khobregan, or Assembly of Experts (AOE), is a Constitutionally-mandated deliberative body composed of 86 directly-elected senior clerics from across the country.  By law, the Assembly must meet for a minimum of two days twice a year.  Though theoretically vested with the power to appoint, supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, in practical terms the Assembly's only real responsibility is to appoint the Supreme Leader's successor should he die or become incapacitated.  As such, the AOE's last noteworthy act was appointing current Supreme Leader Khamenei after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 death.  Every subsequent meeting has ended with the issuance of a perfunctory statement lauding the Assembly's decision to appoint Khamenei and praising his leadership. Nevertheless, according to Article 111 of the Constitution, the Assembly can find Khamenei unfit for office; accordingly, control of the AOE remains a (potential) check on the Supreme Leader's otherwise unbridled power.    3. (C) The Assembly is currently chaired by Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was re-elected to the two-year term of Speaker in March 2009.  At the time of his re-election, he garnered 51 votes, an improvement over the 46 votes he received in 2007, despite efforts by hardline conservative clerics, led by Ayatollahs Mesbah-Yazdi and Ibrahim Yazdi, to unseat him.    First Meeting since the Election    4. (C) On September 22-23 the AOE convened for the first time since Iran's disputed June 12 election.  Rafsanjani opened the sixth official meeting of this Fourth Assembly of Experts by again cautioning that a "suspicious faction" is trying to create rifts among Iran's leaders and by condemning the "atmosphere of insults and dispute" that has prevailed since the June presidential election.  He also promised that "system insiders of good will" are developing a plan to resolve Iran's domestic political problems. His opening statement was followed by reports to the body by Judiciary deputy Mohsen Ejei (Intelligence Minister during the presidential election and its aftermath) and Revolutionary Guards Commander Jaafari. According to press reports, at least sixteen Assembly members spoke.    5. (C) Though summaries of the closed-door proceedings released by Rafsanjani's office did not reflect any discord among the members and indeed indicated the body's support of him, conservative Iranian press charged Rafsanjani's office with 'censoring' coverage of the proceeding, reporting that at least two prominent members sharply criticized Rafsanjani for failing to support the Supreme Leader after the disputed election.  One quotation prominently featured in conservative news outlets was Mashhad Friday Prayer Leader Ayatollah al-Hoda rhetorically asking Rafsanjani, "why after twenty years, have you remained silent in the face of these unprecedented insults (to the Supreme Leader)?"  DUBAI 00000389  002.2 OF 002      6. (C) More tellingly, Rafsanjani did not attend the second and final day of the meeting, with recently retired former Judiciary Head Ayatollah Shahrudi chairing in his absence. Hardline conservative Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami (the same cleric who replaced Rafsanjani as Qods Day prayer leader - reftel) read the Assembly's final statement, which was an unqualified if not fawning endorsement of the Supreme Leader himself and his "wise policies" for quickly extinguishing the post-election "flames of sedition."  Khatami noted that Rafsanjani, despite his absence, agreed with "every point" of the final statement, which also credited Khamenei for dismissing the fraud allegations as part of a plot to undermine the Islamic Republic.  The final statement was also noteworthy in its perfunctory congratulations to President Ahmadinejad for his election victory, and its more sincere admonishment of Ahmadinejad to scrupulously follow Supreme Leader Khamenei's guidance.    7. (C) COMMENT: Following the disputed June 12 presidential election, many speculated that the axis of a Rafsanjani counter-attack would focus on rallying clerical support to his cause. However, the rumored AOE "emergency session" never convened, and absent such a meeting it remained unclear how much support Rafsanjani had among this body that reflects the political leanings of Iran's traditional senior clergy.  Now that the AOE has met, it is clear that the clerical cavalry isn't coming over the horizon anytime soon.  Furthermore, the AOE final statement, seen in conjunction with the removal of Rafsanjani as Qods Day Speaker (reftel), indicates in the clearest terms yet that in the most severe crisis of his career, Rafsanjani is unable to mobilize his once vast and influential patronage network to achieve his political ends.  And given that Rafsanjani's presumed power is serving as at least a partial deterrent to further regime moves against Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami, the results of this two-day AOE session bode ill for the leadership of the oppositionist "Green Path of Hope."

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Iranian media and public statements by officials have maintained the IRIG's official line that the IRIG has not only not violated the NPT, but has gone beyond its IAEA obligations in its early disclosure of  the second uranium enrichment facility near Qom.  President Ahmadinejad, and the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) Ali Akbar Salehi, IAEA Perm Rep Ali Asghar Soltanieh, and Majlis speaker Ali Larijani have all  been heavily quoted in asserting the correctness of Iran's action and in discrediting Western claims that Iran has been caught cheating, while an editorial in hardline conservative daily Kayhan claimed Western allegations were a ploy to increase pressure on Iran heading into negotiations with the P5+1.  Not surprisingly, the IRIG is highlighting the correctness of its actions while accusing the West of lacking goodwill on the eve of negotiations.  End summary.    2. (C) Initial Iranian reaction to September 25 Western press reports of  the existence of a second planned enrichment facility seemed rushed, perhaps because the story broke on a Friday, Iran's weekend.  On early  Friday afternoon Tehran time, there were official Iranian press accounts of "an informed official" confirming Western press accounts of this site.  Late r that afternoon the AEOI read a brief statement over the phone from its President Ali Akbar Salehi to Iranian press confirming that such a facility was being built "within the framework of IAEA regulations," and congratulating Supreme Leader Khamenei and the Iranian people for this latest step in the development of Iran's nuclear industry.     3. (C) In the days following, Iranian press has given significant coverage to the revelation that Iran is constructing a second nuclear enrichment facility near Qom.  The IRIG message has been consistent: Iran has given the IAE notification of the facility a year before it is required to do so, stressing its interpretation that notification is not necessary until six months before fissile material is introduced into the facility. Since September 25, while Ahmadinejad was granting interviews in New York, the IRIG's talking points have tracked closely with Ahmadinejad's initial response to Western reporters' questions over the facility's existence.   MFA spokesman Hassan Qashqavi, in his weekly press conference September 28, asserted that the installation was "completely legal" and that allegations Iran had been caught red handed were no more than propaganda.  The facility's purpose, Qashqavi said, was in keeping with the peaceful purposes of Iran's nuclear program but was necessary to "protect" Iran's achievements in developing nuclear technology.    4. (C) Salehi appeared on Iranian television news programs and was quoted extensively by print and internet media as highlighting Iran's transparency in providing notification to the IAEA well before it was required and stressing that the site was a part of Iran's peaceful nuclear energy program.  Salehi told news agency ISNA September 26 that Western claims that the Iranians had tried to hide the facility were lies meant to deceive world opinion about the peaceful nature of Iran's program.  In a television interview September 27, Salehi repeated earlier statements that the facility, when it was operational, would not enrich uranium above five percent level needed for nuclear power generation.  He said that the facility was intended as a backup for the work already begun at Natanz. He, along with IAEA Perm Rep Soltanieh, have stressed that the IAEA has "officially thanked" the IRIG for its disclosure of the site.    5. (C) In a September 27  interview with ISNA Secretary of the National Security Council Saeed Jalili, warned that the US, France and Britain, in their manner of announcing the facility's existence, threatened to repeat previous mistakes in attempting to negotiate with Iran.  Jalili said the allegations were a repetition of the 'carrot and stick' approach that sought to pressure Iran into suspending its enrichment program.  Jalili added that Iran's disclosure had been a act of transparency to show goodwill on the verge of negotiations.   Likewise, Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani in an September 27 interview said that despite repeated Western allegations against Iran, it remained ready for negotiations.  The West sought continuously to impose its will on Iran, and knowing that it could not, now sought to  DUBAI 00000393  002.2 OF 002   create suspicion over Iran's actions.    6. (C), In a September 27  editorial hardline  conservative daily Kayhan dismissed claims that Western intelligence agencies had detected the site and forced Iran to acknowledge its existence.  To the contrary, Kayhan wrote, Iran had voluntarily notified the IAEA, and now Western powers sought to use Iran's good faith for leverage in the upcoming negotiations.    7. (C) Comment: Statements by Iranian officials concerning Western press accounts of its second enrichment site are all 'on message' and reflect the talking points that Iran disclosed this facility long before it had to under its IAEA obligations, and that Iran is surprised by Western mis-character ization of Iran's motivations and actions, which it takes as further evidence of a lack of goodwill on behalf of the West.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 27 the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC)-affiliated 'Etemaad-e Mobin Consortium' (EMC) bought a 50 percent plus one share stake in the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI) for an amount equivalent to USD 7.8 billion.  The sale, the largest in the Tehran Stock Exchange's history, is consistent with other recent 'privatizations' under President Ahmadinejad which have transferred ownership of state assets from the government to quasi-public sector institutes, often the IRGC. While there was strong foreign and domestic interest in this TCI tender, Iran's Privatization Organization (PO) engineered the pre-sale qualifications such that ultimately only two IRGC-affiliated consortia were competing. The government's sale of a majority stake in the country's largest telecommunications provider to the IRGC serves both to consolidate control of a strategic sector in IRGC hands while also assuring it of substantial profits in the years ahead.  END SUMMARY    TELEPHONE MONOPOLY, A PROFITABLE BUSINESS IN IRAN    2. (U) Originally the Telephone Company of Iran, TCI was re-structured in 2005 and reorganized as a parent company overseeing 33 subsidiaries including data, mobile, and backbone communications' providers.  TCI has a complete monopoly on the fixed-line (landline and wired broadband) business in Iran.  In its last annual report (September 2008), TCI reported 24.3 million fixed-lines in service as well as 27.8 million mobile subscribers (90 percent of the market).  As such, it is a highly profitable company with significant growth potential.    3. (U) In July 2006 Supreme Leader Khamenei decreed that a renewed effort be made to privatize the economy, and TCI's privatization has been under discussion since 2007.  Since that time many foreign companies had expressed interest and pursued the possibility of investing in TCI.  However, most foreign investors ultimately withdrew because of revised privatization rules intended to prevent substantial foreign and or private ownership and to favor domestic investors with government connections.    4. (C) In early September a major Iranian telecommunications investor told IRPO that PO actions geared to limit private-sector interest indicted government intent to facilitate IRGC purchase of TCI.  He cited other recent privatizations where qualifications were structured to limit the pool to only 'qualified' IRGC front companies.  This investor cited his own situation, in which government pressure resulted in his company losing the right to represent MTN (the only foreign company to successfully obtain a mobile license to operate in Iran) to an IRGC front-company.    RIGGING THE FIELD    5. (C) As a result of heavy government pre-qualification of potential TCI purchasers there were ultimately only three bidders, two of whom were associated with the IRGC:    - ETEMAD-e MOBIN CONSORTIUM: The winning consortium, composed of three companies 'Gostaresh-e Electronic-e Mobin' (46 percent), 'Towse'eh Etemad' Company (46 percent) and 'Shahryar-e Mahestan' company (eight percent).  The first two of these companies are subordinate to the IRGC Cooperatives Foundation ('Bonyad-e Ta'avon-e Sepah-e Pasdaran'), while the third company is owned by another parastatal organization, the 'Headquarters for Executing the Imam's Dictates' ('Setad-e Ejrai-ye Farman-e Imam').    - MEHR INVESTMENT COMPANY CONSORTIUM: The losing IRGC-affiliated  DUBAI 00000394  002.2 OF 002   consortium, composed of the Mehr Investment Company (affiliated with the Basij), the Social Security Investment Company ('Sherkat-e Sarmayehgozari-ye Tamin-e Ejtemai,' aka 'Shasta.'), and 'Sa Iran' a contracting company for MODAFL communications projects.    - PISHGAMAN KAVIR YAZD COOOPERATIVE GROUP (PKY):  The only non-IRGC-related company involved in the tender, it was established in 1996 and is composed of 15 investment and cooperative companies.  A few hours before the September 27 tender it was disqualified from competition for undisclosed security reasons, despite having previously been approved for competition in the tender.    6. (C) An IRPO contact who invests heavily in the Tehran Stock Exchange said he and a number of private investors he knows invested in a five percent TCI offering when it was made available last year, predicting that future ownership would be in IRGC hands.  Asked why, he said "we have to make money and government involvement in market manipulation ensures that the share price will go up." (COMMENT: the TCI tender price was almost double the current price, giving current TCI shareholders a substantial bonus  END COMMENT).  Asked about the impact of the IRGC purchase on the long-term business environment, he said that while private-sector investment would be ideal, maintaining government ownership is preferable to selling to the IRGC, adding "at least with government, we know who the owner is and where the money is going.  With the IRGC, you don't even know."    7. (C) COMMENT: The government's sale of a majority stake in the country's largest telecommunication provider to the IRGC serves to both consolidate control of a strategic sector in the hands of the IRGC while also assuring it of substantial profits in the years ahead.  While the government has made much of its privatization effort as the focus of its economic liberalization policies, this latest effort demonstrates the hollowness fo the effort.  While government institutions and some wealthy investors will benefit in the short-term from insider trading that shifts ownership among government-affiliated entities, the long-term prospect for telecommunications, once considered Iran's most-promising market, is severely diminished. Meanwhile, this 'historic' tender is but the latest example of the IRGC's ongoing expansion into mainstream commercial activities.  To this end, the IRGC is soon set to have its own bank (upcoming septel).  END COMMENT. EYRE

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)   1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 28 an estimated two thousand students dressed in green marched through the University of Tehran chanting "death to the dictator" as senior IRIG officials, including the controversial Higher Education Minister, were heckled while entering a (closed to students) ceremony on campus to mark the start of the academic year. Similarly, reformist websites report that on September 29 several hundred students at Sharif University in Tehran chanted slogans against the government after being barred from a similar ceremony attended by the Higher Education Minister. Preventive measures by the government, including widespread pre-term expulsions of politically active students and warnings that protests would not be tolerated, appear to have suppressed but not eliminated overt expressions of dissent on campus. END SUMMARY.   Tehran University  2. (C) Though conservative news agencies downplayed the numbers, footage posted on the Internet corroborates reformist reports that on September 28 an estimated two thousand students dressed in green and carrying green balloons and banners denouncing the "coup d'etat government" and shouting slogans against the Ahmadinejad government marched through Tehran University's campus September 28 in defiance of an absolute ban on political activity at universities. Smaller numbers of pro-government students also shouted slogans, but the two groups did not physically clash. The commotion led the police to close the gates to the school to prevent passers-by from joining the march. Though some reformist websites reported at least two students were arrested upon leaving campus, the police apparently did not enter the campus.  3. (C) The protest march coincided with the on-campus ceremony to officially mark the opening of the academic year. Though President Ahmadinejad declined to attend for the second year in a row, senior IRIG officials including Higher Education Minister Kamran Daneshju and Health Minister Marzieh Dastjerdi were present. Photos from the event show no university-age individuals, giving credence to the rumor that students were barred from the ceremony. (NOTE: Daneshju, who oversaw the June 12 presidential election as Deputy Interior Minister, was recently accused of plagiarism by Nature magazine, and claims to have a doctoral degree from a non-existent British university. END NOTE).  4. (C) A day earlier on September 27, conservative MP and university professor Gholam Hadad-Adel was mocked by a small group (approximately 50, according to a reformist website) of jeering students when he sought to move around Tehran University. Haddad-Adel, who is related to the Supreme Leader by marriage, was barred from exiting the campus until he could add additional security to his entourage. Reformist websites quote a flustered Haddad Adel at the scene as saying to his security, 'you told me it was safe here,' 'why don't they respect university professors?..if university professors aren't respected, then nothing is.'   Sharif University  5. (C) On September 29 unrest spread to Tehran's Sharif University during the school's own opening ceremony, also attended by Higher Education Minister Daneshju. Videos posted to the internet show several hundred students chanting slogans in support of reformist Grand Ayatollahs Montazeri and Sanaei, and calling on Ahmadinejad's "coup government" to resign. The Sharif protest appeared more spontaneous than the organized Tehran University march. As yet, there are no reports of the government's response to the students' actions.  6. (C) COMMENT: Dynamics on the campuses of Iran's two premier universities, each with long histories of incubating student political activism, appear to generally reflect the status of the larger opposition movement: though relatively small groups of protestors can garner outside attention and be a thorn in the side of officials, at this point the scale is unlikely to threaten university operations or provoke significant clashes with security forces. Should the government feel threatened, however, no doubt it has the means to increase the severity of its counter-measures, to include closing campuses under the pretext of H1N1 prevention.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: On the eve of negotiations with the US and other P5+1 members, Iranian officials insisted that they will neither surrender the country's nuclear rights nor bow to threats of further sanctions.  Iranian officials balanced these uncompromising statements with expressions of Iran's goodwill and optimism for  the negotiations, so long as they conform to the framework Iran has proposed.  Iranian officials continue to stay on message in laying out Iran's position, giving little indication they are prepared to offer concessions and underscoring that they want negotiations to play out on their terms. End summary.    2. (C) Several statements by Iranian officials September 28 and 29 offered no last-minute changes in Iran's position in approaching its negotiations with the P5+1.  Iranian officials continued to stress that Iran's "inalienable" right to nuclear technology is not up for discussion.   Foreign Minister Manocher Mottaki, speaking to the press in New York after a meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, said Iran would not concede its right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Iranian Atomic Energy Organization chief Ali Akhbar Salehi told hard-line, conservative daily Kayhan September 29 that the newly acknowledged site near Qom was a clear indication of Iran's determination not to suspend uranium enrichment .  "If we have the right to enrich uranium and convert it to produce fuel [for a reactor], we will accomplish this," he said.  (NOTE: Salehi said discussions with the IAEA over access to the second site were continuing but no timetable for inspections had been agreed.  END NOTE).    3. (C) Iranian PermRep to the IAEA Ali Asghar Soltanieh told Al Jazeera, in an interview picked up by Iranian website Rajanews September 30, that the only basis for negotiations in Geneva was the Iranian proposal passed to the P5+1.  Pressed to elaborate, Soltanieh said Iran would not discuss its nuclear activities, but that Iran would be open to discussion of nuclear proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy as global issues.  Asked about the threat of further sanctions if negotiations fail, Soltanieh said Iran would not be intimidated, and attempts to use sanctions as a stick to compel Iran to change its behavior would be fruitless.    4. (C) Separately, in a show of unity with the government, 239 of 290 deputies in the Majlis signed a statement September 29 urging the P5+1 not to repeat past mistakes and take advantage of a "historic opportunity" to conduct talks within the framework of Iran's September 9 proposal.  Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Alaedin Boroujerdi said September 28 that Iran would not accept suspension of enrichment as a condition for negotiations, while MP Hassan Ghafourifard September 29 suggested that Iran withdraw from the NPT if the West persisted in trying to force it to stop its development of nuclear technology.    5. (C) National Security Council Secretary and chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, before departing for Geneva September 29, told ISNA that he was approaching the negotiations with a positive attitude and goodwill.   Jalili said that the negotiations presented both sides with an opportunity for security and stability in the region "based on peace and justice," as well as making progress in other areas of concern to the international community and Iran.    6. (C) Comment: Iranian officials continue to stay on message (reftel) in laying out Iran's position for negotiations in Geneva, giving little indication they are prepared to offer concessions while putting the onus on the P5+1 to accept the Iranian framework as the basis for discussion.  While the Iranians seem to be making some last-minute goodwill gestures, such as granting consular access to the detained American hikers and the reported release of other detainees, these should not be seen as a softening of Iran's  position on the nuclear issue.  DUBAI 00000398  002.2 OF 002   In our view, the tone of these most recent statements continues to suggest that Iran wants to be, at a minimum, seen as an equal and accorded respect before it comes face-to-face with the US and its partners.   Simultaneously, the Iranian public  posture also seems to be laying the groundwork for Iran to absolve itself of any blame should negotiations fail. RICHARDSON

This cable repeats ref e-mail.    2. Inititial Iranian press coverage of the P5+1 negotiations in Geneva and the bilateral meeting between U/S Burns and Iranian negotiator Jalili has been factual, without editorial comment. Coverage in the sources we checked was positive, drawing on statements by Jalili and EU Representative Solana during the post-negotiation press conference in characterizing the meeting.  The President's statement and the Secretary's remarks were also reported by some Iranian media.    3. Jalili's comments that Iran has not surrendered it's nuclear rights, that it has called for global nuclear disarmament, and that its proposed framework for negotiations was the basis for talks was reported extensively.  The moderate Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) led its story on Jalili's press conference with his statement that negotiations would continue.  It also reported his characterization of the negotiations as positive and based on dialogue in areas of common interest.  Ayande News and other outlets reported Iran's agreement to allow IAEA inspectors access to the newly disclosed second uranium enrichment facility near Qom and the agreement to further enrich Iranian uranium outside Iran for use in Iran's research reactor, quoting Solana.    4. Tabnak, which is owned by Expediency Council Secretary and former presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaei, quoted a British Foreign Office spokesman contradicting Iranian claims that its framework had been agreed, while noting Jalili's statements on Iran's nuclear rights and the need for global disarmament. Opposition website Rahesabz reported that while some state media had hailed Iran's assertion of its rights, Western media had focused on Iran's agreement to inspections at Qom and acceptance of enrichment outside the country in a story headlined, "Geneva Talks: Iran's Retreat, Western Optimism."    5. The centrist Iran Labor News Agency (ILNA) ran a separate story on the President's statement.  It quoted him as saying that the Geneva meeting was a constructive beginning but that Iran must take practical steps to make its nuclear activities more transparent and to cooperate with the IAEA and international community.  ILNA also reported the President's warning that Iran would face increased pressure if it was not more forthcoming.  Rahesabz reported the President's remarks, including US support for Iran's right to nuclear energy and the US commitment to negotiations, as well as his comment that the US is not interested in talking for the sake of talking. Semi-official, right-wing Fars News, which has ties to the IRGC, quoted the Secretary's comment that the talks were constructive but that Iran needed to take observable actions toward meeting the international community's concerns.    6. Iranian press gave considerable coverage to the bilateral meeting between U/S Burns and Jalili.  While little coverage went beyond the Department's announcement that the meeting had taken place, Tabnak noted that unlike Iran's previous discussions on the nuclear issue, this time it was face-to-face with the US.  Rahesabz described the meeting as "unprecedented."  Rajanews, which is thought to be affiliated with President Ahmadinejad, also reported that the meeting had occurred.    7.  Editorial comment will likely come over the next several days.  Most Iranian news organizations do not publish on Friday, and the IRIG is likely in the process of determining the tone of editorials in state-run and semi-official media.  EYRE 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000409  SIPDIS  DEPT PLS PASS TO DEPT OF TREAS BRIAN GRANT, JASON WEISS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  10/5/2019 TAGS: ECON, IR, PGOV, PREL SUBJECT: IRAN: IRGC ACQUIRES BANK LICENSES  REF: RPO DUBAI 394  DUBAI 00000409  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DoS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) recently approved bank licenses (one preliminarily) for two financial institutions affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Cors (IRGC), Ansar Finance and Credit Institute (AFCI) and Mehr Finance and Credit Institute (MFCI).  The licenses allow the two to formally offer retail and investment banking facilities throughout Iran. Though the CBI has authorized both licenses under the rubric of privatization, the licenses mark the entry of IRGC as a new parastatal player in Iran's banking sector.  With national branch, ATM, and point-of-sale infrastructure already in place as well as strong capital backing, these new banks are poised to grow their portfolios rapidly.  As a result, the IRGC will be able to fortify its advantage in raising capital for affiliated businesses, extend its influence into non-IRGC sectors of the economy through investment banking, and perhaps increase access to funds transfer facilities.  END SUMMARY.    2. (SBU) In an August 24 2009 meeting, the CBI's Money and Credit Council authorized a license for AFCI (and two other institutions) to formally begin banking operations.  The approvals increase the number of 'private' banks in Iran from six to nine.  Additionally, the CBI governor Mahmoud Bahmani announced that the Central Bank was reviewing an additional 40 applications, preliminarily approving one for MFCI.  As of January 2009, 'private' banks account for 18.7 percent of total banking sector assets (USD 438 billion), having only passed the 10 percent mark in November 2006.    FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS    3. (C) After the Islamic Revolution, Ansar Loan Union Fund (Sanduq-e Qarz ol-Hasaneh Ansar') and Basij Loan Union Fund ('Sanduq-e Qarz ol-Hasaneh Basjian') were established as two non-banking financial institutions with the mandate to provide interest-free loans ('qarz ol-hasaneh') to those IRGC and Basij members who fought in the Iran-Iraq War and their families. (NOTE: Qarz ol-hasaneh, a type of transaction that forbids a financial institution to charge interest under Islamic law became the de facto means of taking deposits and issuing loans when the banking system was nationalized after the Islamic Revolution. END NOTE).  These two funds operated under this limited charter for twenty years.    NOT YOUR FATHER'S CREDIT UNION    4. (C) In October 2006, in Ahmadinejad's first term, the CBI licensed the two IRGC affiliated Loan Union Funds (LUFs) to operate as Finance and Credit Institutes (FCIs).  Though the new approval gave the institutions the authority to operate more like retail banks, under CBI regulations their offerings were still limited.  Both FCIs expanded aggressively though and sometimes outside of their authority.  As one Dubai-based political analyst who highlighted the noticeable support to these particular FCIs said, "Under Khatami, it was policy to keep the IRGC and bonyads (parastatal foundations with  a strong, presence in Iran's economy) out of oil and banking. Under Ahmadinejad, there was a decision to grant them licenses and push them forward."  Today, these FCIs are quite large:    ANSAR FINANCE AND CREDIT INSTIUTE (AFCI) has about 5,000 employees staffing 600 branches with 300 ATMs throughout the country.  It claims to have more than 5.5 million registered accounts with with 65 percent of that dedicated to qarz ol-hasaneh offerings (loans and fixed deposits).    MEHR FINANCE AND CREDIT INSTITUTE (MFCI) changed its name from 'Basijian' to 'Mehr' when the CBI authorized it to become an FCI, though its affiliation the Basij para-military  DUBAI 00000409  002.2 OF 002   organization, under the command of the IRGC, remains in place. The organization currently claims to have 700 branches and 215 ATMs.    5. (C) In the last three years, Ansar and Mehr grew rapidly, acting as pseudo-banks, involved both in retail and investment banking.  (NOTE: Both have accumulated large amounts of capital though there are conflicting accounts of the absolute total assets of each bank.  According to CBI regulation, a bank license requires an institution to have at least USD 2 billion in capital. END NOTE).  Most of that revenue was accumulated through investment banking and fixed deposit transactions. According to press reports, public records indicate that MFCI purchased stock in the following Tehran Stock Exchange-traded companies: Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI) (reftel), Mobarakeh Steel, Iran Tractor Manufacturing Company, Iran Marine Industrial Company ('Sadra'), Technostar Engineering, Iran Aluminum Company ('IRALCO'), and Jaber Ebne Haygen Pharmaceuticals.  Additionally, as reported reftel, Mehr Investment Company, one of the two consortiums that bid on the recent TCI tender, included MFCI as a partner.    IRGC: THE GRIP THAT KEEPS ON GRIPPING    6. (C) In addition to being able to now offer the full range of retail bank services (including checking and savings), bank licensing may also provide AFCI and MFCI a new channel to access state funds.  During Ahmadinejad's tenure, under political pressure from the administration the CBI has provided loans to state banks for further distribution to the population under the guise of small business lending programs.  Most of these loans have gone bad, and as a result the total debt of Iran's 11 state banks to the CBI is in excess of USD 32 billion.  As licensed banks, AFCI and MFCI will also qualify for similar CBI credit allowing them to grow assets and further capitalize their retail and investment banking operations, ultimately extending their reach in various economic sectors.    7. (C) COMMENT: While AFCI and MFCI started operating some banking facilities in the absence of a license, this new formal endorsement by the Central Bank means that the IRGC will have the ability to broaden and deepen its economic presence.  It can use the banks to obtain partial ownership in large, publicly traded businesses through its investments as well as take stakes in small to medium enterprises through retail banking. As a result, the IRGC will be able to fortify its advantage in raising capital for affiliated businesses, extend its influence into non-IRGC sectors of the economy through investment banking, and perhaps increase access to funds transfer facilities.  END COMMENT. EYREA

In a move assumed by Iranian press to be related, on October 4 Supreme Leader Khamenei announced four high-level personnel changes within the IRGC, including appointing Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi Basij Forces Commander.  His predecessor, hardline conservative Hojjatoleslam Hossein Ta'eb, is reportedly being transferred to the IRGC Intelligence branch, although that transfer has not been confirmed.  If in fact the Basij is integrated within the IRGC Ground Forces, it would be the second phase of an IRGC re-organization conceived by its Commander, Major General Mohammad Ali Jaafari. END SUMMARY.    2. (C) On October 4 Supreme Leader Khamenei announced the following four high level military appointments:    -Basij Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi, as commander of the Basij Forces;    -IRGC Brigadier Mohammad Hoseynzadeh Hejazi, as Deputy Commander for Logistics, Support and Industrial Research, Armed Forces General Staff;    -IRGC Brigadier General Hossein Salami, as IRGC Deputy Commander; and,    -IRGC Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, as Commander, IRGC Aerospace Force.    3. (C) According to unconfirmed Iranian press reports, former Basij Commander Hojjatoleslam Hossein Ta'eb will be made deputy of the IRGC Intelligence Branch.  Also according to unconfirmed reports, Director of the Armed Forces General Staff Major General Hassan Firouzabadi is to be replaced, although his office has denied the report.    4. (C) New Basij commander Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi first became prominent in approximately 1997 at the start of the Khatami administration, when he was the head of the Intelligence Security ("hefazat-e ettela'at") Section of the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF).  At that time reformist forces aligned with then-President Khatami accused him of torturing imprisoned Tehran Deputy Mayors during the investigation and subsequent prosecution of then-Tehran Mayor Karbaschi.  Naqdi was subsequently tried and found guilty in a military court for these offenses and given a three-month sentence.  However this sentence was never implemented, and a few months after his removal from the LEF he was appointed as a military advisor to Supreme Leader Khamenei.    5. (C) Naqdi was also among the IRGC generals to have signed a letter pointedly directing President Khatami to resolve the 1999 student protests lest the IRGC remove him from power.  When Ahmadinejad became President in 2005, he appointed Naqdi as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Central Headquarters, a post from which he resigned in June 2007. (COMMENT: United Nations Security Council Resolution 1803 included Naqdi in its travel ban for his efforts to evade earlier Security Council resolutions in his capacity as Deputy Chief of Armed Forces General Staff for Logistics and Industrial Research.  END COMMENT).    6. (C) According to press Naqdi's predecessor Hojjatoleslam Hossein Ta'eb, rumored to have been considered for MOIS chief at the start of Ahmadinejad's second term, will be be appointed a position in IRGC Intelligence.  Ta'eb has repeatedly accused the United States of plotting to overthrow the IRIG; in late September he alleged the USG was hiring "agents and mercenaries"  DUBAI 00000411  002.2 OF 002   for that purpose. (COMMENT: Ta'eb's mindset appears to dovetail with that of IRGC Commander Jaafari, who has re-oriented the IRGC to focus on the threat of a 'velvet revolution.' END COMMENT.)    BASIJ SUBSUMED INTO IRGC GROUND FORCES    7. (C) Along with these personnel changes is the reported imminent merging of the Basij into the IRGC Ground Forces, a long rumored development reportedly intended to improve coordination.  Since the early days of the Revolution the Basij had maintained its relative independence from the IRGC despite technically falling under its authority.  However, in October 2007 as part of his broader changes to the IRGC to focus on internal threats, Jaafari placed the Basij under the authority of the IRGC's Joint Chief of Staff.  At the time, he promised that the Basij would maintain its independence and not become a part of the IRGC ground forces.  The Supreme Leader's representative to the IRGC made similar assurances in mid-2008. If these reports are accurate, Jaafari has rolled back such promises in what Iranian media construes as the "second stage" of his plan to re-orient that IRGC, the first stage being the establishment of provincial IRGC Command Centers in each of Iran's provinces.    8. (C) COMMENT: According an IRPO analytical contact with extensive IRGC expertise, the Basij has long sought to resist IRGC efforts to incorporate it into its ground forces. But Basij integration within the IRGC Ground Forces would continue the process of its organizational assimilation into the IRGC. It is yet unclear how exactly these just-announced personnel changes are connected to any impending bureaucratic re-arrangement; similarly, it is unclear whether Ta'eb's potential transfer to IRGC Intelligence represents a promotion or a demotion.  What is clear is that IRGC Commander Jaafari, with the blessing of Supreme Leader Khamenei, is continuing his re-organization of the IRGC in line with his theories on the primacy of countering the "soft threats" now facing the regime. END COMMENT. EYRE
