C o n f i d e n t i a l section 01 of 04 ankara 000348SipdisE.o. 12958: decl: 01/07/2014 Tags: prel, pgov, pins, tu Subject: turkish p.m. Erdogan goes to washington: how strong a leader in the face of strong challenges?(U) Classified by Ambassador Eric Edelman; reasons: 1.5 (b,d).1. (C) Summary: P.M. Erdogan expects Washington to focus on Cyprus, economic reform, and anti-terrorism cooperation among other issues. In turn he will press for (1) concrete U.S. actions to block what Turks believe is the formation by accretion of a de facto Kurdish state in n. Iraq; (2) concrete U.S. actions against the PKK in Iraq; and (3) clear USG support for his government. While the Turkish side sees the visit as mainly about developing our broad common strategy, Erdogan is also looking for a public outcome he can characterize as concrete results. At the same time, although Erdogan is currently unchallenged as the paramount political figure in Turkey, he and his party face deep challenges which, if he cannot rise to them, will affect his longevity in government, Turkey's democratic development, and U.S.-Turkish cooperation. End summary.2. (C) P.M. Erdogan appears to be riding a political high and uncommon luck as he prepares for his Jan. 28-29 visit to Washington, where he hopes to demonstrate the Administration recognizes him as an equal partner.3. (C) Erdogan has been primed to hear plainspoken expressions of U.S. interest in Turkish action (1) to reach a Cyprus settlement by May 1; (2) to hew to credible economic reform and macro policies; (3) to cooperate unreservedly against terrorist groups of all stripes, including Islamist ones (he rejects the term Islamic terrorism); (4) to cooperate on Iraq; (5) to open the border with Armenia; and (6) to reopen the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Halki seminary in a way acceptable to the Patriarchate.4. (C) In turn Erdogan will argue that raising U.S.-Turkish relations to a higher level depends directly on (1) clear USG political and diplomatic actions to dispel the conviction and consequent resentment among Turks of all political stripes that the U.S. is tolerating step-by-step formation of a de facto independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq; (2) concrete USG actions to remove the PKK threat from Iraq; (3) high-level, sustained USG support for the GOT's new Cyprus initiative; and (4) the clearest possible signal that the U.S. stands behind the democratically-elected government.Who are we dealing with?5. (C) Charismatic, and possessing a common touch and phenomenal memory for faces and functions of thousands of party members across the country, Erdogan has a strong pragmatic core. His pragmatism has led him away from the radical Islamist milieu of his past, a point noted to us unhappily by his (radical) former spiritual leader Kemal Hoca. His pragmatism has also led him to avoid precipitously pushing Islamic agenda items such as the wearing of Islamist headscarves while using his outstanding preacher skills and persona as someone persecuted by the secularist Establishment to maintain his hold on the hearts of his more religious supporters.6. (C) In short, a natural politician, Erdogan has a common touch and an ability to communicate his empathy for the plight and aspirations of the common citizen. He projects the image of the Tribune of Anatolia, ready to take on corruption and privilege and to defend conservative traditions. As a result his AK Party won a two-thirds parliamentary majority in Nov. 2002 national elections. Owing to AK's image as the party of change at the national level, good record in providing services at the municipal level, and lack of viable political alternatives, AK could gain around 50% of the vote in March 28 nationwide local elections. Party insiders project that such a result would give AK control of 65% or more of the 3,200 municipalities in Turkey, including probably Istanbul and Ankara and perhaps even Izmir, where AK has not done well to date, plus most of the other large cities. Every step by the Turkish Establishment to try to diminish him  whether by blocking legislation or attacking his motives  cements his popularity in Turkey's urban sprawls and across the Anatolian heartland. While opposition to him remains bitter in various loci of the State apparatus, Erdogan currently faces no credible political opponent or party.7. (C) Moreover, Erdogan knows his government has gained credit well beyond AK supporters, as well as in the EU, for political reforms which, if fully implemented, will substantially strengthen democracy in Turkey. His government's inability to pass legislation or regulations favored by AK supporters  land registry reform, Supreme Education Board (YOK) reform, Koran course reform  has not eroded support. Indeed, even right-of-center Turks who remain wary of AK readily tell us the Establishment's opposition to such reforms is counterproductive. Even if one can attribute Turkey's lowest inflation and interest rates in 30 years to luck, Central Bank skill, and global emerging market trends rather than to the AK government's actions, Erdogan has reaped the political benefit.8. (C) Taking a high-profile approach in pursuing Turkey's EU candidacy through direct campaigning in EU capitals, Erdogan has relished being feted by EU leaders for the past year. He will have had positive visits by EU Commission President Prodi and German FonMin Fischer before his Washington trip and looks forward to the February visit by German Chancellor Schroeder. He sees himself at this point as one of (if not the) most important leaders of the Muslim world. Erdogan's view of relations with the u.s.9. (C) Erdogan recognizes that U.S. support can be important for Turkey's economy and EU aspirations. He sees his task as managing Turks's ambivalence toward us; at the same time he wants to avoid being labeled pro-American. From the low point in bilateral relations in March 2003 he has taken several supportive steps, while being careful not to be too closely associated with us since opening Turkish airspace for the Iraq war. Erdogan agreed to a ground line of communication for Coalition forces in Iraq. He pushed through authorization for a Turkish deployment in support of the Coalition. He agreed to U.S. troop rotation through Incirlik airbase. In line with long-standing U.S. desires, he took a bold step in Nov. 2002 to try to move Turkey away from its no-solution stance on Cyprus and may be prepared now to do more. He seems to be more open than any previous Prime Minister to a re-opening of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Halki seminary.10. (C) On the other hand he has made public his discomfort with what most fellow Turks also see as American complicity in creation of a de facto independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq and lack of concrete U.S. action against the PKK/KADEK/KHK. He has not controlled anti-American suspicions among the AK parliamentary group or within the Cabinet (DefMin Gonul told us recently on the margins of a symposium in Istanbul that in closed meetings FonMin Gul continues to praise the Parliament's March 1, 2003 turndown of U.S. deployment and to advocate a more Arab/Islamic foreign policy orientation as a counter to relations with the U.S.). Nevertheless, Erdogan and Ministers like Gonul and Justice Minister Cicek see U.S. support for his government as essential to his survival, and he wants a successful visit.The deeper challenges for erdogan11. (C) Erdogan, AK, and his government face half a dozen serious domestic challenges which, if he does not manage them well, will begin to put a severe strain on his ability to govern by late 2004 and on his and our ability to maintain dynamic, deep U.S.-Turkish cooperation:Erdogan's character: Erdogan has traits which render him seriously vulnerable to miscalculating the political dynamic, especially in foreign affairs, and vulnerable to attacks by those who would disrupt his equilibrium. First, overbearing pride. Second, unbridled ambition stemming from the belief God has anointed him to lead Turkey (Mustafa Bilginer, a close confidant of Erdogan and his wife Emine from 1997-2003, has analyzed this trait in a draft book on Erdogan's character; Erdogan used Koranic allusion in his speech to the AK Congress in Oct. 2003 to make the point about his God-appointed mission). Third, an authoritarian loner streak which prevents growth of a circle of strong and skillful advisors, a broad flow of fresh information to him, or development of effective communications among the party headquarters, government, and parliamentary group. This streak also makes him exceptionally thin-skinned. Fourth, an overweening desire to stay in power which, despite his macho image, renders him fearful and prone to temporizing even at moments which call for swift and resolute decisions. Fifth, a distrust of women which manifests itself not only in occasional harsh public comments but also in his unwillingness to give women any meaningful decision-making authority in AK.Rival centers of power: Cabinet Ministers, Erdogan advisors and a raft of M.P.s constantly tell us of the tensions between Erdogan and Gul, with the latter appearing repeatedly to try to undercut Erdogan. Parliamentary Speaker Bulent Arinc, who has a strong following among more Islamist AK M.P.s, has also caused problems for Erdogan on controversial questions like pushing the right to wear headscarves at State functions. Although Arinc has kept a low profile for the past seven months, he remains a locus of troublemaking, especially on questions involving the U.S. (e.g., troop rotation through Incirlik).Lack of technocratic depth: While some AK appointees appear to be capable of learning on the job, others are incompetent or seem to be pursuing private or lodge (cemaat) interests. AK is far from bringing the bureaucracy under control or making it work efficiently. We hear constant anecdotal evidence, not only from those on the secularist left who have deep prejudices against AK but also from contacts on the right, that AK appointees, at the national and provincial levels, are incompetent or narrow-minded Islamists. AK officials  from Cabinet Ministers to local-level party activists across the country  admit to us that the party's choice of competent and broadly acceptable candidates for the March local elections will be exceptionally difficult and the election of controversial or inept AK candidates would complicate AK's ability to govern both at the local and national level.Weakness of public relations and the image of hidden agendas: Erdogan lacks advisors who are able to pre-empt or handle the news cycle; none of his advisors has good working relations with the Turkish military. His government has failed continually to consult broadly and openly or to prepare public opinion for legislative initiatives, long-overdue reforms, or foreign policy steps (e.g., pre-war U.S. troop deployment or troop rotation). As a result AK creates the impression, exploited by the Establishment, that it harbors an anti-republican, deep Islamist agenda or is selling out the country, leading to Establishment (dis)information campaigns which cause the government to retreat.Corruption: AK rode to power on the common citizen's revulsion against corruption. Charges that Erdogan amassed his fortune through kickbacks as mayor of Istanbul have never been proven but we now hear more and more from insiders that close advisors such as private secretary Hikmet Bulduk, Mucahit Arslan, and Cuneyd Zapsu are engaging in wholesale influence peddling. xxxxx that Erdogan and he benefited directly from the award of the Tupras (state petroleum refinery) privatization to a consortium including a Russian partner. Erdogan's direct acquisition of a significant interest in a food distribution company has become a public controversy.Islamist complexes and prejudices: Some appointments, such as Prime Ministry Undersecretary Dincer (who stands by his 1995 article calling into question the relevance of the Republic), Education Ministry Undersecretary Birinci (who in the past called himself an ummetci, i.e., a follower of a greater Islamic order and an opponent of the Republic), and head of State-run Turkish Radio and Television Demiroz (who once paid homage to Afghan fundamentalist Hekmatyar), have made the core of the State Establishment  Armed Forces, Presidency, and Judiciary  profoundly uneasy. Erdogan's refusal to condemn these positions, the question of the level of influence of Islamic brotherhoods and groups (including the followers of Fethullah Gulen) on the government, and the presence of Turkish Hizbullah supporters in AK Party provincial structures in the Southeast have also raised deep concerns among many long-standing Embassy contacts who themselves are pious. Erdogan himself recognizes the pernicious effect of a closed brotherhood mentality (cemaatcilik) in political affairs, as reflected in his Jan. 10 speech to a symposium in Istanbul, but how well he can control the phenomenon remains a very open question.Comment12. (C) As Erdogan rides the twin desires for reform in Turkey and for wider prosperity, he challenges those who have traditionally reserved power and wealth for themselves at least to yield pride of place to a different elite. While his ultimate direction and success remain to be seen, at this time Erdogan is the only partner capable of advancing toward the U.S. vision of a successful, democratic Turkey integrated into Europe.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 007211  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/2029 TAGS: PREL PGOV PINS ECON TUSUBJECT: ERDOGAN AND AK PARTY AFTER TWO YEARS IN POWER: TRYING TO GET A GRIP ON THEMSELVES, ON TURKEY, ON EUROPE  (U) Classified by Ambassador Eric Edelman; reasons: E.O. 12958 1.4 (a,b,c,d).  1. (C) Summary: PM Erdogan and his ruling AK Party seem to have a firm grip on power -- if for no other reasons that there is currently no viable alternative and inertia weighs heavily in politics.  Nevertheless, Erdogan and his party face enormous challenges if they are successfully to embrace core principles of open society, carry out EU harmonization, and develop and implement foreign policies in harmony with core U.S. interests.  End summary.  2. (C) As PM Erdogan strode through the EU corridors of power Dec. 16-17 with his semi-pro soccer player's swagger and phalanx of sycophantic advisors, he may have seemed a strong candidate for European leader of the year.  A regional leader to be reckoned with for a decade to come.  The man who won Turkey the beginning of accession negotiations with the EU. Who broke loose three decades of frozen Turkish policy on Cyprus.  Who drove major human rights reforms through parliament and through constitutional amendments.  Whose rhetorical skill, while etched with populist victimhood, is redolent with traditional and religious allusions that resonate deeply in the heartland, deeply in the anonymous exurban sprawls.  Who remains the highly popular tribune of the people, without a viable or discernible political rival...outside his own ruling AKP.  3. (C) In short, Erdogan looks unbeatable.  But is he?  And is he willing to give relations with the U.S. the leadership and momentum they need from the Turkish side?  4. (C) Erdogan has a two-thirds majority in parliament.  Main opposition left-of-center CHP amounts to no more than a bunch of elitist ankle-biters.  There is currently no serious, broad-based political alternative, owing to Erdogan's rhetorical dominance and control of the debate on social questions close to the hearts of the center-right majority in Turkey; other party leaders' political bankruptcy; and the stultifying effect of current party and election laws on entry for younger, untainted political aspirants.  AKP argues that the economy, at least from the perspective of macro indicators and continued willingness of emerging-market portfolio investors to buy the expectations and sell the facts, appears to have stabilized.  Moreover, the authority of AKP's nationwide party machine is blurring with the Turkish State's executive power at the provincial and district level and with municipal functions to an extent not seen since the days of the one-party state.  These factors seem set to continue for the foreseeable future.  5. (C) Yet Erdogan and AKP face politically fateful challenges in three areas: foreign policy (EU, Iraq, Cyprus); quality and sustainability of leadership and governance; and resolution of questions fundamental to creation of an open, prosperous society integrated with the broader world (place of religion; identity and history; rule of law).  EU --  6. (U) Erdogan indexed his political survival to getting a negotiation date from the EU.  He achieved that goal.  The Wall Street Journal and other Western and Turkish media have opined that the EU owes Turkey a fair negotiating process leading to accession, with the Journal even putting the onus on the EU by asserting that while Turkey is ready the question is whether Europeans are ready for Turkey.  7. (C) But there's always a Monday morning and the debate on the ground here is not so neat.  With euphoria at getting a date having faded in 48 hours, Erdogan's political survival and the difficulty of the tasks before him have become substantially clearer.  Nationalists on right and left have resumed accusations that Erdogan sold out Turkish national interests (Cyprus) and Turkish traditions.  Core institutions of the Turkish state, which remain at best wary of AKP, have once again begun to probe for weaknesses and to feed insinuations into the press in parallel with the nationalists' assertions.  In the face of this Euro-aversion, neither Erdogan nor his government has taken even minimal steps to prepare the bureaucracy or public opinion to begin tackling the fundamental -- some Turks would say insidious -- legal, social, intellectual and spiritual changes that must occur to turn harmonization on paper into true reform.  The road ahead will surely be hard.  8. (U) High-profile naysayers like main opposition CHP chairman Baykal, former Ambassador Gunduz Aktan, and political scientist Hasan Unal continue to castigate Erdogan.  But theirs is a routine whine.  More significant for us is that many of our contacts cloak their lack of self-confidence at Turkey's ability to join in expressions of skepticism that the EU will let Turkey in.  And there is parallel widespread skepticism that the EU will be around in attractive form in ten years.  9. (C) The mood in AKP is no brighter, with one of FonMin Gul's MFA advisors having described to UK polcounselor how bruised Turkey feels at the EU's inconsistency during the final negotiations leading to Dec. 17 (EU diplomats in Ankara have given us the other side of the story).  Gul was noticeably harder-line than Erdogan in public comments in the lead-up to the Summit, and was harder-line in pre-Summit negotiations in Brussels, according to UK polcounselor. There was noticeable tension between Erdogan and Gul in Brussels according to "Aksam" Ankara bureau chief Nuray Basaran.  She also noted to us that when negotiations seemed to have frozen up on Dec. 17, Erdogan's advisors got phone calls from Putin advisors urging Turkey to walk.  Basaran says that at least some of Erdogan's advisors urged him to do so.  10. (C) AKP's lack of cohesion as a party and lack of openness as a government is reflected in the range of murky, muddled motives for wanting to join the EU we have encountered among those AKPers who say they favor pursuing membership...or at least the process.  Some see the process as the way to marginalize the Turkish military and what remains of the arid "secularism" of Kemalism.  We have also run into the rarely openly-spoken, but widespread belief among adherents of the Turk-Islam synthesis that Turkey's role is to spread Islam in Europe, "to take back Andalusia and avenge the defeat at the siege of Vienna in 1683" as one participant in a recent meeting at AKP's main think tank put it.  This thinking parallels the logic behind the approach of FonMin Gul ally and chief foreign policy advisor in the Prime Ministry Ahmet Davutoglu, whose muddy opinion piece in the Dec. 13 International Herald Tribune is in essence a call for one-way multi-cultural tolerance, i.e., on the part of the EU.  11. (C) Those from the more overtly religious side of AKP whinge that the EU is a Christian club.  While some assert that it is only through Turkish membership and spread of Turkish values that the world can avoid the clash of civilizations they allege the West is fomenting, others express concern that harmonization and membership will water down Islam and associated traditions in Turkey.  Indeed, as AKP whip Sadullah Ergin confided to us recently, "If the EU says yes, everything will look rosy for a short while.  Then the real difficulties will start for AKP.  If the EU says no, it will be initially difficult, but much easier over the long run."  12. (C) AKP also faces the nuts-and-bolts issue of how to prepare for harmonization.  In choosing a chief negotiator Erdogan will need to decide whether the risks that the man he taps will successfully steal his political limelight outweigh the political challenge his choice will face since it will be the Turkish chief negotiator's responsibility to sell the EU position to a recalcitrant Turkish cabinet.  It is because the chief negotiator is likely to be ground down between EU demands and a prickly domestic environment that some observers speculate Erdogan might give the job to his chief internal rival Gul.  13. (C) At the same time the government must reportedly hire a couple thousand people skilled in English or other major EU languages and up to the bureaucratic demands of interfacing with the Eurocrats who descend on ministries as harmonization starts.  If the government continues to hire on the basis of "one of us", i.e., from the Sunni brotherhood and lodge milieu that has been serving as the pool for AKP's civil service hiring, lack of competence will be a problem.  If the government hires on the base of competence, its new hires will be frustrated by the incompetence of AKP's previous hires at all levels.  Questions About AKP Leadership and Governance ---------------------------------------------  14. (C) Several factors will continue to degrade Erdogan's and AKP's ability to effect fair and lasting reforms or to take timely, positive decisions on issues of importance to the U.S.  15. (C) First is Erdogan's character.  16. (C) In our contacts in Anatolia we have not yet detected that Erdogan's hunger for absolute power and for the material benefits of power have begun to erode his grassroots popularity.  Others disagree.  Pollster and political analyst Ismail Yildiz has asserted in three lengthy expositions to us late in Dec. that the erosion has started.  We note that (1) Yildiz expressed frustration to us that the AKP leadership did not respond to his offer to provide political strategy services; (2) he is currently connected to mainstream opposition figures; and (3) he also runs a conspiracy-theory web site.  So we treat his view cautiously.  However, judging by his references and past experience in the Turkish State, he appears to have maintained conncetions with the State apparatus and to have a network of observers and data collectors in all 81 provinces.  17. (C) Inside the party, Erdogan's hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others: as a former spiritual advisor to Erdogan and his wife Emine put it, "Tayyip Bey believes in God...but doesn't trust him."  In surrounding himself with an iron ring of sycophantic (but contemptuous) advisors, Erdogan has isolated himself from a flow of reliable information, which partially explains his failure to understand the context -- or real facts -- of the U.S. operations in Tel Afar, Fallujah, and elsewhere and his susceptibility to Islamist theories.  With regard to Islamist influences on Erdogan, DefMin Gonul, who is a conservative but worldly Muslim, recently described Gul associate Davutoglu to us as "exceptionally dangerous." Erdogan's other foreign policy advisors (Cuneyd Zapsu, Egemen Bagis, Omer Celik, along with Mucahit Arslan and chef de cabinet Hikmet Bulduk) are despised as inadequate, out of touch and corrupt by all our AKP contacts from ministers to MPs and party intellectuals.  18. (C) Erdogan's pragmatism serves him well but he lacks vision.  He and his principal AKP advisors, as well as FonMin Gul and other ranking AKP officials, also lack analytic depth.  He relies on poor-quality intel and on media disinformation.  With the narrow world-view and wariness that lingers from his Sunni brotherhood and lodge background, he ducks his public relations responsibilities.  He (and those around him, including FonMin Gul) indulge in pronounced pro-Sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent, practical domestic or foreign policies.  19. (C) Erdogan has compounded his isolation by constantly traveling abroad -- reportedly 75 foreign trips in the past two years -- with a new series of trips planned for 2005 to Russia, "Eurasia", the Middle East and Africa.  Indeed, his staff says 2005 is the "year of Africa", but they provide no coherent reason why.  This grueling cycle of travel has exhausted him and his staff and disrupted his ability to keep his hand on the tiller of party, parliamentary group, and government.  He has alienated many in the AKP parliamentary group by his habit of harshly chewing out MPs.  Moreover, we understand that MUSIAD, an Anatolia-wide group of businessmen influential in Islamist circles who gave Erdogan key financial support as AKP campaigned prior to the 2002 elections, is disaffected by Erdogan's unapproachability. Judging by comments to us of insiders in the influential Islamist lodge of Fethullah Gulen such as publicist Abdurrahman Celik, the lodge, which has made some inroads into AKP (Minister of Justice Cicek, Minister of Culture and Tourism Mumcu; perhaps 60-80 of 368 MPs; some appointments to the bureaucracy), has resumed the ambivalent attitude it initially had toward Erdogan and AKP.  20. (C) Second is the coalition nature of AKP, the limited number of ministers whom Erdogan trusts, and the efforts of some -- principally FonMin Gul but from time to time Cicek -- to undermine Erdogan.  No one else in AKP comes close to Erdogan in grassroots popularity.  However, Gul's readiness to deprecate Erdogan within AKP and even to foreign visitors (e.g., Israeli deputy PM Olmert) and his efforts to reduce Erdogan's maneuvering room with hard-line criticisms of U.S. policy in Iraq or EU policy on Cyprus have forced Erdogan constantly to look over his shoulder and in turn to prove his credentials by making statements inimical to good U.S.-Turkish relations.  We expect Erdogan to carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle early in 2005, but he will be unable to remove the influence of Gul.  21. (S) Third is corruption.  AKP swept to power by promising to root out corruption.  However, in increasing numbers AKPers from ministers on down, and people close to the party, are telling us of conflicts of interest or serious corruption in the party at the national, provincial and local level and among close family members of ministers.  We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a Turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four Erdogan children in the U.S. purely altruistically are lame.  22. (S) Among the many figures mentioned to us as prominently involved in corruption are Minister of Interior Aksu, Minister of Foreign Trade Tuzmen, and AKP Istanbul provincial chairman Muezzinoglu.  As we understand it from a contact in the intel directorate of Turkish National Police, a continuing investigation into Muezzinoglu's extortion racket and other activities has already produced evidence incriminating Erdogan.  In our contacts across Anatolia we have detected no willingness yet at the grassroots level to look closely at Erdogan or the party in this regard, but the trend is a time bomb.  23. (S) Fourth is the poor quality of Erdogan's and AKP's appointments to the Turkish bureaucracy, at party headquarters, and as party mayoral candidates.  A broad range of senior career civil servants, including DefMin Gonul, former Undersecretary of Customs Nevzat Saygilioglu, former Forestry DirGen Abdurrahman Sagkaya, and many others, has expressed shock and dismay to us at the incompetence, prejudices and ignorance of appointees such as Omer Dincer, an Islamist academic whom Erdogan appointed Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry, THE key position in the government/state bureaucracy.  Dincer is despised by the TGS.  Many interlocutors also point to the weakness of Erdogan's deputy party chairmen.  The result is that, unlike former leaders such as Turgut Ozal or Suleyman Demirel, both of whom appointed skilled figures who could speak authoritatively for their bosses as their party general secretary and as Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry, Erdogan has left himself without people who can relieve him of the burden of day-to-day management or who can ensure effective, productive channels to the heart of the party and the heart of the Turkish state.  Two Big Questions -----------------  24. (C) Turkey's EU bid has brought forth reams of pronouncements and articles -- Mustafa Akyol's Gulenist-tinged "Thanksgiving for Turkey" in Dec. 27 Weekly Standard is one of the latest -- attempting to portray Islam in Turkey as distinctively moderate and tolerant with a strong mystical (Sufi) underpinning.  Certainly, one can see in Turkey's theology faculties some attempts to wrestle with the problems of critical thinking, free will, and precedent (ictihad), attempts which, compared to what goes on in theology faculties in the Arab world, may appear relatively progressive.  25. (C) However, the broad, rubber-meets-the-road reality is that Islam in Turkey is caught in a vise of (1) 100 years of "secular" pressure to hide itself from public view, (2) pressure and competition from brotherhoods and lodges to follow their narrow, occult "true way", and (3) the faction- and positivism-ridden aridity of the Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet).  As a result, Islam as it is lived in Turkey is stultified, riddled with hypocrisy, ignorant and intolerant of other religions' presence in Turkey, and unable to eject those who would politicize it in a radical, anti-Western way.  Imams are for the most part poorly educated and all too ready to insinuate anti-Western, anti-Christian or anti-Jewish sentiments into their sermons. Exceptionally few Muslims in Turkey have the courage to challenge conventional Sunni thinking about jihad or, e.g., verses in the Repentance shura of the Koran which have for so long been used to justify violence against "infidels".  26. (C) The problem is compounded by the willingness of politicians such as Gul to play elusively with politicized Islam.  Until Turkey ensures that the humanist strain in Islam prevails here, Islam in Turkey will remain a troubled, defensive force, hypocritical to an extreme degree and unwilling to adapt to the challenges of open society.  27. (C) A second question is the relation of Turkey and its citizens to history -- the history of this land and citizens' individual history.  Subject to rigid taboos, denial, fears, and mandatory gross distortions, the study of history and practice of historiography in the Republic of Turkey remind one of an old Soviet academic joke: the faculty party chief assembles his party cadres and, warning against various ideological threats, proclaims, "The future is certain.  It's only that damned past that keeps changing."  28. (C) Until Turkey can reconcile itself to its past, including the troubling aspects of its Ottoman past, in free and open debate, how will Turkey reconcile itself to the concept and practice of reconciliation in the EU?  How will it have the self confidence to take decisions and formulate policies responsive to U.S. interests?  Some in AKP are joining what is still only a handful of others to take tentative, but nonetheless inspiring, steps in this regard. However, the road ahead will require a massive overhaul of education, the introduction and acceptance of rule of law, and a fundamental redefinition of the relation between citizen and state.  In the words of the great (Alevi) Anatolian bard Asik Veysel, this is a "long and delicate road."  29. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. EDELMAN

Sison. For reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d).  1.  (U) Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed,s weekly Sunday "VIP Majlis" provided an excellent opportunity for a visiting National Defense University delegation to observe first-hand the UAEG,s informal consultative process.  MbZ, brothers MinState Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan and Interior Minister Sheikh Saif, and Labor Minister al Ka'abi were joined by several dozen prominent Abu Dhabi officials and businessmen for the weekly gathering at Bateen Palace.  NDU ---  2.  (U) NDU President Lt. Gen. Dunn and National War College Deputy Commandant Ambassador Wahba briefed MbZ on several new NDU initiatives, including opportunities for UAE students in the Information Resources Management College program, which emphasizes threats, vulnerabilities, and risks in a net-centric environment.  Ambassador Sison praised the UAE's selection of NDU candidates, noting that several were serving in key positions today:  GHQ Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff MG Mohammed Hilal al-Kaabi, GHQ Director of General Procurement Obaid Al Ketbi, Deputy Commander UAE Air Force Brigadier Ali, and MbZ's aide Yousef al Otaiba had all benefited from NDU programs.  Iraq ------  3.  (C) Ambassador Sison noted that day's visit to Iraq by Secretary Rice, highlighting the Secretary's encouragement  SIPDIS for continued momentum in the political process and her meetings with PM al-Jaafari and KDP leader Barzani.  MbZ voiced disdain for al-Jaafari, citing (again) his concerns over the Prime Minister's ties to Iran.  These concerns were aimed at Jaafari's Dawaa Party colleagues, as well.  While agreeing that it was important for Iraq's Sunni Arabs to be more involved in the political process and in drafting the constitution, MbZ complained that "there wasn't one worthwhile Sunni" on the scene.  He criticized new Sunni Defense Minister Dulaimi as being "in it for himself."  Nor did MbZ have anything good to say about former Iraqi Finance Minister Mahdi's nomination as one of two Vice Presidents, complaining that Mahdi "did not work for the people of Iraq."  Nonetheless, MbZ said he agreed with the USG's efforts to encourage the various Iraqi factions to work together.  The UAE would continue to help train Iraqi police forces at the UAE's police academy in Al Ain and provide reconstruction assistance.  It was important for the region as a whole that the U.S. and its allies "got it right" in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, he underscored.  (Note:  MbZ aide Yousef al Otaiba had a few days earlier shared with Ambassador concerns passed by former PM Allawi that Dulaimi was "devious," "bad news," "very close" to Iranian intelligence, and had been introduced to the Iranians by Chalabi.   Yousef had also noted the UAEG,s impression Mahdi had not always been a "team player" in the government of former PM Allawi.  End note.)  Iran ----  4.  (S) Turning to Iran, MbZ voiced certainty that the EU-3 efforts with Iran would break down and that Iran would resume its nuclear activities ) if it had not already done so. Repeating concerns first voiced to us in February (reftel), MbZ appeared convinced that it was only a matter of time before Israel or the U.S. would strike Iranian nuclear facility targets.  U.S. installations in the Gulf could be targeted by Iran in the aftermath of such an action, he warned.  MbZ agreed with the USG,s tough line with Tehran and the Europeans.  A nuclear-armed Iran would destabilize the Gulf region and possibly allow terrorist access to WMD. MbZ asked Lt. Gen. Dunn whether it would be possible for  to "take out" all locations of concern in Iran via air power; Lt. Gen. Dunn voiced doubt that this would be possible given the dispersed locations.  "Then it will take ground forces!" MbZ exclaimed.  Ambassador noted that the UAE's Director of Military Intelligence, BG Essa al Mazrouei, would pay counterpart visits this week to CENTCOM, J-2, DIA, and CIA for discussions on Iran and Iraq-related matters. MbZ said he looked forward to sharing "contingency planning" scenarios in future conversations.  Pakistan --------  5.  (C) Ambassador asked about MbZ's visit the week before to Lahore to meet with Pakistani President Musharraf.  MbZ chuckled and asked why the USG "always" convinced the Pakistanis to delay news of the capture of senior Al Qaeda operatives such as Abu Faraj al Libbi.  MbZ went on to congratulate Washington for its decision to allow U.S. firms to bid for contracts to provide F-16s and other defense technology to Pakistan.  It was important to support Musharraf as he battled the terrorists, he emphasized.  While the Indians had and would continue to balk at the decision, the region needed Musharraf to stay strong.  There was no alternative leader in sight, MbZ opined.  Besides, he continued, the F-16 decision would not tip the military balance between India and Pakistan.  Even if it had, India's strength as a stable democracy would ensure that it would not ever be in as "risky" a situation as its neighbor.  MbZ then slapped his knee and said "you,ll never guess what Musharraf asked me...he asked me whether the UAE had received approval for the Predator!"  (Note:  the USG's inability to meet the UAE's request for an armed Predator remains a sore point for MbZ, although he has not directly raised the issue with us for some time.)  Gyrocopter, GAWC ----------------  6.  (SBU) MbZ also referred to his interest in exploring selling the UAE's "gyrocopter" (a helicopter-supported UAV co-developed with Austrian company Schiebel) to the U.S. Air Force, an idea he first floated during Gen. Moseley,s visit for the May 3 F-16 ceremony.  MbZ noted that his aide would pass detailed gyrocopter specifications to the Embassy this week.  (Note: We will be exploring this initiative with CENTAF and CENTCOM in relation to force protection aerial surveillance system needs at Al Dhafra airbase for the 380 th Air Expeditionary Wing.  End note.)  7.  (C) Lt. Gen. Dunn complimented MbZ on the Gulf Air Warfare Center (GAWC), which he and the NDU group had toured that morning.  MbZ expressed satisfaction over the relationship between the UAE and U.S. Air Forces, but expressed disappointment that more GCC countries had not joined recent GAWC classes.  Ambassador noted the recent robust participation by Saudi Arabia in the GAWC's fourth class, which had included six Saudi F-15s and two young pilots who were also members of the Saudi royal family.  MbZ asked whether the two high-ranking Saudis had actually completed all requirements for graduation or had been "passed through."  Ambassador confirmed that they had completed all course requirements.   MbZ commented that "the real reason" the Saudis had turned out for the GAWC class had been "to see what the UAE was up to" with the F-16 Block 60 and other procurement successes.  Although Egypt and Jordan wished to join in the next GAWC class, MbZ added, they also wanted the UAE Air Force to pay fuel costs.  MbZ said he had asked both countries "to go talk to ADNOC," the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.  France ------  8.  (U) MbZ noted that he would travel to Paris June 18-20 to meet with President Chirac, recalling that he had canceled his trip to France at the last minute in mid-January.  Camel Jockeys -------------  9.  (SBU) On the margins of the MbZ conversation, Ambassador thanked Interior Minister Sheikh Saif for his assistance the week before in allowing G/TIP visitor Feleke Assefa access to camel jockey rehabilitation and social support centers. Ambassador noted that a Tier 3 ranking remained a possibility despite the UAEG,s vigorous efforts since mid-March with UNICEF, IOM, and others.  A trafficking in persons reassessment would take place in August, she noted, and it was important for the UAE to continue the good work it was doing in solving the problem.  MbZ aide Yousef al Otaiba promised to forward a copy of the UAE-UNICEF TIP implementing agreement and budget. (Note: he has done so; we have forwarded the document electronically to G/TIP and NEA/ARPI. End note.)  Labor and the FTA -----------------  10.  (SBU) Labor Minister al Ka'abi noted he had received reports that the U.S. and UAE sides had moved closer on the text of the labor chapter of the FTA during the last day of negotiations.  He reiterated the UAEG,s concern that it receive some recognition of its unique demographic situation, as only 15 percent of the population held Emirati citizenship. SISON

ANKARA 1511E. ANKARA 1342F. ANKARA 944G. ANKARA 1102 (U) Classified by CDA Robert Deutsch; E.O. 12958, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1. (C) Summary: Turkey is stuck in a domestic and foreign policy drift stemming from leadership and structural problems in ruling AKP. A long-overdue healthy debate over Turkey's identity and AKP, including its handling of relations with the U.S., has started. But AKP's policy muddle is leaving a vacuum that resurgent nationalism is seeking to fill. This period of drift could be extended, making EU reforms and bilateral cooperation more difficult. The drift may well continue until the next crisis creates new political alternatives in a day of reckoning. End Summary.AKP Government Adrift-----------------------2. (C) As the AKP government confronts the arduous task of EU harmonization, it is manifestly adrift on domestic political and economic reform. Implementation of reform legislation passed in 2003-2004 is seriously deficient (refs A and B). The AKP government has a poor working relationship with the military, the Presidency and the largely-secular state bureaucracy. It is failing to control corruption in the AK party. It has been slow to introduce the banking, tax administration and social security legislation required by the IMF as a pre-condition for a new stand-by program. It is neglecting relations with the EU. Erdogan has delayed appointing a chief negotiator for EU accession negotiations; both Erdogan and FM Gul have made statements which have disturbed EU officials and politicians. Erdogan has still not decided on a much-anticipated cabinet reshuffle.3. (C) AK party officials publicly deny the government's obvious drift and we see no sign it has yet begun to undermine Erdogan's voter base. AKP's ability to get back on track is compromised by its Islamist/neo-Ottoman reflexes and single-party-state spoils system. We doubt this government will be able to refocus or move our bilateral relationship  which remains strong in some areas  back to a more strategic level.4. (C) PM Erdogan is isolated. He has lost touch with his Cabinet and parliamentary group. We hear MPs and Ministers alike, xxxxx who is close to Erdogan, complain they no longer have comfortable access, or feel obliged to kowtow for fear of incurring Erdogan's wrath. Business associations, strong advocates of AKP economic policies, tell us they feel they have lost the PM's ear. Erdogan has cut himself off from his closest spiritual advisors in the Iskender Pasa Naksibendi brotherhood in which he grew up, as we have heard directly from xxxxx.5. (C) According to a broad range of our contacts, Erdogan reads minimally, mainly the Islamist-leaning press. According to others with broad and deep contacts throughout the establishment, Erdogan refuses to draw on the analyses of the MFA, and the military and National Intelligence Organization have cut him off from their reports. He never had a realistic world view, but one key touchstone is a fear of being outmaneuvered on the Islamist side by Hoca Erbakan's Saadet Party. Instead, he relies on his charisma, instincts, and the filterings of advisors who pull conspiracy theories off the Web or are lost in neo-Ottoman Islamist fantasies, e.g., Islamist foreign policy advisor and Gul ally Ahmet Davutoglu.6. (C) Inside the AKP, the more ideological Deputy PM/FonMin Gul continues behind-the-scenes machinations, especially during Erdogan's foreign junkets. Gul seems to be trying to undermine Erdogan and take on more party control. He may hope to reclaim the Prime Ministership, which he was forced to cede to Erdogan four months after AKP acceded to power. With his relatively good English, Gul works to project an image of being moderate, or modern. In fact, Gul's peers say he has a far more ideologized anti-Western worldview than Erdogan. Gul, reflecting his pragmatic streak, has made some constructive statements on bilateral relations and on Turkey's Iraq policy since the Iraqi elections. However, we understand that Gul and a group of like-minded MPs and journalists continue to see fomenting anti-American attitudes as one way to get at Erdogan while also being moved by emotions of Islamic/Sunni solidarity.7. (C) AKP's disarray has generated significant internal unease from those who support Erdogan, but also from some of the other tendencies forming AK. xxxxx that Erdogan does not know how to proceed, either on domestic policy or on rebuilding relations with the U.S. xxxxx, a bellwether of Islamist sentiment, has told two of our insider contacts that he is about to resign in disgust at the party's rampant corruption. xxxxx one of Erdogan's closest business and brotherhood friends and advisors from Istanbul, says he sees no future for this government and thinks it is time for a more flexible and open leader. Leading member xxxxx has expressed to us the Gulenists' sense that Erdogan cannot hack it. Long Overdue Healthy Debate-----------------------------8. (C) The ferment is not all bad. It is beginning to force some to question the real roots of inertia and stasis in a Turkey that needs to accelerate its transition. We are encouraged by the determination of some to open a long-overdue, healthy debate on AKP and its handling of Turkey's relations with the U.S. Secretary Rice's February 6 visit and subsequent U.S. media coverage helped ignite the debate. Another catalyst was Deputy CHOD Basbug's January 26 press briefing, in which he coolly analyzed Turkish concerns about Iraq and repeatedly emphasized that one cannot reduce broad and comprehensive U.S.-Turkish relations to a single issue. It was not until late February, that Erdogan  albeit without conviction in his voice  expressed anything similar to Basbug's assessment of the importance of bilateral relations.9. (C) The debate has now produced some sustained trenchant criticism of AKP's domestic and foreign policies from several insightful mainstream commentators. However, mainstream commentators are seen as too pro-American to be persuasive among AKP or its supporters. Perhaps more important have been the decisions of some pro-AKP Islamist columnists to write unusually blunt warnings that the AKP government must pull itself together or risk a fall. The Parliamentary opposition has continued its anti-American 60's leftist rhetoric as it winds its merry way to irrelevance.Resurgent Nationalism----------------------10. (C) There is a more disturbing consequence of AKP's weakness: resurgent nationalism. Two of the hottest selling books in Turkey are Metal Storm, a conspiracy novel that feeds the worst instincts of Turks with its tale of a U.S. invasion of Turkey followed by Turkish nuclear counter-strike with the help of the Russians; and Mein Kampf (ref C). Under instructions from the Directorate of Religious Affairs, imams across Turkey delivered a March 11 sermon against Christian missionaries (ref D), claiming they aim to steal the beliefs of our young people and children. We are receiving increased reports of anti-Christian activity in different regions of Turkey (e.g., ref E). The Central Bank Governor told us that nationalist/isolationist forces are behind the problems with the IMF (ref F). An attempt to burn the Turkish flag during a Newroz celebration in Mersin has drawn strong nationalistic statements from across the spectrum, including a statement from the General Staff that the Turkish nation and the Turkish armed forces are ready to sacrifice their blood to protect their country and their flag. The decision to memorialize, after a 47-year hiatus, the killing by British forces of several Ottoman soldiers during the Allies' W.W.I occupation of Istanbul also bespeaks the national mood.11. (U) The Turkish media have given prominent coverage to what appears to be a growth in street crime and to a parallel refusal of the police, angry at limitations on their operational abilities under the new EU-inspired criminal code, to patrol aggressively. In a March 18 column, Ertugrul Ozkok, managing editor of Turkey's leading newspaper Hurriyet and one of the most authoritative press voices of the Establishment, noted that the Turkish public is deeply disturbed by what it perceives as a breakdown of law and order. Ozkok, in what would appear to be an overstatement, closed with a warning to Erdogan that, when democratic forces cannot ensure safety in the streets (sic), then the public and political space is left to other forces. In a March 4 column, Umit Ozdag, now in the running for chairmanship of the right-wing nationalist MHP, cited increased crime as one reason for the current popularity of Mein Kampf.12. (C) Resurgent nationalist feelings probably also played a role in the press and government reactions to comments from EU Ambassador Kretschmer about the government's loss of momentum and EU accession, to the EU Troika's worry about the police violence against a March 6 Istanbul demonstration, and the press feeding frenzy over Ambassador Edelman's innocent remarks on Syria.Comment------13. (C) Having reached one of its primary goals  a date to begin EU accession negotiations  Erdogan's AKP government is out of ideas and energy. For now, EU- and IMF-required reforms will face tougher opposition from re-energized nationalists, the government will be tempted to delay difficult decisions in any realm, and resistance to change will be the default mode. Bilateral cooperation will be more difficult, more vulnerable to characterization as unreasonable U.S. demands that infringe upon Turkish sovereignty.14. (C) This period of drift could last a long time. AKP's Parliamentary majority is eroding, but only slowly (ref G). Despite the unhappiness inside AKP, there is currently no political alternative and there are risks to anyone who actually forces a split. Erdogan still has a nuclear option in hand  early elections. The danger is that tough decisions and the settling out of the political system will be put off until a real new crisis emerges which will either energize the AKP or bring new political alternatives. Waiting bears a real cost, since Turkey needs to be more nimble in pursuing the political, economic, social and foreign policy agendas many Turks, the EU and the U.S., have been supporting, than this type of static drift will permit.

(C) Summary: Long rumored to be considering a cabinet re-shuffle, PM Erdogan has made his first move suddenly and in limited fashion. However, more ministers in a cabinet which is still dominated by people loyal to Erdogan's chief internal rival FonMin Gul may be in Erdogan's sights as he tries slowly but surely to whittle down Gul's influence. End summary.2. (C) In a trademark sudden move, PM Erdogan announced the replacement of three ministers in a mini-Cabinet shuffle June 4. Cabinet changes have been an intense subject of debate and waiting-for-Godot expectation in ruling AKP since Erdogan inherited the Cabinet from his internal arch-rival Abdullah Gul, now FonMin, in March 2003. Yet despite the heavy Gul influence (until this shuffle Erdogan could depend on only four of 22 ministers for internal political support) and despite his overriding popular support, Erdogan long appeared intimidated from making any changes. When Minister of Culture and Tourism Erkan Mumcu resigned in Feb. 2005, Erdogan remained in thrall to Gul for the abortive choice of current State Minister Besir Atalay and eventual choice of Atilla Koc to replace Mumcu.3. (C) Now Erdogan appears to have overcome his indecision, spurred in part by what Minister of Energy Hilmi Guler told a close contact of ours June 6 is Erdogan's realization of how much damage to his policies Gul and his circle are wreaking. Finally dismissed are three prominent incompetents: Minister of Agriculture Sami Guclu, a barrier to progress on issues of concern to the U.S. and a Gul ally; Minister of Public Works Zeki Ergezen, infamous for his scornful remarks about infidels (gavurlar), surrounded by rumors of corruption, unable to finish Erdogan's 15,000 kilometer divided highway project on time, an ally of Minister of the Interior Abdulkadir Aksu, and reportedly close to Gul; and State Minister for Women's Affairs Guldal Aksit, daughter of Galip Demirel, a prominent follower of controversial Islamist sage Fethullah Gulen and a close associate of Aksu.4. (U) Erdogan appointed as Minister of Agriculture Mehmet Mehdi 1), a Diyarbakir MP from a prominent local family with high status in the Naksibendi brotherhood. Born in Bismil (Diyarbakir province) 1956; graduate of Ankara U. veterinary faculty, MA in agricultural economics from Aberdeen U, PhD from Ankara U.'s health sciences institute. Veterinarian. Worked in upper-mid-level positions in the Agriculture Ministry and as director of veterinary affairs in the Greater Istanbul Municipality when Erdogan was mayor. Married, three children. Speaks English, but we haven't yet tested his level.5. (C) An AKP xxxxx and two other long-term Embassy contacts with deep relations in AKP describe Eker as a decent but passive man, close to Erdogan. These contacts and Minister of Energy have described in detail how Eker was deeply involved in a plan to remove former Minister Guclu by concealing from him a Russian government note threatening six months ago to suspend imports of Turkish fruits and vegetables for phytosanitary reasons; the ban recently went into effect with Guclu looking ineffectual and uninformed. Embassy Ag Counselor's contacts note that Eker is unlikely to be able to override the Ministry's entrenched, protectionist bureaucracy.6. (U) The new Minister of Public Works is Trabzon MP Faruk Nafiz 2) (umlaut over the O). Born Trabzon 1946. Civil engineering degree from Karadeniz technical University in Trabzon. Senior civil engineer. Former captain of premier league Trabzonspor football team. Chairman of the board of YAPISUN construction company. Chairman of the board of Trabzonspor. A founder of the Trabzon development Foundation. Married, two children. Reportedly speaks English.7. (C) A fellow Trabzon contractor and Trabzonspor board member describes Ozak as coming from the Sufi (mystical) line of the Milli Gorus Islamist movement; he is a quiet, reserved, obedient Erdogan man. As part of Erdogan's strategy to use sports to maintain AKP's grassroots support, and in the wake of AKP's defeat in the Trabzon mayoral race in March 2004, the Istanbul-Black Sea axis which forms Erdogan's Istanbul power base reportedly subsequently succeeded in having Ozak appointed Trabzonspor chairman of the board. At the same time Erdogan reportedly agreed to transfer several million dollars from one of the Prime Ministry's hidden reserves to permit Trabzonspor under Ozak to purchase better players. Our contacts expect Ozak to be relatively more upright than Ergezen was (not a high bar).8. (U) Istanbul Second District MP Nimet 3) is the new State Minister for Women's Affairs. Born Ayranci (Ankara) 1965. Grew up in relatively well-to-do circumstances with a family summer home on Heybeliada, one of the Princes' Islands off Istanbul. Law degree from Istanbul U. law faculty. Worked as an independent attorney, most recently representing the Islamist businessmen's association MUSIAD. A founding member of AKP. Married, one child.9. (C) Cubukcu is focused, highly ambitious, and months ago made clear to us she sought the state minister position. She has ensured that she stays close to Erdogan's wife Emine, which appears to have been a major factor in her selection, according to what party deputy chairman Saban Disli told us June 7. Her businesslike approach and relative openness in private about problems in AKP brought her to our attention early in AKP's tenure; she participated in Embassy's NATO tour for MPs in Feb. 2004 and in the NDI-sponsored democracy commission trip to Washington in Spring 2005. Responding to the bitter complaints of many women from AKP's grassroots in the northeast Black Sea region who have seen their husbands take Russian and other Black Sea-littoral women as second wives, Cubukcu vigorously argued for criminalization of adultery during a controversy over adultery in autumn 2004. On the other hand, although she talks about her son, she rarely mentions her husband and there are persistent questions among some observers of AKP about her attitude toward her own marriage.10. (C) With the dismissal of Guclu and these appointments Erdogan has shown more clearly that he intends to whittle down Gul's influence. By dismissing Aksit and Ergezen and appointing Eker, whose family status in Diyarbakir makes him a powerful rival to Interior Minister Aksu, Erdogan has also drawn the noose around Aksu. Aksu has most recently served Erdogan's purposes by dismissing Hanefi Avci, an leading Gulenist who as National Police (TNP) department head for organized crime was starting to push corruption investigations that were leading to the heart of AKP. However, Erdogan has long been troubled by Aksu, whom he suspects of being ready to bolt from AKP with a number of disgruntled MPs. Aksu's Kurdish favoritism, reported ties to the heroin trade, well-known predilection for teenage girls, and his son's open Mafia links make him a weak link in the Cabinet, one Erdogan knows the core institutions of the Turkish State could exploit at any time.11. (C) Contacts such as Prime Ministry advisor xxxxx who has provided a wealth of accurate insights into AKP, foresee a high possibility that Erdogan will continue to shuffle his cabinet in stages. In addition to Aksu, those who appear to be most in his sights are Minister of Labor Murat Basesgioglu, a former ANAPer who has a poor record of responding to AKP MPs' queries and requests; Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Coskun, who appears to be deeply implicated in a major corruption scandal at the Turkish Standards Institute (TSE)  involving payoffs of $500 million for certifications, according to the TSE director's statement in the June 7 press; and State Minister for Foreign Trade Kursad Tuzmen, a former (ultra-nationalist) MHPer who was implicated in the Iraq oil for food payoffs and is described by multiple contacts as open to every type of kickback.12. (C) Erdogan may also be aiming over time to remove Gul's close associate State Minister Atalay and Minister of Justice and government spokesman Cemil Cicek, who has not bothered to hide his prime ministerial and presidential ambitions and his disrespect for Erdogan.

ANKARA 6543      B. ANKARA 6251      C. ANKARA 6337  Classified By: PolCouns Janice G. Weiner, E.O. 12958, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Summary:  Despite media reports and opposition rumors of splits among PM Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's (AKP) 357 parliamentarians, the group remains intact )- for now.  Among AKP MPs, there are distinctive pious, pragmatic and nationalist currents, with crosscutting personal loyalties.  Recent events in Turkey's heavily-Kurdish southeast have heightened tensions between AKP,s Kurdish-origin MPs and the rest of the parliamentary group. While AKP MPs, numbers may slowly erode over the next year (ref A), a major split is unlikely as long as AKP -- and in particular PM Erdogan -- retain power and popularity.  End Summary.  Despite Wishful Thinking, AKP Not Crumbling Yet --------------------------------------------- --  2.  (C) Over the past year, the Turkish press has repeatedly predicted open splits in the 357-member AKP parliamentary group.  While AKP has ideological and personality-based fault lines, there appears to be little chance of a major split while AKP remains Turkey,s number one party and Erdogan the country,s most popular politician.  Even Ankara AKP MP Ersonmez Yarbay, a maverick frequently openly critical of his own party, downplayed to us the rumors of party splits, saying they have been fueled by the opposition to force early elections.  AKP,s Ideological Currents --------------------------  3.  (C) AKP,s parliamentary group is composed of politicians with widely differing viewpoints.  There are three main ideological currents:  pious, nationalist and pragmatic. Most AKP MPs do not fall neatly into any one category, and personal loyalties crosscut ideology, mostly among pious MPs.  Pious -----  4.  (C) Almost all AKP MPs are religiously observant to some degree; for example, the vast majority fast during Ramadan. However, there is a large and distinctively more pious group of MPs, comprising former members of the banned Islamist Virtue (Fazilet) Party, former members of the National View Islamist youth group, and members of a wide range of (officially banned) Muslim brotherhoods.  Most of AKP,s top leaders fall into this group:  PM Erdogan, DPM/FM Abdullah Gul, parliament Speaker Arinc, Vice Speaker Alptekin (former PM and Islamic Saadet Party head Erbakan's right-hand man) and all five of AKP,s parliamentary whips.  Pious MPs generally represent the central Anatolian heartland, speak no English, and have traveled little.  5. (C) While most Turkish Islamists oppose the EU, AKP,s Islamist MPs toe the AKP line and support it, albeit less enthusiastically since October 3.  Typical of Turkish Islamists, they dislike Turkey,s military and have no ties to it other than their required military service.  Attitudes about the U.S. vary widely, from friendly to suspicious, but most favor better ties with the Muslim world.  Although the GOT, under Erdogan,s leadership, has taken a politically courageous public stand favoring privatization and foreign investment, many pious MPs oppose both.  6.  (C) AKP,s pious MPs are widely rumored to be deeply unhappy about PM Erdogan,s inability to ease restrictions on the wearing of headscarves and on religious schools. However, since AKP came to power in November 2002, no AKP MP has resigned and gone over to the Happiness (Saadet) Party, on AKP's Islamist flank.  Nationalists ------------  7.  (C) It is hard to find a Turk who is not nationalistic. Yet a significant number of AKP MPs (as many as 50, according to one former MP), many of them former members of the ultra-nationalist National Action Party (MHP) or center-right True Path Party (DYP), are strong nationalists, even by Turkish standards.  This group includes Justice Minister and party spokesman Cemil Cicek, Deputy PM Abdullatif Sener, State Minister Kursad Tuzmen, and parliament Vice Speaker Sadik Yakut.  8.  (C) Among AKP MPs, nationalists take the hardest line against  to the EU and on Cyprus.  MFA officials have told us on several occasions that the GOT is delaying bringing the Ankara Agreement extension protocol to parliament for ratification out of concern for the reaction of nationalist AKP MPs (ref B).  Nationalist AKP MPs are deeply suspicious about the motives of Turkey,s ethnic Kurds and were vocal critics of PM Erdogan,s August declaration in Diyarbakir that Turkey has a  problem.8  Like their pious colleagues, nationalists, attitudes about the U.S. vary widely, from friendly to suspicious.  However, even pro-U.S. nationalists become extremely prickly at any perceived U.S. slight to Turkish national honor.  Pragmatists -----------  9.  (C) AKP,s pragmatic MPs generally speak English, are foreign-educated, and tend to be better-traveled than their colleagues.  They often come from large cosmopolitan areas, particularly Ankara or Istanbul; some were previously members of the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP).  Three of AKP,s five vice chairs, who frequently deal with foreigners, are from the pragmatic wing:  Bulent Gedikli, Reha Denemec and Saban Disli.  All are U.S-educated and represent either Istanbul or Ankara.  The same is true for pragmatic Erdogan translator and foreign policy advisor Egemen Bagis, who accompanies the PM on his trips to Europe and the U.S.  10.  (C) Although the pragmatic MPs are often AKP,s most visible face to foreigners, they have less influence inside AKP than their pious and nationalist colleagues.  In early 2005, there were signs of frustration among AKP,s moderates, when a spate of AKP MP resignations went mostly to ANAP. Culture Minister Mumcu, AKP,s highest-profile resignation who went on become ANAP,s Chairman, said publicly he had only felt like a  in AKP (ref C).  11.  (C) Erdogan can ill afford to lose the pragmatists.  In addition to giving AKP a reasonable, big-tent image that plays well in the U.S. and Europe, AKP,s pragmatists are links to Istanbul and Ankara elites.  These MPs are AKP,s friendliest face toward the U.S. (Bagis heads parliament,s Turkey/U.S Friendship Committee), and most receptive to liberal political and open market economic reforms needed for EU accession.  Crosscutting Personal Loyalties -------------------------------  12.  (C) AKP MPS are as divided by personality as by politics, but personality-based fault lines crosscut ideological ones.  PM Erdogan is the glue that holds AKP together; a chunk of AKP MPs were part of Erdogan,s team when he was Istanbul mayor and have followed him onto the national stage.  They include Finance Minister Unakitan, Transportation Minister Yildirim, State Minister Cubukcu, AKP whip Irfan Gunduz, and Erdogan speechwriter Huseyin Besli. All are personally pious or, in Cubukcu,s case, at least have consistently supported positions of the party,s pious wing.  Cubukcu, a female, was one of the few MPs who publicly supported Erdogan,s 2004 proposal to re-criminalize adultery.  13.  (C) Erdogan has consistently protected all three "Istanbul" Ministers despite repeated calls for their resignation.  Many other AKP MPs profess staunch loyalty to  Bey8 and seek to stay close to him.  One contact suggests that Erdogan's strategy is to keep subordinates competing with each other for his attention so they are too busy to be a threat to him.  14.  (C) DPM/FM Gul remains Erdogan,s chief political rival within AKP.  Their differences are not ideological ) Gul and Erdogan are both pious ) but spring from Gul,s ambitions for greater power.  Gul, who represents the parliamentary faction of the banned Virtue Party, has a small, quiet following among AK MPs that includes whip Salih Kapusuz (from Gul,s home town of Kayseri), former AKP public relations vice chair Murat Mercan (sacked for incompetence by Erdogan earlier this year) and Taner Yildiz (also from Kayseri).  15.  (C) Parliament Speaker Arinc is AKP,s third leading personality and potential future rival to Erdogan.  However, Arinc is well behind Gul in influence and, according to our contacts, currently without a significant group of MP loyalists.  AKP's Kurdish MPs -----------------  16.  (C) About 60 AKP MPs, mostly from Turkey,s southeast, are of Kurdish origin; Political and Legal Affairs Vice Chair Dengir Mir Firat is AKP's most visible Kurdish MP.  The Kurds who joined AKP and were elected to parliament tend to be pious, stressing the common bonds among all Muslims over Kurdish nationalism.  (The strongest Kurdish nationalists ran from the pro-Kurdish Democratic People,s Party (DEHAP) in 2002 elections and failed to enter parliament because DEHAP did not cross the ten percent electoral threshold.)  One former Kurdish-origin MP, himself pious, has consistently told us even he considers AKP,s Kurdish MPs extraordinarily passive on Kurdish issues.  17.  (C) Yet recent events in the southeast, including AKP nationalists' reaction against PM Erdogan,s August  problem8 speech in Diyarbakir and alleged Jandarma involvement in a November bombing in the southeastern town of Semdinli, have created tension between AKP,s Kurdish-origin MPs and the rest of the parliamentary group.  An Ankara provincial AKP official told us recently that tension with AKP,s Kurdish-origin MPs has infected AKP's pious wing, weakening it relative to other AKP factions.  18.  (C) Comment:  AKP's parliamentary strength, so far, springs from Erdogan's ability to keep such a diverse group of MPs united, and the lack of any viable opposition.  The question is whether Erdogan can continue to keep the parliamentary group together without turning AKP into an internally-undemocratic, personality-based party in the classic Turkish tradition.  AKP,s opposition will eventually come from inside AKP itself.  However, for now, Erodgan appears well in control and there is no viable political alternative for dissatisfied AKP MPs.  End Comment.

Kurtzer for reasons 1.4(b) an d (d).  1.  (S)  Summary: Mossad Chief Meir Dagan told CODEL Corzine March 13 that Israeli and U.S. thinking on Iran largely tracks, adding that he believes the EU dialogue with Iran will ultimately fail.  Dagan said that Israel has evidence that some foreign fighters have returned home from Iraq, perhaps indicating that the tide may be starting to turn in the U.S. battle against the insurgency there.  He worried however, that these militants' countries of origin -- in particular Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria and Sudan -- are ill-equipped to control the returning jihadis, who might then pose a threat to stability in the region and, ultimately, to Israel.  End Summary.  ---- Iran ----  2.  (C) Senator Jon Corzine, accompanied by Senate staff member Evan Gottesman, the Ambassador, Pol/Res and Poloff (notetaker), met with Mossad Chief Meir Dagan March 13. Acknowledging that there are at times differences in analysis of the facts, Dagan stressed that it is similarities rather than differences that are at the heart of the GOI-U.S. intelligence relationship, particularly on Iran.  The facts themselves are not in dispute, Dagan continued, adding that the U.S. and Israeli assessments of Iran's intentions and plans are largely in accord.  Iran has decided to go nuclear, Dagan said, and nothing will stop it.  Dagan predicted that the EU dialogue with Iran will not succeed and that the issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions would eventually go to the UN Security Council.  ------------------------------------- Iraq - Foreign Fighters Heading Home? -------------------------------------  3.  (S) In response to the Senator's question, Dagan said that the tide may be starting to turn in Iraq with regard to foreign militant activity.  Dagan said Israel has evidence that foreign fighters originating from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Syria and Yemen have arrived back in their home countries, and he assumes that some had returned to Saudi Arabia as well.  Dagan predicted that, as with men who fought in Afghanistan during the 80's and 90's, these returning militants would stay in touch with each other, forming a network based on their common experiences in Iraq.  4.  (S) Stressing that Israel has no assets in Iraq other than a friendly relationship with the Kurds, Dagan said that Israel's interest is more in the impact the jihadis from, for example, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, will have once they return to their countries of origin.  Although he predicts Egypt and Jordan will "do all right," Dagan said he is less confident that governments in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria, and Sudan are sufficiently well-equipped to face down the domestic challenge these returning militants will pose.  The combination of their military training and the absence of strong governments willing and able to confront these men could have a devastating impact on Israel by causing chaos in their home countries, he added.  Dagan predicted that these jihadis will have less of a direct impact on Palestinians, because Palestinians are already well aware of militant views and opinions via Internet chat rooms.  Furthermore, Dagan said he feels that most Palestinians are not searching for "foreign flags," such as al-Qaeda, under which to rally, because those inclined to do so are already being well-mobilized under existing groups in the West Bank and Gaza. ------- Lebanon -------  5.  (C) Dagan opined that Hizballah will never make the transition to a purely political party in Lebanon, since the organization remains very dependent on its jihadi orientation.  Noting that even the recent Hizaballah-sponsored march in Beirut has not deterred the Lebanese from pressing for a full Syrian withdrawal, Dagan advised the U.S. to remain firm in its demand for a complete pullout, and attributed the willingness of the Lebanese people to rise up to U.S. action in Iraq.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- Essential to Use All Assets in the Fight Against Terrorism --------------------------------------------- -------------  6.  (C) Dagan said it is essential to combine all types of intelligence assets, rather than relying exclusively on human intelligence or signal intercepts, to counter terrorist threats.  Terrorist organizations have been seeking to obtain WMD as a matter of course and, unlike countries that wish to acquire these weapons as a deterrent, non-state actors would be more inclined to actually use them, in Dagan's opinion. Asked about the relationship between illicit activities such as narcotic or arms trafficking and terrorism, Dagan confirmed that terrorist organizations try to fund their activities by criminal means, adding that credit card fraud and counterfeiting are also methods favored by these groups. Weapons originating from Yemen and Sudan are smuggled into the territories through Egypt for sale, as well as for use by militants, Dagan said.  7.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 001593  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2015 TAGS: PARM PREL MNUC KNNP EU IR IS GOI EXTERNALSUBJECT: C-NE4-01083: ISRAELI INTENTIONS REGARDING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM  REF: STATE 26053  Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D).  1. (S) SUMMARY:  Israel sees Iran as the primary threat to its security and sees the enrichment cycle as the "point of no return" for Tehran's nuclear weapons program.  The GOI believes that diplomatic pressure with teeth, such as sanctions, can affect Iranian behavior, and is lobbying the EU-3 and IAEA on details of a permanent suspension agreement.  The Israelis support a unified international front but are concerned that the USG may move toward the EU position. Despite the GOI's focus on the diplomatic track, public and private speculation about possible Israeli air strikes continues.  In weighing the military options, the GOI is aware of significant differences from its successful strike against Iraq's nuclear program in 1981, including an uncertain and dispersed target set, the presence of coalition forces in Iraq and the Gulf, Iranian capabilities to retaliate through Hizballah and terrorism, and the changed strategic environment.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- ---------- The Iranian Threat, "Point of No Return," and Timelines --------------------------------------------- ----------  2. (S) PM Sharon calls Iran "the main threat to Israel" and has recently expressed concern that some states are "getting used to" the idea of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.  Other senior Israeli officials echo this, cautioning that Tehran's nuclear weapons program poses what Mossad Chief Meir Dagan calls an "existential threat" that alters the strategic balance in the region.  3. (C) In a meeting with congressional visitors in December, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz described operation of the enrichment cycle as the "point of no return" for the Iranian program, a view shared by many senior GOI officials.  Mossad Chief Dagan went a step further, saying that the Iranian program will be unstoppable once it no longer requires outside assistance to complete the enrichment process.  At the technical level, the director for external affairs at the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) told poloff that the critical step would be Iran's operation of a centrifuge enrichment cascade.  4. (S) GOI officials have given different timelines for when they believe Iran will have full enrichment capability.  In February, PM Sharon told the Secretary that he believes there is still time remaining to pressure Iran, but that the window of opportunity is closing quickly.  DefMin Mofaz cautioned that Iran is "less than one year away," while the head of research in military intelligence estimated that Iran would reach this point by early 2007.  Technical experts at the IAEC predicted that Iran would have enrichment capability within six months of the end of the suspension agreement.  A few GOI officials admitted informally that these estimates need to be taken with caution.  The head of the MFA's strategic affairs division recalled that GOI assessments from 1993 predicted that Iran would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 at the latest.  -------------------------------------------- Focus on Diplomacy and Concern with the EU-3 --------------------------------------------  5. (S) In the near term, Israel is focused on maintaining diplomatic pressure on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and EU-3.  Sharon defines diplomatic pressure to include UNSC sanctions, e.g. on Iran's airlines and trade, as noted below.  President Katsav has said that Tehran is "very conscious of international opinion."  Other MFA and NSC officials point to the current suspension and to Iranian reaction to the Mykonos case as proof that diplomatic pressure can affect decision-making in Tehran.  6. (S) The Israelis often express disappointment with EU-3 efforts, but see no real alternative at this time.  PM Sharon told reporters on March 10 that Iran uses the negotiations to "play for time."  In private, Sharon, his Cabinet, and military leaders have all complained that the Europeans are "too soft."  Similarly, President Katsav has cautioned that Iran will "cheat" on any commitments it makes.  MFA staff told poloff that they do not believe that the EU-3 effort will be successful in obtaining a permanent suspension or that the Europeans will support effective sanctions against Iran.  7. (C) GOI technical experts said they have been lobbying the Europeans and IAEA on several issues.  First, the GOI would like a clearer and more detailed listing of all activities covered by the suspension, along with timelines for each step.  Second, they want more robust verification measures and greater focus on Iran's denial of access to IAEA inspectors.  Third, the Israelis insist that any final agreement must be endorsed by the UNSC to ensure that noncompliance will be dealt with at an appropriate level. Fourth, Israel is pushing the EU-3 to define benchmarks that would signal a failure of the process, and to identify the concrete consequences of such failure.  8. (C) According to the IAEC, the GOI has urged the Europeans to examine bilateral or EU sanctions with small, but noticeable, economic impacts.  After telling the press on March 10 that "it would probably not be advisable to impose an oil embargo on Iran," PM Sharon advocated trade and flight restrictions.  Lower-level GOI officials said these steps could include restrictions on Iranians studying in Europe, limitations on travel by Iranian scientific personnel, and suspension of landing privileges for Iranian airlines within the EU.  The goal, according to the deputy NSA for foreign affairs, is unified pressure from the EU, Russia, and U.S. for a "complete, full, verifiable cessation of the fuel cycle program."  In the short term, this means a full suspension of all enrichment, reprocessing, heavy-water-reactor construction, and related R activities.  --------------------------------------------- -- Israeli Preference for USG and UNSC Involvement --------------------------------------------- --  9. (C) In light of their uneasiness with EU-3 efforts, the Israelis are hoping for robust U.S. involvement and action by the UNSC.  PM Sharon has urged the EU-3 to continue its efforts, but also stressed the importance of preparing to take Iran to the UNSC.  In a meeting with a CoDel on December 12, DefMin Mofaz pushed for the U.S. to take the lead with the Europeans and pursue all diplomatic solutions, including sanctions.  President Katsav asked the Secretary not to "wait for the Europeans."  10. (C) This desire for U.S. activity is amplified by the extremely limited options open to Israel on the diplomatic front.  The IAEC's director for non-proliferation admitted that the GOI sees "little we can do" to increase pressure on Iran as long as Tehran abides by the suspension agreement. The MFA's office director for the Gulf states said that Israel would maintain its low-profile diplomatic activities, such as supplying IAEA members with intelligence material related to the Iranian program.  She said the MFA believes that any overt Israeli pressure would backfire, leading to a surge of Arab support for Iran and focusing attention on Israel's own nuclear activities.  11. (C) Following the recent announcements on Iran by the President and the Secretary, several Israeli officials asked if the USG is shifting its policy on Iran.  The deputy NSA for foreign affairs acknowledged that the U.S. move is probably necessary to build international consensus for taking Iran to the UNSC.  At the same time, he expressed concern that the USG would be influenced by what he called the EU's habit of granting concessions to Iran prior to full compliance.  Mid-level staffers at the NSC and IAEC were also disquieted by U.S. press reports claiming that the USG is re-examining its position on Hizballah.  ------------------------------------------ The Military Option: Bushehr is not Osirak ------------------------------------------  12. (S) Despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts, Israeli officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible military options.  In public, PM Sharon has stressed the importance of the "political and economic" track.  During a recent discussion with a visiting USG official, IDF Deputy Chief of Staff (and CoS-designate) Major General Dani Haloutz similarly said "we don't want to go there."  In February, President Katsav told the Secretary that "the military option is not necessary -- bring the issue to the Security Council."  13. (S) Public speculation about possible military strikes usually focuses on the differences from the Israeli Air Force's attack on Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981.  In private, GOI officials have acknowledged that several factors would make any attack against Iran a much more difficult mission. A senior military intelligence official told the Embassy that the GOI does not know where all of the targets are located and said that any attack would only delay, not end, the Iranian program.  The MFA's office director for the Gulf states noted that potential target sites are well dispersed throughout the country, with several located in built-up civilian areas.  The IAEC stressed the importance of Russian assistance in restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions and said that any attack on Bushehr would likely result in Russian casualties and endanger Moscow's cooperation.  14. (C) MFA contacts said that the distance to the targets and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and the Gulf raise additional complications.  An Israeli assault would necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in Iraq, they maintained, leaving the USG open to retaliation throughout the Islamic world, especially in Iraq.  MFA and NSC officials acknowledged that any attack would also elicit a strong response from Arab states and the Palestinians, effectively freezing the peace process.  15. (C) The Israelis realize that Iran would use any military strike as an excuse to cease cooperation with the EU-3 and the IAEA.  In addition, the GOI is acutely aware of Iran's ability to retaliate, both militarily and through attacks by its regional surrogates.  PM Sharon has claimed that Hizballah has 11,000 rockets (and possibly UAVs) capable of reaching Israel from launching sites in Lebanon.  The MFA's office director for the Gulf states said that she believed that Iran would retaliate by inciting terrorist groups in Israel and the Occupied Territories.  16. (C) Current USG, EU-3, and IAEA focus on Iran also creates a situation that differs from 1981, when the Israelis felt that the international community was ignoring the Iraqi threat.  Israelis hope that the others will solve the Iranian problem for them, or as Vice PM Shimon Peres has said, "I do not think that the matter of Iran needs to be turned into an Israeli problem -- it is a matter of concern for the whole world."  --------------------------------------------- -- Comment: Diplomatic Solution Preferred, but ... --------------------------------------------- --  17. (S) COMMENT: The Israelis are focusing on diplomatic channels in the IAEA and EU-3, and appear to have very real concerns about the feasibility of military strikes against the Iranian nuclear program.  Nevertheless, the GOI has shown time and again that it will act militarily if it believes that its security is threatened, and the IDF is most certainly keeping contingency plans up to date.  The Israeli press reported that in February PM Sharon's Security Cabinet had given "initial authorization" for an attack on Iran.  The press reports cited an unnamed "Israeli security source," who claimed that the USG would "authorize" an Israeli attack. Post notes that it may not be possible to detect preparations for any military strike.  Air defense operations would pose nearly perfect cover for civil defense and Air Force activities preceding any attack.  Due to both the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the GOI's near inability to prevent leaks, any attack order would be closely held, probably even from many members of PM Sharon's Cabinet.  18. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The GOI knows that we share its interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, we should expect continued Israeli lobbying at the highest levels urging the USG to ensure that the EU-3 effort is on track and backed by a solid international front.  We will also hear Israeli concerns that the U.S. position may move toward the EU stance.  At the same time, we should recognize that Israeli intelligence briefings will understandably focus on worst-case scenarios and may not match current USG assessments.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv  You can also access this site through the State Department's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** KURTZER

ABU DHABI 909 (NOTAL)  Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S) Summary. Embassy Abu Dhabi looks forward to welcoming you to the UAE on April 23.  In the aftermath of the controversy of the Dubai Ports World acquisition of P, your assurances to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ), your host for the visit, that the USG values the UAE as an ally and friend will be well received.  While you should commend the UAE for its assistance and cooperation, you should take advantage of your luncheon with MbZ and his brother, State Security Director Sheikh Hazza, to push the UAE on several areas of interest to the USG: counterterrorism, counter terror finance, Iran, Hamas, Iraq, and ideological extremism (each is covered in the scenesetter).  The UAE remains a committed partner in the global war on terror, but it continues to take an ad hoc approach to countering terrorism that "solves" the problem for the UAE locally, but fails to contribute on a transnational basis.  In January, the U.S. and the UAE held the first meeting of the Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee (JTFCC), but the discussions were not as detailed or as robust as the U.S. delegation anticipated.  Treasury U/S Levey will return to the UAE to hold a second meeting April 30 that will focus on cash couriers and charities.  2. (S) Although the UAE regards Iran as one of its most serious threats to national security, UAE officials are reluctant to take actions that could anger their neighbor and compromise their extensive trading relationship.  At the same time, we are seeing more of a willingness on the part of the UAE to support USG initiatives without the full approval of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  As tensions escalate between Iran and the international community, the UAE is growing increasingly nervous.  The UAE leadership--which has told us they consider Hamas a terrorist organization--plans to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.  The UAE has taken an active role in encouraging Sunni participation in the Iraqi political process and it continues to condemn the sectarian violence that is preventing stabilization of the country.  In the face of growing ideological extremism in the Gulf, the UAE leadership is politically determined not to allow Islamist extremists to gain a foothold on UAE soil.  End Summary.  Counterterrorism Efforts ------------------------  3. (S) The UAE is concerned about the terrorist threat to the UAE, but lacks a comprehensive implementation strategy for reducing its vulnerability (ref A).  The UAE considers homeland security one of its top priorities, but rather than prioritizing national security projects, its efforts have focused on contracting risk assessments, forming committees, and procuring equipment.  The UAE has also aggressively tried to prevent the radicalization of UAE nationals and Arab/South Asian expatriates.  UAE officials publicly and strongly condemn extremism and terrorist attacks, anti-extremism has been the focus of government-approved Friday sermons in the mosques, and the UAE ministry of Education has modernized the Islamic studies curriculum in its schools.  4. (S) The UAEG government reacts quickly when presented with evidence of a terrorist presence inside the UAE, but does not approach the problem from a transnational manner.  The UAE's immediate response when terrorists pose a risk is to deport them.  UAE agencies do not investigate fully to see how far the problem goes or whether there is an international network involved.  Although the U.S./UAE counterterrorism cooperation is strong (with the UAE working closely with the USG on specific cases), Emiratis do not consistently share lead information found in the possession of individuals in their custody with each other or with the U.S. Government.  These tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services' ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and planned attacks.  The UAE's insistence on deportation as a solution does not protect the country long-term or truly address the nature and scope of the problem.  The UAEG must be willing to take action against Emirati nationals, it must investigate fully, and it must share information with other Gulf countries and with the USG.  5. (S) The only way to generate significant change in the UAE on the issue of counterterrorism is to convince the senior leadership that it needs to continue to display political will and commitment in tackling the terror challenge with a transnational approach.  MbZ is the person most able to elicit this type of change.  Embassy recommends you have a frank and forthright discussion during your meeting with MbZ and his younger brother, Hazza, to encourage this type of change.  Although you should commend them for the UAE's CT efforts and cooperation, you should also encourage them to be personally involved in developing a more effective and fully cooperative counterterrorism posture.  Counterterrorism Finance ------------------------  6. (S) The UAE has made significant strides in regulating the financial sector against money laundering and terrorist financing (ref B).  Although the UAE now has a strong legal framework in place, it must turn its efforts to enforcement. It is imperative that UAE authorities investigate and prosecute violators of terror finance/anti-money laundering, cash courier, and charity laws and regulations.  To date, investigation and prosecution has been weak.  In an effort to increase U.S. and UAE cooperation on terrorist financing, the first meeting of the U.S/UAE Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee (JTFCC) was held in Abu Dhabi on January 24, 2005 (ref C).  The UAE team had representatives from the Central Bank, State Security, Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Justice.  However, no one participated from Dubai.  In order for the JTFCC to be an effective committee, Dubai's Police, State Security, Customs, and the Department of Islamic Affairs and Charities must participate.  Embassy is coordinating a second meeting April 30 that will focus on cash couriers and charity regulations.  Iran ----  7. (S/NF) UAE leaders are very concerned about escalating tensions between Iran and the international community.  The UAE feels vulnerable--as evidenced by the fact that its leaders frequently note that Iran is "very near" the UAE. Commercial ties between Dubai and Iran are significant (Dubai is Iran's largest non-oil trading partner), and as a result the UAEG walks a fine line between maintaining and encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected Iranian proliferation activities.  Although the UAEG is worried about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its short-term policy decisions regarding Iran center on not provoking its neighbor.  The USG has approached the UAEG four times since January, asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected of going to Iran's nuclear and/or missile programs.  None of those instances have resulted in a successful interdiction. In the first two instances UAE officials simply refused to take action (refs F and G).  The Director of Dubai's State Security Organization explained during the 11 February U.S./UAE Counterproliferation Task Force meeting that the decision to not inspect the containers had been a political decision based on the UAE's concern that Iran might retaliate (ref H).  In the two later instances (ref K), ships that had been scheduled to arrive in Dubai went directly to Bandar Abbas.  8. (S) In recent meetings with senior USG officials, MbZ has expressed clear support for U.S. initiatives against Iran. MbZ and UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid agreed with Secretary Rice February 23 about the need to counter Iran's growing influence in the region and its nuclear ambitions, although they specified that any sanctions should target the key Iranian leadership, not the Iranian people (ref I).  MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that he did not think it was necessary to wait for all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to agree before proceeding with any plans against Iran (ref E).  "Whoever is interested in getting on board ship should be encouraged," he said.  "I don't think it's logical or smart to wait for everyone to get involved so we can sail. ... If another GCC member believes it's not right, that's his choice."  In the Arab region, MbZ specifically identified Bahrain and Jordan as two countries that also view Iran as a threat and that are "capable to work with us."  He told A/S Welch that the UAE would prepare a paper responding to USG concerns about Iran and mechanisms for addressing the challenge posed by Iran. In a March 27 meeting with CENTCOM Commander General Abizaid, MbZ spoke about the Iranian threat with a greater sense of urgency.  He was strongly in favor of taking action against Iran and its president sooner rather than later.  "I believe this guy is going to take us to war. ... It's a matter of time," MbZ warned, adding that action against Iran and President Ahmedinejad should be taken this year or next year.  MbZ said he was unwilling to wait much longer.  "Personally, I cannot risk it with a guy like Ahmedinejad.  He is young and aggressive."  9. (S/NF) SSD Director Hazza told A/S Welch March 29 that the Ayatollah Ali Khameini had once issued a fatwa prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons by Iran, but noted that this should not be considered a guarantee.  Hazza assessed that Iran is also a threat due to its ties to international terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida, as well as their financial support to Hamas.  He added that the relationship between Iran and Syria, and their links to Hizballah, was also of concern, as was Iran's attempts to expand its influence in Iraq and elsewhere in the world.  MbZ also expressed to A/S Welch March 28 the concern that Hizballah was supporting Hamas.  During your meeting, you should explain the graduated approach to addressing Iran in the United Nations Security Council and encourage the UAE to isolate Iran--regardless of potential economic backlash.  You should also explain the importance of the UAE working closely with the USG on interdiction requests.  This meeting will be a good follow-on to the discussion U/S Joseph had with Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan (AbZ) on April 8, where Joseph outlined the USG's policy priorities for Iran (septel).  (Note: While AbZ, like MbZ, expressed support for U.S. initiatives against Iran, he stated that the USG should come to the UAE as a "very last resort. ... If you can solve something without involving the UAE, please do so."  End Note.)  Palestinian Territories/Hamas -----------------------------  10. (S) UAE leaders have told us that they consider Hamas a terrorist organization and that they would not fund Hamas unless they denounce violence (refs D and E).  However, after Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal visited Abu Dhabi on March 22 and met with UAE Minister of Presidential Affairs Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Sha'ali, Meshaal publicly claimed that the UAEG had pledged to continue to provide financial assistance to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (ref J). MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that the UAEG allowed Meshaal to come, but that "officially, we don't recognize Khaled Meshaal."  MbZ said that once a new Palestinian Prime Minister is selected, UAEG officials will travel to the Palestinian territories to ascertain that UAEG assistance is "going to the right people."  UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid sounded a note of optimism when he told Secretary Rice February 23 that Hamas, "with some pressure," would understand the need to respect the will of the international community.  11. (S) The UAE has historically provided significant financial assistance to the Palestinian people.  Typically, the UAE sends aid to the Palestinian territories through charity organizations, or by projectized assistance; but the UAEG has also provided financial assistance directly to the Palestinian Authority, most recently $20 million in March 2006 to Mahmoud Abbas for salaries.  In the wake of the Hamas electoral victory, UAE leaders told us they intend to honor their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance (including the $100 million Sheikh Khalifa housing complex that was announced last year).  12. (S/NF) In his meeting with A/S Welch March 29, SSD Director Hazza assessed that there was both a positive and a negative side to the Hamas election win.  On the negative side, he cited Hamas' position with regard to Israel, and their violent agenda.  On the positive side, Hazza noted the fact that Hamas was now in power and was accountable to the international community.  He spoke to A/S Welch of the threat posed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hazza also asked A/S Welch how the USG would react to those countries that did support the Hamas government, and whether they would run afoul of U.S. laws restricting support to terrorist organizations. A/S Welch replied that that would be a problem, emphasizing that no money should go to the government unless Hamas renounced violence and accepted Israel.  A/S Welch also told Hazza that it was not the responsibility of the U.S. or other Arab countries to pay the salaries of the new Hamas government, underscoring the need for Hamas to show accountability.  MbZ told A/S Welch that Hamas benefited from "official and private contributions" from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  MbZ said it was "easy to take $1 million in a suitcase" to Lebanon, alluding to cash couriers.  Iraq ----  13. (S/NF) A partner in the war on terror, the UAE continues to provide U.S. forces access, overflight clearances, and other critical logistical assistance to Operation Iraqi Freedom (and Operation Enduring Freedom).  The UAE has also been a helpful supporter of Iraq's burgeoning political process.  It has worked with Iraqi political and religious figures to encourage greater Sunni integration, and it has consulted with Ambassador Khalilzad on a number of occasions about the need to stem sectarianism in Iraq.  The UAE has publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence in Iraq, most recently, the February 22 bombing of the al-Askariya Shrine.  MbZ and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid expressed their concerns about Iran's interference in Iraq's internal affairs to Secretary Rice during her visit to Abu Dhabi February 23.  MbZ further told General Abizaid that discontent with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Ja'afari was creating volunteers for al-Qaida.  He pledged the UAE's support to the fight against al-Qaida.  In his meeting with A/S Welch, MbZ advocated using the Arabic language media to tell Iraqis the truth about how many of their own people are dying at the hands of the insurgents.  If Iraqis were to see the figures, he opined, they would conclude that support of the insurgency is "not worth it."  Ideological Extremism ---------------------  14. (S) MbZ and his brothers continue to be outspoken on the issue of Muslim extremists and the threat they pose to the region.  MbZ underscored for A/S Welch the UAE's preferred approach of denying extremists a foothold rather than allowing them to play a role in the political process. Although he warns of the dangers of free elections in countries with a well-organized Muslim Brotherhood presence, he tells USG guests that the UAE will go ahead with elections.  The Emirati leadership has told us that they will not allow Islamists to participate in elections.  (Note: The UAE has announced that half of the members of the Federal National Council would be elected while half would continue to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates. Despite this announcement, the UAE still lags behind other Gulf states in terms of democratization.  End Note.)  MbZ also sees extremist ideology threatening the educational system, where he and his brothers are spending considerable resources to modernize the curriculum and the teaching corps. SISON

(S) Summary. Embassy Abu Dhabi looks forward to welcoming you to the UAE on May 7.  U.S. and UAE officials have had a number of productive meetings on the topic of counterterrorism, the most recent of which came on April 22, when Fran Townsend, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, met over lunch with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) and his brother, Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ).  Your visit builds on our ongoing dialogue and efforts to push the UAE on several areas of interest to the USG: counterterrorism, counter terror finance, Iran, Hamas, Iraq, and ideological extremism (each is covered in the scenesetter).  We have requested separate meetings with Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ), whom you met in New York last September, and State Security Director Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed, whom Deputy Coordinator Urbancic met last October.  In your meetings, you should commend the UAE for its assistance and cooperation, including its strong condemnation of the April 24 bomb attack in Dahab.  The UAE remains a committed partner in the global war on terror, but it continues to take an ad hoc approach to countering terrorism that "solves" the problem for the UAE locally, but fails to contribute on a transnational basis.  In January, the U.S. and the UAE held the first meeting of the Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee (JTFCC).  Treasury U/S Levey is currently in the UAE to hold a second meeting that will focus on cash couriers and charities.  2. (S) Although the UAE regards Iran as one of its most serious threats to national security, UAE officials are reluctant to take actions that could provoke their neighbor and compromise their extensive trading relationship.  At the same time, we are seeing more of a willingness on the part of the UAE to support USG initiatives without the full approval of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  As tensions escalate between Iran and the international community, the UAE is growing increasingly nervous.  The UAE leadership, which has told us they consider Hamas a terrorist organization, plans to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.  The UAE has taken an active role in encouraging Sunni participation in the Iraqi political process and continues to condemn the sectarian violence that is preventing stabilization of the country.  In the face of growing ideological extremism in the Gulf, the UAE leadership is politically determined not to allow Islamist extremists to gain a foothold on UAE soil.  End Summary.  Counterterrorism Efforts ------------------------  3. (S) The UAE is concerned about the terrorist threat to the UAE, but lacks a comprehensive implementation strategy for reducing its vulnerability (ref A).  The UAE considers homeland security one of its top priorities, but rather than prioritizing national security projects, its efforts have focused on contracting risk assessments, forming committees, and procuring equipment.  In your meetings, we recommend that you inquire about the government's plan, announced by President Khalifa in December 2005, to place all the security agencies under a newly established National Security Council.  MbZ, asked by Townsend if the UAE was worried about its oil infrastructure, responded emphatically, "absolutely."  He told Townsend that there are three international companies currently conducting risk assessments of the UAE oil infrastructure and maritime security for the UAEG.  Townsend offered U.S. assistance in helping the UAE to reduce its vulnerability (ref O).  4. (S) The UAEG reacts quickly when presented with evidence of a terrorist presence inside the UAE, but does not approach the problem from a transnational posture.  The UAE's immediate response when terrorists pose a risk is to deport them.  UAE agencies do not investigate fully to see how far the problem goes or whether there is an international network involved.  Although the U.S./UAE counterterrorism cooperation is strong (with the UAE working closely with the USG on specific cases), Emiratis do not consistently share lead information found in the possession of individuals in their custody with each other or with the U.S. Government.  These tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services' ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and planned attacks.  The UAE's insistence on deportation as a solution does not protect the country long-term or truly address the nature and scope of the problem.  Townsend discussed this matter with MbZ and urged the UAE to instead to fully investigate terror suspects and share the results of those inquiries with the USG. Counterterrorism Finance ------------------------  5. (S) The UAE has made significant strides in regulating the financial sector against money laundering and terrorist financing (ref B).  Although the UAE now has a strong legal framework in place, it must turn its efforts to enforcement. It is imperative that UAE authorities investigate and prosecute violators of terror finance/anti-money laundering, cash courier, and charity laws and regulations.  To date, investigation and prosecution have been weak.  In an effort to increase U.S. and UAE cooperation on terrorist financing, the first meeting of the U.S/UAE Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee (JTFCC) was held in Abu Dhabi on January 24, 2005 (ref C).  The UAE team had representatives from the Central Bank, State Security, Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Justice.  However, no one participated from Dubai.  In order for the JTFCC to be an effective committee, Dubai's Police, State Security, Customs, and the Department of Islamic Affairs and Charities must participate.  The April 30 meeting will focus on cash couriers and charity regulations.  Iran ----  6. (S/NF) UAE leaders are very concerned about escalating tensions between Iran and the international community.  AbZ publicly expressed his country's concern, and the entire region's "vulnerability," at a press conference in Kuwait April 25, while urging a peaceful resolution (ref M). Commercial ties between Dubai and Iran are significant (Dubai is Iran's largest non-oil trading partner), and as a result the UAEG walks a fine line between maintaining and encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected Iranian proliferation activities.  Although the UAEG is worried about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its short-term policy decisions regarding Iran center on not provoking its neighbor.  The USG has approached the UAEG four times since January, asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected of going to Iran's nuclear and/or missile programs.  None of those instances has resulted in a successful interdiction. In the first two instances UAE officials simply refused to take action (refs F and G).  The Director of Dubai's State Security Organization explained during the 11 February U.S./UAE Counterproliferation Task Force meeting that the decision not to inspect the containers had been a political decision based on the UAE's concern that Iran might retaliate (ref H).  In the two later instances (ref K), ships that had been scheduled to arrive in Dubai went directly to Bandar Abbas.  AbZ told U/S Joseph during his April 8 visit to Abu Dhabi that the USG should approach the UAE on interdiction requests "only as a last resort" (ref N).  Two weeks later, he assured Townsend that the UAEG does not want Iran to take advantage of the UAE's open trading environment.  He said the UAE was in the final stages of ratifying its export control law and that it would be announced "soon."  In an encouraging development, the UAE on April 15 privately endorsed the Proliferation Security Initiative's Statement of Interdiction Principles (ref L).  7. (S) In recent meetings with senior USG officials, Abu Dhabi's ruling family has expressed clear support for U.S. initiatives against Iran.  The U.S. and UAE have a "common desire to succeed," AbZ told U/S Joseph, noting that the combination of Iran and terrorism is something that cannot be tolerated.  "The threat from al-Qa'ida would be minor if Iran has nukes," AbZ said (ref N).  MbZ told Townsend April 22 that the Iranians think that the U.S. will not do anything about their recent declaration that they have successfully enriched uranium.  He added that he thought the Iranians were wrong.  MbZ and UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid agreed with Secretary Rice February 23 about the need to counter Iran's growing influence in the region and its nuclear ambitions, although they specified that any sanctions should target the key Iranian leadership, not the Iranian people (ref I).  MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that he did not think it was necessary to wait for all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to agree before proceeding with any U.S. plans against Iran (ref E).  He told A/S Welch that the UAE would prepare a paper responding to USG concerns about Iran and mechanisms for addressing the challenge posed by Iran.  In a March 27 meeting with CENTCOM Commander General Abizaid, MbZ spoke about the Iranian threat with a greater sense of urgency.  He was strongly in favor of taking action against Iran and its president sooner rather than later.  "I believe this guy is going to take us to war. ... It's a matter of time," MbZ warned, adding that action against Iran and President Ahmedinejad should be taken this year or next year.  8. (S/NF) SSD Director Hazza told A/S Welch March 29 that the Ayatollah Ali Khameini had once issued a fatwa prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons by Iran, but noted that this should not be considered a guarantee.  Hazza assessed that Iran is also a threat due to its ties to international terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida, as well as their financial support to Hamas.  He added that the relationship between Iran and Syria, and their links to Hizballah, was also of concern, as was Iran's attempts to expand its influence in Iraq and elsewhere in the world.  MbZ also expressed to A/S Welch March 28 the concern that Hizballah was supporting Hamas.  During your meetings, you should explain the graduated approach to addressing Iran in the United Nations Security Council and encourage the UAE to isolate Iran--regardless of potential economic backlash.  You should also explain the importance of the UAE working closely with the USG on interdiction requests.  These meetings will be a good follow-on to the discussion U/S Joseph had with AbZ April 8, when Joseph outlined the USG's policy priorities for Iran.  (Note: While AbZ, like MbZ, expressed support for U.S. initiatives against Iran, he stated that the USG should come to the UAE as a "very last resort. ... If you can solve something without involving the UAE, please do so."  End Note.)  Palestinian Territories/Hamas -----------------------------  9. (S) UAE leaders have told us that they consider Hamas a terrorist organization and that they would not fund Hamas unless they denounce violence (refs D and E).  However, after Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal visited Abu Dhabi on March 22 and met with UAE Minister of Presidential Affairs Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Sha'ali, Meshaal publicly claimed that the UAEG had pledged to continue to provide financial assistance to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (ref J). MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that the UAEG allowed Meshaal to come, but that "officially, we don't recognize Khaled Meshaal."  MbZ said that once a new Palestinian Prime Minister is selected, UAEG officials will travel to the Palestinian territories to ascertain that UAEG assistance is "going to the right people."  In his meeting with Townsend, MbZ said that the UAE "felt the Muslim Brotherhood rally behind Hamas" after its electoral victory in the Palestinian territories, and that the Hamas victory should be a lesson to the West.  UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid sounded a note of optimism when he told Secretary Rice February 23 that Hamas, "with some pressure,"  SIPDIS would understand the need to respect the will of the international community.  10. (S) The UAE has historically provided significant financial assistance to the Palestinian people.  Typically, the UAE sends aid to the Palestinian territories through charity organizations, or by projectized assistance; but the UAEG has also provided financial assistance directly to the Palestinian Authority, most recently $20 million in March 2006 to Mahmoud Abbas for salaries.  In the wake of the Hamas electoral victory, UAE leaders told us they intend to honor their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance (including the $100 million Sheikh Khalifa housing complex that was announced last year).  11. (S/NF) In his meeting with A/S Welch March 29, SSD Director Hazza assessed that there was both a positive and a negative side to the Hamas election win.  On the negative side, he cited Hamas' position with regard to Israel, and their violent agenda.  On the positive side, Hazza noted the fact that Hamas was now in power and was accountable to the international community.  He spoke to A/S Welch of the threat posed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hazza also asked A/S Welch how the USG would react to those countries that did support the Hamas government, and whether they would run afoul of U.S. laws restricting support to terrorist organizations. A/S Welch replied that that would be a problem, emphasizing that no money should go to the government unless Hamas renounced violence and accepted Israel.  A/S Welch also told Hazza that it was not the responsibility of the U.S. or other Arab countries to pay the salaries of the new Hamas government, underscoring the need for Hamas to show accountability.  MbZ told A/S Welch that Hamas benefited from "official and private contributions" from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  MbZ said it was "easy to take $1 million in a suitcase" to Lebanon, alluding to cash couriers.  Iraq ----  12. (S/NF) A partner in the war on terror, the UAE continues to provide U.S. forces access, overflight clearances, and other critical logistical assistance to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  The UAE has also been a helpful supporter of Iraq's burgeoning political process.  It has worked with Iraqi political and religious figures to encourage greater Sunni integration, and it has consulted with Ambassador Khalilzad on a number of occasions about the need to stem sectarianism in Iraq.  The UAE has publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence in Iraq, most recently, the February 22 bombing of the al-Askariya Shrine.  MbZ told Townsend that he had "no confidence" in the new Iraqi Prime Minister-designate, Jawad al-Maliki, and he reiterated his concern about Iran's meddling in Iraq's internal affairs.  He has pledged the UAE's support to the fight against al-Qaida.  Ideological Extremism ---------------------  13. (S) The Abu Dhabi ruling family continue to be outspoken on the issue of Muslim extremists and the threat they pose to the region.  MbZ told Townsend that if there were an election in Dubai tomorrow, the Muslim Brotherhood would take over. He said the challenge is to find a way to remove the extremists in a way that they never come back.  One way he and his brothers have been trying to accomplish this is by reforming the education system, which they say was penetrated by the Muslim Brotherhood in the late 1960s.  (Note: The UAE has announced that half of the members of the Federal National Council would be elected while half would continue to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates. Despite this announcement, the UAE still lags behind other Gulf states in terms of democratization.  End Note.)  UAE officials publicly and strongly condemn extremism and terrorist attacks, anti-extremism has been the focus of government-approved Friday sermons in the mosques. SISON
C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004688  SIPDIS  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2021 TAGS: PGOV PINR PREL TUSUBJECT: TURKEY'S FOREIGN POLICY SPLIT - THE PM'S CIRCLE TO THE FORE   Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney, reasons 1.4 (b), (d)  1.(C)  The long-standing split between the professional MFA diplomats and the tight circle of advisers around PM Erdogan has widened noticeably in recent weeks.  This gap has existed under Erdogan,s Justice and Development Party (AKP) government, largely because of the close links that both PM Erdogan and FM Gul have with PM adviser Davutoglu, who has been willing to undertake numerous initiatives.  Until recently, however, such strains have usually been more effectively papered over.  This internal debate now affects every step the GOT takes on the international stage.  2.(C) The Turkish diplomatic corps is highly educated and well attuned to what will sell in the U.S. or Europe; less so on the domestic political front.  PM Erdogan,s core of AKP advisers, including Davutoglu and the AKP vice chairs, understand what will play well with their constituencies. Their sense of how policy will play outside of Ankara is handicapped, however, by their Turkey- and Islam-centric vision of how they want the world to operate.  3. (C/NF)  Decoupling MFA from the PM,s advisers can produce a greater willingness to take chances.  At the same time, it can also create greater room for misunderstandings or wrongfooted efforts.  In the run-up to the February 2006 Hamas visit to Ankara, for example, MFA was kept in the dark.  The AKPers who dealt with the visit did so in a haphazard and uncoordinated manner.  MFA, uninformed, was unable to preview it with us.  The backlash from the U.S. in particular truly took AKP aback.  It took weeks -) even months -) before limited understanding dawned on the depth of the displeasure the Hamas venture had spawned, and why.  It did not (and still does not) fit within their frame of reference.   4. (C/NF)  Most startling, perhaps, to AKP were those in the U.S. and elsewhere who, in the aftermath of the Hamas visit, asked how AKP would feel if we met with PKK leaders.  For Erdogan,s circle, it is not analogous: for them, terrorism equals the PKK.  It is difficult for PM Erdogan to believe that his philanthropist Islamic friend Al Kadi could be involved in terrorist financing, just as it is alien to their frame of reference to view specific Islamic groups as terrorists.  Hamas and Hizballah are the result of western policies gone awry, a response from desperate people )- not truly terrorists.  Allow them to talk reason to these people, exert Turkish influence, and the Hamases of the world will change.  This has been evident in other Turkish efforts throughout the region as well -- with Iran (FM Mottaki,s visit here; Erdogan,s talks with Ahmedinejad on the margins of international conferences); with Syria (the Turks believe they were instrumental in getting Syria,s Asad to agree to pull troops out of Lebanon, and to certain aspects of the Hariri investigation); with the current conflict in Lebanon and the Gaza strip.  5.(C/NF) A more recent example of the PM circle-MFA disconnect involved Davutoglu,s trip to Damascus the first week of July, where he met not only with Asad but Misha,al as well.  The MFA was cut out and furious (their Ambassador to Damascus reportedly cooled his heels outside while Davutoglu met with Asad).  6.(C) As the Israel-Lebanon crisis intensified, so has this tendency within Erdogan,s small circle.  AKP sees own its back to the public opinion wall.  Instead of exercising leadership, Erdogan -- in populist pre-election mode -- has followed.  He is playing to AKP,s constituency; to those within the party who have never been positively inclined toward Israel; and to the greater regional Sunni audience that he is trying to court.  Two early results, aimed at these audiences, were (1) the PM,s participation in the August 3 extraordinary OIC executive council meetin in Kuala Lumpur, where he again met with Irnian president Ahmedinejad and uttered strong anti-Israeli statements; and (2) FM Gul,s August 3 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, which aired GOT ire in an unhelpful way and blindsided the professional Turkish diplomats in Washington.  7.(C/NF) Complicit or not (we believe the former), Gul has had his name sullied by a number of these efforts.  He  will have to decide whether to give the MFA renewed weight -)  Foreign Ministry officials could be key in bridging certain delicate issues, particularly Cyprus, with both the government and the military, for example -) or go with the PM,s circle.

(C) Summary:  President Aliyev stated to the Ambassador that the USG and international community's policy towards Iran has "failed," that Iran is "confident, comfortable, and unconstrained," that he "does not understand USG policy on Iran" and, consequently, Azerbaijan's policy must be to "minimize potential risks" to Azerbaijan.  Aliyev also said that Iranian President Ahmadinejad has affirmed that he has "burned his bridges" on the nuclear issue and warned Aliyev directly that Iran will "attack from where it is attacked." President Aliyev believes it is "always possible Iran will do something against us."  President Aliyev's foreign policy advisor and the Foreign Minister have voiced similar concerns; the Foreign Minister has again told the Ambassador that Iran is planning various scenarios in response to heightened tensions or military action, which the GOAJ believes will include a provocation against Azerbaijani interests on the Caspian, where the international legal framework remains unclear.  A recent anti-Azerbaijani editorial which appeared in the Iranian newspaper Jomhouri Eslami (reported incorrectly in the Azerbaijani press as having been written by Supreme Leader Khamenei) appears to be driving much of the GOAJ's concerns.  In sum, the GOAJ at the most senior levels has communicated to us in stark terms their concern about the implications for Azerbaijani security of the current situation in Iran, and their desire to better understand USG policy to address it - and its implications. This will impact our ability to work with the GOAJ on a range of issues; we need to address their concern.  End Summary.  ------------------------ President Aliyev on Iran ------------------------  2.  (C) In a 23 November one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador, President Aliyev raised in stark terms his view that USG and the international community's policy on Iran has "failed" and that Iran is "confident, comfortable, and unconstrained."  Aliyev said that he "does not understand USG policy" in response to this situation, adding that Ahmadinejad has affirmed he has "burned his bridges" on the nuclear issue and warned Aliyev directly that Iran will "attack from where it is attacked."  Aliyev said he believes it is "always possible Iran will do something against us" (ref a) and Azerbaijan's policy must be to minimize potential risks to itself.  Also as reported earlier, Aliyev's Foreign Policy Advisor (ref b) and Foreign Minister Mammadyarov have voiced similar concerns.  In a December 14 one-on-one meeting, Foreign Minister told the Ambassador again that Iran is planning various scenarios to respond to heightened tensions or military action, which Azerbaijan believes will include a provocation against Azerbaijani interests on the Caspian, where the international legal framework remains unclear.  ------------------------------------ Foreign Minister Mammadyarov on Iran ------------------------------------  3.  (C) In a December 14 one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Minister Mammadyarov said that recent Iranian activities (the fueling of demonstrations in Nardaran with respect to the anti-Islam article published in Sanat, recent demonstrations in front of the Azerbaijani Consulate General and Embassy - ref c) are intended to "send a message to us that they won't wait" while Azerbaijan moves towards NATO and the US, and on a possible resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.  He pointed to a recent statement by Supreme Leader Khamenei that "Azerbaijan should not feel comfortable with respect to NATO," saying Iran is "watching our policy in this area very carefully."  In addition, he said Iran "doesn't want us to make a move towards conflict resolution because they know the conflict is the only serious problem" facing Azerbaijan, and that if continued it keeps Azerbaijan off base and under pressure.  He also said that Russia's and Iran's positions on this are very close.  4.  (C) Mammadyarov repeated what he had told the Ambassador some months ago, that the Iranians are developing different "scenarios" for how they will react if the US or Israel  BAKU 00001835  002.2 OF 003   increase the pressure on Iran over the nuclear issue. Mammadyarov feels that Azerbaijan is a "target" for Iran if there is the possibility of military action against Iran, which Iran "definitely" sees as being on the table.  The GOAJ thinks that a provocation of some kind on the Caspian will be Iran's likely approach because whatever overt step Iran takes, it will want to be within the framework of international law, Mammadyarov said.  There is no agreement on Caspian delimitation, the international legal framework is murky and "that is where Azerbaijan is vulnerable."  However, Mammadyarov also said that Azerbaijan believes Iran is preparing scenarios for responses with respect to Lebanon, Iraq and "even in Syria."  Iran is "afraid of the Taliban" and hence slow to consider any steps in Afghanistan.  Iran may also create difficulties with respect to its land border with Nakhchivan (stopping buses, for example), with the aim of turning the population against the GOAJ and provoking "social problems" in Nakhchivan like those in Georgia. According to Mammadyarov, Azerbaijan is planning to build a railroad from Nakhchivan through Igdir, Turkey, as the next stage of the Kars-Alkhakhalaki-Tbilisi railroad in order to keep Nakhchivan from being cut off by Iran this way.  5.  (C) Mammadyarov feels that Iran does not want Azerbaijan to make a move on N-K resolution because the withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territory will make Azerbaijan stronger in the region.  Mammadyarov believes that Iran does not want Azerbaijan, as a secular Muslim country, to succeed as a model.  Poverty in the ethnic Azeri provinces in the north of Iran is "like the middle ages" and as people travel back and forth from Azerbaijan to Iran the contrast is evident.  Mammadyarov argued that it is in Iran's national interest to see the conflict continue, and, hence, the Iranian government is exerting increased pressure at any sign of steps towards a resolution.  6.  (C)  Speaking to the role of religion, Mammadyarov asserted that Islam in Azerbaijan is more a matter of "tradition" than ideology. Iran started playing with religion with the Sanat article and in Nardaran, hoping for a "uprising" from the people.  When this did not succeed, Mammadyarov said that Iran's next step was the demonstrations at the Azerbaijani Embassy and Consulate General (ref b).  He argued that Iran's aim is to portray the Government of Azerbaijan as bad Muslims, poor followers of Islam. Azerbaijan is going to continue its westward orientation, cooperation with NATO and the US but "without rhetoric to the public," Mammadyarov said.  In Brussels, President Aliyev made clear that Azerbaijan will "continue and deepen our cooperation with NATO," moving to the second phase of its Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP).  Mammadyarov said that President Aliyev believes greater cooperation with NATO and a greater NATO presence and involvement in the region will bring predictability and stability.  He said Aliyev was "very happy" with paragraph 43 of the Riga Summit statement; its language on regional conflicts was a "clear message to everyone north, south, east and west of Azerbaijan;" and, it helps him push back on those of his advisors who question what Azerbaijan gains from cooperation with NATO.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- Supreme Leader Khamenei's Alleged Anti-Azerbaijan Comments --------------------------------------------- -------------  7.  (C) A recent anti-Azerbaijani article which appeared in Jomhouri Eslami, a conservative Tehran daily, appears to have played a key role in raising concerns about Iran within senior GOAJ circles.  The Azerbaijani press (to include the opposition newspaper Azadliq) quoted Supreme Leader Khamenei as having made numerous threats against Azerbaijan, even claiming Azerbaijan to be part of Iran, characterizing it as "Northern Iran" (a pointed dig at Azerbaijanis who refer to Azeri-populated areas of Azerbaijan as "Southern Azerbaijan").  In fact, the Jomhouri Eslami article widely disseminated in the Azerbaijani press was an editorial piece, not an article either written by or quoting the Supreme Leader.  While critical of the Azerbaijani government (focusing on issues such as the Sanat article and closer ties with the US), the original editorial did not threaten Azerbaijan in as dire terms as suggested by the Azerbaijani media with reported quotes such as "we would like to remind politicians in Azerbaijan that the IRI has adequate power to realize the historic will of the people."  -------  BAKU 00001835  003.2 OF 003   Comment -------  8.  (C) Given the complex relations between Azerbaijan and Iran, heated accusations in the press - and even overt threats by Iran - are not uncommon.  The most recent bilateral spat occurred in March 2006, when Iran accused the GOAJ of supporting regime change by hosting in Baku a world congress of Azerbaijanis (including "Southern Azerbaijanis" who roundly criticized the IRI during the conference). However, President Aliyev's and Foreign Minister Mammadyarov's recent statements to the Ambassador reveal increasing levels of GOAJ concern about Iranian intentions and USG policy toward Iran.  Embassy contacts have also noted that the level of Iranian rhetoric is sharper than in the past (although their views likely are based on the somewhat erroneous Azerbaijani press coverage of Iranian editorials). The GOAJ at the most senior levels has communicated to us its in stark terms concern about implications for Azerbaijani security of the current situation in Iran, and their desire to better understand USG policy to address it - and its implications.  This will impact our ability to work with the GOAJ on a range of issues; we need to address their concern. We also note that the GOAJ has regular and broad contacts with Iranian officials and Aliyev and his key advisors, if engaged in regular dialogue, can provide us useful insights on Iranian officials and intentions as seen from Baku.  The Department's guidance on how to respond to Aliyev's concerns is requested. HYLAND
C O N F I D E N T I A L BERLIN 002546SIPDISSIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 08/27/2021TAGS: PGOV GMSUBJECT: SPD IN DRIVER'S SEAT FOR BERLIN ELECTION Classified By: PolCouns John Bauman. Reason: 1.4(b) and (d)1. (U) Summary. With three weeks to go, opinion polls and political commentators and contacts all say Berlin's September 17 election of a new parliament is the SPD's to lose. The Social Democrats lead the Christian Democrats by over ten percent in all polls and the ratings gap between the two parties' candidates for Mayor is even greater. Real interest is already focusing on whom the SPD will chose as a coalition partner  the Left Party.PDS with which the SPD now governs the city, or the Green Party. The election, which is expected, in essence, to confirm Berlin's left of center majority, will have no immediate national political implications. However, Mayor Wowereit has signaled his interest in playing a role in national SPD politics in the future. Because of the predicted low turnout, concerns have been expressed by some observers that parties of the far-right will gain seats in some of Berlin's district assemblies. End Summary.The Campaign: SPD in Charge; CDU in Tatters--------------------------------------------2. (C) The state of Berlin leaves much to be desired  the weak school system has been the subject of a steady drumbeat of critical headlines for months; the business climate is at best stagnant and high-profile departures or attempted departures of big employers are an issue; the city's enormous debt continues to grow steadily and is now at 60 billion euros. Nonetheless, support for the SPD remains strong at 30-35 percent (ahead of the 29 percent taken in 2001) and Mayor Wowereit is genuinely popular. CDU xxxxx admits that the CDU's lead candidate, Friedbert Pflueger, simply cannot match Wowereit for charisma and campaign skills. Moreover, the Berlin CDU has been damaged by: 1) years of infighting and tension between modernizers in the party, including Pflueger, and old-school conservatives; and 2) the lingering effects of a banking scandal that drove it from office in 2001. Pflueger, from Lower Saxony, also suffers from a carpetbagger image  his last-minute announcement that he would give up his Bundestag membership and Defense Ministry State Secretaryship to concentrate on Berlin has not helped. The CDU has been hovering at around 20 percent in polls since even before the campaign began.3. (C) CDU and SPD contacts agree that the turnout for the election will likely be very low. SPD Berlin Business Manager Ruediger Scholz fears this could hurt the SPD more than the CDU and so the party intends to focus on getting its core supporters to the polls in the final weeks of the campaign. Scholz points out that a low turnout is likely to benefit smaller parties with more ideological voters  meaning the far-left WASG and the far-right NPD and Republicans. He and most other interlocutors seem to expect that the far-right will win seats in the district assemblies in at least some of Berlin's eastern districts while the WASG could win seats in Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain. The threshold for entry is winning only three percent of district votes. Neither far-right nor far-left is given any chance of clearing the five percent threshold for entry into the state parliament.Coalition Politics-----------------4. (C) The Left Party.PDS, according to Berlin leader Klaus Lederer, cannot expect a repeat of its 23 percent performance in 2001. That showing was the result of the banking scandal, which briefly tarred the SPD as well as CDU, and the star quality of then-PDS lead candidate Gregor Gysi, now fully occupied in the Bundestag. Polls put the LP.PDS at around 15 percent, which is where the Greens also stand. Thus, either party could be a plausible partner for the SPD. Mayor Wowereit has stated his desire to remain in government with the LP.PDS, though the two parties have not concluded a formal electoral alliance. The SPD's Scholz, Green Berlin caucus leader Sibyll Klotz, and Berlin FDP leader Markus Loening all agree that the LP.PDS would make the more comfortable partner for Wowereit because of the ease of their cooperation thus far and because keeping the LP.PDS in government defuses a large bloc of voters who could be mobilized easily to protest the cuts and privatizations which the government has used to try and recover control of the budget. However, Scholz notes that it would probably be better for the city and for Wowereit given his political ambitions, if he were to form a coalition with the Greens, who are more centrist (especially on finance) and, at the federal level, presentable. Green state parliament member Oezcan Mutlu argued strongly that Wowereit will opt for the Greens based on these considerations, though he acknowledged that working with the Greens would be harder. He even said that, given Green fractiousness, they would have to bring a 7-8 seat majority into a coalition to make it stable.5. (C) If the numbers did not work out for a two-party coalition (and all our contacts reject the idea of a Grand Coalition), then the most likely option seems to be an SPD-LP.PDS-Green alliance. However, some in the FDP (now at 8-9 percent in polls) hope that in such a situation, they might have a chance of sidling into power. Berlin FDP lead candidate Martin Lindner and Loening have told us that they believe the Greens would rather work with them than the LP.PDS. This seems quite a long shot, though, as Berlin Greens stand quite far to the left in the Green spectrum.Comment-------6. (C) The Berlin election is unlikely to have major national significance under any circumstances. The Grand Coalition recognizes this and, unlike in the period before the spring elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, is not postponing debate on contentious issues. However, in two aspects the elections are noteworthy. First, a victory will boost Klaus Wowereit's chance of playing a greater role in the SPD nationally, especially as he is seen as a standard-bearer for the party left. Second, even very localized success by the far-right will provoke comment and a measure of consternation and signal that the particular problem posed by far-rightist ideologues in eastern Germany remains to be resolved.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 MOSCOW 009533 SIPDIS SIPDIS E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/30/2016 TAGS: PGOV ECON PINR RSSUBJECT: A CAUCASUS WEDDING Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Daniel A. Russell. Reason 1.4 ( b, d) Summary ------- 1. (C) Weddings are elaborate in Dagestan, the largest autonomy in the North Caucasus. On August 22 we attended a wedding in Makhachkala, Dagestans capital: Duma member and Dagestan Oil Company chief Gadzhi Makhachevs son married a classmate. The lavish display and heavy drinking concealed the deadly serious North Caucasus politics of land, ethnicity, clan, and alliance. The guest list spanned the Caucasus power structure -- guest starring Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov -- and underlined just how personal the regions politics can be. End Summary. 2. (C) Dagestani weddings are serious business: a forum for showing respect, fealty and alliance among families; the bride and groom themselves are little more than showpieces. Weddings take place in discrete parts over three days. On the first day the grooms family and the brides family simultaneously hold separate receptions. During the receptions the groom leads a delegation to the brides reception and escorts her back to his own reception, at which point she formally becomes a member of the grooms family, forsaking her old family and clan. The next day, the grooms parents hold another reception, this time for the brides family and friends, who can inspect the family they have given their daughter to. On the third day, the brides family holds a reception for the grooms parents and family. Father of the Groom ------------------- 3. (C) On August 22, Gadzhi Makhachev married off his 19 year-old son Dalgat to Aida Sharipova. The wedding in Makhachkala, which we attended, was a microcosm of the social and political relations of the North Caucasus, beginning with Gadzhis own biography. Gadzhi started off as an Avar clan leader. Enver Kisriyev, the leading scholar of Dagestani society, told us that as Soviet power receded from Dagestan in the late 1980s, the complex society fell back to its pre-Russian structure. The basic structural unit is the monoethnic jamaat, in this usage best translated as canton or commune. The ethnic groups themselves are a Russian construct: faced with hundreds of jamaats, the 19th century Russian conquerors lumped cantons speaking related dialects together and called them Avar, Dargin, etc. to reduce the number of nationalities in Dagestan to 38. Ever since then, jamaats within each ethnic group have been competing with one another to lead the ethnic group. This competition is especially marked among the Avars, the largest nationality in Dagestan. 4. (C) As Russian power faded, each canton fielded a militia to defend its people both in the mountains and the capital Makhachkala. Gadzhi became the leader from his home canton of Burtunay, in Kazbek Rayon. He later asserted pan-Avar ambitions, founding the Imam Shamil Popular Front -- named after the great Avar leader of mountaineer resistance to the Russians -- to promote the interests of the Avars and of Burtunays role within the ethnic group. Among his exploits was a role in the military defense of Dagestan against the 1999 invasion from Chechnya by Shamil Basayev and al-Khattab, and his political defense of Avar villages under pressure in Chechnya, Georgia and Azerbaijan. 5. (C) Gadzhi has cashed in the social capital he made from nationalism, translating it into financial and political capital -- as head of Dagestans state oil company and as the single-mandate representative for Makhachkala in Russias State Duma. His dealings in the oil business -- including close cooperation with U.S. firms -- have left him well off enough to afford luxurious houses in Makhachkala, Kaspiysk, Moscow, Paris and San Diego; and a large collection of luxury automobiles, including the Rolls Royce Silver Phantom in which Dalgat fetched Aida from her parents reception. (Gadzhi gave us a lift in the Rolls once in Moscow, but the legroom was somewhat constricted by the presence of a Kalashnikov carbine at our feet. Gadzhi has survived numerous assassination attempts, as have most of the still-living leaders of Dagestan. In Dagestan he always travels in an armored BMW with one, sometimes two follow cars full of uniformed armed guards.) 6. (C) Gadzhi has gone beyond his Avar base, pursuing a multi-ethnic cadre policy to develop a network of loyalists. He has sent Dagestani youths, including his sons, to a military type high school near San Diego (we met one graduate, a Jewish boy from Derbent now studying at San Diego state. He has no plans to enter the Russian military). MOSCOW 00009533 002 OF 005 Gadzhis multi-ethnic reach illustrates what the editor of the Dagestani paper Chernovik told us: that in the last few years the development of inter-ethnic business clans has eroded traditional jamaat loyalties. 7. (C) But the Avar symbolism is still strong. Gadzhis brother, an artist from St. Petersburg, ordered as a wedding gift a life-sized statue of Imam Shamil. Shamil is the iconic national symbol, despite his stern and inflexible character (portrayed in Tolstoys Hadji-Murat as the mountaineers tyrannical counterpart to the absolutist Tsar). Connection with Shamil makes for nobility among Avars today. Gadzhi often mentions that he is a descendant on his mothers side of Gair-Bek, one of Shamils deputies. The Day Before -------------- 8. (C) Gadzhis Kaspiysk summer house is an enormous structure on the shore of the Caspian, essentially a huge circular reception room -- much like a large restaurant -- attached to a 40-meter high green airport tower on columns, accessible only by elevator, with a couple of bedrooms, a reception room, and a grotto whose glass floor was the roof of a huge fish tank. The heavily guarded compound also boasts a second house, outbuildings, a tennis court, and two piers out into the Caspian, one rigged with block and tackle for launching jet skis. The house filled up with visitors from all over the Caucasus during the afternoon of August 21. The Chair of Ingushetias parliament drove in with two colleagues; visitors from Moscow included politicians, businessmen and an Avar football coach. Many of the visitors grew up with Gadzhi in Khasavyurt, including an Ingush Olympic wrestler named Vakha who seemed to be perpetually tipsy. Another group of Gadzhis boyhood friends from Khasavyurt was led by a man who looked like Shamil Basayev on his day off -- flip-flops, t-shirt, baseball cap, beard -- but turned out to be the chief rabbi of Stavropol Kray. He told us he has 12,000 co-religionists in the province, 8,000 of them in its capital, Pyatigorsk. 70 percent are, like him, Persian-speaking Mountain Jews; the rest are a mixture of Europeans, Georgians and Bukharans. 9. (C) Also present was XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. He was reserved at the time, but in a follow-up conversation in Moscow on August 29 (please protect) he complained that Chechnya, lacking experts to develop programs for economic recovery, is simply demanding and disposing of cash from the central government. When we pressed him on disappearances, he admitted some took place, but claimed that often parents alleged their children had been abducted when in fact their sons had run off to join the fighters or -- in a case the week before -- they had murdered their daughter in an honor killing. We mentioned the abduction of a widow of Basayev, allegedly to gain access to his money. XXXXXX said he had not heard of the case, but knew that Basayev had had no interest in wealth; he may have been a religious fanatic, but he was a normal person. The fighters who remain are not a serious military force, in XXXXX view, and many would surrender under the proper terms and immunities. He himself is arranging the immunity of a senior official of the Maskhadov era, whose name he would not reveal. 10. (C) During lunch, Gadzhi took a congratulatory call from Dagestans president, Mukhu Aliyev. Gadzhi told Aliyev how honored he would be if Aliyev could drop in at the wedding reception. There was a degree of tension in the conversation, which was between two figures each implicitly claiming the mantle of leadership of the Avars. In the event, Aliyev snubbed Gadzhi and did not show up for the wedding, though the rest of Dagestans political leadership did. 11. (C) Though Gadzhis house was not the venue for the main wedding reception, he ensured that all his guests were constantly plied with food and drink. The cooks seemed to keep whole sheep and whole cows boiling in a cauldron somewhere day and night, dumping disjointed fragments of the carcass on the tables whenever someone entered the room. Gadzhis two chefs kept a wide variety of unusual dishes in circulation (in addition to the omnipresent boiled meat and fatty bouillon). The alcohol consumption before, during and after this Muslim wedding was stupendous. Amidst an alcohol shortage, Gadzhi had flown in from the Urals thousands of bottles of Beluga Export vodka (Best consumed with caviar). There was also entertainment, beginning even that day, with the big-name performers appearing both at the wedding hall and at Gadzhis summer house. Gadzhis main act, a Syrian-born singer named Avraam Russo, could not make it because he was shot a few days before the wedding, but there MOSCOW 00009533 003 OF 005 was a gypsy troupe from St. Petersburg, a couple of Azeri pop stars, and from Moscow, Benya the Accordion King with his family of singers. A host of local bands, singing in Avar and Dargin, rounded out the entertainment, which was constant and extremely amplified. 10. (C) The main activity of the day was eating and drinking -- starting from 4 p.m., about eight hours worth, all told -- punctuated, when all were laden with food and sodden with drink, with a bout of jet skiing in the Caspian. After dinner, though, the first band started an informal performance -- drums, accordion and clarinet playing the lezginka, the universal dance of the Caucasus. To the uninitiated Westerner, the music sounds like an undifferentiated wall of sound. This was a signal for dancing: one by one, each of the dramatically paunchy men (there were no women present) would enter the arena and exhibit his personal lezginka for the limit of his duration, usually 30 seconds to a minute. Each ethnic groups lezginka was different -- the Dagestani lezginka the most energetic, the Chechen the most aggressive and belligerent, and the Ingush smoother. Wedding Day 1 ------------- 11. (C) An hour before the wedding reception was set to begin the Marrakech reception hall was full of guests -- men taking the air outside and women already filling a number of the tables inside, older ones with headscarves chaperoning dozens of teenaged girls. A Dagestani parliamentarian explained that weddings are a principal venue for teenagers -- and more importantly their parents -- to get a look at one another with a view to future matches. Security was tight -- police presence on the ground plus police snipers positioned on the roof of an overlooking apartment block. Gadzhi even assigned one of his guards as our personal bodyguard inside the reception. The manager told Gadzhi there were seats for over a thousand guests at a time. At the height of the reception, it was standing room only. 12. (C) At precisely two p.m. the male guests started filing in. They varied from pols and oligarchs of all sorts -- the slick to the Jurassic; wizened brown peasants from Burtunay; and Dagestans sports and cultural celebrities XXXXXXX presided over a political table in the smaller of the two halls (the music was in the other) along with Vakha the drunken wrestler, the Ingush parliamentarians, a member of the Federation Council who is also a nanophysicist and has lectured in Silicon Valley, and Gadzhis cousin Ismail Alibekov, a submariner first rank naval captain now serving at the General Staff in Moscow. The Dagestani milieu appears to be one in which the highly educated and the gun-toting can mix easily -- often in the same person. 13. (C) After a couple of hours Dalgats convoy returned with Aida, horns honking. Dalgat and Aida got out of the Rolls and were serenaded into the hall, and into the Makhachev family, by a boys chorus lining both sides of the red carpet, dressed in costumes aping medieval Dagestani armor with little shields and swords. The couples entry was the signal for the emcee to roll into high gear, and after a few toasts the Piter gypsies began their performance. (The next day one of Gadzhis houseguests sneered, Some gypsies! The bandleader was certainly Jewish, and the rest of them were blonde. There was some truth to this, but at least the two dancing girls appeared to be Roma.) 14. (C) As the bands played, the marriageable girls came out to dance the lezginka in what looked like a slowly revolving conga line while the boys sat together at tables staring intently. The boys were all in white shirts and black slacks, while the girls wore a wide variety of multicolored but fashionable cocktail dresses. Every so often someone would shower the dancers with money -- there were some thousand ruble notes but the currency of choice was the U.S. hundred dollar bill. The floor was covered with them; young children would scoop the money up to distribute among the dancers. 15. (C) Gadzhi was locked into his role as host. He greeted every guest personally as they entered the hall -- failure to do so would cause great insult -- and later moved constantly from table to table drinking toasts with everyone. The 120 toasts he estimated he drank would have killed anyone, hardened drinker or not, but Gadzhi had his Afghan waiter Khan following him around to pour his drinks from a special vodka bottle containing water. Still, he was much the worse for wear by evenings end. At one point we caught up with him dancing with two scantily clad Russian women who looked far from home. One, it turned out was a Moscow poet (later she recited an incomprehensible poem in Gadzhis honor) who MOSCOW 00009533 004 OF 005 was in town with a film director to write the screenplay for a film immortalizing Gadzhis defense of Dagestan against Shamil Basayev. By 6 p.m. most of the houseguests had returned to Gadzhis seaside home for more swimming and more jet-skiing-under-the-influence. But by 8 the summer houses restaurant was full once more, the food and drink were flowing, the name performers were giving acoustic renditions of the songs they had sung at the reception, and some stupendously fat guests were displaying their lezginkas for the benefit of the two visiting Russian women, who had wandered over from the reception. The Wedding -- Day 2: Enter The Man ------------------------------------ 16. (C) The next days reception at the Marrakech was Gadzhis tribute to Aidas family, after which we all returned to a dinner at Gadzhis summer home. Most of the tables were set with the usual dishes plus whole roast sturgeons and sheep. But at 8:00 p.m. the compound was invaded by dozens of heavily armed mujahedin for the grand entrance of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, looking shorter and less muscular than in his photos, and with a somewhat cock-eyed expression on his face. After greetings from Gadzhi, Ramzan and about 20 of his retinue sat around the tables eating and listening to Benya the Accordion King. Gadzhi then announced a fireworks display in honor of the birthday of Ramzans late father, Ahmat-Hadji Kadyrov. The fireworks started with a bang that made both Gadzhi and Ramzan flinch. Gadzhi had from the beginning requested that none of his guests, most of whom carried sidearms, fire their weapons in celebration. Throughout the wedding they complied, not even joining in the magnificent fireworks display. 17. (C) After the fireworks, the musicians struck up the lezginka in the courtyard and a group of two girls and three boys -- one no more than six years old -- performed gymnastic versions of the dance. First Gadzhi joined them and then Ramzan, who danced clumsily with his gold-plated automatic stuck down in the back of his jeans (a houseguest later pointed out that the gold housing eliminated any practical use of the gun, but smirked that Ramzan probably couldnt fire it anyway). Both Gadzhi and Ramzan showered the dancing children with hundred dollar bills; the dancers probably picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones. Gadzhi told us later that Ramzan had brought the happy couple a five kilo lump of gold as his wedding present. After the dancing and a quick tour of the premises, Ramzan and his army drove off back to Chechnya. We asked why Ramzan did not spend the night in Makhachkala, and were told, Ramzan never spends the night anywhere. 18. (C) After Ramzan sped off, the dinner and drinking -- especially the latter -- continued. An Avar FSB colonel sitting next to us, dead drunk, was highly insulted that we would not allow him to add cognac to our wine. Its practically the same thing, he insisted, until a Russian FSB general sitting opposite told him to drop it. We were inclined to cut the Colonel some slack, though: he is head of the unit to combat terrorism in Dagestan, and Gadzhi told us that extremists have sooner or later assassinated everyone who has joined that unit. We were more worried when an Afghan war buddy of the Colonels, Rector of the Dagestan University Law School and too drunk to sit, let alone stand, pulled out his automatic and asked if we needed any protection. At this point Gadzhi and his people came over, propped the rector between their shoulders, and let us get out of range. Postscript: The Practical Uses of a Caucasus Wedding --------------------------------------------- -------- 19. (C) Kadyrovs attendance was a mark of respect and alliance, the result of Gadzhis careful cultivation -- dating back to personal friendship with Ramzans father. This is a necessary political tool in a region where difficulties can only be resolved by using personal relationships to reach ad hoc informal agreements. An example was readily to hand: on August 22 Chechnyas parliamentary speaker, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, gave an interview in which he made specific territorial claims to the Kizlyar, Khasavyurt and Novolak regions of Dagestan. The first two have significant Chechen-Akkin populations, and the last was part of Chechnya until the 1944 deportation, when Stalin forcibly resettled ethnic Laks (a Dagestani nationality) there. Gadzhi said he would have to answer Abdurakhmanov and work closely with Ramzan to reduce the tensions that fool had caused. Asked why he took such statements seriously, he told us that in the Caucasus all disputes revolve around land, and such claims can never be MOSCOW 00009533 005 OF 005 dismissed. Unresolved land claims are the threads the Russian center always kept in play to pull when needed. We asked why these claims are coming out now, and were told it was euphoria, pure and simple. After all they had received, the Chechen leaderships feet are miles off the ground. (A well-connected Chechen contact later told us he thought that raising nationalistic irredentism was part of Abdurakhmanovs effort to gain a political base independent from Kadyrov.) 20. (C) The horizontal of power represented by Gadzhis relationship with Ramzan is the antithesis of the Moscow-imposed vertical of power. Gadzhis business partner Khalik Gindiyev, head of Rosneft-Kaspoil, complained that Moscow should let local Caucasians rather than Russians -- Magomadovs and Aliyevs, not Ivanovs and Petrovs -- resolve the regions conflicts. The vertical of power, he said, is inapplicable to the Caucasus, a region that Moscow bureaucrats such as PolPred Kozak would never understand. The Caucasus needs to be given the scope to resolve its own problems. But this was not a plug for democracy. Gadzhi told us democracy would always fail in the Caucasus, where the conception of the state is as an extension of the Caucasus family, in which the fathers word is law. Where is the room for democracy in that? he asked. We paraphrased Hayek: if you run a family as you do a state, you destroy the family. Running a state as you do a family destroys the state: ties of kinship and friendship will always trump the rule of law. Gadzhis partner agreed, shaking his head sadly. Thats a matter for generations to come, he said. BURNS

(S) Summary.  On the evening of January 21, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) Al Nahyan hosted CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid for dinner.  They discussed regional security issues, but Iraq was clearly the focus of MbZ's interest.  MbZ expressed lack of confidence in being able to work with the Maliki government.  MbZ believes that the Saudis will not support any Sunni group in Iraq with Al-Qaeda ties, but that the Saudis are firm in their resolve to counter Iran.  MbZ reiterated UAE interest in acquiring Predator B.  Referring to the recent events in Somalia, MbZ commented: "The Somalia job was fantastic."  Also present were UAE Chief of Staff, Lt. General Hamad Mohammed Thani Al-Rumaithy; Director of Intelligence, Staff Brigadier General Engineer Essa Saif Mohammed Al-Mazrouei; Commander of the Special Operations, Major General Juma Ahmed Al-Bawardi Al-Falasi; and Commander of the UAE Air Forces and Air Defense, Staff Air Vice-Marshal (Major General) Mohammed Sowaidan Al-Gimzy.  End Summary.  Iraq ---- 2. (C) Clearly the focus for MbZ, discussion began with his pronouncement: "Let's talk about Iraq."  Gen. Abizaid noted that extremists on both ends of the Sunni/Shia spectrum are largely irretrievable, but we still have an opportunity to stabilize Iraq by reinforcing the moderate middle ground. MbZ said that he had little confidence in being able to work with this (Maliki's) government, saying of Maliki: "I think we are operating on different frequencies -- no, different radio systems altogether."  3. (S) MbZ asked General Abizaid what the U.S. hoped to achieve with the extra troops set to deploy to Iraq in 2007, and reiterated his concern about the level of ongoing violence against the Sunni.  Abizaid responded that the violence in Iraq is highly localized, principally in the Baghdad area, and that most of the rest of Iraq is quiet. The extra troops are intended to bring calm to Baghdad and give the government sufficient space and time to contain violence even further.  It will also send a message that the U.S. is not abandoning Iraq.  MbZ stated that Ahmad Chalabi and others had made a "big deal" out of the Baathist threat, but said that the Baathists were not and are not the problem -- even though specific individuals linked to the Ba,ath Party were/are the problem.  MbZ offered that de-Baathification was and is "an unnecessary distraction," stating that "pursuing a problem that doesn't really exist only leads to more problems."  He said he had seen Iyad Allawi a month ago -- noting that Allawi was looking to the UAE for support and assurances.  MbZ said that there is no assurance that the UAE can give him, adding: "It's not his time."  MbZ added that he believes that the Saudis will not assist Sunni groups in Iraq that are aligned with Al-Qaeda.  Iran ---- 4. (S) MbZ acknowledged that Tehran knows that the U.S. is serious in its stance against Iranian proliferation.  This can be clearly seen in "how Iran is changing its tactics." Abizaid pressed that countries in the region should make stronger statements.  Weak statements only encourage the Iranians: "We need our friends to say that they stand with the Americans."  MbZ avoided committing the UAE to anything like a public statement and shifted the discussion to other countries in the region saying: "The Saudis need no encouragement -- they are Wahhabis after all -- and will resolutely stand up to any Shi'a anywhere and counter them strongly."  Agreeing that it is only a matter of time before the Iranians develop or acquire advanced weapons technologies, including MTCR-controlled UAV technology, MbZ asserted:  "That's why we need it first . . . give me Predator B."  MbZ added: "Iran has to know that there is a price to pay for every decision they make.  They are expanding day by day -- they have to be dealt with before they do something tragic."  But that said, he continued: "We (UAE) are not ready yet" to confront Iran.  Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- 5. (S) Abizaid thanked MbZ for the actions of the UAE forces currently deployed in Afghanistan.  MbZ reciprocated: "No --  ABU DHABI 00000145  002 OF 002   thank you.  This has been a good chance for us, and we appreciate the opportunity."  MbZ questioned the role the Iranians were playing in Afghanistan.  He further observed that Musharraf is not doing enough to engage the tribes in the south, and needs to expand its efforts there.  Lebanon/Hizballah/Somalia -------------------------- 6. (S) Noting Lebanese PM Siniora's January 16 visit to the UAE, MbZ characterized Siniora as  good man.  We are supporting him."  MbZ said that Hizballah has made a "big mistake" in estimating its support in Lebanon, and has "played it wrong -- they do not have the support of the majority of the Lebanese people."  MbZ discussed with Abizaid the military technology that Hizballah used in 2006, specifically noting the amount of anti-tank weapons that Hizballah possessed.  Abizaid acknowledged that Hizballah has access to weapons technology that most Arab states don't have.  MbZ interrupted the conversation to state explicitly that he wants the U.S. to understand that the UAE was not involved in the transfer of those weapons or technologies in any way.  Referring to the recent events in Somalia, MbZ commented: "The Somalia job was fantastic."  7. (U) POLAD Ambassador Richard Roth has approved this message. SISON

ABU DHABI 97      B. ABU DHABI 145  Classified By: Michele Sison, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)  1. (S) Summary.  Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) Al Nahyan hosted Chief of Staff USAF General T. Michael Moseley on February 1, 2007.  MbZ warned Moseley of the growing threat from Iran, stating that they (Iran) "can't be allowed to have a nuclear program."  MbZ further emphasized that Iran's nuclear program must be stopped "by all means available."  As expected, MbZ inquired about Predator B. Moseley informed MbZ that the question of Predator B would require further discussion within the interagency and with our MTCR partners, while Ambassador noted that the USG looked forward to discussion of UAE defense requirements and our shared security objectives in the context of the Gulf Security Dialogue.  MbZ expressed a desire to have a missile defense system in place by Summer 2009, and was looking to add ship-based launch platforms as a part of that system.  He also noted that the UAE had identified a location on the northern border at an elevation of 6,000 feet that may be suitable for installation of an early warning radar system. End Summary.  Iran ---- 2. (S) Stating that "we are living in a dangerous neighborhood," MbZ stressed the importance of curtailing Iran's nuclear program to the overall stability of the Gulf, the Middle East as a region, and to the world's energy markets.  Pointing out that a nuclear weapon with even a short-range delivery system puts all the critical infrastructure in the Gulf at risk -- as well as the oil shipping lanes -- MbZ asserted: "If Iran can increase oil production to more than 15 million barrels of oil per day, let them have nuclear power, but until they can replace (the Gulf's) oil production they can't be allowed to have a nuclear program."  3. (S) MbZ told Moseley that the US should not focus too much on Ahmadinejad as the problem, but should focus instead on "the greater Iranian threat."  Calling Ahmadinejad  "merely the driver" of a bus (nuclear program) that has been running for a long time in Iran, MbZ described Iran's nuclear program as one that is no longer driven by personalities -- but which has become part of the Iranian identity.  Noting that even if Ahmadinejad or other leaders were to change, the nuclear program would still continue, MbZ stated: "Even a siege at this point will not change anything."   In answer to Moseley's question what should be done, MbZ responded: "Delay their program -- by all means available."  He added: "I am saying this knowing that I am putting my country at risk and placing myself in a dangerous spot."  4. (S) Speaking about his fears of Iran's growing hegemonic aspirations, MbZ warned the US not to underestimate the Iranians characterizing them as "extremely smart."  "It amazes me," MbZ continued, "that the Muslim Brotherhood, which controls Hamas, has at its core an opposition to all things Shi'a, and yet they (Hamas) cooperate with Iran.  That shows you how smart they are."  MbZ then pointed to what he called successful Iranian actions in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine to illustrate how Iran has managed to manipulate Muslim extremism in order to advance Shi'a and Iranian goals.  UAV/Predator B -------------- 5. (S) MbZ again asked about the status of the UAE request to acquire Predator B.  GeneralMoseley informed MbZ that the question of Predatr B acquisition would require further discussionwithin the interagency and with our MTCR partners.  MbZ nodded in understanding: "We are patient." He then added: "I hope the Iranians give us time; they are aggressive and are moving fast."  MbZ also mentioned that there were several other countries offering UAVs to the UAE.  Ambassador added that the U.S. and the other 33 MTCR members would be meeting in March to review the MTCR control list.  Growing demand worldwide for unmanned aerial vehicles had led to the need for a general discussion of how the MTCR controls UAVs and cruise missiles, and the USG looked forward to further discussion of UAE defense requirements and our shared security objectives in the context of the ongoing Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD).  Strategic Interests -------------------  ABU DHABI 00000187  002 OF 002   6. (S) Moseley's meeting with MbZ immediately followed a Raytheon/Lockheed Martin briefing of MbZ on the ongoing development of THAAD/PAC-3 and shared early warning systems. Speaking of a time frame for the first time, MbZ said he wants a complete missile defense system by summer 2009.  MbZ expressed particular interest in the possibility of mounting PAC-3 on Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).  Learning that PAC-3 cannot yet be mounted on a seagoing platform, MbZ was pleased to note that SLAMRAAM has already tested successfully on a wide variety of platforms and could be ship-based. Sheikh (Major) Ahmed bin Tahnoon A-Nahyan, advisor to MbZ on critical infrastructure protection, took particular note of this fact and asked about upgrading/extending their existing Hawk/AMRAAM assets.  When briefers noted the 32km limit of unelevated radar, MbZ stated that he has a location identified on the UAE's northern border at an elevation of 6000 feet that he would like contractors to come back and look at as a possible location for an early warning radar system.  Also present was International Affairs Advisor to the Crown Prince's Court Yousef Al-Otaiba, who is a UAE representative to the GSD.  7. (S) Comment: Although MbZ is increasingly talking tough on Iran, i.e., stop Iran "by all means possible" and "deal with Iran sooner rather than later" (ref A), his comments should also be taken in the context of strong UAE interest in acquiring advanced military technology and, specifically, MbZ's repeated requests for Predator B (ref B).  The UAEG is clearly nervous about any US actions that could upset their much larger and militarily superior neighbor. The UAE's significant trade relationship with Iran--approximately $4 billion--is another complicating factor in the relationship. On more than one occasion, the UAE leadership has expressed trepidation over the prospect of being caught in the middle between the US and Iran.  End Comment.  8.  (U) POLAD, Chief of Staff USAF, Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba has approved this message. SISON

ANKARA 1083 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: PolCouns Janice G. Weiner, reasons 1.4 (b), (d)1.(C) In contrast to rumors that Turkish FM Abdullah Gul is depressed after having had to withdraw his presidential bid, a journalist xxxxx described his demeanor as relaxed, confident and determined. xxxxx it was clear that both Gul and Hayrunissa had long lobbied for him to be the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) presidential candidate  and they still retain ambitions. xxxxx dismissed earlier press speculation that parliamentary speaker Bulent Arinc had forced the issue. It was instead Gul who went to Arinc to press his own case and ask for support. He reportedly told Arinc that he, Gul, did not want to see a bureaucrat (DefMin Gonul) in Cankaya.2. (C) The way Gul's candidacy ultimately played out was a reflection of the long-running partnership  and rivalry  between PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Gul, according to our contact. From the outset, the biggest hurdle was Erdogan who, until the last minute, proved unwilling to renounce his personal presidential ambitions. The PM waited so long that there was no time to cushion a Gul candidacy via the media, whose initial reactions to Gul's candidacy had been positive. The PM squandered an opportunity better to prepare both the military and the public. At that point, the opposition People's Republican Party (CHP) could have savored its anyone but Erdogan victory and Gul, who enjoyed good relations both with CHP and with the military, could have helped smooth the way. (Comment: It's not clear that a Gul candidacy would ever have been acceptable to the military, though they certainly do not like surprises. End comment.)3.(C) Once the Turkish General Staff released its e-memo late on April 27, it was allegedly Gul, not the PM, who persuaded AKP to take the democratic high road and hard line reflected in GOT spokesman Cemil Cicek's April 28 statement (ref A), which Gul reportedly penned. In the interview, Gul also reflected confidence in AKP's prospects for doing well in the upcoming general election.4.(C) One frequent TGS accusation has been that AKP has a hidden agenda. Gul had rebutted it consistently, pointing to the raft of political and economic reforms the AKP government has passed, and asking rhetorically if they would be working hard to harmonize Turkish law with EU law if GOT's agenda were sharia. xxxxx5.(C) According to xxxxx Gul was not a member of Milli Gorus, the old Necmettin Erbakan cabal of pious, anti-Semitic Anatolians who have little subtlety. Gul's initial political activity was with a serious student movement just prior to the 1980 coup (to which Erdogan also belonged), the Milli Turk Talebe Birligi (National Turkish Student Union - MTTB), a formerly leftist student group turned conservative/Islamist, then disbanded in 1980 as a result of the coup. After 1997, it was Gul's think-tank, Politik Arastirma Merkezi (Political Research Center - PAM) that planned AKP's split from Erbakan's Fazilet and mapped out the strategy that brought AKP to power in 2002. Gul is, per the journalist, the only one in the party whom Erdogan truly respects, in the Turkish sense of admiration, friendship and fear.6.(C) Comment: This picture of Gul is one person's view (who has known the Gul family for a long time), and stands in contrast to how others, including some in AKP, have described Gul. xxxxx for example, told us the FM was devastated and had never wanted to run. Whatever the truth about his mood, it is hard to believe that Gul, a seasonedAnkara 00001091 002 of 002politician and operator, would let himself be pushed into something he didn't want to do, even for the greater good for his party.

(S)  The Turkish military's April 27 memorandum that fueled the political crisis here was followed by a virtual black-out with the military refusing to speak with either domestic or foreign contacts.  The silence was broken recently when D/CHOD Saygun volunteered an explanation of the military's motives and current thinking.  We used the exchange to reiterate the need for pragmatism and compromise -- by all players -- in support of Turkish democracy and the constitutional process.  2.  (S)  In a recent meeting with DCM, Saygun raised the subject of Turkish domestic politics and said it was important we understand why the military felt compelled to make its April 27 statement.  He said the military spoke out solely to ensure the protection of Turkey's secular system. This is the principle responsibility of the Turkish military, which they are both obligated and determined to fulfill.  He asserted that Turkey's constitution empowered the military to protect the secular state -- that was what they had done and what they would continue to do.  3.  (S)  DCM responded by emphasizing the most precious quality of contemporary Turkey is that it is both secular and democratic -- and both must be preserved.  She noted the growing tensions and polarization throughout the country and urged that the military exercise caution and pragmatism. Avoiding confrontation and instability and ensuring that the political process proceeds in a way that is fully consistent with the constitution is in the best interest of Turkey and of all Turks regardless of their partisan affiliation.  4.  (S)  Saygun said that the military did not want confrontation and would not seek it out.  He claimed they easily could have sent tanks rolling in the streets if they had wanted to, but they did not.  He also argued that the military was far more concerned with stability -- political, economic, and social -- than the AKP which had made no effort to compromise.  5.  (S)  DCM underscored the importance of having the on-going parliamentary election proceed calmly and that all accept the results of the popular vote.  Saygun agreed enthusiastically and claimed the TGS had "no problems" with AKP in parliament or in government -- their only difficulty was with radical policies that threaten stability.  6.  (S)  Comment:  There is rampant speculation here about TGS' next move in the on-going political drama.  Overheated rumors include efforts to shut down the AKP, discredit the party leadership by releasing incriminating dossiers, and the manufacture of crises.  More prudent observers have suggested that a tacit -- if still tense -- understanding has been reached whereby the TGS has clarified its red lines on the presidency and Islamist policies and the AKP has agreed not to cross them.  Rumors notwithstanding, it is clear that maneuvering will intensify in the lead up to the July 22 elections, and USG support for democracy, compromise, and the constitutional process will remain critical.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001842  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2017 TAGS: PGOV PREL TUSUBJECT: TURKISH ELECTIONS: ANALYSTS ASSESS MILITARY CONFIDENCE IN ELECTION OUTCOME  Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b,d).  1. (C) Summary: Experts on civil-military relations in Ankara contend the Turkish General Staff (TGS) is satisfied with the process set in motion by its April 27 warning and the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision on the presidency vote which brought Turkey to early elections.  Analysts claim that the military and pro-secular opposition parties, buoyed by mass pro-secular demonstrations in May and June, believe that even if the AKP emerges from July 22 elections able to form a single-party government, it will be forced to accept a consensus candidate for the presidency.  Despite these claims of confidence, the military continues to work to exploit debate over a cross-border operation against PKK terrorists, as well as press allegations that the US is either directly or indirectly providing weapons to the PKK, to make the AKP government appear weak on security.  And of course there is the possibility of a last ditch attempt by the military -- via public statements, policy maneuvering, or partisan manipulation -- to sway undecided voters towards secular opposition parties.  Military reaction to the elections may be affected by the TGS's all-consuming annual exercise of the Supreme Military Council, which starts August 1.  End Summary  2. (C) The crisis atmosphere following the TGS's April 27 warning, which led many to fear some kind of military intervention, has been replaced by more traditional politicking in the final stretch to July 22 national elections.  After public sparring with the government in May and June over who would take responsibility for a cross-border operation against PKK terrorists in northern Iraq -- designed to show the AKP government as soft on terrorism -- the TGS has refrained from public statements on domestic political issues for the past two weeks.  Chief of Defense Gen Buyukanit and Deputy CHOD Saygun enjoyed scheduled vacations on the coast in late June and early July.  3. (C) According to Ankara University professor Tanel Demirel, the TGS achieved its primary short-term objective via the April 27 announcement: preventing Abdullah Gul from becoming president and ensuring a Constitutional Court ruling raising the vote threshold for president to 367.  The head of the secular and nationalist Ataturk Thought Association (ADD), retired General Sener Eruygur, pointed to the large turn-out at pro-secular rallies in Istanbul, Izmir and other cities as proof pro-secular forces are rising to challenge the AKP.  4. (C) Several observers, such as Bilkent University professor and military analyst Umit Cizre, identify the pivotal moment in the AKP's relations with the military as the private May 4 meeting between PM Erdogan and CHOD Buyukanit at the Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul.  Although Cizre and other analysts are not sure what happened during the 2.5 hour session, they conclude that Buyukanit and Erdogan reached some understanding.  Ankara University professor Nuran Yildiz believes Buyukanit made military "red lines" over the presidency clear to Erdogan at that encounter.  All agree that the situation relaxed considerably after that.  5. (C) Analysts' views vary widely on the significance of the military's April 27 internet warning that it was ready to intervene to protect Turkey's secular democracy.  Cizre and Demirel believe the April 27 statement was both harmful and unnecessary since the Constitutional Court was poised anyway to affirm a 367 quorum requirement for the presidency and thus defeat Gul's candidacy, precipitating early elections. Yildiz and others, including retired general Riza Kucukoglu at Ankara's Eurasian Studies Institute (ASAM), assert the military has played its role correctly in counterbalancing AKP attempts to monopolize all major power centers.  Even critics of the military's announcement, such as Ankara University professor Bedriye Poyraz, believe that the AKP provoked military intervention by blatant attempts to fill  ANKARA 00001842  002 OF 002   the government bureaucracy with its supporters and its ill-considered nomination of Gul for president.  They acknowledge that, despite criticism of the military's intervention by some intellectuals and pundits, most Turks see it as natural, if not appropriate, for the generals to make their political views known.  6. (C) Looking at post-election scenarios, most observers with whom we have spoken tell us the military can live with another AKP government, as long as the president is a secular figure selected by consensus.  The prospect of the AKP cooperating with independent Kurdish deputies in order to form a government is more controversial, as this would bring together the military and secular establishment's two archenemies: "Islamists and separatists."  While Cizre believes the generals could tolerate an alliance of AKP and Kurdish independents as long as the president is secular, ADD's Eruygur termed such an alliance a "nightmare" for Turkey.  ASAM's Kucukoglu asserted that the military would be uncomfortable with independent Kurdish MPs, citing their past behavior (in the early 1990s, the previous iteration of pro-Kurdish MPs attempted to take the parliamentary oath in Turkish and made statements that triggered the lifting of their parliamentary immunity and eventual prosecution).  He claimed, however, that military coups are no longer necessary, now that the majority of Turks who favor secularism have found their voice.  7. (C) Comment: Despite analysts' claims of military confidence, the generals are clearly working behind the scenes, using ongoing PKK terrorism and the debate over the necessity of a cross-border operation into northern Iraq to portray the AKP as weak on terrorism.  We also detect the military's hand behind recent allegations that the U.S. has, either directly or indirectly, provided weapons to the PKK in northern Iraq.   This is also designed to weaken AKP's national security credentials and encourage undecided voters to turn to "tougher" pro-secular parties.  While the military could roil the waters and make a public statement on the elections at any time, its post-election reaction may be delayed by the August 1 start of annual, and all-consuming, Supreme Military Council (YAS) promotions and assignments deliberations.

(S) SUMMARY AND COMMENT. Prime Minister Erdogan, chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), is a perfectionist workaholic who sincerely cares for the well-being of those around him, according to a top-level Prime Ministry insider. His boss is very democratic, he said, but the overall description sounds more like a benevolent patriarch who runs his domain according to strict autocratic rules. While this is only one man's impressions, they come from someone whose daily exposure to the PM lends credibility and color to his comments. END SUMMARY AND comment.2. (S) xxxxx provided a glimpse of PM Erdogan's personal style. Erdogan demands perfection from himself and from those around him; he finds a way for even perfect things to be improved. At the Central Decision-making and Executive Board meeting after the July 22 election (in which AKP soared above even its high expectations to win 46.6 percent of the vote), members expected Erdogan to praise the results. Instead, he laid out the party's next goal of gaining a foothold in the very few places left in Turkey without AKP representation: Only one and a half years until local elections. For AKP to be the party of Turkey, we need to get Izmir, Trabzon, Tunceli, and (presidential palace) Cankaya.3.

Erdogan is on vacation now for three days, which for him is a long time.

(S) If you know the Prime Minister well, then you know he is very stubborn, our contact told us. Once he sets his mind to something, or more importantly, once he believes in something, there is no dissuading him. He is a very determined individual. He is also very skilled and influential in direct personal relationships, which he works to cultivate with foreign leaders.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 000648  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2017 TAGS: PGOV PREL ECON TUSUBJECT: THE TRUTH BEHIND THE AKP'S "SECRET ISLAMIC AGENDA"  REF: A. ANKARA 0629      B. ANKARA 0610  Classified By: Political Counselor Janice G. Weiner for reasons 1.4(b),  (d)  1. (C) Summary.  Ever since its victory in the 2002 general elections, rumours and suspicion have swirled around the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) "secret" Islamist agenda.  After more than four years in power, some doubters are relieved to find an AKP that appears conservative, Western- as well as Islam-oriented, reform minded and democratic.  Others remain convinced that AKP is determined to impose Sharia law in Turkey and undermine the country's secular system once it gains control of the triple crown - the presidency, prime ministry and parliament - in this year's double elections.  The evidence either way is circumstantial, but the issue is central to Turkey's future. Turkey's traditional secularists (including the civil service, judiciary and military), opposition parties and even ultra and neo-nationalists are resorting to increasingly desperate maneuvers, including rumour and innuendo, to counter the perceived "threat" of an AKP-dominated triumverate.  Their concern is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that AKP's reform agenda threatens the established elite's traditional, top-down control.  To keep the public's trust and minimize tension as Turkish society evolves, AKP leaders will need to continue to employ broad-reaching, moderate, balanced rhetoric.  End summary.  The Origins of Suspicion ------------------------ 2. (SBU)  Those looking to brand the AKP as Islamists determined to undermine the Turkish Republic point first to the AKP's religious origins and PM Erdogan's political roots.  AKP evolved from Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP), an Islamist party founded in 1993.  Critics focus on Erdogan, who in 1994 as Istanbul's mayor, called himself the "imam of Istanbul" and praised God that he was a servant of Sharia. Later, in 1998, Erdogan served four months of a 10-month sentence for inciting religious hatred by reading a religious poem at a rally.  When the Constitutional Court outlawed the RP in 1998, Erdogan and other RP members formed the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party (FP).  When FP was banned in 2001 for unconstitutional anti-secular activities, Erdogan split off from Erbakan and formed AKP with more pragmatic members willing to work within the existing political system.  Erbakan and more hardcore Islamists formed Saadet (Felicity) Party.  Erdogan moderated his rhetoric, making it easier for voters to turn to AKP in the 2002 elections as an alternative to traditional parties, mired in scandals, corruption and an economic crisis.  AKP surged to power with 34 percent of the vote, one of the largest parliamentary majorities in Turkey's history.  For the Defense --------------- 3. (C)  Those who view AKP as reform-minded and democratic are quick to cite AKP-backed reforms that strengthened freedoms and democracy.  AKP legislation that reduced the military's influence in the National Secuity Council (MGK) and eliminated military membership in the security courts and the Board of Higher Education (YOK), among others, improved the civil-military equilibrium that had been heavily skewed toward military control.  They cite as evidence of the party's western-oriented, free market approach AKP's liberal economic policies, which have stimulated the private sector, increased foreign investment, reduced inflation and stabilized the currency.  AKP supporters argue that Turkey's traditional power centers (the military, judiciary, bureacracy) feel threatened by EU-linked human rights and rule of law reforms that enhance individual freedoms.  By promoting EU membership, the AKP is slowly introducing more balance into Turkey's strictly secular, statist society. Supporters maintain that Erdogan's appointment of AKP loyalists to influential positions previously held by secularists has generated resentment against the AKP, further fueled by the party's popularity.  They frame attacks against the party as desperate measures by entrenched secularists who fear that further democratization will undermine their traditional control and the economic benefits they derived from state intervention in the economy.  4. (C)  Opponents charge that AKP only pushed a reform agenda  ANKARA 00000648  002 OF 004   as far as necessary to convince the EU to begin accession talks.  Even then, AKP focused on those reforms needed to dilute the military's power rather than those that might interfere with the party's Islamic agenda.  They note Erdogan's support for greater freedom to express Islamic practices (such as wearing the headscarf), and point to his failure to allow Alevis, Kurds, Armenian and Greek Orthodox communities similar freedoms.  Suspicious that the accession process is just a cover for the AKP's anti-secular Islamic agenda, some in the military and opposition are reconsidering the merits of EU membership.  AKP officials admit reform efforts have slowed, but explain that Turkey's bureaucracy needs time to absorb and implement significant changes, such as the complete overhaul of the Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Punishments Law passed between 2002 and 2004.  They also note that parliament passed in November 2006 much of another major reform package, including legislation relating to minority foundations and schools, military audits, military courts and political party funding.  In some cases, parliament has had to re-approve the legislation to overcome President Sezer's veto.  Circumstantial Evidence ----------------------- 5. (C)  Conspiracy theorists and concerned secularists alike build the case against AKP using persuasive but largely circumstantial evidence.  Many claim that Erdogan has used AKP's parliamentary majority to weaken Turkey's secular educational, financial and judicial institutions.  They warn that an AKP troika of president, PM and parliament speaker would control the appointments process, transforming Turkey's secular system into something approaching an Islamic republic.  They point to AKP-sponsored changes in the strictly secular education system to allow graduates of religious high schools (imam hatip) to compete for limited university seats and qualify for government jobs. Previously, imam hatip, like other vocational school graduates, advanced to the clergy or other appropriate professions.  In addition, opponents charge that AKP has undermined state regulation of private Koranic schools by lifting age limits and extending hours of attendance.  As a result, the number of Koranic schools has increased significantly, with correspondingly less government oversight.  6. (C) Erdogan is also frequently accused of trying to infiltrate the higher education system with Islamist-minded professors and administrators.  After some university rectors resisted AKP efforts to introduce more Islam into the curriculum, AKP opponents claimed the government began a harrassment campaign.  Police arrested one obstinate rector in Van twice in 2006; both times he was reinstated by court decision.  Legislation creating 15 new universities gave the government authority to appoint the new rectors, rather than the usual procedure of approvals by YOK and the president. The law, pushed through over President Sezer's veto, is viewed as an end-run to allow Erdogan to select 15 new rectors of his mindset.  Parliament currently is considering a proposal to establish another 17 new universities.  Green Money Seeping In ---------------------- 7. (C)  While many acknowledge AKP economic successes, some doubters flag the alleged influx of "green" money from Islamic sources as proof of the real direction AKP is taking Turkey's economy.  AKP opponents note that Islamist capital is hard to track and question whether it is ultimately tied to more Islamist policies.  Increased investments from the UAE and a promised doubling of trade with Saudi Arabia after the Saudi King's unprecedented 2006 visit raised suspicions among some western-oriented investors.  The overall trend of increased foreign investor inflows actually counters insinuations of an Islamist take-over of Turkey's financial sector, however.  Investments from Islamic sources pale in comparison to total foreign inflows and do not seem to be of economic or political significance.  8. (C) Erdogan reputedly has manipulated the political appointments process to place Islamist bankers in key economic positions.  Along with Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan - a former board member of one of Turkey's leading Islamic banks (al-Baraka) - Erdogan's appointment of seven other al-Baraka officials to key positions in Turkey's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund is cited as support for an  ANKARA 00000648  003 OF 004   Islamist take-over theory.  In 2006, the PM virtually paralyzed financial policy when he tried to appoint an Islamist as head of the Central Bank against President Sezer's firm opposition.  (The compromise candidate has demonstrated independent decision-making since his appointment.)  To round out the "damning" evidence, critics cite FM Gul's background as a specialist at the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah from 1983 to 1991 and his reported objections to state scrutiny of Islamic enterprises.  Packing the Court ------------------ 9. (C) Erdogan is also accused of staging a take-over of the judiciary.  The AKP pushed through legislation to lower the mandatory retirement age for technocrats, opening the way for Erdogan to name almost 4,000 of 9,000 judges and prosecutors.  In a stand-off with the judiciary, AKP has threatened to refuse to implement high court rulings against the government for obstructing AKP-sponsored legislation.  Similar struggles between AKP and President Sezer have caused Sezer to veto over 3,000 AKP appointments and send over 100 AKP-backed laws to the Constitutional Court for review.  But for Sezer, Erdogan would already be implementing his "secret" agenda, worried secularists claim.  Economic reformers, including the IMF, for their part, would be only too happy to see an AKP-inspired change in the judiciary, which has consistently blocked forward-looking economic reforms.  10. (C) Erdogan rebutted the secularists' charges in 2006 by noting that the AKP hadn't been in power long enough to reshape the judiciary.  Rigid bureaucratic controls on promotions and a 15-20 year career path for judges limit the influence of any particular government on the judiciary's orientation.  But critics note that Justice Ministry budgetary control over the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which oversees assignments within the judiciary, gives the AKP indirect influence that can have a long-term impact.  The president appoints five of the seven council members.  The Justice Minister, however, heads the council and controls its funding, which could discourage council members from voting against the Minister's proposed appointees.  The most recent charge is that the Minister, by not attending Supreme Council sessions, is preventing 29 judicial positions from being filled.  Small Changes -------------- 11. (C) AKP's strategy to infiltrate its Islamist agenda into Turkey's secular institutions extends to the municipal level and beyond, according to AKP opponents.  The party controls four of Turkey's five largest cities (Ankara, Istanbul, Bursa and Konya).  Measures by some AKP mayors to ban alcohol on municipal property, establish women-only parks or equip ferries with prayer rooms are seen as Islamic encroachments on the secular system.  Erdogan and other party leaders explained the alcohol restrictions as consistent with the state's obligation to protect children from alcohol, drugs and gambling, rather than a religious proscription. Municipalities are authorized to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol on municipal property and near schools, religious sites and related locations.  Of the 62 provincial capitals that have such a ban, 18 have non-AKP mayors.  Of the 19 without alcohol bans, 14 have AKP mayors.  As another often-cited example of small but telling changes, critics note that employees at the Health Ministry and state-owned Turkish Airlines reported being questioned about their religious beliefs and attitudes toward the Koran, an unprecedented practice.  Internal Balancing Act ---------------------- 12. (C) Erdogan has performed a delicate balancing act to maintain unity within the AKP, despite the sometimes conflicting interests of its competing factions.  Many party faithful are pious; keeping their allegiance is central to the AKP's hold on power but Erdogan has won them few tangible successes.  He has not upheld earlier pledges to lift the ban on headscarves in public buildings, though his strong objections when the European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban in public schools resonated with the party's more devout members.  AKP's more conservation faction was disappointed by the failed attempt to criminalize adultery in 2004. Erdogan's attempts to put loyalists into government jobs can also be viewed through the prism of rewarding the party  ANKARA 00000648  004 OF 004   faithful.  The Jury Is Out --------------- 12. (C)  Comment. To date, AKP critics can only muster circumstantial evidence of an AKP Islamist agenda. Opposition leaders, some media outlets, the military and extreme nationalists have used this to play up fears that an AKP triumvirate will allow Erdogan to make significant, perhaps irreversible, changes that would undermine Turkey's secular system.  Using dramatic ad campaigns and threatening rhetoric, they warn that Turkey may soon have an Islamist president with a head-scarf wearing wife ready to take the country back to the pre-republic "dark ages".  President Sezer, military leaders and the MGK chief have all warned Erdogan against unconstitutional moves that might change Turkey's secular identity.  The secular establishment's concern that AKP poses a genuine threat to Turkey's secular system is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that AKP's reform agenda threatens the established elite's traditional, top-down control.  13. (C)  Those not convinced of a nefarious AKP plan contend that more than four years in power have matured the party. Erdogan has had to moderate his message to balance factions within AKP and lessen tensions with secularists threatened by AKP reforms.  Much of the party's success stems from its image as being less corrupt ("AK" in Turkish means "clean", a dubious claim for any party here) and more effective than the opposition.  Its record to date describes a center-right, conservative party with Islamic roots that has modestly advanced Kemal Ataturk's core principles of westernization and modernization.  Some of the changes tied to that process will inevitably transform the traditional power balance and strengthen civilian leaders.  To keep the public's trust and minimize tension as Turkish society evolves, AKP, and Erdogan in particular, will need to continue to employ broad-reaching, moderate, balanced rhetoric.  End Comment.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BAGHDAD 003895  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  LONDON PLEASE PASS TO GAYLE  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/2027 TAGS: PGOV PREL PTER IR IQSUBJECT: UK AMBASSADOR TO IRAN ON IRI NEGOTIATING STYLE, TACTICS  BAGHDAD 00003895  001.3 OF 003   Classified By: by CDA Patricia Butenis for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.(C) UK Ambassador to Tehran Geoffrey Adams, in a series of meetings with U.S. Embassy Baghdad and MNF-I officials, outlined his recommendations on how to negotiate with Iranians.  Ambassador Adams thought that Iran had several goals from talks with the U.S., both superficial and substantive.  In negotiations, he advised being steady and firm, tough but not aggressive, and at the same time, seeking to engage and draw attention to mutual interests.  He outlined Iran,s preconceptions and its obsession with and mistrust of  the West, which, he said, can blind it to its interests.  He warned that the Iranian participants would likely have very strict instructions what they could say and that it would be difficult to get them off script, though the element of surprise could work.  Adams added that the Iranians would be very nervous of negative repercussions if they made a misstep, and they would likely report on each other.  Answers to questions and proposals would more likely only come at follow-on meetings, and decision-making in Iran is slowed by the need for consensus, so patience is needed. That said, it was important to rid the Iranians of their standard notion that time was on their side.  End summary  2.(C) British Ambassador to Iran Geoffrey Adams offered advice in negotiating strategies with Iran in a series of meetings with U.S. officials and military officers in Baghdad November 24-25.   The following is an amalgamation of three meetings, held in advance of the fourth round of Iran-Iraq-U.S. trilateral discussions on Iraq.  Adams, who has served in Tehran for almost two years, said his observations were borne of much experience, to include a  class8 when Iran captured at gunpoint 15 British Navy personnel in March 2007.  British Ambassador to Kuwait Stuart Laing also joined the discussions, as well as British First Secretary in Tehran Alex Pinfield.  Among those present on the U.S. side at various briefings were Ambassador Crocker, MNF-I Commanding General Petraeus, Pol-Mil Minister Counselor Ambassador Marcie Ries, MG Kevin Bergner, Special Advisor David Pearce, and IRPO Director Jillian Burns.  The British ambassador,s views of Iran,s strategic interests and the internal political situation to be reported septel.  3.(C) Iranians, goal, in Adams, view, is to institutionalize talks with the U.S. and keep open the possibility of broadening the agenda.  While he heard that the Iranians were disappointed in the  of substance8 in previous bilateral talks with the U.S, they felt they derived good publicity from participating.  Adams predicted the Iranians will seek to keep them going both to engender their prestige and to keep tabs on what the USG is thinking. He also thought the talks had triggered a useful internal debate in how to make the best use of the talks and their strategic interests.  Adams added that he believed there is a significant lobby in Iran against holding talks with the U.S.   Assumptions ---------------  4.(C) In talks with Iranians, Ambassador Adams recommended being steady and firm, tough but not aggressive, and at the same time, seeking to engage.   He stressed that Iranians are obsessed with the West and this obsession at times blinds them to their interests.  In this light, the US side should be aware of the following preconceptions on the Iranian side:  -- the USG seeks to remove the current regime and replace it with a pro-Western one.  -- USG policymakers spend an inordinate amount of time and energy thinking about (and plotting against) Iran.  As such, Iranians assume that everything we do or say has meaning and has been carefully thought out and coordinated, both internally and with the UK; there are no accidents.  -- The current U.S. administration is politically very weak, facing major internal opposition, and as such, the threat of US military action against Iran is not realistic.  -- Iran sees the U.S. as a tough, determined adversary that can be manipulated and wounded.  Mistrust ----------   BAGHDAD 00003895  002.4 OF 003   5.(C) The legacy of the Iran-Iraq war, when the international community was either silent or sided with Saddam (even when he used WMD against Iranians) must be kept in mind.  Iranians mistrust the outside world, to include the very same Western powers and Sunni Arab states that are now seeking to ensure that pro-Iranian Shias do not dominate  power in Iraq.  Short Leash --------------  6.(C) Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) government negotiators arrive with precise and detailed instructions from which they do not deviate, out of fear of professional repercussions. They will go through all their talking points.  The USG should not expect substantive responses to questions or initiatives in real time.  This problem can be obviated to an extent by scheduling  of breaks,8 allowing IRIG officials time to confer amongst themselves and to seek guidance via telephone from Tehran.  However, given the fear of a misstep on the IRI side, the USG should not expect real engagement from the IRI outside of their instructions. Answers to questions and responses to suggestions are likely to come at follow-on meetings, although some questions never get answered.  Preparation --------------  7.(C) IRIG officials will likely prepare in detail for the talks.  They may consult with Iranians with extensive experience with Americans, such as academics who have participated in Track Two talks or worked in the U.S.  He also mentioned that the head of Iran,s Chamber of Commerce Mohammad Nahavandian is also perceived as a U.S. expert and is likely consulted.  Adams doubted that Iran would seek advice in negotiating with Americans from other countries. Adams repeatedly said,  are not stupid,8 meaning they follow all the issues closely, even if they at times misread the signals.  Slow Process ----------------  8.(C) In light of the short leash negotiators have, plus the collaborative and multi-polar nature of IRI decision-making and the extreme sensitivity of the topic of direct USG-IRIG talks, the USG should not expect immediate  steps.8 Any progress will be slow and come only after much deliberation and discussion in Iran, with push-back from those circles opposing talks.  If the IRIG concludes that a policy shift is in their interests, it can do it and find a way to justify it, but will first have to achieve internal consensus.  Stay Calm ------------  9.(C) It is important with the Iranians not to lose one,s temper or show that one is upset.  Trading accusations allows the IRIG to rely on a familiar script; far better is to ask unexpected questions that will take them  When asked how to best broach continued IRIG support of JAM splinter groups despite IRIG assurances to the Government of Iraq to stop the flow of weapons, Adams recommended keeping the tone  matter-of-fact and raising issues in question form, i.e.  your assurances that you are seeking to help Iraqi forces re-establish peace and security, how can we explain the ongoing training of JAM-related illegal combatants in Iran?8  Agenda ---------  10.(C) Don,t offer an agenda beforehand, otherwise the agenda itself will become subject to ongoing negotiations.  Establish Mutual Interests -------------------------------  11.(C) Seek to show a commonality or intersection of national interests that will justify Iran taking actions suggested by the USG.  Prove to them that  we fail in Iraq, they fail too.8  Draw them out on their contradictory tactics in order to spark debate within the IRIG.  Assess what the Iranians want out of the talks, beyond their publicly stated position of wanting a timetable for a withdrawal of foreign troops.  BAGHDAD 00003895  003 OF 003    Clock Ticking -----------------  12.(C) IRIG interlocutors assume that time is on their side and hence default towards inaction.  Convince them that now is the time to act, and that not doing so will hurt their interests and that the situation could get worse.  In a related vein, the IRI must be convinced that the USG is prepared to stop dialogue (although not necessarily close the channel) if there is no progress.  At the same time, realize internally that the negotiators cannot take a bold move without consultation, a reasonable degree of patience is required, and progress may take time.  Put the Ball in Their Court --------------------------------  13.(C) Ask a lot of questions, always put the ball back in their court.  Doing so will encourage internal discussion and debate in Tehran, as well as put pressure on them to deviate from their prepared script.  Wrong foot them by saying something unexpected to try to take them off script.  Focus on accountability, asking for clarifications of actions that contradict their stated commitments.  Keep your message clear, including redlines, and do not be too subtle.  Weaknesses --------------  14.(C) Despite their rhetoric, Iranians understand their weaknesses include a lack of allies and foreign investment.  Publicity ----------  15.(C) Iran is very sensitive to press coverage that makes them look weak.  At the same time, the IRIG has a  threshold for embarrassment8 when they are accused of illicit activities.  After the talks, the IRIG will seek to present the exchange as ,8 with the US and Iran on equal footing, where the IRIG  nothing away.8 BUTENIS

BERLIN 230       B. BERLIN 200  Classified By: DCM John M. Koenig for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S/NF) In a February 6 discussion with German Deputy National Security Adviser Rolf Nikel, the DCM reiterated our strong concerns about the possible issuance of international arrest warrants in the al-Masri case.  The DCM noted that the reports in the German media of the discussion on the issue between the Secretary and FM Steinmeier in Washington were not accurate, in that the media reports suggest the USG was not troubled by developments in the al-Masri case.  The DCM emphasized that this was not the case and that issuance of international arrest warrants would have a negative impact on our bilateral relationship.  He reminded Nikel of the repercussions to U.S.-Italian bilateral relations in the wake of a similar move by Italian authorities last year.  2.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German Government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.  We of course recognized the independence of the German judiciary, but noted that a decision to issue international arrest warrants or extradition requests would require the concurrence of the German Federal Government, specifically the MFA and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ).  The DCM said our initial indications had been that the German federal authorities would not allow the warrants to be issued, but that subsequent contacts led us to believe this was not the case.  3.  (S/NF) Nikel also underscored the independence of the German judiciary, but confirmed that the MFA and MOJ would have a procedural role to play.  He said the case was subject to political, as well as judicial, scrutiny.  From a judicial standpoint, the facts are clear, and the Munich prosecutor has acted correctly.  Politically speaking, said Nikel, Germany would have to examine the implications for relations with the U.S.  At the same time, he noted our political differences about how the global war on terrorism should be waged, for example on the appropriateness of the Guantanamo facility and the alleged use of renditions.  4.  (S/NF) Nikel also cited intense pressure from the Bundestag and the German media.  The German federal Government must consider the "entire political context," said Nikel.  He assured the DCM that the Chancellery is well aware of the bilateral political implications of the case, but added that this case "will not be easy."  The Chancellery would nonetheless try to be as constructive as possible.  5.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that the USG would likewise have a difficult time in managing domestic political implications if international arrest warrants are issued.  He reiterated our concerns and expressed the hope that the Chancellery would keep us informed of further developments in the case, so as to avoid surprises.  Nikel undertook to do so, but reiterated that he could not, at this point "promise that everything will turn out well." TIMKEN JR
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BERLIN 000802  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2022 TAGS: PREL PGOV ECUN EU GMSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR ANGELA MERKEL IN WASHINGTON: GOALS FOR EUROPE, GOALS AT HOME  REF: BERLIN 747  Classified By: DCM John Koenig.  Reason: 1.4(b) and (d)  1. (C) Summary.  Angela Merkel arrives in Washington in an enviable position of political strength, both at home and in the EU.  However, she is conscious that her strength derives largely from the weakness of her counterparts and other factors beyond her control.  Achieving her goals for the EU - in the trans-Atlantic context these are focused on climate change and the Transatlantic Economic Initiative - will reinforce her position at home and in the EU, and serve as a springboard to success on the larger G-8 stage.  A success for Merkel is also a success for the U.S.  Even after the German EU Presidency, we will want the Atlanticist Merkel to remain a dominant force within the EU.  In Berlin, a successful summit will strengthen her and other trans-Atlanticists against those who favor a policy of vocal, public antagonism.  End Summary.  Leading in the EU; Muddling Through at Home -------------------------------------------  2. (C) Angela Merkel's role as Germany's and Europe's leader is undisputed.  No other leader of a large member state is politically fit enough to offer himself up as a leader.  Her leadership of the G-8 and Germany's intrinsic weight and economic recovery are further boosts.  At home, Merkel is not only riding high in opinion polls (70 percent popularity rating) and enjoying the benefits of leadership at a time of long-sought economic growth, but has also wrong-footed her coalition partner Social Democrats with reformist domestic social policies.  However, in both cases her apparent strength is not entirely of her own making, but derives in large part from her office, the weakness of her counterparts, or from other factors beyond her control.  She took the helm of the EU at a time when progress on the European project had largely come to a halt, when European institutions were unsure of how or in which direction to move, and (as noted) no alternative leaders were present. In Berlin, her coalition partner and rival, the Social Democrats (SPD), are dealing with weak leadership, a vacuum of ideas, and a challenge from the left.  3. (C) Merkel has responded to these similar circumstances with quite different tactics.  In the EU, she has asserted German and her personal leadership over the Council Secretariat, especially with respect to her goal of  SIPDIS developing a road map for furthering the EU constitution. She has sidelined Brussels by putting her own representatives on the road to discuss the constitution in other capitals and has weighed in personally as needed to find compromises that keep the constitutional project moving forward.  Likewise, she has vigorously pursued the Transatlantic Economic Initiative within the EU to remove regulatory barriers, and has pushed for agreement on the new EU climate change and energy initiatives.  She has not succeeded in all her undertakings -- prospects for a new EU Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia remain distant, for example.  Still, the view that we hear from Brussels is of vigorous and effective leadership.  In Berlin, Merkel is known for her reticence to engage in aggressive politics, preferring to stay in the background until the "correlation of forces" is clear and then engaging to nudge the debate in her preferred direction.  Though the SPD is weak, Merkel has been reluctant to push it hard.  Her strategy appears to be aimed at building and consolidating her own and her party's dominance with a view toward a clear victory in 2009 elections, rather than attempting to score victories now that could alienate significant voter groups.  Washington: What's In It for Merkel -----------------------------------  4. (C) We sum up Merkel's goal for the U.S.-EU Summit as being to achieve substantive progress in the U.S.-EU relationship for its own sake and to build a lasting foundation for her leadership in the EU and in Germany.  The substantive agenda is clear and we need not explore it in detail here.  It is focused on our political cooperation in key areas - climate change and energy security as well as the Transatlantic Economic Initiative.  We recognize that in these and other areas, European goals are not exactly aligned with our own.  Nonetheless, success in these areas, the former a key concern of European publics and the latter important to sustaining European growth, after a long period in which trans-Atlantic relations were dominated by negative headlines and exchanges focused on other regions, would prove Merkel's particular competence at succeeding in Europe's key external relationship.  After success in Washington, Merkel  BERLIN 00000802  002 OF 002   can count on maintaining her position in Europe against any incoming French President and UK Prime Minister-in-waiting Brown.  Success in Washington will also strengthen her hand in the follow-on summits with Russia, Canada, and Japan and sets the stage for success in G-8 summit deliberations on climate change.  5. (C) At home, a Summit success may enable Merkel to end the SPD's ability to use loud, public "principled" criticism of the U.S. as a winning tactic.  Gerhard Schroeder won the 2002 election with his public attacks on U.S. Iraq policy, but if Merkel brings home meaningful agreements -- especially on issues with domestic resonance such as climate change and trans-Atlantic economic cooperation -- she will have shown the German public that her policy of constructive engagement with the U.S. brings real benefits on issues of concern to it.  Foreign policy, especially trans-Atlantic relations, is one of the few areas where the SPD still enjoys greater public support than does the CDU/CSU.  Success in Washington may undercut the SPD on that theme, as the CDU/CSU has already undercut it on many domestic social themes.  A Note on Style ---------------  6. (C) Merkel is pushing for a Summit that is more than a predictable set-piece, quickly forgotten.  She looks for real decisions to be made during the Summit discussions.  This does more than just ensure that she has something important to do.  It emphasizes her personal commitment to restoring European-American relations and her belief in face-to-face engagement.  We recognize the difficulty of organizing discussions in this format, but believe we too stand to gain by such an approach.  What's In This for Washington -----------------------------  7. (C) Post has previously reported on Merkel's risk-averse approach to foreign policy.  We do not expect her to change her leadership style because of success in Washington.  The real benefits for the U.S. lie in how success will affect the public understanding of how Germany can best build a relationship with Washington and its view of the U.S., the changing of which is a frequent theme in conversations with German leaders and thinkers.  A successful Summit will also reinforce our message that the U.S. and EU are natural partners, closely bound by common interests.  As a cautious conservative in a difficult coalition, Merkel will not run great risks for the U.S.  But, if she can show the public that cooperation with the U.S. works, the effect will be to cut the risk she runs by cooperating with the U.S.  It is a more complex path to a closer and more effective relationship than we would perhaps like, but our observation of Merkel and our conversations with her advisors lead us to see it as the best path available.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 DUBAI 000355  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  6/3/2017 TAGS: PREL PGOV PINS KNNP IR IZ AESUBJECT: DUBAI RULER DISCUSSES IRAN AND IRAQ WITH SENATOR LIEBERMAN  DUBAI 00000355  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Paul R Sutphin, Consul General, Dubai, UAE. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)     1.(S) SUMMARY.  Senator Joseph Lieberman met with Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MbR), Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, on 29 May.  MbR voiced support for US policy in Iraq, but expressed strong reservations about the al Maliki government and its links to Iran.  He called for new elections to produce leaders who would work for Iraq's interests. He voiced suspicion of Iran's goals in the region, and their claims that their nuclear program was for energy purposes alone.  He recommended, however, that the US seek to contain Iran through negotiations and diplomacy. Using force, he said, would only help the current leadership stay in power. MbR also talked about his ambitions for Dubai as a regional model, noting "we want to be number one." END SUMMARY  2.(SBU) Senator Lieberman, along with the Ambassador, Consul General, codel staff members and ConGen staff met MbR at the Zabeel Palace in Dubai on 29 May.  Joining MbR were Mohammad al-Gergawi, his principal aide and UAE Minister for Cabinet Affairs; Major General Dhahi Khalfan al-Tamim, Commander of the Dubai Police; Brigadier Mohammad al-Qemzi, Director of the Dubai General Department of State Security; Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, head of Dubai Civil aviation and Emirates Airlines; and a number of MbR's sons, including Sheikh Rashid bin Mohammad, Sheikh Mohammad's eldest son; and Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammad, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council and Sheikh Mohammad's heir apparent.  Iraq:  Any plan B? ------------------  3.(C) MbR restated the UAE's support for the US in the region, noting "the UAE is the only country that is 100 percent with the US." MbR said UAE support for the US effort remained firm, but asked what is "plan B" should the current US approach not stabilize Iraq. Senator Lieberman quoted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying "plan B is to make plan A work."  Alternative Approaches: New Elections in Iraq? --------------------------------------------- -  4.(S) Asked by the Senator for his advice on steps to move the situation in Iraq forward, MbR commented that he has little confidence in Iraqi PM al Maliki, and believes his loyalties lie elsewhere, i.e. Iran.  MbR suggested the way ahead would be improved by new elections, which he believes would now yield a better leader who is loyal to Iraq. Senator Lieberman noted he thought that al Maliki and his allies would oppose new elections.  The Problem of Al-Sadr ----------------------  5.(S) MbR said that at the moment Muqtada al-Sadr is the single most powerful person in Iraq; the US should act against him, i.e. arrest and imprison him.  Asked if new elections might not yield a al-Sadr victory, MbR made clear he thought Sunnis would now turn out in large numbers and that al-Sadr would not be able to win - were the election fair.  (Comment: Reflecting commonly-held thinking by UAE seniors, he clearly implied that al-Maliki had been elected through rigging in the last Iraqi vote.  End comment.)  Progress in Anbar Province: Look to the Tribes --------------------------------------------- -  6.(C) Commenting on the improved security situation in western Iraq, MbR voiced strong support for closer cooperation with the tribal sheikhs.  As has been proven, if the tribal leaders can be co-opted to work with the US, they have the ability to defeat or suppress Al-Qaeda.  He stressed the importance of working with the tribes without regard to their being Sunni or Shia.  Sheikh Mohammad on Iran -----------------------  7.(C) Senator Lieberman asked MbR for his views on Iran and US policies vis-`-vis Iran.  MbR stated Iran is a large country with great ambitions, a historic sense of its importance, and a desire to dominate the region culturally and politically. Iran has a long-term strategy for the region, and would like to recreate the Persian Empire and spread Shi'a Islam throughout area. Rehearsing themes often heard by US senior visitors, MbR said Iran "can make trouble throughout the region" if it is  DUBAI 00000355  002.2 OF 003   provoked.  While he suggested that Iran is the cause of the deteriorating situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, he also noted that Iran could make the situation in Afghanistan, for example, "explode" should chose to do so.  Iran Promises a Peaceful Nuclear Program ----------------------------------------  8.(C) MbR told the Senator that the UAE does not want Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. He said that during the recent visit of Iranian President Ahmadinejad to the UAE that the Iranians had promised their nuclear program is only to help meet domestic energy needs -- quipping "how much can we believe what the Iranians say is another question."  MbR seemed perplexed about the work of the IAEA inspectors and believed that they could provide an objective view of the program.  Senator Lieberman reminded MbR that Iran has blocked the inspectors and they have only been able to conclude that Iran will have the capacity to produce enriched uranium on a sufficient scale to either generate power or create a nuclear weapon within the next three to eight years.  Negotiations - the Best Course of Action ----------------------------------------  9.(C) MbR and the Senator briefly discussed the recent meeting in Baghdad between the US and Iran.  MbR saw this as a very positive move, recommending negotiations as the best way forward with Iran.  He said that threatening Iran encourages the Iranian leaders to be defiant.  Iranians are proud and the current extremist leadership would not only endure, but benefit from an attack by the US. Such attacks would ensure the continuing power of the current government (note: presumable by rallying all Iranians behind it in the face of a foreign enemy).  10.(C) Senator Lieberman commented would maintain the stick even while it considered the carrot, and that the two carrier battle groups now in the Gulf were sending a message to Iran.  MbR responded that everyone in the region knows the US is powerful and can fight two wars simultaneously.  He said that part of the problem "is the way you (the US) talk."  After making a demand, "you (the US) should take two steps back before your next action."  Everyone in the region needs to avoid the dangerous cycle of action and reaction.  The Israeli-Palestinian problem has worsened because actions are followed immediately by reactions without thought.  11.(S) Brigadier Mohammad al-Qemzi, who heads State Security in Dubai added that the Iranians are traditionally great game players.  He said that the US should play the game of negotiation and diplomacy (to contain Iran) rather than engaging in hostilities.  Al-Qemzi recommended working for the longer term, and believes that there will be a cultural and leadership change in Iran -- over time, Iran would change for the better.  UAE Support for Counter Proliferation -------------------------------------  12.(S) MbR reiterated the UAE's continued support of the US' counter proliferation efforts in the region.  Brigadier al-Qemzi added that the previous day and in the previous week the UAE had stopped Iranian vessels at US request suspected of carrying goods proscribed by the UN sanctions regime.  The UAE, he said, would continue to work with us to stringently enforce UN sanctions.  Dubai, the Region, and Transformation via Education --------------------------------------------- ------  13.(C) Noting Dubai appeared to be a model of tolerance and opportunity for the region, Senator Lieberman asked MbR to talk about his goals for the emirate. MbR said bluntly "we want to be number one."  But, he said that Dubai has only taken the first step on a journey of 1000 miles. He said that if Dubai plays it right, the whole region can develop like Dubai.  14.(SBU) MbR indicated that Dubai has succeeded because it is a place where all people can enjoy health, wealth, security, and the opportunity to succeed. Commenting on his recent announcement at the World Economic Forum in Jordan of a new $10 billion Mohammed Bin Rashid Foundation for education and job creation (septel), he said "God gave us wealth and we must give it back to the people in the region."  MbR sees Dubai as the leading city of a wide region and he commented "I am serving 1.5 billion [people] in the region."  MbR underscored that education is the key to regional modernization and moderation. In Dubai, he noted, "we are trying to teach people how to fish and not just giving a fish to our neighbor."  DUBAI 00000355  003.2 OF 003    15 (SBU) He also called for more US universities in Dubai, and asked for Senator Lieberman's help in resurrecting the possibility of the University of Connecticut building a sizeable campus here (note: this deal was put on hold by UCONN leadership after Connecticut state legislators and others objected to the UAE regulation which prevents the entry of Israeli passport holders).  16.(U) Senator Lieberman has cleared this cable.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)    1.(C) Summary: In a January 23 meeting in Dubai with U/S Burns, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum (MbR) expressed concern about the potential negative impact on Dubai of  possible future UN sanctions against Iran; he urged the quiet US-UAE cooperation on financial and export control restrictions against Iran, offering to set up a "joint committee" to this end.  He agreed that Iran should not have nuclear weapons, but warned of the dire regional consequences of military action.  U/S Burns said the US would protect its interests in the region and support Gulf governments in resisting efforts by Iran to dominate the region. He emphasized the importance of continued support for the Siniora government in Lebanon, and the high priority the US put on a renewed effort to move the Israelis and Palestinians toward peace.  U/S Burns raised the case of Amcit Vafa Valapour, which has been under criminal investigation in Dubai for nearly 16 months without charges before a court(although under the local system police charges have been filed); MbR asked his aides to ensure the case moved forward as rapidly and transparently as possible  End Summary.  2.(C) On January 23, U/S for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns met with MbR for one hour in MbR's downtown office.  Burns was accompanied by NEA PDAS Jim Jeffrey, the Ambassador, the Consul General, P Staff assistant Herro Mustafa and ConGen notetaker. MbR was accompanied by his sons Sheikh Hamdan (who chairs the Dubai Executive Council, the Emirate's governing body) and Sheikh Mayed; Minister for Cabinet Affairs (and Dubai Holdings head) Mohammed Gergawi; federal Minister for Education Dr. Hanif al Qasimi; Dubai General Security Service head Brigadier Mohammed al Qemzi; Dubai World head Sultan bin Sulayem; and Emirates Airlines chairman and Dubai Civil Aviation head Sheikh Ahmed bin Sayed al Maktoum. U/S Burns expressed admiration for the Dubai's rapid development, hailing it as an open and productive model that was now being emulated throughout the region.  3.(C) Lebanon: U/S Burns conveyed the gratitude of the Lebanese government for financial and other assistance from the UAE.  MbR said the UAE understands that the Siniora government needs regional support. U/S Burns urged continued assistance, noting the US will soon offer the Siniora government $1 billion for security and reconstruction efforts.  4.(C) Iran sanctions: U/S Burns highlighted the significance of the June 2006 international offer to negotiate with Iran to resolve the nuclear issue--the first official US offer to negotiate with Tehran in 27 years.  Tehran had rejected this broadly-supported, reasonable proposal, which offered economic incentives such as sanctions relief and the sale of civilian airliners in addition to negotiations.  U/S Burns said that the UNSCR 1737's limited sanctions were a first step to pressure Iran to compromise, but that absent Iranian movement another, more restrictive, sanctions resolution is likely in February. The US was also taking bilateral action through Treasury designations against Iranian banks that were funding terrorism.  5.(C) MbR expressed willingness to cooperate in financial restrictions against Iran, but urged that the cooperation be conducted quietly; he offered to set up a "joint committee" to do so (he did not offer details); he later repeated this offer with regard to military transfers (see para 8).  He voiced concern regarding the potential negative impact of economic sanctions on Dubai, and against the "good Iranians" -- including Dubai's estimated 350,000 Iranians residents. U/S Burns and Ambassador Sison expressed readiness to engage with Dubai on financial cooperation against Iran. (Note: the number of resident Iranians was supplied by Al Qemzi, and is higher that the 200-300 thousand usual cited by the Dubai officials.)  6.(C) Iran and Gulf Security: U/S Burns stated that the US will protect its interests and support its allies, like the UAE, in the face of Iranian attempts to dominate the Gulf.  This is why we have stationed a second carrier battle group there, and have detained Iranian agents in Iraq who were providing arms and bomb components used to kill US troops.  MbR stated that the UAE does not want Iran to have nuclear weapons, and urged continued international pressure on Iran, but expressed deep concern about the destabilizing consequences to the UAE and to region of a military strike.  He urged that the US find a way to stop or disarm Iran without using military force.  U/S Burns reiterated  DUBAI 00000059  002.2 OF 002   that the US wants a diplomatic solution, and is working with the UN and its allies toward this end; strong UAE support was important to this effort.  7.(C) MbR expressed hope for change inside Iran, which U/S Burns echoed.  Burns noted the US wants to support the influence of moderate Iranians and encourage Iran to engage in negotiations. Minister Gergawi mentioned rumors that Supreme leader Khamenei is suffering from prostate cancer.  Gergawi opined that the merchant class in Iran has been pressuring Ahmadinejad over his failing economic policy.  He asserted that the growing sectarian conflict in Iraq, as well as the hanging of Saddam Hussein (which, he implied, was inspired by Iranian pressure), have now undermined the possibility of a regional alliance between extremist Sunnis and Shia.  Regional Sunnis now blame Iran for instability in Lebanon and Iraq. (Note: Gergawi's family is of Iranian origin, and he acts as one of MbR's principal advisors on Iran.)  8.(C) Security cooperation: U/S Burns called the Gulf Cooperation Council a good forum for quiet security cooperation, and reiterated that the US seeks a close, productive dialogue with the UAE on Gulf security.  The US opposes arms sales to Iran and will urge its partners in the European Union, Russia and the Middle East to cooperate on this front.  MbR reiterated his offer to set up a committee to cooperate on these issues.  9.(C) Israel/Palestinians: U/S Burns stressed that the US believes progress between Israel and the Palestinians toward peace is central to regional stability, and supports the creation of a Palestinian state.  This would be "the best thing," MbR replied; a peace deal would make radical groups like HAMAS "everyone's enemy". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should be supported, particularly since HAMAS is funded by Iran.  MbR noted UAE assistance was again flowing to the Palestinians, although it had been suspended for a time because of corruption concerns.  U/S Burns said the US is careful to ensure its assistance is going to the Palestinian people, rather than the HAMAS government, and is confident in the assistance mechanisms now in place.  10.(C) Valapour case: U/S Burns raised the case of Amcit Vafa Valapour, who has been under criminal investigation in Dubai for nearly 16 months. U/S Burns said the US sought return of Valapour's passport, which has been held by the Dubai police. He underscored that, while he was taking no substantive position on the merits of the case, the US believes the case should move forward with due process as quickly as possible.  MbR was unfamiliar with the case, and turned to Gergawi for background. Gergawi outlined the Dubai government view of the case, saying the bottom line is that Valapour and his non-USC partners had profited from insider information in a deal on the Dubai Metro project with a corrupt Dubai official. "We don't tolerate corruption," Gergawi concluded.  The Consul General noted that he had recently met with the Dubai Attorney General (reftel) on the case.  The AG had agreed to meet with Valapour's US and Emirati representatives to help to resolve the issue.  MbR asked his aides to ensure the case moved forward as quickly and transparently as possible, and promised Valapour would receive fair treatment.  11.(C) Afghanistan: U/S Burns expressed appreciation for UAE assistance in Afghanistan, and urged support for the Karzai government. MbR asserted the UAE and US are partners against drugs, money laundering, and terrorism and in Afghanistan.  He said the best weapon against the Taliban was economic investment. U/S Burns outlined ongoing reconstruction efforts, and noted the difficulty of creating economically viable substitutes for drug crops.  MbR said Karzai is reluctant to tackle the drug issue because he fears decreased support in the provinces.  12.(C) Comment: MbR offered little new, other than his somewhat vague offer to create a bilateral committee to address financial and arms/technology flows to Iran. He is clearly concerned regarding the prospect of more comprehensive UN economic sanctions, given that Iran is Dubai's largest trading partner, an assertion often cited by Dubai officials (although good Dubai/Iran trade numbers are hard to come by).  We will follow up to try to get a better read on the scope of MbR's offer. SUTPHIN
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 HARARE 000638  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT FOR P, AF, AND AF/S FOR MOZENA AND HILL, NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR B. PITTMAN AND B. LEO; USAID FOR M. COPSON AND E. LOKEN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2017 TAGS: PGOV PREL ZISUBJECT: The End is Nigh   Classified By: Ambassador Christopher W. Dell under Section 1.4b/d  1.  (C)  Having said my piece repeatedly over the last three years, I won't offer a lengthy prescription for our Zimbabwe policy.  My views can be stated very simply as stay the course and prepare for change.  Our policy is working and it's helping to drive change here.  What is required is simply the grit, determination and focus to see this through.  Then, when the changes finally come we must be ready to move quickly to help consolidate the new dispensation.  THE SITUATION  2.  (C)  Robert Mugabe has survived for so long because he is more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in Zimbabwe.  To give the devil his due, he is a brilliant tactitian and has long thrived on his ability to abruptly change the rules of the game, radicalize the political dynamic and force everyone else to react to his agenda. However, he is fundamentally hampered by several factors: his ego and belief in his own infallibility; his obsessive focus on the past as a justification for everything in the present and future; his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics, including supply and demand); and his essentially short-term, tactical style.  3.  (C)  While his tactical skills have kept him in power for 27 years, over the last seven this has only been achieved by a series of populist, but destructive and ultimately self-defeating moves.  In reaction to losing the 2000 referendum on the constitution, a vengeful Mugabe unleashed his QGreen BombersQ to commit land reform and in the process he destroyed ZimbabweQs agricultural sector, once the bedrock of the economy.  While thousands of white farmers saw their properties seized, hundreds of thousands of black Zimbabweans lost their livelihoods and were reduced to utter poverty.  In 2005, having been forced to steal victory by manipulating the results of an election he lost, Mugabe lashed out again, punishing the urban populace by launching Operation Murambatsvina.  The result was wholesale destruction of the informal sector, on which as much as 70-80 percent of urban dwellers had depended, and the uprooting of 700,000 Zimbabweans.  The current inflationary cycle really began with Murambatsvina, as rents and prices grew in response to a decrease in supply.  4.  (C)  And now, faced with the hyperinflationary consequences of his ruinous fiscal policies and growing reliance on the printing press to keep his government running, Mugabe has launched Operation Slash Prices.  This has once again given him a very temporary boost in popularity (especially among the police, who have led the looting of retail outlets and now seem well positioned to take a leading role in the black market economy) at the cost of terrible damage to the country and people.  Many small grocery and shop owners, traders, etc., will be wiped out; the shelves are increasingly bare; hunger, fear, and tension are growing; fuel has disappeared.  When the shelves are still empty this time next week, the popular appeal of the price roll back will evaporate and the government simply doesnQt have the resources to replace the entire private commercial sector and keep Zimbabweans fed.  It may attempt to do so by printing more money, adding even more inflationary pressure on a system already reeling from the GOZQs quasi-fiscal lunacy combined with the price impact of pervasive shortages.  The increasingly worthless Zim dollar is likely to collapse as a unit of trade in the near future, depriving the GOZ of its last economic tool other than sheer thuggery and theft of othersQ assets.  5.  (C)  With all this in view, IQm convinced the end is not  HARARE 00000638  002 OF 004   far off for the Mugabe regime.  Of course, my predecessors and many other observers have all said the same thing, and yet Mugabe is still with us.  I think this time could prove different, however, because for the first time the president is under intensifying pressure simultaneously on the economic, political and international fronts.  In the past, he could always play one of these off against the other, using economic moves to counter political pressure or playing the old colonial/race/imperialist themes to buy himself breathing room regionally and internationally.  But he is running out of options and in the swirling gases of the new Zimbabwean constellation that is starting to form, the economic, political and international pressures are concentrating on Mugabe himself.  Our ZANU-PF contacts are virtually unanimous in saying reform is desperately needed, but won't happen while the Old Man is there, and therefore he must go (finding the courage to make that happen is another matter, however, but even that may be coming closer). This is not some sudden awakening on the road to Damascus, but a reflection of the pain even party insiders increasingly feel over the economic meltdown.  We also get regular, albeit anecdotal, reports of angry and increasingly open mutterings against Mugabe even in ZANU-PF's traditional rural bastions.   Beginning in March, the other SADC leaders finally recognized (in the wake of the terrible beatings of March 11 and the international outcry that followed Q another self-inflicted wound for Mugabe) that Zimbabwe is a problem they need to address.  Thabo Mbeki appears committed to a successful mediation and is reportedly increasingly irritated with MugabeQs efforts to manipulate him or blow him off altogether.  If Mugabe judges that he still commands all he surveys by virtue of being the elder statesman on the scene, he may be committing yet another serious blunder.  Finally, one does well to recall that the only serious civil disturbances here in a decade came in 1998 over bread shortages, showing that even the famously passive Shona people have their limits.  The terror and oppression of the intervening years have cowed people, but itQs anyoneQs guess whether their fear or their anger will win out in the end.  WHAT WILL THE END LOOK LIKE?  6.  (C)  This is the big, unanswerable question.  One thing at least is certain, Mugabe will not wake up one morning a changed man, resolved to set right all he has wrought.  He will not go quietly nor without a fight.  He will cling to power at all costs and the costs be damned, he deserves to rule by virtue of the liberation struggle and land reform and the people of Zimbabwe have let him down by failing to appreciate this, thus he neednQt worry about their well-being.  The only scenario in which he might agree to go with a modicum of good grace is one in which he concludes that the only way to end his days a free man is by leaving State House.  I judge that he is still a long way from this conclusion and will fight on for now.  7.  (C)  The optimal outcome, of course, and the only one that doesnQt bring with it a huge risk of violence and conflict, is a genuinely free and fair election, under international supervision.  The Mbeki mediation offers the best, albeit very slim, hope of getting there.  However, as Pretoria grows more and more worried about the chaos to its north and President MbekiQs patience with MugabeQs antics wears thin, the prospects for serious South African engagement may be growing.  Thus, this effort deserves all the support and backing we can muster.  Less attractive is the idea of a South African-brokered transitional arrangement or government of national unity.  Mbeki has always favored stability and in his mind this means a ZANU-PF-led GNU, with perhaps a few MDC additions.  This solution is more likely to prolong than resolve the crisis and we must guard against letting Pretoria dictate an outcome which  HARARE 00000638  003 OF 004   perpetuates the status quo at the expense of real change and reform.  8.  (C)  The other scenarios are all less attractive:  a popular uprising would inevitably entail a bloodbath, even if it were ultimately successful; MugabeQs sudden, unexpected death would set off a stampede for power among ZANU-PF heavy weights; a palace coup, whether initiated within ZANU-PF or from the military - in which Mugabe is removed, killed, exiled or otherwise disposed of, could well devolve into open conflict between the contending successors.   Similarly, some form of "constitutional coup" i.e., a change at the top engineered within the framework of ZANU-PFQs "legitimate" structures could well prove to be merely the opening bell in a prolonged power struggle.  None of the players is likely to go quietly into the night without giving everything they have, including calling on their supporters in the security services. Moreover, experience elsewhere would suggest that whoever comes out on top initially will struggle, and more than likely fail, to halt the economic collapse.  Thus, there is a good prospect of not one but a series of rapid-fire Qtransitions,Q until some new, stable dispensation is reached.  9.  (C)  The final, and probably worst, possibility is that Mugabe concludes he can settle for ruling over a rump Zimbabwe, maintaining control over Harare and the Mashona heartland, the critical forces of the National Reserve Force and CIO and a few key assets Q gold, diamonds, platinum and Air Zimbabwe to fund the good times.  Under this scenario the rest of the country, in one of the comradeQs favorite phrases, could Qgo hang,Q leaving it to the international community to stave off the worst humanitarian consequences.   WHAT OF THE OPPOSITION?  10.  (C)  ZimbabweQs opposition is far from ideal and I leave convinced that had we had different partners we could have achieved more already.  But you have to play the hand youQre dealt. With that in mind, the current leadership has little executive experience and will require massive hand holding and assistance should they ever come to power.  11.  (C)  Morgan Tsvangarai is a brave, committed man and, by and large, a democrat.  He is also the only player on the scene right now with real star quality and the ability to rally the masses.  But Tsvangarai is also a flawed figure, not readily open to advice, indecisive and with questionable judgment in selecting those around him.  He is the indispensable element for opposition success, but possibly an albatross around t heir necks once in power.  In short, he is a kind of Lech Walesa character:  Zimbabwe needs him, but should not rely on his executive abilities to lead the country's recovery.  Arthur Mutambara is young and ambitious, attracted to radical, anti-western rhetoric and smart as a whip.  But, in many respects heQs a light-weight who has spent too much time reading U.S. campaign messaging manuals and too little thinking about the real issues.  Welshman Ncube has proven to be a deeply divisive and destructive player in the opposition ranks and the sooner he is pushed off the stage, the better.  But he is useful to many, including the regime and South Africa, so is probably a cross to be borne for some time yet.  The prospects for healing the rift within the MDC seem dim, which is a totally unnecessary self-inflicted wound on their part this time.  With few exceptions Q Tendayi Biti, Nelson Chamisa Q the talent is thin below the top ranks. The great saving grace of the opposition is likely to be found in the diaspora.  Most of ZimbabweQs best professionals, entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, etc., have fled the country.  They are the oppositionQs natural allies and it is encouraging to see signs, particularly in South Africa and the UK, that these people are talking,  HARARE 00000638  004 OF 004   sharing ideas, developing plans and thinking together about future recovery.  12.  (C)  Unfortunately, among the MDCQs flaws is its inability to work more effectively with the rest of civil society.  The blame for this can be shared on both sides (many civil society groups, like the NCA, are single-issue focused and take the overall dynamic in unhelpful directions; others, like WOZA, insist on going it alone as a matter of principle), but ultimately it falls to the MDC as the largest and the only true political party, to show the way.  Once again, however, these are natural allies and they have more reason to work together than fight against each other.  STAYING THE COURSE, PREPARING FOR CHANGE  13.  (C)  If I am right and change is in the offing, we need to step up our preparations.  The work done over the last year on transition planning has been extremely useful, both for stimulating a fresh look at our own assumptions and plans and for forging a common approach among the traditional donor community.  But the process has lagged since the meetings in March in London and should be re-energized.  It is encouraging in this respect that USAID Washington has engaged the Mission here in discussing how we would use additional resources in response to a genuinely reform-minded government .  I hope this will continue and the good work done so far will survive the usual bloodletting of the budget process.  14.  (C)  The official media has had a field day recently whooping that "Dell leaves Zimbabwe a failed man".  That's not quite how it looks from here.  I believe that the firm U.S. stance, the willingness to speak out and stand up, have contributed to the accelerating pace of change. Mugabe and his henchman are like bullies everywhere:  if they can intimidate you they will.  But ther're not used to someone standing up to them and fighting back.  It catches them off guard and that's when they make mistakes. The howls of protest over critical  statements from Washington or negative coverage on CNN are the clearest proof of how this hurts them.  Ditto the squeals over Qillegal sanctions.Q  In addition, the regime has become so used to calling the shots and dictating the pace that the merest stumble panics them.  Many local observers have noted that Mugabe is panicked and desperate about hyperinflation at the moment, and hence heQs making mistakes.  Possibly fatal mistakes.  We need to keep the pressure on in order to keep Mugabe off his game and on his back foot, relying on his own shortcomings to do him in.  Equally important is an active U.S. leadership role in the international community.  The UK is ham-strung by its colonial past and domestic politics, thus, letting them set the pace alone merely limits our effectiveness.  The EU is divided between the hard north and its soft southern underbelly.  The Africans are only now beginning to find their voice.  Rock solid partners like Australia donQt pack enough punch to step out front and the UN is a non-player.  Thus it falls to the U.S., once again, to take the lead, to say and do the hard things and to set the agenda. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of ordinary Zimbabweans of all kinds have told me that our clear, forthright stance has given them hope and the courage to hang on.  By this regimeQs standards, acting in the interests of the people may indeed be considered a failure.  But I believe that the opposite is true, and that we can be justifiably proud that in Zimbabwe we have helped advance the PresidentQs freedom Agenda.  The people of this country know it and recognize it and that is the true touchstone of our success here.  DELL

CHRISTENSEN: 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1. (S) URGENT ACTION REQUEST:  IN SEPTEMBER DURING THEIR MEETING AT THE APEC SUMMIT IN SYDNEY AUSTRALIA, PRESIDENT BUSH DISCUSSED WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT HU STRONG CONCERNS RELATING TO THE ONGOING TRANSSHIPMENT VIA BEIJING OF KEY BALLISTIC MISSILE PARTS FROM NORTH KOREA TO IRAN'S MISSILE PROGRAM.  PRESIDENT BUSH PLEDGED TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT HU'S REQUESTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  EMBASSY SHOULD ON NOVEMBER 3 AT THE MOST EFFECTIVE LEVEL POSSIBLE, DELIVER THE NON-PAPER IN PARA 8 WHICH RELATES TO SPECIFIC, TIME- SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT AN IMMINENT TRANSSHIPMENT.  IN ADDITION, AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY POST SHOULD DELIVER THE NON-PAPER IN PARA 9 TO MFA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BY THE AMBASSADOR SINCE THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENTIAL-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS.  ---------- OBJECTIVES ----------  2. (S/REL CHINA) Post should:   --(This point for November 3 Delivery) Request China to stop an imminent shipment to Iran's ballistic missile program.  This is the same cargo that the Ambassador shared about on October 25 (ref E).  It is now scheduled to leave Beijing airport on November 4.  --(This point for November 3 Delivery) Note the importance of this demarche since it relates to a topic discussed by Presidents Bush and Hu in Sydney.  Embassy should further note that the Embassy will be seeking an appointment at the highest level possible to convey a more extensive presentation on this topic of ballistic missile parts from North Korea to Iran.  --Remind Chinese officials that President Bush has been personally engaged on the issue of the transshipment of ballistic missile parts between North Korea and Iran via Beijing and that he raised this issue with President Hu at the APEC Summit.  -- Seek information on the steps China has taken since the APEC discussion to address this issue and impress on them the necessity for China to take immediate strong action.  -- Stress that the credibility of UN Security Council actions must be maintained by vigorous implementation by UN Member States of UNSC resolutions calling for Chapter VII sanctions, particularly 1718, 1737, and 1747.  --Indicate that the U.S. believes that the proliferation of missile technology between North Korea and Iran will increase and that these two countries will attempt to conduct these transfers through Chinese territory.  --Emphasize the need to inspect cargo and personal goods on regularly scheduled flights transiting Beijing from North Korea to Iran in order to detect and deter these shipments.  --Explain to Chinese officials that the U.S. carefully reviews the intelligence material that we have on shipments before we share it, and we ask that Chinese authorities respect this and act on our information accordingly and appropriately.  --Indicate that the United States believes that we can work together cooperatively and effectively on these issues.  --Express our willingness to continue to share as much information as possible to assist China's efforts to uphold these UN Security Council resolutions.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- Background: Ballistic Missile Parts Shipped via Beijing Between North Korea and Iran. --------------------------------------------- -------------  3. (S/Rel China) Iran and North Korea have continued their longstanding cooperation on ballistic missile technology, via air- shipments of ballistic-missile related items.   We assess that some of these shipments consist of ballistic missile jet vanes that frequently transit Beijing on regularly scheduled flights on Air Koryo and Iran Air.  We believe that the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group (SBIG) is the probable end user for these parts.  SBIG is listed in the annex to UNSCR 1737 and these jet vanes are controlled under Item 10.A.2 of the Missile Technology Control Regime and Item 6 of China's missile- related export control regulations.  Moreover, UNSCRs 1718 and 1737 prohibit the transfer to or from North Korea or Iran, respectively, of jet vanes and any other item listed in UNSC document S/2006/815. These shipments therefore represent violations of UNSCRs 1718 and 1737.  4. (S/Rel China) The U.S. has raised this issue with China at the highest levels several times in the last few months.  In May 2007, the United States informed China of imminent shipments on three separate occasions (Refs A,B and C).  Though Chinese officials informed Embassy Beijing that China's investigations have found no evidence of these transfers, it appears that these shipments did occur and are continuing to transit via Beijing.  In addition this issue was raised by ISN PDAS Patricia McNerney during bilateral nonproliferation talks in August 2007 (Ref D).  The Deputy Secretary also raised this issue with Executive Vice Foreign Minister (EVFM) Dai Bingguo via during a telephone conversation in August.  Finally, in September 2007, President Bush discussed this issue with Chinese President Hu at the APEC summit in Sydney.  The two leaders agreed that the USG would provide the PRC with further information on these transfers.  5.  (S/Rel China) On October 25 the U.S. provided PRC officials with detailed information, including the airway bill and flight number, of another imminent shipment of military related goods from North Korea to Iran via Beijing.  This shipment was also assessed as destined for Iran's solid propellant missile development organization, the Shahid Bagheri Industries Group (SBIG).  We now have information that the goods will be shipped on November 4 and insist on a substantive response from China to this information.  6. (S/Rel China) Our information indicates that at least 10 air shipments of jet vanes have transited Beijing thus far and that these shipments will not only continue but will also grow in volume.  We have encouraged the Chinese to undertake frequent inspections of cargo on Air Koryo or Iran Air flights transiting Beijing from North Korea to both deter and detect these shipments.  7. (S/Rel China) The Department is seeking both immediate action on this new information and a strategic approach with regards to this critical issue.  We assess that the best way to prevent these shipments in the future is for Chinese authorities to take action, such as those identified in para 9, that will make the Beijing airport a less hospitable transfer point.  --------------------------------------------- -------- NON-PAPER ON URGENT MATTER TO BE DELIVERED NOVEMBER 3 --------------------------------------------- --------  8. (S/Rel China) Begin points:  -- Last week we raised with you information regarding North Korean plans to send a shipment, probably for Iran's ballistic missile program, to Iran.  We believe the cargo is intended for Iran's Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Iran's solid-propellant ballistic missile program.  You had requested additional information.  -- We now have reason to believe that the items above will be shipped to Iran via scheduled Iran Air flight on November 4.  --If these goods are missile-related, North Korea is prohibited under UNSCR 1718 from exporting missile-related items and UN Member States are prohibited from importing those items.  In addition, North Korea would potentially be precluded under UNSCR 1737 from transferring these items to Iran if they are among the missile-related components included in S/2006/815 or if North Korea or China determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.  Moreover, SBIG is designated in United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 and, as such, is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution. With these concerns in mind we are asking that Chinese authorities investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to Iran.  ------------------------------------------ BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR DELIVERY BY AMBASSADOR ------------------------------------------  9. (S/REL CHINA) Begin Points:  --Over the past several months we have raised with Chinese officials the problem of ballistic missile-related transfers between Iran and North Korea being transshipped through China.  President Bush raised U.S. concerns on this matter with President Hu during the APEC summit in Sydney, demonstrating the importance of the issue to the United States.  In response to President Hu's request for additional details, we are providing you further information regarding these activities. Specifically, we are urgently providing information regarding an imminent shipment of serious concern.  -- North Korea is prohibited under UNSCR 1718 from exporting missile- related items and UN Member States are prohibited from importing those items.  In addition, North Korea would  potentially be precluded under UNSCR 1737 from transferring these items to Iran if they are among the missile-related components included in S/2006/815 or if North Korea or China determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.  Moreover, SBIG is designated in United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 and, as such, is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution. With these concerns in mind we are insisting that Chinese authorities urgently investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to Iran.  --We are very concerned that North Korean shipments of jet vanes occur on regularly scheduled commercial air flights transiting through Beijing.  We believe this has been the case on about 10 flights.  --These items are likely intended for Iran's solid propellant missile development organization, the Shahid Bagheri Industries Group (SBIG).  --These cargo shipments probably include front companies.  --We have identified a large number of shipments beginning late last year of what are probably ballistic missile-related items that have transited Beijing, and we would like to share further information on these shipments.  --14 December 2006: A delegation from SBIG returned from Pyongyang probably via Beijing and transported what we assess to be jet vanes for a solid propellant medium range ballistic missile (MRBM) under development in Iran.  --On or about 15 January 2007: North Korea delivered what were probably jet vanes for Iran's developmental solid propellant MRBM to SBIG via Beijing on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or around 23 January 2007: North Korea delivered what were probably jet vanes for Iran's developmental solid propellant MRBM to SBIG via Beijing on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 16 May 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 24 May 2007: An air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 6 June 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  -- On or about 12 June 2007: An air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 14 June 2007: An air shipment composed of three what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 14 July 2007: An air shipment composed of ten what were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 26 July 2007: An air shipment possibly composed of an unknown number of jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --On or about 22 August: An air shipment possibly composed of one jet vane from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --We believe that the number of jet vanes sent to Iran will increase dramatically in the future.  --To date we believe that about 40 probable jet vanes have been sent from North Korea to Iran.  --The contract for these components called for a total number of 500 and we assess that shipments of these may increase to a rate of 100- 160 per month.  --In addition, our information indicates that a second order of 1,500 components - possibly additional jet vanes - was agreed to in December of last year.  -- We believe that this trade will continue to utilize regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights.  --As we have discussed on several occasions, Iran also has been seeking probable tungsten-copper alloy plates from China's Dalian Sunny Industries, also known as LIMMT.  Dalian Sunny Industries shipped part of an order for this material in September.  These plates are suitable for Iranian domestic production of jet vanes or as an insulator for ballistic missile components.  Iran could be seeking these plates in case North Korea is unable to provide the quantity or quality of jet vanes required.  --We urge you to prevent such shipments via whatever action you deem appropriate, including frequent inspection of Iran Air and Air Koryo flights.  The use of regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights indicates that frequent regular inspections of Iran Air flights and Air Koryo flights are in order and would help deter these shipments in the future.  --We will continue to provide you with relevant information to help end this proliferation.  ------------------------------ Reporting Requirement and POC ------------------------------  10.

Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (C) Summary.  Representative Gary Ackerman (D, New York), Chairman of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee, accompanied by the Ambassador, met with Opposition Leader Binyamin Netanyahu at the Knesset April 11.  The discussion covered Netanyahu's ideas on how to pressure Iran in order to block its nuclear program and topple President Ahmadinejad; Netanyahu's views on dealing with the Palestinians; his critique of Prime Minister Olmert's handling of the Second Lebanon War; and Netanyahu's analysis of Israel's domestic political situation. On Iran, Netanyahu advocated intensified financial pressures, including a U.S.-led divestment effort focused largely on European companies that invest in Iran, as the best way to topple Ahmadinejad.  On the Palestinians, Netanyahu did not object to supporting President Abbas but said Israel and the U.S. should first focus more on "strangling" Hamas.  Netanyahu asserted that Israel's mishandling of the Lebanon war had strengthened Israel's enemies.  He predicted that Olmert would not be able to stay in power much longer, then described several different mechanisms for forming a new government.  Netanyahu expressed confidence that the Israeli public recognized that he had been right, that unilateral withdrawals were a mistake, and that the priority now must be stopping Iran.  Netanyahu noted that he thought dropping the "right of return" was the acid test of Arab intentions and insisted that he would never allow a single Palestinian refugee to return to Israel.  End Summary.  2.  (U) House Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee Chairman Gary Ackerman, accompanied by the Ambassador, Pol Couns, Subcommittee Staff Director David Adams, and Staff member Howard Diamond called on Opposition and Likud Party Leader Binyamin Netanyahu at the Knesset April 11.  Netanyahu was joined by foreign policy adviser Dore Gold and MFA North American Department Congressional liaison Eyal Sela.  Toppling Ahmadinejad --------------------  3.  (C) Representative Ackerman told Netanyahu that in his meeting the day before with Egyptian President Mubarak, he had asked Mubarak if military action were necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, should the strike be carried out by the U.S. or Israel?  Mubarak had responded that if it came to that, the U.S. should do it and Israel should stay out.  Netanyahu said he took Mubarak's point, but commented that he thought the Iranian regime, or at least President Ahmadinejad, could be toppled by economic pressure, including a divestment campaign. Noting that economic sanctions lose their effect over time, but can be powerful in the short term.  The goal should be to encourage Ahmadinejad's political rivals to remove him from power. Afterward, if the pressure could be maintained it might be possible to bring down the entire Iranian regime, but that would also entail identifying alternative leaders.  The idea was to use economic pressure to create a public sense of regime failure.  Netanyahu said he had consulted with noted historian Bernard Lewis, who believed that Iran would be less dangerous once Ahmadinejad was removed.  4.  (C) Netanyahu said there were three bills in Congress designed to divest U.S. pension funds from investing in about 300, mostly European, companies currently doing business in Iran.  Divestment would immediately bring down the credit ratings of these companies, thus forcing them to respond. Netanyahu urged Congress to support the divestment legislation, adding that he also planned to use a visit to the U.S. to raise the issue with Wall Street fund managers. His approach was to tie in Darfur to expand the scope of anti-genocide divestment and link it to U.S. policy goals. Netanyahu said he was unsure that financial pressures would be enough to stop Iran's nuclear program, but he was confident they would succeed in bringing down Ahmadinejad. He commended Dore Gold's efforts to put Ahmadinejad on a genocide watch list as part of a broader effort to delegitimize the Iranian President.  Asked about the quality of U.S. and Israeli intelligence on Iran, Netanyahu said his nightmare was that we had missed part of the Iranian program. He added that if the current intelligence was correct, it would take Iran a few more years to develop a nuclear weapon.  He agreed with Ambassador Jones' assessment that  TEL AVIV 00001114  002 OF 003   Ahmadinejad's announcement of a breakthrough in Iran's centrifuge program was probably exaggerated.  It would be critical, Netanyahu stressed, to target companies investing in Iran's energy sector.  Bring Down Hamas ----------------  5.  (C) Congressman Ackerman asked Netanyahu for his views on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  Netanyahu said Abbas was a "nice man who means well," but he added that Israel and the U.S. should focus on "bringing down Hamas" through an "economic squeeze."  Netanyahu asserted that eight months ago, the Hamas government had been on the brink of collapse, but had become stronger because Israel became weaker as a result of the Lebanon war.  Without elaborating, Netanyahu said it would be easier to weaken Hamas than to strengthen Abbas.  6.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Shimon Peres had admitted to him that the Oslo process had been based on a mistaken economic premise, and as a result European and U.S. assistance to the Palestinians had gone to create a bloated bureaucracy, with PA employees looking to the international community to meet their payroll.  Netanyahu predicted that Palestinians would vote for Abbas if they believe that he can deliver the money.  He suggested putting in place an "economic squeeze with an address," so that Hamas would receive the popular blame.  Asked if Fatah knew how to conduct an election campaign, Netanyahu said the Palestinian patronage system should be forced to collapse, which would have an immediate impact since the entire Palestinian economy was based on graft and patronage. Instead, he asserted, the opposite was happening.  Hamas was also handling the prisoner release issue well since they had created the impression that Hamas was in control of the process and "sticking it to the Israelis."  7.  (C) Congressman Ackerman asked if Abbas would survive politically.  Netanyahu said he was unsure, since politics were stressful, especially Palestinian politics.  The policy, he added, should be to starve the NUG.  If any money is given, it should go directly to Abbas.  Netanyahu said it was not clear the GOI has a policy, there was a general climate of weakness.  Lebanon War Failures --------------------  8.  (C) Turning to the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu said the problem was not the war's goals but rather the disconnect between goals and methods.  If the IDF had used a flanking move by a superior ground force, it could have won easily. Instead, Israel "dripped troops into their gunsights," an approach he termed "stupid."  The top leadership had lacked a sense of military maneuver.  In addition, they had been afraid to take military casualties, but instead got many civilian casualties.  If Olmert had mobilized the reserves in ten days, seized ground, destroyed Hizballah in southern Lebanon, and then withdrawn, he would be a hero today. Instead, Netanyahu predicted, Olmert will not last politically.  Olmert's current public support levels of three percent were unsustainable.  A New Government? -----------------  9.  (C) Netanyahu said the pressure on Olmert was accumulating as a result of corruption investigations as well as the impending release of the Winograd Commission's interim report.  Olmert could be pushed out as a result of a rebellion within the Kadima Party.  Kadima members are realizing they cannot allow Olmert to stay in power, but Kadima itself might collapse since it was a "fake party." Netanyahu described several options, including Kadima replacing Olmert, a new coalition formed in the Knesset, or Netanyahu's preferred option, new elections.  New elections, he stated, are supported by sixty-five percent of the public.  Netanyahu insisted he was in no rush since he was "enjoying the time with his family" and rebuilding the Likud Party. Likud was reaching thousands of new supporters, including many highly educated professionals and high tech entrepreneurs, through the internet.  10.  (C) Netanyahu asserted there was a growing sense in the public that he had been right in the last election.  TEL AVIV 00001114  003 OF 003   Unilateral "retreats" (i.e. such as the withdrawals from Gaza and southern Lebanon) were the wrong way to go.  Israel had allowed an Iranian enclave to establish itself in Gaza. Syria was arming itself for the first time in 20 years, Hizballah had rearmed since the war, and Gaza was being turned into a bunker.  Egypt was not doing on a twelve mile front along the Gaza border what Jordan was doing on a 150-mile front.  The way out was to stop Iran, thereby dealing with the octopus, not just its tentacles.  Right of Return the Acid Test -----------------------------  11.  (C) Netanyahu stated that a return to the 1967 borders and dividing Jerusalem was not a solution since further withdrawals would only whet the appetite of radical Islam. Ackerman asked if the Palestinians would accept peace based on the 1967 lines.  Netanyahu said he would not agree to such a withdrawal since the 1967 lines were indefensible, but he added that the "right of return" was the real acid test of Arab intentions.  Instead of Israel making more step-by-step concessions, Israel should insist that further concessions be linked to reciprocal steps toward peace.  The Palestinians must drop the right of return and accept Israel's right to exist.  The Arab initiative did not meet this standard since it keeps the right of return open.  Israel will only have a peace partner when the Palestinians drop the right of return. Asked whether Israel could accept case by case exceptions, Netanyahu insisted not one refugee could ever return. Israel, after all, was not asking for the right of Jews to return to Baghdad or Cairo.  12.  (C) Netanyahu said UNSCR 242 was not a bad formula since it did not specify precisely from which territories Israel would withdraw.  After the withdrawals from Gaza and Lebanon, there was deep disillusionment among Israelis about the principle of land for peace.  Even the noted Israeli leftist writer AB Yehoshua had said in a recent interview that he despaired about peace because the Arabs wanted all of Israel.  From 1948 to 1967, the conflict had not been about occupied territories, but that point had been obscured by "effective propaganda."  The root of the conflict was an Arab desire to destroy Israel, which had now become part of the larger ambitions of radical Islam.  13.  (C) The 1967 borders were not the solution since Israel was the only force blocking radical Islam's agenda of overrunning Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  Netanyahu proposed that Israel offer to work with the Saudis against Iran.  If Iran was not stopped, there would be no agreement with the Palestinians, and the peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt would come under tremendous pressure.  There could be no deterrence against "crazies" such as Ahmadinejad.  Netanyahu advised Congress to expedite the legislative effort for divestment.  If that did not work, we could reconsider other options. Congressman Ackerman said that if Netanyahu came to Washington, he would hold a hearing on divestment.  14.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 002280  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  WHITE HOUSE FOR APHSCT TOWNSEND.  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2017 TAGS: PTER PREL KNNP KWBG EFIN IR ISSUBJECT: APHSCT TOWNSEND TAKES STOCK OF BMENA REGION WITH MOSSAD DIRECTOR DAGAN  Classified By: Charge d'affaires Gene A. Cretz for reasons 1.4 (B/D).  1. (S) SUMMARY:  Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (AFHSC), met Mossad Director Meir Dagan on July 12 for a general discussion of regional security threats.  On the Iranian nuclear program, Dagan proved surprisingly optimistic about the effects of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and their impact on Iranian elites.  On most other fronts, however, Dagan expressed deep skepticism regarding any near-term solutions.  Dagan believes that the Syrians were emboldened by the Second Lebanon War, and argued for a concerted international effort to enforce UNSC resolutions in Lebanon as a means of removing Syria from Iranian influence.  In Dagan's personal opinion, present attempts to prop up the government of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad will fail, and "an entirely new approach" with the Palestinians is required.  Dagan and Townsend surveyed political developments in North Africa, Turkey, and the Gulf, and shared concerns about Pakistan's ability to withstand the challenge of Islamic radicals. END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------------- Financial Sanctions Offer Hope on Iran --------------------------------------  2. (S) Mossad Director Meir Dagan began his two-hour meeting with Townsend by expressing satisfaction with sanctions against Iran.  Dagan said UNSC Resolutions 1737 and 1747 caught the Iranians off-guard, and were having an impact on the Iranian elite and financial community.  The resolutions had been particularly successful through their indirect consequences, explained Dagan, by stigmatizing Iranian businesses and discouraging risk-averse Europeans from being connected with Iran.  Dagan praised ongoing GOI-USG cooperation on this front, and added that domestic economic problems were creating additional pressure on the regime.  3. (S) With regard to their nuclear program, Dagan said the Iranians are attempting to convey a "false presentation" that they have mastered the uranium enrichment process.  The reality is that they are not there yet, said Dagan, and they are paying a heavy political price (sanctions) for something they have yet to achieve.  Dagan noted growing antipathy in Russia towards Iran and its nuclear program, and said the Iranians were shocked by Russian statements accusing them of supporting terrorism against the United States.  In Dagan's view, there is no ideological conflict within the Iranian leadership (all wish to see the destruction of Israel), but there is a growing divide on tactics with some supporting a retaliatory position against the West and others favoring new policies of moderation.  Recognizing the growing strength of the moderate camp, Dagan said that the militant followers of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are now trying to target supporters of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as spies.  --------------------------------------------- - Gulf States Await Action (From Others) on Iran --------------------------------------------- -  4. (S) According to Dagan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States all fear Iran, but want someone else "to do the job for them."  Townsend and Dagan discussed the current state of affairs in the Saudi royal court, where the Mossad Chief accused Foreign Minister Saud bin Faysal of playing a "very negative role."  He also pointed to the recent visit of the Saudi King Abdullah to Jordan as a historical first and turning point for relations between the two countries. Townsend agreed, and said that the Saudi king has a sense of urgency on the political front.  Dagan characterized Qatar as "a real problem," and accused Sheikh Hamid of "annoying everyone."  In his view, Qatar is trying to play all sides -- Syria, Iran, Hamas -- in an effort to achieve security and some degree of independence.  "I think you should remove your bases from there...seriously," said Dagan.  "They have confidence only because of the U.S. presence."  Dagan predicted, with some humor, that al-Jazeera would be the next cause of war in the Middle East as some Arab leaders (specifically Saudi Arabia) are willing to take drastic steps to shut down the channel, and hold Sheikh Hamid personally responsible for its provocations.  ---------------------------- Syria Taking Dangerous Risks ----------------------------   TEL AVIV 00002280  002 OF 003   5. (S) Dagan echoed other reports that Syria expects an Israeli attack this summer, and has raised its level of readiness.  Despite the fact that Israel has no intention of attacking, said Dagan, the Syrians are likely to retaliate over even the smallest incident, which could lead to quick escalation.  Dagan believes that Syria's strategic alliance with Iran and Hizballah has not changed, and that Assad views these policies as both "successful and just."  There is a tendency to assume that Syria can be separated from Iran, said Dagan, and that this offers the key to weakening Hizballah.  Dagan argued that the opposite is true:  by enforcing UN resolutions on Lebanon and increasing efforts to disarm Hizballah, the international community can remove the glue that binds Iran and Syria.  Enforcing the resolutions would put additional pressure on Assad, who fears being tried for the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri above all else.  The advantage of such an approach, continued Dagan, is that the legal ground is already in place for action by the UNSC.  This credible threat could sufficiently frighten Syria away from Iran and towards more natural allies in the Arab League.  --------------------------------------------- Deep Pessimism on Relations With Palestinians ---------------------------------------------  6. (S) Departing from official GOI policy, Dagan expressed his personal opinion that after more than a decade of trying to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians, "nothing will be achieved."  Only Israeli military operations against Hamas in the West Bank prevent them from expanding control beyond Gaza, lamented Dagan, without which Fatah would fall within one month and Abbas would join his "mysteriously wealthy" son in Qatar.  Offering what he believed to be a conservative estimate, Dagan said that USD 6 billion had been invested in the Palestinian Authority since 1994.  "What did it accomplish, other than adding a few more people to the Fortune 500?" asked Dagan.  Although he expressed his personal faith in Salam Fayyad, Dagan said that the Palestinian Prime Minister had no power base.  Fatah as a party would have to completely reorganize itself in order to regain credibility, argued Dagan, but instead they have turned once again to the "old guard."  The Mossad Chief suggested that a completely new approach was required, but did not provide Townsend any additional details.  -------------------------------------- Pakistan...and Other Regional Concerns --------------------------------------  7. (S) Townsend and Dagan then embarked on an informal tour of the region, comparing notes on countries critical to combating terrorism.  Dagan characterized a Pakistan ruled by radical Islamists with a nuclear arsenal at their disposal as his biggest nightmare.  Al-Qaeda and other "Global Jihad" groups could not be relied upon to behave rationally once in possession of nuclear weapons, said Dagan, as they do not care about the well being of states or their image in the media.  "We have to keep (President Pervez) Musharaf in power," said Dagan.  In North Africa, Dagan contended that Qaddafi needs to be pushed more in order to put Libya on the right track.  Qaddafi faces little domestic pressure, said Dagan, but has traditionally responded to outside threats and runs foreign policy based on his emotions.  The only reason Qaddafi moderated his position to begin with, said Dagan, was that he feared that he was "in the crosshairs" for regime change.  Dagan viewed the situation in Algeria as more serious, with the south of the country becoming increasingly dangerous and the leadership uncertain as it faces radical Islamic forces.  Morocco is coping better with these issues "in spite of the king," said Dagan, who appears to take little interest in governing.  In Turkey, Dagan said that Islamists there are not of the same cloth as others in the region, but he does fear that they are slowly breaking down the secular character of the state and could become more radical over time.  Dagan argued that if the Turkish military received more direct support from the United States, it would be better able to prevent the rise of Islamists.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv  You can also access this site through the State Department's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ********************  TEL AVIV 00002280  003 OF 003   CRETZ
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 TEL AVIV 002652  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/24/2017 TAGS: PREL PTER MARR MASS KNNP UNSC PK IR IZ ZPJO, EG, RS, CH, LE, SY, IS SUBJECT: U/S BURNS' AUGUST 17 MEETING WITH ISRAELI MOSSAD CHIEF MEIR DAGAN  Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones.  Reasons: 1.4 (b)(d).  ------- SUMMARY -------  1. (S) In an August 17 meeting, Israeli Mossad Chief Meir Dagan thanked Under Secretary Burns for America's support of Israel as evidenced by the previous day's signing of an MOU that provides Israel with USD 30 billion in security assistance from 2008-2018.  Dagan provided his assessment of the Middle East region, Pakistan and Turkey, stressing Israel's (a) concern for President Musharraf's well-being, (b) view that Iran can be forced to change its behavior, and (c) sense that Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are unstable with unclear futures ahead of them.  Dagan probed for more detail about U.S. military assistance to the Gulf states, and -- while signaling agreement with the U.S. approach to the Gulf states vis-a-vis Iran -- cautioned that they may not be able to absorb significant military assistance.  Dagan reviewed Israel's five-pillar strategy concerning Iran's nuclear program, stressed that Iran is economically vulnerable, and pressed for more activity with Iran's minority groups aimed at regime change.  Dagan urged caution in providing assistance to the Siniora government in Lebanon, noting Syrian and Iranian efforts to topple the GOL.  2. (S) Under Secretary Burns cited the MOU as tangible evidence of the USG's commitment to Israel, and stressed that the U.S. would support all of its friends -- Arabs included -- in the Middle East, and will remain engaged in the region for the long term.  He described U.S. efforts to support the Musharraf and Karzai governments as they face opposition from Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and explained that the Gulf Security Dialogue is meant to bolster Gulf states facing threats from Iran.  The Under Secretary reviewed U.S. efforts to isolate Iran and increase pressure on it, stressing that the U.S. is currently focused on the diplomatic track.  He shared USG thinking about the Siniora government in Lebanon, and urged that the U.S. and Israel continue to consult on Lebanon.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------------------- THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE MOU AND ISRAEL'S QME --------------------------------------------  3. (S)  Dagan observed that the signing of the MOU on security assistance could not have come at a better time, and stressed that Israel appreciated America's support.  The Under Secretary agreed about the timing, noting that the U.S., Israel and like-minded countries were facing multiple threats around the world, and that the Middle East is a very dangerous region.  He said that the MOU serves as a concrete reminder that the U.S. stands by its long-term security commitments to its friends, and is ready to help them with their needs.  The Under Secretary noted that the Middle East is now at the heart of American interests.  Because Egypt also plays a vital role in the region, the U.S. would also renew its security assistance commitment to that country. U.S. relations with the Gulf states were longstanding, and America would stay true to those friendships, as well.  The Under Secretary stressed that the USG is committed to Israel's QME.  He noted that the majority of systems and equipment that the U.S. would sell to Egypt and other Arab partners would replace items that had been sold to those countries in the past.  ------------------------------------------- DAGAN REVIEWS MIDDLE EAST, PAKISTAN, TURKEY -------------------------------------------  4. (S) Assessing the region, Dagan said Israel sees itself in the middle of a rapidly changing environment, in which the fate of one Middle Eastern country is connected to another. Dagan then said he was concerned about how long Pakistani President Musharraf would survive:  "He is facing a serious problem with the militants.  Pakistan's nuclear capability could end up in the hands of an Islamic regime."  Turning to Iran, Dagan observed that it is in a transition period. There is debate among the leadership between Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad and their respective supporters.  Instability in Iran is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic minorities.  This, Dagan said, presents unique opportunities, and Israelis and Americans might see a change in Iran in  TEL AVIV 00002652  002 OF 005   their lifetimes.  As for Iraq, it may end up a weak, federal state comprised of three cantons or entities, one each belonging to the Kurds, Sunnis and Shias.  5. (S) Dagan said that the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia are concerned about the growing importance of Iran and its influence on them.  They are taking precautions, trying to increase their own military defensive capabilities. Referring to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan warned that these countries would not be able to cope with the amount of weapons systems they intend to acquire:  "They do not use the weapons effectively."  6. (S) Dagan said that Jordan has successfully faced down threats from the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and that Egypt is struggling with the question of who will replace President Mubarak.  He said he sees no hope for the Palestinians, and that Israel looks at Syria and Lebanon, and sees only instability.  Further afield, it looks at Turkey and sees Islamists gaining momentum there.  The question, he asked, is how long Turkey's military -- viewing itself as the defender of Turkey's secular identity -- will remain quiet.  7. (S) If Israel's neighborhood were not unstable enough, Dagan observed, it did not help that Russia is playing a "very negative role" in the region.  He observed that all of these challenges have to be addressed globally -- they could not be dealt with individually.  Returning to Jordan as an example, he noted that the more than one million Iraqi refugees in Jordan were changing Jordanian society, and forcing it into a new relationship with Saudi Arabia.  This is evidenced by Saudi King Abdullah's recent visit to Jordan, which implies greater understanding between the Jordanians and the Saudis.  ---------------------------------------- DISCUSSION OF THE GULF SECURITY DIALOGUE ----------------------------------------  8. (S) Turning to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan said that enhancing the capabilities of the Gulf states "is the right direction to go," especially as they are afraid of Iran.  Such a U.S. commitment will be a stabilizing factor in the region.  Dagan clarified that he would not oppose U.S. security assistance to America's Arab partners.  He expressed concern, nevertheless, about the current policies of those partners -- especially with regards to Syria and Iran.  Dagan added that if those countries must choose between buying defensive systems from the U.S. or France, then he would prefer they buy systems from the U.S., as this would bring them closer to the U.S.  9. (S) Dagan observed that the challenge facing the U.S. now is how to unite the Gulf states under a shared policy, and pointed to Qatar as the weakest link in the chain, trying to play all sides.  Under Secretary Burns replied that the U.S. is trying to get Qatar and its neighbors to look at issues from a regional perspective, and to focus on threats in a unified way.  Acting PM Assistant Secretary Mull expressed understanding for Israel's frustration with how the region looked, but stressed nevertheless that if America did not engage the Gulf states through the GSD, the situation would become much worse.  It is critical to get the Gulf states focused on the Iran threat, and to adopt a regional approach to countering it.  Encouraging and supporting their counterproliferation efforts would be crucial.  Dagan said he agreed with this approach, stressing that the threat of radical Islam is real.  --------------------------------------------- ---- IRAN: DAGAN REVIEWS ISRAEL'S FIVE PILLAR STRATEGY --------------------------------------------- ----  10. (S) Dagan led discussion on Iran by pointing out that the U.S. and Israel have different timetables concerning when Iran is likely to acquire a nuclear capability.  He clarified that the Israel Atomic Energy Commission's (IAEC) timetable is purely technical in nature, while the Mossad's considers other factors, including the regime's determination to succeed.  While Dagan acknowledged that there is still time to "resolve" the Iran nuclear crisis, he stressed that Iran is making a great effort to achieve a nuclear capability: "The threat is obvious, even if we have a different timetable.  If we want to postpone their acquisition of a  TEL AVIV 00002652  003 OF 005   nuclear capability, then we have to invest time and effort ourselves."  11. (S) Dagan described how the Israeli strategy consists of five pillars:  A) Political Approach: Dagan praised efforts to bring Iran before the UNSC, and signaled his agreement with the pursuit of a third sanctions resolution.  He acknowledged that pressure on Iran is building up, but said this approach alone will not resolve the crisis.  He stressed that the timetable for political action is different than the nuclear project's timetable.  B) Covert Measures: Dagan and the Under Secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting.  C) Counterproliferation: Dagan underscored the need to prevent know-how and technology from making their way to Iran, and said that more can be done in this area.  D) Sanctions:  Dagan said that the biggest successes had so far been in this area.  Three Iranian banks are on the verge of collapse.  The financial sanctions are having a nationwide impact.  Iran's regime can no longer just deal with the bankers themselves.  E) Force Regime Change:  Dagan said that more should be done to foment regime change in Iran, possibly with the support of student democracy movements, and ethnic groups (e.g., Azeris, Kurds, Baluchs) opposed to the ruling regime.  12. (S) Dagan clarified that the U.S., Israel and like-minded countries must push on all five pillars at the same time. Some are bearing fruit now; others would bear fruit in due time, especially if more attention were placed on them. Dagan urged more attention on regime change, asserting that more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic minorities in Iran.  He said he was sure that Israel and the U.S. could "change the ruling regime in Iran, and its attitude towards backing terror regimes."  He added, "We could also get them to delay their nuclear project.  Iran could become a normal state."  13. (S) Dagan stressed that Iran has weak spots that can be exploited.  According to his information, unemployment exceeds 30 percent nationwide, with some towns and villages experiencing 50 percent unemployment, especially among 17-30 year olds.  Inflation averages more than 40 percent, and people are criticizing the government for investing in and sponsoring Hamas, saying that they government should invest in Iran itself.  "The economy is hurting," he said, "and this is provoking a real crisis among Iran's leaders."  He added that Iran's minorities are "raising their heads, and are tempted to resort to violence."  14. (S) Dagan suggested that more could be done to get the Europeans to take a tougher stand against Iran.  Under Secretary Burns agreed, and suggested that Israel could help  SIPDIS by reaching out to the Europeans.  Dagan said that Israel is already doing this, and would continue to do so.  Dagan reiterated the need to strike at Iran's heart by engaging with its people directly.  Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts are important, but more radio transmissions in Farsi are needed.  Coordination with the Gulf states is helpful, but the U.S. should also coordinate with Azerbaijan and countries to the north of Iran, to put pressure on Iran.  Russia, he said, would be annoyed, but it would be fitting, as Russia appears bent on showing the U.S. that it cannot act globally without considering Russia.  15. (S) Under Secretary Burns stressed that the USG is focused on Iran not only because of its nuclear program, but also because it supports terrorism and Shiite militias in Iraq.  The U.S. approach is currently focused on the diplomatic track and increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions.  Work in the UNSC helps to define the Iranian nuclear threat as one that affects international security, and not just that of Israel.  While UNSC members Russia, China and Qatar will water down efforts to increase pressure on Iran, it is still worthwhile to push for a third sanctions resolution.  In the meantime, the U.S. will encourage the Europeans, Japan and South Korea to implement unilateral sanctions against Iran outside the UNSC framework.  The U.S.  TEL AVIV 00002652  004 OF 005   will continue to encourage banks and financial institutions to slow down their operations in Iran and financially isolate it.  Regarding military pressure, the Under Secretary noted that the U.S. has deployed 1-2 carrier battle groups in the Gulf over the last six months, and that President Bush has stated that he will interrupt Iran's activity in Iraq.  As for outreach to the Iranian people, the VOA is now broadcasting programs in Farsi, and the USG is trying to get more Iranian students to visit the U.S. to promote people-to-people relations.  ----------------------------------------- PAKISTAN:  ISRAEL WORRIED ABOUT MUSHARRAF -----------------------------------------  16. (S) On Pakistan, Dagan said that President Musharraf is losing control, and that some of his coalition partners could threaten him in the future.  The key question, Dagan said, is whether Musharraf retains his commander-in-chief role in addition to his role as president.  If not, he will have problems.  Dagan observed that there has been an increase in the number of attempts on Musharraf's life, and wondered whether he will survive the next few years.  Under Secretary Burns replied that South Asia has assumed vital importance in American foreign policy since September 11.  The U.S. is committed to denying Afghanistan as a safe-haven for Taliban and Al-Qaeda activity.  The USG will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf, and is seeking to boost his military defensive capabilities.  At the same time, the U.S. is encouraging Pakistan and Afghanistan to work with each other militarily.  Turning to India, Under Secretary Burns noted that U.S.-Indian economic cooperation is growing, and that the USG is working effectively to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan.  ----------------------------- LEBANON:  DAGAN URGES CAUTION -----------------------------  17. (S) Dagan urged caution with respect to Lebanon, noting that the results of efforts there to bolster the Siniora government would impact Syria and Iraq.  The U.S. and Israel, he said, are on the edge of achieving something in Lebanon, and so cannot afford to drop their guard.  What is necessary is finding the right way to support PM Siniora.  "He is a courageous man," Dagan said.  Syria, Iran and Hizballah are working hard against him.  Dagan noted that much of what is animating the leadership of Lebanon to take on Syria is personal:  "Hariri, Jumblat and others had their parents executed by the Syrians."  This anti-Syrian sentiment has forged an alliance based on personal and national interests. Siniora has worked well with the situation, but Dagan suggested that the odds are against him.  Under Secretary Burns replied that the U.S. is trying to give PM Siniora as much support as possible, and that we would continue to consult closely with Israel on Lebanon.  He noted that he would return to Israel in October.  -------------------- MEETING PARTICIPANTS --------------------  18, (SBU) Accompanying Under Secretary Burns in the meeting were: -- Ambassador Richard H.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 000064  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/05/2017 TAGS: PREL PTER PGOV IS KWBGSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE SECRETARY'S JANUARY 13-15 VISIT TO ISRAEL   Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (S) Madam Secretary, internal tensions among GOI leaders have intensified since your last visit and have reached the point that there appears to be little coordination or even dialogue among the key decision makers.  Therefore, we will need to be sensitive to perceptions that we are favoring one faction over another.  The divisions at the top here are part of an increasingly gloomy public mood, with a new corruption allegations making headlines virtually daily, and a growing sense of political failure despite Israel's strong economy and a sustained success rate in thwarting suicide attacks. Prime Minister Olmert's approval ratings were only 23 percent in the latest poll, and Israeli interlocutors across the political spectrum are speaking openly of a crisis of public confidence in the country's leadership at a time when Israelis feel an urgent need for strong leadership to face the threats from Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hizballah.  OPTIMISM ERODING ----------------  2.  (S) The year 2007 has started off badly for Israelis. The good feeling generated by PM Olmert's long-delayed December 23 summit meeting with Abu Mazen quickly dissipated under the weight of reports of a new settlement in the Jordan Valley (now suspended by Peretz), continued Qassam rocket attacks on Sderot and neighboring kibbutzim, foot-dragging on both sides in implementing the transfer of tax revenues, lack of progress on the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, and the unpleasant atmospherics of the January 4 Olmert-Mubarak summit, which was overshadowed by a botched IDF daylight raid in the center of Ramallah in which four Palestinians were killed.  3.  (S) The Ramallah operation, which was authorized by the IDF's West Bank commander without informing the Minister of Defense, served as a stark reminder of the lack of coordination between Israel's military and its civilian leadership.  When it comes to Israel's strategy for dealing with Palestinians, it increasingly seems that military is military, civilian is civilian and never the twain shall meet!  Despite Olmert's belated embrace of Abu Mazen as a peace partner, there is growing concern that moderate Arab willingness to maintain the embargo on Hamas may be eroding, and that Fatah may fail to muster the popular support it will need to depose Hamas, whether at the ballot box or in the streets.  Meanwhile, the upcoming release of the results of the Winograd Commission's investigation of the Lebanon war hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of Olmert, Defense Minister Peretz, and IDF Chief of General Staff Halutz.  Peretz and Halutz have both publicly stated that they will resign if the Commission holds them responsible for serious errors in the conduct of the war, but Olmert has refrained from public comments.  Olmert is also awaiting the results of several separate investigations involving corruption allegations, any one of which could further damage him severely, if not force his resignation.  4.  (S) While Israeli anxiety over a possible dramatic shift of U.S. policy as a result of the Iraq Study Group's report has been allayed by statements by you and the President, there continues to be deep uneasiness here that the Baker-Hamilton recommendations reflect the shape of things to come in U.S. policy.  Israelis recognize that U.S. public support for the Iraq war is eroding and are following with interest the President's upcoming articulation of the revamped policy, but they are deeply concerned that Israeli-Palestinian issues not become linked in American minds to creating a more propitious regional environment for whatever steps we decide to take to address the deteriorating situation in Iraq.  5.  (S) Iran's nuclear program continues to cause great anxiety in Israel.  Given their history, Israelis across the political spectrum take very seriously Ahmadinejad's threats to wipe Israel off the map.  Olmert has been quite clear in his public comments that Israel cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran, a position stated even more emphatically by opposition leader Netanyahu, who compares today's Iran to Nazi Germany in 1938.  Despite the worst-case assessments of Israeli intelligence, however, there is a range of views about what action Israel should take.  The MFA and some of the think tank Iran experts appear increasingly inclined to state that military action must be a last resort and are taking a new interests in other forms of pressure, including but not limited to sanctions, that could force Iran to abandon its military nuclear program.  The IDF, however, srikes us as more inclined than ever to look toward a military strike, whether launched by Israel or by us, as the only way to destroy or even delay Iran's plans.  Thoughtful  TEL AVIV 00000064  002 OF 003   Israeli analysts point out that even if a nuclear-armed Iran did not immediately launch a strike on the Israeli heartland, the very fact that Iran possesses nuclear weapons would completely transform the Middle East strategic environment in ways that would make Israel's long-term survival as a democratic Jewish state increasingly problematic.  That concern is most intensively reflected in open talk by those who say they do not want their children and grandchildren growing up in an Israel threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran.  LIVNI RISING ------------  6.  (C) FM Tzipi Livni is frustrated by Olmert's continued refusal to coordinate closely, and -- perhaps with an eye on polls showing her popularity at over double the level of the Prime Minister -- suggested to a Ha'aretz interviewer in late December that she would challenge Olmert for the prime ministership if he continued not to give her his full backing.  In the same interview, Livni provided an outline of her thinking, but not a detailed plan, on the way ahead with the Arabs, including negotiating an interim agreement with the Palestinians in which the separation barrier would serve as the border, and refusing to engage with Syria unless Asad takes steps to end support for terrorism and distances himself from Iran.  Livni's policy adviser has confirmed to us that she has engaged in her own discrete discussions with Palestinians, but very much in an exploratory mode.  Livni told Senators Kerry and Dodd that she doubted that a final status agreement could be reached with Abu Mazen, and therefore the emphasis should be on reforming Fatah so that it could beat Hamas at the polls.  MFA officials tell us that Livni is also focused on the need to keep Hamas isolated. She and her senior staff have repeatedly expressed concern that some EU member-states are wobbly on this point. Meanwhile, Livni is keenly aware that unlike Olmert, she has little to fear from the Winograd Commission report (nor is she tainted by the corruption allegations that dog Olmert). Her incipient bid to take Olmert's place could become more serious once the report's preliminary conclusions are released next month.  SHIFTING VIEWS ON SYRIA -----------------------  7.  (S) Olmert and Livni agree that negotiations with Syria would be a trap that Damascus would use to end the international pressure on it and to gain a freer hand in Lebanon.  While they see public relations downsides to dismissing Syrian peace overtures out of hand, they continue to insist that no negotiations will be possible until Syria reduces its support for terrorism and/or takes direct steps to secure the release of Israeli prisoners held by Hamas and Hizballah.  Olmert and Livni are supported in that view by Mossad chief Dagan, who takes a dim view of Syrian intentions.  A significant part of the security establishment, however, appears to be reaching the conclusion that it is in Israel's interest to test Asad's intentions -- possibly through the use of a back channel contact -- and to seek to wean him away from Tehran.  They are joined in that view by Defense Minister Peretz, much of the Labor Party and the Israeli left, who argue that Israel cannot afford to refuse to at least explore Asad's offer to negotiate, often comparing that stance to Golda Meir's much-criticized decision to spurn Sadat's offer to negotiate, which then led to the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Press reports January 5 stated that the defense establishment had recommended to Olmert that he open an exploratory channel to Damascus in two months, a timeline reportedly linked to the completion of reviews of U.S. policy toward Iraq and the Middle East, as well as to clearer indications of Abu Mazen's intentions and capabilities vis a vis Hamas.  PERETZ-OLMERT TENSIONS ----------------------  8.  (C) According to leaks from a recent Labor Party leadership meeting, Amir Peretz said that he feels completely disconnected from Olmert.  Ever since Peretz' telephone conversation with Abu Mazen which infuriated Olmert, the two reportedly barely speak to each other.  Television news reports on January 4 trumpeted rumors that Olmert had decided to remove Peretz as Defense Minister and replace him with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has already announced plans to challenge Peretz for the Labor Party's leadership in late May primaries.  Even though the Prime Minister's Office almost immediately denied the reports, there is little doubt here that someone in the PMO was behind them.  While much of the Labor Party feels that Peretz has been a failure, both as Defense Minister and as Party Secretary General, and Peretz' popularity with the general public has hit rock bottom, Labor  TEL AVIV 00000064  003 OF 003   members widely condemned the media trial balloon, which they saw as an unacceptable attempt by Olmert's advisers to intervene in their party's leadership contest.  In any event, the incident is yet another indication of the intense degree of personal rancor and dysfunction prevailing at the top of the GOI.  PERETZ AND SNEH OUR AMA PARTNERS --------------------------------  9.  (C) Notwithstanding the GOI's internal discord, there is some good news in our efforts to nudge the GOI toward improvements in Palestinian quality of life issues.  Despite his political woes, Peretz has proven himself a serious partner in our efforts to implement the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA) and more generally in a slow but steady push by the MOD to force a reluctant IDF to accept steps to reduce barriers to Palestinian movement and to revive the Palestinian economy.  Deputy Defense Minister Efraim Sneh, who will likely accompany Peretz to your meeting, has emerged as the point man for these efforts.  Sneh shares Peretz' conviction that Israel's security stranglehold on the Palestinians is "winning the battle but losing the war," but Sneh, who in a decades-long career served as a military governor of the West Bank, commanded an elite combat unit, and took part in the famed Entebbe raid, also has both an intimate knowledge of the Palestinians and a combat commander's credibility with the IDF that Peretz sorely lacks.  Your meeting with Peretz provides an opportunity to express appreciation for his and Sneh's efforts and to encourage them in their struggle to bring recalcitrant elements in the IDF to heel.  The more progress we can achieve with them on AMA implementation now, the easier it will be to achieve meaningful results with both parties in the coming year.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv  You can also access this site through the State Department's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001643SIPDISDEPARTMENT ALSO FOR EUR/SE (GARBE)E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2018TAGS: PGOV SCUL TUSUBJECT: TURKEY: CHARITY FUND SCANDAL PROMPTS PM ERDOGANBATTLE WITH PRESS TYCOONREF: ANKARA 1626 Classified By: POL Counselor Daniel O'Grady, reasons 1.4 (b,d)1. (C) SUMMARY. A very public and ugly battle has erupted between Prime Minister Erdogan and the Dogan Group. The conflict dominated the news this week after Erdogan lashed out at business and media mogul Aydin Dogan for reporting on allegations in a German court that the German-based Deniz Feneri Charity laundered funds to individuals in Turkey who are close to Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). The charges focus public attention on widespread allegations about corruption in the AKP, a key vulnerability for the party. Still, Erdogan seems indifferent to reporting on the scandal in other media outlets, and has turned his wrath solely on the Dogan Group with competing charges about corruption linked to a zoning deal for the Istanbul Hilton. Erdogan launched a milder campaign against the Dogan group in Febuary for carrying pornographic photos of women on its front pages, but the latest attack is a significant escalation of tensions. Erdogan has not been this truculent since long before the AKP court closure case; ironically, the new scandal has fed speculation that a second closure case could result. END summary.It Only Took A Spark--------------------2. (SBU) On September 1 the first court case against Deniz Feneri convened in the Frankfurt Regional Court. By September 5, German Prosecutor Kerstin Lotz publicly stated that the Turkish Government tried to intervene in the case and wanted suspects released. The next day, CHP leader Deniz Baykal announced on NTV, a non-Dogan media outlet, that Mehmet Gurhan, International Director at Kanal 7, acknowledged he took money from the German Deniz Feneri and passed it to PM Erdogan. Baykal implied that he Prime Minister and his party were direct recipients of funds embezzled from the charity. Dogan's three flagship papers  Hurriyet, Milliyet, and Radikal  quickly picked up the story the next day with screaming, front-page banner headlines.3. (U) In response, Erdogan publicly charged Dogan with corruption regarding a zoning application for new residences at the Istanbul Hilton. Dogan responded to the allegation by declaring: The German judiciary claimed that the Prime Minister was involved in this case. The main opposition party leader announced this on NTV, but I am having difficulty understanding why I stand accused of reporting this in my papers. In a second attack, the Prime Minister announced that Dogan had not been granted permission by the Turkish Board of Television and Radio (RTUK) to use an additional TV terrestrial frequency that he had purchased. Dogan denied Erdogan's charges and accused the Prime Minister of trying to stifle any press criticism of himself.Tango with Turkey's Rupert Murdoch-------------------------4. (C) Dogan Media Holdings owns several mainstream daily newspapers and three major television stations. Although relations between Erdogan and Dogan have never been particularly warm, a detente of sorts has existed for most of the Erdogan administration. Dogan media players were only moderately critical of the Government, and the Goverment did not put undue pressure on Dogan's other business interests. Long before the public barbs, a familiar behind-the-scenes tango was taking place. Because of the Turkish media ownership structure, media owners use their press resources to curry favor with the Government on behalf of their own businesses. They also punish governments that, in their view, do not give them a sufficient cut of Government largesse. With control of 30-40 percent of the nation's media, Dogan is a major player in this game. Two years ago, the goverment fined Dogan's Petrol Offisi $200 million for tax evasion. This appears to have been the spark that ignited the current tensions.Erdogan Spokesman on the Media: Feed the Beast or ElseAnkara 00001643 002 of 002----------------------------------------- ------------5. (C) PM Spokesman Akif Beki contends, It's a media habit. They want something; they don't get it, so they attack. He defended RTUK's refusal to allow Dogan to use his recently purchased terrestrial television channel by arguing that this station would have put Dogan in control of more than 50 percent of the media. Beki also believes this fight will not last long. Dogan is wrong, he argued, because he is printing allegations being adjudicated in a German court as (if they are) pure truth. AKP Vice Chairman Nihat Ergun made the same point to us in a September 11 meeting at the Parliament. (COMMENT: Although Beki contends that Erdogan's criticism is justifed and that the Prime Minister has actually shown admirable restraint, there are suggestions of a deliberate political move against Dogan. Several weeks ago, Minister of Trade Simsek told a group of investors in London to sell their Dogan stock because Dogan won't be around much longer. END COMMENT) Indeed, after Erdogan's attacks began last week, Dogan stock fell 8 percent. And although Dogan Holding showed a profit last year, several media and business sources have indicated the lack of government tenders and contracts is beginning to hurt the massive conglomerate.6. (SBU) Last fall the editorial stance noticeably shifted at Dogan's flagship newspaper, Hurriyet. The paper became more critical of the government. xxxxx described for us several factors which he said led to the shift. Among them was the Petrol Offisi case, a decision by the Government not to issue a valuable Ceyhan oil refinery tender to Dogan, and a blistering speech Erdogan made to a closed AK Party meeting where he called Dogan a crooked businessman. The last item was taken personally by xxxxx because Dogan has supported Erdogan in his press on certain issues in the past.Comment--------7. (C) This battle could be seen as just a very direct and personal fight between two titans. However, coming on the heels of other recent accusations of corruption in the AKP, the Dogan attacks may represent a broader shift in Government-media relations. Such shifts have been seen with other governments in the past. In earlier cases, however, the media did not generally escalate attacks until a government appeared at the end of its life, like sharks smelling blood in the water. With Erdogan's approval ratings still over 50 percent, it will be difficult to maintain such a criticism level absent hard evidence and actual convictions. Still, only six weeks after the conclusion of the AKP closure case, it is striking that media coverage is predicting the AKP could face closure again if these or additional corruption charges are substantiated.Visit Ankara's Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turk eyWilson
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000536SIPDISSIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2018TAGS: PGOV TUSUBJECT: TURKEY: RULING AKP TO TRY TO OVERCOME CLOSURE CASEBY AMENDING CONSTITUTIONREF: ANKARA 526 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: PolCouns Janice G Weiner, reasons 1.4 (b), (d)1. (C) Summary: Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is drafting a mini-constitutional amendment package to attempt to overcome the closure case filed against it in Constitutional Court. The package will include a temporary clause that would wipe out existing closure cases, including against the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). If necessary, the GOT would be prepared to take the package to referendum. End summary.2. (C) xxxxx told us March 19 the party is hard at work on a mini-constitutional amendment package. The party sees the closure case as political in nature. Its intent, he stated, is to decapitate the party and ban PM Erdogan from politics. By the weekend, a small AKP committee will have drafted a package to deal with future party closure cases; it will include a temporary article intended to eliminate existing closure cases, including the case against the DTP. AKP will then sit down and talk with the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) in parliament, which, according to MHP General Secretary Cihan Pacaci, is drafting its own package. Pacaci will speak to MHP's proposal on the floor of parliament March 20, in a manner designed to condemn party closures in general and avoid the specifics of existing cases.3. (C) With respect to the concern voiced by many that the current case is untouchable because Article 138 of the Constitution prohibits legislative activity on ongoing cases, xxxxx said that much in the large body of legislation parliament has passed in AKP's five years in government has touched on issues before the courts. It is a basic principle of Turkish law that if a new provision works in someone's favor, the person may benefit from it; if it would work against the person, it does not apply. They will forge ahead.4. (C) xxxxx AKP will work at a compromise with MHP; if that is not possible, AKP will push the package through parliament. AKP on its own (likely with DTP, which stands to benefit) has more than the 330 votes required to send a constitutional amendment package to referendum. Pacaci, who claimed to know the contents of the AKP package, said he did not like it. He confirmed that in the absence of agreement with MHP (which would give the package a vote total that would obviate the need for a referendum), AKP would likely send it to referendum.5. (C) Asked whether AKP, in pushing such a package, was not playing with fire, xxxxx responded the party had concluded it would be more dangerous for the country to go through another prolonged period of political and economic instability and uncertainty than to face this head on. It was preferable to take abrupt, decisive action to cut off the closures cases; then the GOT could proceed with its agenda. He did not believe this was a matter in which the military would interfere. Both xxxxx to us that AKP had made mistakes, including failure actively to push its parliamentary agenda in recent months, and its failure when it dealt with Article 69 on party closures in 2005 to limit the Chief Prosecutor's sole discretion to file a closure case. But the party did not deserve to be closed, nor did the 47% of the people who had voted for AKP.6. (C) Comment: The AKP appears determined to fight this head on. This is well-aligned with PM Erdogan's street-fighter instincts, and with the party's reaction to the April 27, 2007 e-coup. They are indeed playing with fire - but to be fair, the fire was lit under them first. If the package moves through parliament to referendum, it is hard to believe it would not garner a solid majority.Visit Ankara's Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turk eyAnkara 00000536 002 of 002Wilson
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000691  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  EUCOM PLEASE PASS TO POLAD  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2018 TAGS: PGOV PREL TUSUBJECT: IMPLICATIONS OF AKP CLOSURE CASE AND OUR PUBLIC POSTURE   Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROSS WILSON FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)  1. (c) Summary:  The closure case against Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is a blow to this country's future.  It reflects unresolved conflicts about the nature of Turkey, the state, the extent of popular democracy and the role of religion in society.  It also results from failed leadership by PM Erdogan over the nine months since his re-election victory last July.  The outcome is uncertain, but the crisis here must be viewed through the peculiar entity that is Turkish democracy -- imperfect, crabbed, but functional in its way.  US priorities are sustaining our ability to work with this country on mutual interests and supporting its democratic process in a broad sense, but we should avoid opining on the specifics of Turkish politics. This approach will respect the raucous and historic debate and politicking among Turks taking place now about the future of their country -- a vital process for democracy here to continue to mature.  End Summary.  Implications of the Closure Case --------------------------------  2. (c) Here is one way of looking at the AKP closure case. It is an attempted judicial coup, a Clausewitz-like extension of politics by legal means.  The indictment reads like a political tract.  It relies on newspaper clippings to justify excluding the party and 70-odd leaders from politics.  Among more bizarre bits of proof that the AKP intends to undo secularism are press reports of Secretary Powell praising the country,s "moderate Muslim" government and on its support for BMENA.  The propriety of banning parties is questionable in any democracy.  A ban based on a legally weak indictment of a party which nine months ago received 47 percent of the vote nationally and pluralities in 76 out of Turkey's 85 constituencies looks like a travesty for democratic values and the rule of law.  3. (c) Another way of looking at the case focuses on its consistency with democracy Turkish style.  The constitution and laws have long provided for banning politicians and dissolving parties, 26 of which have fallen victim.  The AKP had many years in office to change this and other questionable policies (like Article 301 on insulting Turkishness), but did not.  What looks to Western democracies like an unusual power in the judiciary to compromise the results of last July's election is one of Turkey's check and balancing mechanisms to protect the rights of the minority -- in this case secularists who feel threatened by the AKP.  4. (c) Some truth exists in both of these points of view. One clear thing is that PM Erdogan has stumbled badly.  One blunder was failing to make political bans more difficult when relevant legislation was amended several years ago.  As if dizzy with his own success, Erdogan failed to reassure the 53 percent who voted against his government last July that it would respect their interests too.  He failed to use his re-election mandate to continue EU-related reforms that were the most formidable tools for calming fears of Islamization and untrammeled majority rule.  He allowed himself to be goaded by the National Action Party (MHP) into putting the headscarf ban at the head of the reform queue.  For this short-term populist win, he sacrificed a larger constitutional reform package that would have significantly strengthened Turkey's democracy.  Effective, progressive governance that was the hallmark of early AKP years in office dried up in the 2007 election year, and no momentum returned after that.  These and other missteps exacerbated fears among many that Erdogan was going too far, too fast; that there were no effective constraints on the AKP (especially after the military's botched intervention last spring); and that fundamentalists might soon dominate the bureaucracy, judiciary, universities, etc., to change Turkey in dangerous and permanent ways.  5. (c) The closure case on its face is a set-back for democracy and stability in Turkey.  For many, especially the large swath of previously neglected voters who make up Turkey's emerging middle class and whom Erdogan's populism galvanized, the message is that Turkish democracy is too poorly developed to protect their interests against the traditional elite.  This message is even more threatening to  ANKARA 00000691  002 OF 003   those here who are still marginalized, especially Kurds. More broadly, the case looks like, and to some extent is, the revenge of an unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy against Erdogan and popular democracy.  Turks fear the Deep State and many, including strong critics of the AKP, are deeply uncomfortable with the judiciary's attempt to manipulate the power balance.  Associated turmoil also renders Turkey's vulnerable economy more uncertain at a time when global trends are already very negative; a big downturn would reinforce the sense of crisis here.  6. (c) Today, however, Turkey remains a secure, relatively stable emerging democracy.  There is no serious violence on the streets, and the economy has not crashed.  The closure case is not a catastrophe or the undoing of Turkey's peculiar and imperfect democracy, at least not now.  It is better seen as one among many moves in a very long chess game that all sides here, including Erdogan and the AKP, are adept at playing.  The mere fact of the indictment has already moderated the AKP's rhetoric and pushed it to emphasize effective governance and more consensual policies, especially EU accession-related reform.  It is only a slight exaggeration to say that this is the way Turkey's crabbed, military-drafted constitution intended the system to work. Figures ranging from former President Demirel to former parliamentary Speaker Cetin have remarked to us recently that Turkey has seen worse and will come through these difficulties all right.  At this point, at least, their reassurances seem more justified than not.  7. (c) How matters will play out in the short-medium term is uncertain.  -- A "victorious" AKP will still face intransigent opposition from one-third of the public, not to mention the courts, bureaucrats and generals.  -- A post-closure AKP will reorganize under a new name and almost certainly still have the votes among its un-banned MPs to form the next government alone.  People already talk about plausible, post-closure scenarios that involve bringing Erdogan and other potentially banned figures back into the picture.  -- Banishing the AKP will not change the reality that the main opposition parties are weak, divided and ill-equipped for 21st century politics.  Space may be created for a new centrist party, but credible leaders are not evident now, and the outlook for new elections that would propel them to prominence is uncertain.  The Islamist fringe in and outside the AKP could coalesce and become more radical; tarikats like the Gulenists may become more significant power centers than they are now.  Without broad constitutional reform to replace the current top-down state and better protect individual liberties, and without more consensus on the extent and limits of secularism in modern Turkey, this struggle is likely to continue.  8. (c) This episode will last at least six months and possibly a year or more.  In the meantime, Turkey's leadership will be distracted and cautious.  Unfortunately, this comes during a period of immense challenges to and opportunities for Turkish interests domestically and in the region that include the Kurdish issue, relations with Iraq and the KRG, energy security, Cyprus, Armenia, EU accession, terrorism, etc.  Policy creativity, never Turkey's strong suit, will diminish.  We also note that before the Constitutional Court decides the AKP's fate, it will likely rule on the headscarf amendments; reinstituting the ban at universities may actually calm matters and defuse the anti-AKP case.  The Court may also rule on the closure of the Kurdish nationalist Democratic Society Party (DTP); this could prove more explosive than the AKP case, given that DTP leaders and constituents accept much less of the constitutional/legal order here than the AKP mainstream.  Our Public Posture ------------------  9. (c) None of this changes the reality that Turkey is an extremely important ally in a dangerous region and that it  ANKARA 00000691  003 OF 003   is, despite many faults, more democratic and free than any other country in the Muslim world.  We should not stifle, through our intervention, what should fundamentally be a debate by Turks about the future of their country that is essential if its democratic institutions are to mature. Doing so would make this a US issue in ways harmful to our interests, our influence and to democratic values here.  We should stick to general principles, and let Turks sort out the details.  At some point, as matters develop, our intervention to head off a political meltdown here may be necessary, but that moment isn't now and may well never come.  10. (c) With this in mind, our public comments should take a positive and high road.  We should:  -- Make clear our strong support for Turkey, its democratic institutions and its commitment to democratic values and secular principles that define our alliance and partnership.  -- Urge Turkey's leaders and institutions to work for pragmatic solutions that reinforce stability and build consensus at a critical time for the country and in the region.  -- Emphasize support for Turkey's goal of accession to the EU and its need to legislate and implement comprehensive political and economic reforms that will sustain that goal and secure liberty and prosperity in the future.  -- Look forward to continuing to work with Turkey on behalf of common interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, the Balkans, on terrorism, on energy security, on the Cyprus problem and elsewhere in the region and the world.

S E C R E T BERLIN 000122  SIPDIS  NOFORN  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2018 TAGS: PGOV PREL GMSUBJECT: WELCOME TO BERLIN  Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION JOHN KOENIG FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)  ------------------------------------------ Electoral Fever Puts Pressure on Coalition ------------------------------------------  1. (C) NSA Hadley:  Mission Germany looks forward to welcoming you to Berlin January 31 to February 1.  Germany is currently consumed by the aftermath of bitterly fought state elections that took place on January 27 in Hesse and Lower Saxony.  They are being seen as barometers for next year's nationwide vote.  Although the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) won comfortably in Lower Saxony, the CDU suffered a major setback in Hesse, where CDU Minister-President Roland Koch ran a divisive election campaign that took his party from a commanding lead in early polls to a virtual tie with the Social Democratic party (SPD).  The country is also digesting the significance of the unexpected political gains by the (neo-Communist) Left Party and its entry into both Hesse and Lower Saxony parliaments. Over the next several weeks, state and national politicians will evaluate coalition options, none of which appear to please any of the major parties.  The CDU's poor showing in Hesse could energize its competitors and lead to further domestic partisanship, thereby complicating Chancellor Angela Merkel's goal of solidifying the political center in advance of the 2009 national elections.  On the other hand, the success of CDU Minister-President Christian Wulff's relatively low-key, centrist re-election campaign in Lower Saxony has been seen as a vindication of Merkel's domestic political strategy.  2. (C) The outcome of these two state elections, and that of the February 24 Hamburg elections, will likely reverberate in the day-to-day functioning of the CDU-SPD coalition. Already, Merkel's conservatives and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Social Democrats resemble the proverbial couple that hated each other but stayed together for the sake of the children:  the lack of any other viable coalition options is what sustains the partnership between the CDU/CSU and the SPD at this point.  On key priorities like Afghanistan and Kosovo (and on certain aspects of Iran), the gap between Merkel and Steinmeier is not so wide, and cooperation with the U.S. has not been harmed by domestic politics.  Differences are becoming more evident on some foreign policy issues however:  Steinmeier's January 17 meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Muallem, over strong opposition from the Chancellery, is just the latest example. Increasingly, Christoph Heusgen and the Chancellery's small staff are being blindsided by the Foreign Ministry on policy matters that are significant but outside the spotlight. Overall, we can expect Merkel's government to be more hamstrung by partisan and interagency rivalries between now and the fall of 2009 than was the case in its first two years in office.  ------------------------------------ Steinmeier's Evolving Political Role ------------------------------------  3. (C) Steinmeier, who came to office with a reputation as a technocrat, is increasingly a political rival to the Chancellor.  Like most of his predecessors, he has benefited from the visibility conferred on the Foreign Minister.  He has become the most popular SPD politician in Germany and the second most popular overall, trailing only Merkel.  He recently was named Vice Chancellor, was elected as one of three national deputy chairmen of the SPD, and announced he will run for a federal parliament seat in 2009.  Steinmeier is regarded, both within the SPD and among the general public, as an attractive possible chancellor candidate in 2009, should SPD Chairman Kurt Beck stumble.  4. (C) With Steinmeier's evolution from technocrat to political leader, he must cultivate much greater rank-and-file support within the SPD.  This is a particular challenge for him, because on domestic issues he is seen as relatively conservative.  He was a key architect of Gerhard Schroeder's economic reforms and stood by with a studied detachment as Kurt Beck and the SPD's left wing began to roll them back last fall.  This is all the more reason for Steinmeier to seek out foreign policy issues like arms control and disarmament on which he can strike chords that resonate with SPD voters (regardless of the shortcomings we find in these ideas).  Similarly, in policy toward Russia, the former Soviet republics, and the Middle East, Steinmeier misses no opportunity to evoke the legacy of Willy Brandt, elevating dialog and economic engagement above open expression of disagreement as tools of diplomacy.  5. (C) These internal factors amplify the tendency of Steinmeier and his Foreign Office to pursue initiatives not in harmony with the Chancellor's instincts or policy preferences.  Germany has a weak foreign policy coordination process and the German constitution grants broad autonomy to ministers.  Therefore, the ability of the Chancellor and her staff to rein in the Foreign Office is limited.  A result is that Germany does not always speak with a single, clear voice.  --------------------------------------------- IRAN: Importance of International Cooperation ---------------------------------------------  6. (S) Although Merkel and the Chancellery have more consistently toed our common firm line on Iran, both the Chancellery and the Foreign Office are firmly committed to securing a third UNSCR sanctions resolution as a basis for more biting EU autonomous measures.  MFA officials called the January 22 P5 1 Ministerial a success in demonstrating unity among the members, both by producing a new UNSC resolution text and by showing a unified strategic approach in dealing with Iran.  MFA officials have told us in private that EU autonomous sanctions would not be discussed at the January 28-29 GAERC.  In conversations prior to January 22, German officials have emphasized the importance of the broadest possible international coalition, and thus highly value efforts to keep all members of the P5-plus-1 on board, deploying this argument when approached about either unilateral or EU autonomous measures.  However, they point to pressures from their business community (as well as from the Finance and Economics Ministries) as constraints on adopting stronger unilateral action against the Iranian regime. Privately, senior officials in the Chancellery and Foreign Office have expressed frustration that the NIE has complicated international diplomatic efforts.  On December 4, FM Steinmeier said the NIE on Iran offered the chance "inject new momentum" into the nuclear negotiations and called on all sides not to squander this opportunity.  Merkel said publicly on January 15 that the NIE had slowed the momentum behind further UN sanctions; she simultaneously underscored the seriousness of Iran's nuclear activities and the need for international solidarity.  ---------------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: Need for Broader Deployment ----------------------------------------  7. (C) Encouraging greater German involvement in Afghanistan is a key priority of Mission Germany; we have made some progress, but the Germans remain very reluctant about deploying combat forces outside of the North.  In advance of the April NATO Summit, Germany will increase its involvement in the training of the Afghan National Army and will probably agree to take over responsibility for the 150-man quick reaction force (QRF) in the north.  We should welcome the QRF decision, because it would represent the first German ISAF contingent deployable on short notice (including possibly in exceptional and temporary circumstances outside the north), which would be a qualitatively new and significant step toward greater involvement in kinetic operations.  Secretary Gates' recent written request to Defense Minister Jung to deploy German Special Operations Forces (SOF) under ISAF in the south of Afghanistan is likely to be very controversial here, but may prove acceptable in the end if, in return, we were to offer Germany the option of ending its current offer of SOF for OEF.  Moving the German SOF commitment from OEF to ISAF would also have the benefit of allowing us to shift the considerable diplomatic resources and attention we devoted last fall to getting the German OEF mandate renewed to activities that may yield more practical benefits, such as pressing Germany to increase its contributions to ISAF.  8. (C) We should encourage greater German leadership in the EUPOL effort to train Afghanistan's civilian police force. EUPOL is led by German Juergen Scholz, and Germany contributes more police trainers than any other EU country, but the program has been slow to start and the planned ceiling of 195 EU police trainers is inadequate for the job. Furthermore, activities are not currently planned at the district level where the need is greatest.  Germany should be urged to accelerate the deployment of EU trainers to Afghanistan, increase the number of trainers, and broaden the geographic range of activities.  ------------------------ RUSSIA: Split Approaches ------------------------  9. (C) There are significant differences between the Chancellery and the Foreign Office on Russia, which invites Russian wedge-driving.  Merkel has never shied away from plain talk about disturbing trends inside Russia.  Steinmeier was the first foreign visitor to get a meeting with presidential candidate Medvedev after his nomination (a meeting with President Putin was thrown in as well).  Lately, the combination of Russian CFE suspension, backsliding on democracy, and intransigence on Kosovo has pushed even some in the SPD to offer criticism.  Still, the Foreign Ministry will likely continue to seek an unhelpful bridging role with Russia, in particular on CFE and other matters related to arms control.  The Chancellery can help constrain these impulses, but we will also need to keep up pressure among the Quad partners as well as from other key allies (e.g. Turkey and Norway) to make clear that German unilateral initiatives put transatlantic solidarity at risk.  ------------------------- KOSOVO: Close Cooperation -------------------------  10. (C) We discern very little daylight between the Chancellor and Steinmeier on Kosovo, and there is keen interest in working closely with the U.S. to resolve status and seal the EU's leadership role.  While the Bundestag will engage in intensive debate following an anticipated coordinated declaration of independence, we expect the multiparty consensus in favor of independence and the KFOR and ESDP missions to hold.  ------------------------------------- COUNTERTERRORISM: Building on Success -------------------------------------  11. (C) Your visit comes at a time when U.S.-German bilateral cooperation on security issues is as close as it has ever been.  The successful cooperation surrounding the September 4 arrests of three individuals planning large-scale attacks and the upcoming conclusion of a new bilateral agreement on fingerprint, DNA and other data sharing are the latest evidence of this trend.  Furthermore, no German senior official pushes as hard, or argues so publicly, for closer bilateral cooperation on security issues as Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.  Should the opportunity arise, you should inform German officials that we are eager to build on our successful record of counterterrorism cooperation and explore how we might work together to address threats such as European residents who seek terrorist training at overseas camps and become jihadists in Iraq or Afghanistan.  ---------------------------- ECONOMICS: Commitment to TEC ----------------------------  12. (C) Merkel highly values the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) -- a centerpiece of her 2007 EU presidency -- aimed at reducing regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade and investment.  She is concerned, however, about maintaining the momentum in the TEC and fears that the European Commission and future EU presidencies (including France) may lose enthusiasm for the project. German officials also worry that a changing U.S. Administration could derail what they regard as a highly successful new transatlantic economic instrument; we should emphasize our continued commitment to the TEC, and encourage the Germans to maintain a leading role in it.  The German economy is expected to grow at only 1.7 percent this year. Previous higher estimates were lowered due to rising oil prices, the strength of the Euro, slower U.S. growth, and continuing turmoil in financial markets.  German economists and business leaders are also worried about the possibility of a national minimum wage as well as increased labor union demands for wage increases, both of which could affect the economy adversely.  Merkel plans to highlight employment gains -- as opposed to minimum wages -- as the focus of her economic plan looking ahead to the 2009 national elections.  ----------------------------------- CLIMATE CHANGE: Aggressive Measures -----------------------------------  13. (C) Chancellor Merkel and the rest of Germany's political leadership remain serious about pursuing aggressive international measures to meet the challenges of global warming.  Merkel has made climate change a priority of her Chancellorship and enjoys the overwhelming domestic support on this.  Merkel's support for mandatory, targeted global limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an international cap-and-trade regime reflects a deep-seated belief that only drastic, concerted efforts on the part of the international community can slow -- and ultimately reverse -- the human contribution to global warming.  If anything, Steinmeier supports tougher standards.  While the Germans have been willing to consider alternative solutions, such as new technologies for clean coal and renewables, fundamental differences in our approaches to the issue of climate change remain, and could lead to more public disagreement in the future.  For example, while Germany will send a delegation to the January 30 Major Economies Meeting (MEM), the German Government remains skeptical about the value that the Major Economies Process (MEP) adds to the UNFCCC track. The Germans are particularly concerned about the need to avoid duplication of effort in the various other climate change-related forums, including the UNFCCC and the G-8. TIMKEN JR

BERLIN 313      B. 07 BERLIN 0674  Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission John Koenig for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- Summary -------  1. (C)  The German Grand Coalition will increasingly face tensions created by the need for the lead candidates to position themselves for the 2009 national electoral campaign.  Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier both remain highly popular.  Merkel, however, faces political risks if the economy turns for the worse.  In the second half of this year, as the Social Democratic Party (SPD) moves closer to a decision about its chancellor candidate, potential candidate Steinmeier will likely face scrutiny and criticism from his own party's left-wing.  It is too early to predict the likely coalition outcome in 2009 -- although Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) are likely to come out ahead, they may not have a better coalition option than continuing the current Grand Coalition with the SPD.  U.S. foreign policy is not likely to play a central role in the campaign leading up to Germany's national elections in fall 2009.  Improved U.S.-German relations under Merkel and German fascination with the vibrant democratic process in the U.S. primary elections have played significant roles in improving German attitudes towards the U.S., thereby dampening the likelihood that the SPD will use anti-American rhetoric to rally voters as former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did in 2002.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- Merkel's Possible Archilles Heel: The Economy ---------------------------------------------  2. (U) Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) remains highly popular among Germans, who view her as an effective leader with a strong international stature.  Her approval rating is 71 percent.  In large part due to Merkel's popularity, the CDU has held a commanding 8- to 14-point lead over the SPD in polls over the last year.  3. (C) Although Merkel's high popularity is expected to continue, she faces diffuse risks on economic issues.  CDU parliamentarians suggest that an economic downturn would be the principal threat to Merkel's high popularity  Economic forecasts currently favor Merkel, with projections of 1.6 to 1.8 percent growth for this year (though slightly lower for 2009), but with no real evidence of recession despite the global slowdown.  4. (C) Among CDU leaders there is a sense that the CDU may have peaked (perhaps too early) and that caution is the watchword.  Merkel, who campaigned in 2005 on a program of economic liberalization and watched a commanding lead in the polls nearly vanish during the campaign, appears to be moving toward the political center in an attempt to expand her base and consolidate centrist support that the SPD is losing because of its leftward shift.  She is demonstrating ever-greater focus on domestic policy and espousing popular middle class enticements such as pension increases, a longer duration of unemployment benefits for older workers, and enhancement of nursing care insurance.  While many consider this move to be politically smart, some on the CDU's right-wing have criticized the Chancellor for abandoning core CDU values.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Steinmeier Could Get Roughed Up by SPD's Left Wing --------------------------------------------- -----  5. (C) Social Democrats have speculated in recent months that SPD Chairman Kurt Beck will eventually defer to the much more popular Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as the party's eventual chancellor candidate (ref A).  SPD insiders consider this a 50-50 proposition.  Kurt Beck's recent victory in guiding competing factions of the SPD to agreement on privatization of the railway monopoly Deutsche Bahn may help shore up his position (septel).  It is uncertain whether Steinmeier would choose to accept the SPD nomination at a time when the SPD is hovering in the mid 20's in the polls and its electoral prospects seem poor.  Note: In any case, Steinmeier will run for political office, a federal parliament seat from Brandenburg City, for the first time in 2009.  End note.  6. (C) Steinmeier would face some detractors in his own  BERLIN 00000531  002 OF 002   party.  Deputy SPD Chair Andrea Nahles, the leading left-wing critic of Steinmeier's centrist approach, told Political M/C that she was unhappy that "the U.S. knows more about Steinmeier than I do," referring to Steinmeier's role as Chancellery Chief of Staff and Intelligence Coordinator under Gerhard Schroeder.  Nahles suggested strongly that the left wing of the SPD could portray Steinmeier as too close to the U.S. on intelligence-related issues, especially his role in the Murat Kurnaz affair (ref B), thereby damaging his candidacy.  7. (C) Nahles admitted, however, that the SPD likely would do better at the polls with Steinmeier as chancellor candidate (between 30 and 35 percent of the vote).  This would mean more SPD parliamentarians holding onto their seats -- a consideration that could have an effect on the SPD's choice. Nahles added that Steinmeier "has little experience in managing the party, but he's a fast learner."  ---------------------------------- Grand Coalition Fated to Continue? ----------------------------------  8. (C) Deputy CDU national chairman and Lower Saxony Minister-President Christian Wulff (CDU) told the DCM that another grand coalition is the most likely outcome in 2009 if the political landscape does not change significantly in the coming months.  The SPD's Nahles agrees.  While Merkel and the CDU still prefer to govern with the Free Democrats (FDP), the numbers may not suffice for a majority.  Although experiments such as the CDU-Greens coalition in Hamburg are enticing, replicating them at the national level remains difficult.  9. (C) Comment:  The CDU's fear of opening up its flanks to SPD attacks -- and the SPD's self-obsession during a period of turmoil in the party -- reveal a degree of caution on policy issues that is remarkable even by German standards. This is reflected in German caution on foreign policy issues of interest to us such as Afghanistan and Iran.  A particular USG concern is whether the SPD or others will try to employ anti-American rhetoric to curry voter support, much as former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did in 2002.  Even SPD left-wingers like Nahles tell us, however, that foreign policy is not as great a consideration for German voters as it was around the time of the Iraq war, and therefore will not likely be a decisive factor in next year's national elections.  It is also important to note that German attitudes towards the U.S. have improved over the past year due to our improved bilateral relations and German fascination with democracy on display in the U.S. primary elections.  The current improvement is evidenced by a recent Harris poll which showed a dramatic 21 percentage-point increase in the number of Germans who regard the U.S. as a trustworthy partner.  Also, the German federal election campaign will occur during what is expected here to be an extended popular "honeymoon" for the new U.S. administration.  Consequently, German politicians might perceive less political advantage in a critical stance toward the U.S.  End comment. TIMKEN JR
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CAIRO 001067  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ELA, H  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2018 TAGS: PREL PGOV ECON EGSUBJECT: CODEL BAIRD MEETS WITH EGYPTIAN LEADERS ON MARGINS OF WEF  Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) Summary: Codel Baird discussed Egyptian and regional issues with Egypt's political and business leaders on the margins of the May 18 - 20 World Economic Forum (WEF) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.  President Mubarak, Intelligence Chief Omar Soliman, and presidential son Gamal Mubarak focused on the need for deep engagement to resolve the Israeli/Palestinian crisis and to hinder Iran's growing influence in the region.  On Iraq, Mubarak said "you cannot leave" but advised strengthening the military and allowing a "fair" dictator to come to power via a coup.  "Forget democracy," he opined, "the Iraqis are too tough by nature."  On the economic side, Egypt's business leaders regretted the lack of a U.S.-Egypt free trade agreement and asked the U.S. to push Egypt harder on good governance and democratic reform.  Codel Baird consisted of Representatives Brian Baird (D-WA), Christopher Shays (R-CT), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), and Jim Cooper (D-TN); Representative Jane Harman (D-CA) joined the codel briefly on May 18.  End summary.  President Mubarak -----------------  2. (C) The codel began by thanking Mubarak for his positive leadership on regional issues.  Mubarak said that he had advised Vice President Cheney and other U.S. officials not to invade Iraq and that "no one listened," but that now "it would be a mistake" to withdraw forces immediately because it would further open the door for Iran.  Asked about U.S.-Egypt relations, Mubarak confirmed that "we have very good relations with the U.S.," but "your administration is not well-informed."  However, "I am patient by nature," he said, in apparent reference to U.S. criticisms over human rights and democratization.   Congressman Shays encouraged Mubarak to engage with Iraq as much as possible and asked if Egypt would send an ambassador, to which Mubarak replied "no, I cannot do it.  When there is stability I am willing, but I cannot force civilians to go."  3. (C) Asked about Egypt's reaction if Iran developed nuclear weapons capability, Mubarak said that none will accept a nuclear Iran, "we are all terrified."  Mubarak said that when he spoke with former Iranian President Khatami he told him to tell current President Ahmedinejad "not to provoke the Americans" on the nuclear issue so that the U.S. is not forced to strike.  Mubarak said that Egypt might be forced to begin its own nuclear weapons program if Iran succeeds in those efforts.  4. (C) Asked about whether the U.S. should set a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq, Mubarak said "you cannot leave" because "you would leave Iran in control."  Mubarak explained his recipe for a way forward: "strengthen the armed forces, relax your hold, and then you will have a coup.  Then we will have a dictator, but a fair one.  Forget democracy, the Iraqis are by their nature too tough."  Omar Soliman ------------  5. (C) Egyptian General Intelligence Service (EGIS) chief Omar Soliman gave the codel an expansive evaluation of the key issues in the region.  He focused on Iran's growing influence in Iraq, with Hamas, with Hizballah in Lebanon, and with Shia communities in the Gulf.  To solve regional problems Egypt is working on three tracks - Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq.  6. (C) Egypt hopes to achieve something soon on the Palestinian track, he said, but neither side is ready to stop the vicious circle of violence, although most on both sides want "quiet."  Soliman's job now, he said, is to bridge the gaps on specific issues like border crossings, prisoner exchange, and bringing Hamas and the PA back together.  He hoped to see an agreement on borders for a Palestinian state by the end of 2008, and noted that as a practical matter very few Palestinian refugees would seek right of return.  7. (C) On Lebanon, speaking a week before the Doha agreement was penned, Soliman said the three problems are Syria's large influence, lack of power of the majority over militia forces, and weak Arab support for the government.  Syria is seeking a deal with Israel and the U.S. over returning the Golan and canceling the Hariri tribunal to lessen its meddling and Lebanon needs a strong, nationalist army.  Soliman bemoaned that the Arab states have too poor relations with Syria to  CAIRO 00001067  002 OF 002   push them effectively.  8. (C) On Iraq, Egypt meets regularly with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Turkey to discuss reducing Iranian influence.  The GOI must understand it has support from the Arabs and the U.S., not just Iran, he said.  Soliman advocated making Iran suffer economically to be "too busy with its people" to make problems in Iraq.  Reducing Iranian influence will help the Iraqi government become one, and not a competition between Sunni and Shi'a. he said.  9. (C) Asked about the consequences of any U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear capabilities, Soliman said such an attack would not destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities and would only unite Iranians with their leadership and against the U.S.  He repeated the need to make Iran "busy with its people" by effective sanctions, citing the successful example of Libya. Asked about Sudan, he said that Egypt is still working to make north-south unity attractive, and to encourage talks between the GOS and rebels and between Bashir and Deby.  10. (C) Asked what it means when Arabs say that the U.S. "should listen to us," Soliman gave the example that President Mubarak warned Vice President Cheney about the consequences of the U.S. invading Iraq.  Additionally, "your unilateral positions on economic aid are difficult." However, Soliman emphasized that Egypt is keen to continue to have a "very close" relationship with the U.S.  Gamal Mubarak -------------  11. (C) Gamal opined that the "battle lines are clearer for Egypt than ever before" on regional issues.  The region "will not realize its full potential as long as geopolitical problems continue," he said.  With the Israeli/Palestinian problem in particular, "we are racing against time."  Gamal advocated close engagement by the U.S., Egypt, and other countries (NFI) in order to make practical improvements in the every day lives of Palestinians and develop a framework for a final deal, with borders as the key issue.  Other regional issues such as Iran and Lebanon are "much more complicated," he said; "the picture is not that rosy."  12. (C) Representative Baird raised the issue of USAID efforts to assist conservation of Red Sea reefs, which Gamal agreed was an important issue.  Representative Shays asked Gamal's opinion of Syria President Bashar Al Assad, to which Gamal replied that "he understands the world better than his father," but that he is worried that opening up politically or economically could result in a loss of control.  13. (C) Representative Harman asked for Egypt to do more to fight smuggling to Gaza through tunnels, perhaps by setting up roadblocks a few miles before the border to intercept contraband.  Gamal said that the border is a "shared concern" and Egypt is doing what it can to address smuggling.  14. (C) Representative Fortenberry asked about how to counter a developing Iranian nuclear program.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as Jordan, are the "heavyweights" that can counter Iran, Gamal said, but he advocated movement on the Israeli/Palestinian track to remove a prime issue that Iran can use as a pretext.  American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt -------------------------------------  15. (SBU) The AmCham group led by President Omar Mohanna (Suez Cement) lamented that the lack of a U.S.-Egypt FTA continues to push Egypt's trade towards Europe and away from the U.S.  They praised the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) program and advocated expanding it to upper Egypt, though they acknowledged that increasing Egyptian textile exports to the U.S. would be a sensitive issue in the U.S. textile lobby.  Karim Ramadan (Microsoft) praised the historic role of USAID in Egypt and asked that it continue with a focus on education and health, areas in particular need of development in Egypt. SCOBEY

(C) Summary: On July 2, Senator Kerry and the Ambassador discussed regional developments with President Hosni Mubarak, including Zimbabwe, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, and Israel-Palestine. Mubarak said that Egypt was working to find a solution in Sudan, but preferred to do so "quietly."  Mubarak warned against a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.  While he called Iranians "liars" and said they sponsor terrorism, he opined that no Arab state would join the U.S. in a formal defense alliance against Iran for fear of retaliation. Mubarak expressed frustration with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and was particularly disparaging about the lack of Palestinian unity.  End summary.  ------------------- AU "Soft" on Mugabe -------------------  2. (C) In a 60-minute meeting with President Mubarak in Sharm El-Sheikh, Senator Kerry began by asking for Mubarak's views on the discussions at the African Union Summit, which had concluded in Sharm El-Sheikh the previous day. Mubarak said he had been at the Summit until late in the evening and was tired. He reported that some member states had condemned Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, while others told him to form a national unity government and find a role for the opposition parties. Mubarak said he couldn't prevent Mugabe from attending the conference in Egypt because Zimbabwe is a member of the African Union. He said the British were behind this "big fuss" and that the pressure from other African leaders was "sufficiently soft that Mugabe can do what he wants."  ------------------------------- Sudan:  Quiet Diplomacy Is Best -------------------------------  3. (C) In response to Senator Kerry's query about the situation in Sudan, Mubarak said the issue was not discussed publicly at the AU summit. He also said "this issue could have been worked out" if it were not debated so publicly because "two tribes always work things out." Mubarak noted Egypt's attempts to "try and help the (Sudanese) people" through the Egyptian hospital in Sudan and the efforts of EGIS Director Omar Suleiman to advise on North-South negotiations.  ------------------------------ Iraq:  Don't Pull Out Too Soon ------------------------------  4. (C) Turning to Iraq, Senator Kerry asked Mubarak if he had changed his opinion of Prime Minister Al Maliki after Iraq's successful stabilization efforts in Basra and Sadr City. Mubarak said he "I am not critical. He came to Cairo.  I gave him my phone number but he hasn't called us." He noted that Egypt offered to host and train Iraqi forces, but that the offer had not been acted upon by the Iraqis.  He said the U.S. "cannot withdraw until you strengthen the armed forces and police. Until then you have to stay."  ------------------- Beware The Iranians -------------------  5. (C) Mubarak's top concern for the stability of Iraq and the region is Iran. He believes that "as a result of the invasion of Iraq, Iran is spreading everywhere." He urged the U.S. to be wary of what Iran says. "They are big, fat liars and justify their lies because they believe it is for a higher purpose." He said he believes this opinion is shared by other leaders in the region. Nonetheless, he opined that no Arab state will join the U.S. in a defense relationship vis-a-vis Iran out of fear of "sabotage and Iranian terrorism." He said Iran's sponsorship of terrorism is "well-known but I cannot say it publicly. It would create a dangerous situation." Mubarak said that sanctions are the best hope for containing Iran, but Arab states won't dare to endorse them.  ----------------------------------- Not Optimistic on The Peace Process -----------------------------------  6. (C) On the Middle East Peace Process, Mubarak said he sees no progress between Syria and Israel and doesn't expect any progress between Israel and the PA leadership. He said that "Palestinians are quarrelling" and Hamas and other factions will reject any agreement made by Abu Mazen. Senator Kerry  CAIRO 00001637  002 OF 002   suggested the parties appeared to be close in some areas. In response, Mubarak reiterated he doesn't believe the many Palestinian factions will reach agreement and, thus, they only serve to undermine Abu Mazen's efforts.  7.

(S) Summary.  EGIS Chief Omar Soliman told Ambassador and a visiting Codel led by Senator George Voinovich December 31 that he is optimistic progress will be made on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.  However, Soliman was concerned with continuing Israeli criticism of Egyptian anti-smuggling efforts.  He was worried that the Egyptians would not be able to work out an arrangement with the Israelis for Hajj pilgrims to return to Gaza.  On Iran, Soliman said that the USG's release of the National Intelligence Estimate had altered the calculus through which Arab states are interacting with Iran.  On Iraq argued that the Iraqi government needed to amend its constitution and that Prime Minister Malaki should not deal with the Iraqi people in a "sectarian way."  End summary.  2. (S) Soliman led off the New Year's Eve meeting by telling the Codel that the region is at a special, critical juncture.  Egypt is America's partner.  Sometimes we have our differences.  But Egypt will continue to provide the USG with its knowledge and expertise on the critical regional issues, such as Lebanon and Iraq.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the core issue; Soliman contended a peaceful resolution would be a "big blow" to terrorist organizations that use the conflict as a pretext.  For this reason, President Mubarak is committed to ending the Israeli-Arab "stalemate."  3. (S) Soliman applauded the Administration's efforts, commenting that Annapolis had given hope and begun a process.  The timing is right for progress based on four factors. First, the PA leadership is moderate and willing to negotiate.  Second, Hamas is isolated and politically cut off in Gaza.  Third, the Israelis are ready for peace; Soliman assessed that the GOI coalition is broad and strong, and larger than Rabin's coalition of the mid-nineties.  Fourth, Arab states are ready to see an end to "the struggle."  4. (S) Soliman stressed that Egypt stands ready to help the U.S. effort.  The GOE knows both the Palestinians and the Israelis, and knows the obstacles to peace.  Soliman recommended two steps be taken. First, both the Israelis and Palestinians must be pressed hard to sign an agreement, which the U.S. and international community could endorse, to be implemented at the proper time.  Second, the U.S. should insist that "phase one" of the Roadmap should be completed before the end of 2008.  5. (S) Israeli-Palestinian Conflict:  Soliman opined that the Palestinian Authority was ready to sign an agreement, but that establishment of a state may take between 1-3 years. While Hamas is isolated politically and unable to stop an Israeli-PA agreement, it remains entrenched in Gaza, and it was unclear to Soliman how long that would last.  At one point in the discussion, Soliman seemed to imply Hamas may remain in control of Gaza for more than a year; at another juncture, he told Senator Voinovich that if negotiations proceeded briskly, Hamas may be forced to cede power in Gaza in 3-4 months.  The bottom line for Hamas, according to Soliman, is that they must be forced to choose between remaining a resistance movement or joining the political process.  They cannot have it both ways, he said.  6. (S) Palestinian training: Soliman reiterated GOE willingness to train and support Palestinian security forces.  He claimed that the GOE had training facilities ready, but that he was waiting for an answer from U.S. Security Coordinator General Keith Dayton.  (Note: We have advised Soliman that initial training of Palestinian security forces will take place in Jordan, and that we will revisit the option of training in Egypt this spring.  End note).  He continued that the GOE would keep pressure on Hamas but will maintain "low-level" contacts with Hamas.  Egypt, he said, wants Hamas isolated.  The Qassam rocket attacks must stop. When they do stop, the GOE will ask Israel to "meet quiet with quiet."  7. (S)  Border issues:  Senator Voinovich asked Soliman why the Israelis continue to report problems with Egypt's anti-smuggling efforts.  Soliman said that the Israelis do not complain to him directly, and that GOI-GOE cooperation and exchange of information continues.  He was at a loss as to why Israeli politicians continue to criticize Egypt publicly.  The GOE would like the USG to be included in the GOI-GOE LAWIO discussions, but the Israelis continue to object.  "They don't want a witness in the room," Soliman said.  Nevertheless, Soliman was willing to turn the page. "We have a short time to reach peace.  We need it.  We need to wake up in the morning with no news of terrorism, no explosions, and no news of more deaths.  We want everyone happy.  That is the Egyptian dream."  8. (S) Syria:  Congressman Turner asked if Iran and/or Syria might be play a spoiler role.  Soliman answered that Syria wants desperately to halt the United Nations special tribunal on the Hariri assassination.  At the same time, the SARG is ready to negotiate with the Israelis, and Soliman believed that the GOI also is ready.  Syria, Soliman said, can be induced to play a constructive role but added that there are no guarantees, however, on Syrian performance.  9. (S) NIE:  Regarding the USG's National Intelligence Estimate of Iran's nuclear program, Soliman was concerned that many in the Arab world were recalculating their position vis a vis Iran based on an assumption that the NIE represented a USG policy shift.  Soliman said the Egyptians are working to correct this misimpression among Arab states. "We tell the Arab world:  Don't be happy with the NIE and don't warm up to Iran. We know that the United States will never allow Iran to have a nuclear bomb."  10. (S) Iran:  Soliman said that Iran remains a significant threat to Egypt.  It continues to influence Shiaa in Iraq and the Gulf.  Iran is supporting Jihad and spoiling peace, and has supported extremists in Egypt previously.  If they were to support the Muslim Brotherhood this would make them "our enemy," he said.  The GOE continues to press the Iranian regime to turn over extremists given "safe harbor" in Iran. This issue, he said, will remain an obstacle to improving Egyptian-Iranian relations.  (Soliman met with Iranian former nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani earlier in the week. Larijani was in Egypt on a week-long "private visit."  11. (S) Iraq: Soliman said he remains concerned that the Maliki government in Iraq is not representing all Iraqis (i.e. the Sunni population).  The GOE has urged Maliki not to deal with the Iraqi people in a sectarian way, and to amend to constitution to allow greater Sunni representation.  In addition, the Iraqi government must remove militias from the ranks of the army and police.  In the long run, Soliman did not think that the decrease in violence would be sustainable absent these two steps.  In addition, Iranian influence is problematic.  Soliman said that the GOE had worked to reconcile 21 clans and tribes in Iraq, with good results, and that this kind of efforts had to continue.  He assessed that both Sistani and Sadr were practical men, and able to be dealt with.  12. (U) Delegation composition:  Senator George Voinovich (R-OH) Congressman Mike Turner (R-OH) Congressman Steve Pearce (R-NM) Congressman Rob Bishop (R-UT) Congressman Phil Gingrey (R-GA)  13.

(SBU) Newly-elected Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer(Christian Social Union - CSU) elevated youthful, female, and freshfaces in the presentation of his surprising cabinet choices onOctober 30. In a canny move, he also chose 36-year-old Bundestagmember Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as CSU Secretary General. Thismakes zu Guttenberg effectively the spokesman, televisionpersonality, and advisor to the CSU leadership. He is also a Berlinplayer, serving as the CSU's main foreign policy expert and memberof the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee. (Note: While zuGuttenberg likely will choose to retain his Bundestag seat, hisoffice at CSU headquarters in Munich told us said it is not clearwhether he will remain on the Foreign Affairs Committee or switch toa committee oriented toward domestic affairs. End note.)Seehofer's choice underlines the CSU's claim to be more than just aregional party, particularly in view of the 2009 European Parliamentand federal elections. The group (para 4 below) needs to appeal toskeptical citizenry if the CSU hopes to do better in European andBundestag elections in 2009.2. (SBU) Complicating Seehofer's and the new cabinet's task is thenew presence of three members of the coalition member FreeDemocratic Party (FDP) (one is a State Secretary), who will maketheir own attempts to strike a favorable profile. In all, Seehoferreplaced sixteen of the eighteen cabinet positions with eightnewcomers. He could be accused of ageism since he dismissed all CSUcabinet members over 60 years old, thus drastically reducing thegovernment's age average below 50. Five cabinet members are women.Notably, the Landtag also elected its first female President, the64-year-old Barbara Stamm.3. (SBU) The new Bavarian cabinet will consist of the followingmembers, all CSU unless otherwise noted as FDP:-Minister President: Horst Seehofer, 59, Upper Bavaria, elected onOctober 27 (new);-Minister of Economics and Deputy Minister President: Martin Zeil(FDP), 52, Upper Bavaria (new);--MOE State Secretary: Katja Hessel (FDP), 36, Middle Franconia(new);-Minister of Interior: Joachim Herrmann, 52, Middle Franconia (theincumbent);-MOI State Secretary: Bernd Weiss, 40, Lower Franconia (new);-Minister for Labor and Social Affairs: Christine Haderthauer, 47,Upper Bavaria (new, formerly General Secretary of the CSU);--State Secretary: Markus Sackmann, 47, Upper Palatinate (new);-Minister at the Bavarian State Chancery: Siegfried Schneider, 52,Upper Bavaria (new);-Minister for European and Federal Affairs: Emilia Mueller, 56,Upper Palatinate (new);-Minister of Finance: Georg Fahrenschon, 40, Upper Bavaria (new);--MOF State Secretary: Franz Josef Pschierer, 52, Suabia (new);-Minister of Environment: Markus Soeder, 41, Middle Franconia(new);--MOEnv State Secretary: Melanie Huml, 33, Upper Franconia (new);-Minister of Agriculture: Helmut Brunner, 54, Lower Bavaria (new);-Minister of Justice: Dr. Beate Merk, 51, Suabia;-Minister of Science: Dr. Wolfgang Heubisch (FDP), 62, Upper Bavaria(new);-Minister of Culture and Education: Ludwig Spaenle, 47, UpperBavaria;--MOC State Secretary: Dr. Marcel Huber, 50, Upper Bavaria(new).(NOTE: Diplopedia has biographies on German political figures at:xxxxx and then search for GermanyBiographies.4. (SBU) Comment: Seehofer's cabinet is mainly remarkable for itsyouthful representation. We view the surprise nomination ofKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Secretary General as a clever move,particularly in view of the CSU's claim of being more than just aregional Bavarian party. Zu Guttenberg is a foreign policy expert,a transatlanticist and a close and well-known friend to the UnitedStates and Mission Germany.5.

MUNICH 351Classified By: Consul General Eric Nelson for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).SUMMARY -------1. (SBU) The Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU),dangerously weakened, is attempting to sharpen its profileamong Bavarian and national voters, by pursuing an aggressiveeconomic campaign that diverges from that of its sisterparty, Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats. The CSU isfinding plenty of opportunities to profile itself locally andnationally in addressing the challenges presented by thefinancial crisis. For one, Bavarian Minister PresidentSeehofer has threatened to boycott the January 5 "coalitionsummit" if Chancellor Merkel does not bend to the CSU'srecipe for responding to Germany's economic downturn througha tax reform proposal. Merkel needs a strong CSU showing inBavaria to achieve her goal of a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition afterthe 2009 national elections, but the CSU's strategy couldbuild tensions between the sister parties. How the CDU-CSUdivisions play out could influence national economic policyas well as how the upcoming campaign will shape up in themonths to come. End Summary.CSU SALTING THE CDU'S SOUP --------------------------2. (SBU) The CSU still holds Chancellor Merkel partlyresponsible for the CSU's poor outcome in the September 2008state elections. Merkel failed to support the CSU, forexample, on the tax deductibility of commuting costs, one ofthe CSU's key issues that the CDU had rejected until thelatest ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court that agreedwith the position of the CSU. Erwin Huber, former head ofthe CSU, said "the CDU should have listened to us instead ofFinance Minister Steinbrueck (SPD) on this sensitive issue."3. (C) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Secretary General of theCSU (PROTECT), told the Consul General on December 17 thatthe CSU is "heating up the debate" and will meet on January 4"to map out a strategy for the 2009 election campaign,"adding, "We want to be more like the party was under EdmundStoiber and Franz Josef Straus (both legendary formerMinister Presidents)." Or, as Hartmut Kotschyk (CSU partywhip in the Bundestag) put it to the P/E Chief recently, "Wewant to be the salt in their soup."4. (C) Zu Guttenberg and Koschyk reviewed possibleapproaches the CSU would take with its platform for 2009.a) Taking a hard line against EU membership not only forTurkey but also for Ukraine. The CSU could lump Turkey andUkraine together so neither country could feel singled outfor bad treatment. The CSU's new foreign policy spokeswomanin the Bundestag, Dorothee Baer, told Berlin PolMC that thiswould be a focus of the CSU's campaign for EuropeanParliament elections in June 2009.b) Insisting on more EU "subsidiarity." The CSU wants morerespect for national and regional and local prerogatives ingovernance and administrative control, such as allowingrestrictions on bioengineered seeds.c) Strengthening and refocusing the economy. The CSU wantsa renewed commitment to human over financial capital as a wayto address what Koschyk called "a believability problem amongthe rank and file Germans for the market economy." ZuGuttenberg complained that "Merkel was not being assertiveenough on the economy," echoing recent statements by HorstSeehofer, Bavarian Minister President (CSU). However, healso admitted that he could understand her approach since hefound her to be "personally conservative" and "not one to bein the front on bold initiatives." He expected she was"trying to maintain her options in 2009" as well as "tryingto stay close to the coalition Social Democratic Party (SPD)."BAVARIA'S PRESIDENT CUTTING A MEAN FIGURE -----------------------------------------5. (SBU) Finally, MP Seehofer has criticized the CDU inpublic around Bavaria, in Berlin, and in the media, whichreported that CDU leaders viewed his actions as"unpredictable" because he made proposals that strayed fromMUNICH 00000423 002 of 002the coalition's party line. He criticized the Chancellor'seconomic course, for example, arguing that Germany needed alarger and more meaningful program than the Chancellor hadsupported. Seehofer preserved the independence of Bavariancontrol over the Bayerische Landesbank (BayernLB) byrejecting the Federal rescue package in an attempt to useonly Bavarian resources. And, he pushed for immediate taxdeductions, not just some time after the election.COMMENT: CREATING INDIVIDUALITY WITHOUT KILLING EACH OTHER --------------------------------------------- -------------6. (C) Chancellor Merkel and the CDU need a strong andcooperative Bavarian CSU partner in order to win the 2009Bundestag election. Down in Bavaria, the CSU must getstronger, too, and is fighting for its uniqueness as aregional party with national and international credentials.Although the ultimate goals are compatible, the CSUnecessarily must set itself apart from the CDU to proveitself to skeptical locals who knocked the CSU off its highhorse in the last election. The challenge for both partiesis to allow the CSU to profile itself without killing therelationship, and each other's chances, with an overlyaggressive factional campaign.7.

FALLON'S MEETING WITH SULTAN QABOOS  Classified By: Ambassador Gary A. Grappo for Reasons 1.4 (b, d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.  (C) Sultan Qaboos discussed both domestic and regional issues during his February 19 meeting with Admiral William J. Fallon, CENTCOM Commander.  On the domestic front, the Sultan described his desire to empower the government to be more responsive to citizen concerns.  Seeking to strengthen the role of Omani women, the Sultan plans to convene a conference in 2009 designed to increase the participation and leadership of women in all aspects of Omani society.  Sultan Qaboos also shared plans for continued infrastructure development in Oman and described efforts underway to obtain more natural gas. On Iraq, the Sultan advised against a premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and stated that more regional assistance would be forthcoming if Iraqis would "come together" to take charge of, and invest in, their own country.  Sultan Qaboos shared U.S. concerns about Iranian meddling in Iraq and elsewhere, but contended that Tehran knew confrontation with the U.S. was not in its interest.  Iran's "charm offensive" in the GCC had succeeded in lessening suspicions of some officials about the true intentions of Iranian policies.  End Summary.  2.  (C) CENTCOM Commander Admiral Fallon, accompanied by the Ambassador, met February 19 with Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id for approximately 2 hours at one of the Sultan's castles -- Husn al Shumugh -- in the interior of Oman.  (Note:  The Sultan was outside of Muscat on his annual 4-6 week "meet the people tour" during which he visits selected sites outside the capital.  End Note.)  The Sultan appeared in good health and was cheerful, although he commented that his role as ruler of Oman was demanding and did not allow him time to do all the things he wanted to do, such as reading more books.  "My office is wherever I am," he stated, noting that he constantly had to attend to paperwork and urgent requests from his staff, among other tasks.  The Sultan added that despite his busy schedule, he always made time to "watch the news," though he did not elaborate on his preferred media outlet.  ------------------- CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQ -------------------  3.  (C) The Sultan expressed concern over a premature withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.  Recognizing recent improvements in the security situation, he counseled that American troops should only leave "when the time is right." He stressed that Iraqis had to "take charge" of the fate of their country, but questioned whether the different factions would be able to "come together" to accomplish this.  He pointedly asked the Admiral, "Do you really think Prime Minister Maliki and his government are capable of pulling the country together?"  The Sultan did not directly respond to Admiral Fallon's comment on the need for assistance and investment for Iraq from elsewhere in the region.  Instead, he stated that if the Iraqi people helped themselves and invested in their own country, others would follow suit.  4.  (C) The Sultan appeared to follow events in Iraq closely.  He commented, for example, that the Kurds had apparently "come out well" in recent central government talks on budget issues, and asked about the status of electricity production in Iraq.  The Sultan seemed to take a particular interest in Admiral Fallon's discussion of Iraqi Shia leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, including the status of Hakim's health and his possible successors.  -------------------------- INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT --------------------------  5.  (C) In addition to emphasizing the need for outside investment in Iraq, Admiral Fallon highlighted the importance of assistance from regional states for infrastructure development in Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations. Again the Sultan sidestepped the issue and shifted the conversation to the critical role of roads and highways in economic development.  He then mentioned infrastructure projects for Oman currently under consideration, including construction of a new dam and a freight rail line from the northern port of Sohar to the planned port in Duqm.  The Sultan hoped that the southern port of Salalah could be linked by rail to Muscat and, eventually, to other GCC states.  MUSCAT 00000174  002 OF 003    -------------- IRANIAN ISSUES --------------  6.  (C) The Sultan commented that the Iranians are "not fools," and claimed that Tehran realized there are "certain lines it cannot cross" (i.e., direct confrontation with the U.S.).  Regarding GCC relations with the Iranian government, he stated, "Iran is a big country with muscles and we must deal with it."  He continued that Iran's "charm offensive" in the region had achieved a degree of success as some GCC authorities (he did not mention names) were now less suspicious of Iranian intentions.  The Sultan added, laughing, that "I must say that as long as (the U.S.) is on the horizon, we have nothing to fear."  7.  (C) Responding to Admiral Fallon's frustration with Iranian interference in Iraq, the Sultan remarked that Iranian meddling abroad was "almost a game" to the regime in Tehran, and said that Iran's leaders would have to stop this practice if Iran wanted to "join the world as a noble country."  The Sultan hoped that Iraqi leaders would clearly tell and convince Iranian President Ahmadinejad during his upcoming visit to Iraq to cease Iran's unhelpful interference in their internal affairs.  On the possibility that Iran is waiting out the President's final term before re-assessing its strategy, the Sultan said that Tehran should realize that it has to deal with the U.S. as a country, and not just the current administration.  ------------------ THE SEARCH FOR GAS ------------------  8.  (C) After noting Iranian dependence on imports of refined fuel, the Sultan described Oman's efforts to obtain more natural gas to fuel growing domestic power needs and large-scale industrial projects.  Oman had committed too much of its limited gas production to long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) export contracts.  As a result, the government was trying to boost production by taking smaller and less productive gas fields away from Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) -- 60% owned by the government and 34% owned by Royal Dutch Shell -- and awarding them to outside companies such as British Gas and BP.  The Sultan claimed these firms were in a better position to increase productivity in these fields, and pointed to the progress of U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Company in raising oil production in former PDO concession areas, such as Mukhaizna.  9.  (C) Looking offshore, the Sultan said he hoped that new gas fields would be found in the Gulf of Oman to help ease the country's natural gas shortage.  India's Reliance Industries was currently exploring a deepwater oil and gas block in this body of water, but had made no significant discoveries yet.  Qatar would begin supplying gas to Oman by 2013, the Sultan noted, but not in quantities sufficient to meet outstanding needs.  He added that Oman was still supplying limited gas from Musandam to Ras al-Khaimah in the UAE due to an agreement he made with its emir -- and which the Sultan felt he could not break -- well before Oman was squeezed for this resource.  --------------------------- THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION ---------------------------  10.  (C) Sultan Qaboos shared that he placed a great deal of importance on education, and noted that a study of history provided the context needed to better understand present trends and events.  Regarding claims that some rulers in the region wanted to keep their people uneducated in order to more easily control them, the Sultan explained that this strategy could easily backfire as it also left the populace more susceptible to influence by extremists, such as the Muslim Brotherhood.  Former Egyptian president and pan-Arabist leader Gamal Abdal Nasser, the Sultan said, had "set the region back" by being "anti-everything" and engaging in vitriolic rhetoric designed to keep the masses ignorant.  ----------------------------------- EMPOWERING THE GOVERNMENT AND WOMEN -----------------------------------  11.  (C) On domestic politics, the Sultan announced that he would hold the first-ever combined meeting of his Cabinet of Ministers and the Majlis al-Shura (the directly elected lower  MUSCAT 00000174  003 OF 003   house of Oman's bicameral advisory body) on February 26.  By meeting together, the Sultan hoped that the Cabinet and the Majlis would learn how to cooperate better and jointly focus on important issues.  He commented that both bodies also needed to "demonstrate more leadership" and avoid past foot-dragging on promises made to the populace.  "People need to see the results of decisions," the Sultan stated.  12.  (C) Letting Admiral Fallon and the Ambassador in on a "secret," the Sultan confided that he planned to call for a conference of all "notable women" in Oman in 2009 in a bid to encourage Omani women to expand their participation and leadership in different aspects of Omani society.  Minister of Social Development, Dr. Sharifa bint Khalfan al-Yahyaiya (one of Oman's three female cabinet ministers) will chair the meeting on the Sultan's behalf.  Lamenting that no women won seats in the October 2007 election for the Majlis al-Shura, Sultan Qaboos observed that Omani women were stuck in tradition and needed to be empowered to "take more charge" and to be "less shy."  "Some customs (regarding women)," he added, "shouldn't be kept."  Nevertheless, gradual change is occurring in Oman, the Sultan asserted.  His philosophy was to "let it happen," rather than hold it up to public debate, as the latter course of action often led to factional fighting, internal strife, and other ills.  --------------------------------------------- A RECURRENT THEME: MORE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT ---------------------------------------------  13.  (C) In concluding the meeting, Sultan Qaboos returned to his goal of improving the responsiveness of the Omani government to citizen concerns.  He stated that he would be pressing "harder" on his ministers to engage in more and better public relations efforts before the Omani police and to effectively enforce their decisions so that the people could see the benefits of announced actions.  Giving one particular example, the Sultan said that rather than simply announce a new development project, the government should explain the downstream employment opportunities the project would generate for Omani citizens.  Effective cooperation between ministries and the Majlis Oman was also needed to strengthen the civil institutional framework in Oman, the Sultan added.  ------- COMMENT -------  14.  (S/NF) In discussing his desire for operational change in the senior government ranks, the Sultan twice implied (but did not directly state) that such change was needed to prepare the country for his eventual departure from power. The Sultan's comments indicated that he may feel the government is too dependent on his authority and should be empowered to run more effectively without constant direction from the palace.

Grappo per 1.4 (B and D).  Summary ------- 1.  (S/NF)  Minister of the Royal Office and head of the Office of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Ali bin Majid al-Ma'amari, reviewed Oman's view on Iran from a security perspective, highlighting Omani awareness of Iran's deceptive tactics and expansionist ideological desires in the region.  During an introductory meeting with NAVCENT commander VADM William Gortney, accompanied by the Ambassador, General Ali addressed the Iranian nuclear file, security in the Strait of Hormuz, and Iranian interference in the region.  Ali Majid's suspicious view of Iran stands in stark contrast to conciliatory if not obsequious public comments of Omani Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 'Alawi regarding Iran and its role in the region.  End summary.  Won't Oppose Further Sanctions on Iran -------------------------------------- 2.  (S/NF)  Characterizing Oman's preference for "frankness and clarity," General Ali began his comments on Iran by noting the reality of Iran as a nearby neighbor, which influenced Oman's relations with Iran.  Toward the end of the discussion, he compared Oman's normal relations with Iran to the relations of other GCC members with Iran.  Throughout the meeting, he frequently touched on the theme of how different Oman was from other GCC member states, whose real intentions and positions often eluded Omani comprehension.  3.  (S/NF)  The Iranian nuclear issue stood at the forefront of the General's mind.  He described the nuclear file as an international issue, noting that resolution of this issue should be dealt with through international bodies such as the UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Oman would respect decisions of these groups and play its role in the international community.  Oman would not oppose imposition of further measures against Iran by the international bodies; however, Oman did not want to play an active role in advocating for such measures itself.  Iranian Intentions Clear:  Stall for Time ----------------------------------------- 4.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid stated that Oman was aware of Iranian stall tactics in the talks over the nuclear issue.  Instead of responding by the August 5 deadline, the Iranian side offered a new initiative for talks, confirming reports from the U.S. and others that Iran indeed is trying merely to buy time.  Letting the 5 August deadline pass in responding positively to the P5 1 proposal made the Iranian intention to stall "very clear to Oman."  The Ambassador noted that the U.S. has been working with allies around the world, and especially within the EU, to further restrict Iranian economic activity in an effort to influence Iran's position on the nuclear file.  General Ali agreed that sanctions to date were having an impact on the Iranian economy, despite Iran's public denials.  Moreover, he said, Iran believed the U.S. would never attack Iran, a belief that encouraged Iran to persist in its stall tactics.  Nevertheless, he advocated a non-military solution as the best option for the U.S., and suggested that over the long term, establishment of U.S. relations at some level with the Iranian government might enable the U.S. to better influence the Iranian government and people.  Empty Threats Against the Strait -------------------------------- 5.  (S/NF)  Responding to the Ambassador's question about recent Iranian statements threatening the Strait of Hormuz, Ali Majid dismissed the threats as "empty words" and perhaps a feeble attempt to up its bargaining leverage vis a vis the P5 1.  VADM Gortney echoed the Ambassador's comments that such rhetoric negatively impacted the world's view of Iran and ultimately would undermine Iran's standing in the international community.  On this same issue, the General expressed his pleasure with the White House press statement on August 5 responding to the IRGC commander's comments regarding closure of the Strait, agreeing that Iranian closure of the strait would be suicide (i.e., more harmful to Iran's own economic interests).  He also commended the U.S. for not escalating the rhetoric but instead putting Iran's comments into proper perspective.  Iraq and Iranian Expansionism  MUSCAT 00000565  002 OF 003   ----------------------------- 6.  (S/NF)  Prior to delving into the nuclear issues, Ali Majid acknowledged that Iranian interference in Iraq prevented achievement of a stable security environment there.  He allowed that, at a minimum, Iran indirectly supported Shi'a militia in Iraq.  Elaborating on his theme of "Iranian expansionist" ideology, he noted that the Iranian national radio broadcast commenced with the prelude "the voice of the Islamic Republic from Tehran."  Focusing on "from Tehran," he astutely raised Omani concerns that such language revealed Iran's true intentions:  a "greater Islamic Republic" with Tehran at its center.  He further speculated that Iran wanted to give the impression that the Islamic Republic might already encompass "Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and even the Gulf."  7.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid linked the nuclear issue and the interference in Iraq by speculating that a resolution might entice Iran into ceasing its interference in Iraq.  He offered a rhetorical question on whether Iran was serious about challenging the major powers or is it posturing in the media for domestic consumption.  He conceded that he truly did not know the answer, but that with Iran's continued attitude on the nuclear issue, the security situation in Iraq would remain unresolved.  Citing Oman's preference for a non-military solution, he nevertheless acknowledged that a nuclear-armed Iran as opposed to war with Iran posed "an extremely difficult dilemma for all of us."  Playing to Their Domestic Audience ---------------------------------- 8.  (S/NF)  Acknowledging Iran's revolutionary zeal, the General attempted to put Iranian public statements in perspective when he described as exaggerations those comments by Iranian President Mahmud Ahmed-I Nejad or other Iranian figures, particularly regarding military capabilities. "Countries that believe they have some specific military weapons advantages usually keep them secret," he averred.  He asserted that in the end, all power resided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  9.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid portrayed Shi'a ideology as another factor complicating possible military conflict with Iran. Iranian leaders would not balk at sacrificing a quarter of their 60 million citizens in a military conflict.  The Shi'a tradition of martyrdom spanned 14 centuries.  The annual self-flagellation of Shi'a over 1,400 years served as an example of this martyr psychology.  Beyond its Shi'a ideology, pride in its Persian national identity compelled Iran to demand international recognition and respect.  10.  (S/NF)  Returning back to comments about GCC countries, General Ali singled out Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar as three Gulf countries that probably would want the U.S. to strike Iran.  However, he urged the U.S. to determine whether such voices were speaking on the basis of logic or emotion.  He likened private entreaties of these countries to the U.S. for military action on Iran to the Iraqi opposition in exile providing the U.S. false information on Iraq that led to the invasion of Iraq.  At the beginning of the meeting, Ali Majid had noted that, in contrast to Oman, other GCC members did not always speak with candor or clarity, leaving Oman to question the real motivations or intentions of its GCC brethren.  11.  (S/NF)  Punctuating his comments about Iran's irrationality, Ali Majid pointed to Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi's recent comment that "Iran is crazy" not to pay attention to the history of Yugoslavia and Iraq, whose ignoring of U.S. pressure resulted in their collapse. Interestingly, he referred to Qadhafi's transformation from pariah to emerging member of the international community by noting that Qadhafi had once been "our enemy."  Oman in a "Strategic Relationship" with the U.S. --------------------------------------------- --- 12.  (S)  Shifting from Iran, Ali Majid underscored Oman's "strategic relationship" with the U.S. and highlighted Oman's cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism issues.  He described Oman's zero tolerance for extremism and refusal to negotiate with terrorists as a policy established at least since 1970 (the year of the Sultan's assumed power).  Oman has been and continues to prepare itself to confront terrorism, he said, as it is not exempt from the plotting of terrorists.  While Oman is "encircled by problems" -- specifically mentioning Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan --  MUSCAT 00000565  003 OF 003   Oman remains vigilant in preventing such problems from reaching the Sultanate.  On the topic of Oman's partnership with the U.S., he harkened back to when the Soviets had sought a warm water port during the time of their invasion of Afghanistan and were rebuffed by Muscat as an example of how "Oman has stood at the side of the U.S."  He also highlighted the irony that now the world faced "not the Soviets but the Taliban."  He quickly followed this by noting that the U.S. would be wise to support talks with moderate members of the Taliban, which Oman encouraged as a way toward achieving security in Afghanistan.  13.  (S/NF)  Participants in the meeting included VADM Gortney, the Ambassador, the admiral's executive officer, Embassy Muscat's OMC Chief, and GRPO (notetaker).  Sayyid Munthir bin Majid al-Sa'id, head of the Royal Office Liaison and Coordination Service participated as notetaker and translator for General Ali.  Comment ------- 14.  (S/NF)  In light of recent, more conciliatory statements by Minister Responsible for foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 'Alawi, Ali Majid's blunt assessment of Iranian intentions comes as refreshing reassurance of the official Omani position on Iran.  While careful to flag Oman's longstanding preference for a non-military solution to the Iran question and, less directly, Oman's inability to actively confront Iranian obstinacy, the Sultanate nevertheless maintains a clear-eyed view of Iran, its increasingly threatening behavior and the potential repercussions for the region.  His comments regarding attitudes and perceptions of fellow GCC members were startling as they would appear to confirm oft stated views of GCC counterparts of Oman as the sometimes "odd man out" in the GCC.  Ali Majid's comments suggest that while not entirely comfortable with this, the Omanis acknowledge it. Ali Majid, as the Sultan's top security official and advisor, is known for taking a more hard-line view of matters relating to regional security.  However, given his closeness to the Sultan and his status as a member of the inner-most circle of the Sultan's confidants, such views to a senior U.S. officer can be assumed to accord with those of Qaboos.

(S) On July 21, Pol Counselor delivered demarche on the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers meeting scheduled for Tehran from July 27-30 (Reftel A) to Saudi MFA Deputy Director for Western Affairs Department Mojahid Ali Alwahbi.  2. (S) Alwahbi informed us that Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (MFA Deputy Secretary equivalent) Dr. Nizar bin Obaid Madani would lead the Saudi delegation.  He assured us Saudi Arabia did not want the NAM meeting to become an Iranian propaganda event, adding he had seen the proposed agenda and did not expect it to develop in such a manner. Alwahbi agreed Iran's continued nuclear enrichment was a grave SAG concern with regional security implications (Reftel B).  3. (S) Alwahbi strongly advised against taking military action to neutralize Iran's program.  Rather, establishing a US-Iranian dialogue was the best course of action, asserting that the USG opening an Interest Section or re-opening our Embassy in Tehran would be positive step.  Alwahbi was heartened by the USG's initiative for Under Secretary Burns to meet with the Iranians last week in Geneva.  He added that, in his view, Iran's position was "shifting" and wanted to avoid escalation of tensions.  He noted his belief that the Russians had recently been effectively pressuring Iran to be less provocative.  Alwahbi concluded that he expected Iran to keep tensions relatively low at least until after the US presidential election.  4. (S) COMMENT.  These comments are typical of Saudi MFA bureaucrats who take a pacific stance towards Iran, but diverge significantly from the more bellicose advice we have gotten from senior Saudi royals.

(S) Summary: US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus met with Saudi King Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz, Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, General Presidency of Intelligence Chief Prince Muqrin bin Abd al-Aziz, and Interior Minister Nayif bin Abd al-Aziz during their April 14-15 visit to Riyadh.  The Saudi King and senior Princes reviewed Saudi policy toward Iraq in detail, all making essentially the same points.  They said that the Kingdom will not send an ambassador to Baghdad or open an embassy until the King and senior Saudi officials are satisfied that the security situation has improved and the Iraqi government has implemented policies that benefit all Iraqis, reinforce Iraq's Arab identity, and resist Iranian influence.  The Saudis evinced somewhat greater flexibility regarding the issues of economic and humanitarian assistance for Iraq and debt forgiveness.  In a conversation with the Charge' on April 17, Saudi Ambassador to the US Adel al-Jubeir indicated that the King had been very impressed by the visit of Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus, and al-Jubeir hinted that the Saudi government might announce changes to its Iraq policy before the President's visit to Riyadh in mid-May.  End Summary.  Positive Signs in Iraq  2. (S) In all their meetings with the Saudi royals, both Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus conveyed the progress in Iraq and confirmed the negative role Iran is playing in Iraq.  They characterized the recent ISF-led operations in Basra and Baghdad as having a striking effect against the Shia militias, most importantly turning Iraqi public opinion away from the militias.  While Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's decision to take action against the militias was described as hasty and not well-planned, Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus emphasized that any tactical shortfalls were overshadowed by the greater positive effect of unifying Iraq and demonstrating the GOI's, and most specifically al-Maliki's, determined resolve to take on the Shia militias, especially Jaysh al-Madhi.  Concurrently, these operations unequivocally demonstrated Iran's subversive activities in Iraq and its broader regional ambitions.  Throughout all their discussions, Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus stressed the importance and urgent need for the Saudis to join us in supporting Iraq.  The Saudi Embassy Issue  3.  (S) King Abdullah, the Foreign Minister, and Prince Muqrin all stated that the Saudi government would not send an ambassador to Baghdad or open an embassy there in the near future, citing both security and political grounds in support of this position.  The Foreign Minister stated that he had considered dispatching an ambassador and had sent Saudi diplomats to Baghdad to identify a site for the Saudi embassy.  However, he said. "the King simply forbade us to go any farther."  King Abdullah confirmed this account in a separate meeting with Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus.  The King asserted that the security situation in Baghdad was too dangerous for him to risk sending a Saudi ambassador there.  "He would immediately become a target for the terrorists and the militias," he said.  4.  (S) The King also rejected the suggestion that by sending a Saudi ambassador to Baghdad he could give essential political support to the Iraqi government as it struggles to resist Iranian influence and subversion.  He expressed lingering doubt on the Iraqi government's willingness to resist Iran.  He also repeated his frequently voiced doubts about Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki himself by alluding to his "Iranian connections."  The Saudi monarch stated that he does not trust al-Maliki because the Iraqi Prime Minister had "lied" to him in the past by promising to take certain actions and then failing to do so.  The King did not say precisely what these allegedly broken promises might have been.  He repeated his oft heard view that al-Maliki rules Iraq on behalf of his Shiite sect instead of all Iraqis.  5. (S) However, in a potentially significant move, the King did not reject the idea of dispatching a Saudi ambassador to Baghdad completely.  Instead, he said that he would consider  RIYADH 00000649  002 OF 003   doing so after the Iraqi provincial elections are held in the autumn.  The conduct of these elections would indicate whether or not the Iraqi government is truly interested in ruling on behalf of all Iraqis or merely in support of the Shia, King Abdullah asserted.  Grudging Acknowledgment of Change in Iraq  6.  (S) The Foreign Minister signaled another potential softening in Saudi policy by saying that the Kingdom's problem was not with al-Maliki as a person but rather with the conduct of the Iraqi government.  The King himself admitted that the Iraqi government's performance has improved in recent months and grudgingly accepted the point that al-Maliki and his security forces have indeed been fighting extremists, specifically Shia extremists in both Basra and Baghdad and Sunni extremists and Al Qaeda in Mosul.  However, the King and the senior Princes argued that more time would be required to judge whether the recent change in Iraqi behavior was lasting and sincere.  The King suggested that much of the Iraqi government's improved performance is attributable to US prodding rather than change in Iraqi attitudes.  7.  (S) The Foreign Minister also suggested that the USG should prod Ayatollah Sistani to speak out in favor of a unified Iraq and national reconciliation among different Iraqi sects and groups.  "You have paid a heavy price in blood and treasure, and Sistani and his people have benefited directly.  You have every right to ask this of him," Prince Saud al-Faisal said.  Possible Saudi Economic Assistance  8.  (S) The King, Prince Muqrin, and the Foreign Minister all suggested that the Saudi government might be willing to consider the provision of economic and humanitarian assistance to Iraq. Prince Muqrin asked Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus to send him a list of the kinds of assistance that the US government would like to see the Kingdom provide Iraq.  Al-Jubeir later told the Charge' that this assistance would be separate from the USD 1 billion in aid that the Saudi government had promised at the Madrid Conference but still not delivered due to security worries. He said that the Madrid commitment consisted of $500 million in trade credits and $500 million in project assistance with strict conditionally, along the lines of what the World Bank would require.  Al-Jubeir added that the assistance the Saudi government might provide via Prince Muqrin would initially be in the range of $75-$300 million.  Possible Debt Relief  9.  (S) The King noted that Saudi debt relief for Iraq "will come at some point," although he did not say when. Al-Jubeir told the Charge' that debt relief is a real possibility. He also noted that the Saudi government might make changes to its Iraq policy, perhaps including both assistance and debt relief, prior to the President's visit to Riyadh.  The Need to Resist Iran  10.  (S) The King, Foreign Minister, Prince Muqrin, and Prince Nayif all agreed that the Kingdom needs to cooperate with the US on resisting and rolling back Iranian influence and subversion in Iraq.  The King was particularly adamant on this point, and it was echoed by the senior princes as well. Al-Jubeir recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US to attack Iran and so put an end to its nuclear weapons program.  "He told you to cut off the head of the snake," he recalled to the Charge', adding that working with the US to roll back Iranian influence in Iraq is a strategic priority for the King and his government.  11.  (S) The Foreign Minister, on the other hand, called instead for much more severe US and international sanctions on Iran, including a travel ban and further restrictions on bank lending.  Prince Muqrin echoed these views, emphasizing that some sanctions could be implemented without UN approval.  The Foreign Minister also stated that the use of military pressure against Iran should not be ruled out.   RIYADH 00000649  003 OF 003   12.  (S) Comment: Saudi attitudes toward Iraq, from the King on down, remain marked by skepticism and suspicion.  That said, the Saudis have noticed recent events in Iraq and are eager to work with the US to resist and reverse Iranian encroachment in Iraq.  The King was impressed by Ambassador Crocker's and General Petraeus' visit, as were the Foreign Minister, GPI Chief, and Interior Minister. Cautious as ever, the Saudis may nevertheless be willing to consider new measures in the areas of assistance and debt relief, although further discussions will be required to make these ideas a reality.

[DETAILS REMOVED]Ahmadi-Nejads Election and the IRC----------------------------------- 8. (S) Per the IRCs regulations, following his election in 2005, President Ahmadi-Nejad was able to appoint four members (out of 16) of the IRC management group. These four [NAMES REMOVED] were opposed to the IRCs leadership and eventually requested its president, Dr. Ahmad Ali Noorbala, to resign. [DETAILS REMOVED] He did so in January 2006 [DETAILS REMOVED] Most of the incoming managers were members of the IRGC or the MOIS. [NAME REMOVED] said that pre-existing members now considered the IRC an agent of the IRGC.9.

All government agencies include an MOIS representative [DETAILS REMOVED]  [NAME REMOVED]  Prior to Ahmadi-Nejad, the IRC official in this position was the sole MOIS representative; afterwards, [NAME REMOVED] said 40 officers at headquarters and 100 officers at the provincial officers came from the MOIS.10. (S) [DETAILS REMOVED] in line with Ahmadinejads government-wide directive, that all employees pass a counterintelligence course. [NAME REMOVED] indicated that such a course violated the principles of the IRC because Red Cross/Red Crescent organizations are supposed to be independent from the state.11.

The second, owned by the IRGC, produces pre-fabricated military commands and mobile hospitals. The third, owned by the Defense Ministry, produces armored personnel carriers.14.(C) Finally, the IRC [DETAILS REMOVED] began building health clinics in Karbala, Najaf, Hilla, Kazemayn, and Basra and awarded the construction contracts to IRGC companies, despite the IRCs own staff of qualified engineers. [NAME REMOVED] said the clinics would be used for treatment but also as warehouses for military equipment or military bases if needed. He noted that the Iraqi Red Crescent and Iraqi Ministry of Health were not happy with this activity.Facilitating IRGC Support to Hezbollah-------------------------------------- 15. (S) The IRC again facilitated the entry of Qods force officers to Lebanon during the Israel-Hezbollah war in summer 2006. Although [NAME REMOVED] did not travel to Lebanon during the conflict, he reiterated that the only true IRC officers dispatched to Lebanon were [DETAILS REMOVED] all others were IRGC and MOIS officials. [NAME REMOVED] further said that the IRC shipments of medical supplies served also to facilitate weapons shipments.

The plane was allegedly half full prior to the arrival of any medical supplies.16. (S) [NAME REMOVED] also allowed the transfer of an IRC hospital in southern Lebanon to Hezbollah. [NAME REMOVED] said that Hassan Nasrallah had asked Supreme Leader Khamenei to allow Hezbollah to run the hospital during Dr. Noorbalas tenure as IRC president. Although Khamenei acquiesced, Dr. Noorbala prevented the transfer until his own departure. The hospitaL [DETAILS REMOVED] is under Hezbollah control.

S E C R E T STATE 128877  SIPDIS SECRET//REL SAU  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/2018 TAGS: EFIN IR KNNP PARM PINR PRELSUBJECT: RESPONSE TO SAUDI REQUEST FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON IRAN  REF: A. RIYADH 1667      B. STATE 115523  Classified By: ISN PATRICIA A. MCNERNEY, REASONS 1.4(b) AND (d)  1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 4.  ------- SUMMARY -------  2.  (S//REL SAU) During the week of 13 October and in response to ISN Acting Assistant Secretary Patricia McNerney's encouragement to help increase pressure on Iran to change course, Saudi MFA Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs, Prince Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud Al-Kabeer requested U.S. recommendations on specific actions Saudi Arabia could take (REF A).  Washington would like to provide the following non-paper to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which contains suggestions on how to further enhance Saudi Arabia,s non-proliferation efforts with regard to Iran.  3.  On October 16, 2008, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by Iran's lack of a sufficient anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime (REF B). During the same plenary meeting, FATF also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement UNSCR 1803's call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in Iran, in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.  These two actions by the FATF, combined with the already widely held view that Iranian financial institutions play a key role in Iran's proliferation efforts, merit immediate action by countries to mitigate these illicit finance risks.   ---------- OBJECTIVES ----------  4.  (S//REL SAU) Washington requests Embassy Riyadh approach Prince Turki, or other appropriate senior KSA officials, to discuss this issue and provide U.S. recommendations.  Post should pursue the following objectives:  -- Present the non-paper at paragraph 5 to KSA officials.  -- Urge host government to issue a public statement that advances the October 2008 FATF statement on Iran, and encourage all regional partners to do the same.  -- Encourage host government to carefully monitor any financial and commercial activity with Iran within KSA to ensure that Iran does not pursue illicit transactions via the KSA.  -- Encourage host government to use its influence in the GCC to invigorate further actions by regional partners to enhance vigilance over financial and commercial activity with Iran, as is called for by the Financial Action Task Force and UNSCRs 1737, 1747, and 1803.   -------- NONPAPER --------  5.  (S//REL SAU)  BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR SAUDI ARABIA  During Acting Assistant Secretary Patricia McNerney's visit to Saudi Arabia on 15 October 2008, she raised the issue of Iran's nuclear program and the need to increase pressure on the Iranian regime to address international concerns surrounding its nuclear activities.  Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs Prince Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud Al-Kabeer requested suggestions on steps the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia could take in this regard.  We believe your government should consider taking action on the following key priorities:  -- National Financial Measures  -- Export Control Implementation  -- Express Resolve on the Iranian Threat, and  -- Full Implementation of UNSCRs, particularly 1803.  Your vigilance thus far demonstrates your government,s recognition that real action must be taken to protect the region,s security by preventing Iranian proliferation. We believe that if your government implemented the actions suggested in this paper, it would not only allow you to exercise influential leadership with regional neighbors, it would significantly increase the pressure on Iran to cooperate with the international community and address its concerns.  We would like to present to you the following recommendations and the United States is prepared to work with the KSA to assist with the incorporation of these measures into Saudi Arabia's nonproliferation system.  National Financial Measures:  -- We urge the Saudi Government to issue a public statement that advances the October 2008 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) statement on Iran. The Saudi statement should recommend heightened vigilance and the implementation of preventive measures, per FATF,s October statements, by all countries with respect to the financial transactions with Iran given the significant vulnerability that Iran poses to the international financial system. A statement like this from your government would send a clear message to your GCC partners that the risk arising from Iranian banking transactions is real and that action must be taken to protect the region,s banking system and prevent Iranian proliferation.  -- On October 16, the FATF issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by Iran's lack of a sufficient anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime. In contrast with prior FATF actions on Iran, this statement marked a significant escalation in concern about the terrorism finance threat emanating from Iran and ratcheted up the call for preventive measures that should be implemented by FATF members and other jurisdictions to protect their financial sectors from this risk.  -- During the October plenary meeting, FATF also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1803's call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in Iran, in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.  -- Iran uses deceptive tactics and front companies to disguise its proliferation activities.  The U.S. recommends that Saudi Arabia highlight this fact with its domestic businesses and GCC partners.  -- We also recommend that you reduce Saudi Arabian Industries Corporation (SABIC) activities in Iran,s petrochemicals market. The U.S. also proposes that Saudi Arabia suspend Iran-GCC free trade area talks until Iran accepts the P5 1 incentives package.  -- U.S. Executive Order (E.O.) 13382 is an authority that allows the U.S. to block the assets of WMD proliferators and their supporters and thereby deny them access to the U.S. financial and commercial systems. The U.S. recommends that Saudi Arabia explore the creation of a similar legal authority.  Export Control Implementation:  -- Saudi Arabia should begin work on drafting a comprehensive export control law and adopt a comprehensive control list that meets international standards, including the standards set by the four multilateral export control regimes (Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, and Wassenaar Group).  -- A comprehensive export control system will give Saudi Arabia the ability to ensure that its trade is secure and will encourage high technology investment.  -- The United States is prepared to support Saudi Arabia in this regard, including through our Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Program.  Express Resolve on the Iranian Threat:  -- Saudi Arabia should exercise leadership with neighbors in the region and publicly by expressing concerns about Iran,s continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability and destabilizing activities in the region.  -- We would appreciate public expressions of support for the P5 1 dual track process including encouragement for Iran to accept the incentives package.  -- Saudi Arabia should exercise its influence with China, in particular, to persuade China to reduce its growing energy/economic cooperation and weapons purchases. Such efforts by China run contrary to the spirit of the UNSCRs and the P5 1 dual track strategy. A high level Saudi delegation could communicate to China Saudi concerns about the threat posed by Iran,s actions.  Full Implementation of UNSCRs:  -- Full implementation of UNSCRs 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), and 1803 (2008), through vigilance and action against Iran,s efforts to circumvent sanctions are key components to maintaining pressure on Iran.  -- A useful step would be for KSA to vigorously implement UNSCR provisions such as freezing financial assets and imposing travel restrictions on designated entities and individuals, prohibit dual-use exports, call for inspections of IRISL and Iran Air Cargo shipment, and exercise vigilance over any activities of financial institutions in KSA with Iranian domiciled banks.  -- As a reference, the U.S. 60-day report on implementation of UNSCR 1803 can be found at: www.un.org/sc/committees/1737/memberstatesrep orts.shtml   END NONPAPER FOR SAUDI ARABIA  ------------------ REPORTING DEADLINE ------------------  6.

YEREVAN 657, B. State 97802  Classified By: EUR/FO DAS Garber, Reasons 1.4 (b), (c), and (d).  1.  (U) Please deliver the following letter from Deputy Secretary Negroponte.  There will be no signed original.  Embassy should also propose discussions with the Government of Armenia in coming weeks. Suggested dates and team composition will be provided septel. Embassy Yerevan is requested to report response.  2.  (Secret/Rel Armenia) Begin Letter:   Dear Mr. President:          We value our positive relationship with your government, as we explore a range of shared interests, especially an agreement on Nagorno Karabakh and normalization of Armenia's relations with Turkey.  At the same time, we are dismayed by a serious  and, indeed, deadly - arms re-export case.          Secretary Rice, Assistant Secretary Fried, Deputy Assistant Secretary Bryza, and Ambassador Yovanovitch have raised with you our deep concerns about Armenia's transfer of arms to Iran which resulted in the death and injury of U.S. soldiers in Iraq. Notwithstanding the close relationship between our countries, neither the Administration nor the U.S. Congress can overlook this case.  By law, the transfer of these weapons requires us to consider whether there is a basis for the imposition of U.S. sanctions.  If sanctions are imposed, penalties could include the cutoff of U.S. assistance and certain export restrictions.          To avoid such sanctions, it is essential that you present compelling evidence that your government is now in partnership with us to ensure such transfers do not occur in the future.          To convince the United States that this will not happen again, we seek a written agreement from Armenia, memorializing its intent to implement measures that will prevent Armenia from becoming a source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups involved with terrorism and/or weapons proliferation.  Such measures include:  -- Reform the Armenian Export Control Commission so its members are full time employees who exclusively work on export controls;  -- Establish, at each point of entry into Armenia, Armenian teams dedicated to detecting and interdicting dual-use commodities and other contraband;  -- Periodically accept unannounced visits by U.S. experts to assess the work of the teams;  -- Harmonize Armenia's export control legislation with that of the EU;  -- Update and make public Armenian export control lists, incorporating the control lists of the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, and other international control regimes;  -- Ensure that Armenian-based brokers do not facilitate arms related transfers; and  -- Consult with the United States on transfers to countries that are not member states of NATO or the EU, or participating states of the Wassenaar Arrangement.          We are prepared to send a team as early as possible in the New Year to discuss this proposal further.  It is my hope that we can work together to forge a positive outcome which provides your government the opportunity to strengthen Armenia's export controls and for my government to assist you in this effort.  Sincerely, John D. Negroponte  End text of letter.  3.  (S) Background:  In 2003, Armenia facilitated Iran's purchase of rockets and machine guns.  In 2007, some of these weapons were recovered from two Shia militant attacks in which a United States soldier was killed and six others were injured in Iraq.  The Secretary discussed our concerns with President Sargsian on the margins of the UN General Assembly, but he denied any transfer occurred.  The direct role of high-level Armenian officials and the link of the weapons to an attack on U.S. forces make this case unique and highly troubling.  These transfers may provide a basis for sanctions pursuant to U.S. legal authorities.  We propose a series of steps that Armenia will need to take to prevent future transfers, which will be weighed in the consideration of sanctions. We hope to use the threat of sanctions as a tool to generate Armenian responsiveness so that we will not be forced to impose sanctions measures.  4.  (S) The Deputy Secretary is writing to President Sargsian and indicating that a team will be sent to Armenia to seek written agreement that Armenia will take steps to ensure that it does not become a source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups of concern.  The team will also present additional information that will make clear why the United States is convinced that the transfers happened and make it unreasonable for Sargsian to continue his denials.  We anticipate that the team will travel to Yerevan in the coming weeks, to provide sufficient time for the incoming Administration to be briefed on the situation.  5.  (S) Objective:  Our objective is to prevent Armenia from becoming a source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups of concern, without derailing a possible Nagorno-Karabakh settlement. Embassy Yerevan should seek to convey the seriousness with which the United States views this issue and emphasize that the transfer of arms to Iran and subsequently to terrorists in Iraq, in particular transfers that resulted in the death of an American serviceman, cannot be overlooked by the United States.  6.  (U) Please contact EUR/PRA Matt Hardiman and ISN/CATR Margaret Mitchell with any questions or follow-up issues related to this case and slug any reporting on this issue for ISN and EUR. RICE

(S) Posts are requested to approach appropriate-level host nation officials regarding a planned North Korean flight to Iran of proliferation concern and encourage them to deny overflight for the aircraft or require that it land and be subjected to inspection before proceeding.  Posts may draw from background, objectives, and talking points/non-paper below as appropriate.  ---------- OBJECTIVES ----------  2.  (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN):  Posts should encourage host governments, as partner nations in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and consistent with their obligations under UNSCRs 1718, 1737, and 1747, to deny overflight or to insist that the aircraft land for inspection before proceeding.  3.  (S//REL CHINA) Embassy Beijing should encourage China, consistent with its obligations under UNSCRs 1718, 1737, and 1747, to deny overflight or to insist that the aircraft land for inspection before proceeding.  4.  (S//REL KAZAKHSTAN) Our information currently does not indicate a North Korean intent to overfly Kazakhstan, suggesting that GOK, per REFTEL, has denied the DPRK,s request.  Embassy Astana is requested to express appreciation for GOK,s proactively notifying us of the DPRK overflight request and urge them to deny any such request if they have not already done so.  Post may share the below non-paper with GOK, as appropriate.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  5.  (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN)  The USG has received information that a flight of proliferation concern between North Korea and Iran is scheduled to occur in late July.  6. (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, TAJIKISTAN) Our information does not currently indicate a North Korean intent to route the flight over Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, or Tajikistan.  We are, however, providing them this information in the spirit of our cooperation under PSI, and to ask them to deny overflight or inspect the aircraft in the event the North Koreans re-route the flight.  7. (S) Embassies should note that bullet #1 is for Beijing only, bullet #2 is for all recipients except Beijing, and bullet #3 is for Astana, Kabul, and Dushanbe only.

UNSCR 1718 also prohibits transfers from or to North Korea of technical training, advice, services or assistance related to WMD, their delivery systems, and certain conventional arms. Iran is prohibited from obtaining WMD, delivery systems, related components, and related technical assistance and training under UNSCRs 1737 and 1747.  -- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) We therefore request that overflight permission be denied or made contingent on inspection of the aircraft to ensure that any cargo or passengers it carries are not arriving in Iran in violation of UNSCR 1718, 1737, 1747 or other UN resolutions.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 002760  SIPDIS  TREASURY FOR LEVEY, S. ATHENS FOR PURCELL, A.  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/2018 TAGS: KTFN EFIN ECON KWBG IR ISSUBJECT: U/S LEVEY REASSURES GOI THAT NO MOMENTUM WILL BE LOST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR FINANCE  Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  ------- SUMMARY -------  1.(S) In a visit to Israel on 16-17 November, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Stuart A. Levey, reassured GOI officials that no momentum would be lost in USG efforts to combat terrorist financing or to pressure Iran during the transition to a new US administration in January. In meetings with Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, Mossad Director Meir Dagan, National Security Council Chairman Dani Arditi, and others, U/S Levey emphasized recent U.S. designations against the Union of Good, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and the recent revocation of Iran's "U-Turn" license. In response to GOI officials' pressure to have the U.S. designate the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Levey underscored the importance of international, multilateral concurrence for such an effort to be a success.  2.(S) Israeli officials were keen to outline an "escalation" in CBI programs that they believed pose a danger to the international financial system. Several key Israeli officials identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI, as a key figure in masterminding new ways to help the Iranian commercial and banking sectors circumvent sanctions. Levey promised to continue pushing the Gulf states on adopting stronger regulation until the last day of his appointment.  3.(S) Mossad Chief Meir Dagan informed Levey that sanctions were beginning to have a negative effect on Iran's regime. NSC Chairman Arditi also told him that the PA was performing well in its renewed fight against terror finance in the West Bank. END SUMMARY.  --------------------------------------------- ----- GOI CONCERNED ABOUT COUNTER TERROR FINANCE POLICY CONTINUITY --------------------------------------------- -----  4.(S) National Security Council (NCS) Chairman, Dani Arditi, in a November 16 meeting with U/S Stuart Levey, asked whether Levey thought his efforts would continue into the next U.S. administration. Even though he said he planned to resign as required in January, Levey told Arditi that he believed the Obama team would be committed to continuing the ambitious program against terrorism finance that he has shepherded over the last several years. Saying counter- terrorism finance was not a partisan issue in the U.S., Levey subsequently confirmed these sentiments to Foreign Minister (FM) Tzipi Livni and Mossad Director Meir Dagan in separate meetings that occurred on the following day, November 17.  ---------------------- IRAN/NON-PROLIFERATION ----------------------  5.(S) On November 16, Levey outlined for Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar, and Senior Deputy Director General Yossi Gal positive developments in the Iran effort. He told them that Treasury had been very successful in curtailing business with Iran by most "major players". Levey said that expanding the non-proliferation strategy into insurance, and putting pressure on Iran's oil refining capacity and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) industry were next steps being pursued. He also reported that the recent IRISL designation has been unusually effective.  CBI's Reza Raei Masterminds New Methods ---------------------------------------  6.(S) During their November 16 meeting, Arditi told Levey that the Israeli intelligence community has continued to see an escalation in CBI efforts to help designated Iranian commercial banks circumvent international and U.S. sanctions.  The NSC Chairman presented several recent examples of CBI behavior that he characterized as unusual for a central bank. Arditi identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI for Foreign Exchange Affairs, as the mastermind of these new  TEL AVIV 00002760  002 OF 004   efforts.  7.(S) Meir Dagan subsequently told Levey that the CBI had engineered a way for the UN-designated Iranian bank Sepah to conduct foreign business transactions through use of the Iranian Postal Bank. Bank Melli, a USG-designated bank, had also purchased shares in investment funds as a way to escape the effects of the sanctions, according to Dagan. Using these methods, Melli and Sepah have been able to fabricate a method of providing correspondent-like banking services to designated Iranian banks that find it increasingly difficult to deal in foreign currency. Arditi named the "Persia Equity Fund" as one such financial instrument being used by Melli. Levey commented that any such investment fund or financial instrument could be listed as a derivative designation of Melli if enough evidence could be shown linking the two organizations. Levey told Meir Dagan that he was in favor of pursuing a designation of Raei if GOI allegations were accurate.  No International Support for Designation of the CBI --------------------------------------------- ------  8.(S) Arditi and subsequently, Dagan, asked Levey whether the USG was considering a designation of the CBI. Although Treasury had looked into the possibility, said Levey, a designation of the CBI would be ineffective without a multilateral effort. International support for such an effort simply did not yet exist, Levey explained. He told Dagan that we need to build support by sharing info about the CBI's illicit conduct, similar to the support we built for cutting off the U-turn license. Levey said that it would be better to focus on limiting other central and commercial banks' business with the CBI. Noting that the banking industry relies heavily on reputation, Levey told Arditi that the right strategy is to continue exposing the illicit activities of Iranian banks and banking officials.  European Banks' Business with Iran ----------------------------------  9.(S) MFA interlocutors revisited the progress of European banks in non-proliferation efforts. In a November 16 meeting with Yossi Gal, Senior Deputy Director General, and Alon Bar, Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs, Gal raised concerns that Italy and Germany were falling short in their commitment to enforce sanctions within their banking sectors. Gal told Levey that the MFA was planning a visit to Italy in December, but was unsure whether its attempt to persuade the politicians would filter down to action within the bureaucracy. Gal expressed the same concern about the banking sector in Germany, saying that resistance from the bureaucracy and the private sector often undermined attempts by political figures to improve German regulation. Bar and Gal encouraged Levey to join the GOI in pressing the governments and banking sectors of Germany and Italy to do more.  Cautious Optimism on Gulf States --------------------------------  10.(S) On the status of UAE efforts to stem Iranian finance, Levey told Gal and Bar that he was optimistic about the country's efforts. Among other examples, he mentioned that the UAE had decreased the number of visas it was issuing to Iranian nationals and that Emirati ministers were receptive to his requests for increased banking regulation.  11.(S) FM Livni told Levey that Israel continues to encourage the Gulf states to more publicly outline their actions against Iranian finance within their banking sectors despite the countries' reasons for keeping such actions secretive. She asked Levey to join in this effort. Levey affirmed that the USG was encouraging sanctions in all sectors and posited that the Iranians were beginning to feel the pressure. Livni asked if the declining price of oil was becoming leverage in the efforts to thwart Iranian financial efforts. Levey said that it was and that the Iranian private sector was becoming more vocal in its criticisms of the government.  12.(S) Levey outlined for his GOI interlocutors recent  TEL AVIV 00002760  003 OF 004   efforts by Treasury to broaden its sanctioning of Iran to the shipping, insurance, and reinsurance industries. He cited the designation of IRISL as a positive first step and mentioned that Treasury had found willing partners in Europe and the UK to further efforts in this area.  Effect of Sanctions on Iran ---------------------------  13.(S) Dagan told Levey that the economic problems Iran is experiencing as a result of sanctions are encouraging debate within the regime. He said that in order to preserve the revolution, some key figures have begun to consider the need for change. The pressure is on, Dagan said, but he could not estimate when Iran would hit the brink. He noted that the lower cost of oil at the moment would likely prompt Iran to increase its production, thereby encouraging more business through the CBI. With oil prices low everywhere, however, Dagan and Levey agreed that Iran was a less attractive place for investment. Levey told Dagan that the present low oil prices provide a critical opportunity to convince other members of the international community to apply more pressure.  14.(S) Livni asked Levey if there was a risk of Iran regaining a foothold in certain markets as a result of the world financial crisis. Levey said that the market turmoil has worked to the USG's advantage: the crisis has made financial institutions even more risk-averse, thereby lessening Iran's attractiveness even further. Additionally, while Iran's banks are isolated, its economy is not.  U.S. Engagement with Iran -------------------------  15.(S) FM Livni asked Levey during their November 17 meeting why the USG was considering a rapprochement with Iran through a U.S. Interests section in Tehran. She questioned whether the tactic would have a net positive outcome when measured against the negative perceptions such a move would be bound to create. Levey told Livni that this was a question better posed to the State Department, but that her concern was the central issue being debated by policy makers in Washington. In Levey's previous meeting with MFA officials Bar and Gal, he said that engagement with Iran would not work without leverage, indicating that sanctions would need to be in place no matter what the USG decides to do.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- STEMMING PALESTINIAN TERROR FINANCE: GOI PLEASED WITH PA'S PROGRESS --------------------------------------------- -------------  16.(S) Levey told Arditi that Treasury's recent designation of the "Union of Good" was proof of the USG's commitment to continue to work against Hamas and Palestinian terrorists. Levey said, however, that while the USG supported efforts at thwarting terrorism in the territories, the USG wished to keep humanitarian goods flowing to the needy within the population.  17.(S) Arditi told Levey that Palestinian Authority (PA) efforts at stemming terrorism within the territories were going quite well. He said the PA's positive efforts "surprised" his staff and that he "never thought" the PA would do so well. Levey said that Treasury coordinated with Prime Minister Fayyad on the Union of Good designation and was pleased to hear that PA efforts were held in high regard by the GOI.  18.(S) When Levey inquired about efforts to prevent correspondent banking relations in Gaza from being severed, Arditi said that the Postal Bank "was on the agenda". Arditi lamented that the services provided by the Postal Bank would not be as good because of its small size and limited capacity. He expressed his hope that the central bank governor would be able to delay the commercial banks' decision to end their relationship with the Palestinians until a permanent solution was ensured.  19.(S) This cable has been cleared by Under Secretary Stuart  TEL AVIV 00002760  004 OF 004   Levey.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv  You can also access this site through the State Department's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM
S E C R E T ABU DHABI 001151  NOFORN SIPDIS STATE FOR NEA/FO AND NEA/ARP ENERGY FOR S1, S2, O???CONNOR AND SANDOLOW  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2019/12/17 TAGS: PGOV PREL PARM ENRG IR YM AESUBJECT: ABU DHABI CROWN PRINCE WARNS DOE DEPSEC PONEMAN ABOUT IRAN  CLASSIFIED BY: Richard G. Olson, Ambassador, State, US Embassy Abu Dhabi, UAE; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)  1. (S/NF) Summary: During a December 9 meeting in Abu Dhabi (other meetings reported septel), Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman told Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) that the USG shared many energy policy priorities with the UAE, including renewable energy development and the importance of critical energy infrastructure protection.  Poneman briefed MbZ on the Teheran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal and Vienna talks.  MbZ said he would be surprised if Iran accepted the P5+1/IAEA proposal and warned that Iran was already acting like a nuclear power. Further, and more dangerously, Iran is establishing "emirates" across the Muslim world, including South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper "emirates" in Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, the mother of all "emirates" in Southern Iraq, and now Saada in Yemen.  MbZ suggested that the U.S. is misreading the situation in Yemen and failing to recognize strong evidence of Iranian support.  End Summary.    POTENTIAL COOPERATION:  RENEWABLES, INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION  -------------------------------------    2. (SBU) The Crown Prince asked DepSec Poneman several questions about U.S. energy development plans, including the outlook for the next 25 years.  Poneman explained President Obama and Secretary Chu have a strategic vision of a new energy economy with a low carbon profile.  In the short term, Poneman said DOE is investing Recovery Act funds to improve efficiency and support new technologies, but that the USG seeks to facilitate energy development through a portfolio approach, not dictate what the market should pursue. On nuclear, MbZ specifically asked what progress could be expected within the next three years.  Poneman said there are a number of active deals under development, and strong public support for nuclear power, but that capital costs continue to be a challenge. (Comment:  MbZ pressed hard on US plans for a nuclear renaissance, suggesting to us that he is worried we may compete with his program in the hunt for nuclear engineering and technical talent. End Comment.) Turning to renewable energy and efficiency, the DepSec noted that USG goals are very much in line with Abu Dhabi's own Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company) and that he looked forward to greater DOE-Masdar cooperation (septel).    3. (SBU) Poneman also told MbZ that the USG is interested in supporting Abu Dhabi's critical energy infrastructure protection (CEIP) plans and said a DOE team was discussing cooperation potential with the Critical National Infrastructure Authority (CNIA, reported septel).  Learning from Hurricane Katrina, DOE was focused on survivability of assets, resiliency and recovery.  MbZ said he was personally very interested in greater cooperation with the U.S. on CEIP, through DOE, other USG entities and/or the private sector.  He stressed that citizens' confidence in their government was very important, noting "We're doing our best to make them feel secure."  MbZ added that while UAE is a small country, it has the resources to protect itself, and is willing to invest in top-quality infrastructure protection.    IRAN  ----    4. (S/NF) DepSec Poneman briefed MbZ on the international proposal for Iran to ship 1,200 kg of Low Enriched Uranium produced at Natanz to a location outside Iran and where it would be enriched to 20 percent for use to produce medical radioisotopes at the Tehran Research Reactor.  Poneman stressed that the IAEA, the Russians, and the U.S. had all taken every possible step to address stated Iranian concerns, including a first-ever official USG statement of support for the proposal.  He stressed that the offer would not remain open indefinitely; as DG El Baradei had said, this is a "fleeting" opportunity.  He also explained that the extra effort had strengthened international cooperation, with Russia and China supportive of the recent IAEA Board of Governors resolution.   Poneman stressed that the deal was not offered out of naivete, but rather out of the view that if Iran agreed it would remove a significant amount of LEU from Natanz and if Iran refused it would help build international support - beginning with Russia and China - for tougher sanctions.  5. (S/NF) The Crown Prince said he would be "very surprised" if a deal was possible, as Iran's nuclear program is not an issue of internal conflict but rather one of national pride for the vast majority of Iranians.  He stressed that Iran is not North Korea, because 1) it is looking to reestablish a Persian empire in the 21st century, 2) Iran has resources and lacks neighbors, including the UAE, who can pressure it, 3) the leadership has not changed (it is the same people who seized Embassy Tehran in 1979) , and 4) Iran believes itself to be a superpower.  Poneman said the USG does not disagree with MbZ's analysis, but believes pride makes the Iranian leadership more susceptible to the pressure of the world community uniting against them, whereas North Korea revels in its own isolation.  MbZ agreed, and emphasized the strategic importance of creating a Palestinian State (i.e., resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) as the way to create genuine Middle Eastern unity on the question of Iran's nuclear program and regional ambitions.    YEMEN  -----    6. (S/NF) MbZ said Iran already acts like a superpower and explained that, while the UAE is a federation of emirates, Iran's "emirates" have a larger army and budget that the UAE.  In addition to Iran's established emirates in South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper emirates in Kuwait, Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and the mother of all emirates in Southern Iraq.  Now Iran has an emirate in Saada.  MbZ told Poneman, "We believe you don't want us to believe" the mounting evidence of Iranian involvement in Yemen. He stressed that he doesn't believe Ali Abdullah Saleh either, but this is "not like cracking the enigma code" (in World War II), there are Iranian ships unloading weapons for the Houthis, and "you have the capability to track this."  He warned, "We know your priority is Al-Qaeda, but don't forget Iran. Al-Qaeda is not going to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time."    7. (SBU) DepSec Poneman has cleared this cable. OLSON
S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000192   NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2019 TAGS: PREL PARM MOPS MASS IR AESUBJECT: URGENT UAE REQUEST FOR AIR DEFENSE -- FIVE PATRIOT BATTERIES THIS YEAR  Classified by Ambassador Richard Olson, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (S/NF) Summary:  UAE Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces convoked the Ambassador to request the urgent deployment of five U.S. patriot batteries in the UAE as an interim measure until the UAE's own batteries are operational (anticipated in 2012).  The UAE belief that an increasingly likely pre-emptive Israeli attack on Iran would prompt quick retaliation on U.S. allies (foremost among them the very proximate UAE) prompted the request.  End summary.  2.  (C) On 22 February 2009, Ambassador Richard Olson, Defense Attache (DATT) Colonel Bret Rider and Chief, US Liaison Office (USLO) Colonel David Sprague were summoned to the office of the Chief of Staff of the UAE Armed Forces (COS), where they were met by the COS, LTG Hamid Thani al Rumaithy, Director Military Intelligence and Security (MISS) MGen Eissa al Mazrouei, Commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence (AF) AVM Mohammed Swaidan al Qamzi and the COSs office director BGen Faris Mohammed al Mazroui.  3.  (S) Following very brief pleasantries the COS bluntly commented: "I need to be open and frank with you, there are changes in the region that concern us."  On behalf of his government, the COS then made an official request of the US government to deploy between four and five Patriot batteries to the UAE during calendar year 2009.  He requested these batteries remain in place until such time as they can be replaced by the UAE's own nine batteries, currently on order.  4.  (S/NF) The UAE would place three of the US batteries in and around Abu Dhabi, one battery at the port of Jebel Ali, and a final battery somewhere else in the northern emirates (presumably Dubai). The COS noted previous studies on the placement of the batteries are on file and will help guide final placement.  The COS stated the batteries would be used to protect critical military and civilian targets.  5.  (S/NF) The COS noted that Iran will continue doing its best to keep the entire region unstable.  Iran is recognized as Israel's biggest threat in the region and Israel will attack Iran with little or no notice.  Following an Israeli attack, the UAE is convinced Iran will lash out against those who "help Israel," or the allies of Israel's friends, most significantly the UAE.  The COS noted the UAE has the Patriot system on order and expects to take delivery in 2012.  He went on to mention the pending deployment of a single Patriot battery to protect Al Dhafra Air Base -- which should be operational within the next 30 to 60 days.  The COS noted the UAE operational capacity will come too late and the single US battery will be too little to stop Iranian missiles if they attack sooner rather than later.  6.  (S/NF) Hamid Thani senses indications and warnings the Israeli government now being formed will likely attack Iran.  He thinks the new (Netanyahu) government will be very determined to eliminate the threat of Iranian missiles, especially nuclear tipped ones, which they fear may come raining down on Israeli cities.  He also stated Israel would be justified to take such action as it must protect its citizens just as any nation has the duty to do.  He feels that a breakthrough in international efforts in regard to Iran's armament programs may slow Israel's actions.  However, the COS knows that Israel must maintain all its options.  He also knows the Iranians have toyed with the international community for over ten years as they built their capability.  He stated the Israelis are also very aware of Iranian tactics.  7.  (S/NF) When pressed on what type of event may precipitate an Israeli attack, the COS thought the delivery of the Russian S-300 system could be the catalyst.  The COS stated very flatly that "I don't trust the Russians, I've never trusted the Russians or the Iranians."  8.  (S/NF) The COS went on to request continued and expanded intelligence sharing between the US and the UAE.  He asked the DATT what advance warning the US could expect of an Iranian attack.  He quickly added that he asks the same question of his MISS chief at least twice a week and gets no answer -- as he knows there is no good answer.  (Note: The COS served as the MISS chief prior to becoming COS and knows very well the capabilities related to predicting Iranian actions.  End note.)  9.  (C) The meeting ended nearly as quickly as it began with both sides wishing each other good will and great success during the International Defense Exhibition (IDEX) opening later in the day (immediately following this meeting all of the attendees departed directly for IDEX).  The COS met with and most certainly briefed the President, Prime Minister and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince (the de facto Minister of Defense) as IDEX began.   OLSON

OLSON FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D.  1. (S/NF) Summary: During a March 24 meeting with Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) expressed his grave concerns about the Iranian threat to the region.  MbZ said the Iranian response to the Nowruz message was primarily for domestic consumption, but that the Iranian leadership is concerned that dialogue with the West represents a regime threat.  He said Iran would obtain a nuclear weapon unless the regime could be "split from inside" before nuclear capability was achieved.  Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed argued for continued Gulf consultation in conjunction with any U.S. efforts to engage Iran.  (Other topics reported septel.)  End Summary.  NOWRUZ STATEMENT ----------------  2. (S/NF) MbZ began by telling Amb. Holbrooke that Khamenei's response to President's Nowruz statement was designed to send a message to the millions of Iranians who saw the statement on the Internet that there will be no debate on engagement with the United States and/or the West.  MbZ opined that Khamenei had to deliver the message personally as an Ahmedinejad response would have fueled domestic debate.  Commenting that Khamenei was conveying Iran's fundamental lack of trust in the United States, MbZ said the Iranians want an apology "for everything from Carter to Bush."  He added that the uncharacteristic speed of Khamenei's response indicates the extent of the perceived threat that improved relations with the West might represent to the leadership's control over the country. Specifically, the Iranian regime fears the United States will demand the renunciation of its nuclear program, which would be politically impossible.  NUCLEAR WEAPONS A CERTAINTY, UNLESS REGIME FALLS --------------------------------------------- ---  3. (S/NF) MbZ told Holbrooke he was "100 percent" convinced Iran will complete its nuclear weapons program.  He candidly stated his personal belief that negotiations with Iran were irrelevant and a military solution would only delay the program, not derail it.  MbZ said that there was a "third way" between these unacceptable options:  Iran is domestically very fragile, and the only way to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons was to "split them from inside."  4. (S/NF) Turning to his concerns about an armed confrontation, MbZ said war with Iran would only harm the UAE.  He is deeply concerned that the current Israeli government will initiate military action without consultation.  An Israeli attack on Iran would have little impact on Iran's capabilities, but MbZ was certain Iran would respond.  MbZ argued that the leadership believes its own lies, which were "proven" by Iran's success in Basra.  Today's conventional Iranian weapons would target the Gulf, while Iran continues to expand its missile program with the hope of reaching the West.  CONSULT US ----------  5. (S/NF) UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan (AbZ) stressed the importance of a continuation of the P5 plus 1 plus GCC plus 3 coordination on Iran.  AbZ said that such consultation in 2008 "agitated" Iran, but sent a message to Russia and China and European allies that the Gulf is seriously concerned about Iranian hegemony.  Iran's regional hegemony and nuclear program are two issues that the West cannot tackle separately.  AbZ noted that countries in the region ("some friends") are concerned that the United States, especially under the current administration, would engage Iran at the expense of ties with the region.  AbZ said the President's Nowruz message supported this theory.  He concluded, "The more you engage Iran, the more you must engage the Gulf states." (Ambassador Olson's comment:  Abdullah's reference to "friends" was Emirati politesse - the UAE is deeply concerned that we are preparing to trade, and is interpreting the Nowruz greeting in that way.)  6. (SBU) Ambassador Holbrooke has cleared this message. OLSON
S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000736  SIPDIS NOFORN  STATE FOR NEA/FO AND NEA/ARP  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2019 TAGS: PREL EFIN ECON IR AESUBJECT: CROWN PRINCE SOUNDS ALARM ON IRAN  Classified by Ambassador Richard Olson, reasons 1.4 (b, d).  1. (U) This cable contains an action request in para 12.  2. (S/NF) Summary. On July 15, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner joined Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan (MBZ) and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al Nahyan (ABZ) for a dinner covering a range of regional issues.  MBZ expressed serious concern over Iran's regional intentions and pleaded for the U.S. to shorten its decision-making timeline and develop a "plan B." He encouraged the U.S. to clearly communicate 'red lines' to the Iranian Government, on nuclear and regional stability issues, with direct consequences for transgressions.  He painted to a nuclear Iran as an existential threat to the UAE and invoked the well being of his grandchildren while urging the U.S. to act quickly.  MBZ asked for close coordination between the U.S. and UAE to deal with the Iranian threat. End Summary.  3. (S/NF) Secretary Geithner asked the Crown Prince for his views on the situation in the region, particularly in Iran.  Geithner described the U.S. strategy on Iran, including our intention to move forward with multilateral financial sanctions while waiting for Iran to decide on its engagement with the U.S.   He also conveyed appreciation for the important support that UAE provides to other regional trouble spots.  4. (S/NF) MBZ described a nuclear armed Iran as absolutely untenable.  He pointed to Iran's relentless ambitions to restore regional hegemony as evidenced by destabilizing interference in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Palestine.  He believes that 'all hell will break loose' if Iran attains the bomb, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey developing their own nuclear weapons capability and Iran instigating Sunni - Shia conflict throughout the world.  He said Iran is surrounding Israel - driven by ideological conviction - and will threaten Israel's existence should it go nuclear.  At the same time, he described Iran's ambitions as reflecting a desire to restore Persia's great-power status, rather than driven by religious convictions.  5. (S/NF) MBZ differentiated the long term threat posed by Iran from other menacing states like North Korea or Syria.  Where these other regimes were ruled by small cadres of corrupt 'old guard' officials, the Iranian regime has raised its next generation to carry out its designs for hegemony.  As such, the world will be dealing with Iran's destabilizing ambitions for decades.  MBZ assesses that the Iranian regime has emerged from the recent election strife stronger and more resolute.  6. (S/NF) While careful not to suQY.JQoWoRth Iran, MBZ described a near term conventional war with Iran as clearly preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed Iran. Without timely and decisive action by the United States, MBZ believes that Israel will strike Iran, causing Iran to launch missile attacks - including hits on the UAE -  and to unleash terror attacks worldwide. In his view, 'the map of the Middle East' would change. He expects widespread civilian conflict to erupt as Iran sparks Sunni - Shia violence worldwide (including the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia which he sees as the greatest vulnerability, along with Iraq, in the Arab world).  He speculated that such an event could unfold within six months time and resolved that the UAE is prepared to defend itself.  He believes that an Israeli strike will not be successful in stopping Iran's nuclear program, and therefore we need to plan.  7. (S/NF) Regarding the recent election in Iran, MBZ cautioned that Mir Hossein Musavi is no different than Ahmedinejad when it comes to their nuclear ambitions, 'same goal, different tactic.'  In this respect, he regards Musavi as more dangerous than his competitor, as at least Ahmedinejad was 'an open book.'  He reminded Secretary Geithner that Musavi and his advisors are part of the same group that took the U.S. Embassy in 1979.  8. (S/NF) MBZ questioned Europe's basic understanding of the threat posed by Iran, and wrote off their resolve to deal with the situation.  He was appalled by 'top European diplomats' that were unconcerned by the possibility of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. He shared his theory that Russia was trying to instigate conflict between the U.S. and Iran as a means to weaken the U.S. and drive up oil prices.  He suggested we could use Russia's narrow views to help persuade Russia to join international actions against Iran.  9. (S/NF) MBZ stated that financial sanctions would never be sufficient to stop Iran, but allowed that the U.S. should continue with such measures to demonstrate to the Arab world that we tried everything.  He pledged continued cooperation and support for international sanctions and encouraged further action in the UN and EU, as well as the U.S. 10. (S/NF) MBZ suggested that the key to containing Iran revolves around progress in the Israel/Palestine issue.  He argued that it will be essential to bring Arab public opinion on board in any conflict with Iran and roughly 80% of the public is amenable to persuasion.  To win them over, the U.S. should quickly bring about a two state solution over the objections of the Netanyahu government. He suggested working with moderate Palestinians that support the road map, and forget about the others as there is no time to waste.  11. (S/NF) Foreign Minister ABZ urged the U.S. to make better use of its allies in the region and engage Russia and China in a productive way on this issue wherever possible.  He urged clear and forceful messaging to Iran and more regional gatherings (i.e. P+5+1 and GCC+3) to increase pressure and isolation.  12. (S/NF) ACTION REQUEST: MBZ would like to visit Washington in late July to discuss Iran with President Obama and other senior officials. Treasury and Embassy recommend continuing the dialogue with MBZ as soon as possible.  13. (SBU) This cable has been cleared by Andy Baukol, Department of Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary for International Affairs. GREENE

Summary -------  1.  (S/NF) In a July 20 plenary session of the GSD with a large UAE delegation, accompanied by a smaller session with the UAE Chief of Staff, the immediate focus was largely on Iran.  Participants reiterated the good defense cooperation that the U.S. and UAE enjoy, while noting the need to improve coordination further to deal with real and urgent threats in the region. In this regard, the  UAE put the threat of Iran's potential reaction to a "likely" Israeli attack on its nuclear program at the center of scenarios to be considered. Other issues, to include Yemen, counter-proliferation, Pakistan, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and extremism were also addressed, but even these were often seen through the prism of Iranian intentions.  2.  (S/NF) This message begins with the Chief of Staff's urgent plea on "munitions" to deal with an unpredictable Iran, followed by a synopsis of GSD plenary proceedings.  A list of UAE participants is included at para 20.  End summary.  Chief of Staff Presses for Munitions: Urgent about Iran's unpredictability ------------------------------------  3.  (S/NF) In a brief session with principals only, Chief of Staff Hamad Thani al-Romaithi (who also participated in the MbZ dinner and was on his way to Lebanon later July 20) said the UAE cannot act alone in the region and needs coherent plans -- especially to deal with the unique threat of Iran.  How to deter Iran without provoking it is a challenge.  Ambassador al-Otaiba emphasized how the proximity of the UAE to Iran magnifies the threat perception; the CoS said UAE military planning had to consider worst-case scenarios.  4.  (S/NF) ASD Vershbow said the USG did not disagree with the UAE evaluation of Iran's objectives, but that we need to work to prevent them from achieving those objectives.  Diplomacy is only one tool. The USG wants to help provide the UAE with defensive capabilities and our troop presence here should help act as a deterrent to Iran.  We don't want to signal that we will give up on diplomacy, yet in parallel to that effort we intend to keep the pressure on Iran.  We appreciate the candor of our defense engagement with the UAE.  We are dealing with an unpredictable foe and need to take all precautions.  5.  (S/NF) The CoS said Iran will remain a threat in any case, as its objectives are constant.  He added that if the Israelis strike, Iran may lash out at the UAE and around the Gulf -- one can conceive of many possible scenarios from missile strikes to attacks on isolated islands to the exploitation of 130,000 Iranians living in the UAE. The UAE therefore seeks ongoing support from the region's "main actor," the U.S., and desires close defense coordination.  The UAE's friends in the GCC, on the other hand, are not always realistic in their approach to Iran, he said, citing Arab misinterpretation of "brotherly" Iraqi intentions with regards to Kuwait back in 1990.  6.  (S/NF) ASD Vershbow said that our message to Iran is that threats against our allies will not go unanswered.  We need to be prepared in case deterrence does not work, with the realization that with or without nuclear weapons Iran seeks to be a dominant power in the region.  This is a very interconnected region, asserted the CoS.  "If I was in the Israelis' shoes, I would attack, to reduce the nuclear threat."  The first reaction may be that the Iranians launch missiles against targets in Israel and then the Gulf, he added.  Air Chief Sweidan added that the UAE needs munitions on a tighter timeline than previously assumed -- with urgent needs in 2010, 11, and 12.  He said the UAE Armed Forces could receive munitions from the U.S. inventory and then replenish them later (he supplied the same list of requirements as was relayed some months ago, noting that they had only received a "political" answer to that inquiry thus far).  ABU DHABI 00000744  002 OF 004    7.  (S/NF) The CoS was appreciative of Patriot deployments, progress on command and control systems, and movement toward more effective shared early warning, but lamented that other pieces of the air defense puzzle require immediate attention.  Ambassador al-Otaiba reiterated the need to "borrow from U.S. inventories" to meet urgent timelines.  A/S Vershbow said we were leaning far forward for the UAE on THAAD, for example, and would continue to look into opportunities to assist, including filling gaps before UAE-purchased systems were delivered.  8.  (S/NF) Highlighting the importance of close defense coordination, the CoS noted that in the event of an attack the UAE may have no time to react.  Taking the fight to Iran may require "passing over U.S. aircraft carriers," for example, so we need to be in lock-step at all phases of preparation and operation.  Introductory remarks --------------------  9.  (C) The Plenary session of the U.S.-UAE Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) convened July 20 at the Armed Forces Officers' Club, with newly promoted Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ali Hamad Subaih al-Kaabi stating that the "small but significant" Gulf region makes a large contribution to global peace and development and seeks enhanced cooperation with the U.S.  He cited UAE troops in Afghanistan, U.S. use of UAE bases, a robust intelligence exchange, strong counter-terror efforts, and improved border control as evidence that the UAE shares common goals with the U.S.  Citing the "high importance" of strong relations among GCC members, he thanked the U.S. for its role in the defense relationship and wanted to learn more about U.S. strategies vis-a-vis Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine.  10.  (C) Assistant Secretary of Defense Vershbow, leading the U.S. team along with Assistant State of State for Political-Military AffairsShapiro, expressed confidence in the strength and future of the bilateral relationship, anchored by common strategic interests. Recounting shared priorities, he noted that the GSD was being taken to a new level as we seek strategic synergy in facing real threats like Iran -- which we are obligated to defend against.  He called for a more multi-lateral approach to counter-proliferation and cited the need to prepare missile defenses.  He lauded the UAE decision to host LEADING EDGE 2009 and cited the 123 agreement with the U.S. as the high standard on civil nuclear cooperation.  The responsible drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq also calls for continued UAE support, he emphasized, as Iraq seeks to assume responsibility for its own security and integrate into the region.  The UAE's advanced fighter squadron, growing air defense net, participation in RED FLAG, and leadership of CTF 152 are all indications of a maturing defense capability.  11.  (C)  A/S Shapiro emphasized the USG desire to ensure regional stability, counter extremism, curb WMD proliferation, and tackle the inter-related challenges of the region holistically.  He focused on the threat from Iran, stressing that the USG was attempting a diplomatic solution -- if possible -- and would proceed in consultation with our friends in the region.  Recounting the basic components of our Iraq policy, he also highlighted the need to strengthen the institutions of government in Lebanon and build capacity within the Palestinian Authority.  UAE offers threat analysis: all Iran ------------------------------------  12.  (S) The UAE's presentation of the primary regional threat assessed that Iran's leadership "genuinely believes that it has emerged victorious from its clash with the U.S.," with gains made in Iraq, an expanding "Shi'a tide" in the region, an ongoing nuclear program, missile modernization, and continued provocation of resistance in Gaza.  While Israel was able to neutralize to some degree threats on its flanks in Lebanon (2006) and Gaza (2008/9),  ABU DHABI 00000744  003 OF 004   Iran's main goals of regional influence were not inhibited.  The UAE assessment continued that Israel may act on its perception that only "extreme" (and unlikely) UNSC action or unilateral Israeli military action can slow Iran's nuclear goals.  As Iran continues to reject a political solution, the UAE must prepare for the fallout should Israel act on its fears.  With that, the briefer introduced a slide on Iran's capabilities, with missile sites in the south of Iran and concentric circles showing their likely range all covering UAE territory.  13.  (S) Iranian promotion of "Shi'ism," coupled with sleeper cells in the region, magnify the threat articulated by the UAE.  If attacked, it may seek to obstruct shipping in the Gulf and control (more) islands over which it does not have legitimate sovereignty. Working in alliance with al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Iraqi Shi'a, Iran is poised to do damage of an unpredictable nature if/when provoked. In sum, Iran continued as the traditional focus of the threat briefing offered by the UAE at GSD sessions.  Other regional concerns noted in lesser detail included Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab-Israeli conflict, terrorism, and piracy.  Strategic Cooperation ---------------------  14.  (C) In further briefings, the UAE team highlighted good operational cooperation with the U.S. and offered a review of the maturing Critical National Infrastructure Agency (CNIA) which is taking charge of security on land, along the coast, and off shore -- with an initial focus on Abu Dhabi but an intent to serve as a federal agency.  The U.S. Coast Guard and NYPD were cited as partners in the growing CNIA mission, with a U.S. promise of first-time "Nuclear Security Training" in the near future.  15.  (S) The UAE delegation received  a draft "UAE National Defense Strategy and U.S.-UAE Comprehensive Defense Strategy" document outlining key priorities in the defense relationship (a document proposed by UAE Ambassador to Washington Yousef al-Otaiba).  Without immediate comment on the substance of the USG draft, al-Kaabi said the UAE would reply via embassy channels and looked forward to continuing the dialogue.  Q on Iran, Yemen ------------------  16.  (C) When the floor was open to general discussion, two topics dominated:  Iran and Yemen.  The UAE asked whether the USG had any new information since the December 2007 NIE regarding Iran's nuclear weaponization program; the U.S. team noted that a new estimate was in progress but it was premature to comment.  The DMI representative also noted that Iran exploits crises for its own advantage, making the defusing of crises like Palestine and Lebanon imperative if we are to keep Iran in check.  In the case of Palestine, he added optimistically, it is time to "cut to the chase" and deal with final status issues; Lebanon is also ripe for progress, he suggested, without a drawn out process.  17.  (S) On Yemen, the UAE said it shared a U.S. concern that a "failed state" could emerge on the Arabian Peninsula, with terrorist partners and Iranian influence further poisoning the mix.  A collapsed Yemen "gives us Afghanistan," said Commander of the Air Force and Air Defense Major General Hamad bin Suweidan al-Qamzi, and then it presents a long-term threat to the region.  He said the UAE was coordinating economic development support for Yemen while also trying to assist with political reconciliation.  He noted the dangers of "another Somalia."  ASD Vershbow hoped the UAE could help secure a unified GCC approach to Yemen, as time is running out on the seccession question and Yemen cannot afford a "two front" war with both seccesionists and the Al-Houthi insurgency.  In a brief discussion of Pakistan, all agreed that Islamabad needs to focus resources to fight insurgency rather than obsessing with India as its potential military foe.   ABU DHABI 00000744  004 OF 004   Positive Conclusions --------------------  18.  (C) Enhanced U.S.-UAE cooperation to counter troublesome financial flows and cash smuggling -- solidified during a recent visit by Treasury Secretary Geithner -- was noted by the Charge as another area of productive engagement.  Both sides also put in very positive words about the role of the Air Warfare Center which has become a proud center of excellence for the region.  19.  (S) In closing, al-Kaabi raised Iran yet again, noting that its leadership is not likely to change fundamentally and therefore the threat is likely to continue.  He looked forward to ongoing discussion of the defense strategy discussed earlier as we continue to pursue a common vision.  20.

(S) Summary: Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ, also Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and de facto defense chief) hosted a July 19 executive session of the Gulf Security Dialogue in Abu Dhabi (July 20 plenary with UAE uniformed officers reported septel).  The U.S. delegation was led by Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow and Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro.  MbZ called for advanced U.S.-UAE joint military coordination and faster delivery of FMS items to respond to a worst-case scenario in Iran.  As with other senior U.S. officials (but with increasing alarm and a shortening time frame), MbZ focused on the Iranian threat and his belief that an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran is likely in a matter of months.  ASD Vershbow assured MbZ of the U.S. commitment to UAE security; A/S Shapiro relayed that this visit was his first since taking his new position - reflecting the importance we place on the relationship.  Discussions also centered on UAE military and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan and the peace process.   End summary.  2. (SBU) Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) hosted a working dinner with U.S. Gulf Security Dialogue delegation the evening of July 19.  The U.S. Delegation was led by Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow and included RADM William Payne, Ambassador, and DCM.  The UAE was represented by Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Hamad Thani al-Rumaithi, Ambassador to the U.S. Yousef al-Otaiba, Under Secretary of the Crown Prince's Court Mohamed al-Mazrouei, Deputy Chief of Staff Ali Hamad al-Kaabi and Air Force Chief Mohammed Swaidan al-Qamzi.  Joint Planning for Worst-Case Scenario in Iran --------------------------------------------- -  3. (S) In a three-hour working dinner, MbZ focused primarily on his overarching concern -- the threat from Iran, stressing as he has with other senior U.S. officials that U.S. engagement with Iran will ultimately fail and that he fears a surprise (Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran) in a shorter timeframe than USG estimates (he fears it could happen this year).  ASD Vershbow assured MbZ of the U.S. commitment to UAE security; A/S Shapiro relayed that his trip to the UAE was his first since taking on his new position, reflecting the importance we place on the relationship.  4. (S/NF) MbZ reiterated his belief that an Israeli pre-emptive strike against Iran was increasingly likely, saying he was convinced the Netanyahu government was prepared to act against Iran, and that he agreed with Israeli intelligence assessments regarding how close Tehran is to achieving its nuclear ambitions.  The Iranian response to a pre-emptive strike, predicted MbZ, would be attacks on U.S. allies in the region, foremost among them the UAE; Iran may also unleash terrorist cells against western interests around the world. ASD Vershbow explained that the USG assessment differed in timeframe -- we do not anticipate military confrontation with Iran before the end of 2009 -- stressing, however, that denying Iran's nuclear ambitions and stemming its efforts to achieve regional hegemony were foremost among U.S. international security concerns.  5. (S) In response to MbZ's position that ultimately engagement efforts with Iran would fail, both ASD and A/S  made clear than while the USG continues to press for a diplomatic solution, the offer of engagement is not opened-ended and will not come at the expense of Gulf security.  ABU DHABI 00000754  002 OF 004    6. (S) Referring to the Iran Region Presence Office (IRPO) in Dubai, MbZ asked "how's that office doing?"  He did not demonstrate any particular concern or sensitivity regarding IRPO activities in UAE. MbZ said that the Iranian regime was in trouble internally and would move swiftly to oppress post-election opposition.  As for Rafsanjani, MbZ said he was a "survivor" who would not succeed in a leadership bid because he will not act unless he is one-hundred percent sure he will win.  Again turning to his primary security concern, MbZ suggested that Tehran would likely accelerate its nuclear program to draw attention away from its internal weakness and to foment nationalism among its citizenry.  "Time is not on our side", he said, hinting that a move should be made against Iran and "the sooner the better."  Russia ------  7. (C)ASD Vershbow briefed MbZ on the positive outcome of POTUS's recent talks in Moscow.  MbZ said that he had met with Putin in June and he did not believe Russia saw a nuclearized Iran as a challenge to its interests, nor did Putin appreciate the threat of regional proliferation in response to an Iranian bomb.  He encouraged the U.S. to continue to press the Russians saying he believed if the Russians came over to our side, (with regard to tougher sanctions), the Chinese would follow.  MbZ said his he would travel in late July to Beijing, where he will surely press the Chinese on Iran.  ASD Vershbow suggested he urge the Chinese to send Iran a message by diversifying its oil imports away from Iran.  Afghanistan - Neighbors Not Doing Enough ----------------------------------------  8. (S/NF) MbZ complained that Arab regimes are not doing enough to help in Afghanistan.  He said that as of one month ago, he surveyed the region and found that only Oman had funded its Tokyo conference pledge of $2 million.  He singled out Saudi Arabia and Qatar in particular for not doing their part, saying that the Saudis clearly did not see how important it was to their own interests.  9. (S/NF) MbZ criticized other regional leaders for playing both sides and for "dating" Iran.  MbZ compared the current situation to pre-WWII Europe saying, "Ahmedinejad is Hitler," and neighboring capitals believe erroneously that they can prevent Iranian retaliation by playing nice or signing agreements with Tehran.  "They think the are backing the winning horse," MbZ explained, emphasizing that if they think that by appeasing Iran they will avoid Iranian retaliation "then they are seriously mistaken, Sir."  National Defense Strategy -------------------------  10. (S) Throughout the discussions, MbZ repeatedly called for coordinated military planning for the worst-case scenario of an unpredictable Iranian response to an Israeli strike, stressing that U.S.-UAE preparations must begin now well before commencement of hostilities.  Both sides agreed that improved coordination was a good idea, with ASD Vershbow utilizing the opportunity to push for a UAE national defense strategy.  (Note: GSD July 20 plenary meeting reported septel.  End Note.)  Pakistan - 14 Additional PUMAs ------------------------------  11. (C) Passing a letter from Secretary Clinton thanking the UAE for its transfer of 14 U.S.-origin PUMA helicopters to Pakistan, A/S Shapiro thanked MbZ for the UAEG's partnership and regional leadership in providing assistance to Pakistan as well as its long-term participation in the coalition in Afghanistan.  MbZ updated the delegation on delivery status, saying that 10 of the promised 14  ABU DHABI 00000754  003 OF 004   had been delivered and the remaining 4 would shortly follow.  He added that efforts were underway to find and purchase additional helicopters, announcing (for the first time that we have heard this) the UAE's intentions to provide Pakistan with an additional 14 PUMAs.  Humanitarian Aid for CT ----------------------- 12. (C) In the context of defeating AQ in Afghanistan and Pakistan, MbZ called for Arab and Muslim regimes to do more to stem terrorist financing, whether it means closing down charities, business interests, "whatever is necessary."  He also pointed to the zealousness of Arab fighters vice Afghani nationals.  Nine-five percent of Arab fighters go to Afghanistan knowing they are going to die for ideological reasons.  Afghan nationals, on the other hand, are more practical.  "This makes one of them [Arabs] more valuable to AQ than ten or more Afghan fighters."  Afghanis, MbZ pointed out, have tribes, families, homes -- therefore the best way to counter local extremism in Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent Pakistan, is to improve the quality of life.  13. (SBU) MbZ described UAE humanitarian commitments of $300 million to build "model villages" in Afghanistan, complete with housing, hospitals and schools.  He invited the USG to join the UAE, Germany and France in this effort.  A/S Shapiro stressed the urgency of the displaced persons crisis in the Swat region of Pakistan, suggesting the UAE consider housing aid in this region.  MbZ replied "Why not? We will try to help wherever needed."  MbZ on Pakistani Leadership ---------------------------  14. (S/NF) MbZ shared his assessment of the current Pakistani leadership saying President "Zardarni is dirty but not dangerous," while Prime Minister Sharif is "dangerous but not dirty -- this is Pakistan.  Sharif cannot be trusted to honor his promises.  MbZ continued that a new personality may emerge but for the time being the UAE position was to play a helpful role by supporting the PM.  Lebanon - Support for LAF and PM Hariri ---------------------------------------  15. (C) ASD Vershbow reiterated our request that the UAEG assist the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) by funding the purchase and transfer of some of 56 U.S.-origin tanks from Jordan to Lebanon, noting our appreciation of the UAE's earlier funding of the first 10 tanks. This would help capitalize on the positive outcome of the elections and help reduce Hezbollah's (and Iran's) influence in Lebanon. Promising to look into what the UAE could do to help with this matter, MbZ asked if we had made the same request to Doha.  ASD replied that we had and that he would do so again when he arrived in Qatar July 20.  16. (C) Reiterating his favored theme of the generation gap in regional leadership (UAE having already passed the baton to the younger generation), MbZ praised Lebanese PM Saad Hariri, saying he was a good man.  "He feels very threatened at the moment (presumably by the Syrian regime), and it is important we do not lose him."  A/S Shapiro agreed, pointing to U.S. security assistance as proof of our concern and suggested that the UAE support U.S. efforts to strengthen Lebanese government institutions as the best opportunity to build GOL stability and security.  July 18 Nasrallah Speech ------------------------  17. (S) MbZ pointed to Hezbollah SYG Hassan Nasrallah's July 18 speech, saying he believed it reflected a change in Hezbollah's tone due to calculations that its Iranian backers were currently in a weakened state post-Presidential elections.  MbZ said that Nasrallah is likely suffering from decreased financial support, at least for  ABU DHABI 00000754  004 OF 004   the next six months.  Behavior Change in Syria - I Think Not --------------------------------------  18. (S/NF) Vershbow pointed to recent progress with Syria on border control issues to stem the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq as a small step forward in effort at eliciting behavioral change from Damascus.  MbZ showed no confidence that Syria could be separated from the Iranian camp.  "If you want my opinion," replied MbZ, "I think not."  He advised that Syria had a lot of options and that, judging from past behavior, the regime would continue hedging on key regional issues (Iran, support for Hezbollah, peace process) for the foreseeable future.  Praise for Bahraini Crown Prince --------------------------------  19. (C) MbZ said that a two-state solution was the only option for solving the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  MbZ praised the Bahraini Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa for his "courageous" (July 17) editorial in the Washington Post (ref B), commenting that not enough Arab countries we on the right side of this issue.  20. (U) ASD Vershbow and A/S Shapiro cleared this message.
S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000862   NOFORN  DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR SRAP, S/SEMEP AND NEA.  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/2018 TAGS: PREL AESUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH SHAYKH MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED  Classified by Ambassador Richard Olson, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Mr President:  Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayed is looking forward to renewing your acquaintanceship, established during his 2006 call on you.  --------------------------------------------- ---- MbZ - The Man --------------------------------------------- ----  2.  (C) Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, or MbZ in USG speak, is the man who runs the United Arab Emirates.  Officially he is the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (the most important principality of the seven emirate confederation) and his only federal title is Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; in fact he is the key decision maker on national security issues.  He will make deferential noises about his "boss" (elder half-brother President Khalifa, a distant and uncharismatic personage), but we assess that he has authority in all matters except for final decisions on oil policy and major state expenditures.  3.  (C) Aged 47, MbZ is a leader not just in the UAE, but more broadly in the Middle East, where he is seen as a particularly dynamic member of the generation succeeding the geriatric cases who have dominated the region for decades.  He is a reformer, actively seeking to improve the life of his citizens and the UAE's future through better education and health care, and through economic diversification, including investments in clean energy to prepare his citizenry for a post-hydrocarbon future.  He is proud of the fact that despite having had the option of life of privilege, he rose through the ranks of the UAE Armed Forces, earning his wings as a helicopter pilot and retains a common touch that appeals to Emiratis.  --------------------------------------------- ---- MbZ and the Bilateral Relationship --------------------------------------------- ----  4.  (C) MbZ has staked his reputation, and his country's future, on its relationship with the United States, especially since 1990, when the UAE leadership saw that the United States was prepared to shed blood in the interests of preserving international order and stability in the Gulf.  Since that formative experience, MbZ has built armed forces (especially his Air Force) that are closely aligned with the US.  He is also a proponent of close economic, commercial, and where possible political ties with the US.  He has generally tried to support us where he thinks we have been right (Afghanistan), but also where he thinks we have pursued misguided policies (Iraq).  MbZ recognizes that partnership with the US is fundamental to the UAE's continued success, but he also knows that the relationship is controversial among his people, and that if the US is perceived as an unreliable protector, his own power base will erode.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Iran --------------------------------------------- ----  5.  (C) MbZ sees Iran as the primary external threat to the UAE and his regime.  To his eyes, Tehran's threatening rhetoric, dominance by proxy, and pursuit of nuclear weapons is reminiscent of Saddam in 1990.  Moreover, the confrontations with Iran during the late 1980s tanker wars, long forgotten in the West, are vividly remembered here.  MbZ is probably the most passionately anti-Iran of the Arab leaders, and the UAE's position is solidly with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan in seeing the principal threat to the region as coming from Iran. MbZ is particularly concerned at the divisions among the Gulf Arabs, and sees Qatar's and Oman's decision to accommodate, rather than challenge, Iranian power as troubling.  6.  (S/NF) While MbZ is a hard liner on Iran, there are accommodationists within his own system, especially in Dubai, where the Ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (Prime Minister of the UAE) takes a position that is much closer to Qatar's.  For this reason, and because of the basic disparity in size and power between the UAE and Iran, the Emiratis prefer to be seen as quietly supporting a hard-line US position, rather than staking out their own views.  MbZ is skeptical that US engagement with Iran will be successful in reversing Iranian positions on nuclear program, and believes that a policy of engagement puts him in an awkward position, both domestically and internationally.  He will welcome thinking on next steps on sanctions.  7.  (S/NF) Regarding the nuclear issue, MbZ believes that the logic of war now dominates the region.  He regularly expresses his belief that Israel will launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, most likely within next six months.  This reflects his own assessment of the Netanyahu Government, but also, probably, what Israelis are telling UAE in their private exchanges.  For this reason, one of MbZ's highest priorities is to finalize his integrated air defense system (including THAAD and Patriots) and advance bilateral contingency planning with the US.  Because of Qatari and Omani wobbliness, he is uncomfortable with multilateral (GCC) military solutions.  MbZ may float the idea of extending the US nuclear umbrella to the Gulf as a way of shoring up an anti-Iran coalition, and preventing a regional arms race.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Israel and the Arabs --------------------------------------------- ----  8.  (S/NF) MbZ's pre-occupation with Iran (and his secondary concern about Islamic fundamentalism) lead him to have a strategic view of the region that is curiously close to the Israeli one.  But domestic politics flow the other way, and he feels constrained in what he can say publicly.  Also, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the UAE still feels a need to hide behind Arab League and GCC consensus, and in particular behind Saudi Arabia (even when, as is now the case, bilateral relations with the Kingdom are rocky).  9.  (S/NF)  We should press MbZ to expend political capital in resolving the century old Arab-Israeli conflict.  The issue cries out for leadership in the Arab world, not least so that the common interests of moderate Arabs and Israelis in containing Iran can find a political expression.  So far, MbZ has not been prepared to run real risks in this area, but we should press him to.  He appreciates the bold steps you have taken, and expects to be asked for help in this area.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Afghanistan-Pakistan --------------------------------------------- ----  10.  (C) The discussion on Afghanistan and Pakistan should be an easy one.  The UAE has played a useful role since 2001, having deployed Special Forces there since 2003, and recently sending a Battalion sized task force during the elections.  MbZ tried to organize a pan-Arab force, but could not overcome the resistance of Moroccans and Tunisians to send troops.  In Pakistan, the UAE has been supportive of Zardari and played a very useful role both as donor and politically as one of the key members of the friends of Pakistan grouping.  MbZ agrees on the need to curtail Taliban financing, but is frustrated by our seeming inability to generate actionable intelligence.  --------------------------------------------- ---- CT/CP Cooperation --------------------------------------------- ----  11. (C) The UAE has emerged as one of our principal partners in CT Cooperation through intelligence channels, having rounded up a number of cells over the past few years, and is moving toward cooperation externally as well.  In the counterproliferation area, the UAE has interdicted 20 shipments over the past two years, including within the past few days, seizing North Korean systems bound for Iran. Domestic Export Controls have lagged somewhat, but the UAEG's bureaucratic structure for implementing its export control laws is finally emerging.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Conclusion --------------------------------------------- ----  12.  (C) MbZ views himself as one our closest partners in the Middle East, and is keen to build on what has been an important aspect of his life's work, a good relationship with the US.  From my perspective, our relationship with the UAE is one the most promising and productive in the region.  OLSON

(S) Summary: This cable responds to Ref A request for evaluations of third-country reactions to possible U.S. engagement with Iran.  Jordan's leaders believe such engagement would reward regional hardliners while undermining Arab moderates - without convincing Iran to cease its support for terrorism, end its nuclear program or drop its hegemonic aspirations.  Jordanian officials argue that the best way to counter Iran's ambitions is to weaken the salience of its radicalism on the Arab street by fulfilling the promise of a "two-state solution," resolving other Arab-Israeli disputes, and making sure that Iraq's political and security institutions are not overwhelmed by Iranian influence when the U.S. drawdown is complete.  If U.S.-Iran engagement does proceed in earnest, Jordan hopes to be closely consulted in advance and for its interests to be taken into account.  End Summary.  Beware the Iranian Tentacles ... and Cut Them Off --------------------------------------------- ----  2.  (S) The metaphor most commonly deployed by Jordanian officials when discussing Iran is of an octopus whose tentacles reach out insidiously to manipulate, foment, and undermine the best laid plans of the West and regional moderates.  Iran's tentacles include its allies Qatar and Syria, Hizballah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian territories, an Iraqi government sometimes seen as supplicant to Tehran, and Shia communities throughout the region.  While Jordanian officials doubt dialogue with the U.S. will convince Iran to withdraw its "tentacles," they believe they can be severed if Iran is deprived of hot-button issues that make it a hero to many on the Arab street, such as its championing of the Palestinian cause.  3.  (C) According to the GOJ analysis, Iran's influence derives from the perception that Tehran is able to "deliver" while moderates are not.  The main failure of moderates as cited by radicals is ongoing Palestinian suffering and dispossession despite an international consensus favoring a viable, independent Palestinian state living peacefully next to Israel.  The MFA's Deputy Director of the Arab and Middle East Affairs Department, Muwaffaq Ajlouni, put it this way: "Iran is not welcomed in the Arab world, but it is taking advantage of helpless people."  From Jordan's perspective, the U.S. would benefit from pressing Israel to proceed to final status negotiations, which would garner Arab support to deal with shared security concerns about Iran.  4.  (S) In Lebanon, the GOJ fears Iran's Hizballah proxy has been given too much rope and could be poised to increase its political influence during upcoming parliamentary elections. The King sees the Lebanon-Israel War of 2006 as having benefited Iran and Hizballah, by allowing a Sunni Arab street enamored of "resistance" to see past its suspicions of the Shia.  And then-Foreign Minister Salah Al-Bashir in late 2008 described the spring 2009 vote as "when we will know who won last May," referring to the outcome of the Doha Accords that put an end to Lebanese infighting.  Much like with the Palestinian issue, Jordanian leaders have argued that the only way to pull the rug out from under Hizballah - and by extension their Iranian patrons - would be for Israel to hand over the disputed Sheba'a Farms to Lebanon.  With Hizballah lacking the "resistance to occupation" rationale for continued confrontation with Israel, it would lose its raison d'etre and probably domestic support.  5.  (S) In Iraq, signs of growing security and political stability over the past year in particular have served somewhat to calm Jordanian nerves about Iran's interference. The King and others have cited indications that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki is showing himself to be a national rather than a parochial or Iranian-controlled leader.  During the U.S.-Jordan Political Dialogue in November 2008, FM Bashir noted that the Iraqi government had a "tendency to appease Iran," but he saw increased Jordanian (and Sunni Arab) diplomatic engagement with Baghdad as a potential bulwark against Iran (Ref B).  Positive trends notwithstanding, many of our Jordanian interlocutors stress that the U.S. should leave Iraq only when it "makes sense," and thereby avoid a political and security vacuum that could be easily filled by Iran (Ref C).   Prepare for Iran to Disappoint ------------------------------  6.  (S) Jordan's leaders are careful not to be seen as dictating toward the U.S., but their comments betray a powerful undercurrent of doubt that the United States knows how to deal effectively with Iran.  Foreign Minister Nasser Joudeh has suggested the Iranians would be happy to let talks with the U.S. continue for ten years without moving them forward, believing that they can benefit from perceived acceptance after years of isolation without paying a price.  7.  (S) Upper House President Zeid Rifai has predicted that dialogue with Iran will lead nowhere, arguing that if the U.S., the EU, and the Arab states agree that under no circumstances should Iran be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon, military force becomes the only option.  "Bomb Iran, or live with an Iranian bomb.  Sanctions, carrots, incentives won't matter," was how he put it to visiting NEA DAS David Hale in November.  While Rifai judged a military strike would have "catastrophic impact on the region," he nonetheless thought preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons would pay enough dividends to make it worth the risks (Ref D).  8.  (C) Speaking to PolOffs in early February 2009, Director of the Prime Minister's Political Office Khaled Al-Qadi noted that the Gaza crisis had allowed Iranian interference in inter-Arab relations to reach unprecedented levels.  He urged the U.S. to "understand the history," explaining that "after the Israelis, the Iranians are the smartest.  They know where they are going and what they are doing."  He doubted there would be any diplomatic breakthrough before Iran's June elections, partly because Iranian pragmatists cannot be practical due to religious and ideological considerations. He hoped any dialogue would be aimed at weakening hardliners, many of whom believe their "Great Satan" rhetoric.  Talk If You Must, But Don't Sell Us Out ---------------------------------------  9.  (S) If direct U.S.-Iran talks must happen, the Jordanian leadership insists it not be at the expense of Arab interests, particularly those of moderates like Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority.  Furthermore, they worry that engagement will set off a stampede of Arab states looking to get ahead of the curve and reach their own separate peace with Tehran.  King Abdullah counseled Special Envoy George Mitchell in February that direct U.S. engagement with Iran at this time would just deepen intra-Arab schisms and that more "countries without a backbone" would defect to the Iranian camp.  The Prime Ministry's Qadi has assessed that Iran sought to "transform the Israeli-Arab conflict into an Islamic-Israeli conflict" and that this strategy was already working with Syria and Qatar.  Even more conspiratorially, then-FM Bashir in September 2008 highlighed Arab fears to a visiting CODEL that the United States and the West would allow Iran to play a hegemonic role in Iraq and throughout the region in exchange for giving up its nuclear program (Ref E).  10.  (S) Asked late last year whether he advocated engaging Iran or working against its interests without engagement, the King told visiting U.S. Senators that U.S. should undertake both approaches concurrently but that engagement needs to be done "smartly" by setting benchmarks for behavior (Ref F). International Affairs Director at the Royal Court Jafar Hassan on April 1 operationalized Jordan's position as follows: the U.S. must not only consult its friends in the region, but declare that it is doing so publicly as a signal to Iran that the Arabs are full parties to the U.S. policy review.  He called for the U.S. and the Arabs to work together to determine what deliverables are required from Iran, what subjects are appropriate for discussion, and also to set clear redlines.  (Note: Hassan said Jordan was trying to work with its friends in the region to develop a joint-Arab strategy, but that this has yet to materialize. End Note.)  11.  (S) Comment: Believing the U.S. is predisposed toward engagement with Iran, Jordanian officials have avoided forthrightly rejecting such overtures, but they remain anxious that Iran will be the only one to benefit - at their expense.  Given Jordanian skepticism that Iran's regional ambitions can be reined in, they probably see establishing benchmarks as a way to keep U.S.-Iranian engagement limited and short-lived.  Re-engagement could trigger a review of Jordan's relationship with Iran and with Islamic groups like Hamas, with which Jordan held limited security talks last year.  When asked periodically whether by engaging with Hamas, Jordan was undermining PA President Mahmoud Abbas,  official interlocutors simply pointed out that Israel meets with Hamas through Egypt, that Syria and Iran are actively engaged with Hamas, and that Jordan cannot be disengaged.

S E C R E T ANKARA 001472  NOFORN SIPDIS  OSD FOR ASD VERSHBOW FROM AMBASSADOR JEFFREY  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2019 TAGS: PREL PARM PTER TUSUBJECT: SCENESETTER:  YOUR VISIT TO TURKEY  Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (S) Sandy, Glad you'll be able to visit Turkey at this key time. Your short visit will give you an opportunity to engage with key Turkish leaders on, first and foremost in their minds, missile defense.  The Turks are keen to learn more about U.S. plans, in particular what role the U.S. wants/expects Turkey and others in Europe to play.  The Turkish General Staff (TGS) will be interested in our ideas for HLDG reform, even if they may be slow to accept them.  2. (S) You know how broad our agenda is with Turkey.  As you will have a short time in country, I suggest you focus on a few key issues.  Be sure to raise: ------------------ - Missile Defense, with emphasis on how the U.S. will look to several Allies - not just Turkey - for help (para 3) - Repeat our commitment to our intel and other support for strikes against the PKK (para 5-6) - Appreciation for Turkey's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan (para 13) - Float the idea of HLDG reform and ensure Guner knows we expect him in Washington (para 4) - Press for a realistic assessment of Turkey's view of the threat assessment from Iran (para 10)  Watch Out For: --------------- - Pressure for direct U.S. milops against the PKK (paras 11-12) - Conflation of Turkey's exploration of air defense capabilities with our Missile Defense needs (para 3)  Missile Defense ----------------  3. (S) The Turks will appreciate your update on U.S. missile defense plans and in particular will expect you to have specific ideas on how Turkey would contribute to the PAA. While the top-level bureaucrats with whom you will meet will understand the rationale for the PAA and will be ready to explore ways Turkey can help, the political environment for a request to base assets in Turkey is mixed, and Turkey's perception of the Iranian threat to its territory differs from ours.  The GOT continues to tread a fine line in managing its strong relationship with the U.S. and its ties with both the Islamic world and Russia.  The government must be able to demonstrate that any missile defense program is not specifically anti-Iran, nor blatantly pro-Israel.  4. (S) Likewise, it will want to ensure that Russia is not opposed to Turkey's role.  Also important will be clarity on the degree to which this system is a NATO one, under NATO Command and Control (C2).  The PAA would presumably complement Turkey's effort to establish a domestic missile defense capability that would protect Turkey's major population centers.  The PAC-3 has been offered in response to Turkey's air defense tender and you should highlight the system's ability to be interoperable with any future NATO command and control architecture.  HLDG -----  5. (C) You will need to outline U.S. views to streamline and alter the current HLDG format to make it into a more substantive discussion.  The Turks are shy to stray from the status quo; you should emphasize why we feel this change is necessary while underscoring that it is vitally important the DCHOD Guner attend the upcoming HLDG in December, when decisions about future dialogues will be agreed upon.  (We have learned that the new position of TGS number three, a four-star slot held by General Balanli (with a focus on hardware), might get the nod for the HLDG representative. We've told Guner it should be his.)  You should also be prepared for the Turkish General Staff to raise the Shared Defense Vision document, as they await a response to their latest proposed text.  PKK ----  6. (C) Turkey's counter-terrorist efforts against the PKK have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone.  Although the government's Democratic (i.e., Kurdish) Initiative is not yet fully developed, the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic Kurds in southeast Turkey, has dramatically broadened the rights of Kurds to use their own language, and increased educational opportunities as well.  It is our view that the TGS military success against the PKK, supported by our intelligence--sharing operation, has given the civilians the political space to explore this "opening."  Turkish military operations against the PKK continue, however, and on  October 6 Parliament extended the government's mandate to conduct cross-border operations against the PKK in Iraq for another year.  7. (C)  Our 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was a turning point for the bilateral relationship, and President Obama's declaration before the Turkish Parliament of our continuing commitment to support Turkey's fight against the PKK was warmly welcomed.  This cooperation has helped to improve our bilateral relationship across the board.  Turkey's military leaders value this intelligence and the advice our military leaders give them.  Our work has made it difficult for PKK terrorists to use northern Iraq as a safe haven.  Turkish causalities are still occurring, however, and an increasing proportion are from IEDs.  Due to pressure on Chief of Staff General Basbug and the Turkish General Staff (TGS) to "finish off" the PKK this year, the government wants and has requested direct U.S. kinetic action against the PKK; we have refused this request to date due to our own rules of engagement.  The GOT has also requested the sale of armed MQ-9/Reaper UAVs, which will be a challenge to fulfill (see para 10).  Northern Iraq --------------  8. (C) Turkey will not consider any alternative to the political  unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, but has become more flexible on how it engages "the local authorities of northern Iraq" (how Turkey refers officially to the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG)).  Turkey's policy remains focused on the government in Baghdad, but its outreach to the KRG is expanding.  This outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of Turkish products and investments in the KRG's healthy economy.  It is also tied to turkey's new opening to its own Kurds, by far the biggest and most controversial domestic political issue here.  9. (S) The U.S.-Turkey-Iraq Tripartite Security talks continue regularly and a new Tripartite operational office in Erbil, established to share counter-PKK intelligence was established over the summer.  The Turks remain shy to share data; they are not convinced that they can trust Iraqi/Kurdish individuals to keep information concerning operations secret.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction.  Turkish military officials have become more strident in their calls for KRG officials to take action against the PKK.  U.S. Drawdown through Turkey -----------------------------  10. (S) Habur Gate and the Incirlik Cargo Hub -- vital to our sustainment operations -- could be helpful in our drawdown if other options prove too difficult.  Minister of National Defense Vedci Gonul suggested to Secretary Gates in June that Turkey was ready to agree to the increased use of Incirlik for this purpose.  Using the surface route from Habur Gate to Mediterranean ports (Iskenderun, Mersin) is also worth exploring, and we may be able to involve Turkish commercial shippers in support of the Northern Distribution Network.  We caution that the rough terrain, security environment, and the cantankerous nature of the Turkish government bureaucracy will challenge any U.S. operation.  Nevertheless, we are evaluating these options in cooperation with CENTCOM and EUCOM partners.  Iran ------  11. (C) Turkey understands and partially shares U.S. and international concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements, in part due to its dependence on Iran as an energy supplier and as a trade route to Central Asian markets.  PM Erdogan himself is a particularly vocal skeptic of the U.S. position.  Turkey believes international pressure against Iran only helps to strengthen Ahmadinejad and the hard-liners.  However, it continues to press Iran quietly to accept the P5 plus 1 offer.  The GOT is a strong partner in our non-proliferation efforts, with several significant results.  Politically, Turkey will try to position itself on Iran between wherever we are and where Russia is.  In a pinch or if pressed, the Turks will slant to us.  UAVs and Attack Helicopters ----------------------------  12. (C) Turkey seeks to acquire, on an urgent basis, its own UAV capability.  The administration has made clear at high levels that we support this goal, and Turkey has pending request to acquire armed Reaper UAVs.  Ultimate approval for armed Reapers is complicated due to MTCR obligations and Hill concerns.  However, even if those could be overcome, the delivery pipeline for these systems is long, and Turkey's leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it.  We have not made this commitment to date.  13. (C) Additionally, bad procurement decisions led Turkey to a severe shortage of attack helicopters, desperately needed for its fight against the PKK  Turkey has looked to us to help them bridge the capability gap, asking to purchase additional AH-1W Super Cobra aircraft.  These aircraft are in short supply in our own inventory, but Secretary Gates and VCJCS Cartwright have promised to try to support with request within a few years (four each in 2011, 2012, and 2013).  The Turks took this as an affirmative, and recently started pressing for delivery in 2010 instead of 2011.   Afghanistan/Pakistan ----------------------  14. (C) Turkey has commanded ISAF twice since its inception and will take command of RC-Capital this November. Turkey leads PRT Wardak and plans to open a second PRT in Jawzjan in early 2010.  Turkey has sponsored the "Ankara Process" dialogue, one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between Kabul and Islamabad and is a leading participant in the Friends of Democratic Pakistan.  Turkey pledged significant aid to both countries:  USD 200 million to Afghanistan and USD 100 million to Pakistan.  Because of its culture, history and religious orientation, as well as Foreign Minister Davutoglu's strategic ambition, Turkey is well disposed to act as an agent of the international community's goals in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Constraining Turkey's potential is a lack of resources.  Our conversations with Turkish interlocutors have helped us identify several areas in which Turkey can be of particular help:  education and health, military training and support, economics, counter-narcotics, and trilateral engagement.  (Note:  Turkey will not support any CT operations in Afghanistan.  They do not believe there is a NATO/ISAF mandate to engage in these operations, and they additionally have national caveats preventing them from participating in NATO/ISAF CT operations.  The GOT also believes that ISAF should not/not be engaged in the counter-narcotics fight, believing that foreign fighters who engage in this fight just produces antipathy against foreign forces in the local population.  I do, however, believe the GOT are willing to engage the training of Afghan security forces.)   Caucasus --------  15. (C) Turkey seeks to develop itself as a regional power and recognizes that the Caucasus region, stymied in its growth by frozen conflicts, could turn to Turkey for develop.  The signing of the Protocol document in Zurich on October 10 was a landmark for the region, and should serve as a starting point for establishing bilateral relations and, ultimately, the opening of its closed border.  Nevertheless, future relations will still be heavily linked to the 1915 "genocide" issue and the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Turkey consistently warns that any U.S. determination of the events of 1915 as "genocide" would set off a political firestorm in Turkey, and the devastating effect on our bilateral relationship -- including political, military, and commercial aspects -- would be unavoidable.   Political Environment ----------------------  16. (C) PM Erdogan's Islamist-leaning Justice and Development (AK) Party is squarely in the driver's seat, but fears an erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist parties.  Civilian-military relations remain complex.  Chief of Staff General Basbug has worked out a modus vivendi with PM Erdogan, but the long-running struggle between Turkey's secularists (with the Army as its champion) and Islamists (represented by the government) naturally puts them at odds. Erdogan has the clear upper hand, a fact with which Basbug has seemingly learned to live.  Alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both Erdogan and Basbug and their respective underlings.  Israel -------  17. (C) While the Foreign Ministry and the Turkish General Staff agree with us that a strong Turkey-Israel relationship is essential for regional stability, PM Erdogan has sought to shore up his domestic right political flank at the expense of this relationship.  His outburst at Davos was the first in a series of events the results of which we and his staff have sought to contain.  The latest of these was Exercise Anatolian Eagle.  Erdogan canceled Israel's participation hours before the exercise was to begin.  With an Israeli strike - across Turkish airspace - against targets in Iran a possibility, Erdogan decided he could not afford the political risk of being accused of training the forces which would carry out such a raid.  Through some remarkable work with Allies and with the inter-agency, we engineered a public "postponement" of the international portion of the exercise, but the relationship has begun to sour.

Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4(b,d)1. (C) During an October 26 call on the Ambassador, Israeli Ambassador Gabby Levy registered concern over the recent deterioration in his country's bilateral relations with Turkey and the conviction that the relationship's decline is attributable exclusively to Prime Minister Erdogan. Levy said Foreign Minister Davutoglu had relayed a message to him through the visiting Czech foreign minister that things will get better. He had also fielded messages from senior civil servants, xxxxx urging him to weather quietly Erdogan's harsh public criticisms of Israel. The latter claimed Erdogan's repeated angry references to the humanitarian situation in Gaza are for domestic political consumption only.2. (C) Levy dismissed political calculation as a motivator for Erdogan's hostility, arguing the prime minister's party had not gained a single point in the polls from his bashing of Israel. Instead, Levy attributed Erdogan's harshness to deep-seated emotion: He's a fundamentalist. He hates us religiously and his hatred is spreading. Levy cited a perceived anti-Israeli shift in Turkish foreign policy, including the GoT's recent elevation of its relations with Syria and its quest for observer status in the Arab League.3. (C) Comment: Our discussions with contacts both inside and outside of the Turkish government on Turkey's deteriorating relations with Israel tend to confirm Levy's thesis that Erdogan simply hates Israel. xxxxx discusses contributing reasons for Erdogan's tilt on Iran/Middle East isues, but antipathy towards Israel is a factor.JEFFREYVisit Ankara's Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.s gov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turkey

Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4 (b,d)  1. (C) Summary:  During an October 21 meeting with MFA Undersecretary Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged Prime Minister Erdogan's recent dismissal of international community allegations that Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons as "gossip."  The Ambassador emphasized Iran will be the single most important topic when Erdogan and POTUS meet in Washington December 7.  In contrast to Erdogan, President Gul November 2 pressed Iran to be transparent with IAEA inspectors.  We will urge Gul and senior Turkish bureuacrats to curb Erdogan's damaging defense of Iran's nuclear activities.  End Summary  2. (C) During an October 21 meeting with MFA Undersecretary Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged PM Erdogan's public statement, made the previous day while he was in Tehran, dismissing allegations of Iran's intent to acquire nuclear weapons as "gossip."  Holding a copy of President Obama's Pittsburgh Summit comdemnation of Iraq's nuclear ambitions, the Ambassador asked Sinirlioglu if "this was the 'gossip'" to which Erdogan had referred.  The Ambassador emphasized that Erdogan's statement made Turkey vulnerable to international community criticism should Iran balk on IAEA inspection of its Qom reprocessing facility or second-party reprocessing of its low-enriched uranium stockpile.  Erdogan was, in effect, allowing the Iranians to infer a weakening of the international community consensus against them.  The Ambassador warned Sinirlioglu that Washington was now wondering if it could any longer count on Turkey to help contain Iran's profound challenge to regional peace and stability.  3. (C) Implying Erdogan's use of the term "gossip" was unconfirmed, Sinirlioglu claimed that the Turkish government "fully supports the P5-plus-1."  He asserted the prime minister's principled opposition to nuclear weapons in the region.  He argued Erdogan's rhetoric is a tactical effort to gain him credibility with the Middle Eastern street so he can better place the anti-nuclear weapons message.  Though Turkey "doesn't believe in sanctions," Sinirlioglu said, "we will support consensus" in the Security Council.  The Ambassador responded that Iran would be the single most important topic of conversation when Erdogan and POTUS meet in Washington on December 7.  4. (SBU) In marked contrast to Erdogan, President Gul November 2 said Turkey is against nuclear weapons in its region and the world, "especially in neighboring countries." In remarks to reporters while enroute to Slovakia, Gul reaffirmed Turkey's preference for diplomatic means (as opposed to the use of military force) to compel Tehran's adherence to its international obligations, but insisted that Iran "...must be transparent and open to IAEA inspection in order to overcome suspicions."  5. (C) Comment:  Erdogan's recent comments on Iran's nuclear program amount to a defense of Tehran's defiance of the international community's will.  His desire for a "good" Washington visit is the goad we will continue use to try to turn him back towards the international community consensus on Iran.  We will also emphasize to Erdogan's senior bureuacrats and, when the opportunity arises, to President Gul their interest in reining in Erdogan on Iran.

If Turkey passes all these tests without losing or isolating Israel in the Middle East completely, then Turkey will be considered successful, otherwise, we'll go back to Bush Administration's period."  Sami Kohen in mainstream Milliyet compares current ties between Ankara-Irbil, as compared to last year, and says because of Ankara's rationalist and pragmatic strategies, Turkey has improved relations with the Northern Iraqi Administration. He comments: "The Kurdish Administration in Northern Iraq, with US pressure, supported Turkey in its fight against PKK terrorism.  And we came to today's point through a series of diplomatic and political initiatives, supported by the military.  Good ties with Northern Iraq is necessary for Turkey, especially after the US withdrawal from Iraq."  Turkish NGO Goes to Court Against the Use of Incirlik Airbase by the US Papers report that following an application by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition, a Turkish NGO,  the Council of State (Danistay) prosecutor has demanded the annulment of a Council of Ministers decision made in 2007 to extend the agreement with the US allowing the use of Incirlik Airbase for another two years.  The prosecutor said the approval of the parliament was needed to extend the mandate for using Incirlik AB.  He noted that the parliament, and not the Council of Ministers, was to decide whether to authorize a foreign troop deployment in Turkey and to use Turkish facilities.  Danistay is expected to make a decision on the issue within a month, according to papers.  Sabah Multipart Series on Afghanistan  ANKARA 00001594  002 OF 004   Mainstream-pro government Sabah's diplomatic correspondent Duygu Guvenc went on a USNATO tour in October in Afghanistan, reporting on the Turkish ISAF contributions and the challenges of civilian infrastructure projects in a three part series. She leds off the series with a frank assessment of  Turkey's" tough mission" in Afghanistan and how Turkey handles many projects there, including the police force, education and health services.   In addition to ISAF cooperation, she also emphasizes that the future of Afghanistan is in civilian hands, noting the need for teachers, engineers and doctors.  One part of the series takes a humorous look at life for the ISAF forces there, from rock concerts to the delights of Afghani bread.  "Now, ISAF is looking for a way out from Afghanistan," she observes and notes that  "civilians hold the key for the troop exit from Afghanistan."  Turkey-Israel:  A Mini 'One Minute' Crisis in Rize and Calls for Gul to Visit Israel Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Aksam, Haberturk, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and Zaman report the mayor of the Black Sea province of Rize, Halil Bakirci, had an "unpleasant" exchange of remarks during a meeting with visiting Israeli Ambassador, Gaby Levy.  Mayor Bakirci told the Israeli Ambassador that the attitude of Turkish people toward Israel would not change as long as Israel continues its "expansionist policies."  "The people of Rize will defend themselves in the face of such threats, but they will not kill babies," said Bakirci.  Levy responded by saying that Israelis did not have any other alternatives for survival.  He admitted that Turkish-Israeli relations had entered a difficult period, but added that Turkey-Israel bilateral relations had strong roots.  According to Turkish media, the mayor went on to express anxiety about the safety of the Israeli tourists visiting the Black Sea region, who he said were viewed with suspicion but constitute 70 percent of all foreign visitors to the area.  Commentary Condemns:  In mainstream Hurriyet, Chief Editor Ertugrul Ozkok took aim at the Mayor, criticizing him for his warning that "Israeli tourists should not come to Rize" and for voicing concerns of Israel policies in Gaza.  According to Ozkok, "if Ankara's harsh language spreads internally and turns into warnings to an Ambassador from a Mayor, then, it will be difficult for the Turkish foreign policy to stretch when it is necessary."  Gul Should Visit Israel:  In mainstream Aksam, columnist Utku Cakirozer voices concern that the continuing diplomatic crisis will damage Turkey and Israel's strategic interests.  "The heaviest portion of the bill will go to Israel, because Turkey is Israel's only trustworthy ally in the Islamic world," he opines.  "Foreign Ministry officials in both countries and the Ambassadors in two capitals, exert extreme efforts to ease the tensions, however, the remarks of the politicians in both countries, do not help at all. We believe that, at this point, President Gul can play the most constructive role to eliminate the tensions.  If President Gul pays a visit to Israel, the relationship between Ankara-Tel-Aviv will reach the much deserved strategic level again."  Erdogan Calls on TGS to Turn In Anti-Government Conspirators Papers report Prime Minister Erdogan, on an alleged military plot against his government, called on the TGS Chief General Ilker Basbug to bring to justice the suspects who drafted the plan for fighting fundamentalism.  Erdogan wanted the army to hand over Colonel Dursun Cicek, the author of the plan, and five other military officers to the prosecutor.  TV and print media also carry reports of a new wrinkle in the Ergenekon crisis with the publication if a new "military memorandum" on fundamentalism.  Media report that last night an unidentified officer e-mailed a copy of another secret TGS memo dated April 2009, to the 'Ergenekon' prosecutor and media outlets.  The new memo indicates that 430 websites, including the NYT, the New York Post, The Independent, ANF, DIHA, Bianet, the AFP and the WP, were monitored.  Wire services reported that 292 of them were in Turkish and 138 in foreign languages.  They were categorized as "separatist," "fundamentalist," "nationalist," "extreme left,"  ANKARA 00001594  003 OF 004   "pro-EU" and "unbiased."  The memo was signed by eight officers, including Colonel Cicek.  It was presented to then TGS Deputy Chief, General Hasan Igsiz.  The memo also listed the websites used by the TGS for psychological warfare, say papers.  Erdogan: Turkey in Close Ties both with West and Islamic World All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan on Tuesday told his ruling AK Party group meeting that Turkey was "not shifting" its foreign policy, but was only getting "normalized."  Erdogan emphasized Turkey was in close relationship both with the West and the Islamic world.  "Defending the rights and humanity in the face of the Israeli atrocities in Gaza cannot be characterized as shifting politics," said Erdogan.  Erdogan-Akdag Disagreement on Swine Flu Vaccines Lead to Confusion All papers report Erdogan's controversial rejection of the swine flu vaccination, just as swine flu vaccinations began in Turkey and the death toll hit eleven.  Health Minister Recep Akdag was vaccinated in front of TV cameras as part of the nationwide swine flu vaccination campaign.  Prime Minister Erdogan, however, said he will not get vaccinated, adding he did not agree with the health minister that it should be compulsory.  Akdag said the prime minister was not in the group at risk for contracting the virus, and that citizens would make their own choice about the vaccination. Erdogan's remarks also led to confusion over the effectiveness of the vaccine, say papers.  Eyup Can in Hurriyet  writes that the PM has more concerns regarding the vaccination campaign which the public doesn't know. "Otherwise," he says, " the PM would not be concerned that if anything goes wrong with the campaign, his government would get all the blame."  Turkey to Establish University in Kabul (Zaman) Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Turkey would establish Mevlana University in Kabul, upon demands coming from President Karzai that Afghanistan's education needs be met.  In the first phase, an Education Faculty will be set up.  Afghanistan will need 100,000 more teachers by the beginning of 2010, says Zaman.  There is currently eight Turkish schools in Afghanistan, including two high schools for girls.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001654  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR EUR/SE  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/17/2019 TAGS: KNNP PREL TU IRSUBJECT: TURKEY: A/S GORDON PRESSES FM DAVUTOGLU ON IRAN  REF: ANKARA 1626  Classified By: Ambassador James Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4(b,d)  1. (S) Iran dominated A/S Gordon's 40-minute meeting November 12 with Foreign Minister Davutoglu.  The FM had just gotten off the phone with El-Baradei and had discussed in detail the IAEA proposal to send Iran's low enriched uranium to Turkey. El-Baradei had said he would "call Washington" that same morning.  This had followed two long "harsh" sessions with the Iranians in Istanbul on Sunday evening.  The Iranians have said they are willing to meet with Solana, but have told the Turks that they have serious problems with Cooper and the British.  They have "more trust" in the U.S.  The Iranians would also prefer to get fuel from the U.S. rather than the Russians.  2. (S) Davutoglu said the Iranians:  a) are ready to send a delegation to Vienna to work out the specifics on this proposal; b) have given their "full trust" to Turkey; c) continue to face serious domestic problems inside Iran.  He said the Turks actually see Ahmadinejad as "more flexible" than others who are inside the Iranian Government. Ahmadinejad is facing "huge pressure" after statements from some P5 members to the effect that a nuclear deal would succeed in weakening Iran,s nuclear capability -- which is interpreted by some circles in Iran as a virtual defeat.  3. (S) Given this context, the Turks had asked Ahmadinejad if the core of the issue is psychological rather than substance.  Ahmadinejad had said "yes," that the Iranians agree to the proposal but need to manage the public perception. Accordingly, the Iranians are proposing that the first 400 kilos be transferred to Kish Island -- thereby keeping it on Iranian soil -- and would receive right away an equivalent amount (30-50 kilos) of enriched fuel.  The second stage would focus on the management of Iranian public opinion, after which Tehran would proceed with the Turkey option for the remaining 800 kilos, probably in two tranches.  Davutoglu said Baradei agreed to consider this.  4. (S) Davutoglu noted that he had spoken to NSA General Jones Wednesday, who had said that we should perhaps suggest to the Iranians that they transfer 600 kilos to Kish Island and 600 kilos to Turkey simultaneously.  A/S Gordon said he could not give an official response to the proposal as this is the first time we heard it, but that he anticipates much skepticism about providing fuel to Iran before all the LEU has been taken out.  It would be better to get all 1200 kilos out right away.  5. (C) Davutoglu noted that these are two different proposals.  The first is Iran's request for fuel for its nuclear reactor.  Even if this takes place, he said, we still need to work on limiting Iran's nuclear enrichment capability.  If we succeed with this proposal, he said, it will create "confidence" and a "new momentum" and would allow room for negotiation.  6. (C) Noting that Davutoglu had only addressed the negative consequences of sanctions or the use of military force, Gordon pressed Davutoglu on Ankara's assessment of the consequences if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.  Davutoglu gave a spirited reply, that "of course" Turkey was aware of this risk.  This is precisely why Turkey is working so hard with the Iranians.  President Gul himself had spent two hours Sunday with Ahmadinejad in Istanbul.  7. (C) Gordon noted that while we acknowledge that Turkey can be helpful as a mediator, some of the Prime Minister's recent public comments raise questions about how Turkey sees this issue.  Davutoglu said he is aware of these concerns, but contended that the Guardian newspaper had not accurately presented its recent interview with the Prime Minister.   The PM's comments had been taken out of context.  Erdogan had been asked if he views Iran as a friend.  If he had said "no," it would not have been possible to convince Tehran to cooperate on this latest proposal.  Only Turkey can speak bluntly and critically to the Iranians, Davutoglu contended, but only because Ankara is showing public messages of friendship.  8. (C) Gordon pushed back that Ankara should give a stern public message about the consequences if UN resolutions are ignored.  Davutoglu countered that Erdogan had given just such a statement in Tehran when he visited.  He emphasized that Turkey's foreign policy is giving a "sense of justice" and a "sense of vision" to the region.  Turkey has provided a "third option" in addition to Iran and the Saudis (who he contended are viewed as "puppets" of the US).  The result, he said, is that we "limit Iranian influence in the region."  We  ANKARA 00001654  002 OF 002   need a "pro-Western approach AND a sense of justice."  9. (C) A/S Gordon has cleared this cable.  JEFFREY             "Visit Ankara's Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.s gov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turkey"

(C) Summary: American citizen Hossein Ghanbarzadeh Vahedi appeared in the Ankara Consular section around noon on January 9, 2009. Mr. Vahedi, age 75, told Conoff he had paid smugglers $7500 to take him across the Iranian/Turkish border after having been held against his will in Iran for seven months. Although suffering some aches and pains, he appeared to be in good health after a harrowing three-day journey from Tehran to Ankara that included a 14-hour mountain climb on horseback in freezing temperatures. Embassy staff provided immediate consular assistance and worked with Turkish authorities to prevent his deportation back to Iran. Consular officers escorted Vahedi to the Ankara airport where he departed on January 13. End summary.---------- Background---------- 2. (SBU) On January, 7, Embassy Bern alerted posts in the region that American citizen Hossein Ghanbarzadeh Vahedi, DPOB xx/xx/1933 was trying to escape from Iran and could possibly surface in Iraq. Vahedi, a dentist from Los Angeles, instead appeared at the Ankara Consular Section around noon on January 9, 2009. Although visibly shaken,Vahedi said he had no major physical problems, but he did break down a few times when explaining his ordeal. He told Conoff that he had enough medication and declined local medical attention preferring to wait until he was back in the United States.3. (SBU) Vahedi has been a resident, then citizen of the United States since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Aside from this trip, he has only returned to Iran once about ten years ago and did not encounter any problems on that visit. At his wifes urging to visit his parents gravesite in Iran, he traveled to Tehran in early May 2008 where he spent four weeks with family and friends without incident. However, after clearing customs at Tehran airport on June 6, he heard his name called on the public address system with instructions to report to a separate office. At this office, GOI authorities confiscated his passport and told him he would not be leaving Iran. When Vahedi pressed as to the reason, he was dismissed with instructions to follow-up at the Islamic Revolution Court.------------------------ Seven-Month House Arrest------------------------ 4. (SBU) Thus began a seven-month ordeal in which Vahedi appeared almost daily at the court to request that his passport be returned. During this de facto house arrest, Vahedi did contact Elizabeth Bucher, the Deputy Head of the Foreign Interest Section at the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran. He reported that Ms. Bucher was very kind and helped him get his heart medications, but was unable to help him depart the country. He lived with friends and relatives staying only a few days with each to avoid them being implicated in his problems.5. (SBU) Vahedi believed his passport was confiscated for two reasons, the first being simple extortion. It was made clear to him informally by the authorities at the court that if he paid a $150,000 fine the process would move more quickly. Secondly, he was told by GOI officials that he should use his influence to pressure his American citizen sons to terminate one of their business ventures. Vahedis sons are the owners of Concertino Productions, a Los Angeles-based entertainment company that promotes, among other things, the popular Persian pop singers Kamran and Hooman. In addition to American performances, the duet has performed in Dubai and other middle-eastern venues. According to Vahedi, while the singers are simply Persian pop singers, they have gotten crowds riled up with occasional anti-regime rhetoric. Also included in these performances are female dancers whose costumes would not raise an eyebrow in most countries, but are perceived as immoral by the conservative elements inside Iran.6. (SBU) Vahedi did not trust that paying the fine would expedite the return of his passport unless he also convinced his sons to cancel the next Dubai performance of Kamran and Hooman. Vahedi spoke of a third party who was pulling the strings within the Iranian government, particularly in regard to his son business. He repeatedly told the officials of the Islamic Revolution Court that his children had lived in America all of their lives and as such he exerted no control over their strong, typically American independent behavior.--------------- No Empty Spoons--------------- 7. (C) Vahedi spoke bitterly about his former country, especially its lack of a fair judicial system and widespread corruption. He told Conoff that all government employees receive free sugar, rice, and cooking oil to ensure their loyalty to the regime. He also said anyone with any authority lives by the why should I put an empty spoon into my mouth philosophy. Vahedi reported that regime spies were omnipresent including taxi drivers, hotel clerks, and restaurant workers. He also said it was common knowledge that all new Iranian-made cars had a Khamenei tax in the amount of $3100 that was earmarked for a fund for South Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria. At his daily appearances at the court, he came to know the intimate details of the lives of many of the other visitors, some of whom told Vahedi they had no idea where their loved ones were, or if they were even alive. Vahedi also helped one woman whose drug-addicted husband was incarcerated by paying her rent for the months he was there. Vahedi reported seeing Iranian citizens watch helplessly as their family members were hauled off in shackles without any official charges levied against them.----------------------- Picking the Best Option----------------------- 8. (C) Vahedi realized that this situation was not going to change and alluded to people who knew of his situation from his daily appearances at the court approaching him with departure options. Vahedi said he studied the four most common illegally used routes out of Iran. The first was crossing as a stowaway on a merchant ship across the Persian Gulf into the UAE. Vahedi dismissed this plan because he thought the heavy shipping traffic was too dangerous and they risked being boarded by the Iranian Navy who were patrolling the area. The second option was overland through Baluchistan but Vahedi could not obtain enough facts about the execution of that plan to seriously consider that route. The third choice was to enter Iraq heading to Karbala and try to make contact with a member of the American military stationed there. Vahedi seriously considered this option, but feared being discovered by the Iraqis before he could make contact with an American soldier. That left only the last option: over the mountains on horseback from Urmia to the Turkish border.9. (SBU) In spite of temperatures hovering around zero degrees Fahrenheit, Vahedi chose the early part of January because it coincided with the Shia commemoration of Ashura and he thought it likely the police would be more preoccupied. In the weeks prior to his departure, this 75-year old man trained for strength and altitude by climbing in the hills north of Tehran. To protect his family and friends from retribution by the GOI after his absence was noted, he spoke to none of them of his escape plans. On January 7 Vahedi boarded a bus from Tehran to Urmia, a city in the northern range of the Zagros Mountains in West Azerbaijan, Iran. He used his California drivers license as identification at each of the approximately 20 stops the bus made. At Urmia, he and a pre-arranged car and driver drove into the foothills of the mountains where he met two men with a single horse who would escort him through the mountain to the Turkish border.----------------- Over the Mountain----------------- 10. (C) The two escorts were paid $5000 at the beginning of the journey and the three set out as soon as it was dark. For all his planning, Vahedi did not have clothing appropriate for the weather and had a very difficult time with the cold. At one point during the 14-hour ride, the escorts had to physically hug him to keep him warm. As an inexperienced rider hours into the climb Vahedi lost his concentration and fell off the horse tumbling into the woods. He told Conoff that at this point, he really believed he was going to die by freezing to death on a mountainside. However, his only partially-paid escorts came to his aid and put him back on the horse. Although he had thought he would be able to walk part way, the altitude proved too much for him and his only choice was to remain on the horse. Vahedi said that he believes they were following known dug smuggling routes, evidenced by the way the horse knew exactly which way to turn. Vahedi said the horse often led the escorts, even going off the normal path in what seemed to be the wrong direction. Knowing that he escorts could also be trying to smuggle drugs on this trip, he covertly went through the one pack they had thrown on the horse and said he found nothing.11. (SBU) Once over the Turkish border they were met on schedule by a man Vahedi described as about 25 years old. During the handover, Vahedi paid out another $2500 but was unsure how the three escorts split that payment. The Turkish escort then brought Vahedi into a  home where he was fed and given time to rest and warm up.  In the early evening he was driven to Van, a major city in eastern Turkey, and waited there at the bus station for the 0200 bus to Ankara. Vahedi said he maintained a very low profile and did not talk to anyone during the 10-hour bus trip. He arrived at the Consular section around noon on Friday, January 9.-------------------- Deportation Conflict-------------------- 12. (C) As Vahedi had entered Turkey illegally, Conoff worked with GOT officials to ensure his deportation back to America. Initially the Chief of the Foreigners police within the Ministry of Interior in Ankara told Conoff that because we knew Vahedi was coming he intended to deport him back to Iran. Post is aware that Iranian and Iraqi citizens have been deported back to those countries in a fairly brutal manner. According to UNHCR some have been taken by bus in the middle of the night to the southern Turkish border and released. Police have then allegedly shot into the air forcing the deportees to run across the border into Iraq or Iran with no food or water to sustain them.(13) (C) Post contacted Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, who subsequently exerted pressure on the Ministry of Interior to allow this 75-year old American citizen to be deported back to the United States. Consular staff assured his security during the four days it took to work through the departure arrangements and accompanied him through the police and court proceedings and finally onward to the airport. Vahedi told Conoff he had never done anything illegal in his life and that he was ashamed to be seen in policy custody. Vahedi departed Turkey at 4:00 p.m. on January 13.------- Comment------- 14. (C) The problems Vahedi faced as a result of entering Turkey illegally highlights the tough stand this government takes on illegal entry. This is particularly true with Iranian and Iraqi nationals, even those who may also carry American citizenship. Ensuring Vahedis return to the United States, vice deportation to Iran required the intervention of the embassys front office.Visit Ankaras Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turk eyJeffrey
C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000321SIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2019TAGS: PREL ENRG EPET TU IRSUBJECT: DEALS WITH IRAN BENEFIT PM ERDOGAN'S FRIENDSREF: 08 ANKARA 2028Classified By: Economic Counselor Dale Eppler for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 1. (C) On February 22, local press reported that Turkey and Iran had established a joint venture company to develop gas in Iran and build a pipeline to bring this gas to Turkey and Europe. This JV was established to further the agreements reached in November 2008 and July 2007 MOUs between Turkey and Iran (reftel). In trying to undercover more about this deal, we spoke with several people. BOTAS Chairman Saltuk Duzyol said BOTAS was not included in the deal and that the agreement was made with a private company but declined to specify it. One of Energy Minister Guler's advisors, Musa Gunaydin, who is widely believed to be behind the Minister's push to do business with Iran refused to discuss the topic with us. xxxxx was more open. The Turkish company SOM Petrol has entered into a joint venture with Iran, Demir said. The owner of SOM Petrol is Sitki Ayan, a good friend of PM Erdogan. They both attended Istanbul Imam Hatip (religious high school). Ayan is in the PM's circle of friends including Mustafa Erdogan (PM's brother), Cihan Kamer (see para 2) and Mucahit Aslan. xxxxx. According to our research, xxxxx is active in port construction, fuel transshipments and other activities but doesn't appear to have any experience in upstream oil and gas development.2. (C) In 2007, Kartet, an electricity generation and exporting company, signed a deal with Tavanir, Iran's state owned electricity company to import from Iran 1.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity to Turkey. Kartet applied to the Turkish authorities (the Electricity Markets Regulatory Board, EMRA) to get an electricity import license. In November 2007, a Turkish company called Savk Electricity, owned by PM Erdogan's friend Cihan Kamer, received a license from EMRA to import electricity from Iran. At that time, Kartet went public with the dispute and claimed Savk action's were unethical and illegal. Kartet Istanbul Managing Director Nuray Atacik told us on February 27 that Kartet had still not received any response from EMRA and had basically given up on the project. However, she added with a bit of glee, Savk Electricity has not been able to realize the deal either. The Iranians prefer us and don't want to do a deal with a company that was forced on them, Atacik said.3. (C) Comment: If true, the PM's push of SOM Petrol to do the gas deal with Iran could actually slow progress on the deal. It is clear from the Savk Electricity case that Iran doesn't appreciate being assigned business partners. There are other reasons why this deal is on the slow-track, including lack of legal, regulatory and commercial framework for the deal and Iran's potential pique at the February 26 announcement that BOTAS won a USD 750 million arbitration case against Iran (although the award must still be accepted by Iranian authorities).

XXXXXXXXXXXX DIPLOMAT SHARES HIS PERSPECTIVE ASHGABAT 00001182 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: Acting DCM Peter Eckstrom, Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)1. (C) SUMMARY: XXXXXXXXXXXX's advised in a recent conversation with Ashgabat Iran Watcher that the U.S. would be ill-advised to begin talks with Iran, that it would be great disappointment to Iranians who have found hope in President Obama's message of change. He called Iran's leadership untrustworthy, and described the three main groups that he said are sustaining the regime: the clerical establishment, the paramilitaries and the Bazaaris (merchant class). XXXXXXXXXXXX finds little difference between any of the major figures in Iran, including most members of the opposition. END SUMMARY.A TRIANGULAR BASE OF SUPPORT2. (C) In a XXXXXXXXXXXX conversation with Iran Watcher, XXXXXXXXXXXX described his country's present political climate, stating that nothing has changed in either the power structure or how major decisions are made in Iran. He described the Iranian regime as a total dictatorship, whose continued survival depends on a triangular power base made up of the clerical establishment, the bazaari (merchants), and the paramilitaries (Revolutionary Guards and Basij). He said the three groups are so enmeshed, so dependent on one another, including through arranged marriages and business dealings, that the severance of any one of the three from the others would cause the regime to collapse. Supreme Leader Khamenei makes no decisions without consulting with son Mojtabah, he said, who is reputed to be running his father's office, in close consultation with Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi and Kayhan editor-in-chief Hossein Shariatmadari.3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX compared the regime to the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini, and said the only difference was that Iran, unlike Nazi Germany, has had the foresight not to invade another country militarily, thereby preventing, in his view, any concerted or effective international response to its human rights violations or support for terrorism abroad. The demonstrations that began after the June presidential election and continue still are the manifestation of a youthful population that is fed up and demanding their most basic human rights. He observed that the stress that thirty years of repression is more and more causing the population to suffer from psychological problems.ENGAGEMENT?NOT WITH THIS GOVERNMENT4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX was adamant that for the U.S. to enter into direct talks with Iran's leadership would be a mistake. Not only, he insisted, is the Iranian leadership untrustworthy, and dominated by a group of messianics, who base crucial decisions about domestic and foreign policy on a belief in the imminent return of the Missing (Twelfth) Imam. More importantly, he said, so many Iranians are pinning their hopes on President Obama's message of change, that for the U.S. now to negotiate with a government that continues to repress and violate the most basic rights of its citizens would be a huge disappointment, a blow to their own aspirations for change in Iran.THIS IS NOT 19805. (C) He said Iran is no longer the country or society that rallied around the war effort when Iraq invaded them in 1980. On the contrary, he said, many people he knows are actually saying things like, Where is Israel? Why don't they just attack us and put an end to this leadership? He said, however, that new sanctions on necessities such as fuel, would meet with immense public anger as they would mostly affect those who rely on gasoline to commute or make a living.ASHGABAT 00001182 002.2 OF 003 THE EDUCATION SYSTEM: A TOTAL MESS6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that if one counts both teachers and educators, about a third of the country is part of the education system. He lamented the government's squandering of its greatest national resource, the 70% of the population who are under the age of 29, with what he called substandard schooling. Such a youthful population, properly educated and trained, could be Iran's greatest asset, he said. Twenty percent of the population is illiterate, and the rest is comprised of two groups: those who are educated and informed (i.e. the voters who supported Mousavi and Karroubi), and the other, lesser-educated group more likely to follow the dictates of the government and the clerical establishment.DETAINEES RELEASED AFTER PAYMENTS OF CASH7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that people detained following the June election have had to pay large sums to be released. He described the parents and grandparents of Nazak Afshar, the French embassy local employee arrested and later released in August, as financially ruined after having to pay $500,000 for her release. It took everything they owned, he said, they have absolutely nothing now. Those whose families have no assets at all don't have a prayer of getting out, he said.AHMADINEJAD OR MOUSAVI: SHADES OF GRAY8. (C) In XXXXXXXXXXXX's view, the recent presidential election presented no real choice to the Iranian public, just the facade of one, because Mousavi himself is an insider, part of the establishment, and was even responsible as prime minister during the 1980's for the creation of the dreaded morality police. He said that the authorities made a big mistake in not allowing Mousavi to win the election in accordance with the popular vote. They could have controlled him, nothing would have changed, but their actions have now unleashed a frustration and an anger that they cannot control. He is equally unimpressed with former Presidents Khatami and Rafsanjani, whom he deems, just as interested in their personal fortunes over the interests of the people as everyone else, citing in particular the violent crackdowns on the student population that took place during Khatami's presidency.THE ANSWER?STOP THE FLOW OF CASH9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX sees the sanctions regime as ineffective. The infusion of cash from abroad is keeping the Iranian regime afloat 30 years after the revolution, including (indirectly, mostly through the UAE) from the U.S. and Europe. Large amounts of money for investment in the markets, especially Tehran's booming real estate market, is keeping the Bazaaris content. Investment in the sale of commodities, for example, brings a return of 50% per year, he said, and investors in real estate can double their money in just a few months. The Bazaaris are the key to everything, just as they were in 1979, he said. To see an end to this regime, cut off the funds coming through Dubai. If the regime loses the support of the Bazaaris, that will be the end of it. He considered it telling that, when the government attempted to impose a V.A.T. last winter, merchants went on strike and the bazaars were closed for several days. By comparison, he said, the bazaar has not closed once since the election in June, even during the demonstrations and mass arrests that followed.10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX11. (C) BIO NOTE AND COMMENT: XXXXXXXXXXXX 12. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX does nothing to hide his disdain for Iran's theocracy. In his view, it is a regime that is fundamentially flawed and incapable of reforming itself, respecting basic human rights, or becoming a responsible member of the international community. His scathing criticism is not directed only at Iran, however. He also expressed disappointment at the UN, and what he termed it's shameful silence in the face of such blatant human rights violations in Iran. XXXXXXXXXXXX. END COMMENT. CURRAN

(S/NF)  A Turkmen customs official told an Embassy LES on February 13 that an Iranian Embassy diplomatic container with AK-47's, sniper rifles and ammunition hidden in it had been discovered one week earlier at the Serdar Uli (Gaudan) customs point in Ashgabat, where vehicles and containers arriving from or bound for Iran are inspected.  The weapons were reportedly hidden underneath two Turkmen carpets that the Iranian Embassy was shipping to Iran.  2. (S/NF) The LES went to the Ashgabat Customs Point (a different location) to inquire about an Embassy pouch shipment arriving by truck, and an issue arose about opening the Embassy's container for inspection.  The customs official, who is a close friend of LES, then brought up the Iranian container incident.  He said that a local shipping employee of the Iranian Embassy had been present when another official, acting on a "hunch that something was not right," opened the Iranian Embassy container.  The customs official told LES that the official who discovered the cache was honored for his actions and received a promotion.  3. (S/NF) COMMENT:  Turkmenistan imposes stringent controls on the importation of any type of firearm, and Chiefs of Missions' security detail are all unarmed.  Even assuming that the weapons in question were intended for the Iranian Embassy's internal security, this would not explain the presence of offensive weapons such as sniper rifles, in the cache.  The Embassy has no official confirmation about the incident, which was, we note, relayed second-hand to our LES.  END COMMENT.   MILES

(C) The Turkmen Government announced earlier this month that President Berdimuhamedov had signed a decree allowing the state chemical concern "Turkmenkhimiya" to enter into a contract with Ekomet-S of Russia for the transfer and burial of radioactive waste.  The waste was reportedly produced at the Hazar chemical plant and at the Balkanabat iodine plant.  2. (S) In a meeting with the Charge on February 17, Turkish Ambassador Huseyin Bichakli raised concerns about reports that Turkmenistan and Russia plan to resume uranium production in Turkmenistan.  He said that he had learned from sources that a Russian military delegation had visited Turkmenistan in early January and visited the site of a former "uranium" plant at Kizilkaya in Balkan Province.  The plant operated during the Soviet era.  He said that the delegation was also briefed on the planned North-South railroad line from Russia to Iran, which includes a 700 km stretch through Turkmenistan.  Ambassador Bichakli said there were rumors that the railroad would be used to transport uranium processed at the currently inactive Turkmen uranium plant to Iran.  3.

(C) In a conversation today with Iran Watcher, a [Source removed] in Ashgabat labeled the announcement of Mahmoud Ahmadinejads victory in Fridays presidential election a coup detat, and called Irans incumbent President another Pinochet. [Name removed] said that based on calculations from Mousavis campaign observers who were present at polling stations around the country and who witnessed the vote counts, Mousavi received approximately 26 million (or 61%) of the 42 million votes cast in Fridays election, followed by Mehdi Karroubi (10-12 million). According to his sources, Ahmadinejad received a maximum of 4-5 million votes, with the remainder going to Mohsen Rezai. He said that more than anything else, the huge turnout of voters on Friday was a reflection of the Iranian electorates overwhelming anti-Ahmadinejad sentiments.PRECINCT RESULTS OBSCURED2. (C) [Name removed] said that in a clear departure from established electoral rules and practice in Iran, including the procedures followed in the 2005 presidential election and last years legislative elections, the authorities embargoed the results from individual precincts and announced instead that they must be conveyed directly to the central election authorities, who would announce the overall results after all the votes were counted. The Iranian authorities knew, he said, that attempts to falsify individual precinct counts could be countered by observers from the Mousavi and the other campaigns, so in order to engineer a lopsided Ahmadinejad victory, they had no choice but to conceal the precinct results. In his words, People know who they voted for and the observers know who won in each precinct.ARAB REACTION: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT3. (C) [Name removed] said that Iranians are puzzled by the muted reaction thus far of the U.S. and EU governments, as well as very disappointed by the number of Arab rulers who have sent messages to Ahmadinejad congratulating him on his victory. He said that the international community should acknowledge the illegitimacy of the election and demand that the Iranian authorities release and account for the results from each precinct. He said the IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) was behind the coup. Even Supreme Leader Khamenei, he said, to whom the IRGC owes allegiance, is not totally in control of the IRGC. Citing the IRGCs warnings against a velvet revolution in the days leading up to the election, it would appear that the IRGC has taken on a life of its own.IRANIAN DIPLOMATS GET 4TH OF JULY INVITATION INSTRUCTIONS4.

BAGHDAD 289  Classified By: Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Patricia A. Butenis for  reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (S/NF) Summary:  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force (IRGC-QF) officers are active in Iraq, conducting traditional espionage and supporting violent extremists as well as supporting both legitimate and malign Iranian economic and cultural outreach.  Iraqis and their government have demonstrated increasing willingness to push back against malign Iranian influence in the last year.  Working with the Iraqis, we have succeeded in stopping some IRGC-QF activity through military operations and diplomatic engagement, while we prevented some IRGC-QF officers from entering Iraq through explicit warnings that we would target them unilaterally. However, under the Security Agreement effective January 1, all operations in Iraq must be conducted in conjunction with Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), and our previous unilateral warnings carry less weight.  As Coalition Forces continue the period of responsible drawdown, we will rely increasingly on the GOI to keep the pressure on the IRGC-QF.  We intend to support the GOI in these efforts through continued diplomatic engagement, intelligence sharing, and our security partnership of Coalition Forces working by, with, and through the ISF. End summary.  ----------- Background: -----------  2. (S/NF) IRGC-QF leadership took advantage of the vacuum which surrounded the fall of Saddam Hussein and the entry of Coalition Forces into Iraq in 2003, using the opportunity to send operatives to Iraq when little attention was focused on Iran.  In January 2007, Coalition Forces raided an unofficial Iranian consulate in Erbil, detaining five Iranians who claimed to be diplomats but in reality held no diplomatic status.  They were suspected of operations aimed at killing Coalition and Iraqi security forces (refs A and B).  The original targets of the raid, IRGC-QF officers Abbas Hoseyni (of the Erbil office) and Hormat Faruqi (of the Sulaimaniyah office), escaped and fled to Iran.  The Iranian government immediately pulled back most IRGC-QF officers from Iraq and shuttered its "consulates" in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah until mid-2007; consulates in Basrah and Karbala remained open. Since 2007, Iran has submitted diplomatic visa applications for Hoseini and Faruqi to return to Iraq.  In 2008 the Embassy and MNF-I convinced the GOI not to approve these applications, making it clear if they returned to Iraq, they would be targeted by Coalition Forces.  3. (S/NF) Since 2008, the MFA has passed names of Iranians applying for diplomatic visas to the US Embassy for vetting. Background checks have revealed that about 20 percent have possible ties to the IRGC or Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) (ref C).  The MFA has informed us that it denies visas to all new suspected intelligence officers, but we have not been able to verify such claims.  In January 2009, the MFA passed a list of 35 names to the USG of Iranian diplomats already in country before the vetting process began.  Of those, eight had ties to IRGC or MOIS.  -------- Strategy --------  4. (S/NF) As U.S. forces continue a period of responsible draw down, we will seek to ensure that the GOI understands that IRGC-QF activity harms Iraq -- which should be self-evident if the IRGC-QF continues to conduct malign activity that targets Iraqi citizens and infrastructure. Qactivity that targets Iraqi citizens and infrastructure. Engagements with political and security leadership at the national and provincial level, intelligence sharing, and security cooperation will be key to explaining the dangers of IRGC-QF activity and providing Iraqis the information they need to defend their own interests.  The following are diplomatic, political, military, intelligence, and public information options which either the GOI can pursue unilaterally, or in concert with the USG, to target IRGC-QF activity in Iraq.  --------- Diplomacy ---------   BAGHDAD 00001103  002 OF 003   5. (S/NF) We intend to continue working closely with the MFA to deny visas to Iranian intelligence officers.  We may also consider suggesting that the MFA use another diplomatic tool, albeit one with more consequences --  the "persona non grata" designation.  The MFA may be reluctant to take this step because Iraqi diplomats in Iran would face retaliation and the dispute would inevitably become public.  Since the fall of Saddam, the GOI has avoided most public disagreements with Iran.  -------------------- Security Partnership --------------------  6. (S/NF) The role of the ISF in countering IRGC-QF in Iraq is critical, yet complex.  We can encourage the Iraqi Army to take the lead on kinetic action against IRGC-QF agents, with Iraqi police monitoring and reacting to suspicious activity at the local level.  We intend to continue to strengthen our partnership with the ISF to counter pro-Iranian elements who have infiltrated the security forces such as Kata'ib Hizbollah and Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq.  While the US combat mission will end by August 31, 2009, we will continue to assist the Ministry of Defense (MOD) with training, equipment, mentoring and other bilateral military-to-military programs and engagements.  Military sales, such as the recent Iraqi interest in purchasing F-16s and plans to transition from AK-47 to M-4 rifles, will increase US influence through training and support in Iraq for years to come, although the MOD will continue to consider weapons purchases from other sources as well.  --------------- Border Controls ---------------  7. (S) The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) can help limit IRGC-QF activity by combating smuggling and scrutinizing people and cargo crossing legitimate routes from Iran into Iraq.  While the DBE currently has a strong commander, Major General Mohsen Abdul Hasan Lazim, corruption at the ports of entry (POEs), unwillingness of inspectors to do their jobs, and poor leadership and professionalism at the supervisory level keep the DBE from being fully effective. The USG can assist, however. Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES), which checks travelers' biographic data, is already in use at many land and air POEs around Iraq.  Additional training at sea ports, airports, and land borders could help Iraqi officials detect smugglers of cash, weapons, weapons components and other contraband.  An Iranian IRGC-QF officer was briefly detained at Baghdad International Airport in November 2008 when his name was flagged in PISCES.  In January 2009, KRG's Minister of the Interior Karim Sinjari praised PISCES and asked for the system at two more land border entry points the KRG shares with Iran, Khalil Ibrahim and Hadjer Meran.  8. (S) As of April 2009, there were 200 PISCES units in operation at 15 different POEs in Iraq.  Current guidance states that every traveler entering or exiting Iraq is processed through PISCES.  On occasion however, travelers will pay a small "fee" to enter or exit without going through PISCES.   If a potential match is found to someone on the "stop list," the screen freezes, and only INIS can unlock the screen and conduct a secondary inspection.  INIS notifies the GOI or USG when the identity of a wanted person is confirmed.  PISCES is operated by Immigration officers assigned to the Department of Travel and Nationality, and the GOI will continue to use PISCES after the military drawdown. Collection and storage of biometric data is another tool the QCollection and storage of biometric data is another tool the GOI is already using at POEs, although Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT) system is run by U.S. forces and will not stay in Iraq after their departure.  9. (S/NF) A timely example of cooperation with DBE in countering Iranian lethal aid smuggling occurred April 14.  A DBE brigade in Maysan Province, partnered with Multi-National Division-South (MND-S) forces, captured an unmanned boat carrying explosive devices floating in the Huwayza Marsh. The patrol found three explosively formed projectiles (EFPs) and other military equipment.  MND-S said it was the first time the DBE had reported success against this type of smuggling.  -------------------- Intelligence Sharing --------------------   BAGHDAD 00001103  003 OF 003   10. (S/NF) Coordinating with GOI intelligence agencies to stop IRGC-QF activity is complicated by the fact that the Iraqi intelligence establishment is extremely fragmented. Intelligence offices affiliated with the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), DBE, and the Ministry of State for National Security Affairs (MSNSA) do not trust each other and often work in opposition.  The USG could further assist Iraqi intelligence by negotiating and approving a bilateral US-Iraqi intelligence sharing agreements and further providing the GOI with intelligence that demonstrates the involvement of IRGC-QF officers in lethal assistance to extremists. US Forces in Iraq have established positive relationships with their ISF counterparts and are developing appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms. The USG can also assist the GOI to further develop its intelligence infrastructure to monitor malign Iranian influence and counter the IRGC-QF.  INIS currently interacts closely with the Office of Regional Affairs (ORA).  The establishment of a Defense Attach's Office at the Embassy will also help facilitate intelligence sharing and is under consideration by Chief of Mission.  ------------------- Public Information -------------------  11. (S/NF) Highlighting nefarious Iranian activity to GOI leadership and the Iraqi public has had a significant impact on increasing GOI willingness to confront Iran, as well as public rejection of Iranian attempts to dominate Iraq's political and economic sectors.  Provincial elections demonstrated that perceived fealty to Iran is a political liability for Iraqi politicians, and they are increasingly sensitive to it.  Continued USG assistance in uncovering and publicizing Iranian attempts to influence events in Iraq will make the country a much more inhospitable environment for IRGC-QF operatives.  ------- Comment -------  12. (S/NF) The Iranian government may sense that the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq presents an opportunity to expand IRGC-QF activity, although the broader regional dynamic will undoubtedly also influence Iranian decision making.  Without the ability to conduct unilateral military action against IRGC-QF operatives in Iraq, we will leverage our evolving diplomatic, intelligence, security, and military partnerships with Iraq to maintain pressure.  Many USG agencies will be involved in assisting the Iraqis in this critical area, and must actively engage in order to counter IRGC-QF officers and their lethal aid. BUTENIS

Grappo for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S) SUMMARY: Iran is a dominant player in Iraq's electoral politics, and is using its close ties to Shia, Kurdish, and select Sunni figures to shape the political landscape in favor of a united Shia victory in the January election.  A pro-Iran, Shia-dominated, and preferably Islamist government, led by a united Shia alliance remains Iran's top priority.  Toward that end, Iran is seeking to increase pressure on Maliki to join forces with the other prominent Shia coalition (Iraqi National Alliance) led by the Sadrists and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI).  END SUMMARY  2. (S) Iran is arguably the most influential regional power seeking to shape and influence the outcome of Iraq's election.  This message offers an assessment of Iran's efforts to shape Iraq's electoral politics in anticipation of the national election in January.  Iran's Policy Goals and Tools -----------------------------  3.  (S) Iran's over-arching political objective for Iraq's January election is the re-election of a Shia-dominated, preferably Islamist, coalition led by Tehran's closest allies, notably ISCI and the Sadrist Trend under the rubric of the Iraqi National Alliance coalition (INA) (reftel). Iraq, given its proximity to Iran and its shared Shia heritage, represents a vital foreign policy priority for the Iranian government's (IRIG) efforts to project its ideology and influence in the region.  An economically dependent and politically subservient Iraq would foster greater strategic depth for Tehran. Iranian president Ahmadinejad has referred to Iraq in recent press statements as "a Shia base" confronting the broader menace perpetrated by those opposed to Iraq's identity and stability (i.e., Sunni states, the West).  4.  (S) Iran's approach to its bilateral relationship with Iraq ranges from political micro-management to broad strategic guidance emanating directly from Supreme Leader Khamenei in Tehran. The IRIG recognizes that influence in Iraq requires operational (and at times ideological) flexibility.  As a result, it is not uncommon for the IRIG to finance and support competing Shia, Kurdish, and to some extent, Sunni entities, with the aim of developing the Iraqi body politic's dependency on Tehran's largesse.  While exact figures are unknown, Tehran's financial assistance to Iraqi surrogates is estimated at USD 100-200 million  annually, with USD 70 million going to ISCI/Badr coffers.  5.  (S) Since at least 2003, Brigadier General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), has been the point main directing the formulation and implementation of the IRIG's Iraq policy, with authority second only to Supreme Leader Khamenei. Through his IRGC-QF officers and Iraqi proxies in Iraq, notably Iranian Ambassador and IRGC-QF associate Hassan Kazemi-Qomi, Soleimani employs the full range of diplomatic, security, intelligence, and economic tools to influence Iraqi allies and detractors in order to shape a more pro-Iran regime in Baghdad and the provinces.  6.  (S) Soleimani enjoys long-standing close ties with several prominent GOI officials, including President Talabani, Vice-President Adel Abdal-Mahdi (ISCI), Prime Minister Maliki (Da'wa), former PM Jaafari, and more recently, Speaker Samarra'i (Septel reports Iranian Speaker Qrecently, Speaker Samarra'i (Septel reports Iranian Speaker Larijani's November 4-7 visit to Iraq at Samarra'i's invitation.).  Khamenei, President Ahmadinejad, Speaker Larijani, and former president Rafsanjani consult regularly with visiting GOI officials as part of the IRIG's broader "strategic" council of advisers seeking to influence the GOI.   7.  (S) Iran's tools of influence include financial support to (and pressure on) a cross-spectrum of Iraqi parties and officials; economic development assistance, notably to religious organizations; lethal aid to select militant Shia proxies; and sanctuary to Iraqi figures fearful of USG targeting or those seeking to revitalize their political/religious credentials, most notably Moqtada al-Sadr.  This leverage also extends, to a lesser extent, to select Sunni actors, including such public figures as Iraqi Speaker Samarra'i, whose September visit to Tehran included  BAGHDAD 00002992  002 OF 003   meetings with several senior IRIG officials.  Pre-Election Jockeying ----------------------  8.  (S) Predictably, Iran is actively lobbying and recruiting Iraqis of various political stripes and affiliations, including Sunnis, in the run-up to the election to ensure a united Shia-led coalition government.  Given the likelihood of a Shia-led victory in the election, Iran appears more concerned about the strength of a united Shia bloc in the post-election phase of government formation.  For Iran, a "rebellious" Maliki pursuing a more nationalist vs. sectarian agenda risks splitting the Shia vote, which in turn weakens the Shia political bloc's negotiating strength during the government formation period post-election.  Iran's greatest fear for the upcoming election is a fractured Shia coalition that is unable to coalesce and thereby dominate the next government.  Iran's worst-case election scenario (increasingly unrealistic) is a coup d'etat of former regime elements hostile to Tehran.  9.  (S) A weak Shia coalition before or after the election would further undermine the INA and their pro-Iranian entities, notably ISCI and the Sadrist Trend.  The Kurds, historically closer to ISCI, remain the important swing vote and are unlikely to reveal their true coalition intentions until after the election.  As seasoned masters of the Iraqi political chessboard, Kurdish leaders such as Talabani and Barzani will likely exploit their political strength among Shia/Sunni counterparts to protect and expand Kurdish influence in a future government. Iran's historic ties to the PUK, and to a lesser extent KDP officials, make the Kurds an important element in ensuring a pro-Iranian Shia victory in the election.  INA officials are confident that the Kurds will join their coalition, all but guaranteeing an election victory.  An unknown factor in national elections is the Kurdish opposition party, Goran List, under the leadership of former PUK Secretary General Nawshirwan Mustafa.  Goran is committed to unseating the PUK (and Talabani) in Suleymaniyah province but needs financial backing to ensure its long-term viability in the KRG and national politics.  Iran could conceivably alleviate Goran's financial woes, particularly through its close ties with the Kurdish Jaff tribe, some of whom are Goran members.  However, doing so would undermine the IRIG's valued relationship with Talabani, while also proving exceedingly duplicitous, even by IRIG and KRG standards.  10. (S) It is important to note that Iran's power in Iraq, although extensive, is not without limitations.  The IRIG's greatest political roadblock remains the domineering authority and religious credibility embodied in Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. Despite his Iranian heritage, Sistani is Iraq's most revered Shia religious (and political) authority.  A critic of Iran's "Velayet-e-Faqih" (rule of the jurisprudent) system of theocratic governance, Sistani's abstemious (aka Quietest school) approach to Shia politics has kept him well above the political fray while at the same time ensuring him significant impact on those rare occasions when he pronounces on politics.  For example, Sistani's public support for an open list ballot was instrumental in prompting ISCI, Sadrist Trend, Maliki's State of Law, and other Shia parties to follow suit, despite Tehran's preference for a closed list.  Domestic political realities will continue to force Shia political parties like ISCI, Dawa Qwill continue to force Shia political parties like ISCI, Dawa and Sadr Trend, with close historic ties to Iran, to balance between support for a broader Iraqi-Shia agenda, as championed by Sistani, and the alternative, championed by Iran, that would subordinate Iraqi interests to Iran's broader objectives (septel).  Soft vs. Hard Power -------------------  11.  (S) Following the GOI's crackdown on Iranian-supported Sadrist militias in Basrah during the "Charge of the Knights" operation in March 2008, Iran has calibrated its operations in Iraq to encompass more "soft power" (economic, religious, educational) support and investment as part of a broader "hearts and minds" campaign. (NOTE: Iranian lethal aid to militant proxies continues; however, on a less visible scale.  END NOTE).  With annual bilateral trade estimated at USD 4 billion (up 30 percent since 2008) and comprised mostly of Iranian imports (approximately 48 percent of Iraq's imports are Iranian goods), the IRIG continues to jockey for economic domination in Iraq through targeted development assistance, focused largely on refurbishment of Shia religious shrines,  BAGHDAD 00002992  003 OF 003   and trade deals and bilateral agreements aimed at fostering greater Iraqi economic dependency on Iran.  This measure has been successful, largely because of Iran's geographic proximity and access to Iraqi markets that are otherwise financially or politically less appealing to other states, notably the United States, Europe, and other industrialized nations.  Turkey, on the other hand, remains Iran's biggest economic competitor, particularly in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).  Implications for U.S. Policy ----------------------------  12.  (S) COMMENT:  Concerns about long-term U.S. influence, albeit tempered by the withdrawal deadline, continue to inform IRIG decision-making to ensure its strategic foothold in Iraq.  Iran views Iraq as a natural (and more junior) strategic partner.  As a result, Iran will continue to flex its muscles to ensure it's strategic outcomes are met.  This should not lead to alarmist tendencies or reactions on our part.  The next Iraqi government will continue to cultivate close ties with Iran given long-standing historical realities that precede Iraq's ties with the United States.  On the other hand, Iran's influence in Iraq should not be overestimated.  As the GOI continues to gain its footing, points of divergence between Tehran and Baghdad become increasingly evident on such sensitive bilateral issues as water, hydrocarbons, maritime borders, and political parity. Some prominent Iraqi leaders, including those with close ties to Iran (i.e., Maliki, Ammar al-Hakim) are increasingly sensitive to being labeled Iranian lackeys.  13.  (S)  COMMENT CONT'D:  Our objective in Iraq should be less about countering all-things Iranian, and more about developing viable alternatives and approaches that gradually alter the GOI's political, economic, and social worldview. Development of viable international alternatives in Iraq is one of the most effective measures of countering Iranian ambitions and, ultimately, integrating Iraq as a constructive member of the international community.  Specifically, our ongoing efforts to bolster the GOI through capacity-building and assistance within the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) and to remove Iraq from Chapter VII remain our most valuable tools in this regard. Given the value placed on the SFA by the GOI and the Iraqi public, our ability to recognize, enhance, and exploit the value of the partnership will constitute an essential element of any effort to counter "malign" Iranian influence.

EO 12958 DECL: 12/06/2019 TAGS PGOV, PECON, PREL, IR, IZ SUBJECT: IRAN/IRAQ: THE VIEW FROM NAJAF Classified By: Political M/C Gary A. Grappo for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Local interlocutors from Najafs social, economic, political and military circles discussed with Posts Senior Iran Watcher (IW) and PRToffs the scope of Iranian influence in the province, the role of the Shia clerical establishment (Marjaiyyah), notably Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, and the challenges confronting the provinces farmers who are unable to compete with Iranian-subsidized produce. Interlocutors generally cautioned against a premature U.S. departure and agreed that Iran remains an influential force in Najaf, leveraging its ties with Iraqi political groups to extend its influence. Iran remains wary of Sistanis social and political clout among Shias, notably in Iran, given the Grand Ayatollahs rejection of the Iranian regimes adherence to clerical rule (vilayat-e-faqih). END SUMMARY2. (C) During a recent visit to Najaf [Sources removed] shared their views on the state of political and economic development in the province and Irans role.Provincial Council Chairman--------------------------- 3. (C) [Name removed] asserted that Iraqis throughout the country were growing increasingly frustrated with foreign interference, notably from Iraqs neighbors. He singled out Saudi Arabia and Iran as the biggest culprits, but noted that a mental revolution was underway among Iraqi youth against foreign agendas seeking to undermine the countrys stability, pointing to such trends in Anbar against the Saudis, Najaf against the Iranians, and Mosul against the Turks.4. (C) [Name removed] echoed other interlocutors concerns about a premature U.S. departure from Iraq and risks of a political and security vacuum. He noted that Iran had formed the Iraqi National Alliance (INA) political coalition comprised of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and the Sadrists, among others, in an effort to bolster ISCIs image as the pan-Shia party of choice in the elections.5. (C) [Name removed] expressed concerns about rumors circulating in Najaf that the USG was sponsoring a Baathist conference in the U.S. IW dismissed the news as baseless rumors intended to undermine the USG-GOI relationship. (NOTE: A recent press report in an ISCI-owned media also mentioned a proposed Baathist conference scheduled to be held in Washington in February. END NOTE).Keeping the U.S. Bogged Down---------------------------- 6. (C) [Name removed] described Iran as a threat to Iraqi stability, commenting that the Iranian governments (IRIG) goal is to keep the U.S. bogged down in Iraq in order to discourage U.S. military reprisals against the IRIG for its nuclear program. He commented that Iran fears Iraqs potential influence in the region, and will continue to support local proxies to exert its influence and undermine Iraq. Iran does not offer its support for free, [Name removed] noted, there will be a price to pay for each proxy in exchange for Iranian support.7. (C) [Name removed] is supportive of Malikis decision to forego (at least for now) a political alliance with the INA that is dominated by the pro-Iranian Sadrist Trend and ISCI. Joining the INA will only undermine the integrity of Iraqi security institutions as ISCI/Badr and the Sadrists will try to fill key security positions with their own supporters, many of whom are unprofessional and sectarian, [Name removed] cautioned. The Badr Organization, heavily influenced by Iran, continued to maintain a very effective intelligence arm, according to [Name removed]. Many former Iraqi fighter pilots who flew sorties against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war were now on Irans hit list (NOTE: According to [Name removed], Iran had already assassinated 180 Iraqi pilots. END NOTE).8. (C) [Name removed] also noted that Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) elements often resort to bribes (USD 10-20K) to secure the release of supporters in GOI detention and that the Najaf anti-terrorism unit regularly receives cash offers to release detainees. He asserted that  [Name removed] also alleged that the Iraqi police were responsible for placing an IED close to the PRT base in November. He (police chief) is a bad guy. After all, he is still part of the militia (Badr), [Name removed] asserted.Sistani: What Do the Americans Want? ----QDI>RpQd%MkQQto pulse the cleric on his views about matters of political consequence. [Name removed] explained that Sistanis son, Muhammad Ridha, serves as the main conduit of information between his father whenever a religious/political message needs to be conveyed to Shia imams in the country.12. (C) Sistani does not allow Iranian students to enroll in the howzeh (religious seminary) in order to prevent IRIG infiltration, [Name removed] asserted. [Name removed] himself is suspicious of Iranian intentions and asserted that the imams  were in the pocket of the Iranians, despite their proclaimed loyalties to Sistani.The Sadrists------------ 13. (C) Regarding the Sadrists, [Name removed] recalled fondly his time as a student of the late Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr (Moqtada Al-Sadrs father), commenting that, unlike his radical son, the late cleric was admired and respected by many Iraqis. He Qthe late cleric was admired and respected by many Iraqis. He criticized Moqtada for failing to capitalize and build on his fathers legacy. [Name removed] also praised the efforts of Sadrs father and sought to distinguish between good and bad Sadrists; the former being adherents of Sadrs father. [Name removed] believes the Sadrists are politically weak and continue to splinter as former JAM elements form their own groups. (NOTE: [Name removed] believes [Name removed] is a closet Sadrist despite his public alliance with Malikis coalition. [Name removed] commented that the Iranians had told the wayward Moqtada to stay-put in Iran for the time being. END NOTE).Farmers: Iran and Syria Waging Economic Warfare--------------------------------------------- -- 14. (C) [Name removed] commented that most farmers support PM Maliki for his increasingly non-sectarian political message and success in improving security. However, he complained that Iran and Syria were waging economic warfare on Iraqi farmers by flooding provincial markets with low cost/quality produce that are heavily subsidized by their respective governments.15. (C) Iraqs neighbors were pursuing such measures in order to prevent economic development, thereby forestalling the continued success of Iraqs new democracy, [Name removed] alleged. These problems were further aggravated by water shortages due to the ongoing drought, the high cost of fuels, outdated farming techniques, and power shortages, he noted. [Name removed] confirmed that the Najaf Provincial Council had recently voted to ban the import of foreign tomatoes into Najaf in an effort to bolster local producers. (NOTE: 60 percent of Najafs labor force works in agriculture. The sector is the provinces most important revenue generating industry, followed by religious tourism. END NOTE).16. (C) [Name removed] railed against Irans pervasive commercial influence in Najaf, noting that many Iranian-owned companies secure favorable contracts in the province by capitalizing on ties with local politicians. [Name removed] also criticized Iraqi politicians for being ignorant and overly-reliant on clerics for their political welfare.COMMENT------- 17. (C) Najaf, as the epicenter of Shia Islam, carries significant importance for Iran and its overall campaign to expand its sphere of influence in Iraq and the region. The city is home to many Iranian pilgrims and traders eager to profit spiritually and financially from the citys religious and commercial offerings. There is general awareness and acknowledgment among many Iraqis that Irans influence, albeit a historic reality, does not always translate into mutual benefit for Najafis. Many also acknowledge that Iran will continue to capitalize on its ties to the city in order to foster greater socio-economic dependencies. The extent of its ability to influence the ways of the Marjaiyyah are more limited, particularly during Sistanis tenure, given the clerical establishments unrivaled theocratic and geographic prominence when compared to its sister city Qom.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 BAKU 000175  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2019 TAGS: PREL ETRD SNAR ECON AJ TU RU IRSUBJECT: IRAN'S MONEY LAUNDERERS, SANCTIONS-BUSTERS, AND REVOLUTIONARY GUARD MONEY MAKERS: A BAKU SAMPLER  REF: A) BAKU 139 B) BAKU 132 C) BAKU 80 D) 2008 BAKU      917  Classified By: POLECON CHIEF ROB GARVERICK, REASON 1.5 (B and D)  Summary ---------  1.  (S)  According to widespread rumor, many Iranians in Baku are involved full- or part-time in Iranian regime-related profit making, sanctions-busting, money laundering, and similar activities.  Activities range from assisting Iranian interests "on the side" of pursuing private activities, to working primarily for Iranian government entities.  These Iranians' formal businesses in Azerbaijan include factories, construction companies, trading companies, and shops, some of which may be hollow companies hiding illicit or semi-licit activities.  Some are also said to be significant actors in obtaining spare parts and equipment for the Revolutionary Guard, raising revenues and managing money for it and/or regime figures, or managing Iran-origin narcotics trafficking.  The list is a "sampler" of the types of personnel and activities singled out to Iran watcher by multiple sources as actively involved in Iranian regime-supportive financial and procurement activities.  The list suggests the extensive and complex interconnection of Iranian figures and activities that reportedly support Iranian security organizations and regime figures.  End Summary.  2.  (S) Baku Iran watcher received the information below from a wide variety of independent Iranian and Azerbaijani sources (strictly protect), including Baku-based Iranian students, business figures, and human rights activists; a Tehran-based Iranian exporter; a prominent businessman working in Iran; the Executive Director of AmCham in Azerbaijan; an Azerbaijani oil company executive; and a local partner in a leading international management consulting firm.  In almost all cases the information below was related/confirmed separately by at least three of the above sources.  3.  (S) Please note that, while serious efforts have been made to cross-check the information below and ignore "indirect" claims, Iran watcher has no independent ability to verify these allegations.  Although some of these figures are well known in Baku and/or among the resident Iranian community, Baku Iran watcher has never met any of them.  The information below should be interpreted in this context.  4.  (S) Begin List:  A.  (S) Jamal Allavi.  Three Iranian sources claimed that Allavi is a close relative of the ex-Mayor of Ardebil, and a former colleague/friend of President Ahmedinajad.  He now runs several Iranian companies (mostly trading), and is the head of a provincial cooperative organization "Tavanee Marzneshinan Fedayan Velayat," entitled to export and import items with reduced restrictions.  Allavi has a house in Baku and frequently travels on business to Azerbaijan, Russia, China, and Kazakhstan.  He uses his businesses as a cover for procuring and importing military spare parts and other items needed by the Revolutionary Guard and other Iranian security forces, bribing customs officials as necessary.  A fourth Iranian source noted that, while he did not know Allavi, the company name is a "giveaway" of Revolutionary Guard/regime connections.  B.  (S) FNU "Lotfi".  Runs a large artificial leather factory in Ardebil ("Kharkhaneye Charmeh Masnui)", and other businesses based in Iranian Azerbaijan.  He is a close associate of Jamal Allavi (entry "A" above), with whom he cooperates in smuggling activities.  He is an officer in the Revolutionary Guard (possibly retired), and his businesses are actually Revolutionary Guard-owned.  He travels to Malaysi, Singapore, Dubai, Turkey, and Iraq as well as zerbaijan on Revolutionary Guard business.  He als assists Revolutionary Guard and/or Iranian intelligence operations by "getting for them what they need," including communications equipment and technical information.  C.  (S) Adil Sharabiani.  An Iranian currency exchange dealer with "close links" to Tehran.  He was formerly a manager of  BAKU 00000175  002 OF 004   Bank Melli Iran, and currently has a close business relationship with the Xalq Bank, a medium-sized bank in Baku.  He came to Azerbaijan after going bankrupt in Iran under murky circumstances.  He is wealthy and reportedly works closely with the Iranian "Foundation for the Oppressed" (Banyadeh Mostazafan), overseeing its business and investment activities in Azerbaijan, and advising the management of the Foundation-owned Darya Soap Detergent company in Azerbaijan (headed by one "Farzandeh").  He also assists another Iranian foundation that is providing financial assistance to Azerbaijani refugees from Karabagh with up to 300 Manat per family per month (about $350).  An Iranian contact said that a friend had recently witnessed Sharabiani delivering five million dollars in cash "from Iran" to the Bank of Baku that was not entered on the books. The Iranian source did not know whether the money represented a personal payment to Sharabiani or a disbursement entrusted to him for some other purpose.  The anti-regime source alleged that Sharabiani "periodically" makes such deliveries to the Bank.  An Iranian businessman separately told Iran watcher that Sharabiani has "very good relations" with the Iranian government, and is widely assumed by other Iranians to be assisting both regime organizations and individual regime/clerical figures in investment and money laundering activities.  Note: The Xalq Bank was established using former staff of the Bank of Baku (see 'E" below).  It is one of the most popular Baku banking venues in Azerbaijan for Iranian businesses and Iranians in Iran.  Two other popular banks for Iranians are the "Royal Bank of Baku," owned by an Iranian-American (ref C), and the "Bank of Baku."  End Note).  D.  (S) Kamal Darvishi.  This individual and his three brothers were famous fighters during the Iran-Iraq war. Kamil  rose to the rank of General in the Revolutionary Guard, and formerly had important Teheran-area security and intelligence duties.  He and his brother Keyoumars began coming to Azerbaijan regularly ten years ago.  Although from a very poor family, they are both extremely wealthy.  Kamal owns several road and other infrastructure construction companies in Iran, and formerly effectively controlled much of this sector in Iran (according to a Teheran businessman, "no roads in Iran could be built without him or his friends as a partner.)"  Darvishi formerly ran the "NASR" company, an alleged Revolutionary Guard-controlled business in Iran.  Some of his business activities and networking reportedly aroused suspicion, resulting in his official "retirement" from the Revolutionary Guard.  In recent years Darvishi has developed a close business relationship/friendship with Azerbaijan Minister of Transportation Ziya Mammedov, and  with Mammedov's assistance has won at least eight major road construction and rehabilitation contracts, including contracts for construction of the Baku-Iranian Astara highway, the Baku-Guba highway, and the BaQ ring highway. (Comment: We assume Mammedov is a silent partner in these contracts.  Mammedov's immediate family owns Azerbaijan's largest commercial development company, and he is notoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.  Iran watcher has heard many allegations from Azerbaijani contacts of creative corrupt practices involving highway construction here.  End Comment).   Iranian business and student contacts asserted that Darvishi maintains close relations with the Revolutionary Guard and Iranian intelligence.  Two noted that he travels freely abroad, in violation of ten-year legal limitations on personal foreign travel by retired senior Revolutionary Guard officers.  An Iranian student reported that Darvishi is recruiting among Iranian students in Azerbaijan for work in a new company he is establishing here.  E.  (S) Jamsheed "Jushkar" Mahmudoglu. He and his brothers are Iranian Azerbaijanis who have obtained Turkish citizenship.  They are large shareholders in the Bank of Baku, which is sometimes presented as a "Turkish bank."  They are originally from Tabriz, where the family were wealthy gold and currency dealers who lost their business after the Iranian Revolution.  The family fled to Turkey and ultimately  BAKU 00000175  003 OF 004   obtained Turkish passports.  Their business deals in Azerbaijan and Iran are frequently entwined with the Oromi brothers, another former Tabrizi-now-Turkish family active in Azerbaijan and Iran.  They and the Oromis set up the Silsila General Trading company in Dubai under the aegis of the NAB Group.  In Iran they jointly own a company which produces boilers on license from a German company (Bosch).  In Azerbaijan they cooperated in the establishment of the Baku Electronics company and the Bank of Baku (the latter in partnership with the family of former Minister of Economic Development Farhad Aliyev, see below).  Unlike the Oromis, Jamsheed reportedly remains a major shareholder in this bank.  Two Iranian sources repeated "rumors" that this son is working with a son of Ayatollah Rafsanjani in several business ventures.  Jamsheed has relations with prominent Azerbaijani and Iranian business and government figures, and allegedly does favors for Iranian government personnel, including facilitating of desired foreign items and money laundering.  The President of AmCham in Baku (protect) confirmed that Jamsheed is a major bank shareholder, and originally from Iran.  She nd other sources opined that the bank is one of he more "professionally run" in Baku. (Comment: The bank is known for its relations with Turkish companies.  The Bank of Baku was formerly controlled by the brother of Farhad Aliyev, a former Azerbaijani Minister of Economic Development who is currently jailed.  According to a prominent Azerbaijani business consultant (strictly protect), Aliyev's position has been divided between the Azerbaijani Minister of Transportation Ziya Mammedov, and the Head of Presidential Security, Vahid Akhundov.  End Comment).  F.  (S) Shahram Oromi.  An Iranian Azerbaijani who obtained Turkish citizenship after the Iranian revolution. Nonetheless, he attended university in Iran, graduating from Iran Azad university (1993).  He and his brothers Nadir and Bahram established the "Turkish" NAB Foreign Trade company (Deesh Ticaret Limited Sherkati) in 1988.  The company (headquartered in Istanbul) does extensive trading between Turkey and the Middle East and Iran.  It is active in Azerbaijan, and also present in Russia and other CIS countries.  Since 1995 this company has been the distributor of Hyundai cars in Azerbaijan, and a member of the family is reportedly the Agent for Samsung in Turkey and Azerbaijan. The consultant describes the Oromi brother's business mode as based on "establishing insider monopolies or advantages via relations with powerful government individuals and their relatives" in the various countries in which they operate, "using bribes, 'gifts,' or offers of a share in their business."  The Oromis helped set up the Bank of Baku (see item "E' above), and Shahram served in various positions (ranging from Chief of the Financial Audit Department to Chairman) between 1999-2007, however they have recently sold most of their shares in this bank to influential Azerbaijanis.  The Oromi's allegedly work cooperatively in areas requested by senior Iranian figures, and several of their businesses may facilitate regime (or regime member) interests.  Shahram was and remains close to former Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Ahmed Qazai.  G.  (S) "Asgar" LNU (commonly known in Baku as "Agaya Asgar).  His private company is located at #16 Gorbanov Street in Baku, next to the Nizami metro station.  His formal business is Iran-Russia timber and wood products export/import via Azerbaijan.  A native of Iranian Azerbaijan, Asgar has an Azerbaijani wife and has lived in Baku for several years. He works closely with political officers based at the Iran Culture House (ref B).  His wife is the cousin of the Azerbaijani Minister of Education Misir Mardanov, and Mardanov's brother is one of his business partners.  Irada Afetgizi, an Iranian who helped organize an anti-Israel "Islamic world" conference held at the Baku Media Center in 2007, works in his office.  Asgar owns two homes in Baku and hosts visiting Iranian clerics and relatives of Iranian regime officials and senior Revolutionary Guard officers.  He has close ties to Iranian government and Revolutionary Guard organizations and individuals, and assists them in business activities.  He often travels to Moscow.  H.  (S) Jabrail Naveed "Azerbaijani."  A famous "fixer" for  BAKU 00000175  004 OF 004   Iranians in Azerbaijan (hence his nickname).  He was head of the Iranian Trader's Association in Azerbaijan until that organization closed in the late 1990's.  An Iranian manufacturer and exporter from Tehran who has known the family for years (strictly protect) noted that "he is very wealthy, but doesn't flaunt it."  He said that Naveed's wife formerly worked in Iran as an officer in Bank Melli, where she facilitated loans to unqualified regime bigwigs and their cronies.  Three contacts separately claimed that Naveed has facilitated Iran-related energy business ventures with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), and illicitly exports (falsely labeled) Pelite and other oil drilling materials and chemicals and propane gas.  Naveed also reportedly owns the "Pingvin" iron workshop in Azerbaijan.  The Tehran businessman said that Naveed helps facilitate import of sanctioned products into Iran from Russia and elsewhere via the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakchevan, and said that he himself is one of "many" legitimate Iranian exporters who have been pressured into cooperating in this activity. Naveed is a close friend of the head of Baku's Husseiniya ("Iranian") mosque, Mullah Ogagnejad, and oversees the mosques' administration.  Ogagnejad is a son-in-law of the late Ayatollah Meshkini, and the personal religious representative of Ayatollah Khameini in Azerbaijan (ref B).  I.  (S) Safa Naveed.  Son of Jabrail Naveed (above).  A graduate of Baku's Kavkaz university, he is currently a Revolutionary Guard officer working at the Iranian Embassy in Baku.  He is a leadliaison with Iranian students in Azerbaijan.  AnIranian student described Safa's duties as "spyig on" Iranian students in Baku, and an Iranian businessman who has known the family for years told Iran watcher that Safa Naveed has frequently boasted to him about his and Iran's knowledge of what goes on in Azerbaijan, extensive information networks here, and "ability to get anything it needs."  One contact described Safa as "fanatically anti-Western."  J.  (S) Asgar Jabbari.  One of the "two Asgars" widely known among Iranians in Baku (see "F" above).  Son of the late "Mullah Natiq," a famous hard-line orator during the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war.  Jabbari's wife is from Azerbaijan, he owns a house here, and travels back and forth regularly between Iran and Azerbaijan.  His main official business is exporting Iranian marble from Isfahan, where he works with a large factory, which is actually a Revolutionary Guard front company (Note: Iranian marble is commonly used in Baku residential and office-building construction, which has been undergoing a boom here until recently.  End Note.) Jabbari has close business relationships with senior Iranian government officials, and carries out business activities and buys real estate on their behalf.  (Note: Jabbari's name is of Arabic origin, but is more likely to imply religious piety than Arabic heritage.  End Note).  K.  (S) Sabir Shaheen.  Though reportedly mild-mannered and well dressed, Shaheen is a well known mafia-like figure from Iranian Azerbaijan who reportedly acts as a "liaison" between the Iranian and Russian/Azerbaijani narcotics traffickers. Although he officially operates a marble store on Baku's Karl Marx street, the store is generally closed and Shaheen himself is generally seen holding court at restaurants and cafes along 28 May Street.  (Note: Iran reportedly has one of the highest per capita rates of heroin addiction in the world, and heroin and other narcotics trafficking from Iran to Russia and Europe via Azerbaijan has skyrocketed over the last two years.

(S)  A well-connected Iranian businessman who owns a Baku-based oil services company told Baku Iran watcher that a company called "INSULTEC," owned by UK citizens of Indian origin, has secretly provided cladding, thermal insulation, and ancillary equipment to the government of Iran in a variety of shipments via Turkey and the U.A.E.  According to the Baku source, whose company operates in Russia, Kazakhstan, and the U.A.E. as well as Azerbaijan, the materials allegedly sent by INSULTEC in falsely labeled containers were of type that could be used in nuclear reactor construction.  Citing old Iran and Dubai based business friends allegedly familiar with the issue, the source said that INSULTEC has maintained a sanctions-evading relationship with Iranian government companies for some time.  Source said that the company was officially headquartered in the U.K., and has offices in Germany, the USA, and elsewhere, its manufacturing base and the bulk of its staff are in India.  2.  (S) Perhaps more disturbingly, the source (who had just returned from ten days in Dubai) said that he had been informed by an Iranian friend who had collaborated in the activity that INSULTEC recently helped facilitate a shipment from the UAE to Iran consisting of twelve containers (possibly labeled "insulation") of unknown material that may not have actually originated with INSULTEC.  The source sai he was told by his friend that the shipment went by ship to Bandar Abbas and was trucked immediately to a final destination in Busheir.  The friend told source that another Iranian destination was falsely listed in the shipping documents, presumably to hide the actually intended destination of Busheir.  3.  (S) The Baku businessman is a UK-educated engineer from a prominent Pre-Revolution Isfahan family, and formerly owned a large factory in Iran.  He is a former national fencing champion of Iran. former President of the Iran Fencing Association, and Vice-President of an Azerbaijan sports association.  He has been based in Baku for more than ten years, working primarily as a sub-contractor to BP and the Cape Industrial Services company.  While his oil services company includes an insulation division that may be in competition with INSULTEC, source has provided "inside" information on many other Iranian issues (including comprehensive data on the status of new Iranian oil refinery construction) that does not relate to his private interests in any way.  4.  (S) Note: A quick google check revealed several companies with the name INSULTEC in the title - these may or not be affiliated.  Based on the information provided by source (currently in Iran, where he frequently travels), one possible candidate could be "INSULTEC Chitral Ltd."    End Note.   DERSE

(C) Iran view from Baku is the first in an occasional series from Embassy Baku Iran Watcher that will report on short and/or partially documented items of interest to Iran information consumers, but not necessarily warranting separate cables. This cable includes information on reported increasing security problems in Iranian Baluchistan, including alleged disruption of Iran-Pakistan railroad links; a message from a senior GOAJ military offical about the dangers of stirring up Iranian minorities; the apparent quadrupling in first quarter 2009 (compared to first quarter 2008) seizures in Azerbaijan of Iranian- transited heroin; and skepticism about Iranian gas export contracts, related by industry participants at the recently-completed Baku Oil and Gas show. End Summary.Baluchi Violence Obstructing Iran-Pakistan Rail Link?--------------------------------------------- ------- 2. (C) Several Iranian contacts, including apolitical businessmen, have told Baku Iran watcher that the recent suicide bombing of a Shia mosque, and subsequent attack on a campaign center in Zahedan, reflect a surge in Baluchi violence in the border area and inside Pakistan that has been building steadily over several years. According to one source, the Iranian security forces may be losing effective control over growing areas in the countryside. All noted that the rising violence in Iranian Baluchistan is mirrored and influenced by similar events on the Pakistani side of the border (recently described in ref(a)).3. (C) One alleged result is the apparent postponement of completion of the long-planned improved rail link between Pakistan and Iran, designed to run through or near Baluchi territory on both sides of the border. The current rail connection, running between Quetta, Pakistan and Zahedan, Iran is in poor condition and has low freight-carrying capacity. Moreover, according to reports it has recently been repeatedly subject to rocket attacks and other disruption by Baluchi tribes. An improved link also traversing Iranian and Pakistani Baluchi areas was originally supposed to have been inaugurated in March, 2009, with container train service beginning in August. According to Iranian sources in Baku, this deadline is unlikely to be achieved, and regular use of the Iran-Pakistan railway for significant cargo shipment is unlikely in the foreseeable future.4. (S)[Source removed] quoted the Ministry source as saying that in 2008 Iran asked Pakistan to establish a new, more secure and modern route, but that Pakistan has so far refused. The source added that Tehran is rife with rumors about the increasing lack of safety in Baluchi areas, and claimed that many guard and police posts in Sistan-Baluchistan areas are no longer occupied at night due to the increased danger of attack.5. (C) Another source, [Source removed] blamed the Ahmadinejad administration for pursuing provocative anti-Sunni practices (including harassment of Sunni clergy and congregations and raids on Sunni mosques) and other arrogant crackdowns over the last few years. He claimed that these practices, combined with high unemployment, perceived discrimination,BAKU 00000478 002.2 OF 003SUBJECT: IRAN VIEW FROM BAKU: VIOLENCE IN BALUCHISTAN REDUCING BORDER SECURITY; GOAJ OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST MANIPULATION OF IRANS MINORITIES; IRAN TRANSIT-ORIGIN HEROIN SEIZURES RISE; ALLEGED PROBLEMS WITH IRANIAN GAS EXPORT DEALSand few government services, has increased anger among Baluchis, and identification of the central government as an enemy. He cited the appointment of Ahmadinejad ally Habibullah Dehmordah as a Governor of Sistan-Baluchistan as a typical insensitive blunder, calling him a stupid, brutal, Sunni-hater. (Note: Dehmordah was replaced as Governor in 2008 by Ali-Mohammed Azad. End Note).GOAJ Military Figure Opposes Promoting Unrest in Iran--------------------------------------------- -------- 6. (S) At a 12 May meeting with a visiting group of 16 U.S. military general officers, the GOAJs Special Assistant to the President for Defense, General Vahid Aliyev, related that he had recently met in Iranian Azerbaijan with (unnamed) high-ranking  General.8 Although he did not provide details, Aliyev strongly implied that the Iranian General raised alleged foreign-sponsored efforts to foment unrest among Iranian ethnic groups, including Iranian Azerbaijanis (who make up nearly thirty percent of the Iranian population). Commenting on this issue, Aliyev asserted that there have been four attempts by Iranian Azerbaijanis to assert autonomy in the last hundred years, all of which were crushed by the Iranian state. As an example, Aliyev cited the Soviet effort during World War II to establish a breakaway Republic of South Azerbaijan. The Soviets forces pulled back in 1946, after a Truman-Stalin Agreement, which Aliyev depicted as a cynical betrayal of collaborating Iranian Azerbaijanis. He recounted that the resulting repression by Tehran resulted in the deaths of 60,000 Azeris, and the flight of many more into Soviet Azerbaijan.7. (S) U.S. military participants agreed that Aliyev appeared to be implicitly signaling that outside fomenting of unrest in Iranian Azerbaijan is opposed by the GOAJ. Aliyev similarly told the U.S. officers that any foreign war with Iran will be bad for Azerbaijan, and result in a flood of refugees entering the country. (Note: The three other failed Azerbaijani autonomy struggles cited by Aliyev presumably refer to the early 20th century Constitutional Revolution, Azerbaijani resistance to Reza Shahs centralization policies in the 1920s, and efforts by senior Azerbaijani clerics and activists to obtain local autonomy in the wake of the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

(C) According to [Source removed], export of narcotics from Iran into Azerbaijan continue to skyrocket (see ref b). According to statistics provided to Baku Iran watcher on June 3, 2009 by the UNODC-sponsored counter-narcotics Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) headquarters in Tashkent, Iran-origin heroin seizures (i.e., heroin derived from Afghani and Pakistani opium that entered Azerbaijan from Iran) in Azerbaijan nearly quadrupled during the first quarter of 2009, as compared to the first quarter of 2008. According to the GOAJ, virtually all of this heroin had been fully processed in labs and was ready for market. Total heroin seizures in Azerbaijan during the first quarter of 2008 reflected a sharp increase over the first quarter of 2007; while in 2006 only twenty kilograms of such heroin was officially reported seized in Azerbaijan during the entire year. In contrast, reported GOAJ seizures of Iran-origin heroin during the first quarter of 2009 amounted to nearly 59,000 kilos, as compared to approximately 15,000 kilos of heroin seized in the first quarter of 2008.Projected Problems in Iranian Gas Links--------------------------------------- 9. (C) The annual Baku Oil and Gas Show, held June 2-5, brought a variety of energy company executives and pundits to Baku, though no senior officials from Iran. An AmericanBAKU 00000478 003.2 OF 003SUBJECT: IRAN VIEW FROM BAKU: VIOLENCE IN BALUCHISTAN REDUCING BORDER SECURITY; GOAJ OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST MANIPULATION OF IRANS MINORITIES; IRAN TRANSIT-ORIGIN HEROIN SEIZURES RISE; ALLEGED PROBLEMS WITH IRANIAN GAS EXPORT DEALSinterlocutor told Baku Iran Watcher on the side of the show that a [Source removed] had confided to him in a private conversation on June 4 that he viewed near-term implementation of the Iranian-Pakistani gas link project as very unlikely. The downbeat comment by the [Source removed] was made despite the recent signing in Istanbul by President Ahmadinejad and President Zardari of an Iranian-Pakistani MOU committing to the gas project. According to this source, [Source removed] indicated that he had several reasons for this opinion, but the only one he elaborated was that the Pakistanis dont have the money to pay for either the pipeline, or the gas.10. (C) Meanwhile, during a panel discussion at the conference on the future prospects of Caspian gas, several commentators noted the difficulty of doing business in unpredictable, overly bureaucratic Iran, and the alleged historical unreliability of Iranian gas supply contracts previously reached with Turkey and Turkmenistan. For example, panelists recounted that, after long negotiations, Iran has four times failed to sign separate Liquid national Gas contracts at the last minute. Two panelists claimed that Iran has repeatedly diverted gas supplies to meet domestic needs, thereby interrupting its contractual gas exports - and has not paid contractual penalties for these violations.11. (C) A [Source removed] asserted bluntly that Iranian political leaders are totally focused on domestic needs and personal jockeying, and are simply not interested in hearing about the value of optimizing foreign gas exports. The only exception, he claimed, is their interest in the notional prospect of annually exporting ten billion cubic meters (bcms) of gas to Europe. He attributed this interest to a conviction that such a deal will significantly increase Irans political leverage in Europe and substantially insulate it from future European pressure - a perception he characterized as revealing, and typically unrealistic.DERSE

Reasons 1.4 (b/d).  Summary -------  1. (C) At the regular meeting of G-5 Ambassadors in Beijing May 8, French DCM Nicholas Chapuis reported that State Councilor Dai Bingguo told visiting former French President Chirac that the West would not gain from more sanctions on North Korea.  Dai reportedly said that "the lever of economic development" had not been used effectively in Six-Party Talks and that a U.S.-DPRK dialogue was "the only way to make progress."  German Ambassador Michael Schaefer reported that Germany had informed China of the U.S. request to accept some Uighur detainees held at Guantanamo and had been subsequently warned by China of "a heavy burden on bilateral relations" if Germany were to accept any detainees.  Japanese DCM Kunio Umeda reported that Premier Wen Jiabao was "tired and seemed under a lot of pressure" during his meeting with visiting Prime Minister Taro Aso, while President Hu Jintao was "relaxed and confident."  According to UK DCM Chris Wood, China had requested the UK not allow the Dalai Lama to transit London or meet with any government officials.  Wood reported that local authorities in Gansu Province had detained a British Consul, reflecting the authorities' angst over foreigners traveling to the Tibetan regions of the province.  End Summary.  Participants ------------  2. (C) French DCM Nicholas Chapuis hosted German Ambassador Dr. Michael Schaefer, Japanese DCM Kunio Umeda, UK DCM Chris Wood and Acting DCM May 8 for the regular gathering of Beijing-based G-5 Chiefs of Mission.  Chirac's Visit to China, DPRK, Africa -------------------------------------  3. (C) French DCM Nicholas Chapuis reported that President Hu had not mentioned Tibet in his meeting with visiting former French President Jacques Chirac.  State Councilor Dai Bingguo had told Chirac that the West would not gain from more sanctions on North Korea and that a U.S.-DPRK dialogue was "the only way to make progress" in Six-Party Talks.  Dai reportedly said that North Korea wanted to open up economically and that the "lever of economic development" had not been used effectively in Six-Party Talks.  Dai suggested to Chirac that, given China and France's "conflict of interests" in Africa, the two countries should have a dialogue on Africa.  Germany and Guantanamo Uighurs ------------------------------  4. (C) German Ambassador Schaefer said the German State Secretary had informed China of the U.S. request to accept some Uighur detainees held at Guantanamo, noting that Germany had not made a decision regarding the Uighurs.  He noted that no German state had yet agreed to accept the detainees. Ambassador Schaefer said China had not officially demarched Germany but had warned Germany that accepting any Uighur detainees would "put enormous pressure on Beijing and a heavy burden on bilateral relations."  Sino-Japanese Relations -----------------------  5. (C) Japanese DCM Kunio Umeda reported that PM Taro Aso, who had visited Beijing April 29-30, had said Premier Wen Jiabao was "very tired and seemed under a lot of pressure" from dealing with the economic crisis, while President Hu Jintao had seemed "confident and relaxed."  PM Aso had requested China not implement its planned compulsory certification of IT products in China, while Premier Wen had insisted the law was consistent with China's WTO commitments.  Dalai Lama ----------  6. (C) UK DCM Chris Wood reported that China had requested the UK not allow the Dalai Lama to transit London but softened the demarche by requesting that government officials not meet the Dalai Lama if he were to transit the country. French DCM Nicholas Chapuis said China's demarche was part of  BEIJING 00001247  002 OF 002   a campaign to limit the Dalai Lama's travel and noted that the Beijing city government had threatened to break its sister-city relationship with Paris if the Dalai Lama were to receive an honorary citizen award from the French capital. Ambassador Schaefer said Germany had not received such demands from the Chinese, in spite of the Dalai Lama's frequent trips to Germany.  Harassment of UK Embassy Staff in Gansu ---------------------------------------  7. (C) UK DCM Wood said UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband had recently visited Gansu Province and had been accompanied by a British journalist from "The Guardian."  According to Woodward, local Chinese authorities had briefly detained a British Consul to express displeasure with the accompanying journalist, who had stayed in Gansu without the authorities' permission after Secretary Miliband had departed.  "Local goons" had come to the traveling delegation's hotel and threatened to follow a UK Embassy female staffer (but did not).  In addition, a British "Financial Times" reporter in Sichuan had been harassed by local authorities who were apparently upset by the journalist's interest in reporting on schools destroyed during the Sichuan earthquake.  Climate Change --------------  8. (C) UK DCM Wood said the UK Environment and Science Minister had recently had talks with Chinese officials on climate change.  In the lead up to Copenhagen, China would not agree to targets on emissions but was willing to be constructive and would come to Copenhagen with a package of action items related to nuclear power, renewable energy and reforestation.  Wood said his impression was that China could be induced to do more on climate change.  Rule of Law -----------  9. (C) Ambassador Schaefer reported that German Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries recently had visited China to attend a three-day rule of law dialogue on social security and pensions that was attended by 45 Chinese lawyers and judges. Schaefer said Germany and China would have another dialogue on a proposed law on regulating lawyers, noting that the Chinese Government was looking to give lawyers "more space" without giving up control.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 002438  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/25/2029 TAGS: PREL PARM ENRG PTER MNUC IR CHSUBJECT: PRC/IRAN: SCHOLAR SUGGESTS U.S. NEGOTIATE SE CRETLY WITH IRAN  REF: BEIJING 1803  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson.  Reasons 1. 4 (b/d).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  The unstable post-election political climate in Iran likely precludes the initiation of formal negotiations with Iran on ceasing its uranium enrichment program, according to a PRC scholar.  Though Iran is sincere in wishing to reach out to the United States on broader bilateral issues, it remains wary of "falling into a trap" in bilateral negotiations.  Under these circumstances, the scholar suggests, the United States should undertake "se cret" talks with Iran that would entail a U.S. concession allowing Iran some nuclear enrichment activities in return for Iran's adherence to a strict IAEA safeguard agreement, its cessation of support for Hamas and Hizbollah, and cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan.  China has encouraged Iran to enter into negotiations with the United States, according to our contact, while the United States is involved in regional conflicts where Iran could play a positive role. However, the scholar stressed, pressing for additional sanctions through the P5-plus-1 mechanism would be counterproductive and put China in a "difficult position" of having to side with either the United States or Iran.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the MFA-affiliated China Institute for International Studies (CIIS) and frequent media commentator on Middle East issues Li Guofu told PolOff August 24 that though the unexpected turmoil surrounding the June 12 Iranian election had politically weakened both President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, both they and opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi were "one side of a coin" in that none of them supported the suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment activities.  Post-Election Atmosphere Not Right for Negotiations --------------------------------------------- ------  3. (C) Li argued that Ahmadinejad's congratulatory letter sent to President Obama following the 2008 U.S. elections had been a sincere indication of the Iranian leadership's willingness to talk.  Li said he had learned that former Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati had discreetly contacted USG officials prior to the June 12 presidential election in Iran, agreeing to resume bilateral contacts after the election concluded, but that the turmoil and the lingering instability in Iran had prevented movement on that initiative.  Li reported that his contacts in Iran had recently said that the Iranian political climate post-election was still not stable enough for the leadership to engage in public negotiations on the nuclear issue.  "Obama Factor" --------------  4. (C) Li said an additional factor adding to the Iranian leadership's reticence to reach out to the United States was President Obama's positive image among the Iranian public. ("Obama is with us," was an example of public sentiment reported to him by his Iranian contacts.)  Despite the fact that the leadership was satisfied with President Obama's statements after the June election, Iranian leaders were wary of "falling into a trap" in negotiations with United States. Li suggested that Khamenei remained suspicious of the United Kingdom, France and Germany based on the Iranian leadership's perception that these countries had played a role in stirring post-election turmoil.  Grand Bargain in the Works? ---------------------------  5. (C) Li stated that Iran agreeing to suspend uranium enrichment unilaterally or completely was a "non-starter." Li cited unnamed contacts in the United States "with close access to policy-makers on Iran" to support his belief that the United States would be willing to accept some internationally-supervised uranium enrichment by Iran.  This would be a concession, Li said, that "the Europeans would have great difficulty accepting."  To make such a concession diplomatically palatable, Li continued, the United States in return would expect Iran's cessation of support for Hamas and Hizbollah, among other terrorist groups in the region, and its cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In addition, Li suggested, the United States would expect Iran to agree to a stricter IAEA safeguard agreement that would control Iran's nuclear activities and include terms that would be integrated into the NPT as a basis for further safeguards governing all  BEIJING 00002438  002 OF 002   NPT signatory countries (reftel).  He stated that before agreeing to a low level of Iranian enrichment activity, the United States would insist Iran implement a six-to-twelve-month freeze on nuclear enrichment activities.  6. (C) Li stressed that any Iranian nuclear program negotiations, which he believed would be lengthy, should be "se cret" and seek to produce a "win/win" scenario for both countries.  Li stated that Iran had doubts about the USG's ability to enter such a bargain, given U.S. political pressures, and that to the Iranians, a signal of U.S. sincerity to move forward might come through an unofficial visit along the lines of Henry Kissinger's late June trip to China to discuss North Korea sanctions or former President Clinton's early August visit to Pyongyang to effect the release of the two American journalists, which in his view had allowed the atmosphere for negotiations with the DPRK to improve.  Li suggested that former President Clinton could perhaps secure the release of the American hikers detained by Iranian authorities.  Li stated that the key element of a Kissinger visit would be the former Secretary of State's ability to have discreet, private and informal discussions.  China Urges Iran to Reach Out to the United States --------------------------------------------- -----  7. (C) Despite U.S.-Iranian tensions, the PRC had encouraged Iran to take advantage of current circumstances to mend ties with the United States, according to Li, arguing that the United States would be more open to making concessions now because it was in a relatively weaker position tending to a number of trouble spots around the world, including the Middle East and South Asia, and needed Iran's help in Iraq and Afghanistan.  However, as the United States regained its position of strength, according to Li, its willingness to make concessions would disappear.  Li reported that MFA West Asian and North African Affairs Department Director General Song Aiguo had affirmed to him recently that China "would do whatever it could" to assist communication between the United States and Iran.  Asked whether Iran viewed China as a fair broker, Li said, "Iran trusts nobody."  While Iran understood China's interests in Iran, the Iranian leadership believed that when pushed to make a choice, China would side with the United States over Iran.  P5 plus 1: A Show for Public Consumption ----------------------------------------  8. (C) Li stated that the P5-plus-1 process "was for public consumption" and that expectations of its success should be minimal.  Acknowledging the increasing pressure for additional sanctions given Iran's current unresponsiveness to offers of engagement, Li stated that pushing for additional sanctions would play to the hard-liners' advantage in Iran and not bring any change in Iranian behavior.  In addition, the prospect of imposing additional sanctions would put China in a "difficult position" of choosing between its interests vis-a-vis the United States and Iran, a choice it hoped to avoid.

Reasons 1.4 (b/d).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  China is biding its time until the political crisis in Iran reaches a clearer resolution and the Ahmadinejad government consolidates power, and will signal its renewed engagement by sending a high-level delegation to Tehran once the political situation has been resolved, according to an MFA official.  Our contact reaffirmed China's commitment to the P5-plus-1 process and assessed that Iran is attempting to keep the door to negotiation with the United States open despite the turmoil surrounding the June election, but cautioned that a complete halt to uranium enrichment is an unattainable goal.  China continues to urge Iran to respond positively to the P5-plus-1 offer for talks, and these entreaties have been passed directly to Supreme Leader Khamenei.  Iran reportedly requested to upgrade its relationship with Beijing to a "strategic partnership," but China refused.  A Communist Party official told us that the CCP is seeking to increase its relations with six major political parties and factions in Iran and deepen its understanding of U.S. policy in the Middle East.  He repeated China's standard position on the Iran nuclear issue and suggested that the U.S. offer economic incentives to persuade the Iranians to enter into talks on the nuclear issue.  He dismissed concerns that negative perceptions in the Middle East of China after the July violence in Xinjiang province would affect China's diplomacy with Iran.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) PolOff discussed Iran-China relations with MFA West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division Deputy Director Ni Ruchi August 31.  In a separate meeting the same day, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee International Liaison Department (CCID) Third Bureau (West Asia and North Africa) Director Wu Baocai gave PolOff the Party's perspective on Iran and the nuclear issue.  Holding Back Bilaterally until Political Dust Settles --------------------------------------------- --------  3. (C) MFA Iran Division Deputy Director Ni said that the political turmoil in Iran had yet to settle and that China was still waiting for the situation to calm further before re-engaging fully in bilateral relations.  He argued that the internal divisions that had played out in the June presidential elections had existed well before the violent aftermath of the June election.  China had been aware of the potential for conflict among those divisions to spill into the street and had taken a cautious approach before the election.  He said that the Chinese government understood that the election was a strong indication of deep-seated divisions within the Iranian government, but stressed that the contested election had not fundamentally undermined the current government and that China would continue with its normal engagement with Tehran.  4. (C) China would signal its re-engagement, Ni reported, with a high-level delegation to Tehran, but there was no timetable for such a visit yet because the leadership in Tehran was still fully focused on consolidating power.  He noted that during his mid-August visit to Iran, protestors had continued to take to the streets to express dissatisfaction with the election.  Ni reaffirmed China's commitment to the P5-plus-1 process, stressing that the U.S. and China not only had common interests in Iran, but the scope of this common interest was increasing.  Iran Keeping the Door Open? ---------------------------  5. (C) Ni said that China had taken note of efforts by the Iranian government to keep a path open to direct negotiations despite the ongoing political turmoil.  He claimed that Tehran had refrained from overplaying its accusations of the U.S. role in the election turmoil, preferring to point the finger at European countries, indicating that the Iranian leadership was interested in maintaining the possibility of direct talks.  Ni said that the election had caused the Iranian leadership to reexamine seriously its foreign policy, particularly on the nuclear issue, adding that Iran's nuclear development had suffered technical setbacks recently, which had also forced the leadership to consider how to move forward.  China Lobbying but Total Halt to Enrichment Unattainable --------------------------------------------- -----------  6. (C) Ni reported that China continued to urge Iran at every level of their engagement to respond positively to the P53-plus-1 offer of direct talks and cease uranium enrichment  BEIJING 00002494  002 OF 002   activities.  He said that Chinese leaders had pointed out to their Iranian counterparts on many occasions that the United States had shown "restraint" in its public comments during the June election aftermath, and that Iran was missing an important opportunity by refusing to respond to the P5-plus-1 offer.  Ni said that China's message encouraging greater engagement had been passed directly to Supreme Leader Khamenei.  He cautioned that Tehran would not be able to respond positively to P5-plus-1 overtures until it had reinforced its position at home, and that a "100-percent" halt to uranium enrichment had become an unattainable goal. Ni said that China continued to believe that fresh sanctions would be ineffective in persuading Iran to cease enrichment activities and would be counter-productive by increasing the unity of the various factions in Iran behind the nuclear program and the current government.  Ni argued that the regime in Iran would emerge from the crisis in a weakened position and thus more likely to negotiate with the P5-plus-1 on the nuclear issue.  Iran Seeks "Strategic Partnership" with an Unwilling PRC --------------------------------------------- -----------  7. (C) Ni said that Iran had requested that Beijing upgrade its relationship with Tehran, presumably to counter Western pressure, by lobbying Beijing to label its relationship with Iran a "strategic partnership" as it does for Russia and other countries.  Ni said that China had so far refused to do so and Iran was frustrated with China's continuing insistence that the two countries shared merely "normal" relations.  Party Seeks to Increase its Interaction with Iran --------------------------------------------- ----  8. (C) CCP Central Committee International Liaison Department (CCID) Third Bureau (West Asia and North Africa) Director Wu Baocai told PolOff August 31 that the CCP was seeking to increase its relations with six major political parties and factions in Iran.  He noted that links between the CCP and Iranian political parties had lagged behind the growth in relations between executive branches and far behind the increase in economic links.  He said that deepening understanding among the CCP leadership of the U.S. position on Iran was another emerging priority for his office and that he was open to continued exchanges with the U.S. on the nuclear issue.  CCP Perspective on Iran Nuclear Program ---------------------------------------  9. (C) Wu said that CCP officials were increasingly concerned through 2008 at the possibility of the United States taking military action against Iran's nuclear program but assessed that such a possibility was much lower in 2009.  He noted that sanctions had not only failed to change Iranian behavior and create meaningful effects in Iran but were negatively affecting the countries joining in the international effort to persuade Iran to stop its nuclear activities, citing as an example constraints placed on Chinese banks from doing business with Iran.  He said that he believed the international community was unlikely to be able to persuade Iran to fully abandon its enrichment activities and suggested the U.S. offer modest economic benefits as an incentive to persuade Iran to enter into dialogue.  Wu reiterated China's strong opposition to Iran using its nuclear technology to develop nuclear weapons but stressed the right of all countries to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Iran Relations Unaffected by Xinjiang Violence --------------------------------------------- -  10. (C) Wu dismissed concerns that dismay in Iran and other parts of the Middle East over China's treatment of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang province would complicate China's diplomacy with Iran.  While acknowledging that some high-level religious leaders in Iran had been highly critical of China in the wake of the July violence in Xinjiang, he said that Beijing was seeking to counter the danger of China becoming a target for anger in the Muslim world by significantly increasing its media outreach in the Middle East, citing the recent establishment of an Arabic-language version of government-run CCTV.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 002932  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/22/2034 TAGS: PREL PARM ENRG PTER MNUC IR CHSUBJECT: PRC/IRAN: PREMIER WEN PUSHES RAHIMI ON DIALOGUE; CHINA URGES COOPERATION WITH IAEA, P5-PLUS-1  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson. Reasons 1.4 (b/d).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  On the margins of Shanghai Cooperation Organization high-level meetings October 15, PRC Premier Wen Jiabao urged Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi to move forward with direct talks with the United States and offered PRC support to do so, according to an MFA official.  Wen reportedly reiterated that Iran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology, but stressed China's opposition to Iranian development of nuclear weapons.  Our MFA contact claimed that China recognizes the importance of seizing the present opportunity and that the Iranian side did as well.  The PRC assesses that Iran's willingness to negotiate over the nuclear issue comes from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but the Iranian regime remains divided over the June election and its aftermath.  Our contact urged the U.S. to downplay sanctions and seek positive, even if symbolic, benefits to provide Iran in response to progress in the talks.  China has been pushing Iran to improve its cooperation with the IAEA and assesses that Iran will make good on its offer to allow inspectors into the Qom nuclear site.  Beijing believes that Iran's nuclear technology is not as advanced "as some believe."  Iranian Embassy officials in Beijing expressed satisfaction to the Chinese with the outcomes of the October 1 P5-plus-1-plus-Iran meeting and were particularly positive on the bilateral meeting with the U.S. side, according to the MFA.  Our contact argued that a constituency within Iranian society that advocates flexibility on the nuclear issue is a force in politics, but that the government will need any negotiations to accrue benefits to Iran given the strength of the conservative camp.  END SUMMARY.  Wen Pushes Iranian Vice President on Nuclear Issue --------------------------------------------- -----  2. (C) MFA West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division Deputy Director Ni Ruchi told PolOff October 21 that Premier Wen Jiabao's October 15 meeting with Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi had been brief due to the press of other issues at the SCO Summit.  Ni said that the Chinese side had raised the nuclear issue and urged Iran to cooperate with the international community.  Wen had pushed the Iranians to move forward with direct talks with the United States and offered Chinese support to do so.  Wen had stressed that while Iran had a right to the peaceful use of nuclear technology, China opposed Iran's development of nuclear weapons.  Ni claimed that Rahimi had responded positively on prospects for talks with the United States and said that the Iranians were considering how best to do move forward with dialogue.  Beijing Wants to Seize the Moment, as Does Tehran --------------------------------------------- ----  3. (C) Ni emphasized the importance for China of the October 1 bilateral talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva.  He noted that China had a very positive outlook for improved U.S. relations with Iran, a development that would be helpful for progress on the nuclear issue.  China recognized the importance of seizing the present opportunity, Ni said, given the poor long-term prospects for Iran to improve relations with the international community should progress fail to materialize in the near future.  He said that the Iranian side also understood the uniqueness of this opportunity and the importance of demonstrating progress.  He said that Beijing assessed that Iran was willing to make a deal with the U.S. on the nuclear issue, adding that this willingness came from the Supreme Leader, and that President Ahmadinejad was not the decision-maker on the issue.  Ni cautioned, however, that the Iranian regime remained divided over the June election and its aftermath, complicating efforts by the P5-plus-1 to negotiate with the regime.  Trust-Building a Priority for PRC ---------------------------------  4. (C) Ni stressed the need at present to find ways to increase Iran's trust in the intentions of the P5-plus-1.  He urged the United States to de-emphasize the push for additional sanctions and to seek positive, even if symbolic, benefits to give Iran in response to progress in the talks. He expressed concern that increased pressure from the international community would strengthen the consensus of hard-liners in the Iranian regime.  Ni reported that Iranian diplomats had claimed that while they had a high degree of confidence in President Obama's intentions, they remained suspicious about his ability to deliver on those intentions given political realities in the United States.  He argued that China's political efforts to persuade Iran to negotiate  BEIJING 00002932  002 OF 002   in good faith represented an important contribution to the P5-plus-1 effort to deal with the nuclear issue.  PRC Urges IAEA Cooperation, Downplays Technical Progress --------------------------------------------- -----------  5. (C) Ni said that China had been pushing Iran to improve its cooperation with the IAEA and take a positive attitude in order to allow the agency to develop trust in Iran's intentions.  Beijing understood that technical meetings at the IAEA this week had achieved progress, Ni said, adding that China hoped to see progress on the Tehran Research Reactor fuel proposal.  China assessed that Iran would allow inspectors into the Qom site, Ni said.  He stressed, too, that Iran's nuclear technology was not as advanced "as some believe," and that Iran's overall level of industrial development represented a serious impediment to development of nuclear technology and particularly to weaponization.  He noted that of the 5,000 centrifuges in Iran, less than half were actually in operation.  Iranian Side Upbeat on October 1 Meeting ----------------------------------------  6. (C) Ni said Iranian embassy contacts in Beijing had expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the October meeting in Geneva, calling the event a "success." Though concerned that sitting down with the U.S. would be "a mistake," the Iranians had left the U.S.-Iran bilateral meeting wanting to continue the process.  Ni suggested that some within the Iranian regime understood the need for a change in political direction, particularly after the difficult June election.  He also reported that the Iranians were putting renewed focus on creating an effective plan for economic development.  MFA: U.S. Should Incentivize, Reward Iranian Progress --------------------------------------------- --------  7. (C) On direct U.S.-Iran talks, Ni urged the U.S. side to make a clear statement abandoning the notion of regime change.  He suggested seeking a "cooperative partnership" with Iran on shared concerns such as security in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in doing so, recognizing Iran as a major regional power.  He recommended offering concrete and immediate benefits, especially economic incentives and a relaxation of existing sanctions, in response to positive overtures by the Iranian side.  These efforts could start small, he added, but should be focused on sending a clear signal of sincere intentions to Tehran.  Iranian Leadership Feels Street Pressure on Negotiations --------------------------------------------- -----------  8. (C) Ni reported that based on his travel to Iran, considerable debate was taking place among ordinary Iranians over the utility of the nuclear program.  Many Iranians did not see the use in having nuclear technology and saw it only as a source of problems, while others saw value in the possession of nuclear technology but were reconsidering this view because of progress in talks with the United States.  In contrast, a more conservative constituency in Iran was disinclined to make any concessions to the international community on the nuclear issue.  In light of this division in society, Ni argued, the Iranian leadership would not make concessions without meaningful and visible compensation. HUNTSMAN
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 003313  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/2034 TAGS: PREL PARM MNUC PGOV KN IR CHSUBJECT: UNDER SECRETARY BURNS MEETING WITH CCID DIRECTOR WANG JIARUI ON IRAN, NORTH KOREA  Classified By: Political Minster Counselor Aubrey Carlson.  Reasons 1.4  (b/d).  Summary -------  1. (C) Under Secretary Burns met with Director of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee International Liaison Department (CCID) Wang Jiarui December 9 to discuss U.S.-China cooperation on North Korea and Iran.  Wang said that the "ideal outcome" of Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Bosworth's current visit to Pyongyang would be a meeting with DPRK leader Kim Jong-il.  The very fact of the visit, Wang emphasized, was important because it sent a signal to the DPRK that the United States was serious about negotiating a settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.  The DPRK would be unwilling in the short run to publicly announce denuclearization or an immediate return to the Six-Party talks, but would not want to lose the opportunity presented by Ambassador Bosworth's visit.  The important thing was to keep things moving in the right direction and prevent the situation spinning out of control.  2. (C) Wang praised U.S. policy on Iran, calling it a "practical" approach.  He said China was in agreement with the United States "in principle" that Iran should not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons and that the consequences of such an event would have a negative impact on Chinese interests.  He also said that China would cooperate in persuading Iran to live up to the commitments it made at the October meeting in Geneva with the P5-plus-1 to resume discussions on the nuclear issue and allow third countries to reprocess its nuclear fuel.  However, Wang insisted, continued diplomacy, rather than military action or stronger sanctions, was the best option at present.  U/S Burns stressed the importance of China's cooperation and would not close the door on diplomacy but that U.S. patience was wearing thin and Iran had to soon show it was complying with international agreements or face real consequences.  End Summary.  China Pleased With Bosworth Visit to DPRK -----------------------------------------  3. (C) Asked his views on the North Korea nuclear situation, CCID Director Wang stated that China was very pleased that Ambassador Bosworth was in Pyongyang, noting that the visit would be "cost effective" because the North Koreans had made clear there could be no resuming the Six-Party Talks without first convening a bilateral U.S.-DPRK dialogue.  Ambassador Bosworth's visit effectively "kicked the ball" back to the North Koreans.  When asked what the likely outcome of the talks would be, Wang said the ideal outcome would be a meeting with Kim Jong-il, which would send a very positive signal, but it was impossible to predict North Korean behavior through "normal" means of reading public indicators.  Wang said that Ambassador Bosworth would likely meet with First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju, who was "a hardliner" with "strong views" and whose opinions were valued by the DPRK's top leaders.  However, Kang had to follow orders from above, Wang noted, and would not want to lose such an opportunity to improve relations with the United States.  The negotiations with Ambassador Bosworth would be a bargaining process, with each side trying to discern the other's bottom line.  4. (C) The North needed a breakthrough in its relations with the United States, Wang asserted, both because of its domestic situation and the current international environment, but it would not be easy for North Korea to make a specific promise regarding a return to the Six-Party Talks or to announce denuclearization.  Ambassador Bosworth's trip itself was important because it demonstrated that the United States was serious about preventing a nuclear Korean peninsula and was committed to a peaceful resolution of the issue.  Wang said China was aware that the United States worried that it would be deceived by the North but in China's view there was no need to worry because the current process of promoting dialogue and negotiations was quite transparent and the international community would know what the outcome would be.  5. (C) Wang reiterated China's long-standing position that the key objective at this stage was to prevent the situation on the Korean peninsula from spinning out of control and to establish a positive direction through dialogue and negotiation.  He said that Ambassador Bosworth should make clear to North Korea that it was not in U.S. interests to prolong the current state of hostility, that the United States had no intention of promoting regime change in the North, and that international sanctions and relations with the DPRK's neighbors could be changed and they could help  BEIJING 00003313  002 OF 003   with North Korea's economic development.  This was contingent upon a change in North Korean behavior and an eventual North Korean pledge to the world that it would not embark on the road to nuclear weapons.  U/S Burns responded that the United States understood the complexity of the situation and emphasized the great importance of joint U.S.-China and Five-Party efforts to bring North Korea back as soon as possible to the Six-Party Talks and its denuclearization commitments.  Unified U.S.-China Effort Needed on Iran ----------------------------------------  6. (C) U/S Burns emphasized that the nuclear weapons challenge in Iran required a similarly unified U.S.-China and international effort.  The United States was profoundly concerned about Middle East stability, which was crucial to both U.S. and Chinese security and economic interests.  If Iran continued developing a nuclear capability, Israel would "no doubt" act, and concern among the Arab states might trigger a regional arms race.  President Obama had repeatedly reached out to Iran's leaders, but had yet to receive a positive response.  Moreover, Iran had not followed through on the understandings reached in Geneva in October, including Iran's commitment to meet with the P5-plus-1 countries for talks focused on the nuclear issue and its initial acceptance of the IAEA's TRR proposal.  The United States would continue to take a diplomatic, creative and flexible approach working with our Russian, Chinese and European partners, but time was running short.  By the end of the year, President Obama would have to evaluate Iran's actions thus far.  If Iran did not live up to its agreements, the United States would work with its international partners to make clear to Iran the consequences of its unwillingness to engage seriously.  Wang Pledges Chinese Support... -------------------------------  7. (C) Wang had high praise for U.S. efforts in the Middle East in general and the approach to Iran in particular, stating that China viewed U.S. measures in Iran as very practical and as based on realities on the ground.  China had economic interests in Iran, but, in principle, China had no differences with the United States on the nuclear weapons issue.  China agreed that Iranian nuclear weapons would bring great instability to the Middle East, including possible warfare, even on a global scale, with consequences far greater than China's economic interests.  China agreed with the IAEA proposal and that Iran should live up to the commitments it made in Geneva, but unfortunately, Iran had not responded positively to this proposal despite many efforts by the United States, China, and the international community.  China had consistently told Iran that China strongly opposed Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.  This message, he claimed, has been conveyed in party-to-party and government-to-government meetings and in "all channels." However, Iran maintained it had no nuclear weapons and was simply pursuing the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  ...But Urges Continued Diplomacy --------------------------------  8. (C) Wang pressed U/S Burns for details on when the limits of U.S. patience might be exhausted and counseled further efforts to find a diplomatic solution.  Burns replied that U.S. patience was nearly exhausted.  Wang acknowledged that there was a potential for an Israeli military strike were the situation not handled properly, which was of grave concern to China, but insisted that harsh actions were not yet warranted.  Recent U.S. experience with a military option, he said, should teach some lessons, and the outcome of tougher sanctions was also unpredictable.  The United States needed to understand that Iran was not Iraq, and the best way forward was to continue to pursue peaceful dialogue and negotiations and to carefully examine previous diplomatic efforts to see what changes needed to be made.  North Korea and Iran Similarities ---------------------------------  9. (C) Wang also claimed similarities between the North Korea and Iran nuclear issues.  The solution in both cases was to persist over the long haul, continuing intensive efforts with the objective of ensuring that the situation did not spin out of control.  Wang noted that in his several recent visits to Iran anti-American sentiment was strong, everywhere, and palpable, which, he said, was not conducive to resolving the issue.  10. (C) Wang asked U/S Burns for his views on who made final decisions in Iran, President Ahmadinejad or Supreme Leader  BEIJING 00003313  003 OF 003   Khamenei.  He said it would be very helpful to China if the decision-making process in Iran could be sorted out.  Wang appeared to agree with the Under Secretary that Khamenei was the final arbiter of Iranian policy and concluded by stating that there might be a way for direct communication with the Supreme Leader.  He said direct engagement would avoid the distortions of message that occurred when communicating through an intermediary.  Wang noted that there was not one country in the international arena that supported Iran's quest for nuclear weapons and emphasized that there was a need for a unified international view on Iran.  11. (C) U/S Burns responded that the United States had made very clear its willingness for direct diplomacy, but that it took both sides to make direct communication work.  He emphasized that this was a core national security issue for the United States, which could not abide greater Middle East instability, and said the United States would continue its diplomatic efforts in a creative and flexible manner. However, he stated, at some point there had to be results and U.S. patience was fast running out.  U.S.-China Cooperation ----------------------  12. (C) Wang said China would continue to make its own efforts on the issue but China was willing to do more to cooperate with the United States to facilitate a resolution to the Iran nuclear problem.  He welcomed further U.S. suggestions on measures to achieve a breakthrough and asked what the United States would like China to do or whether there were areas in which China could make a contribution. U/S Burns emphasized that the United States would like to cooperate with China and needed to work closely with China to find a way to persuade Iran to make the right choices.  The current focus was on persuading Iran to live up to the commitments it made at the Geneva meetings on the TRR proposal and by meeting again soon on the nuclear issue.  The two P5-plus-1 tracks -- diplomacy and sanctions -- were not mutually exclusive.  The United States had tried many approaches to Iran in the past 11 weeks, and none had borne fruit.  The United States would not close the door on diplomacy, but as in the case of putting pressure on North Korea through UN Resolution 1874, we had to work together to apply pressure to get Iran back to the diplomatic track. Iran had to understand that it faced a clear choice.  Iran could choose to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which the United States supported and would work to implement if Iran demonstrated the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  But Iran had to understand there were costs to not following this path.  Wang agreed that both sides should try very hard to resolve the problem.   HUNTSMAN
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 000560  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2034 TAGS: PREL PARM ENRG PTER MNUC IR CHSUBJECT: PRC/IRAN: CHINA SEEKS CLARITY ON U.S. IRAN POLICY, OFFERS HELP IN TALKING TO IRAN  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson. Reasons 1.4 (b/d).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  China is keen to understand the direction of U.S. policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) and is willing to facilitate dialogue between the two sides, according to an MFA official.  China remains committed to the P5-plus-1 process but values its bilateral engagement with Iran.  Nonetheless, the Iran should not take for granted its economic relations with the PRC.  Despite PRC urging that Iran respond positively to American overtures, initial rounds of direct talks with the Iranians on the nuclear issue would be difficult, the official suggested.  The official said that it is too soon to contemplate what actions should be taken should Iran develop a nuclear weapon.  An academic contact suggested that there is no "point of no return" on Iran's development of nuclear technology and that the Iranians believe they are in a strong bargaining position should some form of new diplomatic engagement emerge.  END SUMMARY.  2. (C) PolOff discussed Iran-China relations and the international community's efforts to deal with the Iran nuclear issue with Deputy Director Xu Wei of MFA's West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division March 3.  PolOff also met with Li Guofu, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the MFA-affiliated China Institute for International Studies (CIIS) February 27.  China Seeks Clarity on Policy Review ------------------------------------  3. (C) MFA's Xu Wei told PolOff that China was closely following the ongoing review of our Iran policy.  He said that China believed that the United States maintains a leadership role in the Middle East and that the results of the review will have an impact on Chinese engagement with the region.  He said that Beijing hoped for more clarity from the United States on policy adjustments resulting from this review, adding that China had been left to guess at how U.S. policy might change on a very important set of shared concerns.  In the meantime, Xu stressed, China's overall policy toward Iran had not changed, and China would continue to emphasize the importance of stability in the Middle East and its opposition to the development of nuclear weapons in the region.  Xu noted that additional clarity was especially important because China perceives several voices in the USG with different viewpoints on Iran speaking publicly on the issue.  PRC Committed to P5-plus-1, Willing to Facilitate Talks --------------------------------------------- ----------  4. (C) Xu stressed the need to resolve the nuclear impasse through dialogue, and added that China remained committed to the P5-plus-1 process, as indicated in its support for the recent P5-plus-1 joint statement on Iran.  He said that China sincerely hoped that the outcome of our Iran policy review would be direct U.S.-Iran talks, and offered China's assistance in creating a channel for communication with the Iranians.  Official: PRC Effective at Communicating with Tehran --------------------------------------------- -------  5. (C) China and Iran continued to enjoy "good" relations in both the political and economic realms, Xu said, but this did not indicate that China supports all of Tehran's policies. He said that China had developed strong communication with the Iranian regime and used these channels to express to the Iranian leadership the concerns of the P5-plus-1 and the Gulf Cooperation Council over nuclear proliferation.  Beijing sought to persuade Iran to play a positive role in the region, and Chinese communication with Tehran to that end was effective, Xu said, adding that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and the P5-plus-1, though limited, was due in part to Chinese intervention.  China had made clear to Iran that PRC-Iran economic cooperation should not be interpreted as an indication that China is not serious about concerns over nuclear proliferation or about working with the international community to deal with the nuclear issue.  Talking to Iran Would Require Patience --------------------------------------  6. (C) Xu said that the U.S. policy review had generated debate within Iran over how to respond, especially over the possibility of direct dialogue.  China was urging the Iranian regime to respond positively to American overtures, but Xu said that based on his experience working on Iranian issues, he believed the leadership will find it difficult to show a  BEIJING 00000560  002 OF 003   positive attitude in public.  Xu counseled patience, saying that he was concerned that expectations in the United States on how Iran would respond may be too high.  Still, he said that the issues involved were too important for the United States to fail to press forward with dialogue even if any such discussions are difficult.  "Too Soon" to Contemplate Weaponization Concerns --------------------------------------------- ---  7. (C) Pressed on how China would respond if Iran developed nuclear weapons, Xu said that China took proliferation concerns seriously and opposed such a development.  However, he indicated that China did not yet see Iranian development of nuclear weapons as an immediate concern, noting that China was willing to "wait and see how far Iran can go" in developing nuclear technology before it would change its position.  He added that it was still too soon to contemplate what actions should be taken should the Iranians develop a nuclear weapon.  8. (C) CIIS's Li Guofu echoed this approach, saying that while China followed the Iranian nuclear program closely, China was not 100-percent convinced that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons.  He indicated that observers who believe there is a "point of no return" in Iran's technical development of nuclear weapons were incorrect, because the problem was fundamentally a political one and not technical. He said that Iran was moving ahead with its nuclear program without a clear internal position on whether it would want to weaponize the technology, but added that Iran hoped to bring the technology to the point where it could produce a nuclear weapon in a short period of time.  He stressed, however, that in his view, a complicated series of steps remained between the current level of technology and the point of weaponization, including the necessity for a nuclear test. Such a test, he indicated, would have a profound effect on the political questions facing the international community.  U.S. Needs to Offer "Something Real" ------------------------------------  9. (C) Li said that direct U.S. engagement with Iran would be complicated by the reality that there is little the United States can offer at present that would persuade Tehran to change its behavior.  As the regime's confidence in its own domestic legitimacy has grown, the value to the regime of normalized relations with the United States has decreased. Similarly, security guarantees would mean little to an Iranian Government convinced that it can already ensure its own security.  Li stressed that the U.S. side would need to be prepared to make concessions in any engagement, and would need to offer "something real."  Li sugested starting with demonstrating a position of "mutual respect."  Iran Remains Suspicious of U.S. Intentions ------------------------------------------  10. (C) Based on his conversations with Iranian policy-makers, Li said, Iran remained suspicious of U.S. intentions.  He suggested that dialogue with Iran should have a "symbolic" beginning to avoid a false start.  He said that the two sides should first agree on principles not directly related to the nuclear issue.  He suggested that if the Iranians show a willingness to suspend uranium enrichment, the United States should be prepared to follow up immediately with new cooperation.  He stressed that the Iranian leadership regarded itself an important player on the regional issues that concern the United States, especially efforts to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan.  IRI Official: Nuclear Weapon Would Be "Disastrous" --------------------------------------------- -----  11. (C) Li reported that he was told by a Deputy Foreign Minister in Tehran that Iran considers itself a regional power, but understands that if Iran were to develop a nuclear weapon, the United States would likely deploy nuclear weapons to the Persian Gulf region, which would be "strategically disastrous" for Iran.  He said that the official had told him Iran wants to develop "nuclear capability" as a symbol of its status as a regional power.  The official told Li that Iran was nevertheless willing to open a dialogue with the United States.  Other Challenges to Opening a Dialogue --------------------------------------  12. (C) Li said that the atmosphere had improved for developing new engagement with Iran, but obstacles remained.  BEIJING 00000560  003 OF 003   The regime in Tehran continued to see opportunities for changing Iran's engagement with the world under the new U.S. administration, and there was debate in Iran on how best to respond.  Serious debate among the Iranian people on the need for a nuclear program had yet to take place, Li stressed, although the notion of weaponizing the results of the nuclear program continued to generate debate among the Iranian leadership.  Li stressed that the Iranian leadership continued to dismiss the notion of U.S. military action in response to its ongoing nuclear development and was convinced that suspension of uranium enrichment is not necessary for starting a "new process" with the United States.  Election Politics also a Factor -------------------------------  13. (C) Li said that this year's presidential election in Iran would be an important factor in the chances for meaningful talks with the United States.  Noting that the candidacy of former President Khatami posed the first real challenge of the campaign to incumbent President Ahmadinejad, Li stressed that Khatami would not have been able to announce his candidacy without explicit approval from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.  Unlike previous elections, other reformist candidates had since dropped out of the campaign, Li said, improving Khatami's chances.  Still, the hard-liners had acted to overcome their internal divisions in light of the Khatami candidacy, and Ahmadinejad remained "likely" to be re-elected.  Li argued that the top-level blessing of the Khatami candidacy indicated that the Supreme Leader deems Khatami reliable enough and would not expect bold reforms even if Khatami were elected.  In the meantime, Li suggested, Ahmadinejad might feel the need to demonstrate his hard-line credentials in the run-up to the June election.  PRC to Iran: Don't Take Economic Cooperation for Granted --------------------------------------------- -----------  14. (C) Li said that China continued to value development of its economic ties with Iran in order to maintain economic growth.  He noted that Chinese officials told their Iranian counterparts that they are frustrated with the lack of progress on the nuclear issue, progress which would create a foundation for new investment in the energy sector. According to Li, to prod the Iranians to show progress on the nuclear issue, the Chinese had warned them not to take China's economic interests in Iran for granted.  Furthermore, China's dependence on Iranian energy is decreasing given recent improvements in Sino-Saudi relations (as evidenced by President Hu's recent travel there) and their potential to bring about increased Chinese access to Saudi energy supplies.

Sison for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  SUMMARY --------  1. (C) Caretaker Prime Minister Fouad Siniora told visiting Commander General of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) General David Petraeus and the Ambassador June 30 that he was "quite satisfied" with the outcome of Lebanon's June 7 parliamentary elections.  Siniora said that the Lebanese had voted for the state and its institutions and confirmed that Lebanon could practice its democracy without outside interference -- if given the opportunity.  He also thanked the United States for sustained military assistance.  General Petraeus congratulated Lebanon on the peaceful conduct of the elections and expressed hope that a cabinet would be formed soon.  Siniora continued that Lebanon was encouraged by and supportive of President Obama's efforts to reach a comprehensive Middle East Peace, but cautioned that Palestinian resettlement should not come at the expense of Lebanon.    Siniora encouraged the U.S. to push Syria to respect the sovereignty of other states (namely Lebanon) as a way to bring Syria back into the Arab fold, rather than continuing to align itself with Iran.  General Petraeus hoped that the obvious cracks in the Iranian system (illustrated by the demonstrations that followed the Iranian elections) would distract Iran from malign ambitions in the region.  He also briefed Siniora on U.S. military assistance in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  End summary.  2. (SBU) Meeting General Petraeus at his downtown Beirut residence, Siniora was accompanied by his senior advisor Rola Noureddine.  General Petraeus and the Ambassador were accompanied by Colonel Bjarne (Michael) Iverson, Executive Officer; Colonel Mike Bell, Director - Commander's Initiatives Group; Sadi Othman, Cultural Advisor and Translator; Ali Khedery, Advisor; Lieutenant Colonel Dave Wilson, Lebanon Desk Officer, Embassy Defense Attache Lieutenant Colonel James Lantz, Office of Defense Cooperation Chief Colonel Joshua Berisford and an Embassy notetaker.  LEBANON: A "MODEL" FOR THE REGION -----------------  3. (C) Caretaker Prime Minister Fouad Siniora welcomed the one-day visit of the Commanding General of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) General David Petraeus to Beirut on June 30.  Siniora expressed his thanks for sustained U.S. military assistance to Lebanon and asserted that U.S. security assistance had contributed to the positive outcome of the June 7 Lebanese parliamentary elections.  Siniora said he was "quite satisfied" that the majority March 14 coalition had shown that its majority was decisive and not "fictitious," as it had been described by others after the previous elections in 2005.  He described the electoral outcome as  vote for the state and its institutions.  Siniora said that although Lebanon was not the most important country in the world and despite minor irregularities in the conduct of the elections, Lebanon had shown that it could be a model of diversity and democracy -- without outside interference -- in the region.  4. (C) General Petraeus congratulated Siniora on winning his own electoral campaign and the Lebanese people for conducting peaceful elections.  In addition, he expressed hope that the new cabinet would be formed soon.  Siniora predicted the government formation would likely "take some time" because of debate about "blocking third" veto power for the opposition.  MIDDLE EAST PEACE: NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF LEBANON ------------------  5. (C) Siniora said that Lebanon was encouraged by and  supportive of President Obama's commitment to achieving a comprehensive Middle East Peace.  He said the U.S. administration's recognition of the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was an opportunity to push the Arab Peace Initiative forward and to finally achieve a resolution.  The Israelis, however, were being uncooperative, he accused.  In his June 14 speech, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had said "yes" to a two-state solution with but added "a thousand no's," Siniora analyzed.  The ultimate fate of Palestinian refugees, could not come at the expense of Lebanon, Siniora cautioned. (Note: Lebanon has 12 Palestinian rfugee camps.  The GOL maintains that the Palestinins should have the "right of return" and is agaist permanent resettlement ("tawteen") in Lebanon.  End note.)  SYRIA -----  6. (C) Syria, Siniora said, has geopolitical significance. He said Lebanon desired a mutually respectful relationship with Syria and lauded the establishment of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria as a good first step. However, other issues, such as border delineation and the presence of PFLP-GC military camps, supported by Syria, on the border, remain.  Siniora commented on the signs of increased U.S. engagement with Syria, but he advised the United States to be careful not to give any rewards to Syria without Syria taking action first.  Most importantly, the U.S. should not allow Syria -- or other states in the region -- to use Lebanon as a platform or battleground; engagement with Syria should not come at the expense of Lebanon, Siniora said.  7. (C) General Petraeus assured Siniora that the U.S. administration understood Lebanon's concerns.  He told Siniora that Syrian President Bashar Asad had invited him to visit several times, but the time was not yet appropriate. Syria, he added, continues to allow Al Qaeda-affiliated facilitation networks to operate from its territory and allow the transit of suicide bombers into Iraq.  General Petraeus added that the U.S. would like to see Syria return to the Arab world and develop closer ties to the western world, rather than continue to align itself with Iran.  IRAN ----  8. (C) On Iran, General Petraeus said that the crisis following Iran's June 12 presidential election had revealed significant cracks in the Iranian system.  He said the announced outcome of the election and subsequent demonstrations showed that the "urban street" and the "young street" were not supportive of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.  Candidly, the U.S. would like these events to distract Iran for awhile from its other ambitions, such as pursuing its nuclear program, General Petraeus said. Although, it was too early to determine whether the current crisis had any significant impact on Iran's ability to support Hamas, Hizballah, or limit its ability to train and support foreign fighters in Iraq, he added.  Siniora agreed that there were definite cracks in the Iranian system and the internal divisions should be exploited.  However, Siniora warned against Israel taking any military action against Iran saying such action would only make the regional situation worse.  9. (C) General Petraeus responded that it was not the U.S. desire to see outside force used against Iran.  Nonetheless, he observed, there was a phenomenon in the Gulf states where leaders were worried someone would strike Iran's nuclear weapons program, while also worrying that someone would not. Iran, he continued, had become CENTCOM's best recruiting tool, and the number of partnerships and U.S. military assistance agreements with Arab partners in the Gulf had increased significantly.    PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN ------------  10. (C) Turning to other international developments, Siniora said he had heard a rumor that Pakistan was ready to sell some of its nuclear stock to other countries.  General Petraeus responded that this was almost certainly a rumor, but he refused to discount the possibility that Gulf states may "start shopping" if Iran acquired a nuclear weapon capability.  He added that during his recent visit to Pakistan, it was clear that for the first time the Pakistani military viewed the Taliban and other extremist groups as an existential threat to Pakistan.  The Pakistani people, General Petraeus continued, were hugely supportive of its military's efforts to fight against this extremist threat. There were some early signs of some success from Pakistani operations.  11. (C) In Afghanistan, the U.S. was increasing its troop levels by 38,000 from the beginning of 2009 and doubling the number of its helicopters, General Petraeus said.  The war in Afghanistan would be tough, and not easily won.  One key will be the ability of the Afghan government to "step up" to provide governance and be seen to serve the people in areas that have been cleared by Coalition and Afghan forces.. Afghanistan's presidential election was scheduled for August 20, General Petraeus added.  It was likely, but not guaranteed that current Afghan President Hamid Karzai would win, he predicted.  12. (U) CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus has cleared this message. SISON
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BERLIN 001106SIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2019TAGS: GM PREL PGOVSUBJECT: CHANCELLOR ANGELA "TEFLON" MERKEL TAKES LIMELIGHTAS FDP WAITS IN THE WINGSClassified By: MINISTER COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GEORGE GLASS FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)SUMMARY -------1. (C) Less than two weeks after her party suffered lossesin two state elections, CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel foundher fighting spirit before 8,000 party faithful at aSeptember 6 election rally in Duesseldorf launching the "hotphase" of the CDU/CSU electoral campaign. The CDU has beenshifting party tactics after its losses in the August 30elections in Saarland and Thuringia, where the SocialDemocratic Party (SPD) may now be in a position to formcoalitions with the Left Party. Merkel -- to great applause-- focused in on the specter of a so-called red-redgovernment composed of the SPD and The Left Party. Shedescribed the SPD as suffering from an "identity crisis," andneeding a vacation from political decision-making and time inopposition. Along with the entire CDU leadership andincumbent CDU/CSU Ministers-president, Merkel made her casefor a CDU/CSU coalition with the pro-business but sociallyliberal FDP. She repeated the CDU/CSU's election mantra: "wehave the strength" throughout her speech, aiming to convincethe German electorate that a strong CDU/CSU is required forGermany to emerge from its worst economic recession inpost-war history. CDU views on whether the issue ofGermany's role in Afghanistan would become a more prominentcampaign theme were mixed.2. (C) With three weeks to go before the parliamentaryelections, all signs point to Chancellor Merkel returning tooffice, although she and her party recognize that they face adifficult campaign. It remains uncertain whether the CDU andthe FDP will gain enough support to form a majoritycoalition. If not, another Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU-SPD) isvery likely; other options require a three-partyconstellation that would force the ill-suited Greens and FDPto work together. But, there seems to be an almost onehundred percent certainty -- given the SPD's chronic slump inthe polls and limited coalition options -- that SPD ForeignMinister and Chancellor-candidate Frank Walter Steinmeierwill not become Chancellor. End summary.MERKEL CASTS ASIDE SPD, EMBRACES FDP ------------------------------------3. (C) Chancellor Merkel -- to rapturous cries of "Angie,Angie" and a standing ovation -- took to the floor at herparty's September 6 rally before some 8,000 supportersaffirming that the CDU/CSU "have the best chance to win theparliamentary elections" but also cautioning that "theelection's outcome has not yet been decided." On the onehand, she praised her Grand Coalition government's record,noting its success in countering Germany's economic andfinancial crisis. On the other hand, she called for a newCDU/CSU coalition with the FDP after the upcoming elections--casting aside the SPD. She asserted that such a coalitionwould anchor Germany in the "middle" of the politicalspectrum and take the country out of its current economiccrisis faster. Merkel said: "Our country needs a governmentthat will support growth, security and work for everyone."In a swipe at the SPD (COMMENT: Merkel never mentionedSteinmeier by name. END COMMENT.), she said the party iscurrently plagued by an "identity crisis," adding that, "TheSPD is devoid of any reality and is distraught." She asked,"How can a party that achieved 10, 18, and 24 percent at therecent state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saarland betaken seriously?" Dismissing SPD warnings against aso-called "black-yellow" (CDU/CSU-FDP) coalition, Merkel saidthat the country should be more worried about the SPD's plansto form coalitions with The Left Party on the state andfederal levels. (Note: The SPD has warned that ablack-yellow coalition would represent wealthy Germany andbusiness interest at the expense of the middle and lowerclasses.)4. (U) CDU leaders also tried to cast the CDU at the statelevel in a positive light after its poor showing in theSaarland and Thuringia state elections on August, causing theMinister President of the latter state to resign. LowerSaxony's CDU Minister President Christian Wulff asserted thatthe most prosperous and successful "Laender" (states) inGermany are those ruled by the CDU/CSU and FDP. He citedBerlin, governed by SPD Mayor Klaus Wowereit's Berlin (NOTE:in Berlin the SPD rules with The Left Party. END NOTE), asbeing the worst case. Hesse's Minister President Roland Koch-- to great applause -- noted that he could not understandhow the SPD could possibly cooperate on a state or nationallevel with a Left Party that is "anti-American andanti-European." (Note: In Saarland and Thuringia the optionBERLIN 00001106 002 OF 003 exists for the SPD to form a governing coalition with theLeft Party. END NOTE.)CSU Truce with FDP?-------------------5. (C) CSU Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer threwhis party's support behind a CDU/CSU coalition with the FDP,despite his well-publicized doubts about the FDP's realcoalition intentions after the parliamentary elections. Evenas Seehofer pronounced his support for the FDP inDuesseldorf, however, media reports from Munich confirmedthat the CSU had decided to continue attacking the FDP. TheCSU has been buffing its economic bona fides by attacking theFDP on its own themes while basking in the reflected gloryfrom popular Economics Minister zu Guttenberg, the new CSUchampion. Seehofer has publicly suspected that FDP ChairmanGuido Westerwelle -- in an attempt to enter government at allcosts -- might support a "traffic light" coalition with theSPD and the Greens, although this political constellationappears unlikely at present. In addition, Bavarian politicstrump national politics, especially during a time when theCSU longs for the days when their party alone wieldedpolitical power in Munich, rather than as it does today, in acoalition with the FDP. Seehofer is also aware that the CSUneeds to be strong and the FDP proportionally more weak forthe CSU to win more and better ministerial posts in aCDU/CSU-FDP coalition. He did not use his appearance inDuesseldorf to chide the FDP, to the great delight of thosepleading that recent CDU/CSU-FDP bickering had been harmfuland counter-productive during the campaign.AFGHANISTAN - A DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN ISSUE? ----------------------------------------6. (C) The September 4 air strike against two fuel tankersnear Kunduz, Afghanistan hit the press right before theCDU/CSU rally. In light of the German media's frenzy, PolOffasked the CDU's Head of International Relations KlemensMoemkes whether Germany's ISAF commitment might emerge as apotential domestic campaign issue. Moemkes noted that theSPD could make Afghanistan an issue but this would be veryodd given Foreign Minister Steinmeier's support for Germany'smilitary role in ISAF. However, the prospect of Afghanistanbecoming a major theme clearly had the CDU's xxxxxspooked. He told PolOff that it would be very difficult forthe Chancellor not to address Germany's role in Afghanistanin the coming weeks. Given the German public's overwhelmingsupport for a withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan,this was not an issue the Chancellor wanted to address in therun-up to the parliamentary elections.COMMENT -------7. (C) While it is all but certain that Chancellor Merkelwill return to office as Chancellor after the nextparliamentary elections on September 27, it is too close tocall whether she will achieve a coalition with the FDP.Bavarian MP Seehofer's attacks on the FDP in Bavaria couldweaken that party there and further undermine the chances ofa coalition. The FDP wants the same but political bickeringover future ministerial positions and CSU attacks on the FDPin Bavaria and on FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle suggest thata possible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will not be a marriage madein heaven. Some FDP contacts admit that they harbor doubtsabout the Chancellor's promise to form a coalition with theFDP. They insinuate that in reality she may prefer anotherGrand Coalition with the SPD, although Chancellor Merkel hasused every public opportunity to advertise for a CDU/CSU-FDPcoalition. Backing down on this pledge would call intoquestion her reputation.8. (C) Paradoxically, however, it is the CDU/CSU's relativeweakness in the polls (35-36 percent) that threatens apossible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. The FDP is clearly riding ona high with double-digit successes in the state elections ofSaarland, Saxony, and Thuringia, but this may not be enough.The CDU refuses to engage in any self-introspection after itsdefeats in Saarland and Thuringia and the party can reallyonly take comfort from the SPD's perennial weakness. Thefear in the CDU is acute that the Chancellor's highpopularity ratings may not be enough to ensure a comfortablewin for the CDU/CSU at the parliamentary elections.9. (C) Merkel, once again, vehemently denies any intentionto form a Grand Coalition with the SPD but the electoral mathon September 27 may force her -- despite intense CDU/CSUreservations, not to mention those of the German public -- tolook at the SPD as a partner. As for the SPD, Steinmeier isBERLIN 00001106 003 OF 003 looking desperate. The SPD has failed to reach over 25percent in the last six elections and Steinmeier's unlikelypath to the chancellorship is only possible if he reneges ona campaign promise not to form a coalition with The LeftParty. This will not happen in 2009 but the CDU/CSU will nottire of raising the fear of a red-red coalition in 2009 or in2013. The Chancellor appears to be in a win-win situationbut three weeks on the campaign trail can be an eternity.End comment.Murphy
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BERLIN 001162  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/14/2019 TAGS: PGOV PREL GMSUBJECT: GERMANY'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER?: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO FDP CHAIRMAN GUIDO WESTERWELLE  REF: BERLIN 594  Classified By: MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GEORGE GLASS FO R REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D)  SUMMARY -------  1.  (C//NF) Free Democratic Party (FDP) Chairman Guido Westerwelle may be on the verge of becoming Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor in a Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU)-FDP government after the parliamentary elections on September 27.  He has a strong craving for political power and recognition after spending eleven years in opposition.  Westerwelle previewed his foreign and security policy objectives and views in a major speech at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) on May 4, a speech for which the media nicknamed him "Guido Genscher," playing on Westerwelle's ideological leanings and close relationship with former FDP Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.  2.  (C//NF) Westerwelle's DGAP remarks provided us with a glimpse of Westerwellian thought.  They were short on substance, suggesting that Westerwelle's command of complex foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening if he is to successfully represent German interests on the world stage (see REFTEL).  While he is a Transatlanticist, Westerwelle questions the breadth of U.S. power and U.S. calls for stronger German engagement.  He also harbors resentment that he has not been taken more seriously by the Washington political establishment.  (NOTE: Embassy will report SEPTEL on more detailed foreign policy implications for the U.S. of a Westerwelle-led MFA).  END SUMMARY.  WESTERWELLE'S FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES ---------------------------------------  3.  (C) Westerwelle's most important foreign policy priorities will be focused on global disarmament and arms control.  In remarks in Schwerin on September 17, Westerwelle called again for the removal of all U.S. tactical nuclear weapons -- within the context of negotiations with NATO -- from German soil.  He was very critical of the Bush Administration's Missile Defense plans but was quick to praise President Obama's recent announcement on Missile Defense, saying "this move created additional international confidence."  Westerwelle remains a committed Transatlanticist but he has been consistently cautious of committing German troops to out-of-area deployments. Afghanistan was the exception.  Westerwelle continues to support Germany's ISAF mandate, but he has also indicated that the FDP wants to bring German troops home from Afghanistan as soon as possible provided the mission has been successfully completed.  Westerwelle and the FDP support close engagement with Russia and see it as a "strategic partner.  Westerwelle has pursued close ties with Russia's leadership during his eleven years in opposition.  On Iran, Westerwelle has talked about the need for dialogue but his party's pro-business orientation makes him particularly skeptical of sanctions and resistant to unilateral efforts to cut back trade.  THE UNLIKELY FOREIGN MINISTER -----------------------------  4.  (C//NF) By his own admission, Westerwelle has never seriously harbored a fascination for international affairs. FDP Bundestag member Marina Schuster told PolOff recently that foreign policy is not Westerwelle's "true love," but that he will take this position due to its high profile and as it is tied to the position of Vice-Chancellor.  FDP contacts tell us that he plans to remain a foreign policy generalist, which suggests he will have plenty of time to wax lyrical on domestic politics - to the potential detriment of political harmony in a possible future CDU/CSU-FDP coalition.  He also finds very appealing the prospect of being one of the only cabinet members besides the chancellor who can choose his media advisors, which suggests that Westerwelle will continue to place great emphasis on cultivating his public image.  5.  (C//NF) There is a contrast between Westerwelle's increased public support and successful leadership of the FDP versus the continued skepticism, often bordering on contempt, shown by much of the German foreign policy elite toward him. Opinion polls show that Westerwelle's public image has improved substantially in the last year in particular. But, as one well known foreign policy analyst in Berlin told PolOff, he lacks the gravitas and is seen as too  BERLIN 00001162  002 OF 004   opportunistic to be trusted as foreign minister.  At the conclusion of his DGAP speech, several MFA desk officers remarked to PolOff that they were not yet persuaded that Westerwelle had the "foreign and security policy expertise necessary" to become a successful Foreign Minister, although they had no doubts about his ability to get up to speed quickly.  There was a consensus among desk officers -- driven, perhaps, by political bias -- that Westerwelle was arrogant and too fixated on maintaining his "cult of personality."  Negative reaction to his DGAP speech reflects the foreign policy community's skepticism of Westerwelle.  HE'S NO GENSCHER ----------------  6.  (C//NF) Like Dan Quayle in 1992, Westerwelle wants to compare himself to his mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, but in the eyes of the foreign policy community, he is no Genscher. Nevertheless, Westerwelle's world-views have to a large extent been shaped by "Genscherism."  British academic Timothy Garton Ash described "Genscherism" as an attempt "to maintain and improve Germany's ties with a wide range of states, which were themselves pursuing quite different and quite contrary objectives.  This complex balancing act involved saying somewhat different things in different places."  Genscherism also embraced a foreign policy "culture of restraint," while emphasizing the models of "cooperation" and "continuity" in German foreign policy, which Westerwelle discussed in his May 4 speech at the DGAP.  Genscher's "culture of restraint" had a profound influence on Westerwelle's thinking, thus making him very skeptical about committing Germany's armed forces to overseas military operations  (NOTE: Afghanistan was an exception, although with the caveat that Germany's area of responsibility there would remain limited to the north and would concentrate on police training and civil reconstruction efforts (SEPTEL). END NOTE).  A TRANSATLANTICIST WITH A TWIST -------------------------------  7.  (C//NF) At the June 30 meeting, Westerwelle quickly confirmed his Transatlanticist credentials.  Westerwelle's views on the United States' role in the world, however, also defines his brand of Transatlanticism.  According to Westerwelle's political biographer Majid Sattar, Westerwelle has never been able to shake his skepticism about how the United States wields power in the world.  Citing an exchange with former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Burt (1985-1989), Sattar recalls how Westerwelle forcefully intervened in a discussion the Ambassador was having on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War to say: "But you are not the police of the world."  Sattar comments further that Westerwelle was immune to any "transatlantic brainwashing." Although Westerwelle used his DGAP speech to criticize the United States under the Bush Administration for its excessive focus on the War on Terror and unilateralism, saying that the United States had lost its compass more than once, Westerwelle quickly changed his tune when he talked about the positive impact that President Obama has had on U.S. foreign policy since his election.  8.  (C//NF) Westerwelle also made clear that he believes Germany needs to be more engaged in U.S. policy-making.  He criticized Chancellor Merkel for not having been more engaged with Washington on issues of mutual interest, especially arms control, when Washington has been engaged in extensive policy reviews.  He suggested that the FDP would quickly fill the vacuum should they enter government.  WESTERWELLE TO WASHINGTON: WHAT ABOUT ME? -----------------------------------------  9.  (C//NF) Westerwelle has found it hard to conceal his resentment toward Washington based on his feeling that neither its top leadership nor the Embassy in Berlin had courted him during his time in opposition.  At a June 30 meeting between the former CDA and Westerwelle, he criticized the Bush Administration for its failure to seek a political dialogue with him.  Also revealing was Westerwelle's slight edge on his sense of humor, first charming us by inquiring about Secretary Clinton's health after her elbow injury and next joking that he would ask the Secretary if the Embassy had conveyed his best wishes.  10.  (C//NF) Partially due to his insistence on only high-level meetings in Washington (and therefore limited contact), Westerwelle remains a relatively unknown political figure in the U.S., although he has traveled there many times.  Unlike his future potential cabinet colleague,  BERLIN 00001162  003 OF 004   Christian Social Union (CSU) Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Westerwelle has little professional experience in the United States since he never made extensive efforts to introduce himself to the Washington policy community. Unfortunately, our attempts to reach out to Westerwelle were often rebuffed with the excuse that he would only meet the Ambassador.  Only after extensive Embassy negotiations with Westerwelle's staff were former CDA and PolOff able to secure the June 30 meeting.  COMMENT -------  11.  (C//NF) One week before the parliamentary elections, polls indicate that Westerwelle stands a good chance of becoming Germany's next foreign minister, a position he has been preparing for since 2002.  If Westerwelle becomes Foreign Minister, we can expect tough love diplomacy from someone who prides himself in being our "close" friend, but who in reality remains skeptical about the U.S. and its foreign policy objectives.  Westerwelle will be a friend, but he will not hesitate to criticize us if vital German interests are at stake or being challenged.  Westerwelle's prickliness toward the United States would likely be neutralized by the long-sought attention from Washington he would receive if he becomes foreign minister.  Germany's foreign policy elite will continue to view him with skepticism.  The factor that assuages some of this concern, however, is that no one expects him to be able to match Chancellor Merkel if he does become Foreign Minister, and policy experts tell us that foreign policy influence is likely to shift even further to the Chancellery.  END COMMENT.  BIO NOTES ---------  12.  (U) Dr. Guido Westerwelle was born on December 27, 1961 in Bad Honnef (near Bonn) to Dr. Heinrich and Erika Westerwelle.  Family members note that Westerwelle inherited the unbridled, aggressive temperament of his father and the calculated, deliberate, and hesitant cleverness of his mother.  His parents divorced when he was 8 years old, which according to Westerwelle himself, left a scar on his educational and physical development.  After the divorce, Westerwelle was raised by his father -- a lawyer -- and he maintained a close relationship with his mother, also a career lawyer, who lived nearby.  Stefan and Henrik, Guido's half brothers, one from each of his parents' previous relationships, were older and soon left the house to live on their own.  Westerwelle grew up with his younger brother Kai; they were very similar and both were considered active extroverts who enjoyed debates.  Westerwelle enjoys horses and to this day he is an avid equestrian.  13.  (SBU) Westerwelle is openly gay.  He has said that this was not a problem at home since he was raised to be self-confident and his family was very liberal.  In addition, Bonn, where Westerwelle went to university was a liberal town.  Westerwelle officially came out rather quietly in the political world in 2005 at Merkel's 50th birthday party when he brought his partner, Michael Mronz, a sports manager, to the party.  Mronz is currently a steering board member of the 2009 Berlin World Track and Field World Championships. Ironically, Westerwelle is conservative on gay rights.  He is keen to protect the special status of marriages and families under German law.  He opposes adoption by same sex couples but says that he wishes he could have children.  14.  (U) Westerwelle developed an early taste for politics, being the editor of his high school newspaper.  He caused a school controversy when he named teachers who he felt did not respect students who had transferred into the secondary high school system from the grammar school system.  As a result of his story, many teachers developed a dislike for Westerwelle.  He further developed his political thinking when he attended an event with Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Graf Lambsdorff during the 1980 parliamentary elections.  It was at that time that he decided to join the FDP and form an FDP youth group in Bonn.  Westerwelle eventually became a lawyer but his younger brother Kai once said he had the impression that being a lawyer was never his brother's real goal.  His understanding of the media and their use for his own political purposes is envied by many politicians.  He takes a pro-active approach to overseeing his party's media operations.  In front of the camera, Westerwelle comes across as serious, sharp, and calculating, and almost comical at times with what is perceived as a very exaggerated presence. In person, people say Westerwelle is very gallant, funny, and sarcastic.   BERLIN 00001162  004 OF 004   15.  (U)  In his free time, Westerwelle enjoys attending concerts and reading.  He enjoys running, beach volleyball, sailing, horseback riding, and mountain biking.  He collects paintings from New Leipzig School artists such as Neo Rauch and Tim Eitel and is a fond collector of works by Norbert Bisky and Joerg Immendorff.  He enjoys vacationing in Italy and Spain. Murphy

BERLIN 988      B. 2008 BERLIN 504      C. 2008 BERLIN 354  Classified By: Global Affairs Unit Chief Don Brown for Reasons 1.4(b) a nd (d).  1. (C) Summary: Current polling data suggest that the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) could receive sufficient votes in the September 27 national elections to form a governing coalition.  The FDP are strong defenders of citizens' privacy rights and these views have led the FDP to oppose all of Germany's recent counterterrorism legislative proposals, as well as voice concerns about U.S.-German and U.S.-EU information sharing initiatives.  Throughout these debates, the FDP has favored data protection measures over the need for governments to strengthen security-related information sharing for counterterrorism purposes.  The FDP's strong views on individual liberties and personal privacy could lead to complications concerning law enforcement security cooperation and data sharing.  Were the FDP to join the government, we expect they would closely scrutinize any proposals for security officials to access and/or share information concerning private persons with international partners, including the USG.  End Summary.   THE FDP AND DATA PRIVACY ------------------------   2. (C) The FDP defines itself as a independent pro-business party, advocating low taxes, open trade, and minimal government intervention in business and private life.  The party promotes European liberalism, championing freedom and individual responsibility under a government "as extensive as necessary, and as limited as possible."  The FDP's limited government viewpoint shapes their views on counterterrorism policy.  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks and in reaction to a number of terrorist plots uncovered in Germany, successive German governments have passed a series of legislative packages that have strengthened Germany's counterterrorism legal frameworks and broadened the investigative powers of law enforcement agencies.  The FDP, which was not a member of these post-9/11 governing coalitions, regularly criticized these amendments for infringing on citizens' personal privacy rights.  The FDP's criticisms of security-related data sharing agreements have also extended to the U.S.-Germany bilateral "Pruem-like" agreement to share personal information on serious crime and terrorism suspects (ref C), the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Recognition (PNR) initiative, and elements of the Visa Waiver Program that involve sharing information on travelers.   FDP Objections to Counterterrorism Laws ---------------------------------------  3. (C) FDP parliamentarians and party leaders were strong critics of the CDU/CSU - SPD government's introduction of two new counterterrorism legislative proposals, the BKA Law and the Terror Camp Law.  Passed in 2008 and enacted at the beginning of 2009, the BKA Law increased the investigative powers of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA).  The most controversial aspect of the BKA Law was that it permitted security officials to use a variety of technical surveillance measures in terrorism investigations (Ref B). Specifically, the law provides the BKA with the power to conduct remote, on-line investigations of the computers of terrorism and serious crime suspects.  The FDP strongly opposed these measures as an unnecessary invasion of privacy, despite the limitation of on-line searches to only life-threatening situations (or threats to the constitutional order of the German state).  These cases would require a judge's advance approval and are expected to number just a dozen cases per year.  Nevertheless, FDP parliamentarian Max Stadler called the measures "constitutionally questionable," and in a meeting with EMIN, Stadler feared that authorities would carry out surveillance without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing.  FDP parliamentarian Gisela Piltz warned that the law would turn the BKA into a "super spy agency resembling the FBI."  Former FDP Federal Interior Minister, Gerhart Baum, blasted the law, saying it violated privacy rights, freedom of the press, and the inviolability of private residences.   4. (C) Earlier this summer, the government passed legislation developed by the Justice Ministry that criminalized a range of terrorism-related preparatory actions such as distributing information on bomb-making and participating in para-military training overseas (ref A).  The law was developed in response to the September 2007 arrests in Germany of three homegrown terrorists who had attended an Islamic Jihad Union terrorism training camp in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Justice Ministry officials and prosecutors have told EconOffs that the new law has closed gaps in Germany's legal framework that had previously prevented German prosecutors from charging German citizens and residents with activities that directly or indirectly supported terrorist groups.  Prior to the passage of the law, the FDP criticized the draft as unnecessary, claiming that existing legislation was sufficient to arrest and prosecute potential terrorists in Germany.  The FDP also criticized that law for allegedly requiring prosecutors to be able to prove that individuals who participate in training at overseas terrorist camps actually intend to carry out attacks; that the law would thereby permit the punishment for thoughts, rather than for actions.  Justice Ministry officials have indicated to EconOffs that these criticisms are unfounded hyperbole and that prosecutors will be able to build strong cases against those who undergo training at foreign terrorist training sites.   FDP Objects to U.S.-German Data Sharing Agreement --------------------------------------------- ----   5. (C) Immediately following the March 2008 completion of the U.S.-German data sharing agreement to enhance cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crime (aka, the Pruem-like agreement, Ref C), FDP parliamentarians began to express concerns regarding the agreement.  FDP members took particular aim at an article in the agreement that calls for additional data protection measures to be taken if special categories of personal data (such as ethnic origin, political opinion, religion, trade union membership, and sexual orientation) are transferred among law enforcement agencies.  (Comment: In our discussions with FDP parliamentarians, we explained that negotiators did not foresee that such information would need to be transferred regularly and that the article was inserted as a means of providing extra data privacy protections in the rare occurrence that such information was pertinent to an investigation.  End Comment.)  In meetings with EMIN, Stadler and Piltz also expressed objections to the data retention periods of the agreement, questioned which USG law enforcement agencies would have access to the information, and voiced a general concern about potential misuse of the personal information (names, DOBs, addresses, passport numbers, etc.) that would be shared by the agreement.  Piltz further claimed that the U.S. government as a whole lacked effective data protection measures in comparison to Germany and questioned why the USG does not have a overall federal data protection commissioner as Germany does.  (Comment: Piltz' remark underscores the importance of ensuring German officials receive information about USG data protection policy.  The April visit to Berlin by DHS Chief Privacy Officer Callahan was useful in this regard, but more needs to be done to ensure German officials understand U.S. data protection policy.  End Comment.)  6. (C) FDP leaders have also taken aim at U.S.-EU agreements that include data sharing elements.  Following the July EU GAERC decision to give the Swedish EU Presidency a mandate to begin negotiating a successor agreement governing USG access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) database of financial transactions, FDP head Guido Westerwelle called the plan "totally unacceptable" and said that the "plan must be stopped."  Parliamentarian Piltz, who is a member of the Bundestag Interior Committee, has criticized the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) data transfer agreement for collecting "pointless" information on travelers and she doubts whether the information collected under PNR would be of any value to law enforcement officials.  In meetings with EconOffs, Piltz broadly spoke of governments, particularly that of the U.S., accumulating large amounts of data on their (mostly) innocent citizens.  Piltz expressed concerns that German commercial interests could be damaged when U.S. authorities obtained PNR data on German business travelers that might somehow be shared with American competitors.   Would the FDP be a reliable security partner? ---------------------------------------------  7. (C) The FDP's voting record on counterterrorism legislation and the views of leading FDP security policy figures described here suggest that cooperation on security matters, particularly those involving information sharing, with a future German government that includes the FDP could be problematic.  At times, the FDP's fixation on data privacy and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of the party forming responsible views on security policy.  The FDP has been out of power for over 10 years and lack experience tackling security issues in the Internet age.  The FDP appears not to fully grasp the transnational character of terrorism today and terrorists' increasing use of the Internet and related technology to recruit, train and organize.  Current Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) has repeatedly drawn attention to terrorist use of the Internet, which he calls the "main medium of holy war against the West - it is the communication platform, advertising medium, distance university, training camp, think tank and recruiting instrument for terrorists."  Schaeuble understands that combating terrorism in a globalized world requires international cooperation and for security officials to use modern technology.  No FDP leader has displayed a similar understanding of the need to find a proper balance between personal freedoms and security measures; the FDP has all too often found it politically expedient to cast these goals as mutually exclusive.  8. (C) At election campaign rallies last week FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle criticized the on-line surveillance measures contained in the BKA law and championed the FDP as the sole party committed to data privacy and protection issues.  FDP parliamentarian Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has been suggested as a possible Justice Minister in a CDU/CSU - FDP government, a job she previously held under Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU).  Given that she resigned as Justice Minister in 1996 after failing to obtain support for her rejection of a CDU proposal to expand the state's right to monitor private citizens, we would expect her to closely scrutinize all bilateral and U.S.-EU information sharing proposals.  In particular, a FDP-led Justice Ministry could well complicate implementation of the bilateral Pruem-like agreement, prevent negotiations on a HSPD-6 terrorist screening data sharing arrangement, and raise objections to U.S.-EU information sharing initiatives.  9. (C) An MFA official working in the counterterrorism office noted that one reason the FDP has been so vocal in opposing Germany's counterterrorism legislative drafts, bilateral and U.S.-EU security initiatives is due to the fact that they are in the opposition.  Pure political considerations dictate that the role of the opposition is to oppose the governing coalition's proposals.  Following this line of reasoning, were the FDP to join the CDU/CSU in a governing coalition, the responsibilities of power would perhaps convince them to take a more constructive approach to counterterrorism and security issues.  Furthermore, given that the FDP would be the junior partner in the coalition, we hope that CDU/CSU leadership would ensure that German legal frameworks are adequate and that law enforcement and security officials continue our current close cooperation and robust information sharing on operational matters.

BERLIN 1162  Classified By: MINISTER COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GEORGE GLASS FO R REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D)  SUMMARY -------  1. (C/NF) This is not a "change" election.  The German public does not see the September 27 parliamentary elections as decisive, and on many foreign policy fronts, including Afghanistan, arms control, and Russia, we do not foresee significant or distinct policy differences between the two most feasible coalition options.  The most likely results of the elections are a CDU/CSU-FDP (black-yellow) coalition or a continued CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition.  However, in some areas there may be changes, including on Iran, tax policy, and nuclear energy.  More importantly, there may be a new foreign minister who will likely need to get up to speed quickly on such crucial issues as Iran, Afghanistan, and NATO's strategic posture.  Leaders from the CDU/CSU and FDP promise a government more friendly toward the United States. The near certainty that Angela Merkel will remain chancellor argues for this, but the unpredictability of Foreign Minister-aspirant and FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle may call for focused diplomatic engagement with the new FDP political actors (see REFTEL E for Post's comprehensive expose of Westerwelle).  END SUMMARY.  BLACK-YELLOW (CDU/CSU-FDP)? ---------------------------  2.  (C/NF) It is virtually certain that Angela Merkel will retain her position as Chancellor after this Sunday's elections.  But it is impossible to predict the final composition of the next coalition given that about a third of the electorate is still undecided and the polls show only a narrow parliamentary majority for black-yellow.  Chancellor Merkel has repeatedly voiced her preference for a black-yellow coalition and has promised to form one even with a one-vote parliamentary majority.  The FDP's Westerwelle has echoed this sentiment as its first choice as well.  3.  (C/NF) The SPD has almost no prospect of leading a government and is only likely to remain in power as a weakened junior partner in another Grand Coalition, should the CDU/CSU-FDP come up short of a parliamentary majority. The SPD has failed to gain much momentum, although it has more recently risen a couple of points in the polls.  It continues to suffer from an inability to profile itself against the CDU (or even a lack of desire to break with the CDU in any significant way), with which it has been in government for the past four years.  Also unhelpful have been a string of losses in local, state, and the June European Parliament elections.  4.  (C/NF) U.S. interests will not only be affected by the composition of the next coalition but also which parties are in the opposition.  A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition would bring to power a new set of top players at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Environment, and at either Economics or Finance (as well as probably at least one other FDP-led ministry with some turnover in CDU/CSU ministries as well). The extent to which policy will change is less obvious, however, because FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister aspirant Guido Westerwelle has promised considerable continuity with Steinmeier's approach to foreign policy.  In addition, the FDP's economic reform goals will face considerable resistance from the Bavarian CSU as well as parts of the CDU.  The lack of coordination and consistency, including between the Chancellery and MFA, that often occurs in German policy making will continue to be a challenge for the United States.   5.  (C/NF) A black-yellow coalition will face a more united opposition led by an SPD that is likely to move left if it leaves government and seeks to profile itself against the Greens and the Left Party, based on the profiles of SPD leaders waiting in the wings for Steinmeier and SPD Chairman  BERLIN 00001176  002 OF 006   Franz Muentefering to leave.  German governments can operate with narrow majorities due to strict party discipline (which gets stricter the narrower the majority), but Merkel has not shown much courage in using her considerable personal popularity to push through policies that lack public support.  On Afghanistan, in particular, a black-yellow coalition may seek to simply roll over the ISAF mandate unchanged when it comes up for renewal in December, rather than risk a row in the Bundestag over an increase in the troop ceiling, which the Defense Ministry has concluded is necessary to deal with the growing insurgency in the German north.  OR GRAND COALITION (CDU/CSU-SPD)? ---------------------------------  6.  (C/NF) However, another Grand Coalition cannot be discounted, even though nobody professes to want it.  It is a historical fact that the center-right parties have not won a parliamentary majority since 1994.  Another Grand Coalition would almost certainly be even more difficult for the CDU/CSU and the SPD than the current one since both parties would be eyeing each other with distrust and the expectation that the government may not last an entire term.  Further, Merkel's position within her party would be weakened by what would be viewed as her failure to achieve a coalition with the FDP while the Free Democrats would continue to take advantage of conservative dissatisfaction with the Grand Coalition's disgruntled CDU voters.  7.  (C/NF) The SPD leadership might be secretly relieved not to lose their government posts, but its continued partnership with the CDU/CSU would likely cause further bleeding of the party's more leftist supporters to the Greens and Left Party, further weakening its base.  In addition, the SPD left-right split might be exacerbated, with leftists tempted to prematurely rupture the Grand Coalition to build a majority red-red-green government where the SPD would hold the chancellorship.  CDU officials certainly believe -- and have told the Embassy -- that they expect the SPD would seek to replace a Grand Coalition with a red-red-green one some time during the term.  Even though Steinmeier has insisted that any coalition agreement would be for the entire legislative period, the distrust between the parties would remain.  Plus, if the SPD performs badly in the election, Steinmeier literally may no longer be in a position to keep his word.  GERMANY'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER - WESTERWELLE OR STEINMEIER? --------------------------------------------- ---------------  8.  (C/NF) The election's most obvious impact on bilateral relations will be in terms of a potential change in foreign ministers.  Our extensive experience with Steinmeier allows us to comfortably predict how a Steinmeier-led MFA would pursue German interests globally, and vis-a-vis the United States.  On the other hand, Westerwelle continues to remain an enigma who has been unable to establish himself as a significant voice on foreign affairs.  The FDP's foreign policy spokesman Werner Hoyer -- a well known foreign policy analyst in Germany and internationally, including in the United States -- has taken the lead here.  When we asked Hoyer this week what would change with Westerwelle, he struggled to say anything.  Westerwelle is a domestic political animal with little appetite for foreign policy and international affairs.  He will, therefore, continue to be dependent for foreign policy advice on his mentor, former Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as well as on Hoyer and whichever Ministry diplomats gain his trust (REFTEL E).  9.  (C/NF) Westerwelle's attempt to position himself among Germany's foreign policy elite with a speech in May at the German Foreign Relations Council (DGAP) did not produce the intended results and instead revealed his limitations on such major issues as Middle East peace.  If Westerwelle becomes Germany's next foreign minister, his learning curve will be steep.  Germany's small foreign and security policy elite -- already skeptical of Westerwelle -- will resent his rise into the second most powerful political office of the land.  And we will be faced with the question of how best to approach someone who has clearly had a mixed relationship with the United States.  Despite Westerwelle's praise and respect for the current Obama Administration, we should not forget that, as part of the opposition, he has criticized the United States for the last eight years, while at the same time  BERLIN 00001176  003 OF 006   offering very few ideas of his own on how to solve international problems (see REFTEL E).  10.  (C/NF) If Steinmeier is able to lead the SPD to a strong enough showing to force a Grand Coalition, he certainly could maintain his position as Foreign Minister.  He would also have the increased political clout provided by a mandate in the Bundestag and his success in blocking a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition.  Obviously, there would be a high degree of foreign policy continuity.  Unlike Westerwelle, Steinmeier is already on board with both sides of the U.S. approach to Iran, and he has told the Ambassador that he supports additional sanctions should Tehran fail to respond to U.S. overtures.  However, competition between Steinmeier and Merkel over control of foreign policy will not end with the election, and Steinmeier would likely try to focus on a few key issues where he could differentiate himself and his party from Merkel and the CDU, with arms control, Afghanistan, and Russian relations being likely choices.  Steinmeier wants to work closely with Washington on these issues and is less likely to surprise Washington than the Chancellery would be.  11.  (C/NF) The goodwill that marked the first year of the Grand Coalition is unlikely to be repeated in a second term, particularly as Steinmeier contends with those in his own party who would prefer a leftist coalition.  If there is not enough support for a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition, then there would likely be a numerical red-red-green majority in the Bundestag.  The strained communication that currently marks Chancellery-MFA relations is likely to continue.  Both Steinmeier and Merkel are responsible realists, however, who understand the need to work together on the big issues, as was evident during the Russian invasion of Georgia, their approach to the Middle East, and their reaction to the international financial melt down.  If new crises arise, the two are likely to continue to put their own interests aside long enough to speak with a single voice.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IN BLACK-YELLOW AND GRAND COALITIONS --------------------------------------------- -------------  12.  (C/NF) AFGHANISTAN (Some Change): Westerwelle is one of the few German politicians who justifies the Afghanistan deployment on the basis of "German national security interests" and the FDP as a whole has been a consistent supporter of the ISAF mandate.  But with only a narrow majority in the Bundestag and facing an SPD opposition ready to accuse them of militarizing the German mission, a CDU-CSU/FDP coalition ironically might be less willing (and able) to push through necessary troop increases than a Grand Coalition.  On the other hand, there is likely to be no difference between the two on the support for police training, economic assistance and other civilian aid.  13.  (SBU) ARMS CONTROL/NONPROLIFERATION (Little change): Westerwelle proudly says that the motto of the MFA under his leadership will be "peace through disarmament," thereby seeking to be even more pro-arms control than Steinmeier. Although Westerwelle has called for the removal of all U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from German soil by 2013, it is questionable whether he will manage to include this in a coalition agreement with the CDU/CSU given their likely resistance.  14. (C/NF) RUSSIA (No change): Like the SPD, the FDP sees Russia as a "strategic partner" in addressing issues such as Iran, energy, and Afghanistan and believes engagement and assistance with modernization is the best way to address Russia's democratic deficits.  Like Merkel and Steinmeier, Westerwelle has pursued close ties to Russian leaders, including Foreign Minister Lavrov and Defense Minister Ivanov, both of whom gave him high-profile meetings in Moscow this past spring.  15. (C/NF) IRAN (Some change): Steinmeier has been a steady supporter of US policy toward Iran -- both in terms of dialogue and the need for increased sanctions if necessary, while Westerwelle has spoken almost exclusively about the need for dialogue.  In addition, Westerwelle's FDP's pro-business orientation makes it particularly skeptical of sanctions and is also resistant to unilateral efforts to cut back trade.  Merkel will likely have to take a stronger role in this issue to keep Germany's position from falling back to  BERLIN 00001176  004 OF 006   the least common denominator.  16.  (C/NF) TURKEY (Some change): A black-yellow coalition may result in a subtle, less favorable, shift in Germany's policy towards Turkey with the exit of the SPD -- Turkey's staunchest supporter -- from the government.  Although FDP foreign policy experts recognize that EU membership is an important factor in encouraging additional domestic reforms in Turkey, it has kept an open mind on the issue.  However, the FDP is more vocal than the SPD in its criticism of Turkey.  17.  (C/NF) MIDDLE EAST (Little change): Westerwelle's views on Israel and Middle East peace may stem more from his past experience in addressing criticism against Israel and his interpretation of Germany's historical role toward Israel than from his own Middle East policy or strategic calculations.  Some attribute Westerwelle's current pro-Israel stance as the result of his having been burned politically both domestically and in Israel in 2002.  At that time, Westerwelle defended an FDP politician, Juergen Moellemann, who had published a brochure strongly critical of then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's actions towards the Palestinians.  Some claimed the brochure was anti-Semitic.  While in Israel shortly thereafter, Westerwelle was questioned by then-PM Sharon about what Sharon referred to as a growing anti-Semitism in Germany and Europe.  In an August 2009 interview with "Der Spiegel," Westerwelle explained his decision to vote against Germany's participation in UNIFIL with his view that Germany cannot take a neutral position in the Middle East because of its past.  He noted that he had visited the Golan Heights in Israel as a young man and was impressed with the vulnerability of the country.  Even more so than Steinmeier, however, Westerwelle may seek a greater role for Germany and the EU in the Middle East.  In the "Spiegel" interview, he called for the EU to launch an initiative to establish a conference for security and cooperation in the Middle East. We could expect both Steinmeier and Westerwelle to hold to U.S. messages on the Middle East, with both competing with the Chancellery for the lead on this issue.  18. (C/NF) GUANTANAMO (No change): Steinmeier would likely take a more accommodating approach toward Germany accepting some of the Guantanamo detainees than would Westerwelle, but the key ministry in deciding this issue will continue to be Interior.  In either a black-yellow or another Grand Coalition, Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) could continue on as Interior Minister, although there is some talk of his being named as EU commissioner.  Schaeuble has been very skeptical of accepting detainees from a security standpoint.  More recently, he told the Ambassador that Germany would only take detainees who will require no surveillance.  19. (SBU) ECONOMIC CRISIS/INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATION (Little Change): All potential government parties share a similar strategy; increase regulation and supervision of the financial sector with differences at the margin.  The SPD advocates taxing share trades over 1000 euros and monitoring private equity funds more closely, while the CDU/CSU and FDP propose concentrating financial supervision under the Bundesbank.  A black-yellow government would result in a new Finance Minister; if Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg remains at the Economics Ministry, then the FDP might be given the Finance Minister, with Hans-Otto Solms, an experienced and cautious financial policy expert, the most likely replacement.  20. (C) CLIMATE CHANGE (No Change): There is little difference between the parties on issues in play at the upcoming UNFCCC's COP-15 in Copenhagen, and Merkel maintains strong control over German policy in this area.  There will be a new Environment Minister should a black-yellow government be formed, however, and it is unclear which party would then control the Ministry.  In previous CDU/CSU-FDP coalitions, the CDU ran it but if the FDP does as well as current polls suggest, it might make a play for the Ministry.  Current SPD Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel has had a high profile in his party's Bundestag campaign and could remain in place in a Grand Coalition.  21. (C) ENERGY (Some Change): The SPD insisted on continuation of the previous government's plan to phase out nuclear power plants during the last coalition negotiations  BERLIN 00001176  005 OF 006   and would stick to this position again.  In contrast, the FDP has been the party most open to nuclear energy, insisting that the phase-out itself should be at least slowed down to protect Germany's supply of energy.  The CSU/CSU also wants to extend the possible life of existing nuclear power plants, provided they are safe, during a "transitional" period to provide time for Germany to switch to greater reliance on renewable sources.  Recent controversies over the safety of some nuclear power plants have made Merkel and even the FDP less willing to press for reliance on nuclear energy.  22. (C/NF) DATA PROTECTION (Little Change): Data privacy has been a second-tier campaign issue but does arise in debates on domestic security policy.  Another Grand Coalition could leave Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries (SPD) in place; she reluctantly agreed to the landmark data sharing initiative on serious crime and terrorism suspects (the Pruem-like agreement) due to privacy concerns.  A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition might return Sabine Leutheusser-Scharrenberger to the Justice Ministry, which she headed from 1992-96 in the last black-yellow coalition (she resigned her office after the her party agreed to wiretapping legislation proposed by the CDU/CSU).  She or any FDP Justice Minister would likely continue to see their role as the protector of civil liberties and therefore they would carefully scrutinize all bilateral and U.S.-EU data sharing initiatives.  23. (C/NF) COUNTER-TERRORISM/LAW ENFORCEMENT (Little change): The CDU will likely remain in control of the Interior Ministry regardless of the coalition, and Schaeuble, although 67, is likely but not certain to stay on for another term. He has brought U.S.-German CT cooperation to an unprecedented level, and no other German official has offered as much cooperation (except on the issue of resettling Guantanamo detainees where the focus on internal German security supersedes his desire to work with Washington).  Any possible replacement -- Chancellery Chief Thomas de Maiziere has been mentioned in the press -- is unlikely to have his authority or expertise but will likely continue his policies.  24. (U) TRADE (No change): All five parties are committed to open market but the SPD, Greens, and The Left Party want environmental and social standards included while the CDU/CSU stresses the need for protection of intellectual property and the FDP worries about domestic subsidies and market access. None of the parties wants to restructure the German economy to reduce export-dependency and address global imbalances. Other U.S. interests, such as concluding the Doha round of trade negotiations, would not likely be affected by a change in coalition.  25. (U) TAX POLICY (Some change): Tax policy is often cited as the area where a black-yellow government would produce change.  The FDP proposes a radical overhaul of the tax system to simplify the tax code and stagger the corporate rate.  CSU leader and Bavaria Minister-President Horst Seehofer has been critical of the FDP plan, which he says will run up the deficit and impose an excessive burden on the public budget.  Neither the CDU/CSU's nor FDP's tax proposals are realistic, however, in light of budget deficits that are expected to be more than 2 percent this year and 4 percent in 2010, just as mid-term targets for Germany's balanced budget amendment kick in.  Some sort of tax increase therefore is a near certainty, perhaps in the form of an increase in the value-added tax.  COMMENT -------  26. (C/NF) Chancellor Merkel will continue to exert strong influence on German foreign policy in an attempt to create a political legacy in international affairs.  This will be true whether the MFA is led by Steinmeier or Westerwelle.  We can also predict that tensions between the Chancellery and MFA will remain based on different coalition partners controlling them.  If Steinmeier returns to office, he will be a reliable partner.  Westerwelle is a wild card; his exuberant personality does not lend itself to taking a back seat to Chancellor Merkel on any issue.  If he becomes foreign minister, there is the possibility of higher profile discord between the Chancellery and MFA.  This may demand focused diplomatic engagement by the USG with the new FDP political actors.  END COMMENT.  BERLIN 00001176  006 OF 006   Murphy

MURPHY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D)  SUMMARY -------  1.  (C) Chancellor Merkel achieved her goal of a solid parliamentary majority for her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), but will have to contend with a self-confident FDP that is likely to seek major concessions in terms of policy and personnel.  Nonetheless, the CDU/CSU's 33.8 percent showing was its lowest since 1949, while the FDP's 14.6 percent was its strongest in the history of the Federal Republic.  The SPD crashed, while the Left Party and Greens were able to score their highest results ever, with the Left Party surpassing the Greens overall and overtaking the SPD in the eastern German states by a wide margin.  Merkel hopes that coalition negotiations with the FDP will be "quick and decisive," while FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle -- widely expected to be the next foreign minister -- has emphasized his intention to press for the party's goals of a fundamental tax reform, more emphasis on education, and stronger protection of civil liberties.   Merkel and Westerwelle already met privately election night (September 27) and coalition negotiations should begin soon, most likely with the goal of having a formal agreement with the selection of a cabinet by the time the Bundestag convenes a month from now. End Summary.  OVERALL TREND: MAJOR PARTIES IN DECLINE ---------------------------------------  2.  (U) The results show the decline of the major parties -- particularly the SPD -- and the strengthening of a five-party system.  Preliminary results give CDU/CSU 33.8 percent (versus 35.2 percent in 2005); the FDP 14.6 percent (9.8); the SPD 23.0 (34.3); the Left Party 11.9 (8.7), and the Greens 10.7 (8.1).  The decline in the CDU/CSU percentage is due particularly to the CSU's losses in Bavaria, where the party suffered its worst Bundestag result ever at 42.6 percent, down from 49.2 percent in 2005, but it still won all 45 of its constituencies.  These preliminary results give the CDU 24 "surplus mandates" because of the high number of constituency seats it won despite its low 33.8 percent second vote showing (see REFTEL G).  3.  (U) The new coalition should end up with control of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat (Upper Council).  Based on the preliminary official results, the CDU/CSU will have 239 seats in the Bundestag (up from 226), which along with the 93 FDP Bundestag seats (previously 61) would give the new government a solid majority.  The SPD will have 146 seats in the Bundestag (down from 222), the Left Party 76 (versus 54) and the Greens 68 (versus 51).  The Schleswig Holstein election on September 27 also appears to have given the CDU and FDP a parliamentary majority in that state.  With CDU-FDP governments there and in Saxony, where the two parties won a majority on August 30, the new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will soon have a majority in the Bundesrat and should be able to gain its approval of future coalition legislation.  4.  (C) Chancellor Merkel and her CDU/CSU Union are somewhat disappointed by their party's results, but are publicly emphasizing that the CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition has met its demise and will be replaced by a center-right coalition composed of the CDU/CSU and FDP.  "We achieved something fantastic," said Chancellor Merkel, now facing a second four-year term.  "We achieved a stable majority in Germany for a new government...We can party tonight, but there is a lot of work waiting for us."  An uncharacteristically emotional Merkel -- clearly relieved by her victory -- promised to be the "Chancellor of all Germans" -- old and young, entrepreneurs and workers -- and said the CDU/CSU would be sufficiently dominant in the new coalition to prevail "in questions that affect social balance."  5.  (C) Despite her huge personal popularity, however, Merkel led her CDU/CSU Union to its second poorest result in history, leaving her vulnerable to future backstabbing within  BERLIN 00001197  002 OF 003   her party.  Merkel -- while happy to be rid of the Grand Coalition with the SPD -- now faces the challenging task of entering a coalition with a party that could prove to be more difficult to manage than the SPD.  Merkel will start talks with the FDP within days.  It could, however, take up to the end of October for the parties to forge the policy compromises and work out the distribution of cabinet posts necessary to seal a coalition deal.  FDP: THE REAL WINNER --------------------  6.  (C) The FDP will return to government after eleven years in opposition, having achieved its best election results in the party's history.  Its leader, FDP Party Chairman Guido Westerwelle, will most likely become Germany's next foreign minister (see REFTEL E).  At the FDP election celebration, Westerwelle told his party faithful that "We want to be part of the government.  But this means responsibility, and we are ready to take on this responsibility." Westerwelle said his party would work to ensure that Germany gets a "fair tax system and better educational opportunities" and that civil rights would once again be respected. The FDP will be in a very powerful position to demand a larger number of cabinet seats in a new German government. They are likely to expect to get at least the equivalent of what they have had in the past:  the foreign office, either justice or perhaps interior (which they led from 1969-82), economics or possibly finance, and at least one other ministry (in the past they have had education and economic cooperation (i.e. development). However, the FDP will find it difficult to negotiate a coalition agreement with the CDU/CSU over the coming weeks, especially in the areas of tax cuts (see REFTEL F) and civil rights, including data privacy (see REFTEL D).  SPD: HARD ROAD AHEAD --------------------  7.  (C) It would be hard to exaggerate the dimension of the SPD defeat.  The party fell more than 11 points to its worst result in the post-war period.  Its share of the eastern German vote was 19 percent, behind both the CDU and Left Party, and the FDP came within striking distance of the SPD in some western German states, including Bavaria, where the SPD's 17 percent was just ahead of the FDP's 15 percent.  The SPD election-night party was like a funeral, and Steinmeier and SPD party chairman Muentefering appeared grim-faced to announce that Steinmeier would be the Bundestag caucus chairman and thus unofficial leader of the opposition to the new black-yellow government.  Muentefering did not, as many expected, announce his resignation but it is likely to come by the time of the next party conference in mid-November.  8.  (C) Exit polls show that the SPD lost more than a million votes to former supporters who simply stayed home and additional voters to the Left Party and Greens, and that the public still blames it for the changes in unemployment insurance and the retirement age enacted during the Schroeder government and as part of the grand coalition.  The SPD, with only four minister-presidents and a shrunken parliamentary caucus, will have to decide how to profile itself against its two fellow leftist opposition parties, and the party left is likely to press for coalitions with the Left and Greens at the state level.  LEFT OVERTAKES GREENS ---------------------  9.  (C) The Left Party -- under Oskar Lafontaine's and Gregor Gysi's leadership -- can also claim electoral victory with their party's best showing ever in a parliamentary election. Having won 11.9 per cent of the total vote and 20 direct mandates -- the largest number ever for one of the smaller parties -- it will be difficult for Germany's other parties, especially the SPD, to ignore The Left's steady rise in popularity in east and west Germany (see REFTEL B).  The party successfully stole the SPD's thunder and was partially responsible for the SPD's poorest showing ever in German election history.  The Left Party can now concentrate on achieving the ultimate prize in German politics in 2013: a governing coalition with the SPD and the Greens.  Berlin SPD Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit has already said that this year's election must be the last one in which the SPD excludes the possibility of cooperation with the Left, and he and other left-wingers in the SPD will likely fight to bring the two parties closer together.  GREENS: HOW TO STAY RELEVANT?  BERLIN 00001197  003 OF 003   -----------------------------  10.  (C) The Greens may have celebrated their first double digit showing (10.7 per cent) in a parliamentary election, but the party was unsuccessful in preventing a black-yellow coalition or becoming the third strongest party in the Bundestag (see REFTEL A).  Party Co-Chairman Cem Oezdemir -- who failed to win his direct mandate and was too low on the party list to win a seat in the Bundestag -- said that the Greens would establish themselves as a "think tank for social issues and for Germany as a whole."  The SPD's disastrous electoral result will remind the Greens that they may need to reach out to the CDU if they are to remain a relevant political power.  For the foreseeable future, Oezdemir hinted that his party would concentrate on achieving good results at future state elections and plotting their return to power in 2013.  COMMENT -------  11.  (C) Chancellor Merkel's main campaign objective -- to attract centrist support by out-positioning the SPD as the best protector of Germany's social welfare state -- was successful, although her CDU/CSU union suffered losses, primarily because of the CSU.  She will now have to find a way to balance this promise with FDP demands for greater reforms while dealing with the likely struggles between a strengthened FDP and a CSU that is concerned about its continued decline.  The parties will now enter complex coalition negotiations with pressure to complete them by the time that the new Bundestag convenes in late October, these talks have the potential to be very contentious.  Merkel will want to stamp her authority on the coalition agreement, while Westerwelle will be a tough bargaining partner for Merkel as he aims to extract the maximum amount of policy and personnel concessions from the CDU/CSU.  Finally, as a weakened SPD moves into the opposition, it can be expected that it will seek to continue the public debate on the major campaign issues and begin to rebuild itself, a process that could include its strong re-positioning to the left.  12.  (C)  What does a CDU/CSU-FDP victory mean for the United States?  On a practical level, Germany will have a new foreign minister, most likely Guido Westerwelle, who has enjoyed a difficult relationship with the United States during his time spent in opposition (see REFTEL D). Westerwelle will face a steep learning curve at the MFA, but we should not expect him to play second fiddle to Chancellor Merkel.  The foreign and security policy rivalry between the MFA and Chancellery during the Bush Administration will not disappear.  Indeed, they may be enhanced with Westerwelle's attempt to profile and make an international name for himself as quickly as possible, making it difficult for us to identify who is in the lead on any given issue.  Chancellor Merkel and Westerwelle will be competing for attention; the latter's flamboyant and outgoing style may give him a leg up but Chancellor Merkel will be keen to assert her primacy in international affairs, especially on economic and EU matters.  She has more government and foreign policy experience that will come in handy in this future duel, and in an age of international summitry, the Chancellor rather than the Foreign Minister calls the shots.  We should not underestimate her desire to carve out a political legacy for herself, especially in the international arena, and her record of strong cooperation with Washington suggests that her dominance is likely to have a net benefit for US interests.  13.

BERLIN 1162      B. BERLIN 1241  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor George Glass for reasons 1. 4 (b,d).  1.  (C//NF) Summary: A well-placed FDP source said that on the first day of coalition negotiations (October 5) between the CDU, CSU and the FDP, FDP leader Westerwelle argued for the removal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from German soil.  Interior Minister Schaeuble (CDU) asserted that the weapons serve as a deterrent.  Other foreign policy issues discussed included support for Afghanistan and Turkey's accession to the EU.  Source said that Chancellor Merkel (CDU) may push to complete the negotiations by October 18, but noted that the FDP is in no hurry.  He provided Emboffs with a list of the membership of the negotiations plenary and working groups as well as timetable.  Cabinet composition will only be decided at the end of coalition negotiations.  End summary.  Westerwelle Firm on Removal of Nuclear Weapons --------------------------------------------- -  2.  (C//NF) Formal coalition negotiations between Guido Westerwelle's Free Democratic Party (FDP), Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) on a coalition agreement began on October 5.  FDP strategist shared with Emboffs and visiting Senior Germany Desk Officer October 7 information on issues discussed during the first two days of these negotiations as well as the negotiations schedule and working group make-up. Source serves as his party's notetaker for the negotiations and has been a long-standing close Embassy contact.  3.  (C//NF) Source said that on October 5 negotiations included discussion on arms control in general and removal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from German soil.  He said that Federal Interior Minister Schaeuble argued that the weapons serve as a deterrent to Iran.  (Note: Regarding Schaeuble, source commented that he is "neurotic" in that he sees threats everywhere.  He questioned whether Schaeuble's influence is as great as it once was and whether he will stay in his position.  End note.)  According to source, Westerwelle asserted that nuclear weapons on German soil do not serve as a deterrent against Iran since they could not reach Iran.  He said that Westerwelle underlined that President Obama is moving forward toward a "nuclear-free world" and that he wants Germany to be in the lead.  Source said that Chancellor Merkel quipped in response that Germany is not that important in this regard -- the world would hardly take notice if there were action on this matter. According to source, Merkel wanted to avoid discussion of this topic.  Source also said that there was criticism of Social Democratic Party Foreign Minister Steinmeier that he did not respond adequately to President Obama's Prague speech in which he discussed arms control.  In response to Poloff query, source said that the issue of removal of nuclear weapons is very important to Westerwelle and that he could well seek to include something specific in the coalition agreement.  Turkey's EU Membership; Afghanistan; Transatlantic Relations --------------------------------------------- ---------------  4.  (C//NF) Source said that Turkey's accession to the EU was also discussed, with general agreement that Turkey is not ready for membership and could not fulfill membership criteria.  Source said that there was agreement that no decision would have to be reached on this issue within the next four years in any case.  Westerwelle also spoke against any type of automatic decision in favor of membership for Turkey.  There was also general agreement that the EU is not ready for new members at this time beyond Croatia.  5.  (C//NF) Afghanistan was also an issue, but source only noted that there was general agreement on the need to continue efforts in Afghanistan.  Source also stressed that the three parties support strong transatlantic relations and continuity in foreign policy.  The Devil's in the Details; What's the Rush? --------------------------------------------  6.  (C//NF) Source assessed some differences in Merkel's and Westerwelle's approach to the negotiations, although he also noted that the atmosphere was "very friendly and relaxed." He observed that Merkel preferred less detail and more general provisions, whereas Westerwelle was interested in a  detailed agreement that would guide the coalition over the next four years.  In addition, source noted that Merkel is trying to push the negotiations along since she would like to have the new government in place before she travels to Washington in early November and before the EU summit at the end of October.  Source indicated that Westerwelle might try to use Merkel's desire for speed to his advantage in the negotiations.  While he did not indicate that the FDP would prolong negotiations intentionally, he noted that the FDP was in no hurry to complete them.  Ministries Divided Among Parties Last -------------------------------------  7. (C//NF)  Regarding the possible make-up of the cabinet, source said that no decisions will be made until the end of coalition negotiations and that the current membership of working groups should not be seen as an indication of who will end up in which ministry (see ref B).  Source also said that the coalition agreement may only say which ministerial posts go to which coalition parties, without any names being given.  The names would only be provided later, perhaps after the Chancellor is voted in by the Bundestag.  Source noted that only two positions are certain: Angela Merkel will be Chancellor and Guido Westerwelle will be Vice Chancellor.  He added that Westerwelle will most likely also become the next foreign minister.  He then commented that during October 5 negotiations, Economics Minister zu Guttenberg demonstrated his interest in foreign policy and Hermann Otto Solms (FDP) showed he could play an increasingly important role in the financial area.  Source provided Emboffs with the names of those serving in the plenary rounds of the negotiations and a schedule of when those rounds will take place.  --Plenary Members from the CDU: Chancellor Merkel, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellery Chief Thomas de Maziere, Education Minister Annette Shavan, CDU/CSU Caucus Chief Volker Kauder, CDU General Secretary Ronald Pofalla, Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) Juergen Ruettgers, Minister President of Hesse Roland Koch, Minister President of Lower Saxony Christian Wulff.  --Plenary Members from the CSU: Minister President of Bavaria and CSU Chair Horst Seehofer, Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Head of CSU Bundestag group Peter Ramsauer, CSU Secretary General Alexander Dobrindt, Bavaria State Parliament President Barbara Stamm, Bavaria Plenipotentiary Markus Soeder, Bavaria Finance Minister Georg Fahrenschon, Bavaria Justice Minister Beate Merk.  --Plenary Members from the FDP: Party Chair Guido Westerwelle, FDP Secretary General Dirk Niebel, Bundestag Vice President Hermann Otto Solms, FDP Deputy Caucus Chairperson Birgit Homburger, Lower Saxony Minister for Economics Philipp Roesler, FDP deputy chair Rainer Bruederle, Deputy Minister President for NRW Andreas Pinkwart, Deputy Chairperson Bundestag Education Committee Cornelia Pieper, Bavaria State Chairperson Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.   Comment -------  8.  (C//NF) Westerwelle has made the removal of nuclear weapons from Germany one of his flagship issues in the foreign policy arena and has raised this in various fora in the past.  It is not clear how hard he will push to have a specific provision on this included in the coalition agreement.  Judging by source's description of the discussion, Merkel would rather have a more general provision regarding disarmament included and preferred to avoid prolonged discussion on this issue.  9.  (C//NF) The CDU/CSU is the only party that still supports German participation in the NATO nuclear share and the deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Germany.  While the CDU/CSU leadership is willing to fight for the current policy, it is concerned that the ongoing Nuclear Posture Review could significantly change U.S. policy on the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe, putting it at a significant political disadvantage vis-a-vis the rest of the German political establishment.  In fact, senior Chancellery officials have already requested that they be pre-notified about any possible change in U.S. policy (ref C).  We expect that in these coalition negotiations, the CDU/CSU may hedge their bets against a possible U.S. policy change by agreeing to language that commits the next government to seek consultations on this issue at NATO, with the caveat that any decision must be made by the Alliance as  a whole and must take account of the large number of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons oriented against NATO member states.  Post will seek meetings with source after the plenary negotiation rounds to see if additional readouts are possible.  10.  (C//NF) FDP source is a young, up-and-coming party loyalist, who has offered Emboffs internal party documents in the past.  Excited with his role as FDP negotiations notetaker, he seemed happy to share his observations and insights and read to us directly from his notes.  He also provided copies of documents from his "negotiations" binder. Murphy

(C//NF) Summary: A well-placed Free Democratic Party (FDP) source told Emboffs October 15 that Chancellor Angela Merkel aims to finish coalition negotiations between her Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union, and the FDP by October 18, but that the FDP viewed a completion of October 23 to be more feasible.  Either date would allow the parties to hold conventions to approve the agreement during the following days and enable the Bundestag to elect Angela Merkel Chancellor on October 28, one day after the first scheduled meeting of the new Bundestag.  FDP source said that in any case, the virtually certain future Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle would want to do the Chancellor "the favor" of ensuring her election before her upcoming visit to Washington on November 2.  A worst case scenario -- and least likely -- is that she would be elected by November 8, source said, just prior to the November 9 fall of the Wall anniversary.  Source provided Emboffs with a list of the 15 mostly domestic-oriented points included in the FDP campaign platform that it wants to see included in the coalition agreement, including withdrawal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from German soil, the only one addressing foreign policy (reftel).  End summary.  2.  (C//NF) Source provided Emboffs with a schedule of the next days of the coalition negotiations.  The schedule showed that the various working groups of the negotiations would each report to the plenary (see reftel) October 16-17, with a smaller group of the plenary then meeting on October 17 to iron out disputed issues and beginning discussions on division of the ministerial portfolios between the parties. Chancellor Merkel, source said, hopes to wrap up the coalition negotiations on October 18 after a full-day plenary session, a goal he described as "very ambitious but possible."  Source noted that the FDP was not as optimistic that a conclusion could be reached as of October 18, and scheduled three more plenary sessions for October 21, 22 and 23.  He noted that it is feasible that a coalition agreement could be concluded by that date and that the three parties would then hold conventions to approve the agreement in the days following.  3.  (C//NF) This schedule would enable the Bundestag to then elect Merkel as Chancellor October 28, the day after its first plenary.  Source noted, however, that the FDP has alerted the party of three possible  party convention dates: October 25 -- if things go as plans, November 1 -- if negotiations are prolonged, or November 8 -- worst case scenario.  Source said that it would not be "unattractive" for Westerwelle to attend the EU Summit October 29-30.  This would be a good "debut" for Westerwelle, he added.  In the event negotiations are prolonged, source said that Westerwelle would like to do the Chancellor "the favor" by enabling her to be elected Chancellor before she travels to Washington November 2.  4.  (C//NF) About the actual negotiations, FDP source provided Emboffs with 15 points from their election platform that the FDP would like to see included in the coalition agreement.  The majority of the 15 points focus on domestic economic and social issues, including structural tax reform, amendments to the social welfare and pension systems, and support for education.  The points also include the goal of ending what is termed "unnecessary and ineffective" measures to censor the internet and preventing domestic military deployments.  The final point, and the only one that concerns foreign policy, calls for "entering negotiations with our allies" in order to achieve a withdrawal of nuclear weapons stationed in Germany during the next legislative term. (Note: In response to Emboff questions, source said that the goal really is to develop a plan for the withdrawal of the nuclear weapons.  End note.)  FDP source said that conscription is a disputed issue that is still under discussion.  Regarding Turkey's EU membership, FDP source said that the FDP would rather not include anything on this subject in the agreement, arguing that it will not be at issue during the next four years.  5.  (C//NF) FDP source assessed that about 85 percent of the issues will be decided during this coming weekend.  The FDP intends to keep the remaining 15 percent of the issues open and use them as bargaining tools for decisions on the division of ministerial portfolios.  Regarding portfolios, FDP source commented off the record that current Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had been trying to serve as the  CDU's "grey eminence,"  seeking to exert influence over many of the working groups, beyond his own working group of internal security.  Source said that the FDP viewed his role negatively, and that he was referred to within the FDP as "an angry old man."  He indicated that he hoped the CDU would also view his role as counterproductive.  Source, however, noted that the agreement will only state which ministerial portfolios each party will receive, without providing any names.  He stressed that it is up to each party to then decide who will fill those positions.   Murphy
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 BERLIN 001360  SENSITIVE  DEPT FOR EUR/CE SIPDIS  E.O. 12958:  N/A TAGS: PGOV PINR GMSUBJECT: THE NEW GERMAN CABINET - AN OVERVIEW  Ref: Berlin 1337, Berlin 1340, Berlin 1167  BERLIN 00001360  001.2 OF 004   1. (SBU) Chancellor Merkel's new Cabinet emerged early on October 24 after a month of intense media speculation about its make-up; it contained several surprises.  Perhaps the most unexpected announcements were that of former Interior Minister Schaeuble as Finance Minister and former Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as the new Defense Minister.  The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will run the Chancellery as well as six ministries and have a minister without portfolio, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) will hold five as well as the Vice Chancellorship, and the Christian Social Union (CSU), three.  The ministerial competencies and their names remain unchanged.  Following is a short description of Merkel's new Cabinet, which was formally sworn in on October 28:  Chief of the Chancellery and Minister Without Portfolio: Ronald Pofalla (CDU) --------------------------------------  Pofalla, 50, takes over from Thomas de Maiziere as the Chancellor's chief of staff.  Pofalla is a lawyer and since 2005 served as CDU Secretary General.  He is known as a close confidant of Angela Merkel.  As Secretary General, he had been criticized as lacking a public profile and not being aggressive enough.  From 2004-2005 he served as deputy caucus leader for economics and labor issues in the Bundestag.  Also within the Chancellery, Merkel's security and foreign policy advisor Christoph Heusgen remains, as do Maria Boehmer as Minister of State for Migration, Refugees and Integration and Bernd Neumann, Minister of State for Culture and Media.  Eckart von Klaeden (CDU and a Merkel confidant) becomes State Minister in the Chancellery for coordination with the federal states and parliamentary contacts.  Foreign Affairs: Guido Westerwelle (FDP) ---------------------------------------  Westerwelle, 47, becomes Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor -- as expected.  Economic Assistance will not be included in the Foreign office, but the FDP will also control that ministry.  Minister of State within the MFA will be Werner Hoyer, who already served in that function under Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel from 1994-1998. He also was Westerwelle's foreign policy adviser in the election campaign.  He will cover all divisions apart from "culture" and "economics and sustainable development."  The other Minister of State is Cornelia Pieper, deputy FDP chairperson, who has no experience in this field and will reportedly focus on cultural and communication issues.  Martin Biesel, Westerwelle's Bundestag chief of staff, will become a State Secretary within the MFA to coordinate the work of the FDP ministries with the Chancellery.  Westerwelle has described Biesel as his closest advisor.  Defense: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) ----------------------------------------  The CSU's rising star, zu Guttenberg, 37, seemed certain to remain in the cabinet.  However, there was speculation that his Economics Ministry seat would be up for grabs.  When Economics went to the FDP and Finance to Schaeuble, zu Guttenberg's best fit was in Defense. The DefMin job gives zu Guttenberg the opportunity to work on foreign and security issues again, which was his main area of interest as a parliamentarian.  He is seen as a good and capable replacement for Jung, who was widely criticized for being overly cautious and inarticulate in explaining security and defense issues to the German public.  Zu Guttenberg is expected to improve the Defense Ministry's image, prestige and weight within the cabinet through his popularity and public relations talents.  His appointment has already boosted morale among working level officials in the MOD, who believe that zu Guttenberg will make MOD a real player once again in German security policy debates.  He is a transatlanticist and well known in Washington.  He will likely give the Defense Ministry a higher profile.  He will retain the current Parliamentary State Secretaries Thomas Kossendey (CSU) and Christian Schmidt (CSU).  Interior: Thomas de Maiziere (CDU) ---------------------------------  De Maiziere, 55, a lawyer, is a confidant of Angela Merkel and has served as her chief of staff in the Chancellery for four years.  He had been mentioned as a potential finance minister, but reportedly, his personal preference was interior.  He brings some experience to the job, since he served as state interior minister in Saxony 2004-2005 and as state minister of justice 2002-2004.  However, some of the issues he will face as federal interior minister, namely international terrorism, are topics he has less exposure to.  De Maiziere is known to be a consensus builder who works the interagency process well and is a good problem solver.    BERLIN 00001360  002.2 OF 004   Finance: Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) ---------------------------------  Merkel wanted a political heavy weight in this difficult position during the financial and economic crisis.  Schaeuble, 67, is an experienced, strong and well established politician from Germany's southwest, who is expected to fill his new role quite well.  He has by far the longest federal government experience in Merkel's cabinet.  Confined to a wheel chair since he was shot during a campaign rally in 1990, the conservative politician from the German southwest is not known as a close friend of Chancellor Merkel's.  A member of the Bundestag since 1972, he is pragmatic, copes well with pressure, and is known for his fierce loyalty.  He does not shy away from confrontation and will be ready to pursue unpopular or controversial measures.  In light of his age and his political standing, he does not have to fear any consequences for his future career, which a younger candidate would take into consideration. While he had to give up the Interior Ministry (which he reportedly liked very much), he is being compensated by running one of the most influential ministries in the cabinet.  While he cooperated well during the coalition talks, political observers would have expected major clashes with FDP Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger over domestic security issues if he had remained in the Interior Ministry.  Economics and Technology: Rainer Bruederle (FDP) --------------------------------------------- --  Bruederle, 64, has been deputy caucus chief and economic spokesman of the FDP in the Bundestag.  He already served as economic minster in Rhineland Palatinate 1987-1998, where he strongly promoted wine-growers, trade, and small and midsize business.  Since 1983 he has been state chairman of the FDP in Rhineland Palatinate and member of the national executive committee and since 1995 deputy national party chairman.  Hans-Joachim Otto and Ernst Burgbacher (both FDP) will become State Secretaries within that Ministry.  Labor and Social Affairs: Franz-Josef Jung (CDU) --------------------------------------------- --  Defense Minister Jung, 60, was unexpectedly switched to the Labor and Social Affairs ministry.  Jung had fallen victim to much criticism during his tenure as Defense Minister and Merkel had been pressured to replace him.  Merkel, however, had to find another cabinet post for Jung to maintain a proportional regional representation in the cabinet - Jung's state of Hesse had to be represented.   Another reason for Merkel to keep Jung in the cabinet in spite of his weaknesses and previous failures is his loyalty as a minister.  Justice: Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) --------------------------------------------- --  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, 58, is FDP chairperson and caucus chief in Bavaria.  She successfully ran the 2008 FDP election campaign in that state, where the FDP reentered the state parliament after 14 years of absence.  She was the FDP's chief negotiator on Justice in the coalition talks.  She previously served as Justice Minister under Chancellor Kohl from 1992-1996, but resigned in opposition to legislation allowing electronic eavesdropping of private residences, which was planned by her own government.  She has a strong focus on civil rights and data protection, and has been critical of what she views are overly intrusive wiretapping and other electronic surveillance measures (see ref C).  Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth: Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) --------------------------------------  Von der Leyen, 51, a medical doctor and mother of seven, had indicated a strong interest in moving to the health portfolio and worked out that respective section of the coalition agreement for the CDU.  Merkel reportedly was not interested, however, in the CDU controlling the health ministry in light of the necessary but unpopular reforms and increasing costs of health care for citizens. Since the health ministry went to the FDP, von der Leyen will remain in her current position. In the past few years, von der Leyen has successfully modernized the family policy of the CDU and thus its image in this sector.  She is one of Germany's most popular politicians according to public opinion polls.  Health: Philipp Roesler (FDP) ----------------------------  Roesler, 36, is the youngest member of the cabinet and his nomination was a surprise.  He is sharp and dynamic and a rising star of the FDP.  He was state secretary general, state party chairman and eventually economics minister in Lower-Saxony.  He was born in Vietnam and was adopted by a German family.  Both Roesler  BERLIN 00001360  003.2 OF 004   and his wife are medical doctors, which gives him some practical background for his new portfolio.  Roesler negotiated the health section of the coalition agreement for the FDP.  Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety: Norbert Roettgen (CDU) -------------------------------------  Roettgen, 44, a close confidant of Chancellor Merkel had also been named as potential chief of staff at the Chancellery.  He has worked closely with the Chancellor since her days as caucus chairman 2002-2005.  Merkel reportedly appreciates his loyalty and analytical talents.  During the financial crisis he became one of her closest advisors.  While he does not have a reputation for expertise in his new portfolio, Merkel obviously wanted to position many of her confidants in the new cabinet.  Environmental issues, especially climate change, will figure prominently for Merkel.   Education and Research: Annette Schavan (CDU) ---------------------------------------------  Schavan, 54, will keep her current cabinet position.  Even though she did not have a prominent record, as a confidant of Angela Merkel, it was assumed that she would stay on as a member of the cabinet.  Transportation, Building, and Urban Development:  Peter Ramsauer (CSU) -----------------------------------  Since November 2005, Ramsauer, 55, has served as head of the CSU group in the Bundestag and deputy CDU/CSU caucus chief.  As minister for construction, housing and transportation, he will have a huge budget to work with.  Food, Agriculture, and Consumer Protection: Ilse Aigner (CSU) -------------------------------------------  Aigner, 44, only became Minister for Agriculture and Consumer Protection in October 2008.  She came to this job as an expert on research issues and new to the realities of production agriculture. In her tenure, some parts of the German agriculture community have been critical of her performance, particularly her close relationship to Bavarian Minister President Horst Seehofer. The CSU was interested in keeping this portfolio since agriculture continues to play an important and tactical role in Bavaria.  Economic Cooperation and Development: Dirk Niebel (FDP) --------------------------------------------- -----  Niebel, 46, has been Secretary General of the FDP since May 2005 and belongs to the inner leadership circle of the FDP.  He was named as a potential minister since he made strong contributions to the electoral success of the FDP.  His actual expertise would have been labor and social affairs.  However, that portfolio went to the CDU. The FDP sought in the coalition talks to have the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) merged with the MFA, but failing that, having control of both ministries goes a long way to meeting its concern that BMZ development policy be in line with MFA priorities, especially on key issues like Afghanistan.  Media commentary has focused on Niebel's lack of previous experience in development assistance, and how he may essentially serve as a department head under Foreign Minister Westerwelle.  Comment -------  2.  (SBU) With five ministries in the new cabinet, the FDP is arguably one of the most powerful junior coalition partners in recent German history in terms of both the number and quality of their cabinet appointments.  The Greens had three, mostly junior, ministries in their coalition with the Social Democrats from 1998-2005.  The FDP has one more than it had during its last coalition with the CDU.  This is due in part to the election outcome in which the FDP had its strongest-ever performance, with 14.6 percent of the vote.  CDU officials also describe the appointments as partial compensation for the policy concessions the FDP made during coalition negotiations.  The CDU/CSU will have the popular and competent Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Defense Minister, balancing the FDP's control over Foreign Affairs and Development Assistance.  Zu Guttenberg -- a strong transatlanticist -- is well-connected in Washington and already has a strong background in foreign and security policy.  There has been some criticism that the new Cabinet does not have any representation from eastern states. Merkel responded to the criticism reminding that in fact the Chancellor herself counts as representing the East.  End comment.   BERLIN 00001360  004.2 OF 004   3.

Pollard, Minister-Counselor for Economic Affai rs for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d).  1. (C) SUMMARY: Germany's new federal interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, is known for being a competent administrator who performed effectively over the past four years as the Chancellery Chief of Staff.  De Maiziere is a close confidant of Chancellor Merkel, their professional relationship dates back to 1990, and he developed a reputation as a reliable crisis manager and interagency master over the past four years.  Although de Maiziere previously served as a state interior minister in Saxony, he has less direct experience dealing with the international security issues - most prominently counterterrorism - that he will face as federal interior minister.  Furthermore, de Maiziere is not known for being ideological or outspoken.  In this respect, de Maiziere represents a marked change from his predecessor, powerhouse Wolfgang Schaeuble, who had strong views on security policy and was willing to endure considerable criticism to achieve his policy goals.  We do not expect de Maiziere to push for further expanding law enforcement powers of police and/or security services.  De Maiziere indicates that he intends to focus on integration of foreigners into German society and will continue the Ministry's Islam Conference, a controversial Schaeuble initiative that had advanced the country's discussion on immigration and discrimination issues.  He also intends to promote the further integration of former east and west Germany.  END SUMMARY   An Aristocratic Westerner Makes His Name in the East --------------------------------------------- -------   2. (U) De Maiziere, 55, is a lawyer by training who was born and raised in Bonn, but has spent nearly the last two decades in the eastern states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony. He is a descendent of the noble Maiziere-les-Metz family who, as Huguenots, fled France for asylum in Prussia in the late seventeenth century.  De Maiziere's father, Ulrich, was Inspector General of the German Armed Forces.  His cousin, Lothar, was the last, and only democratically elected, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, who later served as a minister in the Kohl government.  As a staffer in the offices of Berlin Governing Mayor Richard von Weizsacker, and later Eberhard Diepgen, de Maiziere participated in the negotiations on German reunification.  After 1990, de Maiziere worked to re-establish democratic structures in eastern states starting first in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. From 1998 through 2005, de Maiziere served in Saxony as head of the State Chancery, and as Finance, Justice and Interior Minister.  De Maiziere joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as a student in 1972.  De Maiziere won a direct mandate in the September 27 national parliamentary election and is now a member of the Bundestag representing the district of Meissen in Saxony.   3. (C) De Maiziere first met Angela Merkel in 1990 and his recommendation of her to his cousin Lothar de Maiziere is said to have facilitated her entry into CDU politics. Chancellor Merkel and de Maiziere are known to have a very close professional relationship and to share a similar sober and analytical approach to governing.  De Maiziere is reported to have performed well throughout his tenure as Merkel's Chancellery Chief and Minister for Special Duties. As Chancellery Chief of Staff, de Maiziere was known as a consensus builder who understands and effectively works the  interagency process, sometimes requiring competing ministers to resolve disputes among themselves.  The Chancellor no doubt appreciated de Maiziere's efforts to shield her from these policy battles given her general propensity to stay above the fray and to express an opinion on an issue only when consensus has been reached at the cabinet level.   De Maiziere Faces a Steep Learning Curve ----------------------------------------   4. (C) De Maiziere's experience in eastern Germany helped him gain new responsibilities for the Federal Interior Ministry: the entire Department of Eastern German affairs has been moved from the Transportation and Urban Affairs Ministry to the Interior Ministry.  In his remarks to ministry employees on his first day in office, de Maiziere said that with this move the interior ministry is now responsible for not only immigrant integration, but also the integration of Eastern and Western Germany and the cohesion of German society.  De Maiziere will continue the German Islam Conference, an initiative started by his predecessor, which seeks to improve the integration of Germany's Muslim population and open a dialogue between the government and Germany's Muslim community.  The Islam Conference has met with some controversy and came under scrutiny earlier this year when it was discovered that some Muslim representatives were alleged to have links with extremist groups.   5. (S/NF) De Maiziere has some familiarity with security issues given that his duties in the Chancellery included overall coordination of Germany's intelligence services.  De Maiziere was helpful in promoting cooperation between German ministries and security services with USG counterparts both during the 2007 Sauerland Islamic Jihad Union terrorist cell case and following extremist threats surrounding the recent national elections.  De Maiziere's predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble spent considerable time dealing with the issue of terrorism and working to update Germany's legal frameworks and expand the mandates of law enforcement agencies to ensure they had the capabilities to address the phenomena.  In contrast, de Maiziere said virtually nothing in public on the issue of terrorism during his time in the Chancellery, and he has not emphasized the topic since moving to Interior. Therefore, there is some question concerning the depth of his knowledge of the transnational character of terrorism, radicalization pathways, and terrorists' increasing use of the Internet and related technology to recruit, train and organize, aspects of the issue that most affect Germany today.   6. (C) During his first day remarks to employees, de Maiziere made the peculiar statement that "the Interior Ministry is responsible for internal matters, and the Foreign Ministry is responsible for issues external to Germany."  This characterization of the MoI's tasks contrasts sharply with EU law enforcement integration initiatives under Schaeuble such as the Pruem data sharing agreement.  Observers are concerned that de Maiziere's limited perspective could result in diminished bilateral cooperation and mark a significant departure from former minister Schaeuble, who placed a heavy emphasis throughout his tenure on increasing security cooperation with European and other international partners. De Maiziere would benefit from learning about the benefits of international cooperation first hand from his counterparts at the G6 meeting in London this week, which DHS Secretary Napolitano and senior DoJ representatives will attend. (Note: The G6 is an informal grouping of the interior ministers of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Poland and the UK.  Schaeuble made a point of inviting the USG to G6 meetings that he hosted, a custom that UK Minister Jacqui Smith is following for this week's London meeting.  Ref D.)   Will de Maiziere be a Strong Security Partner? --------------------------------------------- -   7. (C) We do not expect de Maiziere to be aggressive in pushing for expanded security powers.  However, there is less need for this as two recent legislative packages have already strengthened Germany's counterterrorism legal framework (Refs C and E).  More relevant is whether de Maiziere will build on Schaeuble's record of deepening U.S.-German security cooperation, such as the successful negotiations of a bilateral "Pruem-like" agreement to exchange information on terrorism and serious crime suspects, as well as establish an automated fingerprint checking system.  Final implementation of our agreement is awaiting resolution of some concerns raised by a Green Party Justice Senator from Hamburg.  We will likely need support from de Maiziere to break this impasse, but it is unclear whether de Maiziere is willing to make the effort on an initiative that his predecessor initiated and for which he received heavy criticism due to data privacy concerns.  On the issue of resettlement of Guantanamo detainees, de Maiziere has yet to express a viewpoint one way or the other.   8. (C) We anticipate that data protection and domestic security issues will be a continuing theme that the new coalition government of the Christian Democrats (CDU and CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP) will struggle with.  During the previous administration, the FDP regularly criticized former interior minister Schaeuble for policies which the FDP believed trampled on citizens' privacy rights (Ref B). Germany's new Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) believes that Schaeuble went too far in giving police new powers of investigation, and she was successful in committing the new government to modify a number of these powers and introducing added data protection measures in the recently completed coalition agreement (Ref A).  The FDP has found it politically expedient to cast personal freedoms and security policy as mutually exclusive.  In this debate, de Maiziere's greatest advantage is that he is not Schaeuble. As Interior Minister, de Maiziere is expected to support existing laws and practices initiated by his predecessor, and his reputation for reasonableness and consensus-building should serve him well in these discussions.

(C) Summary: Just hours after Chancellor Merkel's historic November 3 address to a joint session of Congress, General Motors (GM) canceled its sale of Opel to Canadian auto parts manufacturer Magna.  The decision, which followed repeated assurances from GM that it was a done deal, came as a complete shock in Germany and dominated media coverage throughout the day.  Merkel herself was reportedly highly upset over GM's flip flop.  Ulrich Wilhelm, the Chancellor's spokesman on Opel said the German government "regretted" the decision, and reminded GM that it must now repay Berlin's 1.5 billion bridge loan to Opel by the end of the month, while FDP Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle described GM's action as "totally unacceptable."  The cabinet was expected to discuss the GM move on November 4. Opel's labor unions, which had strongly backed the Magna sale because of its promise to save jobs and keep plants open, announced that workers would withdraw all concessions made under the terms of the Magna deal and sta rt a general strike at Opel plants on November 5.  While anger is widespread, there are already some voices outside the government advocating acceptance of GM's announcement as the only viable alternative to a total collapse of Opel.  End Summary.   Germany's Political Establishment Reacts with Anger --------------------------------------------- ------  2. (C) Opinion across the political spectrum has been uniformly negative.  FDP Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle blasted GM's behavior as "totally unacceptable."  Juergen Ruettgers, Minister President of Nordrhein Westfallen (CDU), asserted that GM's decision showed "the ugly face of turbo capitalism." The leadership of the FDP, whose opposition to government intervention in the Opel deal is well known, joined in the condemnation of GM.  A high-level source indicated that Chancellor Merkel is furious over the GM move and refuses to talk to GM's leadership.  It is likely to be only a matter of time before critics will call Merkel herself into account for her strong support of the now collapsed Magna deal.  The Cabinet has been called into session and is likely to confirm the withdrawal of all financial support and a demand that GM repay the government's 1.5 billion Euro bridge loan by the end of the month.  3. (C) Jochen Homann, the Economic Ministry State Secretary heading the German interagency working group on Opel, told EMIN on November 4 that there was no possibility of further German financial assistance to Opel in the foreseeable future.  The failure of the Magna deal and GM's reputation as "an unreliable partner" would likewise complicate negotiations with other governments seeking to preserve Opel jobs and factories.  Although no one directly blamed the USG, the Germans are still having trouble understanding how GM could act independently of Washington.  Dr. Schubert, one of Homann's lieutenants, complained to the Embassy that "if the U.S. Government had GM under better control, this would not have happened."  It is now up to GM, he said, to submit a new restructuring and financing plan, as their previous one is out of date.  Schubert was adamant that this time "there will be no special treatment for Opel" and GM's plan would have to go through normal channels.   Matched by Threats from Organized Labor ---------------------------------------  4. (SBU) Klaus Franz, the head of Opel's Works Council, announced on November 4 that Opel's 25,000 employees in Germany will begin an indefinite strike on November 5 to protest the GM decision.  Franz called on all 55,000 Opel workers across Europe to join in.  Accusing GM of "blackmailing" governments and workers in Europe to sign on to its "unacceptable" restructuring Plan, he also revoked prior labor commitments to contribute 388 million dollars in foregone benefits to the Magna sale.  BERLIN 00001395  002.2 OF 002    5. (C) Oliver Burkhardt, head of the Metal Workers in NRW, likewise condemned the decision as "bold and unfriendly," not only to Opel employees, but to the German government. However, Burkhardt conceded that he is waiting to see a long term GM plan for Opel that relies on more than cost-cutting and down-sizing.  In contrast to Klaus Franz, Burkhardt contended that non-German labor unions were "elated" over the failure of the Magna deal (which was tilted against workers in other countries) and doubted they would heed Franz's strike call.  He also predicted that the strikes in Germany will be short-term and largely symbolic rather than actual closures, adding "we are not going to close the door on a solution with GM."  Similarly, Fred Irwin - Citigroup's country manager in Germany and the Chair of the Opel Trust that oversaw the Magna negotiations - predicted that unions will eventually reconcile with GM once they realize there is no other choice.   While Despair Permeates Opel Executives ---------------------------------------  6.  (C) Opel managers such as Berlin Representative Uwe Berlinghoff, who almost uniformly favored the Magna contract, were also "taken completely by surprise" by the GM announcement.  Berlinghoff now expects GM to resurrect its pre-Magna restructuring plans, including closure of plants at Bochum (and Antwerp, Belgium) and the sale or closure of the Eisenach plant.  Berlinghoff also expected the German government to cancel the expected 4.5 billion dollar loan guarantee package, as "GM has demonstrated its lack of credibility with German politicians."   Research and Development and IPR Could be Key ---------------------------------------------  7. (C) German auto industry insiders have privately identified compelling reasons why GM cancelled the Magna deal.  Among these are the importance of the GM/Opel Research and Development facility in Ruesselsheim and its patents to GM's development of small efficient cars in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere.   GM was also reportedly skeptical that it could adequately protect crucial IPR from Russian exploitation because of the Sberbank/Gaz partnership with Magna.  Moreover, Magna had oversold its ability to penetrate the Russian market.  GM's announcement stressed its plans to build on its already significant business in Russia while retaining Opel and to work closely with Gaz without a Magna partnership.   But Auto Leader Welcomes the Move ---------------------------------  8.  (C) Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the CEO of BMW, told the Ambassador on November 4 that GM's move would be welcomed by the German auto industry.  Reithofer was adamant that there was no way BMW and the other German auto manufacturers would have purchased auto parts from Magna once it became a direct competitor as an auto manufacturer.  In Reithofer's view, Magna made the Opel purchase proposal in a moment of panic at the height of the economic crisis, but now that a recovery is in the offing, probably is not unhappy to see it dissolve.   Comment -------  9. (C) Despite the considerable German ire aimed at GM, much of it is aimed at GM's handling of Opel (in particular the timing of the November 3 announcement), rather than its business rationale for retaining its German subsidiary. Thoughtful German opinion leaders, including former Economics Minister zu Guttenberg conservatives in the German business community, were equally critical of Berlin's strong arm lobbying on behalf of Magna.  An Opel Trust Board Member and FDP politician Dirk Pfeil has already issued a statement urging Berlin to provide 3 billion Euro in state aid to keep GM afloat.  Like it or not, the German governments will need to seek an accommodation with GM to keep Opel alive.  MURPHY
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BERLIN 001403SIPDISDEPARTMENT FOR THE SECRETARY FROM THE AMBASSADORE.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2019TAGS: PGOV PREF MNUC AF RS IR KPAL KWBG GMSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY CLINTON'S VISIT TOBERLIN, NOVEMBER 8-10 Classified By: Ambassador Phillip Murphy for reasons 1.4 (b,d).1. (C) Summary: Embassy Berlin warmly welcomes you toGermany for the historic 20th Anniversary of the Fall of theBerlin Wall. Berlin is hosting all four-powers and EUleaders at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to mark this occasion.Your visit includes meetings with Chancellor Merkel andForeign Minister Westerwelle. Chancellor Merkel will likelyraise concern about General Motors' November 3 decision tokeep its German subsidiary, Opel, and Westerwelle may likelyraise his interest in removal of nuclear weapons fromGermany. You may wish to encourage from them:-- Assurances that the proposed Afghanistan conference willnot slip past January and that Germany will go immediately tothe Bundestag if increases in contributions are warranted;-- Support for including banking and insurance relations withIran in calculations for possible new sanctions, and nobacksliding on export controls;-- Assurances that Germany and the EU will work with the U.S.at Copenhagen and not seek to isolate;-- Agreement to tone down the public rhetoric on Opel;-- German prodding of Russia to engage constructively onsecurity issues and human rights.Recognizing Germany's prominent and international role onthis occasion is important to Merkel. She is still trying toget a sense of working with the new Washington Administrationand seems uncertain at times. Of course, Westerwelle islearning the ropes and being watched by Merkel to see if hecan be an effective FM for her. Alternatively, Merkel maylook to new Defense Minister zu Guttenberg (CSU) to play analternative role on foreign policy. End summary.Political Climate-----------------2. (C) The political divisions that marked the recentelection campaign, culminating in the October 28 swearing-inof a center-right coalition led by Chancellor Merkel, will beswept aside for your celebratory visit. Merkel just returnedfrom what she considers an exceptional visit to Washington,which front-paged her address to Congress in everypublication. Merkel will be focused on setting herpriorities for the next legislative term -- she gives a majorstate of the union-like address on November 10 on all issues-- and will seek U.S. cooperation in promoting economicrecovery and growth (Opel, regulation), progress inaddressing climate change (Copenhagen), and strengtheningGermany's international profile (Afghanistan). Westerwellewill have spent a total of some two days work in the foreignministry by the time your arrive. His ministry is not surewhat he wants yet.Economic Climate----------------3. (C) Germany's export-driven economy is showing initialsigns of recovery from its deepest recession since WW II.For the full year 2009, GDP will shrink around 5%, but shouldshow modest growth of 1% next year. Unemployment hasremained relatively low thanks to government-subsidizedprograms, but is expected to rise next year. Given thegovernment's record budget deficit, there is heated debateover the wisdom of the new coalition's proposed tax cuts,intended to boost growth. Germany was pleased with theoutcome of the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, but is keener onthe G-20's regulatory agenda than addressing globalimbalances.4. (C) GM's sudden decision on November 3 to cancel the saleof its European subsidiary Opel in a deal underwritten by theGerman government shocked and angered Germans. Merkel'schief economic advisor told the Ambassador November 4 thatMerkel was so furious at GM's about-face that she refused totake a call from GM CEO Fritz Henderson. Merkel subsequentlycalled the President. Federal and state governments aredemanding that GM immediately pay back 1.2 billion Euros inbridge loans they had extended to the car maker. Whatparticularly irked the Germans was that GM had failed toforewarn them of their latest flip-flop after months oflaborious negotiations and a total of 4.5 billion Euros inloans/guarantees in exchange for promises to retain most Opeljobs and plants in Germany. (Merkel found out about the GMdecision just hours after delivering her address beforeCongress.) The Opel story has dominated the news November4-5. Opel workers are likely to strike in the next few days,and politicians and others are citing the GM action asanother example of American "turbo-capitalism."Berlin 00001403 002 of 003Iran/Export Controls-----------------------5. (C) You should express appreciation for Merkel's strongstatement during her speech to Congress that there should be"zero tolerance" for Iranian acquisition of weapons of massdestruction. You should stress the importance of Germansupport for EU measures or measures taken by "like-minded"countries should a UNSCR be unattainable due to a possibleIranian rejection of the engagement track. With Westerwelle,it remains imperative that you raise the importance of P5 1unity again. In addition, you should stress the particularimportance of continued German leadership on export control,particularly in light of recent interdictions of Iranian armsshipments. The new German coalition seeks to expand exportsby normalizing German export control policy (of arms anddual-use items) with the EU. Germany contends that itsintention is to raise the EU to the German standard, but thedanger is that German standards could be watered down to anEU lowest common denominator.Arms Control/Disarmament------------------------6. (C) Westerwelle is on a bit of a tangent by publiclycalling for removal of nuclear weapons from Germany, althoughhe insists that Berlin will not act unilaterally. This getshim attention and he then offers assurances that everythingmust be done in the NATO context, but it distracts from otherissues. This is one of the few foreign policy positions thatdistinguishes his FDP from Chancellor Merkel's CDU, andWesterwelle may feel pressed to mention this. The MFAemphasizes that Westerwelle's position does not necessarilymean that Germany intends to cease participation in the NATOnuclear share. Germany may be willing to maintain its fleetof dual-capable aircraft, but have the applicable nuclearweapons stored in the U.S. or elsewhere. Westerwelle alsounderstands that some Allies may want to maintain theircurrent stock of NATO nuclear weapons. Your meeting withWesterwelle is a good opportunity to emphasize any red linesor concerns we have before this effort gets too far down theroad. For its part, the Chancellery, MFA and MOD areuncomfortable with Westerwelle's push and sees no reason totackle this issue right now.Afghanistan: Small Window for More Troops-----------------------------------------7. (C) FM Westerwelle has strongly defended Germanengagement in Afghanistan, both military and civilian, asvital to German national security interests. However, hesupports the Chancellor's recent decision to put off anyconsideration of deploying additional German soldiers untilafter the proposed international conference on Afghanistanearly next year, notwithstanding the significantlydeteriorated security situation in the north. The newgovernment sees theconference as critical for setting a new framework andbenchmarks for the international engagement in Afghanistan,as well as for prescribing what is expected of the Afghangovernment in return. It is in our interest to capitalize onthe Germans' sense of "ownership" of the north in getting acommitment from Westerwelle to seriously re-consider a troopincrease after the Afghanistan conference early next year,if, in fact, he and Merkel rule out any increase before then.Within this context, it would be important to acknowledgethat Germany is the fourth largest provider of civiliandevelopment assistance in Afghanistan and is an enthusiasticsupporter of the U.S. Focused District Development (FDD)civilian police training program, which it joined in Januaryof this year.Middle East-----------8. (C) You should thank Merkel for her strong statementsbefore Congress where she stressed the overarching importanceof Israel's security and a two-state solution. In general,Merkel has been very supportive of U.S. efforts in the MiddleEast. She is now planning the second round of German-Israeligovernment consultations, likely before the end of the year.She may raise this with you and seek your advice on messagesto Netanyahu. We understand that Westerwelle may also beplanning to visit Israel. The MFA said that Westerwelle mayseek a greater German role to promote peace, for example tooffer German support in coordinating Middle East policy withthe EU. According to the MFA, Westerwelle may also raise theconcept of creating some type of OSCE-like security structureBERLIN 00001403 003 of 003for the Middle East.Reluctance with Overseas Deployments------------------------------------9. (C) Germany continues to wrestle with the issue ofoverseas deployments. Westerwelle, and the FDP in general,tend to be more skeptical than Merkel's CDU on this topic andthis is reflected in the government coalition agreement. Thecoalition agreement calls for a "gradual reduction" of Germanparticipation in UNIFIL "with the perspective of bringing itto an end." Similarly, the agreement calls for a "criticalreview" of the "multitude" of parliamentary mandates for theBundeswehr to participate in counterterrorism and piracyoperations off the Horn of Africa, again with a view towardreducing them. It would be helpful for you to emphasize howimportant we view Germany's contributions to theseinternational operations.Russia/Energy Security----------------------10. (C) We expect Germany to be less forgiving of Russianbullying of its eastern European neighbors through cut-offsof natural gas supplies, especially given the departure offormer Foreign Minister Steinmeier -- known for hisrelatively pro-Russian views. Still, we expect Germany tocontinue to place a heavy emphasis on maintaining goodrelations with Russia, believing that constructive engagementand assistance with modernization are the best way to dealwith this difficult "strategic partner." Germany is Europe'slargest energy user and is highly dependent on Russia forenergy supplies, but Berlin does not view this as avulnerability, believing that Moscow is equally dependent onGermany as a consumer. Germany nevertheless recognizes thatit must diversify its sources of supply, routes, and means ofenergy generation to gain greater energy security.Climate Change--------------11. (C) As the Chancellor's remarks underline, Germanofficials want strong U.S. leadership going into theCopenhagen Summit. They are advocating for a unified US/EUposition towards the major emerging economies, particularlyChina and India, to urge them to commit to ambitious nationalactions at Copenhagen. They are looking for signals of ourcommitment to domestic and international actions that willallow us to collectively meet science-based targets. Germanleaders recognize the challenge of passing climate changelegislation in the U.S. and have lowered their expectationsfor the possibility of reaching a legally binding agreementnext month at Copenhagen. They have begun to describe theSummit as one step in a larger process -- a politicallybinding framework -- and may be preparing the German publicfor a less ambitious outcome.Mission Germany---------------12. (SBU) Madam Secretary, the U.S. government presence inGermany currently numbers 744 US direct-hire (USDH)employees, 683 locally engaged (LE) staff, and 951 USG EFMsand a State operating budget of $153 million annually. Thisincludes a Frankfurt cohort of over 500 USDH employees whoseresponsibilities support USG operations globally. Berlin'sUSG presence -- over 500 USDHs and LE staff -- is centered inthe new Chancery next to the Brandenburg Gate. The LE staffincludes many employees who have worked for the USG for over30 years.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BERLIN 001433  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/11/2019 TAGS: PREL MARR NATO MNUC PARM KNNP GM IR RU AFSUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR HEUSGEN ON AFGHANISTAN, MIDDLE EAST, IRAN, DETAINEES, RUSSIA, NUKES AND BALKANS  Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP D. MURPHY. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1. (C) SUMMARY.  Chancellery National Security Advisor Christoph Heusgen told EUR A/S Phil Gordon and Ambassador Murphy in a November 10 meeting in Berlin that Germany strongly preferred that the proposed international conference on Afghanistan be held outside the country to make it easier to press Karzai to commit to the necessary reforms.  On the Middle East, Heusgen thought Netanyahu had to do much more on settlements if there was to be any hope of re-starting negotiations.  On Iran, Heusgen hoped for some conclusion by early next month on whether the diplomatic track was going to bear fruit so that this issue could be discussed at the December 10 EU Summit.  Heusgen said Germany was ready to discuss taking Guantanamo detainees, but stressed the importance of dealing directly with the Ministry of Interior and keeping the negotiations confidential.  While arguing for being rhetorically supportive of the Medvedev European Security proposal, Heusgen shared U.S. skepticism about a new treaty and an OSCE Summit hosted by Kazakhstan.  Heusgen distanced the Chancellery from the proposal to remove all remaining tactical nuclear weapons from Germany, stressing the need to get reciprocal cuts from the Russians.  Also discussed was CFE, the Macedonian name issue and Bosnia.  END SUMMARY.  AFGHANISTAN  2. (C) Heusgen confirmed that Germany would only announce additional resources for Afghanistan after the proposed international conference, which Chancellor Merkel and UK PM Brown are now proposing for January 28 in London.  He said the conference is key because this is where the Germans expect the Afghan government to make specific commitments to improve governance and to gradually begin assuming responsibility from the international community.  President Karzai had to be put under international pressure to perform according to prescribed benchmarks.  Toward that end, the Chancellery felt strongly that the conference should be held outside of Afghanistan and not on Karzai's "home turf." Heusgen complained that the German and U.S. embassies in Kabul are on "a different track" and pushing for a conference in Kabul.  It was important to "make up our minds" quickly on the way ahead.  If the conference slipped to February or later, and the UK were no longer able to host it in view of the upcoming parliamentary elections there, then Germany would be willing to.  3. (C) Heusgen at first expressed concern that the U.S. would undermine international leverage on Karzai by rolling out its new strategy and resource commitments before he made any reciprocal commitments to reform.  Gordon assured him that the formal U.S. roll-out would only come after the November 19 inauguration, where Karzai is expected to "say the right things" in his inaugural address.  Gordon also highlighted the need to coordinate on the U.S. roll-out to avoid the perception that the U.S. was "Americanizing" the international effort in Afghanistan.  It should be announced as a common strategy and not as a U.S. strategy to which the Allies then respond.  Heusgen agreed in principle, but indicated that Germany would stick to its approach of holding back on any announcement of new commitments until after the international conference.  MIDDLE EAST  4. (C)  Referring to the Secretary's recent public statements on settlements, Heusgen said that Germany "perceives this differently" and thought Netanyahu needed "to do more" in order bring the Palestinians to the negotiating table.  With Palestinians in East Jerusalem getting notices from Israeli authorities that their houses will be destroyed, it would be "suicide" for President Abbas to move under the current circumstances.  Heusgen said he could not fathom why Netanyahu did not understand this.  He suggested pressuring Netanyahu by linking favorable UNSC treatment of the Goldstone Report to Israel committing to a complete stop in settlement activity.  Gordon said that making a direct linkage between the two would almost certainly be counterproductive, but agreed that it was worth pointing out to the Israelis that their policy on settlements was making it difficult for their friends to hold the line in the UNSC. Heusgen said this certainly would be an issue when Netanyahu and "half of his cabinet" visit Berlin on November 30 for bilateral government consultations.  IRAN  5. (C) Heusgen praised the U.S. for its patience with Iran,  BERLIN 00001433  002 OF 003   but noted that at some point, it would be necessary to move to the second track in order to maintain credibility. Heusgen said that he and his British counterpart agreed that ideally, there would be some conclusion on this by early next month so that the way ahead could be discussed by EU leaders at their summit on December 10.  Gordon agreed that there had to be a time limit, noting that President Obama had given the Iranians "by the end of the year" to respond favorably.  He also noted that the U.S. could support a Turkish role in the proposed exchange of low-enriched uranium for reactor fuel if that would make it easier for Iran to accept the deal. Gordon indicated, however, that Turkish PM Erdogan needed to be careful about losing credibility in Washington if he continued to make comments about Ahmadinejad being his "friend."  GUANTANAMO DETAINEES  6. (C) Heusgen noted that now that the Bundestag election was past, Germany was ready to help on detainees, as it had promised earlier.  He advised the USG to work directly with new Interior Minister de Maiziere, rather than going first to MFA and the Chancellery, which had irritated de Maiziere's predecessor and made him less willing to cooperate.  In this regard, he thought that it would be helpful if DHS Secretary Napolitano made direct contact with de Maiziere.  Heusgen also suggested that the discussions be kept confidential until MOI had come to a decision on which detainees to accept and in which state they would be settled.  Premature public disclosure could doom the whole initiative.  Heusgen said that Uighurs would be "too difficult," but that Germany could probably accept "2-3 others."  (Comment: The reluctance about Uighurs is due to the expected negative reaction of the Chinese government.  End Comment.)  EUROPEAN SECURITY PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE OSCE SUMMIT  7. (C) Heusgen said that while the West should try to react positively to whatever the Russians propose in advancing the Medvedev European security proposal, nothing should be accepted that would undermine current European security institutions, including the OSCE.  He shared Gordon's misgivings about a proposed treaty.  He was also skeptical about the idea of an OSCE Summit in Astana, agreeing that Kazakhstan's human rghts record and the lack of substantive agenda items made it unattractive.  Heusgen suggested that an OSCE Summit be offered to the Russians on the condition they solve the frozen conflict in Transnistria, which he said Moscow could accomplish "in about a month."  TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS  8. (C) In response to Gordon's question about how the government planned to take forward the commitment in the coalition agreement to seek the removal of all remaining nuclear weapons from Germany, Heusgen distanced the Chancellery from the proposal, claiming that this had been forced upon them by FM Westerwelle.  Heusgen said that from his perspective, it made no sense to unilaterally withdraw "the 20" tactical nuclear weapons still in Germany while Russia maintains "thousands" of them.  It would only be worth it if both sides drew down.  Gordon noted that it was important to think through all the potential consequences of the German proposal before going forward.  For example, a withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Germany and perhaps from Belgium and the Netherlands could make it very difficult politically for Turkey to maintain its own stockpile, even though it was still convinced of the need to do so.  CFE  9. (C) Gordon asked for Heusgen's views on a German CFE paper that had been delivered to the State Department just a few days earlier.  Heusgen said he did not know anything about it, claiming that he did not follow this issue closely or "believe in it."  He noted that MFA "loved this disarmament business," which was okay, but it had to be balanced or the "Russians will sit there and laugh."  MACEDONIAN NAME ISSUE  10. (C) Gordon briefed Heusgen on the current state of the negotiations, noting that the two key issues were the geographic modifier and international usage.  Heusgen noted that the Chancellor knew PM Macedonian Gruevski through their common membership in the European People's Party and would be willing to engage him on this issue if that would be helpful.  BOSNIA  BERLIN 00001433  003 OF 003    11. (C) Heusgen revealed that Serb President Tadic was coming to Berlin the week of November 16 for consultations.  He noted that while Tadic always claimed to be tough on Republika Srpska PM Dodic, he needed to be tougher.  While expressing pessimism about whether it would ever be possible to turn Bosnia into a "working state," Heusgen agreed it was important to keep trying. MURPHY

BERLIN 1393      B. BERLIN 1377      C. BERLIN 1167  Classified By: DCM Greg T. Delawie for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) SUMMARY: German Federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere overruled Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and abstained from voting at the November 30 COREPER vote in Brussels on an interim U.S.-EU agreement to continue the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program.  De Maiziere's decision allowed the agreement to pass and followed weeks of engagement in Berlin, Brussels and Washington as well as high-level interventions from Secretary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Geithner, Attorney General Holder, National Security Advisor Gen. Jones and Ambassador Murphy.  De Maiziere's decision was difficult for him to make given that the coalition agreement called for specific revisions to the SWIFT agreement, none of which Germany achieved, except a shortening of the interim period from 12 to 9 months.  The episode has tested Germany's new coalition government just weeks after its formation with Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger heavily criticizing the abstention.  This experience suggests that we will need to pay close attention to Germany during our negotiations on a long-term TFTP agreement.  END SUMMARY   Germany Relents Following Intense Pressure ---------------   2. (C)  Ambassador Murphy met with Interior Minister de Maiziere on November 27 and urged him to support U.S.-EU negotiations on an interim TFTP agreement, to which de Maiziere indicated that he would abstain from voting on the agenda item at the November 30 COREPER meeting.  De Maiziere's decision, which followed a German request to shorten the duration of the interim agreement to nine months rather than twelve, facilitated the passing of the agreement as Germany was the strongest holdout.  De Maiziere's decision followed two weeks of intense lobbying in Berlin, Brussels and Washington by Embassy Berlin, USEU, the Departments of Treasury, State and Justice and the NSC.  The campaign included calls by Secretaries Clinton, Geithner, the Attorney General and the National Security Advisor to their German counterparts.  State Department Counterterrorism Coordinator Benjamin urged support for the agreement during a two-day visit to Berlin (see septel).  Ambassador Murphy twice wrote to all five relevant ministers (Interior, Justice, Finance, Chancellery, and MFA) and made repeated calls to senior decision makers, stressing the importance of the interim agreement and the need for Germany to not block it.  The DCM, Econ M/C, and staff from multiple embassy sections heavily engaged on the issue as well.   3. (C)  De Maiziere (CDU) stressed that his decision was not an easy one given that the Christian Democrat/Social Union (CDU/CSU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP) coalition had differing views on the TFTP program.  The outcome particularly irritated Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger because she had expressed concerns about the TFTP dating back to the initial July decision to give the negotiating mandate to the Swedish EU Presidency.  Furthermore, in October Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger had inserted language into the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition agreement specifically addressing the TFTP negotiations and directing Germany to call upon the EU to work towards a higher level of data protection (see Ref B).  Following de Maiziere's decision, the Justice Minister complained that her views were ignored and that the decision has "upset millions of citizens of Europe."  De Maiziere told the Ambassador that he would be expressing some criticisms of the agreement publicly in order to reflect MoI concerns and to deflect public criticism.  He was subsequently quoted as saying that "a not completely satisfactory agreement is better than none at all."   BERLIN 00001528  002 OF 002    German Vote Comes with Costs for the Coalition ----------   4. (C) De Maiziere intimated, and working level contacts have confirmed, that Germany would like to avoid a repeat of our all-out lobbying effort during the negotiations for a long-term TFTP agreement.  De Maiziere's strong preference is to seek consensus with his ministry colleagues.  He particularly wants to avoid another clash with the Justice Minister on this issue as it has caused no small amount of discord between the new coalition partners, who are having a rocky start on a number of fronts.  The incident is particularly difficult for de Maiziere as he entered the Interior Ministry stressing that he represented a break from his predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble, whom he felt overly focused on security issues (see Ref A).  De Maiziere surely finds this whole experience regrettable as it put him in exactly the position he did not want to be in: seemingly siding with the U.S. over German interests, causing disruption within the coalition, and compromising the data privacy rights of German citizens.   Engaging the FDP on Data Privacy ---------   5. (C) It is not altogether surprising that this disagreement arose given the FDP's reputation as a staunch defender of citizens' privacy rights (see Ref C).  Nevertheless, the intensity of this dispute should be a wake up call - we must avoid repeating this as we look to completing the long-term U.S.-EU TFTP agreement.  The coalition agreement calls for strict limitations on the use of TFTP data, no automatic access to the system, data deletion requirements, clear rules on sharing information with third parties and legal redress. These positions will guide Germany's views in the follow-on negotiations, and we need to consider how to take them into account in a way that does not complicate TFTP implementation.  6. (C) Embassy Berlin is examining how we can reach out to FDP ministers and parliamentarians to educate them on U.S. data protection structures as this experience has demonstrated that they are often misinformed on the nature of our policies.  We will likewise reach out to CDU/CSU decision makers, in part to enlist their help in reaching the German public.  We also intend to make the point that countering terrorism in a globalized world, where terrorists and their supporters use open borders and information technology to quickly move people and financing, requires robust international data sharing.

(C/NF) Summary: In separate December 1 meetings with Ambassador Dan Fried, Special Envoy for Closure of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility (S/GC), the Ministry of the Interior, Foreign Ministry and Chancellery expressed a willingness to consider seven new cases of Guantanamo detainees for resettlement as well as three cases that had already been provided to the former government last spring. All interlocutors stressed that the MOI is the competent ministry handling this issue.  They also expressed the desire to be helpful in the spirit of the strong U.S.-German bilateral relationship.  Interior Ministry State Secretary Beus said that any decision on the cases would likely take up to two months and agreed with S/E Fried on the following way forward:  -- the Interior Ministry would be the only ministry addressing this issue, especially in regard to sharing information on the detainees; -- the U.S. and Germany will uphold strict confidentiality during this review phase and coordinate timing and content of any public messages; -- while Germany prefers non-Uighur cases because of expected tension with China, it will consider the cases of two Uighurs based on humanitarian grounds; -- Germany prefers to accept detainees with a connection to Germany, which S/E Fried explained to be the case with only one detainee, a Tunisian whose file was previously provided; -- the German MOI will maintain direct communication with S/GC at this stage in the process; -- Germany will decide on the need to interview any candidates at the end of its review process.  In a later meeting, Chancellery Security Advisor Christoph Heusgen stressed his confidence in Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere to handle this issue, noting de Maiziere's close relationship with Chancellor Merkel.  End summary.  Interior Ministry is Key ------------------------  2.  (C/NF) Based on a schedule recommended by the Chancellery, S/E Fried and Ambassador Murphy met first with Interior Ministry State Secretary Beus and expressed appreciation for the new government's willingness to consider resettling detainees.  S/E Fried reviewed the numerous European countries which had accepted or pledged to resettle detainees at this point, noting that progress has been made but more is needed.  He noted he would only be passing along detainee dossiers to the MOI and discussing case specifics with the MOI, and not with other Government ministries, per earlier requests from the government.  S/E Fried handed over the dossiers of seven detainees: two Egyptians, two Syrians, a Libyan, and two Palestinians.  He explained that if the MOI has questions or requires additional information, it can do so through established liaison channels and additionally offered for a German team to visit Guantanamo to conduct interviews with detainees under consideration.  While recognizing Germany's preference for non-Uighur detainees, S/E Fried raised two Uighur cases for consideration based on humanitarian grounds, one who has psychological problems and the other, his brother, who serves as a caregiver.  He also acknowledged the German interest in detainees who have some connection to Germany, noting the one Tunisian case whose file had been conveyed last spring as the single detainee with those ties to Germany.  In total, S/E Fried requested that Germany consider 10 detainee cases for resettlement, three cases already conveyed and seven new cases.  3.  (C/NF) State Secretary Beus expressed his ministry's willingness to consider all the cases, including the Uighurs, and said that his experts would review the files as soon as possible.  Shortly after he began, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere dropped in to stress his desire to be of help. Continuing, Beus underlined the importance of keeping the current discussions and review of the detainees confidential, to which S/E Fried strongly agreed.  Beus underlined Germany's preference for detainees who have some ties to Germany, noting that this connection would provide the government with a "plausible" explanation for accepting certain detainees when faced with the argument that the U.S. should be resettling them.  Beus said that he would be willing to consider the two Uighur cases on humanitarian grounds, but noted that they would present special difficulties because of the diplomatic row which would likely  ensue.  Beus also highlighted that even if the federal government agrees to accept any detainees, it must then find a German state willing to accept them.  He also said that German services would naturally keep an eye on any resettle detainees within reasonable resource means.  4.  (C/NF) Beus also expressed strong interest in coordinating the timing and content of any public message on Germany's consideration of and decision on resettling detainees to prevent political pressure from those who oppose the move, but regardless the government will advocate in public in favor of taking detainees if they come to a positive decision.  He added that being able to say to the public that the U.S. has also accepted detainees or otherwise explain why the U.S. is not doing so would also be helpful. S/E Fried expressed his readiness to coordinate and noted that the U.S. has admitted and plans to admit the more dangerous detainees for legal proceedings.  Process and Timeframe ---------------------  5.  (C/NF) Beus said that he and his experts would review the files and determine if additional information is needed.  He agreed that additional information would go through intelligence channels and expressed his preference to communicate directly with S/E Fried on any matters at this stage of the process.  He said that they would decide whether interviews are necessary when the experts have completed their review of the information.  He estimated that a decision on taking detainees would take one-to-two months.  MFA Plays Peripheral Role -------------------------  6.  (C/NF) It was clear from the later meeting with MFA State Secretary Wolf Born that the Foreign Office would not be a major decision-maker as on this issue.  S/E Fried reviewed in general terms the cases of detainees that we are asking the MOI to consider and also highlighted the humanitarian nature of the two Uighur cases, which Born noted.  Born said that Foreign Minister Westerwelle wants to be "positive," but added that it is the MOI which is the "competent" ministry on this issue.  Born mainly asked questions about the numbers of detainees still at Guantanamo, U.S. plans for addressing the various groups, and the possible closing date, all of which S/E Fried discussed with him.  Chancellery Confirms Reticence about Uighurs --------------------------------------------  7.  (C/NF) In the last meeting, Chancellery Security and Foreign Policy Advisor Christoph Heusgen expressed appreciation that S/E Fried had proceeded along the lines that the MOI and Chancellery had requested through Ambassador Murphy.  Heusgen appeared to be already fully briefed on S/E Fried's earlier meeting that day with Beus.  He told S/E Fried that if Germany were to take any Uighurs, it would be best to do so in combination with other European countries to prevent China from focusing its opposition on any one country.  Heusgen was not optimistic that China would demonstrate any understanding for the two humanitarian cases.  Heusgen inquired as to whether any alternatives for the Uighurs exists.  S/E Fried explained possible options, while highlighting the difficulty of resettling the two individuals he is asking Germany to consider.  Comment -------  8.  (C/NF) The new government, now in place since October 29, appears willing to renew consideration of resettling GTMO detainees and has expressed a clear desire to be of help.  In contrast to former Interior Minister Schaeuble, current MOI de Maiziere has not (and is unlikely to) flouted security concerns about cases in the press, nor indicated that Germany would be hardpressed to accept any detainees put forth for security reasons.  Nor has de Maiziere indicated that the fact that the U.S. itself has not resettled detainees presents an insurmountable roadblock, although Beus indicated that U.S. resettlement would help Germany's PR efforts to resettle.  All interlocutors expressed a strong interest in keeping the matter confidential and coordinating the timing and content of any public message.  Beus projected sincerity and realism, noting that even if the federal government agrees, it must still identify a state that is willing to resettle the detainees.  While all interlocutors did not outright reject the two Uighur cases, Heusgen made clear that the prospect of being the only European country to irritate China by accepting Uighurs would make it difficult, although  it is unclear whether Germany would take part in any broader European decision to resettle Uighurs.  9. (SBU) There has to date been no mention in the press of S/E Fried's visit.  10.  (U) This cable has been cleared by S/E Dan Fried. MURPHY
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BERLIN 001577  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/15/2019 TAGS: PGOV PREL KNNP ETTC EFIN IR GMSUBJECT: NOW FOR THE HARD PART: MERKEL,S TEAM EXAMINES NEXT STEPS IN IRAN  Classified By: Ambassador Philip D. Murphy for reasons 1.4 b/d.  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Chancellor Merkel set the German agenda on Iran with her early November statement before the U.S. Congress on "zero tolerance" for a nuclear armed Iran and the need for tougher sanctions should engagement not work. During a private roundtable hosted by Ambassador Murphy, however, members of Germany's Iran "brain-trust" from the German Parliament, MFA, Ministry of Economics and top government funded think tank welcomed the President's engagement policy, recommended broadening the dialogue to areas of cooperation (drugs, Afghanistan, diplomatic relations), betrayed little beyond a superficial knowledge of the nuclear program, argued that Germany took the largest economic hit from recent sanctions, and expressed doubts as to the efficacy of sanctions, giving us a window into the difficult task Chancellor Merkel will have in keeping her government on her page.  In the end, we assess that Merkel will have her way. END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) The November 24 event at the Embassy included members of Parliament from the four main German political parties: FDP Elke Hoff, CDU Andreas Schockenhoff, Greens Kerstin Mueller, and SPD Rolf Muetzenich.  From the MFA, Policy Planner Markus Ederer, DG for Economics Ruediger von Fritsch, DG for Disarmament and Nonproliferation Amb. Peter Gottwald, and Iran Task Force Director Andreas Krueger attended. Ministry of Economics DG for External Economic Policy Karl-Ernst Brauner and the Director of the German government funded research institute Stiftung fuer Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP, or Institute for Science and Politics) Volker Perthes also attended.  ----------------------------------------- MFA: TRR Not Dead Yet; But Not Well Either -----------------------------------------  3.  (C) The Ambassador opened the discussion by thanking the German government for its excellent cooperation on Iran and asked his guests to share their thoughts on the Iranian internal situation, especially given recent reports of the expanded role of the IRGC in the cultural/educational spheres of life, and how that might affect Iran's external policy. MFA DG for Disarmament Gottwald stated that if we were correct in assessing the Iranian regime's primary goal to be survival, then we still had a chance with a negotiated solution.  He said that while the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) deal was not "well," Germany wasn't ready to pronounce it "dead" quite yet.  He concluded with a strong statement saying that a nuclear armed Iran would be a nightmare in and of itself and a disastrous blow to the NPT regime which was why Germany would be a strong partner in support of further sanctions.  4.  (C) MFA Policy Planer Ederer said he thought Iran was confused about what it wants and that the West might be even more confused about how to get what we want.  He said we want Iranian behavior change, but we don't agree yet what will get us there.  He said UN sponsored sanctions would isolate Iran and limit its capacity, but questioned whether they would change Tehran's behavior.  He said he realized sanctions remained a good alternative to military action, but questioned whether they were really capable of anything other than just buying time.  ------------------------------------------ More Carrots before we Reach for the Sticks ------------------------------------------  5.  (C) SWP's Perthes argued Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei's primary interest was to maintain the security of the system and prevent regime change.  Perthes said Khamenei feared a velvet revolution over all else, though regional instability was a close second.  He noted Iran remained besieged by problems of drug smuggling, piracy, and instability in Pakistan.  He recommended more emphasis be placed on trying to find an incentive for the regime to cooperate on the regional track, which had already shown some progress.  He said the April 2009, 300 million dollar Iranian pledge at the Pakistan donor's conference was an important symbol of the value the regime placed on regional security. He suggested the West "broaden" relations with Iran to areas where cooperation could be had: drugs, Afghanistan, and diplomatic (especially Consular) ties.  POL M/C noted this was fine, but ignored the fact that time was not on our side.  Rather, Iran was installing new centrifuges each week.  If Iran wanted to build confidence or "broaden" relations, it could modulate that pace, but time was not a luxury we had. Gottwald agreed emphatically.  BERLIN 00001577  002 OF 003    6.  (C) Changing course, Perthes said that if "sticks" had to be used, he suggested more focus on "export-control" and less on sanctions. He noted evidence suggested export control regimes had already worked in slowing down centrifuge progress.  He concluded by saying that if sanctions must be used, we should avoid all use of the word "crippling" and instead focus on "targeted" sanctions in order not to turn the Iranian masses against us and right back into Ahmadinejad's hands.  He also suggested that "unofficial" sanctions such as Russia's decision not to sell the S300s were more effective than most formal sanctions.  If formal sanctions had to be pursued he said only global sanctions would be effective, and therefore advocated UNSC action. Perthes said he saw readiness in the German business community to accept financial loss if sanctions were truly global, but they don't want to see business opportunities being lost to China or India.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Green Party : Too Late to Prevent, Need To Contain --------------------------------------------- ----  7.  (C) From the opposition, Green Party Foreign Policy Spokesperson Kerstin Mueller said she was glad that the new U.S. administration no longer talked about a threat of a military option.  But she also said she was skeptical that Iran can be prevented from obtaining a nuclear capability without a military option, and that it might even be too late for a military option to be effective.  She said she didn't see compromise within the interests of the regime and thought the West should focus more attention on how to "control" a nuclear-armed Iran.  ------------------------------------------- FDP: Rank and File Grudging Partner on Iran? --------------------------------------------  8.  (C) FDP Spokeswoman on Defense Policy, Elke Hoff opened her remarks with a grudging acknowledgment of the coalition agreement in which her party agreed that if engagement with Iran on the nuclear dossier failed, sanctions would be implemented.  She added that she remained personally skeptical as to their efficacy.  She said additional sanctions would serve the unintended consequence of rallying the masses around Ahmadinejad.  9.  (C) Hoff said she often hears from constituents in the business community that German companies are getting pressured from their American counterparts not to do business in Iran, and yet they see plenty of U.S. products for sale in Iran. Econ M/C intervened and stressed that the U.S. was ready to prosecute any U.S. businesses in violation of U.S. sanctions and had already done so.  Hoff also suggested offering German businesses financial compensation should new sanctions come into play.  In response to a criticism from Hoff on whether the U.S. deadline created for engagement on Iran reflected Obama's domestic political agenda, the Ambassador emphasized the deep commitment of the administration to engagement.  ---------------------------- Germany is the Largest Loser ----------------------------  10.  (C) MFA DG for Economics Von Fritsch agreed with Perthes' suggestion to focus more on the carrots and not the sticks.  He noted that no single country has (recently) sacrificed as much financially as Germany has, not just in existing trade, but also in long term future contracts.  Econ M/C noted that U.S. business had also suffered enormous trade and investment losses after 1979.  Von Fritsch said if sanctions were inevitable, German business preferred global and clear sanctions as opposed to vague wording that can be left open to differing interpretations.  On correspondent banking relations, Von Fritsch said the German government was still examining the issue but that a complete severance of correspondent banking relations including with Iran's central bank would not be possible since it would amount to a total trade embargo.  11.  (C) Ministry of Economics DG for External Policy Brauner referenced the inclusion in German law of the presumptive right to trade, and said that he was concerned that what the German Customs and BAFA (export control agency under the Ministry of Economics) were doing to encourage "Nullbescheid" (pre-certification that specific trade with Iran is not illicit) might actually be illegal, as German business had complained.  He said one important consideration for Germany  BERLIN 00001577  003 OF 003   was that a further crackdown on trade with Iran could endanger repayment of the 4.5 billion Euros in outstanding credits that Iran owed Germany. Germany had agreed not to issue any new credit under its Hermes (OPIC-like) program, but expected to be able to collect on outstanding credits. Nonetheless, both Brauner and Von Fritsch emphasized that in the event of no progress in negotiations with Iran, Germany was ready to enter a new round of stronger sanctions, and that we should look to Chancellor Merkel's statements in the U.S. Congress and FM Westerwelle's reiterations of her strong policy as the final say on which direction Germany would go on Iran.  12.  (C) CONCLUSION.  The majority of the guests at the table distinctly deferred to Perthes for guidance on where the Iran issue might be headed or should be headed.  This was striking amongst such a high ranking group of people operationally involved with the Iran issue.  Also illuminating was the variety of talking points employed by the participants to define hurdles for sanction until debunked one at a time by Embassy officers.  The candor with which even some MFA and Ministry of Economics officials expressed their skepticism on the efficacy of pursuing tougher sanctions on Iran may mean that Merkel will have to press hard within her own government to deliver on her promise of implementing tougher sanctions should engagement with Iran fail.  None of our interlocutors, however, questioned whether Merkel would, at the end of the day, be able to "deliver" on her promises.  If and when we decide to go forward on the pressure track on Iran, the USG may wish to reinforce Merkel's position by showing appreciation for Germany's strong continuing support.  END CONCLUSION.

(SBU) SUMMARY:  Dirk Niebel (FDP) was an odd pick as Germany's new Development Minister -- he had no experience in international development, and had previously suggested abolishing the Development Ministry.  Now in charge, Niebel has big shoes to fill, following on the heels of Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul (SPD).  Important differences with his predecessor are already apparent: he would like to integrate Germany's development policy more closely with its foreign and security policy, including in Afghanistan.  Niebel is also a firm believer in free markets, and sees a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round as critical for developing countries.  For Niebel, nothing is sacrosanct: he intends to phase out German aid to China, which he regards as no longer a developing country.  With the ministry under new management, there may be additional opportunities for collaboration between the United States and Germany on development policy.  END SUMMARY.  DIRK WHO? ---------  2.  (SBU) Dirk Niebel struck many as an unlikely choice for Development Minister in the coalition government of Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) and Guido Westerwelle's Free Democratic Party (FDP) (the "Black-Yellow" coalition). A Hamburg native, Niebel's previous work experience includes eight years as a paratrooper in the German armed forces, and five years as a placement officer at a job center in Heidelberg.  In 1998, he was elected to the Bundestag (lower house of Parliament), where he became caucus spokesperson for labor market policy and a member of the Labor Committee.  In 2005, FDP Chairman (and current Foreign Minister) Westerwelle tapped him as FDP Secretary General -- a position he held until Chancellor Merkel appointed him Development Minister in November 2009.  As Secretary General, Niebel had called for the elimination of the ministry he would later head, the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). (NOTE: This option appears off the table for now. END NOTE) Niebel succeeds Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who headed BMZ for a record 11 years.   CONNECTED SECURITY ------------------  3.  (SBU) In a December 18 meeting with Ambassador Murphy, Niebel said he intended to "make some changes at BMZ."  One such change is linking development policy more closely with foreign and security policy -- a concept he referred to as "connected security."   Niebel told the Ambassador he planned to coordinate very closely with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, and that he foresaw much greater cooperation between BMZ and the German military in northern Afghanistan. (NOTE: Days prior to the meeting with Ambassador Murphy, Niebel had announced BMZ would increase civilian assistance to Afghanistan by around 50 million euros, bringing Germany's 2009 total to over 260 million euros. END NOTE)  4. (SBU) In a separate meeting several months ago, Chancellery National Security Advisor Christoph Heusgen had told us that BMZ under a Black-Yellow coalition would be less wedded to "old" notions of doing development work.  This assessment now appears to be accurate.   Wiezcorek-Zeul had ensured that German development staff worked and lived in separate compounds, away from provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) and other bases from which the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Interior operated.  She even refused to ride in German military vehicles when she visited Afghanistan.  This kind of separation seems likely to end under Niebel, both physically and substantively.  5. (SBU) Among other ideas Niebel brings to the table is a plan to partner with third country donors like Israel on projects in developing countries.  Niebel told the Ambassador that Israel,s expertise in border protection could be shared  BERLIN 00001609  002.3 OF 002   with African countries, for example.  By teaming up with Germany, Israel could participate in certain capacity building projects where it might not otherwise have access.  LAISSEZ-FAIRE DEVELOPMENT -------------------------  6. (SBU) Shortly after becoming Minister, Niebel remarked that his overall development philosophy was helping recipient countries help themselves.  He regards the successful conclusion of World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Doha Development Round as especially meaningful for developing countries.  "There is more money being lost by trade barriers than all the development aid can make up for," he said.  This perspective marks a noteworthy departure from the approach of Wieczorek-Zeul, dubbed "red Heide" for her affiliation with the Young Socialists years ago.  7. (SBU) Niebel also opposes a proposed tax on international financial transactions to fund development assistance.  Both Chancellor Merkel and Wieczorek-Zeul had championed the so-called "Tobin tax."  Citing "differences" within the government on the issue, Niebel has reportedly ended BMZ's participation in an international working group on the proposed tax.  8.  (SBU) Niebel is keen to reorient BMZ's assistance. Reflecting on comments made publicly in his first days as Minister, Niebel told Ambassador Murphy that Germany planned to stop providing development assistance to China, currently one of the largest recipients of German aid.  He added that China was "only a developing country when it came to climate change negotiations."  BMZ will carry out its existing aid obligations to China only through next year.  The decision has proved controversial, as BMZ's assistance to China had reportedly benefitted German companies doing business there.  TRAVEL PLANS ------------  9. (SBU) Niebel said he planned to spend the holidays in Israel.  (NOTE: Niebel is a long-standing member of the German-Israeli Society. END NOTE) His first official travel to the developing world will be a late January trip to "Rwanda, eastern Congo, Mozambique, Afghanistan and Asia." The Ambassador suggested Niebel visit Washington to meet with new USAID Administrator Shah once confirmed.  Niebel said he would coordinate dates for the visit with the Embassy.  COMMENT -------  10. (SBU) Niebel takes charge of BMZ at a challenging time: Germany will run its largest post-war deficit in 2010, and pressure to rein in spending will strain every ministry. Niebel's close relationship with Westerwelle should be an asset, however, and could help minimize cuts on key priorities.  The close relationship will also facilitate Niebel's vision of integrating development policy with foreign and security policy.  Since taking over at BMZ, Niebel has increased assistance to Afghanistan, where Germany was already the third largest donor, and appears open to doing more in support of an integrated strategy in the north.  An early meeting between the new USAID Administrator, who oversees the world's largest aid budget, and the new German Development Minister, who oversees the world's second largest, could be an important step in building stronger U.S.-German cooperation on our top development priorities.

Lead Stories Summary  The majority of dailies opened with reports on the failed terror attack on a Delta Airlines jet, while Sueddeutsche headlined: "Protests Intensify - Riots in Iran" and FAZ led with the headline:  "People Killed in Demonstrations in Iran."  Editorials focused on the failed terror attack in the U.S., with the unrest in Iran and with the state of the coalition government in Berlin.  ZDF-TV's early evening  newscast heute and ARD-TV's early evening newscast Tagesschau opened  with a report on violent clashes between the Iranian regime and opponents.  2.   (U.S.)   Failed Terrorist Attack  All papers carry extensive reports the failed terrorist attack on a  Delta Airlines airliners and reported that travelers flying to the United States must expect heightened security measures and tougher restrictions on their flights to the United States.  Die Welt headlined: "Terror Attempt Stirring up fear of Terror," while Financial Times headlined: "Fear of Terror is Back."  In a front-page editorial, Die Welt (12/28) judged: "The fact that the would-be attacker was able to board a plane with his dangerous material reveals gaps in the control system.  With metal detectors alone chemical explosives cannot be discovered."  Under the headline: "Flight 253," Frankfurter Allgemeine (12/28) opined: "If someone really had believed that we have transnational terror under control, and that we can give an all-clear signal with  respect to security, then those people have now been taught better.  Irrespective of whether the attacker acted on his own or on the instructions of al-Qaida, the danger is not over and that is why travelers, not only to the Untied States, must accept new inconveniences which are hopefully useful."  "Following the terror attempt in Detroit, the usual security debate  will now begin," Frankfurter Rundschau (12/28) noted, and added: "controls will be heightened, and agencies are trying to get us to do everything possible to prevent another attack.  This failed terror attempt shows how unpredictable people can be who stop at nothing.  For the time being, there is only one lesson we can learn from the events on Flight 253: It is the courageous effort of Jasper Schuringa who prevented even worse events.  The unexpected resolve of individuals can be the right answer to the threat that comes out of  the blue."  In the view of Stuttgarter Zeitung (12/28), "Abdulmutallab was miles   BERLIN 00001626  002 OF 005   away from the organizational level of the 9/11 attackers.  But the Nigerian national succeeded in one thing:  he totally unnerved the western world, and the terror fighting machinery of the United States in particular.  Even though the U.S. government knew about the danger of the young man, he was able to fly around the world without difficulty.  Almost without any problems, he was able to smuggle dangerous substances aboard an aircraft.  But what if he really had  the order from al-Qaida in Yemen to blow up the plane?  How does this view then fit the U.S. focus on Afghanistan?  Is Yemen, too, a front  in the anti-terror war?  Many question, but only a few answers."  Regional daily Nrnberger Nachrichten (12/28) and regional daily Trierischer Volksfreund (12/28) judged: "How was it possible for a young man to get aboard with a one-way ticket and an Arabic sounding  name, whose contacts with Islamic extremists were known and whose father even warned the U.S. embassy?  The lists of passengers travelling to the United States are transferred in advance to the U.S. Homeland Security Department with all its data bases.  But again we  see a big hole in the net that is supposed to capture potential terrorists.  Of course, one hundred percent security will never exist, but these gaps are dramatic and should be an alarm call which politicians should not ignore."  Mannheimer Morgen (12/28) warned against hysteria and judged: "Each  day terror investigators receive hundreds of tips and indications.  How is it then possible to follow a vague suspicion?  We should not  exaggerate security measures for flights.  The fact that in the United States no one is allowed to go to the bathroom one hour before landing is ridiculous.  The same is true for the ban on liquids in Europe.  Here there is a clear disproportion between cost and benefit." MQrkische Allgemeine of Potsdam (12/28) opined: "If airlines, as a reaction to the failed attempt, force their passengers to remain seated one hour before landing, then this is no more than a gesture of helplessness.  The second much more important aspect may be dissatisfying at the moment, but there is no way around it: Muslims  must preach again and again in their own ranks that terror is not the culmination of piety but a crime.  Any incident like this should stress to the Muslim world how urgent this message is."  Regional daily Westdeutsche Zeitung of Dsseldorf (12/28) observed:  "Hectic measure such as barring passengers from getting up should not prevail in the long run.  In the future, there will be no way around  finding the right balance between possible improvements of our security standards compared to the trouble caused by them."SchwarzwQlder Bote (12/28) noted: "Everything we have learned  about this attack does not strengthen our confidence in international  BERLIN 00001626  003 OF 005   security measures.  It is certainly right that there cannot be absolute security from mean terrorist attacks but this does not the  least excuse the gaps in anti-terror measures.  3.   (Iran)   New Protests  All papers carry extensive coverage of the new clashes between the regime and opposition forces in Iran.   Sueddeutsche headlined: "Protests Intensify - Riots in Iran" and FAZ led with the headline:  "People Killed in Demonstrations in Iran."  Frankfurter Rundschau reported on its front page: "The protests are directed against Iranian President Ahmadinejad."  The paper also reported that "according to  reports from Tehran, police officers partly disobeyed orders to use  their guns against the protesters.  The Internet page "Jaras," which  is critical of the government, reported that 'some [police officers]  tried to fire their guns in the air when their superiors put pressure on them.'"  Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) said in an editorial under the headline: "There is Growing Unrest among the People" that "if the information  fragments from Tehran on the demonstrations during the Ashura holidays allow one conclusion, then this one: the rank and file of the protests are now overtaking their leaders.  Posters of religious leader Ali Khamenei and the chorus of demonstrators who want to see the dictator dead do not correspond with the slogans of the two opposition leaders Moussawi and Charrubi.  They are now faced with a dilemma:  If they  stick to their view that they, in principle, recognize the institutions of the Islamic republic and want to use the courts to make their political opposition heard, then it could be that their followers will leave them because many want something else: regime change."  Regional daily Suedwest Presse of Ulm (12/28) editorialized: "The regime is using all its might to extinguish the massive protests. The few Internet reports in any case show the brutality of the leading clique around President Ahmadinejad.  In the meantime, the regime has its back to the wall.  The protests are no longer confined to Tehran  but are spreading to other cities....  The government can no longer  afford the good deeds with which it bought the loyalty of Iranians.  All this is really worrying for the international community of nations."  Ostsee Zeitung of Rostock (12/28) argued: "Despite jammed cellular phone networks and despite blocked access to the Internet, the unrest in Iran hardly seems to be stoppable.  The resistance is still limited to a well-educated cosmopolitan, young, urban middle class.  Large sectors of the population, however, seem to keep quiet or seem to  BERLIN 00001626  004 OF 005   support the regime.  But the cyber revolt in Tehran has demonstrated  that the mullahs no longer enjoy a monolithic power."  Regional daily Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten (12/28) opined: "Since the allegedly manipulated re-election of President Ahmadinejad, a state of emergency has dominated in Iran.  But this is not only the struggle of a limited political protest movement against the president and the ayatollahs behind him.  The country is now facing an endurance test.  At issue is whether the country wants to become a fundamental religious state or an Islamic republic.   The pictures from Iran are  shocking.  It is the violence on both sides that makes us fear the worst."  4.   (China)   Reaction to Jailing of Liu Xiabo  Frankfurter Allgemeine (12/28) editorialized under the headline: "Co- Responsibility," that foreign countries must also be blamed that a man like Liu Xiabo is jailed with such an absurdly high prison term. The foreign countries have treated China for economic considerations with political kid gloves for years.  We can't blame China under these circumstances because we think that it is unassailable?  A positive  reaction to any criticism of the verdict cannot be expected."  Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) said in an editorial: "A subtle but clearly visible trend is getting hold in China.  Civil disobedience  among the rank and file is spreading.  It is an irony that this tend  has become visible in the tough verdict against Liu Xiabo.  In front  of the court in which China's leadership organized the show trial, we could not only see international reporters and diplomats, but Chinese supporters of Liu shouted slogans and unrolled posters thus deliberately risking their arrest.  Only a few courageous people went to the court, but they showed that intimidation no longer works as successfully as in the past.  This new trend is not only confined to  the traditional political protest.  Courageous lawyers of the Weiquan civil rights movement are defending victims of the arbitrariness of  state agencies and they defend each other, too.  And the number of peaceful and violent civil protests is on the rise.  But the Chinese  Communist Party fails miserably when it comes to channeling communication with its critics into a constructive direction.  The verdict against Liu Xiabo is one more example.  It will only partially obtain the desired effect but not intimidate the people.  At the same time, new embitterment, new disobedience is growing.  With each show  trial, the party is now doing of what it is accusing Liu: it undermines the state's authority."   BERLIN 00001626  005 OF 005   5.   (U.S.)   Healthcare Reform  Under the headline: "Reform Blues," Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) had  this to say: "There is no doubt that the healthcare reform bill that  has now been adopted in the Senate is a great work...and trailblazing. But enthusiasm about the success is limited.  One reason is that the  legislative process is so tiresome; but there is an even more important reason: disappointment and doubts are spreading.  The advocates of the reform have been brought down to earth again because they were able to implement only a few of their demands.   Thus far,  the Democrats have lost the fight for public opinion.  They will have to do quite a lot in the election campaign in 2010 to avoid being punished for a reasonable reform."  Die Welt (12/28) argued: "The Democrats will now have difficulty explaining to their irritated voters why it is historic progress that 31 million compatriots who have no coverage today will get health insurance, and that health insurance companies can no longer reject  sick Americans or demand astronomically high premiums.  This reform is supposed to carry itself and not burden the budget.  But the opponents to the bill do not believe a word, arguing that the nation will go bankrupt.  This is a highly imperfect, weakened bill and, at the same time, a giant step forward into an American future in which job loss  no longer means the end of insurance protection for a former employee and their whole family."

UNCLAS BERLIN 001636  STATE PASS to EEB STATE PASS TO USTR  SENSITIVE  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ECON EFIN ETRD ELAB GMSUBJECT: Lame Duck German Governor Kicked Upstairs as New Energy Commissioner in Brussels  REF: Frankfurt 002808 Sensitive but unclassified; not for Internet Distribution. 1. (SBU) Chancellor Angela Merkel nominated Baden- Wuerttemberg (BW) Minister President Guenther Oettinger as EU Energy Commissioner primarily to remove an unloved lame duck from an important CDU bastion.  The move was not the promotion of a valued colleague as Merkel's allies sought to portray it. Rather, Oettinger's increasing loss of party support in BW compelled Merkel to push Oettinger out to protect her support base there.  Oettinger is noted for a lackluster public speaking style, and some commentators have asserted that Merkel, who has often stood out at EU meetings, wanted to appoint a German Commissioner who would not outshine her.  2. (SBU) Germany has a time-honored tradition of sending unwanted politicians to the EU Commission, although departing SPD EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen proved his worth during his tenure.  Oettinger has criticized Merkel for her policy stances (on federal support to Opel and on generous subsidies to the former eastern states, for instance)  and her purported lack of leadership while antagonizing other influential CDU leaders.  In addition to being a poor public speaker, he has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth.  The best-known example was his ill-advised 2007 defense of a CDU predecessor as an opponent of the National Socialist regime, despite his documented pro-Nazi war record.  Nonetheless, Oettinger is said by industry sources in Baden-Wuerttemberg to be an efficient behind-the-scenes negotiator. 3. (U) Merkel was criticized for choosing the energy portfolio, which many derided as too insignificant for Germany.  Werner Langen, CDU/CSU caucus spokesman in the EU Parliament, said the portfolio has "lost significance." Prominent Green Member of the European Parliament, Reinhard Buetikofer characterized it as "not particularly influential," and Der Spiegel called it a "makeshift job."  The EU Energy Commissioner is responsible for issues such as supply security, energy R and efficiency, competition in the gas and electricity markets, infrastructure and low carbon technologies.  However, key issues such as energy security and climate change are not in the portfolio; nor will Oettinger take over the role of EU Commission Vice President from Verheugen. 4. (U) Oettinger has an academic background in law and economics and professional experience as a tax consultant and accountant.  His political expertise is in media policy.  His background in energy appears limited to public support for nuclear power and the extension of power plant operating licenses.  His pro-nuclear stance is in stark contrast to many other German politicians, who support the phase out of nuclear power.  This endears him to the EU, which is focused on diversification of energy sources and does not exclude nuclear energy.  Nuclear power plants supply most of BW's energy while renewable energy and fossil fuels do not play a significant role.  Oettinger has not expressed interest to date in energy issues other than nuclear.  His priorities in his list submitted to the EU Parliament in the run up to the January hearings of the candidate Commission are reportedly vague.  5.  (SBU) Parliamentarians, skeptical of several members of the new Commission, are likely to display particular interest in Oettinger's views on binding energy efficiency targets and encouraging more competition in internal energy markets. Although Germany has embraced a controversial domestic goal of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, it has yet to translate the EU energy efficiency directive into national law.  Germany has also steadfastly opposed liberalization of its power sector oligopoly (what Brussels calls "unbundling") although individual German companies are slowly moving in that direction.  Oettinger's stance on the internal energy market will also be of particular interest to European parliamentarians, who see France, and particularly French power giant EdF, as a major barrier to opening up the market. EdF is a major share-holder in BW regional energy supplier ENBW, which operates the state's nuclear power plants -- and with which Oettinger is known to have warm relations.   DELAWIE

REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D).   1. (C) SUMMARY.  The sudden resignation of Economics Minister Michael Glos (CSU) on February 7 caught Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her party off guard at a time when addressing Germany's economic downturn is paramount.  To minimize damage, the CSU quickly replaced Glos with its Secretary General Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a decision which continues to draw criticism from other parties as well as from within the CDU due to thirty-seven-year-old,s minimal background in economic policy.  The shuffle reveals strains between the CDU and CSU, and presents an opportunity for Merkel's political foes to portray her as lacking control as the country tries to deal with its worst economic crisis since World War II.  END SUMMARY.  INITIAL CONFUSION OVER RESIGNATION ----------------------------------  2. (C) Citing his age and intention to leave the cabinet after the September 2009 elections, the sixty-four-year-old Glos submitted his resignation as Minister for Economics and Technology on February 7.  Chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Bavarian Minister President Horst Seehofer named Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, 37, as his successor.  Zu Guttenberg had been CSU Secretary General for only three months following a major party reshuffle.  Glos explained his departure would allow the CSU to campaign with a new minister in place, and help restore trust in the CSU following its poor showing in the Bavarian regional elections in September 2008.  The timing of his departure -- during the financial and economic crises -- however, was awkward.  In addition, Glos submitted his resignation to Seehofer instead of Merkel, which the media has portrayed as a snub to the Chancellor.  (NOTE: Bavarian political reactions to be reported in ConGen Munich SEPTEL.)  ENTER THE YOUNG TURK --------------------  3. (SBU) Under pressure to resolve an apparent power vacuum at a key ministry, Seehofer, who as CSU Party Chairman had the right to fill the slot, had to find a replacement for Glos quickly.  At a February 9 press conference announcing the choice of zu Guttenberg, Seehofer said that he chose the rising CSU star partly in order to have a minister representing the northern region of Bavaria.  He lauded zu Guttenberg's international contacts and his presumed ability to promote German exports.  Seehofer denied reports that before accepting the new post, zu Guttenberg had demanded the high-level position of CSU Bundestag Spokesman and CDU/CSU Caucus Chief in case the CDU/CSU lost the September elections.  For his part, zu Guttenberg welcomed the opportunity to take on the economics portfolio.  He described Germany's "social market economy" as the "guiding principle" of his economic thinking, and underscored the importance of free trade.  Zu Guttenberg also said he would work to lower taxes for small- and medium-sized companies.   GLOS'S ROUGH RIDE -----------------  4. (C) Glos had always been an awkward fit for the Economics Ministry job, which he took on in November 2005.  Glos did bring intimate knowledge of federal politics to the job, but was not an economist and had never shown strong interest in the Economics Ministry's portfolio.  Chancellor Merkel instinctively turned to her Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck (SPD) to coordinate the response to the financial crisis, sidelining Glos.  Glos's inability to overcome CDU and SPD objectives and get additional tax cuts into the stimulus plan may have cost the CSU the recent Bavarian elections, to the dismay of Seehofer and others in the CSU.  5. (C) A devastating profile of Glos a few months ago in "Der Spiegel," whose main points Ministry contacts did not contadict, portrayed him as weak, out of touch with the bureaucracy, bored with his job, and looking forward to a nice sinecure for himself after retirement.  In a farewell  BERLIN 00000168  002.2 OF 002   meeting with former Ambassador Timken in late November 2008, Glos appeared under great strain and confessed to tremendous frustration over his inability to influence Merkel on tax cuts as part of the stimulus package.  NO LOVE LOST ------------  6. (C) SPD party stalwarts are giddy over perceived turmoil in the CSU and the perception that Merkel is not in control of developments.  Chancellor-candidate Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) said the CDU/CSU lacked "orientation" in their management of the economic crisis and called for "party order and discipline."  A CDU staffer expressed irritation over Seehofer's handling of the shuffle, but she shed no tears over Glos's departure.  On zu Guttenberg, FDP economics expert Rainer Bruederle commented to us that "as far as economics is concerned, it seems to be enough these days for the CSU to find someone who can read and write."  7. (C) The business community has mixed views.  An IBM lobbyist told Econoff that she regarded Glos as the only "counterweight to Steinbrueck" on economic policymaking in the Germany government.  A contact from the German industry association (BDI) conceded that Glos was "not the strongest Minister in the Cabinet," adding that BDI had often wished for someone in the position who was "more outspoken."  On zu Guttenberg, he conceded the new Minister was well-versed in foreign policy and transatlantic issues, though young and inexperienced.  COMMENT -------  8. (C) Glos's resignation caught the CDU/CSU party hierarchy off-guard at a time when everyone in Berlin and Munich was concentrating on the Munich Security Conference.  This high-profile resignation opens the door to criticism of Merkel,s handling of the economic and financial crises, as well as Seehofer's leadership style.  Zu Guttenberg's first challenge will be to help resolve the debate between the CDU/CSU and SPD over the stimulus package.  His appointment has been heavily criticized within the CDU, with some calling him a mere "place holder" until the September elections, raising questions about Merkel,s ability to steer her party effectively through a long  election year. If not addressed, the SPD and the opposition FDP could emerge strengthened by the affair, which has come at a very inopportune time for Chancellor Merkel,s CDU and its sister party, the CSU.

KOENIG  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2034 TAGS: GM MARR NATO PGOV PHUM PRELSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S BILATERAL MEETING WITH CHANCELLOR MERKEL ON THE MARGINS OF THE NATO SUMMIT  BERLIN 00000345  001.2 OF 002   Classified By: Charge d'Affaires John M. Koenig for reasons 1.4 (b) and  (d)   1.  (S/NF) Chancellor Merkel will be focused on a productive, substantive meeting when you visit Baden-Baden April 3. Germany holds the greatest untapped potential in Europe for our transatlantic agenda; unlocking it will take sustained effort by the Administration, and the payoff will not be immediate.  What is most on Merkel,s mind is her political future, six months before national elections, with her poll numbers wobbling and her coalition increasingly dysfunctional.  Germany,s capacity to act is constrained by (1) the short-term demands of domestic politics (about which we can do little), (2) the slow pace of change in public support for a German leadership role (a focus of our engagement), and (3) the constant demands of the economic crisis.  Your meeting provides an opportunity to map out key priorities with Germany for the remainder of Merkel,s current term and beyond.  --------------------------------- Merkel,s Own Crisis -- Leadership ---------------------------------  2.  (S/NF) Merkel is methodical, rational, and pragmatic -- qualities that propelled her to stratospheric levels of public support early in her tenure, when she presided over a recovering economy and a successful presidency of the European Union.  The past year has been less kind, and the almost exactly equal split in the German electorate between left and right is re-emerging as elections approach.  Merkel now faces a  knot8 of rising unemployment, economic crisis, and domestic political dissatisfaction at a time when she can least afford a wrong move.  The effectiveness of Merkel,s  Coalition8 government is declining as her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Social Democratic (SPD) partners begin in earnest their campaigns for the September 2009 election.  The Chancellor,s edge over the rival SPD, led by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is diminishing.  When cornered, Merkel can be tenacious but is risk averse and rarely creative.  This suggests she will remain a very circumspect Ally until the election.  3.  (C/NF) The collapse of German exports and industrial activity has shocked Chancellor Merkel and her advisors. They had thought Germany would escape the worst of the world recession thanks to its competitive position in emerging markets.  In the New Year, Merkel and Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck (SPD) rushed a relatively robust stimulus program through the Bundestag that is timed to counter a surge in unemployment just before the September elections.  Like most Germans, they doubt further deficit spending will generate lasting growth, and fear too large a stimulus may cause stagflation at home and dangerous new global imbalances. Merkel and Steinbrueck remain bitter at the brush-off they allegedly received during the last administration when they advocated tighter financial oversight.  Tougher regulations, they insist, are essential to restore confidence in the banking system and get credit flowing again, thus creating the pre-conditions for a sustainable recovery.  4.  (C/NF) Hoping to escape responsibility for the economic crisis, Merkel has issued public critiques of U.S. recovery policy that exaggerate the differences between Washington and continental Europe.  In fact, Germany faces many of the same difficult choices as the U.S.  The Chancellor is expected to put forward a further stimulus package later this year.  Her government has bailed out big banks while holding firm on state aid to ailing firms like Opel.  The conventional wisdom in Germany is that Opel could be rescued with minimum state aid if only it could be separated from GM, but in fact there is no viable business plan for the firm to stand on its own. The Chancellor is surrounded by bad options:  an interventionist approach would further alienate economic conservatives in her CDU (who are already defecting in droves to the free-market FDP); if she does nothing, Steinmeier and the SPD will harvest the goodwill of centrist voters for trying to save Opel.  Merkel has not been above shifting responsibility to the USG and General Motors, which she and  BERLIN 00000345  002.2 OF 002   the German media unfairly blame for bleeding Opel dry.  In the end, Merkel,s government will likely be forced to prop up at least parts of the automaker.  -------------------------------------------- Increasing Political Caution during Campaign --------------------------------------------  5.  (S/NF) Merkel and Steinmeier are pragmatists; on foreign policy, in particular, there is more that unites them than divides them.  But the centrifugal forces of the election campaign and the growing mistrust between the CDU and SPD make it increasingly difficult for them to agree on any big ideas about Germany,s role in the world or its relations with the United States.  Buffeted by events, Merkel is struggling to define a convincing vision for  Germany;  is the sole component at this point.  She is blessed that Steinmeier, her principal competitor, faces even greater difficulties.  His party has lost its bearings in the Grand Coalition and is plagued by internal divisions. Steinmeier himself is a technocrat and a latecomer to electoral politics -- his shortcomings on stage are significant.  Steinmeier has tried to make up ground on Merkel by publicly identifying himself with the new U.S. Administration.  However, his ability to deliver on policy initiatives without the Chancellor,s political support is limited.  6.  (C/NF) Afghanistan is an example.  Merkel has been cautious throughout her chancellorship and has doggedly resisted real or perceived pressure for Germany to take on a larger military role.  She and Steinmeier both have supported the Comprehensive Approach, but the Chancellor,s CDU, in the face of public skepticism, is reluctant even to consider increasing police or civilian support.  Steinmeier and the SPD have been more forward-leaning, but they cannot deliver on their own.  You should emphasize that at the moment the U.S. is not seeking significant additional military forces from Germany, but that every member of the international community will need to do much more (e.g., training security forces and providing civilian assistance) if we are to be successful.  --------------------------------------- Policy Opportunities on Russia and Iran ---------------------------------------  7.  (C/NF) Germany should play a central role with the U.S. in defining a coordinated western Russia policy that resets the relationship without retreating from our values.  The winter gas crisis made Germans rethink Russia,s reliability as a supplier, but the lack of alternatives and the desirability of gas as a clean energy source have left the government resigned to dependency on Russia in the near-to-medium term.  On energy as well as Georgia, neither Merkel nor Steinmeier has identified areas where German policy steps could help create a more persuasive set of incentives for Russia to integrate further into rules-based relationships and institutions.  Meanwhile, Germany is concerned about threats to economic and social stability in Central and Eastern Europe, but prefers EU and IMF approaches to limit its share of the bill.  8.  (C/NF) Both Merkel and Steinmeier welcomed your Nowruz address to the Iranian people and government.  They support the U.S. investment in the diplomatic track and agree that Germany and the EU need to invest in the economic pressure track.  Germany,s close ties to Israel include an imperative to defend Israel,s right to exist and to play an active role in international non-proliferation efforts toward Iran. Merkel will be looking to the meeting to gain a better understanding of how you see the USG Iran policy unfolding and what role we need Germany to play.  9.  (U) Mr. President, Mission Germany is honored to support you on your first overseas trip as President, and we look forward to welcoming you in Baden-Baden. Koenig

(C) Summary:  During a meeting with the Ambassador February 13, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yannian ridiculed the idea, but did not deny categorically, that China would provide Kyrgyzstan a $3 billion financial package in return for closing Manas Air Base.  Zhang said Kyrgyzstan was in Russia's sphere of influence, and China had only commercial interests here.  He also complained bitterly about Chinese Guantanamo detainees being shipped to Germany instead of China.  Zhang was very interested in whether the U.S. would negotiate to keep Manas, and he advised just giving the Kyrgyz $150 million a year for the Base.  "This is all about money," he said.  End Summary.  LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK RUSSIAN  2. (C) Ambassador met February 13 with Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Zhang Yannian.  After opening pleasantries, the Ambassador mentioned that Kyrgyz officials had told her  that China had offered a $3 billion financial package to close Manas Air Base and asked for the Ambassador's reaction to such an allegation.  Visibly flustered, Zhang temporarily lost the ability to speak Russian and began spluttering in Chinese to the silent aide diligently taking notes right behind him.  Once he had recovered the power of Russian speech, he inveighed against such a calumny, claiming that such an idea was impossible, China was a staunch opponent of terrorism, and China's attitude toward Kyrgyzstan's decision to close Manas was one of "respect and understanding."  3. (C) Composing himself, Zhang inquired if maybe the Kyrgyz had meant the trade turnover between the two countries, which he claimed was about $3 billion a year.  When disabused of that notion, Zhang went on at length to explain that China could not afford a $3 billion loan and aid package.  "It would take $3 from every Chinese person" to pay for it.  "If our people found out, there'd be a revolution," he said.  "We have 200 million people unemployed" because of the downturn in exports, he said, and millions of disabled and others who need help from the government.  A SLAP IN THE FACE  4. (C) When the Ambassador asked whether he would categorically deny what the Kyrgyz officials had told her about a deal with China, Zhang snapped that "releasing 17 from Guantanamo is an unfriendly act toward us."  He then went on at length about what a "slap in the face" it was to China that the Uighur detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to Germany, where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status. While not stating a tit-for-tat reaction on Manas, he did imply that the Guantanamo situation had made China look for ways to hit back at the U.S.  When the Ambassador inquired if maybe the Chinese were favorably disposed toward closing Manas because of their SCO membership, Zhang acknowledged that the SCO had pronounced for closing Manas, but claimed that "that was years ago and nothing has happened since."  He denied that the SCO was pressuring the Kyrgyz to close Manas.   RUSSIA: A GIFT FROM GOD FOR THE KYRGYZ  5. (C) The Ambassador then asked what Zhang thought about the $2 billion plus Russian deal with Kyrgyzstan.  After some hemming and hawing, Zhang said it was "probably true" that  BISHKEK 00000135  002.2 OF 002   the Russian assistance was tied to closing Manas.  Asked if he had any concerns about the Kyrgyz Republic falling ever deeper into the Russian sphere of influence and whether China had any interest in countering this, he answered that Kyrgyzstan was already in that sphere, and China had no interest in balancing that influence.  "Kyrgyzstan is Russia's neighbor," he intoned (somewhat expansively, since Kyrgyzstan does not share a border with the Russian Federation -- though it does share a border with China). "And when the Kyrgyz ask me about this, I always tell them that a neighbor is a gift from God."  As for China's interests in the Kyrgyz Republic, he stated flatly:  "We have only commercial interests here.  We want to increase investment and trade.  We have no interest in politics."  He claimed that some Kyrgyz had argued for China to open a base in Kyrgyzstan to counterbalance Russian and American influence in the country, but China has no interest in a base.  "We want no military or political advantage. Therefore, we wouldn't pay $3 billion for Manas," he argued.  PERSONAL ADVICE: PAY THEM $150 MILLION  6. (C) Zhang asked the Ambassador whether the U.S. would negotiate to keep the Base open.  The Ambassador answered that the U.S. side was evaluating its options.  Zhang then offered his "personal advice,"  "This is all about money," he said.  He understood from the Kyrgyz that they needed $150 million.  The Ambassador explained that the U.S. does provide $150 million in assistance to Kyrgyzstan each year, including numerous assistance programs.  Zhang suggested that the U.S. should scrap its assistance programs.  "Just give them $150 million in cash" per year, and "you will have the Base forever."  Very uncharacteristically, the silent young aide then jumped in: "Or maybe you should give them $5 billion and buy both us and the Russians out."  The aide then withered under the Ambassador's horrified stare.  7. (C) Commenting on the recent diplomatic corps lunch (Ref B), Zhang noted that Russian Ambassador Vlasov had been in an expansive mood and dominated portions of the meeting.  "I think that's when he found out that they'd reached a deal" with Bakiyev to close the Base, he opined.  Zhang, who is doyen of the diplomatic corps, said he would be leaving Bishkek soon, but did not yet know his next assignment.  "In our service," he said, "we don't know our postings until the last minute."  Comment -------  8. (C) Zhang was clearly flustered when confronted with the claims of Kyrgyz officials that they were negotiating a financial deal with China in return for closing the Base. While he ridiculed the notion of such a deal, he did not deny it outright.  Perhaps because of his being discomposed, he returned several times to the topic of a possible revolution in China if the economic picture does not improve and work is not found for the millions of unemployed there.  In our experience, talk of revolution at home is taboo for Chinese diplomats.  While candid at times, the meeting ended on a very cordial note. GFOELLER

(S//NF) SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  During a March 2-3 visit to Brussels, Daniel Glaser, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, assured an uncertain European Union that the United States remains committed to the dual track approach to Iran and said we would welcome additional EU designations targeting Iran's proliferation and sanctions evasion activities.  Delivering an unprecedented classified briefing to over 70 Middle East and nonproliferation experts from all 27 EU states and institutions, Glaser encouraged the EU to move forward on specific designations to support the current international framework targeting Iran's illicit conduct through financial measures.  2.  (C) EU Member States and officials uniformly praised the U.S. information-sharing on sanctions and the U.S. policy review.  Capturing the predominant sentiment, the Czech Presidency expressed gratitude for AA/S Glaser's presentation and confirmation that further EU measures "would be consistent with the U.S. policy review" as a signal the EU "are all waiting for, as this plays an important role in EU considerations."  However, some EUMS were uncertain whether they should move forward on pending designations before the completion of the policy review.  During the briefing and on its margins, member states' concerns emerged over national economic interests, unintended consequences (e.g., hurting average Iranians, sanctions efficacy, Iran's regional role, lawsuits, and international unity).  Glaser's separate consultations with representatives from the Council Secretariat and Commission, and Ambassadors of the Czech Republic (Presidency), UK, France, Germany, Spain, and incoming EU-Presidency Sweden are reported septel.  3.  (C) The content, tone, and timing of AA/S Glaser's briefing impressed an appreciative EU audience as a sign of the new U.S. Administration's seriousness about engagement with Europe.  The EU is predisposed to respond positively to the new Administration's policy on Iran and wants its views taken into account during the policy review stage. Glaser's presentation kept the good feelings going, but also helped bring EU experts down to earth in terms of specific tasks on which the EU could usefully focus now.  We hope the briefing provides a basis for further USG lobbying in individual EU Member States in capitals on pending EU designations.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  ------------------------------- U.S. Message:  EU Should Act -- 2009 The Critical Year -------------------------------  4.  (S) On March 3, the Czech EU Presidency convened a formal meeting of the EU-27 Iran and non-proliferation experts (COMOG/CONOP) to receive a classified briefing from a U.S. interagency delegation led by AA/S Glaser on measures in the financial and transport sectors to counter Iran's illicit conduct.  The session lasted a little over an hour (40 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of Q/A).  Given intense EU interest and in order to set the political context for the detailed technical briefing on specific U.S. designations that followed, AA/S Glaser  noted that the U.S. policy review on Iran had not yet finalized, but it was already clear that  BRUSSELS 00000536  002 OF 004   the USG would remain committed to a dual track approach to resolving the nuclear issue.  Consequently, the United States would welcome EU actions now to reinforce existing UNSCRs. The EU should act quickly to designate additional high priority proliferation targets.  5.  (S) To be sure, "engagement" would be an important aspect of a comprehensive strategy to dissuade Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.  However, "engagement" alone is unlikely to succeed. Diplomacy's best chance of success requires all elements combining pressure and incentives to work simultaneously, not sequentially.  Our shared challenge is to work together in finding the right mix of measures.  Time was not on our side.  The international community must urgently choose between several bad options facing us in 2009; none of these options were without cost.  Glaser pointed out that the dynamic nature of the international financial system required that targeted financial sanctions against Iran must be continually adjusted to maintain, let alone increase, pressure on Iran.  Over time, targeted Iranian entities were finding ways to evade sanctions via front companies and facilitators.  Without continuous active management on the part of the international community, the measures taken thus far would be rendered merely symbolic gestures.  6.   (S) Glaser stated that the EU had an important, but time-sensitive, opportunity to help diplomacy succeed by targeting illicit Iranian conduct that contravened UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). The international framework for moving forward was already in place, under the auspices of the UNSCRs and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). ; we should continue to support and operate within this framework.  Glaser urged the EU not to Underestimate its influence on the actions of other key countries and regions.  Priority Designation Targets -----------------------------  7.  (S) AA/S Glaser's formal presentation provided U.S. views and specific intelligence on financial and transport entities under active EU consideration for designation, including Bank Mellat, the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI), Bank Saderat, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL), and Iran Air (the only entity not yet U.S.-designated, which AA/S Glaser explained remains a potential target). Separately, several EU contacts found our case against Bank Mellat, EDBI and shipping companies to be particularly well formulated.  ---------------------- EU Audience, Reactions ----------------------  8.  (C) All 27 EU Member States (EUMS) attended the Czech Presidency-hosted classified briefing on March 3 in Brussels.  Indicative of the EU's high level of interest, all but Slovakia sent their capitals-based nonproliferation working group ("CONOP") technical expert in addition to their Middle East regional expert (mixture of capitals- and Brussels-based).  This was the first time the USG was welcomed to address this combined EU expert working group, which meets ad hoc to decide on revising EU nonproliferation measures against Iran.  Permanent institutional staff covering Iran, sanctions, and nonproliferation attended from the EU's Commission and Council Secretariat.  The EU's Situation Center (SitCen), the community's intelligence coordination unit, also sent several representatives.  9.  (C) Capturing the main sentiment in the room, the Czech Presidency expressed gratitude for AA/S Glaser's presentation  BRUSSELS 00000536  003 OF 004   and confirmation that further EU measures "would be consistent with the U.S. policy review" as a signal the EU "are all waiting for, as this plays an important role in EU considerations."  The Czechs and several others noted that U.S. information-sharing was conducive to closer transatlantic cooperation on Iran policy, predicting this would directly influence internal EU debate on pending designations of entities and individuals supporting Iran's proliferation.  10.  (C) Betraying some smaller EU states' resentment of the EU-3 countries' (UK, France, Germany) prerogatives within the Council on Iran policy, Cyprus pointedly thanked the U.S. delegation for sharing information with the entire EU "so all can take an informed decision," rather than being asked to take action through a "leap of faith" when some EUMS have information but the rest do not.  "We also welcome that you are stressing the dual-track approach," Cyprus added. (Comment:  The Cypriot intervention notwithstanding, the Czechs took considerable risk just in hosting the U.S. presentation.  The EU remains prickly over direct U.S. participation in their internal discussions and processes, particularly after the bitter divides over Iraq.  The Czechs suffered some pushback prior to the event.  End Comment.) 11.  (C) At the conclusion of the briefing, a handful of smaller EUMS raised concerns routinely featured in the EU's ongoing internal debate over next steps.  (Note: The EU-3 and Italy refrained from speaking during the briefing in apparent deference to the rest of the membership who do not enjoy routine access to U.S. senior Iran policymakers.  End Note.)   Unintended Consequences? ------------------------  12.  (C) Poland, Cyprus, and Portugal asked about the impact of current sanctions against Iran on the elite, the broader population, and the deteriorating economy.  Is the U.S. concerned that further moves could trigger an anti-Western backlash?  Could we target political elites without victimizing or burdening the general population?  While expressing support for targeted measures, Portugal and Cyprus worried that strengthening sanctions before Iran's June presidential elections could prove counterproductive by radicalizing the electorate and leading to Ahmadinejad's re-election.  Cyprus flagged comments by Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi against sanctions and stressed that it want to encourage Iranian moderates.  Portugal asked whether the United States has considered Iran's role in the region, e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq, and the broader Middle East.  13.  (C) AA/S Glaser concurred that these are all important questions, but pointed out that the international community must choose among a set of bad options in a very compressed timeframe.  The international community must convey an urgent sense of seriousness -- both to Iran and to other interested regional stakeholders in order to change strategic calculations and maximize the chance of a diplomatic success.  By law, U.S sanctions target those engaged in illicit conduct, including proliferation and terrorist financing. Targeting the Iran's access to the international financial system offers the best chance of reducing harm to the average population.  14.  (C) As to the impact of sanctions, Glaser noted that disaggregating the effect of international sanctions and Iran's own disastrous economic policies would be nearly impossible.  Moreover, sanctions must be examined in the context of an overall policy approach and not in isolation. A more useful indicator is the perception of Iran's  BRUSSELS 00000536  004 OF 004   decision-makers, who view sanctions as problematic, raising business costs, and necessitating evasive behavior:  the elite are reacting as if sanctions are having an impact.  Russia and China? -----------------  15.  (C) The Netherlands asked for U.S. views on the roles of Russia and China.  Cyprus referenced the importance of P5 1 unity to ensure Iran did not circumvent sanctions and promote efficacy, adding "UN backing is the best way."  AA/S Glaser agreed, but argued that we were already required to implement existing UNSCRs.  This situation demanded a nimble response to changing conditions, including deceptive practices by designated entities.  The U.S. closely consults Russia and China, who must play their parts.  What Should the EU Do?  Will U.S. Answer the Mail? --------------------------------------------- -----  16.  (C) The Netherlands asked what the U.S. explicitly wanted from Europe in the diplomatic ("political") track, and whether we plan to respond to the Iranian President's earlier letters (to former President Bush).  AA/S Glaser referred the Dutch to State on matters of diplomacy.  On the sanctions front, he noted that the U.S. policy review should not be a reason for the EU to stop reviewing its existing sanctions for appropriate next steps.  Given the tight timeframe, it would be helpful for the EU to make similar designations to those already included under existing U.S. sanctions authorities.  The Saderat Problem -------------------  17.  (S//NF) In his presentation, AA/S Glaser noted UNSCR 1803 and EU Common Position identification of Saderat for proliferation concerns, but explained that our domestic designation falls under U.S. counter-terrorism authorities. Although not raised by Member States in the formal briefing, several EU contacts (UK, France, Germany, Council Secretariat and Czech Presidency) had raised concerns that the EU would not be able to act upon the U.S. basis for designation of Bank Saderat (support for terrorist activity).  The EU Common Position imposing measures against Iran is strictly limited to proliferation as a legal basis for inclusion on the list. Support for terrorist financing is not grounds for inclusion.  (Comment: As the additional U.S. information presented was exclusively limited to terrorist financing concerns, some EUMS are questioning whether a sufficient proliferation basis exists for Saderat's inclusion under EU Iran sanctions.  The EU does not/not yet have consensus to include Saderat in the next round.  End Comment.)  18.  (U) AA/S Glaser has cleared this message.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED  MURRAY .

CAIRO 1227      B. CAIRO 746  Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey per 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  Key Points:  -- (S/NF) During a June 29 meeting with CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus, Egyptian General Intelligence Service (EGIS) Chief Omar Soliman shared his views on Iraq, Iran, and ongoing efforts on Palestinian reconciliation.  -- (S/NF) On Iraq, Soliman assessed that Arab leaders were taking a "new position" on supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki following the Iranian elections and described Egypt's plans to increase cooperation with the Iraqi government.  -- (S/NF)  Soliman believed that the Iranian elections and Hezbollah's electoral defeat in Lebanon presented a "good opportunity" to reduce Iranian regional interference, including by improving Syria's relations with the Arab world.  -- (S/NF)  On Palestinian reconciliation, Soliman was pessimistic that an agreement would be reached, but promised that Egypt would "not give up" and would continue efforts to undermine Hamas, including by preventing money and guns from entering Gaza.  ---------------------------- Iraq: Extending an Arab Hand ----------------------------  2. (S/NF) Soliman said Arab countries were looking for ways to support Prime Minister Maliki during this "crucial time" for Iraq.  General Petraeus thanked Egypt for supporting the Iraqi government, including by nominating a new Ambassador to Iraq (ref A) and encouraging other Arab countries to "hold out a hand in friendship."  On President Mubarak's instructions, Soliman explained, Egypt plans to increase cooperation with Iraq on a wide variety of political, security, and economic issues.  3. (S/NF) Soliman assessed that Arab leaders were taking a "new position" on Iraq following the Iranian presidential elections.  He believed that Iranian leaders would "change their attitude" towards neighboring countries and "supporting terrorism" abroad, and would focus instead on domestic issues.  Iran cannot afford to "challenge the international community now," Soliman opined.  The challenge, Soliman explained, was to "bring Iraq back to the Arab world" and foster support for Maliki.  According to Soliman, President Mubarak told King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia "not to search for another man," but should instead accept Maliki as Iraq's leader and support him.  --------------------------------------------- Iran: Elections Present Opportunity for Arabs ---------------------------------------------  4. (S/NF) Soliman stressed that Egypt suffers from Iranian interference, through its Hezbollah and Hamas proxies, and its support for Egyptian groups like Jamaatt al-Islamiyya and the Muslim Brotherhood.  Egypt will confront the Iranian threat, he continued, by closely monitoring Iranian agents in Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and any Egyptian cells. Improving relations between Syria and the Arab world would also undermine Iran's regional influence.  Soliman noted "a little change" in Syria's attitude on engaging with the Arab world, adding that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia shared this view and planned to visit Damascus soon "to help change Syria's attitude."  5. (S/NF) Soliman anticipated that Hezbollah's recent defeat in the Lebanese parliamentary elections would force the group to "remain quiet for sometime" as they rebuild domestic support and counter the perception that Hezbollah is a "tool of outsiders." With Iran itself focusing on domestic issues, he continued, it was a "good time to make changes" in Lebanon and reduce Iran's influence.  Egypt will support a Saad Hariri government and the Lebanese army, Soliman emphasized.  6. (S/NF) Soliman said that Iran heeded Egypt's warning against meddling in domestic affairs (ref B) and supporting groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. He received a "very positive message" from Iran's intelligence chief indicating that Iran would not interfere in Egypt.  Egypt planned to "remain quiet inside Iran" for the time being, but would continue to recruit agents who "will do what we ask," if Iran insists on interfering in Egypt.  "We hope Iran will stop  CAIRO 00001349  002 OF 003   supporting Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and other cells" within Egypt Soliman said, "but if not - we are ready." Soliman said Iranian President Ahmadinejad wanted to attend the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) conference in Egypt July 11-16.  If he did attend, President Mubarak would meet with him and clearly explain that Iranian interference in "Arab issues" was unacceptable.  "We are ready for good relations with Iran," Soliman noted, but only if Iran ceased interfering and supporting terrorists in the region.  7. (S/NF) Because of domestic problems, Soliman believed that Iran would seek better relations with the Arab world and suspend its nuclear program for a period of time to avoid a "war."  He also anticipated Iran would try to strike more of a "balance" between supporting its Hezbollah and Hamas "tools" and trying to build better relations with the Arabs. Soliman expressed concern that Iranian influence in Iraq would spread after the re-deployment of U.S. troops out of Iraqi cities and the eventual drawdown.  General Petraeus noted that 130,000 U.S. troops remain and that the drawdown would be gradual.  He expressed confidence that Iranian influence could be contained if Arab countries moved aggressively to support Iraq.  ---------------------------------- Palestinian Reconciliation, Israel ----------------------------------  8. (S/NF) Soliman explained that Egypt's three primary objectives with the Palestinians were to maintain calm in Gaza, undermine Hamas, and build popular support for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  On Gaza, Soliman said Egypt worked closely with Israel to coordinate humanitarian assistance shipments and was encouraging the Israelis to allow more assistance into Gaza. Soliman said he was still seeking a "tahdiya" (calm) agreement between Hamas and Israel, but noted that Israel's lack of a Gaza strategy and desire to keep Hamas under pressure made any agreement difficult.  On undermining Hamas, Soliman said Egypt has "stopped" money and arms from entering Gaza.  "Hamas feels they are losing their capabilities," Soliman said, as they are unable to re-arm using the tunneling network under the Egypt-Gaza border.  The pressure, especially from Egypt's success at dismantling Hamas' funding mechanism, may render Hamas "more flexible" than before.  9. (S/NF) Palestinians must believe that Abbas is capable of securing a Palestinian state, Soliman stressed.  He noted recent positive developments in the West Bank, including improvements in the Palestinian security forces and the lifting of some Israeli roadblocks to facilitate commerce and movement.  He expressed concern, however, that continued settlement activity, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent "radical" speech, and insufficient economic development in Palestinian areas were undermining the chances for resuming peace negotiations.  Soliman added that President Mubarak may invite Nentanyahu and Abbas to Cairo if efforts to re-start negotiations became "blocked."  10. (S/NF) Soliman briefed General Petraeus on his efforts to facilitate Palestinian reconciliation.  Reconciliation remains elusive, he noted, as neither Hamas nor Fatah really want an agreement.  The Palestinian factions were currently in Cairo, he said, for discussions on releasing detainees. Talks were at an impasse, however, as Hamas had suspended reconciliation talks until Abbas released all Hamas detainees in the West Bank, which Soliman said Abbas would never accept.  Soliman also doubted that a reconciliation agreement would be reached by July 7 as Egypt previously announced, and anticipated that talks would be suspended for one-two months.  Despite the challenge and frustrations, Soliman promised that Egypt would "not give up" on Palestinian reconciliation.  "It is hard," he continued, "but I am always optimistic.  I consider myself a patient man, but I am loosing patience."  ------------------- Syria, Yemen, Afpak -------------------  11. (S/NF)  Soliman hoped Syria would improve its relationship with the Arab world and the U.S. and stop serving as "Iran's lifeline" in the region.  He also stressed that Syria must cooperate with Iraq to improve border security and stem the flow of foreign fighters.  Soliman also called on Syria to drop its insistence that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be solved before Syria will reach an agreement with Israel on the Golan Heights.  12. (S/NF) Soliman expressed concern over instability in  CAIRO 00001349  003 OF 003   Yemen and said Egypt was trying to help President Saleh, including by providing information on Iranian and Qatari support to the al-Houthi insurgents.  General Petraeus noted U.S. efforts to improve Yemen's capacity to combat extremists.  On Pakistan, General Petraeus said he was encouraged by the Pakistani military's operations in the Swat Valley and Northwest Frontier Province, including their focus on holding and rebuilding effected areas.  Soliman credited the Pakistani government for doing a better job of convincing people that extremists pose a real threat to Pakistani national security.  On Afghanistan, General Petraeus stressed the importance of arresting the downward spiral of violence and improving governance after the September 20 national elections.  13.  (U) General Petraeus cleared this cable. SCOBEY
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 CAIRO 000231  NOFORN SIPDIS  FOR THE SECRETARY FROM THE AMBASSADOR  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2019 TAGS: PREL KPAL EG IS QA IR SYSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR REQUESTED  EGYPTIAN FM ABOUL GHEIT MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY  Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  ------- Summary -------  1. (S/NF) Madame Secretary, Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit has been looking forward to meeting you since your nomination was first announced.  The Egyptian leadership, including President Mubarak, are encouraged by the Administration's immediate attention to the Middle East and your and the President's early outreach to them. Overall, the Egyptians believe they did not receive fair treatment from the previous Administration and hope to see improvements.  Aboul Gheit likely will explain Egypt's "soft power"--its ability to influence regional events without benefit of deep pockets. He likely will focus more on the strategic challenges of the region--the peace process and Iran--but may also address some pending bilateral matters.  He may ask for your support for Egypt to be part of an expanded G8 or G20 and press the candidacy of Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosny for Director General of UNESCO.  He may not raise human rights (specifically Ayman Nour), political reform, or democratization; but you should.  Aboul Gheit will want to discuss Gaza, including smuggling and counter-tunneling; Iran; and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  On Iraq and counter-terrorism, we and the Egyptians see largely eye-to-eye; intelligence cooperation is close and effective; and our military-to-military relationship is durable but stuck in a force-on-force mindset.  2. (S/NF) Summary continued:  Aboul Gheit is smart, urbane, with a tendency to lecture and to avoid discussing Egyptian failings with all-purpose recourse to Egyptian sovereign pride. However, because this is his first meeting with you and it is in Washington, he may be more inclined to listen. You should thank him for Egypt's continuing regional leadership, in particular regarding their efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, and press him for Egypt to continue to use their influence and good offices to achieve a permanent solution to intra-Palestinian infighting and conflict.  You should also stress the need for Egypt to more effectively insure that Hamas cannot rearm via smuggling across -- or tunneling under -- the border with Gaza.  Aboul Gheit will press for your attendance at the March 2 Gaza Donors Conference in Cairo, and may complain about unhelpful Qatari and Syrian behavior.  He will also want to explore US intentions towards Iran; President Mubarak told Senator Mitchell during his recent visit here that he did not oppose our talking with the Iranians, as long as "you don't believe a word they say."  End summary.  ------------------------ Respect and Appreciation ------------------------  3. (S/NF) In terms of regional affairs, Special Middle East Envoy Senator George Mitchell struck the right chord during his recent visit to Cairo when he told President Mubarak that he was here to "listen and hear your advice."  The Egyptians have long felt that, at best, we take them for granted; and at worst, we deliberately ignore their advice while trying to force our point of view on them.  You may wish to thank Aboul Gheit for the vital role Egypt played in bringing about a ceasefire in Gaza, and its efforts at making it last.  You should ask him what the current state of play is between Hamas and Fatah and have him describe Egypt's vision of the future for the Palestinians, both among their factions, and vis a vis Israel.  Note:  Although the Egyptians will react well to overtures of respect and appreciation, Egypt is very often a stubborn and recalcitrant ally.  In addition, Egypt's self-perception as the "indispensable Arab state" is contingent on Egyptian effectiveness on regional issues, including Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq.  ----------------------------------------- Egypt and the Israel-Palestinian Conflict -----------------------------------------  4. (S/NF) Although Aboul Gheit was never enthusiastic about the Annapolis Peace process, resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the primary strategic political goal for the Egyptians.  They are proud of their role as intermediary, well aware that they are perhaps the only player that can talk with us, the Israelis, and all Palestinian factions.  Mubarak hates Hamas, and considers them the same as Egypt's own Muslim Brotherhood, which he sees as his own most dangerous political threat.  Since the  CAIRO 00000231  002 OF 004   June 2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza, the Egyptians, under the leadership of intelligence chief Omar Soliman (the de facto national security advisor with direct responsibility for the Israeli-Palestinian account) have shifted their focus to intra-Palestinian reconciliation and establishment of the Hamas-Israel ceasefire.  Soliman brokered a half-year-long truce last year, which Hamas broke in December, leading to the Israeli invasion of Gaza.  He has recently re-started those efforts, with the goal of getting Hamas to agree to a year-long ceasefire, which should give the Egyptians space to bring about their political goal of Palestinian reconciliation under a technocratic, non-partisan government headed by President Mahmoud Abbas.  ---------------- Gaza and Tunnels ----------------  5. (S/NF) Smuggling through the Sinai Peninsula and into Gaza is an old and complicated problem for Egypt.  Egypt views a well-armed and powerful Hamas as a national security threat, a point driven home in dramatic fashion by the January 2008 border breach when Hamas bulldozed the old border fence and more than half a million Palestinians poured into Egypt, unchecked and hungry.  Since the closure of the Egypt-Gaza border following the June 2007 Gaza takeover by Hamas, most smuggling of consumer goods and weapons has gone underground.  The narrow corridor between Egypt and Gaza is as honey-combed with subterranean passageways as a gigantic ant colony.  6. (S/NF) Although it is not directly in Aboul Gheit's bailiwick, belonging more to the security and intelligence forces, nonetheless the issue of tunnels and rearming Hamas is the subject of intense scrutiny (by Israel and the Congress), and sensitivity (by the Egyptians).  Long criticized by Israel for "not doing enough" to halt arms smuggling via tunnels, the Egyptians have stopped complaining and started acting.  Egypt has increased efforts to counter arms smuggling by accelerating its $23 million FMF-funded tunnel detection program along the Egypt-Gaza border and requesting U.S. support to purchase four backscatter X-Ray machines to scan vehicles entering the Sinai for weapons and explosives (note Aboul Ghait may not be of this EGIS-originated request).  Egypt also continues to cooperate with Israel, especially via intelligence sharing, to prevent militants from Hamas and other extremist organizations from crossing the Gaza border, and on thwarting militant activity in Egypt. Egyptian efforts are all justified under President Mubarak's pledge that Egypt with "protect its borders."  7. (S/NF) Egypt will not take any action that could be perceived as collaboration in Israel's siege of Gaza, and they have been hyper-sensitive to any suggestion that foreigners are assisting them or overseeing their efforts to counter smuggling. Aboul Gheit publicly distanced Egypt from our January MOU with Israel to combat arms smuggling into Gaza, although he knew about it in advance and consulted with Secretary Rice and me about its contents.  The Egyptians do not want to be stuck holding the Gaza bag, and must be able to point the finger of blame at Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  At the same time, Egypt has withstood scathing and widespread criticism in the Arab world for refusing to open the Rafah border crossing to supply Gaza.  Even during the height of the December fighting, the Egyptians only sent medicine and medical supplies through the Rafah border; all other humanitarian goods went through the Israeli crossing at Kerem Shalom.  They likewise insist that Rafah will only reopen to handle Gazan travellers when the Gazan side is under PA control with EU observers according to the 2005 AMA.   8. (S/NF) Ultimately, Egypt believes that the only realistic and viable solution to erode Hamas' power and stop arms smuggling is the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza and the opening of Gaza's border to legitimate trade.  While in the short term we can best assist the Egyptians with technical know-how and training, long term counter smuggling success will depend on reducing the financial incentives to smuggling by providing the Sinai Bedouin with legitimate economic opportunities and by regularly opening the Gaza borders to trade, thereby reducing economic incentives to smuggle.  ---------------------------------- The March 2 Gaza Donors Conference ----------------------------------  9. (S/NF) President Mubarak told Senator Mitchell that he  CAIRO 00000231  003 OF 004   wanted to personally invite you to the March 2 Gaza Donors Conference in Cairo.  Aboul Gheit will press hard for you to accept this invitation.  He is keen to keep up the momentum on Gaza reconstruction and for Egypt to be seen as taking the lead in helping the Palestinians.  It is very important to him that this conference be at the ministerial level, and he will be disappointed if you are unable to accept.  ------------- Iraq and Iran -------------  10. (S/NF) President Mubarak enjoys recounting for visiting members of Congress how he warned former President Bush against invading Iraq, ending with, "I told you so!" and a wag of his finger.  In addition, there are Egyptian misgivings about Nuri Al-Maliki and Shia majority rule in Iraq.  Egypt therefore will need additional prodding to continue to take steps to help  rehabilitate Iraq into the greater Arab world.  You should ask Aboul Gheit when he plans to fully open the Egyptian embassy in Baghdad and exchange accredited ambassadors with Iraq (the first Egyptian ambassador to post-Saddam Iraq was assassinated).  As for Iran, Mubarak has a visceral hatred for the Islamic Republic, referring repeatedly to Iranians as "liars," and denouncing them for seeking to destabilize Egypt and the region.  He sees the Syrians and Qataris as sycophants to Tehran and liars themselves.  There is no doubt that Egypt sees Iran and its greatest long-term threat, both as it develops a nuclear capability and as it seeks to export its "Shia revolution." Nonetheless, Mubarak told Mitchell pointedly that he did not oppose the U.S. speaking to the Iranians, as long as we did not "believe a single word they say."  Aboul Gheit will be keen to hear your description of U.S. intentions towards Iran. In his conversation with Senator Mitchell, Aboul Gheit carefully noting he was speaking personally, expressed more interest into bringing the Syrians into negotiations again; President Mubarak was not enthusiastic about dealing with the Syrians at this time.  ------------------------ U.S. Assistance to Egypt ------------------------  11. (S/NF) The greatest Egyptian outrage a year ago -- Congressional conditioning of $100 million of U.S. assistance to Egypt -- may now be moot, according to our latest understanding of the state of play with the FY2009 appropriations language.  Beyond the issue of conditioning, the Egyptians resent the U.S. unilateral decision to cut ESF in half, from $415 million in FY-08 to $200 million in FY-09, a level which the Egyptians find embarrassing, not because they need the money (they say), but because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship.  In my view, it is important to the U.S. to continue an ESF program aimed at health, education, and poverty eradication to demonstrate concern for the Egyptian people as opposed to a strictly military assistance program. Egypt has also been unhappy with the use of these funds to support democracy in Egypt.  It would be useful if you could urge that Egypt accept the FY 2009 levels so that we can proceed to program funds to benefit Egypt, while promising to engage in a serious review of the conflicts that exist and a desire to resolve them as soon as possible.  12.  (S/NF) Concerning military assistance, the Egyptian political and military leadership feel that they have been "short changed" by our holding to an FMF level of $1.3 billion, (the same level for 30 years despite inflation), and which they contrast with increases to our military assistance to Israel.  Finally, Egypt seeks a higher profile in international financial circles (Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali was recently named Chairman of the IMF's policy-setting committee, the IMFC, the first from a developing country), and Aboul Gheit is likely to ask for your support to include Egypt in expanded G8 and G20 fora.   --------------------------------- Ayman Nour and Saad Eddin Ibrahim ---------------------------------  13.  (S/NF) Egypt's political leadership considers our public chastisement of their treatment of jailed former opposition Al Ghad party leader Ayman Nour as interfering with internal affairs and infringement on national sovereignty.  Mubarak takes this issue personally, and it makes him seethe when we raise it, particularly in public.  Aboul Gheit's view is that we have made Ayman Nour a freedom martyr, and a damaging (and  CAIRO 00000231  004 OF 004   distorting) prism through which we view our relationship with Egypt.  Much the same can be said about Saad Eddin Ibrahim, the outspoken political science professor and democracy activist who is in self-imposed exile in the U.S. because of spurious law suits brought against him for allegedly defaming Egypt.  In a negative development in late January, Egypt,s Attorney General-equivalent took action to advance the only criminal case pending against Ibrahim.  You should press Aboul Gheit hard on Nour and Ibrahim, and also urge the GOE to stop arresting other less prominent political activists. Nour's health is bad and he has served more than half his sentence; he deserves a humanitarian pardon. You may wish to lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns.  You might note that although you and the President want to improve the relationship, Egypt could take some steps to remove these very volatile issues from the agenda.  ------------ Farouq Hosny ------------  13. (S/NF) Egypt has mounted a full-scale international campaign to support the candidacy of Culture Minister Farouq Hosny for Director General of UNESCO.  The Arab League and the African Union have already publicly stated their commitment to Hosny, and the Egyptians believe they also have the support of several Europeans, notably the French.  Aboul Gheit will also seek US support -- or, at least, not to actively oppose -- the candidacy of Farouq Hosny as the next Director General of UNESCO.  The U.S. informed him last year that we could not support the candidacy and urged Egypt to put forward another name. Abould Gheit will argue Hosny's merits for facing down the Islamic extremists who want to narrow the space in Egypt for artistic expression.  U.S. objections have been to statements Hosny has made that "Israel had no culture. . .it stole cultural ideas from others and claimed them as its own" and other objectionable remarks.  If we plan to derail the Hosny candidacy, we must provide a credible alternate, preferably an Arab and/or Muslim. SCOBEY

Key Points:  - (S/NF) During an April 21 meeting with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, Egyptian General Intelligence Service Chief Omar Soliman explained that his overarching regional goal was combating radicalism, especially in Gaza, Iran, and Sudan.  - (S/NF) On Gaza, Soliman said Egypt must "confront" Iranian attempts to smuggle arms to Gaza and "stop" arms smuggling through Egyptian territory.  - (S/NF) Soliman shared his vision on Palestinian reconciliation and bringing the Palestinian Authority back to Gaza, saying "a Gaza in the hands of radicals will never be calm."  - (S/NF) On Iran, Soliman said Egypt was "succeeding" in preventing Iran from funneling financial support to Hamas through Egypt.  Soliman hoped that the U.S. could encourage Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and stop interfering in regional affairs, but cautioned that Iran "must pay a price" for its actions.  - (S/NF)  Egypt is "very concerned" with stability in Sudan, Soliman said, and was focusing efforts on convincing the Chadean and Sudanese presidents to stop supporting each others' insurgencies, supporting negotiations between factions in Darfur, and implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  "Egypt does not want a divided Sudan," Soliman stressed.  ---- Gaza ----  2.  (S/NF)  Soliman said radicalism was the "backbone" of regional security threats, adding that radicalism in Gaza posed a particularly serious threat to Egyptian national security.  Soliman said Egypt must "confront" Iranian attempts to smuggle arms to Gaza and stop arms smuggling through Egyptian territory.  "Egypt is circled by radicalism," he continued, expressing concern over instability in Sudan and Somalia as well.  Egypt's own successful campaign against radicalism in the 1990s provided a useful lesson in how to counteract extremist groups by reducing their ability to operate and raise funds, in additional to educating people on the dangers of extremism. Soliman noted that only the Muslim Brotherhood remained and the Egyptian government continued to "make it difficult" for them to operate.  3.  (S/NF) "We do not want incidents like Gaza to inflame public anger," Soliman said, adding that the Gaza conflict put "moderate (Arab) regimes" in a corner.  To prevent another outbreak of violence, Egypt is focusing on Palestinian reconciliation and a durable cease-fire between Hamas and Israel.  On reconciliation, Soliman explained, the ultimate goal was to return the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, as "Gaza in the hands of radicals will never be calm." The problem, however, is that the PA cannot return to Gaza without Hamas' acquiescence.  Soliman said the PA must return before the January 2010 Palestinian elections, or else Gazans would be afraid to vote for moderates.  4.  (S/NF) Stability in Gaza also depends on giving people a more "normal" life, Soliman continued, saying Israel must be convinced to regularly open the border crossings for legitimate commercial activity.  The current system - where Egypt informs Israel of a humanitarian shipment and Israel waits two days before accepting or rejecting the shipment for transfer to Gaza - does not adequately meet people's needs.  5.  (S/NF) On Palestinian reconciliation, Soliman said he expected the factions to return to Egypt on April 26 to discuss his proposal on establishing a high committee comprised of the various factions.  The committee would be responsible for preparing for the January 2010 elections, monitoring reconstruction, and reforming the security services in Gaza.  On reconstruction, the committee would issue licenses for companies eligible to participate on projects, but the PA would decide who receives the money for private and government contracts.  Arab governments would assist with reforming the security services and could base security assistance out of Egypt.  Soliman doubted that Hamas would agree to the high committee, but said it was important  CAIRO 00000746  002 OF 002   to keep Hamas and Fatah talking, so they would not resort to violence.  ----------------------- Iran, Counter Smuggling -----------------------  6. (S/NF) Iran is "very active in Egypt," Soliman said. Iranian financial support to Hamas amounted to $25 million a month, but he said Egypt was "succeeding" in preventing financial support from entering Gaza through Egypt.  Iran has tried several times to pay the salaries for the al-Qassam Battalions, but Egypt had succeeded in preventing the money from reaching Gaza.  Soliman said the Egyptian government had arrested a "big Hezbollah cell," which was Hezbollah's first attempt to stand up a cell within Egypt.  Iran was also trying to recruit support from the Sinai Bedouins, he claimed, in order to facilitate arms smuggling to Gaza.  So far, he continued, Egypt had successfully stopped Hamas from rearming.  Soliman noted that in six months, MOD will have completed the construction of a subterranean steel wall along the Egypt-Gaza border to prevent smuggling.  He warned, however, that people will find an alternative to the tunnels to smuggle arms, goods, people, and money.  Admiral Mullen expressed appreciation for Egypt's efforts to combat smuggling, adding that he hoped Egypt felt comfortable enough to ask for additional border security assistance at any time.  7.  (S/NF) Egypt has "started a confrontation with Hezbollah and Iran," Soliman stressed, and "we will not allow Iran to operate in Egypt."  Soliman said Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they interfere in Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran, adding that EGIS had already begun recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria.  Soliman hoped the U.S. would "not walk the same track as the Europeans" in regards to negotiating with Iran and warned against only focusing on one issue at time, like Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Iran must "pay the price" for its actions and not be allowed to interfere in regional affairs.  "If you want Egypt to cooperate with you on Iran, we will," Soliman added, "it would take a big burden off our shoulders."  ----- Sudan -----  8.  (S/NF) Egypt is very concerned with stability in Sudan, Soliman said, but asked for the U.S. to be "patient" with the Sudanese government and give Egypt time to help the Sudanese government deal with its problems.  He applauded the appointment of Special Envoy Gration and recent U.S. statements on Sudan.  Soliman said Egypt was focused on three areas for promoting stability in Sudan: 1) repairing the relationship between Chadean President Deby and Sudanese President Bashir and stopping their support for each others' insurgencies 2) supporting negotiations between the various factions in Darfur, and 3) implementing the CPA.  Soliman encouraged a larger role for French President Sarkozy in mediating between Chad and Sudan.  He said that Southern Sudan "feels no benefits from unity," and Egypt is trying to bridge the "physiological gap" between north and south itself by providing humanitarian assistance.  "Egypt does not want a divided Sudan," he stressed.  Admiral Mullen replied that Egypt's leadership on Sudan was critical and looked forward to increased cooperation between Egypt and Special Envoy Gration.  ------------------ Piracy and Somalia ------------------  9.  (S/NF) Admiral Mullen stressed that piracy was an international crime that needed an international solution, especially on support for trying captured pirates.  The U.S. did not want Somalia to become the next safe haven for al-Qaeda after Pakistan, he stressed.  Soliman replied that there were not enough ships in the region to provide adequate security against pirate attacks and recommended that the international community, through the UN Security Council, focus counter piracy efforts on the Somali shore.  10.  (U) Admiral Mullen did not have the opportunity to clear before his departure. SCOBEY
C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 000179  H PASS SIPDIS  DEPT FOR NEA/ELA, NEA/IR, NEA/IPA NSC FOR MCDERMOTT  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2019 TAGS: PHUM IAEA KPAL PGOV PREL PTER IR IS IZ TU SYSUBJECT: PRESIDENT ASAD AND CODEL CARDIN DISCUSS A NUCLEAR IRAN, PEACE PROCESS, TERRORISM, AND HUMAN RIGHTS  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Maura Connelly for reasons 1.4 (b) and  (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY: CODEL Cardin, in a February 18 meeting with President Bashar al-Asad, FM Muallim, Presidential Advisor for Political and Media Affairs Shaaban, and Ambassador to the U.S. Mustafa conveyed U.S. concerns regarding Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon, Syrian human rights abuses, the Israel-Syria peace process, upcoming Lebanese elections, and Syrian support for terrorism.  Senator Cardin encouraged the SARG to address these issues in order to lay the groundwork for a more productive future dialogue.  Asad argued Syria essentially shared the same position as the U.S. on the majority of these issues, but Syria's approach toward solving these problems was clearly different.  Asad said the U.S. needed to look at the larger regional political picture, as Syria did, if it truly wanted to find satisfactory resolutions.  On Iran, Asad maintained IAEA monitoring would ensure Iran's pursuit of nuclear power for civilian purposes only.  Regarding human rights, Asad stated Syria was making progress, but the CODEL needed to understand this issue in the larger context of Israel's aggression in Gaza, the suffering of Palestinian refugees, and terrorist attacks on Syria.  Asad rejected the notion that Syria facilitated the transit of foreign fighters into Iraq, pointedly asking the CODEL what interest would he have in doing so?  The upcoming elections in Lebanon, Asad surmised, would not change the composition of the government dramatically nor Syria's determination to continue the process of establishing a full diplomatic presence in Beirut.  On future Israel-Syria peace negotiations, Asad was more vague.  He offered no specifics on re-opening talks, but expressed Syria's desire for the process to continue with U.S. involvement.  Finally, in response to the CODEL's repeated concerns about Syrian support for Hamas and Hizballah, Asad remarked that these were democratically elected organizations in the Palestinian Authority and Lebanon; dealing with them was simply part of the reality of politics in the Middle East.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------- The Opening Gambit: Human Rights --------------------------------  2. (C) Following a warm exchange of pleasantries in which Senator Cardin thanked Asad for sending Imad Mustafa to the U.S. as Syria's Ambassador ("He's in our offices so much we've thought of charging him rent!"), Senator Cardin noted the CODEL had come to Syria for two major reasons: (1) As a fact-finding mission with an eye toward reinvigorating the Syria-Israel peace process; and (2) to learn more about the Iraqi refugee situation.  Senator Cardin added "there are new opportunities . . . The U.S. has a new president who wants to work" with countries in the region.  Regarding Syria, he said, "there are areas of major concern," one of them being Syria's human rights record.  Senator Cardin told Asad he could give specific examples of citizens jailed for their political views.  Asad responded, "we are a country in process of reform.  We aren't perfect.  You are talking about 12 people out of 20 million.  It's a process. We are moving forward, not fast, but methodically." (NOTE: Asad's mention of "12 people" refers to the 12 members of the Damascus Declaration National Council convicted in October 2008 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison. END NOTE).  3. (C) Asad admitted Syria had very strong security laws, but argued they were necessary to protect the nation.  The members of the Damascus Declaration had been convicted for their "contact with an individual in Lebanon who had invited the U.S. to attack Syria.  This is against our law."  Senator Cardin replied he realized this was a domestic issue; he was not asking Syria to be exactly like the U.S., but Syria should nonetheless adhere to widely accepted international standards.  Senator Cardin argued that "when the U.S. is challenged, you see it on the front page of the newspaper" and that such challenges were an important part of a national dialogue.  "You do not see this (freedom of expression) anywhere in the region," Asad chuckled in reply, "let's talk about Saudi Arabia."   4. (C) Widening the human rights conversation beyond the scope of Syrian prisoners of conscience, Asad admonished the CODEL for focusing on 12 individuals without taking into account half a million Palestinian refugees in Syria alone, and the continued suffering of people in Gaza.  "Human rights," Asad philosophized, "is related to the whole upgrading of society.  This will produce new laws."  In a final bid to put the subject of human rights to rest, Asad stated he was a popular president and that if he were working against his people, he would not enjoy such popularity. "Don't worry about human rights, we're moving forward," he said.  5. (C) Turning to conflict and reform in the region, Asad observed many societies in the region (including Syria) were experiencing a shift in political alignment to the right.  As a result, the process of political reform had become increasingly difficult.  Asad warned that countries, like Lebanon and Algeria, which had strived for rapid reform in the past, had only set the stage for more conflict.  In the case of Algeria during the 1980s, Islamists had tried to use a sudden political opening to gain power and this had sparked a conflict lasting twenty years.  Similarly, Asad continued, Lebanon's reform process and the May 29 elections had been the cause of the subsequent sectarian violence.  Asad contended the real issues were "peace and fighting terrorism."  ------------------------------- The Middle Game: A Nuclear Iran -------------------------------  6. (C) Senator Whitehouse raised Iran, agreeing with Senator Cardin's assessment of the new political terrain and asserting: "We have a moment of opportunity for new policies." Whitehouse cautioned Asad that it was also "a time for choices."  The manner in which the U.S. would proceed depended on "honest, sustained cooperation in the region," he said.  The senator emphasized the time-frame for this cooperation was quite short.  The one thing that could bring it to a premature close would be Iran's development of nuclear weapons. "If Iran insists," Senator Whitehorse stated, "it will create an atmosphere challenging for negotiations."  7. (C) Asad swiftly responded, "we're not convinced Iran is developing nuclear weapons."  He argued Iran could not use a nuclear weapon as a deterrent because nobody believed Iran would actually use it against Israel.  Asad noted an Iranian nuclear strike against Israel would result in massive Palestinian casualties, which Iran would never risk.  8. (C) Second, he continued, the IAEA had reported no evidence of a nuclear weapons program in Iran existed. Arguing Syria and the U.S. were actually closer than they realized on these issues, Asad said Syria adamantly opposed any "weapons of mass destruction" in the Middle East.  But as signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) both Iran and Syria had the right to pursue nuclear power for civilian purposes.  Asad asserted demands for Iran to "stop" its nuclear program were unproductive and a violation of its rights under the NPT.  Instead, he said, "the argument should be about how to monitor their program," as outlined in the NPT.  "Without this monitoring," Asad warned, "there will be confrontation, and it will be difficult for the whole region."  Asad leaned slightly forward and said: "Let's work together on this point."  9. (C) Senator Whitehorse replied, "I hope monitoring is enough," noting the difficulty of such a project in a closed society such as Iran.  Asad responded an international system for monitoring was in place and should be followed.  Senator Cardin interjected, "we believe Iran's goals are the opposite of what you describe.  We think they want to change the equation" (of power in the region).  Asad asked the CODEL to put aside this point of view and focus on monitoring. Senator Cardin said, "we agree on monitoring, but we think Iran  should give up its nuclear ambitions."  Asad reiterated monitoring was the best institutional way to control Iran's nuclear program.  Senator Wicker challenged Asad's assertion Iran was not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that monitoring alone would work. Asad replied his impression was that Iran's program was for peacful purposes with the caveat "we have no evidence as we are not in Iran."  Senator Wicker advised Asad the international community assessed otherwise; the question now was what the appropriate response to Iran should be.  "Everyone wants to avoid a military reaction," he noted, "but it was the clear view of the former administration and is the clear view of the current administration that something will have to be done."  Asad observed "you have my impression.  Everything you mention is guessing.  Monitoring will make everything clear."  10. (C) Representative Moore argued that while monitoring was a mechanism appropriate to "nation states," it would not be effective in controlling Iran's military proxies, Hamas and Hizballah.  She stated both Syria and Iran provided financial support to the two groups and there was no way to rule out categorically the possibility that Iran might provide nuclear material to Hizballah.  "The ability of the international community to monitor Iran on NPT is understood.  It's the role of the proxies that is the problem," she said.  Asad replied, "if you don't trust the mechanisms of the NPT, let's cancel it."  He maintained these proxies "would go away" if there was a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement.  He asked who had created these proxies?  "We didn't and Iran didn't.  How were they created?  By conflict because Lebanon was occupied by Israel.  It's normal to have resistance. This is the reality we have to deal with."  -------------------------- Testing The Flank: Lebanon --------------------------  11. (C) Senator Wicker asked Asad to give his prognosis for the upcoming Lebanese elections, the prospect of Syria sending an ambassador, and whether Hizballah would disarm. In a tone of resigned pessimism, Asad replied that the Lebanese elections would not make much of a difference.  In Lebanon, he explained, any party can get a "veto third." Asad maintained the key issue was whether the Lebanese would vote along political lines or sectarian lines.  If the latter occurred, then Shi'as would elect Shi'as, Christians would elect Christians, and so on, which would result in conflict. "If you don't have consensus, you will have civil war.  This is how it has always been in Lebanon," he said.  Conflict in Lebanon would preclude normal relations between the two countries.  12. (C) On the subject of a Syrian ambassador to Lebanon, Asad characterized the delayed appointment as being part of a deliberate political process.  Asad pointed out Syria had opened an embassy and staffed it, actions they would not have taken if they did not fully intend to send an ambassador. Asad argued an appointment like this was a political step requiring the proper timing.  He added "we know who and when, but we're not going to announce it today."  Senator Wicker deftly rejoined "we could make news!" eliciting laughter from everyone, including Asad.  13. (C) Regarding the disarmament of Hizballah, Asad argued "Hizballah has no specific interest in Israel besides securing Lebanon's borders and preventing threats to Lebanon's integrity, like Israel's daily violations of Lebanese airspace."  Asad noted Hizballah was the most powerful political party in Lebanon, was democratically elected, and if peace in the region were to be achieved, "the small things" with Hizballah and Hamas would disappear. "Let's talk about the peace.  This is the big picture that will solve everything."  Asad likened the U.S.'s approach to Hizballah to trying to patch an old suit when a new suit was needed.  Senator Cardin countered that peace would very likely go forward if Syria would stop the arms flow to Hizballah.  The senator noted many countries thought Syria was concerned about possible repercussions with Iran if it  were to take the initiative on stopping arms to Hizballah. Asad responded Syria had been in negotiations with Israel with no concern for Iran's opinion.  He told the story of how Iranian President Ahmedinejad called him just before the Annapolis conference and implored him not to send anyone, that it was a "bad meeting," but that they sent a representative anyway. "I told him I know it (Annapolis) is just a photo op.  But I am sending someone anyway.  We do what we think is good for our interests; it's not dependent on Iran," he contended.  ------------------------------ A New Tempo: The Peace Process ------------------------------  14. (S) Senator Tom Udall asked what message Asad wanted the CODEL to deliver to the new administration. Asad replied he saw two key common interests between Syria and the U.S.: peace in the region and combating terrorism.  Asad argued Syria had been at the forefront of fighting terrorism ever since it put down the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982.  He claimed that in the mid-1980s, Syria had sent a delegation to Europe to articulate the need for a coalition to fight terrorism, but nobody had listened.  Asad said Syria wanted to know when the U.S. would adopt a new approach toward terrorism, adding that "it's not a question of how much you can destroy, but how much dialogue you can make."  The Europeans, Asad continued, knew more about the region than the U.S. and he urged the CODEL to turn to them for guidance.  Asad stated the U.S. and Syria shared a common interest on "70 percent" of the issues at hand, the difference was all in "point of view, principles, culture, and approach."  Keen to press the topic of engagement, Asad attempted to refute the idea that a new dialogue would only make Syria stronger: "No, you make yourselves stronger because you have interests in the region."  15. (C) Agreeing that dialogue was crucial and an essential component of the Helsinki Commission, Senator Cardin advised Asad that if he were serious about engagement, he would expel Hamas leaders from Syria.  Asad replied, "What if Hamas supported peace?"  Senator Cardin explained Hamas was a symbol--it launched rockets into non-military areas and this was the definition of terrorism.  Asad replied Hamas was an uninvited guest; it was really the very Muslim Brotherhood organization Syria had combatted through the 1980s.  "If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties.  Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence." Senator Cardin pointed out not expelling Hamas sent a signal to the international community that Iran, given its support for Hamas, might be making the decisions in Damascus.  -------------------------------- En Passant: The DCS, ACC and ALC --------------------------------  16.  (C) When confronted with Senator Cardin's observation that the SARG's closure of the Damascus Community School (DCS), the American Culture Center (ACC), and the American Language Center (ALC) had hurt Syrians more than Americans, Asad assured the CODEL that this was merely a public relations gesture on his part.  "We were attacked by the U.S. army," Asad replied, "Seven civilians were killed.  I had two choices: fight the U.S. army or do something symbolic.  It's something temporary. You'll open it next year."  Senator Cardin told Asad he understood "symbolic gestures, but not when they hurt your own people."  ------------------------------ The End Game: Foreign Fighters ------------------------------  17. (C) "What interest does Syria have in letting foreign fighters go to Iraq?" Asad pointedly asked in response to Representative McIntyre's question about why Syria had not done more to monitor and staunch the flow of transiting fighters across the Syria-Iraq border.  Asad continued: "Can you stop the immigration of Mexicans into the U.S.? No. All  borders are porous.  There is no army on the border; you don't have soldiers on the border.  Do your homework.  My job is to protect my people, not your soldiers.  We have terrorists.  Two months ago there was a car bomb in Syria and that car came from Iraq." (NOTE: We assume Asad is referring to the September 27, 2008 car bomb attack against a SARG military facility, though Syrian Military Intelligence has reportedly stopped several cars rigged with explosives since then. END NOTE).  Asad noted that the lack of cooperation with military forces in Iraq contributed to the problem. With Turkey, he said, the border was more complicated and the terrain worse, but because Syria enjoyed better cooperation it was less porous.  18. (C) Asad recounted how when (then NEA A/S) William Burns and representatives from the Army and CIA came to Damascus, "we said we were ready to cooperate.  We took the delegation to the border, then after they left we waited for a proposal, but nothing came of it. They didn't want to cooperate."  Asad added Syria lacked the financial and technical means, such as night-vision goggles, to tighten its control of the area. Asad then said, somewhat contradicting himself, that 80 percent of controlling the border was about controlling the country. Representative McIntyre asked, "but are you willing to monitor (the border)?"  The president demurred, "this is a different problem," at which point Ambassador Mustafa interjected with "I will brief you on the details."  19. (C) The three main objectives Asad felt the U.S. and Syria should work on were (1) Eliminating WMD in the region; (2) pursuing a shared interest in a stable Iraq; and (3) working for peace and combating terrorism.  Asad re-affirmed that Syria was not an enemy of the U.S., "I have saved American lives." In 2002, Asad explained, he passed information to the King of Bahrain about an imminent attack on American citizens.  Ambassador Mustafa added that then Secretary of State Colin Powell had sent the Syrian government a letter expressing his gratitude for its assistance.  If the U.S. wished for similar coordination in the future, Syria could not begin security cooperation without concomitant political cooperation, Asad stated.  20. (C) COMMENT: Beginning with the visit of President Carter last December, President Asad's exposure to U.S. politicians has steadily increased.  This encounter was a good example of how Asad has been able to hone his responses to U.S. accusations that Syria is a bad actor in the region.  At no point in the conversation did Asad ask about the appointment of a U.S. ambassador to Syria or economic sanctions, which suggests to us that he is doing everything possible to avoid the appearance of being the supplicant, despite the Syrian press's heavy focus on Syria's desire to see an end to sanctions and the appointment of a U.S. ambassador.  21. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: We have heard anecdotally that Asad was not pleased with the tenor or substance of his meeting with the CODEL.  The SARG is reportedly interpreting the group's position on Iran, Iraq, Hizballah, and human rights to be a continuation of, rather than a departure from, the previous Administration's policy toward Syria.  We note that the CODEL's discussion with Asad was frank but cordial. Senator Cardin and the CODEL members aired U.S. policy concerns publicly from their perspective as elected legislators in press remarks, framed in the context of their desire to explore whether cooperation with Syria is viable. The Syrian press and many of our interlocutors have come to view re-engagement with the U.S. as a fait accompli, as something long-overdue and very much owed to Syria.  Asad's displeasure with the CODEL may be his first recognition that U.S.-Syria bilateral relations will require more on his end than originally anticipated.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DOHA 000502  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/2019 TAGS: PREL MASS QA XF ZP ZR YM IR JO LESUBJECT: ASD VERSHBOW'S MEETINGS IN QATAR  Classified By: Amb Joseph LeBaron for reason 1.4 (b) and (d)  (C) SUMMARY -------------  1.    (C)  During their July 20-21 visit to Qatar, Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for International Security Affairs, Ambassador Alexander Vershbow, and State Political-Military (PM) Assistant Secretary Andrew Shapiro held meetings with Qatar's military Chief of Staff, Major General (MG) Hamad al-Attiyah and the Crown Prince Tamim bin Hamad al Thani.  MG al-Attiyah and the Crown Prince tried to assure the Assistant Secretaries that Qatar used the Chief of Staff's visit to press Iran to respond to U.S. offers of engagement and to dismiss as "rubbish" Iranian efforts to blame the election crisis on U.S. and UK special services. The U.S. affirmed displeasure with Iranian behavior, and said the U.S. would not tolerate Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons.  ASD Vershbow suggested now was the time for Qatar to distance itself from Iran and its proxies and urge Iran to end its destabilizing behavior. 2.    (C) MG al Attiyah and the Crown Prince repeated the Qatari position that they felt the need to engage all their neighbors and that Qatar could perhaps influence Iranian behavior through its engagement.  MG al-Attiyah also expressed disappointment that the Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measure (LAIRCM) system is not available to be installed on Qatar's recently purchased C-17 aircraft.  ASD Vershbow said he would look into the issue further and that a formal response from the SecDef would be forthcoming.  The Chief of Staff also said no decision had been made on fulfilling an earlier U.S. request to provide funding for the refurbishment of Jordanian tanks being provided to Lebanon. When ASD Vershbow requested that Qatar use its good offices to help the U.S. in Yemen and induce a change in Hamas's behavior, the Chief of Staff expressed irritation that U.S.-Qatar friendship did not extend to issues of importance to Qatar, such as LAIRCM.  END SUMMARY  U.S.-QATAR RELATIONSHIP -----------------------  3. (C) U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for International Affairs Vershbow and Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Shapiro, joined by Ambassador, met July 20-21 over dinner and in a separate office call with Chief of Staff (COS) Major General Hamad al-Attiyah.  The U.S. visitors thanked the COS for Qatar's continued hospitality and support and for hosting our presence at both Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) and Al-Udeid Air Base (AUAB).  C-17 PURCHASE -------------  4. (C) BG General al-Malki (Commander of the Fighter Wing and Chairman of the Transport Committee) informed ASD Vershbow that the first C-17 was on schedule for delivery and would depart California on August 11 with an ETA at AUAB O/A August 15.  In addition, BG General al-Malki mentioned his disappointment at the delay of the pilot training program, which will further delay the aircraft from becoming operational.  In response, ASD Vershbow reassured him that USG would work to resolve the issue.  5. (C) COS al-Attiyah expressed his concern to ASD regarding the C-17 LAIRCM.  The COS stated that he was greatly disappointed over USG disapproval of Qatar's application for LAIRCM.  Al-Malki pointed out that other nations had acquired the system and that Qatar's exclusion added to his frustration.  The COS said he did not want to elevate the matter to Qatar's civilian leadership.  He believed that Qatar's leaders would question the benefits of the U.S.-Qatari military relationship if the concern were to be raised.  6. (C) ASD Vershbow responded that a letter would be forthcoming from SECDEF explaining that Qatar would be receiving the same aircraft as received by the United States Air Force (USAF).  Vershbow further clarified that the LAIRCM was an additional add-on, for which transfer to Qatar had been disapproved.  Vershbow recommended that Qatar pursue other options, noting he was unaware that other nations had access to the LAIRCM system for transport aircraft.  ASD Vershbow said he would look into the matter, adjust the SECDEF letter as necessary and respond formally to the GOQ. COS and al-Malki stressed Qatar's desire to use aircraft jointly with the U.S. and Coalition Forces.  IRAN ----  DOHA 00000502  002 OF 003    7. (C) ASD asked the COS to recount his visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran.  COS briefed that his first visit to Iran was short in duration.  The Qatari delegation praised President Obama's Cairo Speech while in Iran and urged the Iranians to take steps to avoid isolating themselves internationally.  Further, the Qataris suggested that the Iranians seek engagement and rapprochement.  ASD Vershbow said this was the right message, and those who have contacts with Iran should use every opportunity to persuade Iranian leaders to end their destabilizing behavior.  8. (C) ASD Vershbow reiterated the need for Iran to take steps to convince the international community that it was not pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, and to end its support for Hamas, Hizballah, and other extremist groups.    He said we understand why Qatar, because of its close proximity and its economic and political ties to Iran, felt the need to engage with Iran.  Qatar should help the Iranians to avoid a conflict with the U.S. and the international community, remarking that "friends do not let friends drive drunk."  9.  (C) COS al-Attiyah responded that while Iran expresses a desire privately to change its behavior, these could be meaningless platitudes.  The COS reiterated that the GOQ opposes any Iranian pursuit of a military nuclear capability, noting that it would destabilize the region.  COS further suggested that the USG continue its own dialogue with the Islamic Republic.  COS al-Attiyah closed the discussion by making clear that, with respect to Iran, "while we're neighbors, we're not friends."  He summed up his recent visit to Tehran as an overture to maintain open channels of communication with Iran.  LEBANON -------  10. (C) ASD asked if the GOQ had a response to an earlier request to the Prime Minister by Secretary Gates to help fund the transfer of 55 M1A1 tanks from Jordan to Lebanon.  COS said he was aware of the request, but that no decision had been made.  He added that he had discussed the issue during a recent CHOD conference with Jordanian and Lebanese representatives.  HAMAS -----  11. (C) ASD Vershbow raised Qatar's ties with Hamas, and told the COS that Hamas needs to be encouraged to rejoin the Palestinian Authority and the Peace Process.  He added that there should be "no blank checks, no checks at all," for Hamas.  ASD suggested that Qatar was in a position to influence Hamas; if Qatar helped bring about a change in Hamas's behavior, it could enhance the U.S.-Qatar strategic relationship.  COS undertook to relay that message to the Amir and Crown Prince.  While the COS underscored that Qatar wants a good relationship with the U.S., he noted there were times when USG decisions sent a different signal, such as the USG's decision on LAIRCM.  COS al-Attiyah rhetorically asked, "Are we friends or not?"  YEMEN -----  12. (C) ASD Vershbow asked if Qatar, or the GCC as a whole, would be renewing efforts to help solve the troubles in Yemen, citing Qatar's previous mediation efforts.  COS al-Attiyah responded that GOQ had engaged Yemen in the past, but noted that maintaining productive dialogue is difficult, given Yemen's economic plight and decentralized tribal society.  The COS added that the GOQ was unsure how Yemeni President Saleh plans to curtail the violence there.  He also noted that there is little military cooperation between the Qatar Armed Forces (QAF) and Yemen, but that he would make the GOQ leadership aware of the ASD's interest.  The COS said that the GCC had earlier presented a "unified package," but its efforts in Yemen had failed.  COS al-Attiyah recommended that this subject be addressed at the Manama Dialogue in December.  NSS and CIP -----------  13. (C) ASD commended the COS on the upcoming CENTCOM-GOQ-Naval War College effort to develop a National Security Strategy.  Qatar and others in the region need to place more emphasis on Critical Infrastructure Protection, added the ASD.  COS al-Attiyah agreed and said he was looking forward to this effort. (Note: OMC Qatar will escort an interagency Qatari delegation back to Tampa August 11-13 to  DOHA 00000502  003 OF 003   begin this process.)  CLOSING REMARKS ---------------  14. (C) COS ended the discussions by stating that he valued the U.S.-Qatar relationship.  The GOQ was committed to the friendship forged between the two nations, he said.  COS said he is looking forward to the P4 visit and expressed his desire to invite the P4 to his beach house as schedules permit.  COMMENT -------  15.  (C) Qatar clearly registered its disappointment in not receiving LAIRCM for its C-17.  We believe this could fester into an open wound in the vital U.S.-Qatar security relationship.  The Chief of Staff is particularly sensitive about the issue, since Qatar's senior leadership (the Amir and Crown Prince) holds him responsible for maintaining a close and productive U.S.-Qatar military relationship. However, given the Qatari leadership's perception of the Chief of Staff's inability so far to get LAIRCM, senior leadership may start to question the Chief of Staff's assurances about the strength of the U.S.-Qatar military relationship.

Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d).  -- Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman and Ambassador met December 10 with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (HBJ) to discuss energy research and development, critical infrastructure protection, and Iran.  -- HBJ indicated Qatar,s interest in a bilateral critical infrastructure protection partnership.  -- The PM was skeptical about the plausibility of Iranian acceptance of a nuclear compromise, saying he would be shocked if Iran abided by a deal to ship Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) out of Iran.  -- The best way to deal with the Iranians, he said, is to get them to dictate the terms of any such deal. The U.S. and its partners should strive to get the Iranians to put the details in writing, including timetables for implementation.  -- HBJ characterized Qatar,s relationship with Iran as one in which "they lie to us, and we lie to them."  -- According to HBJ, the GOQ tells Iran that it should "listen to the West,s proposal or there will be military action. If not by the U.S., then by the Israelis by the middle of next year."  End Key Points.  1. (C) Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman and Ambassador met December 10 with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. Also present on the American side was State Department Coordinator for International Energy Affairs, David Goldwyn.  DepSec Poneman thanked the Prime Minister for the meeting and expressed his hope that the U.S. and Qatar could strengthen their bilateral and investment ties.  -------------------------------------- (C) CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION --------------------------------------  2. (C) The Deputy Secretary extended USG appreciation to the Prime Minister for Qatar,s support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The PM observed in response that "We might have our own Katrina," an apparent reference to security concerns arising from Qatar,s relationship with Iran. Deputy Secretary offered U.S. help to Qatar in protecting its critical infrastructure and in addressing its broader security concerns. Expressing interest in critical infrastructure protection, HBJ said he would talk to the Ministries of Energy and Interior on how best to take advantage of U.S. assistance.  --------------------------------- SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT ---------------------------------  3. (C) The Deputy Secretary raised science and technology investment, noting DoE interest in partnering with the GOQ on energy-related research and development projects. As an example of possible cooperation, DepSec Poneman cited computer simulation, emphasizing that the DOE national laboratories are international leaders in the field.  4. (C) The Deputy Secretary reported that DoE had recently invested in a nanotechnology program and cited this as another possible area of cooperation, telling the PM there are additional opportunities for GOQ partnerships with private labs. Shaykh Hamad immediately expressed strong interest in nanotechnology, and asked the DepSec to provide him with a paper on that subject. The DepSec agreed, and added that he would be pleased to host Shaykh Hamad at the Sandia nanotechnology facility or another national lab.  5. (C) Turning to genomics and solar technology as they relate to food production and Qatar,s National Food Security Program, Shaykh Hamad told the Deputy Secretary that he supported research in those fields, but expressed his opinion that Qatar,s investment in food and solar technology must be done on a commercial basis.  -------------------------- (S) IRAN,S NUCLEAR PROGRAM ---------------------------  6. (S) DepSec Poneman asked HBJ for his views on Iran,s nuclear program. The Deputy Secretary noted that the USG had entered into recent discussions with Iran not out of naivet, but as an effort to address a humanitarian concern (the need for medical isotopes) while also attempting to remove a  meaningful amount of special nuclear material. Even though the effort had not to date resulted in Iranian agreement, it had borne fruit in the form of Russian and Chinese support for the most recent resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna. The PM expressed his skepticism that the West would be able to reach a deal with Iran,s leaders, saying "I,d be surprised and shocked if the Iranians do a deal. You always think you have a deal with them and then you don,t." He continued, "The EU, Chirac, and Solana...they all thought they had a deal... Solana said two weeks; I advised him it would take two years."  7. (S) Asked for his advice on how best to approach the Iranians, HBJ said it is imperative that the Iranians commit to draft any deal, including a timetable. He reiterated that it is important to "make them tell you (what they will do). Otherwise they will say 'yes, but...' and the 'but' will be worse than a 'no.'" The Deputy Secretary countered that, "They don,t want to make a proposal." To which HBJ responded, "You don,t understand. Even Mousavi can,t make a deal!" Poneman pressed the issue, saying the U.S. would not be offering a better deal than what is currently on the table. The Prime Minster said, "I know, but this is the way they are."  8. (S) Referring to the current proposal on the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), Deputy Secretary Poneman stressed: "This is a fleeting opportunity. If they don,t take this deal, what comes next is worse." The PM noted that the Iranians frequently press the Qataris to have dialogue on their shared natural gas field and attempt to expand the dialogue to include other subjects.  HBJ said that the Qataris "are always throwing cold water on their ideas."  9. (S) On Qatar,s close ties with Iran, the PM added that he knows the U.S. becomes upset at times by what it hears about the Qatar/Iran relationship. However he characterized the relationship as one in which "They lie to us, and we lie to them." Poneman replied by underscoring that "It would be helpful if everywhere they went, they (the Iranians) heard the same thing."  The PM said for Qatar,s part, he  had told Iran that it should "listen to the West, s proposal or there will be military action. If not by the U.S., then by the Israelis by the middle of next year." Poneman observed that the Russians had pressed the Iranians hard during the Vienna negotiations, reinforcing the view that Iranian failure to accept the Tehran Research Reactor deal would lead back to the UN Security Council.  The PM asked if the U.S. believes the Russians were in agreement with the U.S. on the possibility of harsher measures. Poneman replied that, for now, the Russians appear to be holding a similar line to the USG on the TRR deal and we remain in close contact with Moscow.  10.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 DOHA 000733  C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y  - ADDED NOFORN CAPITION  SIPDIS NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2019 TAGS: PREL PTER KPAL KWBG EAGR QASUBJECT: VISIT OF QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 4-5  DOHA 00000733  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d)  1. (S) Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (who serves concurrently as Foreign Minister) of Qatar will visit Washington beginning January 4 to continue the strategic consultations that Qatar and the USG have pursued since June, when Near Eastern Affairs Assistant Secretary Feltman first proposed them in Doha.  As part of those consultations, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmed Al-Mahmoud and Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Mohamad Al-Rumaihi visited Washington last fall.  2. (S) The Prime Minister travels to Washington with the aim of laying the groundwork for visits in the first half of 2010 by Qatar's Heir Apparent and the Amir.  We believe he will be prepared to discuss the gaps between the USG and GOQ on Middle East peace and counterterrorism cooperation, as well as to discuss setting  the stage for joint cooperation on Iran, Iraq and other regional issues.  3. (S) Suggested talking points for meetings with the PM:  -- We thank you for bringing with you to Washington a commitment to fund the PA.  Your decision to do so is extremely important to us.  We view it as a clear gesture of friendship to us and of a commitment to partner with us on Fatah-Hamas reconciliation, just as the United States and Qatar have partnered on Darfur.  -- As your ally and friend, we hope we can look to you to increase your cooperation with us on counterterrorism.  We want to work particularly closely with you and enacting policies and programs that deter financial flows to Hamas and the Taliban.  -- In this context, we applaud your work with the IMF on making needed legal and procedural changes to curtail financing to terrorists.  We are ready to help you with technical support and training once the IMF and Qatar have worked out an action plan.  -- We especially value consultations with you on Iran.  We recognize your national need for a working relationship with Iran, given the natural gas reserves you share with Iran. How best do you think we can persuade Iran to give up its military nuclear aims without military confrontation?  -- We understand that you are close to announcing a decision to open an Embassy in Baghdad, but that much depends on resolving the issue of Iraq's debts to Qatar.  Is there anything we can do to help?   -- We encourage you to recognize an independent Kosovo, as Saudi Arabia and others have now done.  We certainly appreciate your votes in favor of Kosovo in the IMF and World Bank.  They are important precursors to formal recognition, but when will you take that final step?  -- On Yemen, we know that President Saleh asked Qatar to stop its mediation between the central government and Huthi rebels.  Given your past involvement there, what thoughts do you have on bringing about stability on the Arabian Peninsula?  -- We applaud Qatar's decision to make food security a priority, not just for itself but for the entire Arab world. Food security is a priority for the USG, as well, and we share Qatar's view that it must be addressed through a combination of commerce, investment, technical assistance, technology transfer, and direct aid.  Addressing the Fatah-Hamas Split and Funding the PA --------------------------------------------- ------  4. (S) Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) has told NEA A/S Feltman that he will come with a financial commitment to fund the Palestinian Authority.  This is an extremely important gesture by Qatar to the United States.  He will also be prepared to discuss with Secretary Clinton and others Qatar's view of Hamas, continued contacts with whose leaders it sees as key to bringing about a stable and enduring Middle East peace.  We expect HBJ to share what other steps Qatar is prepared to take in support of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and, in particular, Mahmoud Abbas, whose continued leadership  DOHA 00000733  002.2 OF 003   of the PA Qatar's leaders support.  HBJ is likely to bring with him new ideas to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.  Given Qatar's history of mediation efforts HBJ will no doubt suggest that Qatar can play a helpful role.  Qatar's restoration of normal operations of the Israeli Trade Office in Doha would also give testimony to Qatar's willingness to help achieve U.S. objectives, but we do not expect the Qataris to take this step absent some significant gesture from the Israelis, such as much less restricted access to Gaza for Qatar's humanitarian efforts.  5. (S) Qatar almost certainly will not be willing to break off ties or dialogue with Hamas.  If asked to do so, we think HBJ will explain that the Amir gave his word to both Hamas and Fatah that he would financially support the winner of democratic elections in Palestine.  Hamas won those elections, which the Bush Administration pressed the Amir to support actively.  The Amir believes that it would be dishonorable to isolate Hamas after he convinced its leaders to participate in elections that were backed by the United States.  Greater Cooperation on Counterterrorism Needed --------------------------------------------- -  6. (S) It is important to make clear to HBJ that cooperation between the United States and Qatar on counterterrorism issues in general needs to be greatly improved.  Officials should make known USG concerns about the financial support to Hamas by Qatari charitable organizations and our concerns about the moral support Hamas receives from Yousef Al-Qaradawi.  It is also essential to stress that high-level Qatari political support is needed, if financial flows to terrorists are to stop.  7. (S) An International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee began advising Qatar's Financial Intelligence Unit in October (in a relationship expected to last three full years) on making the necessary legal and procedural changes to address the 49 areas in which international experts have recommended changes to Qatar's procedures.  We assess that the FIU is serious about making technical changes that will enhance Qatar's reputation as a global financial center, but we project that, absent political support from the top, the IMF/Qatari partnership will fall short in achieving its goals.  Need for Close Consultations on Iran ------------------------------------  8. (S) Qatar shares a mammoth natural gas field with Iran. As a result, Qatar carefully maintains with Iran a high tempo of top-level contacts , which have increased since the protests following Iranian presidential elections).  Qatar does this because it is convinced that such a close relationship with Iran is key to safeguarding trillions of dollars in potential wealth.  We are convinced that Qatar will not be dissuaded from maintaining those ties.  9. (S) That said, Qatar's leaders -- while careful not to say it publicly -- do not trust Iran; and Qatar does not want Iran to have nuclear weapons.  10. (S) Qatar's relationship with Iran is important to us for another reason.  Qatar hosts the forward headquarters of CENTCOM and allows us to use Al-Udaid Air Base for unrestricted air operations over Iraq and Afghanistan.  We pay no rent for these facilities, and the Qataris have funded about 60 percent of the improvements to Al-Udaid since our partnership on that base began.  While few, least of all Qatar, want a military confrontation with Iran, the USG no doubt would want to use these Qatari facilities in any kinetic operations against Iran.  Right now, we anticipate that Qatar would refuse to allow Qatari soil to be used to attack Iran, short of some sort of permanent USG security guarantee to Qatar, to include its offshore natural gas field shared with Iran.  Finding a Way Forward on Iraq -----------------------------  11. (S) For several months, Qatar has expressed frustration with the current government of Iraq, which it views as too Shi'a in orientation for its liking, but appears now to be prepared to consider investment offsets, provided by the Government of Iraq, but owned by Qatar, as a means for Iraq  DOHA 00000733  003.2 OF 003   to repay the GOI's debt owed Qatar.  That would be an avenue for the resumption of a political relationship, to include an HBJ visit to Baghdad and the opening of a Qatari Embassy in Iraq.  We should encourage Qatar's outreach to Baghdad and also encourage Iraq's government to shore up its relations with Doha.  Recognizing Kosovo ------------------  12. (C) MFA Assistant Minister Mohamad Al-Rumaihi told Ambassador December 20 that Qatar's IMF and World Bank votes in favor of Kosovo show Qatar's true sympathies on recognizing Kosovo.  The Russian President, however, has asked Qatar to "go slow" in announcing recognition, he said. Out of sensitivity to Russian concerns, Al-Rumaihi said, Qatar has done so.  He encouraged Secretary Clinton to ask HBJ about the timing of Qatar's eventual recognition, noting that that Qatar had been approached by organizers of a UK project about using its good offices with the Government of Kosovo to protect Kosovo's Christian heritage once Qatar formally recognizes its independence.  Cool to Yemen's Approach on the Huthi -------------------------------------  13. (S) Having attempted to mediate between Huthi rebels in Yemen and the central government there (before President Saleh put an end to Qatar's involvement), Qatar believes the Huthi tribes have legitimate grievances that the central government must address in dialogue and negotiations.  It can be expected that HBJ will discourage a military approach to solving the Huthi problem and claim that the role of Huthi elements in supporting terrorism in the guise of Al-Qaida is overstated.  Food Security -------------  14. (U) Qatar will host March 3-4, 2010 an international conference focused on food security in the Arab World.  IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) is a co-host, as is the Islamic Development Bank.  The conference will have a set of ambitious goals, to include a conference declaration establishing a permanent secretariat to address the food security issues of the poorer states of the Arab League.  According to officials of Texas A's Borlaug Institute, this will be the first such conference on regional food security issues hosted by an Arab government in the 50 years the institute has been active in the Middle East and North Africa.  15. (SBU) In Embassy Doha's judgment, Qatar's food security policies and strategies reflect the rapidly growing intent by the Amir and Crown Prince to make food security a key national priority for Qatar, not just in terms of Qatar's own food security needs, but in terms of the food security needs of the Arab region. (HBJ supports having an active food security policy, as long as it has a strong commercial focus.)  16. (SBU) That judgment stems from our conversations with Qatar government officials:  -- While QNFSP's short-term focus is on the State of Qatar and building the domestic agricultural sector to diminish reliance on imports, the strategic goal of QNFSP is to export the technologies developed in Qatar to countries throughout the MENA region, and other areas with arid climates.  -- Toward that end, some research results will be part of the public domain and available to everyone.  Some technology transfer to poorer MENA nations will be donor-based, through the activities of the offices of the State Minister for International Cooperation.  The third component of Qatar's strategic goal of exporting QNFSP technology will be more commercially based, and will employ public/private partnerships.  LeBaron

(C) Summary: A XXXXXXXXXXXX businessman who represents the XXXXXXXXXXXX company XXXXXXXXXXXX shared with us a discussion he recently had with a XXXXXXXXXXXX he described as close to Rafsanjani. The XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed Rafsanjani told him Supreme Leader Khamenei has terminal leukemia and is expected to die in months. As a result, Rafsanjani decided to stop challenging Khamenei, and instead is preparing the ground to have himself appointed Khamenei's successor. If he succeeds he will dismiss Ahmadinejad and call for XXXXXXXa new election, according to the XXXXXXXXXXX. The XXXXXXXXXXXX told our contact there was a growing invisible general strike in Iran, whereby hundreds of thousands of workers were going to work but not really working, to show their dismay at the election results. XXXXXXXXXXXX End Summary.2. (C) We met XXXXXXXXXXX with XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX recently returned from meetings in Tehran with XXXXXXXXXXXX executives, including a Board of Directors member named XXXXXXXXXXXX. 3. (C) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX is a strong Mousavi supporter who expected to be a potential candidate for Minister of Industry in a Mousavi government. XXXXXXXXXXX said that XXXXXXXXXXXX explicitly described the June 12 election results as massive fraud, a view he said was shared by almost all business executives and company directors throughout Iran. He claimed the fraud was perpetrated by six or seven Sepah (IRGC) Generals who were afraid the IRGC would be sidelined if Mousavi won. XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted to XXXXXXXXXXXX that he personally knew the director of information technology for the Interior Ministry's election supervision office. XXXXXXXXXXXX described this official as being involved in tabulating the vote count electronically XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX told XXXXXXXXXXXX that this official was promptly arrested by IRGC security agents, jailed, and eventually executed. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the real tabulation results showed Mousavi winning 16 million votes in the first round, with Karroubi coming in second place and Ahmadinejad lagging in third. (Comment: These figures track with the supposedly genuine vote tally figures circulated after the election by pro-Mousavi supporters.)4. (C) Khamenei has cancer: XXXXXXXXXXXX told XXXXXXXXXXXX that Rafsanjani remains vehemently opposed to Ahmadinejad but is biding his time because of a serious health crisis affecting Supreme Leader Khamenei: a terminal case of blood cancer (leukemia). XXXXXXXXXXXX told XXXXXXXXXXXX that he heard from Rafsanjani that Khamenei is likely to die within a matter of months. As a result, Rafsanjani has stopped campaigning within the Assembly of Experts to challenge Khamenei, and now is focused on letting nature take its course. Following the Supreme Leader's passing, Rafsanjani will try to mobilize the Assembly of Experts to appoint him as the new Supreme Leader. If he is successful  though clearly he would face stiff opposition from Ahmadinejad allies in that Assembly  he would then invite Ahmadinejad to resign and call a new election. Because Rafsanjani, Mousavi, and their close supports are anticipating this scenario, they are currently laying low. XXXXXXXXXXXX told XXXXXXXXXXXX that he did not expect to see opposition leaders calling for any further demonstrations or provocative activities in coming months that might undercut Rafsanjani's efforts to position himself as a future Supreme Leader.5. (C) Invisible general strike: XXXXXXXXXXXX said XXXXXXXXXXXX told him that a growing portion of the Iranian workforce was ISTANBUL 00000336 002 OF 003 engaged in an invisible general strike against the regime to protest the contested election result. He claimed that hundreds of thousands of Iranian workers in all sectors (public and private) throughout the country had superficially resumed their pre-elections routines and habits. They were going to work every day, but once at work they were doing nothing or working at a bare minimum pace. The realization that such an invisible strike could hurt the regime almost as much as an overt general strike, but without the same risks, was spreading. XXXXXXXXXXXX predicted to XXXXXXXXXXXX that Iran's manufacturing and industrial production levels, already strained, are starting to suffer even more precipitously as this effort becomes more widespread. Seeking Commercial Advice 6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXX 7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX8. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXXComment 9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX has proved to be a credible interlocutor in the past and XXXXXXXXXXXX favorably predisposed to the United States. This is the first time he shared observations from the XXXXXXXXXXXX. We cannot independently assess the veracity of that information, but we note that rumors have long circulated that Supreme Leader Khamenei has cancer and is in rapidly declining health. If true, Khamenei's departure would indeed offer Rafsanjani a propitious opportunity to exert control over the appointment of a successor, though such an event would likely precipitate factional infighting extending well beyond the closed-door confines of the Assembly of Experts. That Rafsanjani would be able to secure his own appointment as Iran's next Supreme ISTANBUL 00000336 003 OF 003 Leader in the event of Khamenei's near-term death is far from certain, and indeed is only one of many potential succession scenarios that could unfold. The observation about an invisible general strike is noteworthy, but we have not heard similar descriptions from other contacts; we will query several Iran-based contacts on it.10. (C) As a businessman, XXXXXXXXXXXX's primary motivation in pursuing deals with Iranian companies is, of course, the profit motive. But XXXXXXXXXXX, he is a true believer in the idea that significantly expanding western commercial relations with Iran would raise pressure on Iranian companies (and indirectly the Iranian government) to reform their economic behavior and modernize the way they do business, resulting  potentially  in a more moderately-behaved Iran. From our perspective such a linkage is unlikely in the current political climate in Iran. XXXXXXXXXXXX. WIENER

(C) Recent discussions with Turkish and Iranian think-tank, business, and political activist contacts on the issue of Turkey-Iran relations reveal a broad consensus that: (1) Turkey pursues closer relations with Iran out of desires for regional stability and conflict avoidance, recognition of Turkey as an indispensable East-West bridge; strengthening a long-term energy and commercial relationship; and hope that Turkey's approach will moderate Iranian regime behavior.  (2) Iran reciprocates because it sees Turkey as a hedge against its diplomatic isolation, a buffer against sanctions, and a safety valve for its population.  However, (3) Turkey's influence over Iranian decision-making it limited; Turkey has never persuaded Iran to change course on an issue of strategic concern to the regime.  To quote one contact: "Iran knows Turkey is not going to walk away."  On the other hand, our contacts also concluded that Iranian decision-making responds at least tactically to multilateral pressure, which argues that Turkey can and should play a key role to play in supporting tougher approaches on Iran at the UNSC and IAEA.  End Summary.  Views from Contacts on Turkey-Iran Relations --------------------------------------------- 2.  (C) Over the past several weeks, in conversations before and after President Ahmadinejad's November 8-9 visit to Istanbul (ref B), ConGen Istanbul's NEA Iran Watcher has solicited views from a wide range of Turkish and Iranian contacts on the issue of warming Turkey-Iran relations, what motivates each side, and whether Turkey's approach has led to a moderation of Iranian regime behavior.  Contacts with whom we spoke included Turkish academic experts, Turkish businessmen who deal with Iran, Istanbul-based journalists who cover Iran, several Iranian political activists now seeking refugee status in Turkey for fear of persecution in Iran, and several Tehran-based Iranian contacts who follow Iran's foreign policy.  Our conversations revealed an unusual confluence of views.  Turkey's Motivations -------------------- 3.  (C) According to a number of Turkish academic and think-tank contacts, Turkey is pursuing closer relations with Iran for several mutually-reinforcing reasons.  First, the underlying principle:  According to a Turkish university professor who informally advises FM Davutoglu on Middle East issues (ref C), Turkey's pursuit of close relations with Iran is a direct reflection of Davutoglu's academic philosophy and influential 2000 book, "Strategic Depth," in which he first articulated a policy of "zero problems" with Turkey's neighbors.  Another Istanbul-based professor told us that Turkey's Iran policy represents "a triumph of real-politik," with Turkey's national and regional interests trumping any discomfort that Turkey, as a multi-ethnic, pluralistic democracy, might feel about the Iranian regime's harsh domestic authoritarianism.  This contact described Davutoglu as "Turkey's Kissinger."  4.  (C) Regional Stability and Conflict Avoidance:  Turkish contacts, and indeed even MFA interlocutors, have acknowledged in the recent past that Turkey sees a military attack against Iran's nuclear facilities as the worst possible outcome on the Iran issue.  Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability would only be the second worst outcome.  This hints at the depth of Turkey's anxiety about the dangers to regional stability, including Turkey's, of the unintended consequences of any further military action in the region, and explains Turkey's commitment at almost any cost to continued western diplomatic engagement with Iran.  As one contact explained, "After the traumatic violence in Iraq, and fearful that some countries still think military action is an option with Iran, Turkey will do anything to prevent armed conflict."  The GoT's approach on this score enjoys some public support:  Turkish public opinion also considers an attack against Iran as more dangerous to Turkey than Iran acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.  Indeed, almost a third of Turks polled do not consider a nuclear-armed Iran to be a threat, believing that Iran would never attack a fellow Muslim country.  5.  (C) Recognition of Turkey as Moderate Regional Leader and Indispensable East-West Bridge:  According to an Ankara-based  ISTANBUL 00000440  002 OF 004   international relations professor with ties to PM Erdogan's office, Turkey is also deepening ties to Iran because the region otherwise faces a "power vacuum."  No other regional state (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq) has the military and economic power to serve as an effective counterweight to Iran.  Turkey fills this role with the support of regional states who otherwise fear a dominant Iran, including the Gulf States and to some degree Iran's own client, Syria. Moreover, he described Turkey's engagement with Iran as part of a wider effort to stake out a regional leadership position that puts Turkey "at the fulcrum" and makes it an indispensable partner for the west -- whether or not Turkey eventually joins the EU -- in dealing with the Middle East and Central Asia.  This contact acknowledged that this sometimes requires Turkey to tactically distance itself from the USG on several key issues, including Iran's "right" to enrichment and the regime's dismal human rights record.  But our contact underscored that "this is classic triangulation."  Turkey's intention, he claims, is not a strategic distancing from the US. 6.  (C) Strengthening a long-term energy and commercial relationship:  Turkey does not hide the fact that its own growing energy security needs compel it to look to all available sources, including Iran, for energy.  In response, we have underscored that the USG supports the diversification of Turkish gas supplies, while cautioning that Iran has proven to be an unreliable partner in the past and reaffirming USG concern over new energy deals with Iran. Turkey is also actively seeking to expand trade ties with Iran:  Both Turkish and Iranian officials have publicly called for bilateral trade volume, which was $10 billion in 2008, to reach $20 billion by 2012 -- a goal most trade experts say is wildly unrealistic.  Furthermore, Turkey is taking steps to protect and expand financial ties with Iran, for example by continuing to allow Iran's Bank Mellat (sanctioned by the USG under E.O. 13382) to operate branches in Istanbul and Ankara, and agreeing to conduct bilateral trade in Turkish Lira or Iranian Rials rather than dollars and Euros to avoid having to clear the payments through US or European banks. 7.  (C) Tying Iran into regional organizations:  As long as Davutoglu controls Turkish foreign policy, our Turkish contacts predict that Ankara will seek multiple avenues for bilateral and multilateral engagement with Iran, deepening bilateral cultural and economic ties, and working with regional organizations like the D-8 (ref D), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ref E) and the OIC to maximize engagement.  Indeed, Davutoglu's MFA sees regional IOs like these as much more useful tools for engaging Iran, and thus committing Iran incrementally to pursue regionally cooperative policies, than previous FMs did, according to contacts.  Iran's Motivations ------------------ 8.   (C) According to our Turkish and Iranian contacts, Iran is happy to reciprocate Turkey's interest in closer ties because it sees Turkey as a hedge against its diplomatic isolation, a buffer against sanctions, and a safety valve for its population.  Turkey's value to Iran is felt most strongly in these six areas: --Economic:  Iran recognizes Turkey's emergence as a regional economic powerhouse, wants to deepen Turkey's dependence on its natural gas, and sees Turkish markets and bilateral commerce as a hedge against isolation and sanctions; -- Diplomatic:  Iran knows that Turkey's seats on the UNSC and IAEA Board give it outsized influence, and Iran benefits from the occasional inclination of Turkish leaders to give Iran's nuclear intentions, at least in public, the benefit of the doubt; -- Political:  Turkey's refusal to publicly criticize the regime over the conduct of June elections or its crackdown on peaceful protesters, as well as PM Edogan's quick recognition of Ahmadinejad's contested election victory, helped bolster Iranian regime legitimacy at a critical period when the regime needed it most; --  Cultural:  A quarter of Iran's population is ethnically Azeri and Turkish-speaking; Turkish TV programs and are among the most popular in Iran; and one million Iranians flock annually visa-free to Turkey as a touristic "safety valve"; -- Turkey's strategic importance to the U.S: Iran closely watched the spring 2009 visits to Turkey by Secretary Clinton and then President Obama.  One direct result of those visits, according to an Iranian journalist based in Istanbul, was a decision by the regime to try to use Turkey's enhanced influence with the USG to "soften" Washington's approach to Iran.   ISTANBUL 00000440  003 OF 004   The Limits of Turkish Influence On Iran --------------------------- 9.  (C) Turkey's influence with Iran runs broadly, but does not appear to run deep.  None of our contacts had seen concrete evidence that Turkey has swayed Iranian leaders to change course on any issue of strategic interest to the regime where Iran had not already calculated it was in its interests to do so.  10. (C) An Istanbul-based professor who informally advises Davutoglu, and joined him in his September and October bilats (in Tehran and Kuala Lumpur) with Iranian FM Mottaki, claimed that Davutoglu's interventions helped persuade the regime to agree to participate in the October 1 Geneva meeting with the P5 1.  However, all other contacts dismissed that claim, noting that Iranian regime statements and press reports prior to Davutoglu's bilats already indicated that Iran would go to Geneva.  11. (C) Several weeks of intense, personal diplomacy by FM Davutoglu, supported by interventions form President Gul and PM Erdogan, have been unable to persuade Iranian decision-makers  to agree to a compromise deal with Turkey that would keep alive the IAEA's Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) fuel swap proposal, a key test of the P5 1's efforts to engage Iran.  12.  (C) Our contact who advises Davutoglu also asserted that Turkey played a key role in persuading Iran to release several detainees including Greek-British journalist Iason Athanasiadis (jailed in Iran on June 17 and released on July 6).  But Athanasiadis (please protect) told us that while Turkey offered to intervene with Iran on his case, to his knowledge it never did, and indeed Athanasiadis told us he believed it was the Ecumenical Patriarch's personal request to Khamenei (via letter) that probably convinced Iran to release him.  13.  (C) Even on issues of lesser strategic importance to Iran, high-level Turkish intervention does not reveal a record of successfully moderating Iranian policies. According to a Turkish businessman who deals with Iran (Ref F), several interventions from Turkey's Trade and Foreign Ministers, and even a plea from PM Erdogan in Tehran on October 27, have been unable to persuade Iran to lower its customs duties on Turkish imports, currently 45% for finished products. As our business contact explained, even though Iran depends on Turkish diplomatic support and benefits from Turkish gas purchases and other trade, Iran realizes it does not have to sacrifice any critical policy priorities in return, including its customs income, because "Iran knows Turkey is not going to walk away."  Does Turkey Really Understand Iran Better? --------------------------------------- 14.  (C) Underlying Turkey's pursuit of warmer relations with Iran is an assumption on the part of Turkish decision-makers and diplomats that Turkey has correctly judged that the current Iranian regime will be its long-term interlocutor. But Turkey's belief that it understands Iranian political developments better than most western countries is an assumption strongly challenged by our Iranian contacts. These contacts suggest that Turkey draws its assessment of Iran's internal dynamics through a subjective filter, which values regime stability foremost, and thus Turkey's assessments artificially inflate evidence suggestive of regime stability.  15.  (C) According to two separate "Green Movement" activists now seeking refugee status in Turkey -- one a Mousavi campaign official, one the communications director of a reformist party that supported Mousavi -- Turkey missed an historic opportunity by quickly recognizing Ahmadinejad's victory and dismissing the Green Movement's political significance, either as a meaningful opposition movement or as the possible vanguard of a more democratic Iranian government.  Most Green Movement activists now see Turkey as fully committed to the Iranian regime's survival in the name of regional stability, and predict that Turkey will be "on the wrong side of history" if and when Iran's fractured regime faces systemic change at the hands of Iran's population.  "When the system falls and a more democratic, moderate, outward-looking government comes to power, we will all remember where Turkey stood on 22 Khordad (June 12) and after." 16.  (C) Turkey, like the USG, almost certainly recognizes that within the Iranian regime there are at least several factions and key players jockeying intensely for influence.  ISTANBUL 00000440  004 OF 004   The fact that Turkish President Gul agreed to meet former Iranian presidential candidate Mohsen Rezai, a Rafsanjani ally, in Ankara in October (despite the INTERPOL Red Notice issued against Rezai), and the relative frequency with which Turkish officials including PM Erdogan have met influential Majles speaker Larijani, an Ahmadinejad rival, in the past six months, suggest that Turkey -- like others in the west -- wants to hedge its bets on who will emerge as the strongest of Iran's decision-makers, especially if Supreme Leader Khamenei faces future leadership challenges.  (In a telling anecdote related to us indirectly, when Erdogan met Khamenei in Tehran on October 28, Khamenei seemed to be "in a time capsule", asking uninformed or unrealistic questions about Turkish foreign policy, and passively uninterested in discussing the nuclear issue.)  Despite its belief that it knows its neighbor Iran better than most other countries do, according to our contacts, Turkey is just as uncertain as the USG and other western countries as to what exactly is happening behind the regime's closed doors.  Implications ---------- 17.  (C) If the consensus views of our contacts are accurate, it suggests our efforts to persuade PM Erdogan to adopt a tougher public stance against Iran will be a tough sell. Even if Erdogan were to hew closer to P5-plus-one criticism of Iran, Tehran would likely pay him little heed.  On the other hand, our contacts point out that Iran's regime has a clear recent history of making tactical concessions in the face of concerted international pressure, especially pressure from the UNSC and IAEA.  If this holds true, we can and should encourage Turkey to play a supportive role at the UNSC and IAEA as the USG and partners consider raising pressure on Iran in those fora.  As noted Ref G, however, any USG effort to try press Turkey to sign up to tougher international measures on Iran, especially on issues that might impact the Turkish economy, will have  costly domestic political consequences for the GoT.  The key to securing Turkish acquiescence at the UNSC and IAEA, a Turkish professor explained, is to keep the engagement track on the table and even further sweetened (especially with trade incentives from which Turkey might also benefit), even as tougher measures are being pursued.

(S) Summary: A trusted contact claims he was told by a close advisor to Iranian President Ahmadinejad that Iran denied visas for the planned February 4, 2009 visit of the US women's badminton because of the USG's "bad faith" in announcing the visit earlier than Iran had requested. According to the contact, Supreme Leader Khamenei only agreed to the visit after Ahmadinejad urged him to do so, and only on the understanding that no public announcements would be made until after the team's arrival in Iran.  Instead, the USG announced the visit on February 2, as the team was awaiting Iranian visas in Dubai.  The regime wanted to maintain full control of media coverage of the event, to avoid a replay of the 1998 US wrestling team visit, when Iranian crowds were filmed waving American flags and cheering the US team.  The regime believed the USG issued the early announcement to create a similar dynamic, and now Khamenei and Ahmadinejad feel "burned."  Comment: If accurate, this scenario underscores the challenges to building trust with a regime that feels an obsessive fear of losing control over both the process and substance of possible engagement with the USG.  End Summary.  2.  (S) "A first test":  A trusted contact of ConGen Istanbul's Iran Watcher who recently returned from a visit to Tehran recounted a detailed explanation he said he received from a close advisor to President Ahmadinejad over why Iran refused to issue visas in early February to the US women's badminton team.  In comments that track with IRPO Dubai's reftel reporting, our contact says he was told that Supreme Leader Khamenei was initially opposed to allowing the visit, but President Ahmadinejad urged him to accept it.  Even though planning for this cultural exchange began before the Obama administration took office, the regime including Ahmadinejad believed this represented an important early gesture by the new administration to build confidence and show respect, and therefore a "first test" whether Iran could work effectively with the Obama administration.  3.  (S) Maximum GOI control: According to the presidential advisor, the Iranian side insisted on a "carefully calibrated" sequence of timing as a key requirement for allowing the visit to proceed.  Iran believes it had a clear understanding with the USG (working through the US and Iranian badminton federations, which in Iran's case took instructions directly from the President's office) that announcement of the badminton team's travel to Iran and participation in the Fajr Tournament would be embargoed until the tournament's opening ceremony on February 5.  Iran demanded this condition because Iran's leaders still remember with discomfort the 1998 US wrestling team's visit to Iran, when -- because of what Iran now sees as a failure on its part to insist on airtight control over media coverage of the event -- Iranian and international press broadcast scenes of Iranian crowds cheering wildly as the US team entered the arena carrying an American flag and continued to cheer the US team during its matches, sometimes even waving American flags in support.  Khamenei demanded that there be no possible repeat of such a scene within Iran.  Given that the badminton tournament was a women's sporting event and women's sports are not televised in Iran, the regime felt confident it could maintain full control over the event itself, allowing press coverage only of the opening and closing ceremonies.  To maximize its control, the regime insisted on an embargo over any announcement or media coverage of the US team's participation until the team's arrival, i.e., after the team had been issued visas in Dubai and flown to Tehran.  This important detail was explicitly agreed between the sports federations, representing (in Iran's view) an understanding between the highest levels of the USG and GOI, the Ahmadinejad advisor insisted to our contact.  4.  (S) "We were burned":  Thus, when surprised regime leaders saw the February 2 State Department announcement of the badminton team's participation in the Fajr Tournament, according to our contact, they immediately assumed "bad faith" on the part of the USG, concluding that this was an deliberate effort by the administration to gain advantage over the GOI and undercut the regime's control of media coverage of the event.  The regime's immediate response, ordered by Khamenei, was to refuse to issue the visas.  As the Ahmadinejad advisor explained to our contact:  "Battles of this nature, when foreign visitors come to Iran to participate in sensitive or symbolic events, must be on our terms and under our full control.  We had an understanding  ISTANBUL 00000083  002 OF 002   with the U.S. over how this would proceed, and we were burned."  He added that Ahmadinejad, having personally persuaded a reluctant Khamenei to allow the visit, felt particularly aggrieved, and speculated to his close advisors afterwards that this was evidence of "anti-Iranian influence" among recently appointed foreign policy officials in the USG.  In typical Iranian fashion, GOI spokesmen blamed the cancellation on other factors, including (from the MFA) the "time consuming process" of visa issuance and (from Keyhan and other conservative mouthpieces) the USG's failure to condemn Israel over Gaza.  But according to our contact, Tehran assumes Washington "fully understands the real reason" for the cancellation.  5.  (S) Comment:  Although it may seem far-fetched that such a non-political exchange visit would be cancelled over a seemingly mundane detail like the timing of the press announcement of the visit, in Iran's case this scenario is entirely plausible.  If accurate, this scenario highlights the challenges to building confidence with a regime that feels an obsessive fear of losing control over either the substance or process of possible engagement with the USG. Indeed, this underscores that to Iran the process of negotiations may often be as critical to demonstrating "goodwill" and to ensuring eventual success as the substance of the negotiations.  This scenario also illustrates the regime's rigid expectation that, with regard to early confidence-building measures from the USG (especially involving CBMs likely to generate press coverage), the GOI must feel fully in control over how such measures play out, and that at the first sign of any deviation from what it believes is an agreed process, its first instinct -- reflective of its acute fixation on self-preservation -- will be to shut the process down and blame the other side.

S E C R E T JEDDAH 000343  NOFORN  NEA/ARP; NSC FOR JOHN BRENNAN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2029 TAGS: ASEC PGOV PREL PTER SASUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT BRENNAN'S SEPT 5 DISCUSSION WITH SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE NAYIF  REF: RIYADH 1178  Classified By: CG Martin R. Quinn for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   SUMMARY --------  1. (S/NF) During CDA Richard Erdman's September 5 meeting with Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Prince Nayif bin Abdulaziz (reftel), John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, stressed USG condemnation of the August 28 terrorist attack on Assistant Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayif (MbN) and strong USG support for Saudi Arabia in combating violent extremism.  Nayif emphasized that the attack had in no way diminished the SAG's resolve to eliminate terrorism -- despite the danger -- and described SAG's multifaceted approach, which combines refuting terrorist ideology, security operations, and rehabilitation. The Prince also complained that Iran had breached its 2001 security agreement with KSA and was supporting aggression against the kingdom; expressed frustration with European nations for allowing terrorists to operate against KSA rather than handing them over, and requested US intercession to change this European policy.  Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the US-Saudi relationship begun by FDR and King Abdulaziz, especially the partnership between security channels.  End summary.  USG SUPPORT FOR SAUDI ARABIA ----------------------------  2. (S/NF) At a previously scheduled September 5 farewell call on Prince Nayif, Charge introduced Mr. Brennan and asked him to brief on Washington perspectives on current counterterrorism challenges and efforts.  Brennan opened by conveying U.S. condemnation and concern over the August 27 attack on Assistant Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayif as well as our great relief that he had survived the cowardly attack.  In this regard, he said he had brought a personal letter from President Obama to Prince Mohammed expressing our concern and best wishes.  The U.S., he continued, greatly admired and appreciated the courageous work being done by the Ministry of Interior and the Mabahith against violent extremism and terrorism.  SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT YEMEN ---------------------------  3. (S/NF) President Obama felt personally outraged by the attack, Brennan said, and emphasized that it was critically important that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia went forward in the fight against violent extremism.  Noting that he would be visiting Yemen the following day, Brennan said he would stress to President Saleh, in the strongest possible terms, the importance of combating terrorism and resolving the serious problems facing his country.  Brennan also confirmed to Prince Nayif that the USG was working very closely with the Mabahith and would be discussing in the coming days how to approach the threat coming from Yemen.   NAYIF: NO WEAKENING OF SAUDI RESOLVE AGAINST TERRORISM --------------------------------------------- ---------  4. (S/NF) Thanking Brennan for USG support, Nayif emphasized that the attack had not weakened SAG's resolve to eliminate terrorism.  Following the incident, he said, the King met with MbN, who stressed that acts of terror "would not keep us from working and doing our job."  At the same time, the door must always remain open to those militants who wanted to return to society.  These terrorists were attacking the country as a whole and would not hesitate to attack anyone to reach their goals. "Every Saudi official is at risk of attack," he said.  "Despite this, we are still willing to put forth more effort against terrorism, which is more dangerous than any illness."  Fear of losing one's life was not a reason to stop working. We had a duty to defend the country, and it was preferable to die doing one's duty.  "God determined a person's fate and everyone will go back to God."  5. (S/NF) Nayif then described SAG's approach to terrorism as including countering terrorist ideology, armed counterterrorism operations, and a rehabilitation program for militants who surrendered. The SAG has created a strategic communications center where intellectuals and imams worked to explain to the public that terrorists were working against the true ways of Islam and attacking Saudi society.  In countering the spread of jihadist ideology, Nayif added, the Friday mosque sermons -- delivered four times a month in the country's more than 15,000 mosques -- were one of the most effective vehicles.  6. (S/NF) Asked about the economic impact of the recent attack, Nayif asserted that Saudi Arabia was better off than any country in the region and among the best-situated globally in terms of economic activity.  Using a favorite line, he said:  "We know that capital is a coward and wants a safe place."  For this reason, people could invest with confidence in the Kingdom, the economy was growing, and the government was continuing its development plans.  The economy was thriving and the security situation was good despite being among the countries most subject to terrorist attacks. Saudi Arabia had thwarted more than 200 terrorist operations, he said, and only 5 percent of planned attacks had actually occurred.  "We've achieved many things in protecting the country and, God willing, we will achieve many more things with our friends."  Brennan praised SAG efforts to combat terrorism: "I wish other countries in the world were as willing and capable." Saudi Arabia, he stated, was on the front line of terrorism, a model in preventing individuals from being corrupted by the propaganda of Al Qaeda, and thus instrumental in demonstrating to the West and the U.S. that Al Qaeda was a perversion of Islam and did not represent the true faith.   IRAN PROMOTING TERRORISM ------------------------  7. (S/NF) Nayif complained that over the past two years Iran has hosted Saudis (all Sunnis) -- including Osama bin Laden's son Ibrahim -- who had contacts with terrorists and worked against the Kingdom.  SAG considered this aggressive action a breach of the 2001 security agreement between the two nations.  The SAG has informed Iran through its ambassador and the MFA, asking the GOI to hand over these Saudis.  Nayif recalled that after the operations in Khobar in 1996, the SAG tried to open channels with Iran and tried to improve relations during Khatami's presidency.  He himself had met personally with Iranian National Security Secretary General Dr. Hassan Rohani (Iran's Supreme Council on National Security) and had signed a security agreement in which Iran promised to show respect and not take any actions inside or outside Iran against the Kingdom.  Brennan agreed that Iran had the capacity to cause trouble, and assured the Prince that the USG was very concerned and looking carefully at the situation.  President Obama's willingness to talk to the Iranians did not mean he did not understand the problem. Brennan emphasized the SAG's strong friends in the White House, including President Obama, wanted to work very closely with Saudi Arabia on this front.   FRUSTRATION WITH EUROPE -----------------------  8. (S/NF) Nayif expressed frustration with the limited cooperation of friendly European nations with whom the Kingdom has security agreements.  The governments, he complained, shared information but did not take any action. As a result, "terrorists roam around freely in their countries," and the Europeans have not handed over terrorists.  For example, Ibrahim (Salih Mohammed Al-Yacoub), a very important suspect involved in the Khobar bombing, was in Europe.  Saudi Arabia asked several nations to hand him over as a terrorist who had acted against the Kingdom and the United States.  Nayif complained that while these European countries were friendly, had good relations, and shared interests with the Kingdom, he failed to understand why Europeans harbored terrorists working against Saudi Arabia in their countries.  If there were people in Saudi Arabia working against friendly countries, the SAG would intervene. Nayif requested USG help in convincing Europe to work more cooperatively.  Brennan commented that we had similar frustrations with some countries.   USG-SAUDI SECURITY TIES STRONGER THAN EVER ----------------------------------------  9. (S/NF) Throughout the two-hour meeting, Nayif highlighted the importance of bilateral security cooperation, noting that the level of professional exchange has been excellent.  Nayif commented that there has been success in exchanging information, procuring the best, newest, most updated technology and in finding and preventing terrorist acts before they happen.  The final goal, he stressed, was to stop terrorists and "dry out their resources."  Asked by Charge if he meant terrorist financing, Nayif replied:  "Yes. When we say 'resources' we mean people, training, and money.  We have found huge sums of money on many terrorists we have caught." Nayif expressed the hope that through joint cooperation Al Qaeda as the source of terrorism in the Kingdom and throughout the world could be destroyed. He added that the support from U.S.-Saudi leadership in this area was critically important to reach the goal.  Nayif thanked President Obama for supporting strengthened security ties between the two countries and said that King Abdullah was strongly committed to cooperating with the United States against terrorism.  Recalling the 1945 visit between FDR and King Abdulaziz, Nayif declared, "We're acting upon what they decided."  Brennan responded that President Obama would be pleased to hear that the Saudi commitment to our special relationship remained stronger than ever.  10. (U) This message was cleared by Assistant to the President John Brennan.   QUINN
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KABUL 003068  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT FOR SRAP, SCA/FO, SCA/A, EUR/RPM STATE PASS USAID FOR ASIA/SCAA USFOR-A FOR POLAD  E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/27/2019 TAGS: KDEM MOPS PGOV PREL AFSUBJECT: AHMED WALI KARZAI AND GOVERNOR WEESA ON GOVERNANCE IN KANDAHAR  Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Coordinator Hoyt Y ee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Summary: in a lengthy and cordial introductory meeting with Kandahar Provincial Council Chief Ahmed Wali Karzai (AWK) and Governor Tooryalai Weesa, Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) for the South Frank Ruggiero underscored the need for improved governance in Kandahar, and highlighted the importance of naming credible provincial governors and district officials before the inauguration to send a positive signal on good governance to the Afghan people and the international community. Both AWK and Weesa acknowledged the weakness of the government in Kandahar, and outlined their proposals for local solutions, including the empowerment of shuras of district elders for local dispute resolution rather than the courts.  AWK also emphasized large-scale infrastructure projects rather than smaller cash-for-work program, and his desire to see private security companies in the province under one licensee.  AWK discounted the role of elections and their importance to Afghans.  End Summary.  AWK Nervous but Eager to Share Views ----------------------------------  2. (C) SCR Ruggiero met with AWK and Governor Weesa on September 28 in the Governor's Palace in Kandahar City.  The Representative of Canada in Kandahar (RoCK) Ben Rowswell also attended the meeting, which was held in a wood-paneled room, beneath a large photo of President Hamid Karzai.  (Note: While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.  End Note)  AWK, dressed in a crisp white shalwar kameez and pinstriped vest, appeared nervous, though eager to express his views on the international presence in Kandahar.  The Importance of Good Governance ------------------------------  3. (C) SCR emphasized the criticality of good governance in the province, and said the United States would like to see improvement in the post-election period.  He said the United States is ready to work with the GIRoA to strengthen key provincial and district level governance, but we are only willing to expend our resources in people and programs if we have confidence those resources will pay off and make a real difference.  4. (C) Both AWK and Weesa acknowledged there was a credibility gap between the public and the government.  Weesa said it was a problem that in the 10 months he had been in office, the government had not been able to deliver 24-hour electricity to the people, and that 150 factories had closed because of it.  He said people looked to NGOs more than to the government to deliver services, and he complained that NGOs poach workers from the government by offering higher wages.  SCR emphasized the importance of naming credible provincial governors and district officials before the inauguration to send a positive signal on good governance to the Afghan people and the international community.  5. (C) AWK suggested one way of fighting corruption in the province would be to re-establish and empower district shuras, instead of judges or police, to settle local disputes.  Currently there is only one judge for the five districts around Kandahar City, he said, and a council of local elders would be more effective at resolving land, water and other disputes. (Note: there are a total of seven judges for all 17 districts in the province.)  "You can easily bribe the chief of police or a judge,8 he said,  you can't bribe 50 elders."  He said the provincial council, with the support of the governor, could initiate the formation of these district shuras, which would consist of 10-15 elders elected by the people.  Infrastructure Priorities, Private Security Contractors and Conflicts of Interest --------------------------------------------- -----------------  6. (C) AWK said he had been in Kandahar almost continuously since 1992, and that the U.S. reputation in the province was built on the back of two key infrastructure projects done in the 1950s and 60s.  He said what would make a difference to the population today would be similar large-scale, labor-intensive projects that would provide jobs to the people and keep them from being recruited by the Taliban. AWK cautioned against the use of small scale projects and  KABUL 00003068  002 OF 002   additional cash-for-work programs; he stated that the use of implementing partners does not allow expenditure of development resources to reach villagers and other local Afghans.  Both he and Weesa added that it should be the local elders who are empowered to distribute these jobs, not officials or companies from outside.  Putting Private Security Under the Direction of the Provincial Council --------------------------------------------- --  7. (C) In the same vein of providing "local solutions to local problems," as he put it, AWK recommended a "local solution" to the problem of providing security in the area. He said that currently, there are many jihadi commanders with militias who independently provide protection to convoys and projects, but that a proposal before the Ministry of Interior would bring all these commanders under one umbrella in Kandahar, with one person given the license for the private security sector.  He said there would be a meeting Wednesday (September 30) of all the security companies, under the auspices of the Provincial Council, to appoint this representative to send to Kabul.  (Note: AWK is understood to have a stake in private security contracting, and has aggressively lobbied the Canadians to have his security services retained for the Dahla Dam refurbishment.  Both he and the governor have tried to exert control over how contracts are awarded in the province ) all of which could be a significant conflict of interest in the province. End Note.)  Elections: What's the Point? ---------------------  8. (C) In answer to a question from the RoCK and the SCR about the credibility of the elections, AWK said democracy was new for Afghanistan, and that people in the region did not understand the point of having one election, let alone two.  "The people do not like change," he said.  "They think, the President is alive, and everything is fine. Why have an election?"  Comment -----  9. (C) The meeting with AWK highlights one of our major challenges in Afghanistan:  how to fight corruption and connect the people to their government, when the key government officials are themselves corrupt.  Given AWK's reputation for shady dealings, his recommendations for large, costly infrastructure projects should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.  Still, his observations about the unintended consequences of how NGOs and other international partners do their work, e.g. "poaching" of government staff, track with some of our own concerns, including about how to promote Afghan-led solutions.  We will continue to urge AWK to improve his own credibility gap as well as that of the GIRoA. EIKENBERRY
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000760  SIPDIS  NEA/ARP, NEA/RA  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV PTER MOPS KU IZSUBJECT: GEN PETRAEUS AND KUWAITI DCOS ON IRAN, IRAQ, CT, YEMEN AND JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES  REF: KUWAIT 724  Classified By: DCM Tom Williams for reasons 1.4 b and d  1. (S) CENTCOM Commander GEN David Petraeus, accompanied by Ambassador, engaged in a wide-ranging exchange on the evening of July 22 with Kuwaiti Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) LTG Ahmed Khalid Al Sabah.  Key Points:  -- (C) On Iraq, General Petraeus said the USG appreciates Kuwait's robust aid for our Iraq efforts; Kuwait's security remains a top U.S. priority, and we will coordinate closely on force outflows from Iraq.  The U.S. forces relied on support from Kuwait for our efforts in Afghanistan as well. Kuwait should remain open to engagement with Iraq as a means to help resolve disputes between the two countries and help Iraq achieve greater stability.  DCOS Al Sabah responded that Kuwait seeks to rebuild relations with Iraq and prefers that negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait on international disputes be under the UN aegis.  -- (S) On Iran, Kuwait's head of Military Intelligence said the fate of Iran is in Supreme Leader Khamene'i's hands.  He must either compromise with Ayatollah Rafsanjani or continue to support President Ahmadinejad.  He assessed that the public had crossed the "fear line," and continued protests against the government were a possibility.  He thought it would be important to see the Supreme Leader's response to protests.  Continued unrest and government repression may be the catalyst that provokes Iranian security forces to crack down, align with the masses, or fracture.  -- (C) On CT, General Petraeus noted USG appreciation for recent CT actions by Kuwait's Interior Ministry forces, and said passage of comprehensive anti-terror legislation would greatly facilitate further efforts.  -- (C)  General Petraeus characterized the bilateral security relationship as strong, and welcomed the upcoming Joint Military Commission (JMC) in October, as well as Kuwait's continued participation in joint military exercises.  Iraq ----  2.  (C) GEN Petraeus thanked the GOK for its support for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and its facilitation of U.S. forces deploying and redeploying through Kuwait.  He provided his congratulations on the results of the recent Parliamentary elections, noting in particular the election of four U.S.-educated women, and said that it was encouraging to see Kuwait's recent counter-terrorism progress.  Petraeus also thanked the GOK for its financial, reconstruction, and moral support for Iraq during OIF.  He urged that the GOK continue to remain open to negotiate disputes between Iraq and Kuwait, and hoped that such negotiations would be concluded successfully.  He assessed that with assistance from its Arab neighbors Iraq would "muddle through" towards stability.  Though establishing Iraqi stability absorbs a great amount of USG focus, he reassured the DCOS that Kuwaiti security would remain a priority for the U.S., and also promised that the U.S. would closely coordinate with the GOK on working through the logistics of support for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq through Kuwait.  GEN Petraeus said Iraqi PM Maliki's visit to Washington would provide an opportunity for discussion on issues of concern to Kuwait, such as compensation, borders, and recovering the remains of Kuwaiti prisoners still missing from the 1990 invasion and Iraqi occupation.  General Petraeus briefed the DCOS on levels of violence in Iraq, noting that the surge of US forces, fighting side-by-side with Iraqi forces that now number nearly 650,000, has contributed greatly to growing stability.  U.S. combat forces have completed their withdrawal from Iraqi cities, although advisors and liaison elements remain along with joint coordination centers in Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul that provide the Iraqis with access to U.S. enablers and expertise. 3.  (C) In response, the DCOS -- who was personally held as a POW during the Iraqi invasion -- expressed a desire to rebuild relations with Iraq, but, echoing the policy of the GOK, said that all Kuwaiti-concerned negotiations with Iraq should be conducted under the auspices of the UN.  GEN Petraeus informed him, that in a recent conversation with Vice President Biden, he recommended that former Special Representative of the UN Secretary General Staffan de Mistura adjudicate the Iraq/Kuwait dispute.   KUWAIT 00000760  002 OF 002   Iran ----  4.  (S) BG Abdulrahman al-Hadhood, Chief of Kuwaiti Military Intelligence, in a frank discussion on Iran, asserted that the future of Iran, and its relations with its regional neighbors, is in the hands of Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Khamene'i.  The direction in which Khamene'i will lead Iran in this post-presidential election era will largely depend on whether he forges a compromise with Ayatollah Ali Akbar Rafsanjani or continues to pull the "puppet strings" of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Al-Hadhoud said the Iranian public, in staging mass protests in the wake of the elections, had "crossed the fear line."  The next test for Iran will be to face the future reactions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and to what extent the IRGC, the Basij militia, and the regular army are ordered to maintain security.  He questioned whether the IRGC would hold ranks with Khamene'i or begin to sympathize with the Iranian masses should further crackdowns be instigated, as happened with the Iranian Army when it fractured and many joined the mass student protests in the 1979 Islamic revolution. Al-Hadhoud predicted that such a tripwire to tip the balance would be the arrest of Presidential challenger Mir Housein Mousavi.  The DCOS also mentioned Kuwaiti understanding that Iran was supporting Shi'a in the Gulf and extremists in Yemen.  GEN Petraeus asked for assistance in determining if Iran was, in particular, supporting the al-Houthi in Yemen.  5.  (S) GEN Petraeus assured the DCOS that the US military is "very capable" and is fully prepared for various contingencies should unrest escalate or Iran become more unpredictable.  He added that the US military is assisting Gulf states in shoring up ballistic missile and counter air defenses, as well as early warning systems in the eventuality of an Iranian missile launch.  He encouraged the GOK to consider establishing a regional "Center for Excellence for Air and Missile Defense," -- complementing the UAE's Gulf Air Warfare Center -- which would focus on air and missile defense and on the interoperability of systems such as the PAC-III Kuwait now has deployed.  Counterterrorism ----------------  6.  (S) GEN Petraeus congratulated the DCOS on the success of GOK security forces in counterterrorism (CT) operations in recent months, citing Kuwaiti crackdowns on individuals of "mutual concern."  He conveyed to the DCOS that passage of comprehensive CT legislation would greatly facilitate further cooperation in this critical area.  General Petraeus observed that Kuwait, based on its experience with extremists, should recognize that such elements will ultimately turn to targeting Kuwait.  Mil-Mil:  Joint training and JMC --------------------------------  7.  (C) GEN Petraeus told the DCOS that the bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (signed in 1991, renewed in 2001) had proved mutually beneficial and that the USG is inclined to renew it in 2011.  He also said that he was looking forward to the October JMC to discuss with Kuwaiti COS LTG Fahad al-Amir Kuwaiti concerns over the FMS program and the possibility of creating a regional air and missile defense center of excellence in Kuwait.  He also noted the receipt and approval of a Kuwaiti request for an avionics and weapon systems upgrade, and encouraged Kuwaiti participation in joint military exercises like Eager Mace and Bright Star. He also offered to help in the coordination of an Eagle Resolve exercise, should the GOK desire to host it.  In addition, he encouraged Kuwait to send its special operations forces to Jordan's King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center and its fighter-attack aircraft to the UAE's Gulf Air Warfare Training Center.  8.  (U) GEN Petraeus has cleared this cable.  ********************************************* ********* For more reporting from Embassy Kuwait, visit: visit Kuwait's Classified Website at:  http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Kuwa it ********************************************* ********* WILLIAMS
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MANAMA 000442  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/26/2019 TAGS: PREL MOPS MARR AF IZ QA BASUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE VERSHBOW AND AMBASSADOR ERELI MEET WITH KING HAMAD OF BAHRAIN  Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) SUMMARY: In a July 22 meeting with Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Ambassador Alexander Vershbow, and the U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain, Adam Ereli, King Hamad of Bahrain was unwavering in his support for United States policies in the Gulf, welcomed any new requests the U.S. may need from Bahrain, voiced strong support for U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and said he was ready to play a positive role toward Israel.  However, he voiced strong "annoyance" at Qatari behavior, particularly the recent visit of Qatar's Chief of Staff of its Armed Forces to Iran, as well as Qatari rebuffs to Bahraini requests for natural gas.  END SUMMARY  2. (C) King Hamad warmly welcomed Ambassadors Vershbow and Ereli and began the meeting by thanking the United States for the staunch support we provide Bahrain.  He reminded the Ambassadors that Bahrain is a long-time U.S. ally, remains firm in its support of U.S. efforts in the Gulf, and greatly values our bilateral relationship that is of significant importance to Bahrain's interests.  He said Bahrain will do anything to work together with the U.S.  He was particularly praiseworthy of the bilateral defense relationship, commenting that the superb advice Bahrain's Defense Forces (BDF) receive from the U.S. has resulted in the BDF being one of the cleanest organizations in Bahrain's government.  The King also noted that the equipment received through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) process was of high quality and operationally effective, and he was also proud of the strong relations established with U.S. 5th Fleet.  3. (C) Ambassador Vershbow thanked His Majesty for hosting the Military Consultative Committee that was currently meeting in Manama and for his country's support to U.S. interests.  He noted that the U.S.-Bahraini relationship was very strong and mutually beneficial and affirmed to the King that the U.S. and Bahrain shared a similar vision in the region despite its many challenges.  -------------------- Afghanistan and Iraq --------------------  4. (C) Turning to Afghanistan and Iraq, King Hamad said the upcoming deployment of Bahrain's Ministry of Interior (MoI) security unit to provide fixed site security in Afghanistan would provide great experience to MoI personnel and allows Bahrain to show its flag and demonstrate support for the Coalition.  He stated that U.S. involvement in Afghanistan provided a golden opportunity for the Afghan people to build their country's security forces as well as their education, medical, science and trade programs and ministries.  The King added that U.S. efforts should be touted more in the media. He quoted President Eisenhower, saying the "U.S. is soldiering for peace and not waging war" and he understood that the U.S. was not seeking to rule over Afghanistan or Iraq.  He is convinced that the U.S. is in both places to help the Afghan and Iraqi people and he was appreciative of our armed forces personnel performing their duties in places so far from home.  King Hamad noted some instability in Iraq, but thought overall, Iraq was on a positive slope.  ASD Vershbow thanked the King for his comments and said it was important that the world hears his, as well as similar explanations, of U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq.  5. (C) Commenting on Bahrain's participation in coalition maritime operations and efforts against terrorism and piracy, King Hamad said he had recently told his Parliament that, "Ships are sailing to defend the region and why don't we join them?  If we don't join, we will miss an opportunity."  His remarks acknowledged Bahrain's past and current participation in Combined Task Force (CTF) 152 and its anticipated participation in CTF 151.  --------------------------------- Annoyed and Concerned about Qatar ---------------------------------  6. (C) The King voiced concern about what is happening in the region and stated that he would like to see a stronger Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as a deterrent against future threats and to provide more security in the region.  King Hamad flatly stated that Bahrain is not happy with Qatar. He took particular exception to the recent visit to Iran by Qatar's Chief of Staff, MG Hamad al Attiyah.  He noted that during the visit, the two sides released a statement agreeing to joint training exercises, intelligence exchange and  MANAMA 00000442  002 OF 002   reciprocal visits of military staff and units.  "This is going too far," King Hamad fumed.  It's one thing to have trade and commercial exchanges, he noted, but to welcome Iranian military units on the territory of a GCC member state is "a strategic matter."  He went on to say that Iran is the number-one threat in the region; any country should be cautious about exchanging military information with Iran, and no GCC country should allow an Iranian military unit or personnel to land on its shores.  The King stated that he would like to show Qatar some type of unhappiness for its actions with Iran.  7. (C) The King said it is rumored that MG al-Attiyah may retire as the Qatari CHOD and perhaps this influenced his decision to visit Iran.  (NOTE:  In a separate meeting with ASD Vershbow and State P/M Assistant Secretary Shapiro, during their July 20-21 visit to Doha, MG al-Attiyah did state that his visit to Iran was long planned but perhaps ill-timed to coincide with recent post-election activities in Tehran; since it was previously planned, he had not wanted to cancel his visit. END NOTE.) King Hamad added that Qatar's behavior "is an annoyance, but it was too early to be angry at them."  King Hamad went on saying he "would like our brother in Saudi Arabia to send a note telling Qatar not to play like this."  8. (C) ASD Vershbow affirmed U.S. displeasure with Iranian behavior, particularly its nuclear program, and stated the U.S. would not tolerate Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons. He told the King we were disappointed with the timing of the Qatari CHOD's visit, but hoped the Qataris could persuade Iran to engage with the U.S. to end its nuclear program, rather than seeking a confrontation with the international community.  ------------------------- Plug for the Crown Prince -------------------------  9. (C) ASD Vershbow said he appreciated the Crown Prince's recent op-ed published on the Middle East which he understood bore the King's stamp.  He said the Crown Prince's points about Arab countries seizing the opportunity at hand and setting aside past differences to move forward on the peace process was right on mark.   King Hamad responded that Bahrain supported U.S.-led efforts to make peace and agreed that the Arab world needed to contribute positively to this effort.  Returning to Qatar, King Hamad noted that Abdul Bari al Atwan, the editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab daily "Al Quds al Arabi," had written a widely-read article critical of the Crown Prince's op-ed.  Qatar is a major financial backer of al Quds al Arabi, the King remarked, and he clearly saw the hand of Doha behind Abdul Bari's attack.  Continuing on this theme, King Hamad said there were two major issues that made him angry with regard to Qatar.  The first was the Iran issue; the second was gas.  For years, Bahrain has been asking to buy Qatari gas, but their response has always been that Qatar exports were maxed out and it was not prepared to enter into new supply contracts.  These rejections notwithstanding, the King asserted that he had recently learned that Qatar has inked a new supply deal with Mexico and will increase gas supplies to England. He was at a loss to understand Qatari behavior.  --------- On Israel ---------  10. (C) Commenting on Bahraini initiatives with Israel, King Hamad said Bahrain continues to do its best to make Bahrain's position clear to Israel and the world, and expressed thanks for President Obama's recent detailed letter.  He was taking his time in drafting a similarly detailed response, and would share his response with Ambassador Ereli when it was ready. King Hamad said he looks forward to cooperating more with the U.S. on key regional issues and specifically referenced the soon to be executed moves of P-3 aircraft to Isa Air Base and DoD's location of its forward Near East South Asia (NESA) Center to Manama.  ASD Vershbow and AMB Ereli thanked the King for his strong support for U.S. policies and encouraged Bahrain to continue its constructive behavior and leadership in the Gulf.  11. (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this message. ERELI
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 MANAMA 000611  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/2029 TAGS: PREL MARR IR AF BASUBJECT: AFCENT COMMANDER'S MEETING WITH CROWN PRINCE SALMAN FOCUSES ON IRAN  REF: MANAMA 599  Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   1.  (S) SUMMARY: During USAFCENT Commander Mike Hostage and CDA's October 12 meeting with Crown Prince Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa, the CP assured them that Bahrain would keep the pressure on Iran to live up to the commitments it made in Geneva (reftel).  Lt Gen Hostage explained that the threat posed by Iran was leading the U.S. to pursue a Regional Integrated Air and Missile Defense (RIAMD) strategy with GCC countries.  Shaikh Salman welcomed this and stressed that Bahrain wanted to be part of the solution to the GCC's defense integration challenges.  Lt Gen Hostage and the Charge thanked him for Bahrain's commitment to contribute a small contingent for the effort in Afghanistan.  End Summary.  IRAN AND REGIONAL AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE: ------------------------------------------  2.  (S) On October 12, U.S. Air Forces Central (USAFCENT) Commander Lt Gen Mike Hostage and Charge d'Affaires called on the Crown Prince.  The CP commended COMAFCENT for now being forward deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar because it was important to spend time with the U.S.' counterparts in the Gulf.  If more U.S. troops were added into Afghanistan, and Iran tried to delay the process begun in Geneva, Shaikh Salman commented that there would be tough months ahead for the region.  As the P5 1 pursued its carrot and stick approach with Iran, Salman wondered if Tehran would pursue a "tit for tat" in its military posture.  Because of the lack of sophisticated intelligence gathering among the Gulf states, the CP observed that the press "plays a propaganda war into our psyche."  He decried Iran's interference in Iraq.  3.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage explained that, because of the threat posed by Iran to the region, his primary goal was to work on establishing Regional Integrated Air and Missile Defense (RIAMD) between the U.S. and the GCC states.  First, this involved integrating the U.S.' own air and missile defense assets (Navy Aegis, Army Patriots, etc.).  Then he would offer to link each Gulf state into a Shared Early Warning (SEW) Common Operating Picture (COP), to the extent that each government was willing to participate.  The U.S. would share the same picture to all, and each could add as much information as it liked, while keeping data it did not wish to share behind a secure firewall.  4.  (S) The CP responded that this would be the largest game changer because it would be a permanent fixture and would affect Iran's ability to project power.  He thanked the U.S. for the two U.S. Patriot batteries stationed here and said he would like to help further integrate the Gulf states into RIAMD project because it would not be enough without everyone's participation.  He cautioned, however, that the U.S. would have to lead the effort and it would have to be bilaterally with each government, with a multilateral system as the long-term goal.  He asked whether and where the U.S. would deploy a THAAD (Theater High Altitude Air Defense) system to the Gulf.  Gen Hostage replied that the location was not yet certain, but yes, THAAD would be deployed within a year, and would prove to be a very capable mid-course intercept system.  Prince Salman worried that, in an attack scenario, Iran would try to swarm and overwhelm specific targets and we would all have to be ready for that.  5.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage pointed to the Air Warfare Center in the UAE as a Center of Excellence (COE).  A COE for RIAMD could be established there as well as a training vehicle to help the Gulf states get comfortable with the technical solutions so they could share information.  Shaikh Salman said he wanted Bahrain to be part of the solution.  He noted that Bahrain had been the first GCC government to participate in Task Force 152 and it liked to be a leader.  "Consider us serious partners," he stated.  IRAN: TO DEGRADE OR DETER? --------------------------  6.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage asked for the CP's views of Iran's willingness to deal in good faith with the P5 1.  Shaikh Salman said his views had not changed - Iran's behavior would continue to be problematic.  However, he speculated that the reason Iran had changed course and cooperated with the P5 1 in Geneva was due to Russian President Medvedev's comment at UNGA that sometimes sanctions were unavoidable.  CDA pointed  MANAMA 00000611  002 OF 002   out that as the P5 1 pursued a dual track strategy of engagement and preparing for sanctions, the GCC countries' roles would be important.  Confirming that Bahrain would do what it could to keep the pressure on Iran, the CP lamented that Gulf countries had few levers on China.  He thought that if Saudi Arabia were to sell more oil to China, it would help provide some leverage.  7.  (S) The CP asked whether Russia had shipped its S-300 air defense system to Iran yet.  Lt Gen Hostage said no.  Salman said he was  sure that the international community would have to wait until the next election in Iran to see real internal changes.  The regime was still in firm control and Ahmadinejad was consolidating his power, even as the economy was failing.  The world would need a strategy led by the U.S.  "We are still a ways away from knowing whether force is necessary," the CP stated.  BAHRAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN --------------------------------------------- ------  9.  (C) The CP asked whether the U.S. was changing its goals in Afghanistan to a strategy of reconciliation and power sharing with some elements of the Taliban while targeting senior Al Qaeda figures.  Lt Gen Hostage said a way had to be found to let the Afghans live in their, not our, version of peace, but he wondered whether it could be done on our timeline.  Shaikh Salman counseled patience as with the implementation of the surge in Iraq.  Lt Gen Hostage and Charge thanked him for Bahrain's commitment to contribute a company from its security forces to provide inner perimeter security at a coalition base in Afghanistan.  Shaikh Salman stated that  his father King Hamad had approved a budget of USD 13 million for the deployment the day before, so the troops would have the necessary equipment.  10.  (C) The CP asked whether the U.S. would still need to deploy aerial refueling tankers to Isa Air Base.  Lt Gen Hostage related that AFCENT's problems with the Manas Air Base (Transit Center) in Kyrgyzstan had been resolved.  HENZEL

(C) SUMMARY: In an hour-long meeting on November 1 with CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus, Bahrain's King Hamad said Arab states need to do more to engage Iraq, discussed Afghanistan and the positive role India could play, urged action to stop Iran's nuclear program, and reviewed regional plans for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. END SUMMARY.  2.(C) IRAQ: King Hamad fully endorsed General Petraeus's point that increased Arab engagement and influence would help frustrate Iranian designs in Iraq. He added that the Arabs need Egyptian and Saudi leadership in this matter and that he had tried to make this point to the Saudi government, but with little effect.  3.(C) AFGHANISTAN: General Petraeus praised Bahrain's commitment of a police company for internal security at FOB Leatherneck. King Hamad confirmed that he would personally see the force off at the airport on December 16. This date will be the 10th anniversary of the King's assuming the throne, and General Petraeus said that U.S. air assets would be available on the 16th to transport the company to Afghanistan. King Hamad inquired about the extent of India's involvement in Afghanistan and noted that Bahrain saw India as very positive force in the region. "It's a new era," he said. "They can be of great help."  4.(C) IRAN: King Hamad pointed to Iran as the source of much of the trouble in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He argued forcefully for taking action to terminate their nuclear program, by whatever means necessary. "That program must be stopped," he said. "The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it."  King Hamad added that in light of these regional developments, Bahrain was working to strengthen GCC coordination and its relations with allies and international organizations. He specifically mentioned NATO and confirmed that Bahrain had agreed to the Alliance's request to use Isa Airbase for AWACS missions, although the detail on numbers and timing have yet to be discussed.  5.(S/NF) BAHRAIN AIR SHOW AND NUCLEAR ENERGY: King Hamad asked General Petraeus for his help in encouraging U.S. aircraft manufacturers to participate in the inaugural Bahrain Air Show, scheduled for January 2010. He said that France was pushing the Rafale and would be there in force, although he agreed with Petraeus that the French fighter was yesterday's technology. Warming to the subject of French commercial diplomacy and referring to President Sarkozy, King Hamad said, "The UAE will give him a hard time soon," over France's proposed deal for nuclear reactors. "They're not happy with the project he's offered them." King Hamad also mentioned that Bahrain was studying options for using nuclear power to generate electricity. He said he had asked the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Public Works to present him recommendations and invited the Ambassador to discuss with them possible U.S. involvement. Post will do so.  ERELI
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 MOSCOW 001111  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MARR KACT IR RSSUBJECT: FM LAVROV DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE AND IRAN WITH CODEL LEVIN  Classified By: Ambassador John R. Beyrle for reasons 1.4(b) and (d)  1. (S) Summary.  Foreign Minister Lavrov told visiting Codel Levin April 15 that arms control issues were Russia's top priority.  Noting that Moscow was waiting for concrete proposals, including specific language, from the U.S. on a post-START treaty agreement, Lavrov said he recognized that the U.S. would not want to address the link between offensive and defensive weapons in the post-START negotiations, but it would be important to have such a dialogue in the future. Russia was interested in developing a joint missile defense system (MD) with the U.S., but we should start "from scratch," with joint threat assessments, determination of necessary resources, and best location for MD assets.  Lavrov rejected a quid pro quo in which the U.S. would discontinue its MD plans for eastern Europe in exchange for Russia pressuring Iran to end its nuclear weapons program, emphasizing that each issue should be considered separately. He acknowledged that Moscow was concerned about Iran's longer-range missile development and said Russia would be prepared to undertake a "dual-track" approach towards Iran's nuclear program; offering incentives to Tehran, but keeping in reserve measures within the Agreed Framework.  He reconfirmed that Moscow had suspended the sale of S-300's to Iran "for the moment."  In a follow-on meeting, DFM Sergey Ryabkov stressed that while Russia was interested in working with the U.S. on MD, it would be difficult for Russia to join a U.S. MD effort that included sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and urged that if the U.S. intended to pursue sites in Europe, they should be further west and south, so as to diminish the effect on Russian capabilities.  Ryabkov emphasized that "no one can deliver Iran to the U.S., except the U.S. itself," and argued that, while the S-300 sale was "frozen," the "less Moscow heard from Washington about it, the better."  End summary.  2. (C) In a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow April 15, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin (D-MI), together with SASC members Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Susan Collins (R-ME) emphasized that they were united in their hope that the U.S. and Russia could strengthen their cooperation to address common challenges. Noting the Senate's Constitutional role in ratifying treaties and providing advice and recommendations on foreign policy issues to the President, Senator Levin raised missile defense (MD) as an issue that had divided the two countries, but should unite them.  He suggested that if Russia and the U.S, could work together on MD, it would send a powerful message to those who might threaten us, including to Iran.  3. (C) FM Lavrov welcomed the Senators' visit, and noted that it was timely, coming two weeks after the first meeting between Presidents Obama and Medvedev.  He highlighted the important role "Parliaments" play in building constructive relationships and expressed the hope that the U.S. and Russia could overcome the "inertia" that had characterized the relationship in the past.  Arms Control, NPT -----------------  4. (C) Lavrov said that arms control issues were Russia's top priority.  The U.S.-Russia agenda was positive, even though we had differences.  Moscow hoped the U.S. Administration would submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for ratification, and would reconsider sending the "123" Agreement to the Hill.  He welcomed President Obama's remarks supporting nuclear weapons reductions, saying that such reductions were not just a matter of security for the U.S. and Russia, but carried a political message that would be important for the 2010 review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  While characterizing the elimination of nuclear weapons as "a noble goal," Lavrov said it was not "an immediate project."  We needed to have some clear proposals, which would give others a clear idea of the way forward.  He suggested that the next stage after the post-START negotiations should consider how to engage others, such as the UK, in discussions of further reductions, as well as looking at tactical nuclear weapons.  5. (C) There was "a lot to do" on non-proliferation issues, Lavrov said, including Iran and North Korea.  Pakistan was a concern, and we should think about engaging them as well as India and Israel.  The U.S. and Russia had cooperated to  MOSCOW 00001111  002 OF 005   address the danger of non-state actors acquiring nuclear material though programs such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and UN Security Council Resolution 1540.  The U.S. and Russia should also look at ways to strengthen the NPT regime, including how to universalize the Additional Protocol.  We should also work on issues like fuel supply, the Nuclear Fuel Center Russia had started, and programs like the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership.  Post-START ----------  6. (C) Lavrov expressed appreciation for the Senate's confirmation of Rose Gottemoeller as A/S for VCI, noting that the U.S. and Russia had a lot of work to do to achieve a follow-on agreement to the START Treaty.  The issue would be discussed at the meeting between DVBR Director Anatoliy Antonov and A/S Gottemoeller in Rome on April 24, as well as in his meeting with the Secretary in Washington in May.  The teams would report to the Presidents in July, and hope to reach a framework agreement by the end of the year.  He said that while the Presidents in their statement April 1 had endorsed reductions below the Moscow Treaty limits and had agreed to use many of the verification procedures of the START Treaty, Moscow was waiting for more concrete proposals from the U.S., including specific language.  7. (C) Lavrov highlighted the April 1 Joint Statement's reference to the link between offensive and defensive weapons, saying that the balance between the two that had existed in the Soviet Union had been thrown off kilter when the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty.  He stressed that he recognized this did not mean the U.S. would support addressing the linkage during the post-START negotiations, but it was important to have a discussion on it at some point in the future.  Missile Defense and Iran ------------------------  8. (C) Senator Levin said the SASC was interested in exploring the possibility of U.S. and Russia working together on MD.  The U.S. was focused on the threat from Iran, but he recognized that Russia may have a broader perspective. However, we were both opposed to a nuclear-armed Iran, which would be able to put pressure on other countries in the region.  The U.S. also perceived the possibility of an Iranian long-range missile as a threat.  He noted that press reports indicated that Medvedev had told Henry Kissinger and the Hart-Hagel Commission that he was concerned that the Iranian nuclear program was more of a threat than Russia had previously believed.  (Lavrov emphatically corrected this, saying Medvedev had expressed concern about Iran's missile launch).  Noting that the U.S. had made commitments to Poland and the Czech Republic, Senator Levin said the U.S. would need to consider how to keep those commitments and include Europe in a common MD program with Russia.  9. (C) Agreeing that MD should unite the U.S. and Russia, rather than divide us, Lavrov said Russia was interested in developing a MD system with the U.S., but the U.S. proposals for an MD system in Poland and the Czech Republic ("3rd Site"), disrupted the balance between the U.S. and Russia's nuclear potential.  He stressed that then-President Putin's Kennebunkport proposal for a cooperative MD effort using Russian resources, joint analyses and determinations of the threat, and data exchange centers, was still on the table. He welcomed President Obama's statement that if the Iran nuclear issue were resolved satisfactorily, there would be less need for the 3rd Site, but took care to emphasize that Russia did not support a quid pro quo between Russia helping to get Iran to end its nuclear weapons program and the U.S. discontinuing its deployment in eastern Europe.  These two issues should be dealt with separately, on their own merits, Lavrov stressed.  10. (C) Noting that the Congressional Budget Office had presented three alternatives on the MD project, Lavrov said this showed there were issues with the proposal.  Hastening to add that Russia did not endorse any of the three alternatives, Lavrov commended the Administration's intent to review them, noting this was the difference with the new Administration: it was willing to listen and take the time to analyze the alternatives, instead of saying "this is what  MOSCOW 00001111  003 OF 005   must be done; everyone must say yes sir."  11. (C) In response to Senator's Levin question why Russia was not more concerned about Iran's missile capabilities, since Russia was closer to Iran, Lavrov said Moscow was "not complacent; we are closer."  But whenever Russian negotiators had protested to the U.S. side that the proposed radar could cover Russia up to the Urals and the interceptors could reach Russian territory, the U.S. response had simply been that the system "was not aimed at Russia."  As Medvedev and Putin had said, "when there is something risky on the ground, you need to take it into account."  Russia had warned it would need to take countermeasures if the 3rd site was deployed, and that it would put missiles in Kaliningrad.  Noting that Moscow would announce soon just how much it had withdrawn from Kaliningrad, Lavrov said he hoped the U.S. and Russia could find common ground on MD.  12. (C) Lavrov cautioned that Russia did not perceive Iran in the same way as the U.S.  Iran for Russia was "much more than a country which might cause concern in the international community."  Russia opposed Iran getting a nuclear weapon, because Russia did not want any more "members of the nuclear club," but Iran and Russia were historical and traditional partners and neighbors, with a "rich bilateral agenda." Lavrov said he was certain Iran wanted to have a full nuclear fuel cycle and would negotiate from that basis.  It was unfortunate that the U.S. had not accepted the proposals a few years before when Iran only had 32 centrifuges; now they had over 5,000.  Nonetheless, Russia wanted Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA and implement, and eventually ratify, the Additional Protocol.  As agreed to in the E3-plus-3 statement, Russia wanted Iran to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, in a verifiable way.  13. (C) Lavrov commended the new U.S. approach to Iran, welcoming President Obama's readiness for the U.S. to engage "fully" in talks with Iran.  Willingness to discuss "all" the issues was a welcome step, and one which Russia had been advocating for several years, Lavrov said.  Iran wielded a lot of influence in the region, including on Afghanistan, Iraq, Hizbollah, Hamas, Gaza, etc.  Iran had long been concerned about Israel, and saw Pakistan as a nuclear-weapons competitor.  Putin had asked Ahmadinejad during a meeting in Tehran a few years before why he made such anti-Israeli statements, but Ahmadinejad had not responded, only saying that Iran was "not doing anything in the nuclear sphere different from Brazil."  Putin had replied that Brazil was not in the Middle East.  While Iran wanted to dominate the region and the Islamic world, which was of concern to Arab governments, the U.S. should realize that the "Arab Street" considers Iranian leaders to be heroes.  14. (C) Noting that Russia was watching events in Iran closely, Lavrov said Moscow would be prepared to undertake the "dual-track approach," first offering incentives to Iran, but keeping in reserve measures within the Agreed Framework. The Administration's new approach "give us a much better chance than we had in the past.  We will do everything we can to make it work," Lavrov said.  15. (C) Senator Nelson said he was encouraged by the FM's remarks, noting that it might be possible to consider cooperating on use of Russia's radars at Gabala and Armavir. He said he hoped Lavrov was right that Iran would be deterred from building a nuclear weapon, but he was skeptical.  The best deterrence might be for the U.S. and Russia to cooperate on MD.  S-300 Sales -----------  16. (S) Senator Levin said that Russia had taken a practical and pragmatic step with the suspension of the sale of S-300 missiles to Iran, Senator Levin said.  This helped make Israel less nervous, and sent a message to Iran that the U.S. and Russia were working more closely together on Iran issues.  Lavrov acknowledged that Russia was not supplying the system "for the moment," but reiterated the usual mantra that Russia's S-300 contract with Iran did not violate any international or national laws or arms control regimes, and that the S-300's were a defensive system only.  He added that nothing Russia had sold Iran had been used against anyone, whereas U.S. weapons provided to Georgia had been used  MOSCOW 00001111  004 OF 005   against Russian soldiers.  This did not mean the U.S. did not have the right to sell weapons to Georgia, but Moscow did not want a repeat of the August 2008 conflict.  Overall, he said, the Iranians had legitimate security concerns.  They had been attacked more than once by their neighbors, and saw Pakistan's nuclear status as "competition for regional leadership."  17. (S) In a follow-on meeting with DFM Ryabkov, Senator Levin asked whether Iran believed the S-300 sale was canceled or just suspended.  Ryabkov replied that a contract existed, and it was impossible to break a contract without consequences.  He repeated that Moscow had taken U.S. and Israeli concerns into account, and at present Russia was not providing any components of the system to Teheran.  Thus, it was "obvious the degree to which Iran was dissatisfied with this," he said.  But, the contract was not canceled, it was merely "frozen," Ryabkov stressed.  He argued that "the less we hear from Washington about this, the better."  Afghanistan/Pakistan --------------------  18. (C) Senator Collins expressed appreciation for Russia's allowing transit of non-lethal equipment to ISAF in Afghanistan, and asked how the U.S. and Russia could work together to counter terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Lavrov said Pakistan was a place were "a lot of problems start for Afghanistan," and questioned the term "moderate Taliban."  He said the people on the UNSCR 1267 Committee list should be "blacklisted for as long as possible," but for anyone else, as long as they renounced terrorism, cooperated with the Kabul government, and refrained from extremist activity, it would be all right to deal with them.  Ryabkov Meeting ---------------  19. (C) In a follow-up meeting with DFM Ryabkov immediately afterwards, Ryabkov cited the non-paper Lavrov had given the Secretary in the Hague on March 31, and said there was already a good basis to cooperate with the U.S. on MD. Progress had been made in the NATO Russia Council on theater missile defense, and Moscow believed there was more that could be done there.  But he reiterated Lavrov's position that bilateral discussions would need to start from scratch. He disagreed with Senator Levin's statement that the system could not have a significant impact on Russia's nuclear capabilities.  He noted that Russia was more concerned about the radar than the interceptor sites, because the former could see the location of Russia's strategic forces, but even with the interceptors, nobody could predict what would be at those sites in 10 years' time.  In response to Senator's Levin's asking whether the deployments couldn't be limited by an agreement, Ryabkov acknowledged that was a possibility, but stressed that the radar could still be used with other U.S. MD assets.  The sites in Poland and the Czech Republic were part of a global MD architecture, which, when linked together, could almost "knock Russia out."  20. (C) Ryabkov stressed that while the U.S. and Russia were not adversaries now, "intentions could change," whereas "capabilities" were much harder to change.  He noted that the countries in eastern Europe saw the 3rd site as more of a geo-political issue, bringing them closer to the West, than as a response to a potential threat from Iran.  "We are not in a zero-sum game and we do not want to use your possibly legitimate security concern as a geo-political pawn," Ryabkov argued.  Noting a link to the post-START negotiations, Ryabkov said the greater the reductions in number of warheads each side could possess, the more strategically important MD became.  He added that it would be politically difficult for Russia to join a U.S. MD effort that included sites in Poland and the Czech Republic.  If the U.S. intended to pursue sites in Europe, they should be further west and south, so as to diminish the effect on Russian capabilities.  21. (C) In response to Senator Levin's question whether it would be possible to develop a joint radar system with Russian radars at Gabala, Armavir, and Moscow, connected to U.S. AEGIS and THAAD systems, Ryabkov responded that he had not considered such an idea before and would need to think about it.  Such a system, he noted, would become strategic, and would lack the X-band capability of the radar proposed  MOSCOW 00001111  005 OF 005   for the Czech Republic, since all the systems cited were early-warning radars only, but it could be an option.  22. (C) Ryabkov said Russia hoped it would be possible to have a "meaningful dialogue" with Iran, and noted that President Obama's remarks had had a strong impact in Teheran and the Arab world.  But it was still difficult to predict how Teheran would react.  He characterized the P5-plus 1 (E3-plus-3) statement as "very promising," but claimed experience showed Iran would not make concessions under pressure.  He emphasized that it was "very clear that no one can deliver Iran to the U.S., except the U.S. itself."  Civilian Space Cooperation --------------------------  23. (C) In response to Senator Nelson's question about prospects for increased civilian space cooperation and what would happen when the U.S. was fully dependent on the Soyuz spacecraft to reach the International Space Station, Ryabkov said he saw no difficulty with meeting the U.S.'s needs, and said we should both be forward-leaning.  He noted that RosCosmos had suggested to NASA that Russia cooperate on development of the U.S.'s new spacecraft, but the idea had not been pursued.  Ryabkov proposed we discuss the issue further with RosCosmos and said Moscow favored closer cooperation with the U.S. and Europe in this area.  While it was not linked to MD, the more progress we could make on MD, the better able we would be to move forward on other issues.  24. (U) Codel Levin did not clear this cable. BEYRLE
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 001488  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2019 TAGS: PGOV PREL IR IS SY GG RSSUBJECT: ISRAELI FM LIEBERMAN IN MOSCOW  Classified By: Political M/C Alice G. Wells for reasons 1.4 (b/d).  1. (C) Summary: Israeli FM Lieberman's June 2-3 visit to Russia appears not to have broken new ground diplomatically, but cemented Moscow's impression that the Russian-speaking Lieberman is one of their own.  The trip included meetings with Medvedev and Putin, as well as a lengthy discussion with FM Lavrov, during which Lieberman indicated that Israel was not considering a military strike on Iran.  Both sides agreed to hold off on scheduling the Moscow ME conference until after President Obama's visit to Moscow, and Lavrov quizzed Lieberman on a possible U.S. plan to bring together Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  Lieberman rebuffed Lavrov's calls for Israel to ease the pressure on Gaza and halt settlement expansion, while Lavrov agreed to consider Lieberman's request for Russian officials to visit the Israeli soldier held by Hamas.  Lavrov said that "nothing new" could happen on Iran until the U.S. opened its dialogue with Tehran, and repeated Russian concerns about the need to reach a negotiated settlement with this "important neighbor."  He reiterated that Russia had not transferred S-300s to Iran, but also had to consider its contract to provide the missiles to Tehran.  Lavrov thanked Israel for limiting military sales to Georgia, but thought other countries were supplying offensive weapons to Tiblisi, which could be emboldened to start "another adventure."  The FMs discussed expanding bilateral economic ties, and Lavrov raised Russian concern that Israel was partaking in "historical revisionism" that sought to blame Russia for the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s.  End summary.  Behaved Like an Old Friend --------------------------  2. (C) Israeli DCM Yuval Fuchs told us that FM Lieberman's June 2-3 visit to Russia ran the gamut of international and bilateral issues, from the peace process to the payment of Soviet-era pensions to Russian speakers living in Israel. His visit centered upon a two-hour June 2 meeting with FM Lavrov that Fuchs characterized as a standard presentation of views, during which "nothing breathtaking" was said. Lieberman had a hectic day that began with a meeting at Medvedev's home on the outskirts of Moscow, then the Lavrov meeting at the MFA, a flight to St. Petersburg on a chartered plane to see Putin, and dinner with Lavrov upon returning to Moscow.  On June 3, Lieberman had breakfast with former FM Igor Ivanov (a personal friend), meetings with the heads of the Duma and Federation Council international affairs committees, discussions with Russian Jewish leaders, and a press conference.  He then departed Moscow for Minsk.  3. (C) Fuchs explained that Lieberman conducted his meetings in Russian, shared stories about Moscow, and smoked, creating a comfortable atmosphere with his Russian interlocutors.  The Israeli FM "behaved like an old friend" commented Fuchs, who thought that the Russians acted as if they already knew him, although it was too early to say whether this personal diplomacy would have a measurable effect on already strong Russia-Israel relations.  Lavrov-Lieberman ----------------  4. (C) Fuchs said that during the meeting with Lavrov, the GOR's planned Moscow ME conference was not a central topic for either side.  Lieberman stressed the importance of coordinating such efforts with the U.S., and said it would not be appropriate to set the timing of a conference until after President Obama's visit to Moscow.  Lavrov agreed, and said that Moscow did not want to hold a conference that would not produce results.  Lavrov asked Lieberman if Israel was aware of an idea supposedly floated by S/E Mitchell to bring together Israeli and Palestinian leaders; Lieberman said no.  5. (C) Lavrov pressed Israel to open checkpoints into Gaza, and suggested posting international monitors to allay Israeli concerns regarding smuggling.  When Lavrov argued that Hamas had stuck by the Gaza cease-fire, Lieberman retorted that Hamas would break the cease-fire when it believed doing so suited its needs.  Lavrov also pressed Israel to freeze the settlements, leading Lieberman to respond that "life goes on" and settlement expansion was necessary to accommodate growing communities.  6. (C) Fuchs said that Lavrov criticized the U.S. on several fronts, telling Lieberman that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was a "present" to Iran, and the U.S. decision to isolate Syria was a "setback" for a comprehensive ME settlement. Furthermore, the U.S. failure to "listen" to Russia, which  MOSCOW 00001488  002 OF 002   advised against Palestinian elections, had allowed Hamas to come to power and eventually take over Gaza, thereby strengthening Iran's position in the region.  Syria -----  7. (C) Lavrov thought that the Turkish-led negotiations between Israel and Syria had been positive, and said that during his recent visit to Damascus, the Syrians indicated that they were ready to renew talks either through Turkey or Russia so long as they would include the future of the Golan Heights.  Lavrov said that he raised with Hamas leaders the need to allow visits to captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Lieberman asked if Russian officials could visit Shalit, and Lavrov directed DFM Saltanov to explore this possibility.  Iran ----  8. (C) Lavrov predicted that "nothing new" would happen with Iran until after the U.S. began its dialogue with Tehran, although he thought there was a better chance to get a "clear answer" from Iran on P5 1 proposals under the current U.S. Administration.  He reiterated that Russia did not believe there existed hard evidence that Iran's nuclear program had a military dimension, and thought it transparent enough to detect whether resources were directed to military uses.  9. (C) Lavrov expressed Russian interest in reaching a negotiated solution to the crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear program, and the need for the West to normalize relations with Tehran, a close Russian neighbor with which it shared the Caspian and its resources.  He raised Russian concern that an Israeli attack on Iran would cause instability in the region and an influx of refugees into the Caucasus.  Fuchs said that Lieberman responded that Israel "was not talking about such a response" and understood that an attack would cause a "chain reaction" within the region.  Lieberman made similar statements suggesting that Israel was not considering attacking Iran during his press conference.  10. (C) Lavrov reiterated that Russia and Iran had signed a deal to provide S-300s, but that Russia had not transferred any weapons.  The GOR did not intend to provide regionally destabilizing weapons, but also had to take into account how it would be perceived by others if Moscow failed to fulfill its contract with Tehran.  Georgia -------  11. (C) Lavrov expressed Russian appreciation for Israeli steps to limit arms sales to Georgia to defensive weapons, but raised concern that other countries were supplying offensive weapons.  He was also concerned that the recent military exercises Georgia conducted with NATO might push Tiblisi to undertake "another adventure".  Bilateral Issues ----------------  12. (C) Fuchs said that much of the discussion between Lavrov and Lieberman focused on expanding bilateral ties, especially in the economic sphere.  They also touched upon parochial issues of concern to Lieberman and his constituents, such as the payment of pensions owed by the Soviet Union and Russia to Russian-speaking Israelis.  13. (C) Lavrov raised Russian concern with "historical revisionism" regarding the Soviet Era and Second World War, which, he said, was particularly acute in Eastern Europe but was also present in Israel.  He cited Israel's official recognition of the Holodomor, the 1930s famine that occurred in Ukraine.  Lieberman explained that by recognizing this tragedy, Israel had not said Russia was guilty of causing it, nor that it was an act of genocide. BEYRLE
C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 002529  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/05/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MARR RS IR AF UP GGSUBJECT: ASD/ISA VERSHBOW'S SEPTEMBER 30 VISIT TO MOSCOW: BILATERAL COOPERATION, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, MISSILE DEFENSE, MILITARY/DEFENSE COOPERATION  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Susan Elliott for reasons 1.4 (b), (d)  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During consultations with GOR officials on September 30, Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow discussed ways to implement bilateral cooperation in a number of key areas of mutual interest.  Both sides praised progress since the "reset" in U.S.-Russian relations during the first Obama-Medvedev meetings, though both agreed that concrete actions are necessary to realize true cooperation.  ASD Vershbow emphasized that the reset needs to be reciprocal and noted that Iran would be a critical test case.  Both sides expressed interest in further cooperation on Afghanistan, especially in the sphere of counternarcotics.  While the Administration's missile defense announcement has met with a generally positive reaction in the Russian media, Duma and Security Council representatives made clear they had questions about the later phases of the new U.S. plan and questioned whether the U.S. would be prepared for cooperation going beyond information exchange.   Russian interlocutors acknowledged the dangers posed by Iran's nuclear program, but stressed Moscow's skepticism about sanctions.  Throughout the meetings, ASD Vershbow emphasized that Russia's efforts to assert a regional sphere of influence posed a threat to the reset in bilateral relations, and reiterated the U.S. commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Georgia, Ukraine and other partners in the region.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) OVERVIEW OF MEETINGS:  ASD Vershbow met with the following GOR officials:  Viktor Mikhaylovich Zavarzin (Defense Committee Chairman of the State Duma), Aleksandr A. Gorbunov (Chief of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Ministry of Defense), General Yuriy Nikolayevich Baluyevskiy (Deputy Secretary of the Security Council and former Chief of Defense), Aleksey Nikolayevich Borodavkin (Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Grigoriy Borisovich Karasin (First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and State Secretary).  He also met informally with academic experts and pundits and gave an interview to Interfax.  --------------------------------------------- --- U.S.-RUSSIAN COOPERATION -- WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH --------------------------------------------- ---  3.  (C) At all meetings, ASD Vershbow and his Russian interlocutors noted that U.S.-Russia relations since the "reset" have been moving in the right direction, with opportunities for increased bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest.  The Bilateral Presidential Commission and associated working groups will be useful to inject momentum into our work.  However, ASD Vershbow stressed that words alone or mere information exchanges are not enough, and the reset must be reciprocal.  Both sides need to take action to implement agreements already concluded and to pave the way for additional areas of work and to identify concrete projects for cooperation.  Mechanisms for enabling these efforts need to be established (e.g., the Ministry of Defense is currently undergoing a major organizational reform, which has hampered efforts for implementing the previously approved 2009 military-to-military work plan, and both sides need to ensure that planned events are conducted).  4.  (C) ASD Vershbow agreed that next steps must be taken in other areas where we have agreed to cooperate previously (e.g., implementing a ballistic missile joint threat assessment, a Joint Data Exchange Center, and the lethal transit overflight in support of efforts in Afghanistan that was agreed to at the July summit).  The U.S. and Russia must be united in addressing common threats, such as the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of Iran and North Korea.  5.  (C) During his meeting with MOD International Military Cooperation Chief Gorbunov, ASD Vershbow emphasized that transparency should be a major aspect of cooperation. Vershbow observed that DoD has been very open with the Russians about sensitive issues.  For example, DoD has shared information about efforts to help prepare Georgian troops for deployment to Afghanistan in support of ISAF efforts; however, the Russians have not reciprocated in this vein (e.g., their Zapad 2009 and Ladoga exercises).  6.  (C) Both Duma Defense Committee Chair Zavarzin and Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy stressed that they are ready to work on all areas of mutual interest on the BILATERAL COOPERATION, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, MISSILE DEFENSE, MILITARY/DEFENSE COOPERATION  condition that Russia's voice be heard.  In particular, Zavarzin cited the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (1997-2002) in which Russia claims its views were ignored, the NATO-Russia Council (the PJC's successor) in which Russia "still did not have a full say," and Russia's interest in working on anti-missile defense since 2000 which "did not pan out."  ASD Vershbow acknowledged that both NATO and Russia bore responsibility for areas where cooperation was not successful, but suggested that we need to look ahead rather than debate the past.  --------------------------------------------- ------ RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY REFORM POSES CHALLENGES TO MIL-TO-MIL COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- ------  7.  (C) The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) is in the midst of major reform.  International Military Cooperation Chief Gorbunov described the main goal of the reform as the creation of the "most effective military force in the world," despite existing limitations (e.g., demographics, large landmass and borders, resources, and various threats along the borders).  He identified two distinct processes as part of the reform -- building of the armed forces and control of the forces.  Today, Russia is focusing on building the forces, including a large influx of civilian personnel in management and specialist roles, improving pay/benefits of service members, improving quality of equipment, and trying to change decision-making processes at all levels.  Gorbunov emphasized that these changes are intended to make Russia a strong competitor, but also a reliable partner.  8.  (C) Gorbunov explained that the reform process is having a significant impact on the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation (GUMVS) at the MOD.  The Foreign Liaison Directorate (UVS) is being closed on October 1, and a new International Liaison Directorate is being created.  Because of these changes, correspondence will be slow over the next six weeks or so, which will impact the Attache Corps in Moscow.  Gorbunov offered his personal assistance during this period.  9.  (C) ASD Vershbow raised the Bilateral Defense Consultations (BDC) which the U.S. had proposed for November, and suggested the possibility of a broader dialogue between the MOD and DoD on policy and strategy issues to complement State-MFA exchanges.  Vershbow explained that DoD's proposed BDC topics (including confidence-building measures and transparency, risk reduction and notification procedures, expanded military technical cooperation, etc.) were carefully considered, but we welcomed Russia's suggestions for additional topics.   Gorbunov responded that the MoD agrees with the general notion of the BDC, but stipulated that the General Staff needs to identify the right experts to address topics to be discussed, and they plan to propose other topics for consideration.  He gave no indication as to when a response would be provided.  --------------------------------------------- --------------  AFGHANISTAN:  NARCO-TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, ILLICIT FINANCE --------------------------------------------- --------------  10.  (C) ASD Vershbow's meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister Borodavkin and MOD International Cooperation Chief Gorbunov particularly focused on Afghanistan.  Borodavkin mentioned that Russia views Afghanistan not only as a threat, but as an opportunity for cooperation with the U.S. and other countries (e.g., NATO), and suggested that ISAF could play an important role in fighting illegal drug trafficking.  He recalled that the U.S. and NATO had participated in the March 2009 conference held in Moscow at which counternarcotics was a top priority.  11.  (C) When asked by Borodavkin about whether more U.S. troops will be sent to Afghanistan, ASD Vershbow explained that General McChrystal's assessment is being reviewed at the highest levels.  He noted that while the situation in Afghanistan has not gone as well as hoped over the past six months, the U.S. cannot allow the Taliban to regain control. Expansion and training of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), improving governance, and economic assistance are all still essential components of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and we will continue to seek cooperation in these areas.  12.  (C) Borodavkin introduced a number of proposals for increased Russian contribution.  He said that Russia would like to launch cooperation with the U.S. on the economic rehabilitation of Afghanistan and referred to a clause in the July Summit Joint Statement that without economic improvement, terrorism and other threats cannot be eliminated.  Borodavkin suggested tripartite cooperation (Russia-U.S.-Afghanistan) to reconstruct the Soviet-era Salang Tunnel to provide a much needed reliable transportation route.  The Russians have already undertaken a technical study on this project and Borodavkin said that with adequate resources, it would be a useful cooperative effort. (Note:  Borodavkin's staff confirmed that the MFA has submitted a proposal to the State Department on the Salang Tunnel.)  13.  (C) Russia considers narco-trafficking to be its highest priority vis-a-vis Afghanistan.  Borodavkin said Russia is ready to help the Afghan National Police (ANP) and Interior Ministry in these efforts.  He noted that Russia is already providing counternarcotics training to the Afghans at the Domodedovo Center, and mentioned Russian counter-narcotics chief Ivanov's statement that he is ready to provide increased assistance on bilateral and multilateral levels such as NATO and the OSCE.   Both Borodovkin and Vershbow agreed that while the U.S. and Russia are currently working together on this and the related issue of threat financing through the Bilateral Presidential Commission, we need to address these problems more forcefully.  Illicit financing has been raised at Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and OSCE meetings, offering one area of possible cooperation.  14.  (C) At his meetings at the MOD and MFA, ASD Vershbow expressed appreciation for Russia's expression of interest in providing weapons and equipment to the ANSF, and requested that any such help be made in the form of donations with no fees attached, as those charges would have to be paid for by the U.S.  He underscored that some of the equipment/weapon donation requests provided to Russia are intended to support counter-narcotics efforts, so the U.S. hopes Russia will be able to provide this support.  ASD Vershbow also asked that Russia work with the Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan (CSTC-A) to ensure that ANSF priority requirements are met and provided a list of requirements.   15.  (C) Borodavkin said that Russia will be able to supply limited numbers of weapons to the ANP as aid and will consider selling more weapons to the ANP and the Afghan National Army (ANA).  He also expressed concern that there are unlicensed (counterfeit) Russian weapons on the market, which are of inferior quality.  Gorbunov explained that donating equipment and weapons to Afghanistan is a presidential decision, which would entail President Medvedev asking the military services to donate items from current stocks.  16.  (C) Borodavkin also asked ASD Vershbow's perspectives on the European proposal for a conference on Afghanistan after the new Afghan government is established.  ASD Vershbow said the U.S. saw merit in this idea as a means of seeking additional international support for Afghanistan, but noted that the timing of the initiative will depend on Afghanistan's domestic politics; given the problems with the Presidential elections, conditions were not yet right.  17.  (C) Borodavkin mentioned the work of the Afghanistan sub-working group under the Bilateral Presidential Commission and stated that the Foreign Ministry is hoping that Amb. Holbrooke can reschedule his planned visit to Moscow. Borodavkin requested that ASD Vershbow pass on the invitation to Amb. Holbrooke.  18.  (C) ASD Vershbow also raised the lethal transit agreement signed at the July summit in his meetings with Gorbunov, Borodavkin, and Zavarzin.  He underscored the importance of a timely Duma decision now that the General Authorization has been delivered.  ASD Vershbow expressed hopes that the inaugural flight of the agreement could take place prior to Secretary of State Clinton's visit to Moscow on October 12-14.  Zavarzin thought the Duma would approve the agreement without any problem; Borodavkin confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working on the request, but warned that they do not have the sole voice on this matter.  --------------------------------------------- MISSILE DEFENSE DECISION:  NEITHER CONCESSION   NOR THREAT TO RUSSIA ---------------------------------------------  19.  (C) ASD Vershbow discussed the recent U.S. missile defense decision during each of his consultations.  In his meeting with Duma Defense Committee Chairman Zavarzin, ASD Vershbow observed that the Russian press may have been overly positive in its assessment of the September 17 announcement, focusing on the cancellation of the Program of Record rather than the new MD architecture.  While the new phased adaptive approach to MD does not pose a threat to Russia, there will likely continue to be missile defense elements in central-eastern Europe, with an SM-3 site in Poland if the Government of Poland agrees.  However, the physical characteristics of the new system are different from the old, and the U.S. believes Russia has no basis for concern that the system could threaten its strategic forces.  The new architecture will be more effective and be able to provide protection to vulnerable parts of Europe more quickly. Vershbow emphasized that the U.S. intends to be open about the new architecture, citing information available through congressional testimony and other open sources.  The U.S. aim is to make this a project for NATO because the system is designed to protect all of NATO's territory (starting in southeastern Europe, where the current threat is, but eventually covering all of NATO).  20.  (C) ASD Vershbow affirmed the U.S. also views missile defense as an opportunity for cooperation with Russia against a common threat, noting Secretary of Defense Gates' support for cooperation on missile defense.  Vershbow emphasized to Zavarzin and Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy that we should begin by implementing the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC), on which the Russians had postponed a decision until after the U.S. missile defense announcement.  Vershbow told Zavarzin and Baluyevskiy that linking radars could follow, which could then lead to broader areas of cooperation that could be implemented either bilaterally or within the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) framework.  He suggested that U.S. and Russian experts explore concrete ways to implement military technical cooperation, noting that such cooperation would be mutually beneficial and would send a strong signal to Iran that could help in resolving the nuclear issue.  21.  (C) Zavarzin acknowledged that the Russian political elite has no illusions about missile defense and understands this was a U.S. decision with no quid pro quo expected from Russia.  Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy noted that the system's planned capability to intercept ICBMs does raise some of the same concerns Russia has had before. Zavarzin agreed that we need to identify specific projects to work on together, but that Russia wants to ensure its voice will be heard.  Both Zavarzin and Baluyevskiy stressed the need to develop bilateral cooperation methods, potentially by linking existing U.S. and Russian early warning systems to gather and share information about threats.  They also asked whether the U.S. was prepared to go even farther, to include joint technology projects, which would of greater interest to Russia than information exchange.  --------------------------- U.S.-RUSSIAN UNITY ON IRAN? ---------------------------  22.  (C) ASD Vershbow discussed the serious test that Iran's nuclear program will pose to both Russia and the U.S. in the coming months, noting that our interests coincide in many ways, even if they are not identical.  The U.S., he stated, wants to see if diplomacy can succeed, but we need to be realistic and be prepared for tougher measures if diplomacy fails.  Citing the recently exposed covert nuclear facility and the recent missile tests, Vershbow described the situation as urgent, and said that the U.S. was encouraged by President Medvedev's recent comment that sanctions might become necessary.  23.  (C) ASD Vershbow mentioned that the Islamic world is very concerned about Iran's nuclear program (e.g., several of its Arab neighbors have asked the U.S. for Patriot missiles and other measures to protect them against Iranian attack). The ability of the U.S. and Russia to work together on the Iran challenge over the next few months will be just as important as our work on missile defense will be over the next few years.  ASD Vershbow stressed that if we fail to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, we could have a "volatile, possibly explosive," situation in the Middle East.   24.  (C) In their respective meetings, Duma Defense Committee Chairman Zavarzin and Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy agreed that Iran is a concern, but said that Russia continues to work closely with them and that sanctions cannot be pursued until after diplomatic efforts have been made.  Deputy Foreign Minister Borodavkin expressed concern that sanctions could be ineffective (citing past experience in Iraq) and could have a negative impact on the wider Islamic world.  ---------------------------------------- RUSSIA'S "SPHERE OF PRIVILEGED INTEREST" ----------------------------------------  25.  (C) ASD Vershbow stated in several meetings that our interaction in the post-Soviet space continues to be a sensitive issue and, if not handled carefully, could undermine recent gains in bilateral relations.  In this regard, President Medvedev's proposed amendment to the law on use of Russian forces overseas has raised many questions. Duma Defense Committee Chairman Zavarzin said that Russia will not interfere with the U.S. as it engages with nations in the region, and that there is no cause for concern regarding the legislation about use of Russian forces -- it is intended to protect Russian citizens living in those countries and that other countries have similar provisions.  26.  (C) UKRAINE:  ASD Vershbow spoke of his visit to Ukraine immediately preceding his arrival in Moscow, and cited Ukrainian concerns about Russian respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and borders.  Vershbow stated that the U.S. continues to support the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and Ukraine's freedom to choose its security relationships, and encourages Russia to reaffirm its adherence as well.  He suggested that President Medvedev's open letter to Ukraine had been counter-productive.  The U.S. favors close and mutually beneficial Russian-Ukrainian relations -- this is not a zero-sum game.  27.  (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin said that Ukraine is Russia's closest neighbor, and is a "key partner" in international activities.  Russia is not trying to influence Ukraine, but wants a stable Ukraine and a secure neighborhood.  He also said that Russia cannot ignore attempts to depict it as a major threat to Ukraine.  Foreign Minister Lavrov will be visiting Ukraine this week to meet with Ukrainian Acting Foreign Minister Khandogiy and there even is a possibility that Medvedev and Ukrainian President Yushchenko will meet at a summit of CIS countries shortly after that.  Karasin said that Russia wants to deal with Ukraine in a normal way and that Ukrainian citizens are the ones to decide what they want.  28.  (C) GEORGIA:  Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy, Zavarzin, and Karasin asked why the U.S. is providing military assistance to Georgia when it threatens stability in the Caucasus region.  This causes concern and Russia cannot allow renewed aggression against Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  ASD Vershbow explained that as a matter of principle, the U.S. will help Georgia protect its sovereignty and independence, but stated that the U.S. is not rearming Georgia, as Russia has repeatedly alleged.  Since the August 2008 war, there has been no U.S. lethal assistance to Georgia; DoD funds were transferred to the State Department for humanitarian purposes.  In the short term, the U.S. is proceeding with great care and focusing on training, education, and helping prepare Georgia to participate in Afghanistan under the command of U.S. Forces.  At the same time, Georgia is a sovereign state with the right to self-defense.  We do not accept any arms embargo, and we may provide weapons to Georgia in the future.  29.  (C) Zavarzin made a point of saying that Russia does not dispute Georgia's sovereignty, but it cannot allow new acts of aggression; a regional consensus is necessary.  Karasin said that, in Russia's view, the current Georgian leadership is irresponsible.  ASD Vershbow reiterated that the U.S. had made clear to Georgia that there is no military option regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia and that the Georgians need to take a long view on reintegration of the territories.  Karasin noted some successes in repairing relations since last August, including the Geneva talks that enable the Georgians to talk directly to the Abkhaz and Ossetians. Vershbow said that stability in the Caucasus and creating conditions to help improve Georgian-Russian relations is very important to the U.S.   30.  (C) Karasin mentioned the EU independent report on the August 2008 conflict in Georgia, which had just been released on the afternoon of September 30.  ASD Vershbow mentioned that he looked forward to reading the report and stressed that even if we do not agree completely on the report's findings, we need to look ahead and promote stability in the region, including an international presence in the territories.  Karasin said that international presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia must be discussed with the Abkhaz and the Ossetians (not the Russians).  Russia has "bilateral agreements" with them, and Russian border guards are protecting them to help restore stability.  31.  (C) Karasin asked whether the U.S. intends to establish a military presence in Georgia by contributing personnel to the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM).  This would be a serious problem for Russia, as they believe it would send the wrong message to President Saakashvili that he could use force again.  ASD Vershbow said there has been lots of speculation on this subject that was not based on fact.  If the EUMM did make such a request in the future, the U.S. would consider it, but this would likely involve civilian monitors. Vershbow added that Russia needs to fully withdraw its forces from positions beyond the line of the outbreak of hostility, per the Medvedev-Sarkozy agreement, since this non-compliance was a continuing source of tension.  Karasin insisted that  Russia was in compliance, while acknowledging that the U.S. does not see it that way.  ------------ OTHER ISSUES ------------  32.  (C) EUROPEAN SECURITY TREATY:  In response to Baluyevskiy's inquiry about President Medvedev's proposed European Security Treaty, ASD Vershbow acknowledged there could be ways to improve the effectiveness of existing conflict-prevention mechanisms, but that the U.S. and most of our allies did not see a need for new structures or a new treaty.  However, the U.S. is ready to engage with Russia on this issue in the Corfu process and other fora.  33.  (C) CENTRAL ASIA:  Karasin inquired about the Manas Transit Center and the numbers of U.S. military personnel that would be deployed under the new arrangement.  ASD Vershbow said that he did not have precise figures.  However, in contrast with the previous agreement, security for the facility is now being provided by the Kyrgyz, which reduced the U.S. presence somewhat.  34.  (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this cable. Beyrle
C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 002531  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/06/2019 TAGS: PGOV PREL RS IRSUBJECT: MEDVEDEV, PUTIN, AND RUSSIA'S IRAN POLICY  Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  Despite Russian President Medvedev's September 24 remarks that sanctions against Iran might be necessary, other government officials and experts here caution that Russia will remain, for the time being, reluctant to pursue a tougher line against Tehran.  The consensus among the Russian political elite is that maintaining a dialogue with the Iranians and exhausting diplomatic avenues is preferable to imposing sanctions in the near term.  While Medvedev as president is responsible for controlling arms and nuclear technology transfers, Prime Minister Putin remains closely identified with decisions on Iran policy, including the sale of civilian nuclear technology and weapons, which provides a boost to powerful state enterprises.  According to Deputy FM Ryabkov, Putin's relative silence on Iran since Medvedev's statements does not signal any difference between them on sanctions.  End Summary.  Medvedev on Sanctions: Few Official Echoes ------------------------------------------  2. (C) Russian Government officials, including Prime Minister Putin, have not yet echoed President Medvedev's public statement that Russia would consider the imposition of sanctions on Iran if the world community ran out of other options.  Asked about Russian views on the Qom revelation in New York September 25, FM Lavrov adopted a strikingly softer tone than in the just released Kremlin statement.  He noted that Iran had acted positively by notifying the IAEA about its plans to construct a new nuclear facility, and complained that some of Russia's "partner countries" in the P5-plus-1 had not shared information about the Qom facility earlier. Lavrov stressed that Iran's cooperation with the world community as a member of the NPT with non-nuclear status could prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  3. (C) Before the most recent P5-plus-1 meeting in Geneva, PM  Putin said that Russia would not support "significant" changes to its approach on Iran.  Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said Putin and Lavrov told him in early September that they are opposed to tougher sanctions and the use of force against Iran.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minster Sergei Ryabkov said September 29 that Iran's recent proposals presented a "broad field for dialogue." Ryabkov added that whether sanctions against Iran might become inevitable was a "completely separate issue, one that we are not yet ready to address."  He stressed Russia's position was to do everything possible to find a "diplomatic, political solution to the Iranian nuclear problem."  4. (SBU) While expressing concern over Iran's missile program, Russian Ambassador to NATO Dmitriy Rogozin stressed September 29 that Russia preferred political dialogue over tough measures that could trigger an "arms race in the region."  Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak said September 24 that sanctions were not the way to resolve the problem; rather, the point was how to find a "political solution that would eliminate this problem."  The priority was to "start a serious dialogue with our Iranian partners in seeking a way out of the situation."  5. (C) Russia's message to domestic audiences also remains unchanged.  Despite Medvedev's carefully worded comments on sanctions in New York (called by one analyst here "a jewel of diplomatic casuistry"), even prominent Russians with ties to the Kremlin's domestic propaganda machine believe Russian support for Western sanctions is highly unlikely.  Medvedev advisor Gleb Pavlovskiy, President of the Effective Policy Foundation, and Maksim Shevchenko, President of the Russian World Foundation, even spoke in favor of completing Russia's frozen S-300 surface-to-air missile deal with Iran.  Interpreting Putin's Silence ----------------------------  6. (C) PM Putin's lack of public comment on the possibility of Iran sanctions after President Medvedev's public statement does not indicate disagreement between them on Iran, DFM Ryabkov told Ambassador Beyrle October 3.  Ryabkov repeated his comments, made in Geneva during P5-plus-1 talks, that Russia had not ruled out the possibility of sanctions, but would begin to contemplate them only as an absolute last resort.  7. (C) Most political commentators and analysts here have been echoing the same statements.  Tatyana Stanovaya of the Center for Political Technologies thought that Medvedev's seemingly more positive statement indicates no real rapprochement with the U.S. on Iran.  Rather, she said, his words are carefully calibrated to indicate a welcoming of U.S. willingness to use the P5-plus-1 format and engage in actual discussions with Iranian officials.  8. (C) Nevertheless, Medvedev's New York comments and the September 25 Kremlin statement mark a definite toughening of Russian rhetoric on Iran.  Pravoe Delo co-Chairman Georgiy Bovt told us October 5 that Medvedev's use of the word "sanctions" represents a policy change.  Boyt cautioned that Medvedev's words would probably resonate with only a distinct minority of Russian society.  He believes it will be hard for Medvedev to sell Iran sanctions to the Russian bureaucracy without the full support of Putin.  At the Sochi Economic Forum, Putin blasted the U.S. for not allowing the export of certain high technology to Russia.  Boyt thinks Russia might ask for an easing of these restrictions in exchange for supporting sanctions.  Sanctions: Economic Implications --------------------------------  9. (C) Despite Medvedev's presidential authority over arms transfers, Putin undoubtedly retains a critical, if not decisive role over an issue with such significant domestic economic implications as the transfer of nuclear technology and armaments to Iran.  Russia and Iran currently have limited military cooperation, so the effect of any lost revenue from arms sales to Iran would be small.  While the sale of S-300s to Iran, for example, would only net Russia from USD 750 million to USD one billion, future military sales could be considerably larger.  10. (C) Several years ago Iran was a stable source of hard currency and this cash flow helped Russia preserve its nuclear construction sector.  The importance of Russia's trade with Iran has decreased, but Russian exports to Iran last year still exceeded USD 3 billion.  In the currently depressed Russian economy, that is not an insignificant amount.  In addition, great potential for future economic gain to Russia exists via civilian nuclear technology sales and increased military cooperation.  11. (C) As the world's largest exporter of oil and gas, Russia also benefits significantly from the "instability premium" embedded in world oil prices due to tensions with Iran.  Even a USD 5 per barrel instability premium would net Russia almost USD 9 billion per year for oil and approximately USD 2-4 billion from its gas exports.  Finally, given Iran's position as the second largest owner of gas reserves, Russia's gas sector clearly benefits from the lack of international investment in the development of Iran's natural gas sector.  Life without Iran -----------------  12. (C) Russia could profit from alternatives to its continued support for Iran.  For example, news reports indicate that Saudi Arabia has offered to purchase the Russian S-400 system for USD two billion in an effort to force Moscow to back out of the S-300 deal with Iran. Medvedev cited Arab League concerns about Russia's close relationship with Iran when he stated that Russia's stance on Iran might be changing.  13. (C) Israel also is clearly pushing Russia to take a firmer stance towards Tehran, in light of recent press reports that PM Netanyahu personally delivered a list of Russian scientists who contributed to Iran's nuclear program.  Conversations with Israeli diplomats in Moscow indicate that Israel believes there may be even more to Iran's program than is now known to the GOR and Russian decision makers.  They hint that Israeli disclosures on Russian participation could force Moscow into taking a harder line.  COMMENT -------  14. (C) Success in moving Russia to support tougher actions against Iran will require a coordinated strategy involving our friends and allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. The strategy may need to include the continuation of diplomatic efforts like the P5-plus-1 process and perhaps include new ways of engaging in dialogue with Iran.  A strategy created by a broad international consensus must offer Moscow a series of options that will challenge the stubborn mentality here that instinctively opposes common cause with the West on Iran.  Sanctions would have a major impact on the Russian economy, and especially to the domestic constituencies like RosOboronexport and RosAtom.  The fact that the economy and these key state-controlled enterprises are part of Putin's portfolio only reinforces the certainty that he will remain the key decision maker on any imposition of sanctions.  Key to the GOR's calculations would be any politically salable alternatives that benefit them both economically and politically.  End comment. Beyrle
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 MOSCOW 003010  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/2019 TAGS: PGOV PREL KNNP IAEA RS IRSUBJECT: MOSCOW'S INCREASING FRUSTRATION WITH TEHRAN  Classified By: Acting Political M/C David Kostelancik for reasons 1.4 ( b) and (d).  1.  (C)  Summary:  Official GOR reports and media have pronounced the Russian-Iranian relationship healthy and Minister of Energy's Shmatko's recent visit to Tehran as a success.  Privately, GOR officials and Russian analysts agree that there are serious tensions in the bilateral relationship such as the S-300s issue, the Bushehr project and the possibility of Russia's support of sanctions.  They downplay Moscow's ability to influence Iran, noting competing interests within Russia that complicate Russian policy decisions.  Iran policy remains a sensitive domestic question.  End Summary  --------------------------- Signaling Iran on Sanctions ---------------------------  2.  (C) Italian Embassy interlocutors in Moscow reported that, during his recent visit to Rome, President Medvedev confided to PM Berlusconi that dealing with Iran lately had been "frustrating."  Medvedev said he was bothered by Iran's refusal to accept the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal and that Iran's reaction showed a lack of trust for Russia. While Russia did not necessarily agree that sanctions would be effective, he said, the threat of sanctions could signal Iran that it was time to change course.  Medvedev admitted that he did not know who was making decisions in Tehran now, but he was nevertheless optimistic that there was still some room for negotiation on the TRR proposal.  3.  (C) Ali Mustafabeily, Deputy for Iran and Afghanistan in the MFA's Second Asia Department who accompanied Shmatko to Iran, told us that it was time to pressure Iran.  The TRR proposal was a fair offer, but there was also a deadline that Iran had missed.  Commenting that the Iranians were "sly" and knew how to negotiate, he said that just last week Saeed Jalili, Secretary of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, had informed the Russian Ambassador in Tehran of Iran's new thinking on the TRR proposal.  If the West, including Russia, did not agree to a plan in which the IAEA would take "possession" of the low enriched uranium (LEU) while it remained on Iranian soil, it meant the West did not trust the IAEA.  Mustafabeily seemed exasperated by this thinking.  He also reported that Iran had conferred with (unnamed) other countries and determined that the enrichment proposed in the TRR proposal could be completed in five months rather than one year.  Mustafabeily said that Russia could not accomplish this process in five months, but said it was possible that others could.  4.  (C) Mustafabeily also remarked that he had met many members of the Iranian diaspora living in France.  Most were involved in business and kept one foot in France and the other in Iran.  While uniformly critical of the current Iranian regime, they also unanimously opposed sanctions as a way to influence Iran.  They believed sanctions would only harm average Iranians, not the elites.  Mustafabeily reported his own private conversations with businessmen in Tehran that confirmed this opinion.  --------------------------------------- S-300s:  Still Yellow Light on Transfer ---------------------------------------  5.  (C) On the issue of the S-300s, Mustafabeily reported that the Iranians had strongly criticized delays in the sale.  Specifically, the Iranian Ministers of Trade and Economic Development summoned Shmatko to discuss the S-300s and threatened legal action against the GOR to resolve the issue.  According to Mustafabeily, the Iranians reminded Shmatko that they had already paid a considerable amount towards delivery of the system and they expected fulfillment of the contract.  While Moscow was not considering a refund, GOR officials recognized the gravity of the issue and that Tehran was likely waiting for Russia's decision on sanctions before carrying out its threat of legal action.  Baranov said the decision on the Russian side would be made at the Presidential level, implying that the MFA was not involved in the discussions.  He did note that some in the GOR believed transferring the S-300s to Iran would increase stability in the region because Iran would feel more secure without developing nuclear weapons.  ----------------------- Anti-Russian Mood Grows -----------------------   MOSCOW 00003010  002 OF 003   6.  (C) Interestingly, Mustafabeily noticed an anti-Russian feeling in Iran, even to include unorchestrated demonstrations in front of their embassy in Tehran.  He commented that Russia was being criticized by the government and the elites for being too close to the West and for voting with Western countries in the IAEA.  Simultaneously, the Iranian opposition was also condemning Russia for working with the Iranian government.  Mustafabeily complained that the propaganda machine was working at full-speed in Iran.  7.  (C) Maxim Baranov, Director of the MFA's Iran Desk, said that Minister of Energy Shmatko's visit to Tehran was a chance to calm Iran's concerns about delays at the Bushehr facility and reduce rising tensions in the relationship.  He said that Russia planned to open the Bushehr reactor as soon as technical tests were completed and that confusion over dates had led to misstatements in the press.  Baranov claimed that Russia was continuing with technical testing and did not truly have an expected opening date.  Baranov acknowledged that Shmatko's visit came at a difficult time in the bilateral relationship, given Russia's recent vote at the IAEA.  He noted that, although Iran was upset about Russia's decision, Iranians would not directly "criticize a guest in their home."  As could be expected, Iranian officials instead expressed their disappointment through the media.  Baranov explained Russia's IAEA vote as an effort to signal Iran that Russia would no longer remain its unconditional supporter. He indicated that Moscow felt deceived by the Qom site. Baranov also took the opportunity to call for the U.S. to consult more closely with Russia on Iran and not limit discussions to like-minded countries.  8.  (C) Baranov claimed there was no clear signal coming from Tehran about if or when Iran would negotiate and who was in charge.  According to Baranov, Russia wanted Iran to understand that, while IAEA Director El Baradei had always tried to remain objective, there was no guarantee that the incoming director would follow this path.  El Baradei's proposal was a favorable deal that might not be available after he leaves his position.  Therefore, Russia was urging Iran to begin cooperation with the IAEA now on the TRR proposal.  When asked about Prime Minister Putin's recent statement that Russia had no information about a military dimension to Iran's nuclear program, Baranov seemed caught off guard.  He confided that backing up such a comment would be "complicated work."  -------------------------------------- Iran's Goal--Capability or Production? --------------------------------------  9.  (C) Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Yevseyev claimed that Russia's red line with Iran would be if/when Iran withdrew from the IAEA because this would demonstrate that Iran's intention was to build a nuclear weapon.  He believed that, because Iran was hoping to keep the LEU on its territory and needed an excuse to back away from the IAEA, its reaction to the vote was calculated and exaggerated. Nina Mamedova of the Oriental Studies Institute and Zhigun Yefim of the Middle East Institute agreed that Iran's reaction was overly emotional.  Mamedova claimed that Iran's reaction and subsequent announcement of plans to build 10 enrichment sites was meant to leave room for bargaining in the world community.  Iran was well known, according to Mamedova, for adopting harsh positions so there would be room for retreat.  She recalled that six years ago Iran reacted in the same way to an unfavorable IAEA resolution and threatened to build 20 nuclear power plants.  Then, when Iran realized that the isolation this decision produced was not helpful, it renewed cooperation.  She predicted that Iran would likely return to negotiations by early next year but did not know when exactly.  10.  (C) Vladimir Sazhin of the Oriental Studies Institute and commentator for the Voice of Russia claimed that Tehran's overall goal was completion of the fuel cycle and infrastructure to produce a nuclear weapon when they needed it.  He did not believe Tehran intended to assemble a weapon.  Merely having the capacity would be enough to satisfy its need for security and self-aggrandizement.  Conversely, both Mamedova and Yefim believed Iran's goal was to build a nuclear weapon rather than just develop the capability.  They believed Iran would not feel secure until it had a small number of nuclear weapons to defend itself against the "threat" from Israel.  ----------------- Influencing Iran -----------------  MOSCOW 00003010  003 OF 003    11.  (C) Although Russia had long considered Iran as a key element of regional stability, most Russian officials and analysts agreed that its ability to influence Iran was minimal and quickly decreasing.  Yevseyev pointed out that Italy and Germany had far greater trade turnover with Iran than Russia did.  Similarly, Mamedova lamented that the bilateral economic relationship was small, even speculating that rumors circulating about Iran's readiness to start joint new exploration efforts with Gazprom of possible gas fields were more likely empty promises meant to convince Russia to defend Iran's position in the international community.  12. (C) A carrot/stick approach was recommended by some observers.  Vladimir Sazhin said that any use of military force against Iran would cause catastrophe in the region or even globally.  He advocated balanced measures which included financial support to the oil and gas sector, a treaty between the P5 1 and Iran on security guarantees, and recognition of Iran's prominent role in the region.  If these failed to produce positive results, he believed sanctions against the banking and oil and gas sectors might be effective.  Yevseyev said the international community should remain flexible and strive for Iran's integration in to the global economic and political system when Iran demonstrates behaviors that are more positive.  Mamedova said it was critical that sanctions avoid inflicting suffering on average Iranians because this would only increase support for Iran's current behavior.  13. (C) Comment:  The varying perspectives within the Russian foreign policy establishment reflect competing interests. From a purely mercantilist standpoint, sanctions against Iran, particularly its energy sector, would likely translate into a bump in world oil prices, which would boost annual revenues for Russia's state-connected energy companies and the state budget by billions of dollars annually.  If sanctions harm Iran's burgeoning economic relationship with China, some in Russia might also regard that as a plus.  On the other hand, sanctions could damage Russia's own trade with Iran, which is modest (Russia currently has a bilateral trade surplus of about USD 3 billion) but concentrated in the politically-influential defense and atomic-energy sectors. Since many high-ranking officials in these agencies also favor a more adversarial policy towards the West, an anti-sanctions posture serves them both economically and ideologically.  The status quo is preferable for Russia and as the decision point approaches Moscow will probably search for an outcome that changes as little as possible.  Given the stakes for Russia's economy and its relations with the U.S., Israel and the EU, this decision will be made by both Medvedev and Putin, with implications for the domestic and foreign influence each exerts.

S E C R E T MOSCOW 000405  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV ETTC MCAP MARR MOPS PARM PINR PTERIR, RS SUBJECT: RUSSIA DELAYS DELIVERY OF S-300S TO IRAN?  REF: A. BEYRLE-BURNS FEBRUARY 18 E-MAIL      B. MOSCOW 357  Classified By: DCM Eric Rubin.  Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (S) In response to media reports surrounding the visit of Iranian Defense Minister Najar to Moscow February 16-18 that Russia would move ahead with the delivery of the S-300 air defense missile system to Iran, Ambassador expressed strong concern to DFM Ryabkov February 17 (ref A).  Ryabkov replied that Moscow had "gotten the message."  This followed Ambassador's demarches on the issue the previous week to Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Prikhodko and PM FP Advisor Ushakov, as well as U/S Burns' and NSC Senior Director McFaul's expressions of strong concern regarding the possible completion of the delivery with FM Lavrov (ref B), Prikhodko and Ushakov.  2. (SBU) Late February 17, news daily Kommersant reported that Rosoboronexport spokesman Vyacheslav Davidenko said that Russia and Iran were "unlikely to agree on deliveries of the S-300 air defense missile system" during Najar's visit. Davidenko reportedly said that "nothing has changed as to the deliveries of S-300 to Tehran" and that "things were unlikely to change" after Naijar's visit.  Press reports February 18 followed up, saying that Russia had "deferred" its plan to sell S-300's to Iran "in an effort to improve Moscow's relations with the new Obama Administration."  They cited Rosoboronexport General Director Isaikin's comment that "if the president and government of the Russian Federation make a decision, Rosoboronexport must implement it."  Isaikin said Russia had not delivered the system to Iran, but was ready to do so "if ordered."  Daily Izvestiya also reported that DFM Ryabkov said that Russia "saw to it that its military cooperation is transparent and in keeping with international law."  3. (C) Israeli DCM Yuval Fuchs told us February 17 that FM Lavrov was in Israel over the weekend and assured the GOI that Russia was not supplying any S-300 missiles to any countries in the Middle East.  According to Fuchs, Lavrov failed to give any heads up to the GOI about Najar's visit this week.  Fuchs added that Rosatom head Sergey Kiriyenko and Deputy FM Aleksey Borodavkin will make separate trips to Iran later this month.  Kiriyenko will travel to discuss Iran's nuclear facility at Bushehr, while Borodavkin is going for consultations.  4. (C) Comment.  Russian officials appear to have stepped back, at least temporarily, from announcing a delivery of the S-300's, but pressure will remain within the military and security services to move forward as much for financial reasons as for political or foreign policy considerations. The prospect of more constructive U.S.-Russian relations may have tempered the GOR response, but we will continue to be told that Russia retains its "right" to proceed with an arms sale that does not violate national or international regimes.  For better or for worse, the delivery of S-300's have become a barometer of our bilateral relations. BEYRLE

(SBU) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (37) is Germany's new and youngest-ever Economics Minister, assuming a portfolio for which he is not wholly suited academically (REF A) but which he could master using his proven personal and political skills. If he is successful, he could become the poster child for renewal of Horst Seehofer's Christian Social Union (CSU), now struggling to convince voters that it is modern and savvy enough to succeed and not the hide-bound regional redoubt of conservatism that lost big in Bavaria last fall (REF B).  (Biographical data at paragraph 8.)    End Summary.  2.  (SBU) Supporters and detractors focus on the same qualities in the precocious zu Guttenberg: his youth, charisma, foreign policy experience, and upward momentum.  Supporters say he will be effective because he understands modern challenges, is well known on both sides of the Atlantic, and is effective.  Detractors say he has too little experience in general and that his foreign policy expertise is wrong for the Economics Ministry during an economic crisis.  3.  (SBU) Zu Guttenberg has a proven record of beating the expectations of politicians and the public.  He unexpectedly contested and won the Chairmanship of the CSU in Upper Franconia, a region of Bavaria, in 2007. After becoming party general secretary just three months ago, he used warmth, charisma and direct engagement to win over party members in the provinces who were skeptical of his allegedly cool and aristocratic bearing (see bio notes below at paragraph 8).  ------------------------------------------ Politicians Curious; Private Sector Upbeat ------------------------------------------  4.   (SBU) Zu Guttenberg could add some gloss to the cabinet by concentrating in a high-profile way on the business side of the economy, leaving high finance to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party, SPD).  This might be a good strategy.  Senior contacts at the Bavarian Economics Ministry told the Consulate political specialist that "they are enthusiastic about zu Guttenberg."  Although he would not really have time to master the difficult ministry within the six months he has before the Federal Bundestag election, they believed zu Guttenberg was "smart, with a quick mind, and that he would definitely make himself far more visible than Glos ever did." Embassy contacts in Berlin have echoed these sentiments and think zu Guttenberg is well-suited to capitalize on opportunities with the new US Administration.  He seems to get on well with Chancellor Merkel.  Moreover, business representatives and the private sector have given the new man an early round of applause.  For example, Employers' Association President Dieter Hundt said zu Guttenberg's international experience, political clout, and contacts would all help him promote the interests of employers.  Representatives from Industry and Chambers of Commerce expressed the expectation that zu Guttenberg would support medium-sized business and strengthen transatlantic economic ties, based on his own experience in his family's enterprises.  Zu Guttenberg's tasks are manifold: Implementation of the savings package worth 100 billion Euros; negotiate with companies that have asked for state money, such as Continental and car manufacturer Opel; find a solution for Hypo Real Estate bank; and tackle a wealth of questions with regard to energy and ecology. Chancellor Merkel will want zu Guttenberg to strike a balance between being seen as a hands-on minister and preventing the election campaign from being fought over the financial crisis, something that could weaken Government prospects.  ---------------------------------------- THE NEW CSU - MORE ATTRACTIVE TO VOTERS? ----------------------------------------  5. (SBU) With this appointment, Bavarian Minister President Horst Seehofer, also CSU, extended his radical rejuvenation strategy of the party to the federal level.  Michael Glos was the last senior CSU politician from the preceding Edmund Stoiber generation.  "zu Guttenberg is young, very young - but that is exactly what I want in the process of renewal," said Seehofer.  The CSU faces potentially existential challenges in the races for the German Federal and European Parliaments and Seehofer obviously believes that only fresh faces can lead the party into a brighter future.  After taking office as Bavarian Minister President last fall, Seehofer replaced all members of the cabinet over 60 years of age with considerably  MUNICH 00000025  002 OF 002   younger people, including more women.  Seehofer's departure as Federal Agriculture Minister enabled him to install 44-year old Ilse Aigner as his successor. With zu Guttenberg gone to Berlin, Seehofer has appointed two from the younger CSU generation to replace him - Alexander Dobrindt, a relative unknown 38-year-old Bundestag deputy, and Dorothee Baer, the 30-year-old who was just recently promoted to foreign policy spokesperson of the CSU Bundestag caucus.  Seehofer knows that the June 7 European Parliament elections and the September 27 national elections are the tests to see whether Bavarians go along with his new CSU.  ------- Comment -------  7.  (SBU) The SPD may hope to profit from the replacement of Michael Glos with the relatively inexperienced zu Guttenberg; this may prove difficult.  Glos was from the start considered one of Merkel's weakest ministers, and his departure removes a favorite target of his political opponents.  It will be far more difficult to score points by attacking his successor, who is a skilled debater.  In the middle of a serious economic and financial crisis, zu Guttenberg's challenge will be to convince the electorate in Germany that the CDU/CSU remains the party best able to cope with economic challenges.  It may not hurt that the new CSU Secretary General, Alexander Dobrindt, has previously served as economic spokesman of the CSU caucus.  The economy will no doubt be the overriding issue in the unfolding election campaign.  --------------------------------------------- ---------- Biographical Data: Germany's Youngest Minister, a Baron --------------------------------------------- ----------  8.  The 37-year-old Karl-Theodor von und zu Guttenberg was CSU Secretary General for only 100 days.  His nomination to Federal Economics Minister had not been on his agenda; however, he said, it was "an honor he could not reject." zu Guttenberg, descendent of a nobility line dating back to the year 1149, comes from a family with a strong political background: His grandfather was a Parliamentarian State Secretary under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, his father is a famous conductor, and his grand-uncle supported NS resistance fighter Count von Stauffenberg and was executed by the Nazis.  His father left the CSU when then-Minister President Streibl cancelled his participation in a demonstration against anti-Semitism (he later rejoined the party).  Zu Guttenberg is a man of considerable rhetorical skills, which in 2007 resulted in his election to CSU district chairman of Upper Franconia over his rival, party whip Hartmut Koschyk.  Ever since he became a member of the Bundestag in 2002, he has proven a quick study, making himself a name as foreign and security policy expert.  He draws from a rich network of international contacts, in Europe as well as in the U.S.  Right before the February 6-8 Munich Security Conference, he chaired a roundtable on foreign policy issues, attended, among others, by Special Representative Richard Holbrooke, Deputy Secretary James Steinberg, and USNATO Ambassador Kurt Volker.  He is not without an economic background.  For a few years, he worked as investment banker in New York; until 2002, he served as managing director of a family business.  He also helped prepare a medium-sized company, Rhoen Hospitals, to enter the stock market.  He speaks fluent English.  His wife, Stephanie, is also of noble lineage.  They have two daughters.

(SBU) The Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria has celebrated the outcome of the federal coalition negotiations, which awarded the party with three ministries and several state secretary positions. The outcome appears to have reinvigorated Horst Seehofer, Bavarian Minister President and head of the CSU, recovering from a bout with the flu and worse-than-expected results in the September 27 national elections.  Singling out newly sworn-in Defense Minister zu Guttenberg for praise, Seehofer expects him to compete successfully for world attention with new Foreign Minister and FDP chairman Westerwelle.  Seehofer has signaled that he expects to be working with the FDP for a long time.  End Summary.  CSU Thrilled with Coalition Negotiations Results --------------------------------------------- ---  2.  (SBU) "We could not be more satisfied with the outcome," Michael Hohenberger, a senior State Chancery contact told us October 28, adding that "even with a better election result the CSU could hardly have emerged stronger in the new cabinet."  Although some Bavarian observers have deplored the fact that the CSU lost ministerial posts in financial and economic affairs at the Federal level, all agree that having Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Defense Minister is a very positive development.  A CSU party senior advisor, Christian Kattner, told us privately on the same day that he could "understand Chancellor Merkel's point in giving the Finance Ministry at this difficult time to an experienced man like (former Interior Minister) Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union ) CDU) rather than to a young man at the beginning of his political career." 3.  (C) Kattner insisted that the CSU had left its mark with regard to substance.  M-P Seehofer had promised tax cuts, which are now in the works, and aid measures for farmers, for which he obtained an agreement on public aid amounting to 700 million Euros.  The CDU/CSU stood united in rejecting FDP demands they considered too business friendly at the expense of social justice concerns, he said.  Bavarian Justice Minister Merk, who at the beginning of the coalition negotiations expressed concerns about FDP "weaknesses" on internal security and counterterrorism, told the CG October 27 that "she was very comfortable with the results." Strong CSU Bavarian Line-Up in Berlin -------------------------------------  4.  (SBU) As for the Cabinet, in addition to zu Guttenberg at Defense, there is Peter Ramsauer heading the Transportation Ministry, where he will have national influence and a huge budget.  Ilse Aigner (CSU) remains Minister of Agriculture. Five of the the parliamentarian State Secretaries are Bavarian, four from the CSU r and one from the FDP.  This gives the CSU and Bavaria generally important influence at the sub-Cabinet level and sets up influential and direct Bavarian connections between the Bundestag and Cabinet.  In the Defense Ministry, well-respected Christian Schmidt retained his position, as did Gerd Mueller in Agriculture. Hartmut Koschyk moves to the Finance Ministry, providing the CSU with important direct influence with Minister Schaeuble. The 35-year old Andreas Scheuer from Passau will assist Peter Ramsauer at the Transportation Ministry.  The fifth Bavarian is Max Stadler (FDP), who will support Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) at the Justice Ministry.  A well-respected lawyer from Passau, Stadler is an excellent choice and a real legal expert with American experience as a 1993 International Visitor Program alumnus. Seehofer Expects Long-Term Cooperation with FDP --------------------------------------------- --  5.  (SBU) At the CSU party convention on October 26, where the coalition agreement was approved, MP Seehofer made clear that the CSU,s main rival will now be the FDP, "which no longer is a small party but clearly intends to become a people,s party," he said, predicting "they will be targeting the same voters as the CSU."  The CSU, he added, will have to act as the guardian of the little people "to ensure that  MUNICH 00000273  002 OF 002   social justice prevails."  Later, upon signing the coalition agreement in Berlin, Seehofer indicated that he intends to remain in the CSU leadership.  Noting that this was the second time he had signed an agreement with the FDP, following the agreement in Bavaria one year earlier, he said he might be able to do the same again for the third and fourth time in 2013.  The media jumped on this statement since it insinuated that Seehofer had given up hope of  the CSU regaining its absolute majority in the 2013 Bavarian state elections.  "This statement might come back to haunt him," one journalist commented.  Comment -------  6.  (C) Bavarian leaders are strong at home and in Berlin. Contrary to media speculation, Horst Seehofer remains uncontested as CSU chairman and Bavarian Minister-President. Our contacts in the party, State Chancery and CSU caucus unanimously rejected speculation about an imminent revolt against his leadership, although several acknowledge there will be discussions of a possible change in 2011 in preparation for the next Bavarian election in 2013.  In the capital, Defense Minister zu Guttenberg will be a serious competitor to Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the diplomatic parquet.  In foreign and security affairs, zu Guttenberg is better connected in Washington, fluent in English, and more experienced in the key issues.  Moreover, his good relations with the USG, which started in Bavaria, extend beyond the Department of State to the Department of Defense and Congress, notably through the vehicle of the annual Munich Security Conference (next iteration February 5-7, 2010), where he is a regular and prominent organizer and participant.

REF: A. BERLIN 1601      B. MUNICH 324  Classified By: Consul General Conrad Tribble for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d )  SUMMARY -------  1.   (C) Support within Chancellor Merkel,s partner Christian Social Union (CSU) for sending more German troops to Afghanistan is not a sure thing.  CSU chief and Bavarian Minister President  Seehofer, rattled German policy makers nationwide when he told Bild on December 7 that he had "little sympathy" for increasing the number of German soldiers sent to Afghanistan and that "someone would have to convince him of a clear alternative" and "any further German engagement had to be linked to a clear exit strategy."  CSU insiders privately regretted Seehofer's remarks, but the CSU General Secretary told us that it reflected realistic thinking.  Edmund Stoiber (ex-CSU chairman and ex-Minister President) acknowledged December 10 that the CSU was not automatically a firm U.S. ally on this question but said he expected all federal coalition parties to "live up to their responsibility" and take the right decision following the January 28 Afghanistan conference.  However, if he is wrong and there are significant defectors in either the CSU or the FDP, it will be difficult for even supportive SPD and Green parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised mandate. End Summary.  SEEHOFER MIGHT ECHO POPULAR CONCERNS ------------------------------------  2.  (C) Echoing concerns expressed privately by some Consulate contacts, many commentators reacted badly to the December 7 timing of Seehofer's skeptical Afghanistan remarks.  They accused him of populist posturing while Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, also CSU, was under intense political pressure for the Kunduz tanker bombing, Ambassador Holbrooke was in Germany to receive the Augsburg University Peace Prize, and President Obama was heading to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. However, others acknowledged that Seehofer reflected "proper concerns" and that Germany "needed to deliberate as carefully as the U.S. had done before committing new troops."  State Chancellery and Ministry officials, including the State Secretary for Federal and European Issues, told the Consul General in a private meeting on December 8 they were "embarrassed by Seehofer's remarks" and suggested he had reacted "like a populist" to recent opinion polls that showed 69 percent of Germans opposed sending more German soldiers to Afghanistan.  (NOTE: Another recent poll reported that 69 percent favored immediate withdrawal.)  A CSU contact called us that same morning from party headquarters to express his frustration over Seehofer who had "once again not consulted anybody before giving his two cents."  In contrast to this, CSU Secretary General Alexander Dobrindt told CG Tribble on December 8 that Seehofer's statement was by no means new but reflected "common CSU thinking."  Seehofer had "said this many times before," he insisted, without producing proof.  AFGHAN ENTANGLEMENTS SPOOK THE CSU ----------------------------------  3.  (C) The CSU and Bavaria have a well-documented aversion to sensitive engagements in Afghanistan.  The CSU has refused to accept any of the 17 Uighurs to be released from Guantanamo, even though Munich is home to an estimated 500 Uighurs, the largest Uigher community in Germany.  Bavaria resisted for over a year all entreaties to send police trainers to Afghanistan; the  first Bavarian police trainers just left in November after a change of heart by the Interior Minister.  CSU Bundestag deputy Peter Gauweiler, together with his CDU colleague Willy Wimmer, appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court in March 2007 to rule against German Tornado reconnaissance aircraft "assisting the U.S. in a mission in Afghanistan that was violating international law." In October 2008, Gauweiler again voted against German ISAF  MUNICH 00000328  002 OF 002   engagement.  While Gauweiler is generally seen as an outsider within the CSU party caucus, he may have some secret followers.  Another CSU Bundestag deputy, Thomas Silberhorn, said in October that the debate on Afghanistan "should not be limited to discussing more and more foreign soldiers but rather appealing on Afghanistan's own responsibility."  CHANCELLOR NEEDS TO WORK HARDER TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC --------------------------------------------- ---------  4.  (C) On December 10, Ambassador Murphy called on Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian Minister President from 1993 to 2007 and CSU party chairman from 1999 to 2007.  Stoiber praised the new U.S. Administration and President Obama's "courageous and honest" speeches in West Point and Oslo.  He reminded the Ambassador how German engagement in and responsibility for two world wars had "left marks of deep trauma on the German people."  The largest demonstrations ever, he recalled, occurred in the fifties when over one million Germans protested German rearmament.  The decision to support the NATO two-track decision in the early 1990,s even led to the resignation of Helmut Schmidt, one of Germany's most popular chancellors.  Stoiber said he did not expect any new insights from the January 28 London Afghanistan conference, but he expressed the hope that all parties of the federal government coalition would live up to their responsibilities.  In order to get broad CSU support, the leadership had to develop a realistic exit strategy as President Obama had showed the way with his 2011 target for the United States.  Stoiber said he had much confidence in Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) who was politically well-connected, an expert on foreign policy, and sensitive for what had to be done.  However, he called on Chancellor Merkel to start a "public relations initiative" aimed at explaining to the German public why these operations were so vital for German security interests.  At the same time, Stoiber predicted the SPD and Greens would "return to their anti-war propaganda." Leaders like Gerhard Schroeder and Joschka Fischer had left the political scene, and ex-Foreign Minister Steinmeier was about to get marginalized in the new SPD.  COMMENT -------  5. (C) At the Consulate in Munich, we heard unprompted, mostly negative, reactions from CSU leadership and working level operatives around Seehofer to his skeptical remarks concerning Germany's Afghanistan troop levels.  However,  it is clear that the CSU is on the fence and remains to be convinced about the need or wisdom of sending additional troops,  especially combat troops as opposed to troops sent to train the Afghan National Army or to provide force protection for police mentoring teams.  He may be accurately reflecting the opinion of a skeptical German public that "wants to take its time, just like the United States' President did."  Embassy Berlin observes that unanimous or near unanimous support from the CSU is critical to Chancellor Merkel's goal of obtaining a broad majority in the Bundestag for a revised ISAF mandate after the London Conference.  If there are significant defectors in either the CSU or the FDP, where there is also significant skepticism about a troop increase, it will be difficult for even supportive SPD and Green parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised mandate.  6.

Allegrone, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C/NF) European Union members will send low-ranking diplomats to the first of two inauguration ceremonies for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but they will not inform the Iranians of their plans, according to French MFA Acting Middle East Director (Assistant-Secretary equivalent) Jean-Christophe Paucelle.  If the Iranians find out beforehand that the EU will not send Ambassador-level representation, Paucelle told poloff early July 31, then they may rescind the invitations to the August 3 event, as they did in similar circumstances prior to former President Khatami's inauguration in 1997. "It's hard to keep a secret when 27 nations are involved," Paucelle noted, "but we are trying."  Only the Swedish EU Presidency will be represented by an Ambassador, Paucelle said.  2.  (C/NF) All EU members will, however, send their Ambassadors to the August 5 inauguration ceremony in the Iranian Parliament.  Paucelle adopted a defensive tone when explaining this decision, which he said was finalized in Brussels the morning of July 31.  He admitted this issue had generated tense and fractious debate among European foreign ministers.  "We are caught between two conflicting objectives," Paucelle explained.  "On the one hand, we want to communicate that we do not approve of this illegitimate election.  On the other hand, we need to be realistic: the power is in the hands of Khameini and Ahmadinejad, including the nuclear file, and we must negotiate with those in power. You are in the same position."  Paucelle insisted that the EU will continue to respect what he described as "the Durban red lines."  "We will walk right out if Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust or declares that his regime will destroy Israel." (NOTE: Paucelle admitted that since non-Muslims had never before received an invitation to the inauguration ceremony presided over by the Supreme Leader, EU diplomats in Tehran have never entered the building where the event will take place, and so they are not sure how they will stage their walk-out, logistically, should they need to do so.  They are worried that the doors may be locked.  END NOTE.)  Paucelle also reported that the German Ambassador will return from his vacation on August 4 to ensure that he will miss the first ceremony and attend the second one along with his EU counterparts.  The British Ambassador will attend as well, even without credentials.  "The Iranians are desperate for recognition and so they have disregarded their usual devotion to protocol -- and their anti-British vitriol -- on this occasion."  3.  (C/NF) Paucelle said that the case of detained French citizen Clothilde Reiss has also influenced the EU decision to attend the inauguration ceremonies.  "We think she may be released soon, and we don't want to create another irritant," Paucelle said.  "There are enough already."  He reported that the French have reason to believe Reiss may form part of a group of detainees likely to be released on the August 7 anniversary of Imam Mahdi.  Paucelle noted that a letter released July 29 by Ahmadinejad supported the idea of granting clemency to post-election protesters during Mahdi celebrations.  "The Iranians will need to take face-saving measures, and so she will likely transfer to house arrest or some other status," Paucelle said.  He added that, of course, she may not be released at all next week, but the French remain optimistic that she will soon be out of prison. PEKALA
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 PARIS 001254  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/16/2018 TAGS: PREL PARM KNNP BH SM MK GR FRSUBJECT: A/S GORDON'S MEETINGS WITH POLICY-MAKERS IN PARIS: A TOUR D'HORIZON OF EUROPE AND AFGHANISTAN  Classified By: Ambassador Charles Rivkin, for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).  1.  (S) Summary.  During Assistant Secretary Gordon's visit to Paris on September 11, he met with a number of French policy-makers including: Elysee Diplomatic Advisors Jean-David Levitte, Damien Loras, and Francois Richier, Assistant Secretary equivalent for Continental Europe Roland Galharague, and Acting Director of MFA Strategic Affairs bureau Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel.  Discussions focused on Russia, upcoming developments in the Balkans (Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Kosovo), elections in Germany and Afghanistan, Turkey's EU Accession, NATO Enlargement and Strategic Concept, and Georgia and Ukraine.  End Summary.  ------------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: A MAJOR PRIORITY -------------------------------------  2.  (C) Jean-David Levitte noted that while public opinion in France is opposed to the war in Afghanistan, the situation here is much calmer than in the UK, Germany, or Italy. Angela Merkel's domestic political situation after the incident in Kunduz was particularly fragile, so that was part of the rationale behind the recent German-French-UK letter to UN SYG Ban Ki Moon to propose an international conference on Afghanistan by the end of the year.  Levitte said that the goal of the conference would be to accelerate and improve the training of Afghan troops and police and to strengthen Afghan state institutions, which will help reinforce the importance of the international effort to skeptical publics.  They are now waiting for Ban Ki Moon's response.  Levitte emphasized that France remains "totally engaged" in Afghanistan with no limits or caveats on its troops.  This autumn, France will complete a transfer of troops from Kabul to Kapisa and Surobi provinces (a presence that will be reinforced on the ground as France reassigns some sailors to other regional activities and replaces them with ground troops).  A/S Gordon assured Levitte that the U.S. would soon be able to share the elements of the McChrystal military review with Allies. Levitte responded by praising General McChrystal and saying that French forces have an excellent dialogue with him on the ground.  He added that Germany and the UK are determined to stay in Afghanistan as needed, but we may need to convince the Netherlands to remain, and that President Sarkozy had recently reinforced this message in a meeting with Dutch PM Balkenende.  ------------------------------------------- BOSNIA: FRENCH URGE TRANFER TO EU AUTHORITY -------------------------------------------  3.  (C) Levitte noted that of the five major conditions required to transfer authority in Bosnia from the UN High Representative to an EU High Representative, four have been fulfilled, and only the question of division of state property remains.  This final condition should not alone "block all progress," especially as the current UN team in Bosnia is no longer effective.  France wants to see the transfer of authority to a new EU team in November, as the rapprochement to Europe is an effective "carrot" to encourage the Bosniaks to continue progress in necessary reforms.  A/S Gordon agreed that the current system is not working well, but noted that the international community will lose credibility if we move forward before all the necessary pre-conditions have been fulfilled.  He added that the U.S. agrees that some form of carrot is necessary to urge Bosnian compliance.  Levitte noted that they still have two months to urge Bosnian progress before a final decision is made.  In a separate meeting, Assistant Secretary equivalent for Continental Europe Roland Galharague said that "transition is the number one objective," suggested the division of state property will take much time to resolve, and urged the U.S. to support early transfer of authority that would open the door to Bosnian aspirations for greater integration into EU institutions.  He noted that the growing perception of divisions between the US and Bosniaks on one side who favored retaining the UN role and the EU and Serbs on the other created unhelpful opportunities for manipulation.  A/S Gordon said this perception was inaccurate, but noted the U.S. is sensitive to the political need for Bosniak leaders to sell this decision to their publics.  The USG needs to see a clear path ahead for transition in order to support it.  ----------------------------------------- KOSOVO AND SERBIA -----------------------------------------  4.  (C) Levitte noted that the EULEX mission is having diplomatic problems with the Kosovar government and public  PARIS 00001254  002 OF 004   after signing two technical protocols with Serbia.  They are hoping to ensure continued calm as Kosovo heads into municipal elections.  A/S Gordon stated that the Kosovars will have to accept the protocols but that it should be clearly explained that these are technical agreements that have no impact on Kosovo's independent status.  Levitte also criticized Serbian FM Jeremic, saying that he is doing nothing to encourage Serb return or participation in Kosovo's government.  Levitte noted that Jeremic "makes big promises" every time he comes to France, but doesn't follow through. Levitte no longer meets with him and does not consider him to be the "modern face of Belgrade" that he purports to be.  ----------------------------------------- MACEDONIA AND CROATIA -----------------------------------------  5.  (C) Levitte expressed optimism that a new Greek government would be "more solid" and allow greater flexibility for progress in the Greek-Macedonian name dispute.  A/S Gordon agreed that either a more solid Conservative government or a Socialist government would be a stronger, more flexible partner in the negotiations.  He expressed hope that if the international community could convince Macedonia to abandon the idea of a referendum and get Greece to abandon the necessity of changing passports, then progress could be made.  On Croatia, Levitte observed that the border issue with Slovenia is making progress.  He hoped that the upcoming September elections in Germany would also allow the new German government to be more open to EU enlargement to include the Balkan countries.  Paris wants the door to enlargement to remain open, even if the accession process takes time.  ---------------------------------------- CONCERNS ABOUT TURKEY ----------------------------------------  6.  (C) Levitte informed A/S Gordon that there had been no change in the French position advocating a "privileged partnership" between the European Union and Turkey, in lieu of EU membership.  However, he emphasized that France was not preventing accession negotiations from progressing on all the EU chapters that do not pre-suppose membership.  There remain plenty of chapters of the acquis to open, so if progress is not being made, the fault lies with Turkish intransigence on Cyprus.  Unfortunately, Ankara is not completing the required necessary reforms and progress has stalled.  Levitte anticipated a negative report this fall on Turkey's failure to fulfill the Ankara Protocol.  A/S Gordon said that Turkey was caught in a vicious cycle and it is not completing necessary reforms because the Turks do not believe that their EU candidacy will be allowed to progress, and at the same time, their negotiations are not progressing because they aren't completing the required reforms.  He noted that in the latest German Marshall Fund polls in Turkey, fewer that 30% of the Turkish public believes they will succeed in getting EU membership.  7.  (C) Levitte agreed, but noted that Paris hopes that it will be the Turks themselves who realize that their role is best played as a bridge between the two worlds of Europe and Asia, rather than anchored in Europe itself.  He stated that Turkey is in a difficult position as it wants to enter the EU but has refused to accept one of the other EU member states. Levitte predicted that a worse case scenario would be if Turkey finally manages to complete the acquis and end negotiations and a public referendum is held in France which is finally opposed to their membership.  Despite all of these problems, Levitte claimed that President Sarkozy is a friend of Turkey and has visited the country at least 10 times in his life.  ----------------------------------------- RUSSIA AND GEORGIA -----------------------------------------  8.  (C)  A/S Gordon described the challenges and frustrations of the U.S.- Russia relationship, which is based on finding areas where we can work together on our common interest.  He noted progress at the July summit meeting on such issues as START talks and transfer of lethal material through Russia to Afghanistan.  Galharague described Russia as a state with the trappings of democracy but without any mechanisms for the public to influence government decision-making.  "The root of the problem is the regime," he said.  Presidential advisor Loras added Russian leaders lacked sufficient, long-range vision for their country and instead, focused on a six-month time horizon and their business interests.  Galharague  PARIS 00001254  003 OF 004   described the French strategy as finding a balance between treating Russia as if it is too important or treating it like an enemy. The French observed that some in Russia have concluded their interests are served by keeping the west "tied down in an Afghanistan quagmire" and by sustaining the status quo in Iran.  He elaborated that a solution that thwarts Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions and restores Iran as a normal member of the international community could undermine Russian regional and energy interests.  Loras noted of late the Russians have been unhelpful on Iran.   Moreover, they appear to have concluded they can pocket a projected U.S. decision to scale back or abandon the Bush administration's Missile Defense initiative without paying any cost.  9.  (C) Looking ahead on the energy front, Loras predicted that substantial Russian under-investment in energy extraction infrastructure was such that Russia would not be able to meet European demand in four or five years.  He observed this created an opportunity for Russia to have even more leverage over a Europe that has not prepared to diversify its energy supplies. In response to a question on Russia's decision to suspend negotiations on World Trade Organization membership in favor of a customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus,  A/S Gordon replied the U.S. would continue a policy review on Missile Defense to take the right decision based on the merits.   On Russian actions regarding the WTO, he said that Moscow's decision was likely supported by Russians whose interests were not advanced by opening markets.  Galharague observed that failure to advance WTO membership for Russia had negative implications for EU-Russian trade relations as progress in this EU effort pre-supposed progress on Russian accession to the WTO. Loras reported the coming year will involve substantial Franco-Russian interactions.  This engagement would include a visit by French Prime Minister Fillon to Russia in September, a visit to France by Putin in November, a state visit to France by Medvedev in March, and a Sarkozy visit to Russia in 2010 on the margins of the St. Petersburg forum.  These visits would occur under the auspices of reciprocal "Year of France" events in Russia and "Year of Russia" events in France.   10.  (C) Levitte and A/S Gordon discussed the "dangerous" precedent of ships being intercepted in Georgian waters. Sarkozy Advisor Damien Loras noted that President Saakashvili has a French advisor who has informed Paris that Georgian ships have orders to respond if fired upon.  This can escalate and the French message has been to emphasize that Georgia must not respond to provocation, as that would only play into Russia's hands.  Levitte stressed the importance of maintaining the Geneva process, while noting that it may take a generation before the Russian public will be able to accept their loss of influence, from Poland and the Baltics to Ukraine and Georgia.  Unfortunately, the Russian tendency is to view "good neighbors" as totally submissive subordinates. On the other hand, Paris is closely watching Medvedev, who is more frequently taking public stances in opposition to Putin.  Medvedev is more open to the occidental powers and more open to modernization and rule of law issues that Russia must face.  A/S Gordon observed that President Obama had spent a good deal of time with Medvedev on his trip to Russia, and had specifically targeted Russian youth in his public outreach event.  In his meeting with Galharague and others, A/S Gordon noted that the U.S. pursues a policy to support Georgia in the face of Russian pressure without encouraging President Saakashvili to act in ways that are unhelpful.  ----------------------------------------- IRAN: NEXT STEPS -----------------------------------------  11.  (S/NF)  Levitte noted that the Iranian response to the overture of President Obama and the West was "a farce," although Russia had received it as a real initiative.  The current Iranian regime is effectively a fascist state and the time has come to decide on next steps.  Levitte stated that this is why Paris is advocating a meeting of the EU3 PLUS 3 on the margins of the Pittsburgh G20 meeting.  The French hope to approve a two-paragraph statement laying out next steps on negotiations or sanctions.  He noted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel shares the view of the French President and is willing to be firm on sanctions, but that FM Steinmeier was more cautious.  The Iranian regime must understand that it will be more threatened by economic harm and the attendant social unrest than it would be by negotiating with the West.  Unfortunately, the P-3 cannot remain passive until Russia and China finally lose patience;  PARIS 00001254  004 OF 004   this is why a high-level political meeting is important to advance this discussion (and Levitte cited President Sarkozy's frank and direct style, saying that he would pinpoint Medvedev to explain his position).  Levitte said that he informed the Chinese FM that if they delay until a possible Israeli raid, then the world will have to deal with a catastrophic energy crisis as well.  At the same time, the debate over stopping the flow of gasoline into Iran will be very sensitive and would have to take into account which countries would be only too willing to step in and replace European companies.  Levitte informed us that they would like President Sarkozy to talk to President Obama by telephone in the coming days to discuss the G20 and Iran.  The French are proposing two possible windows to schedule the call.  ---------------------------------------- NATO'S ENLARGEMENT AND STRATEGIC CONCEPT ----------------------------------------  12.  (C) Levitte said that France was very pleased with the selection of Madeleine Albright to chair the "Group of 12," which will launch the process of reviewing NATO's Strategic Concept.  Bruno Racine will be the French participant on the panel, and Levitte stressed that there is already strong agreement between France and the United States on the basis of exchanges that he has had with NSA General Jim Jones. Levitte noted that Paris agreed with Jones on suppressing the Membership Action Plan (MAP), which had become an obstacle rather than an incentive.  A/S Gordon responded that we must not change the process in a way that would be interpreted as suggesting an end to NATO enlargement and eliminating MAP might do that.  Levitte agreed and added that French President Sarkozy was "convinced" that Ukraine would one day be a member of NATO, but that there was no point in rushing the process and antagonizing Russia, particularly if the Ukrainian public was largely against membership.  The Bucharest summit declaration was very clear that NATO has an open door and Ukraine and Georgia have a vocation in NATO (even if Georgia remains very unstable at the moment). Levitte added that Paris was very pleased with the ceremony on September 9 transferring the Allied Command Transformation (ACT) to French General Stephane Abrial.  -------------------------------- VENEZUELA --------------------------------  13.  (C) Levitte observed that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is "crazy" and said that even Brazil wasn't able to support him anymore.  Unfortunately, Chavez is taking one of the richest countries in Latin America and turning it into another Zimbabwe.  14.  (U) Assistant Secretary Gordon has cleared this message. RIVKIN

(SBU) In response to delivery of USG non-paper on U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense in Europe, Czech MFA Political Director Ivo Sramek noted that he is pleased that we are having an ongoing dialogue and that we are all examining ways to advance U.S.-Czech strategic collaboration.  He did not have substantive comments on the paper on October 1, although he noted that the MFA is collaborating with the MoD to flesh out the September 17 paper "Beyond the Missile Defense Review - The Way Forward in Strategic Cooperation." Sramek noted that this coming paper will add greater detail and specificity to the original paper the Czechs handed over.  He also noted that he would be discussing it on October 2 with FM Kohout and that they hope to be able to provide it to us early next week.  He noted that the approach in this coming paper is in keeping with the Kohout-S dialogue in New York on the UNGA margins, where the Secretary encouraged the Czechs to "think broadly" about cooperation and not simply to focus on military cooperation.  2. (C) Following this meeting, MFA Political Director Ivan Pocuch told emboff that within the MFA and MoD this paper was ready last week to hand over and that it was quite detailed and focused on the strategic relationship.  This paper, however, was held up by FM Kohout who felt that it was much too narrowly focused.  Pocuch and his Deputy, Petr Chalupecky, plan to press hard for this paper to be clearly prioritized and focused before it is handed over to us.  He also stated that from his point of view it is most important that we know that the Czechs wish to be involved in a substantive way in this new security architecture, however it evolves.  3. (SBU) Separately Defense Attache Wally Scales met with MoD Director of Security Policy Ivan Dvorak and delivered this paper.  According to Colonel Scales, Dvorak commented on the High Level Defense Group meeting to note that the first week of November was fine for the Czechs and that they hoped to see USG participation at the level of Under Secretary of Defense Flournoy.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 000181  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2019 TAGS: PARM PREL MARR MNUC IR SA RUSUBJECT: SAUDI EXCHANGE WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PLANS  Classified By: P/M COUNSELOR SCOTT MCGEHEE REASONS 1.4 (b) (d).  1. (C) SUMMARY & COMMENT:  Netherlands Ambassador Ron Strikker, Russian Ambassador Victor Gibinvish, and Embassy Riyadh Pol/Mil Counselor Scott McGehee met on January 25 with Dr. Prince Turki Al-Kabeer, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to deliver a joint demarche on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT).  The meeting evolved into a pointed exchange between the Russian Ambassador and Dr. Prince Turki on Iran's nuclear ambitions.  Prince Turki warned that if Iran tried to produce nuclear weapons, other countries in the Gulf region would be compelled to do the same, or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the Gulf to serve as a deterrent to the Iranians.  Turki then pointedly demanded that the US keep Saudi officials informed about US plans for Iran.  2. (C) Dr. Prince Turki is not a decision-maker, but he is a reliable transmitter of official Saudi thinking.  Most of what he said is not new, although this is the most explicit mention we have heard of Saudi willingness to see nuclear weapons deployed in the GCC as a deterrent to Iran.  His concern that the United States will negotiate a "grand bargain" with Iran without consulting Saudi Arabia is a concern we have heard often in recent weeks. End summary & comment.  3. (C) After hearing a brief verbal demarche from Ambassador Strikker on the upcoming June Plenary of the GICNT, Dr. Turki turned to Ambassador Gibinvish, saying, "On this issue, what concerns us most is how to get our neighbor to change its policy on enrichment." Iran needs to be convinced to enter a dialogue on this matter, he continued, noting that Saudi Arabia is also concerned about the Russian-built reactor at Bushehr.  A leakage from a plant at that location could bring an environmental catastrophe to Saudi Arabia, pointing out that it is located less than 300 kilometers away from Saudi shores, across open water.  4. (C) Ambassador Gibinvish was able to say only "Sure, I agree!" before Prince continued, "The location is so dangerous! Not just to us, but to the world economy!"  He urged that Russia use its influence to have the reactor moved north, suggesting that a location on the shore of the Caspian Sea would be much better, where there is water available for reactor cooling, and where mountains rise behind to contain any possible leakage from moving south.  Perhaps more troubling, he said, is Iran's pursuit of nuclear enrichment. He explained that if Iran tries to produce nuclear weapons, other countries in the Gulf region would be compelled to do the same, or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the Gulf to serve as a deterrent to the Iranians.  5. (C) Amb. Gibinvish responded that Iran's desire to enrich uranium reflected its fears that it will someday be attacked by Israel or the United States and also a sign of Iran's desire to establish its "supremacy" in the region.  Prince Turki interjected:  "And we cannot accept Iranian supremacy in the region.  We are okay with nuclear electrical power and desalination, but not with enrichment."  He said that the prospect of Iranian enrichment raises troubling questions about their motivations for doing so: "they do not need it!"  6. (S) Amb. Gibinvish noted that "some experts in Russia believe that Iran will have a bomb in 10 to 15 years." Russia, he said, is concerned about this matter as well, and has "put forward initiatives" with Iran.  Russia hopes to discuss this further with Saudi Arabia in the near future, and he said that an "important delegation" would be coming to Riyadh in about two months to discuss this with the Saudi leadership.  Prince Turki said that the Russian delegation would be welcomed, stressing that "we must work together to get them to abandon their effort to acquire nuclear weapons. Israel too, he said, must be convinced to surrender its nuclear arsenal.  But you deal with them, you have influence, that is why I raise this with you."  Amb. Gibinvish pledged that "we will do what we can.  But the Iranians are difficult partners."  At this point, Prince Turki turned to Pol/Mil Counselor who had momentarily stopped taking notes.  Prince Turki said "Please write this down. Whatever is discussed with the Iranians, we must be kept informed!  Any  RIYADH 00000181  002 OF 002   negotiations with the Iranians must take into account the interests of Saudi Arabia, otherwise, we will not accept it! We should be told -- in advance! -- of what you plan to say."  RUNDELL
S E C R E T RIYADH 000447   NSC FOR JBRENNAN AND JDUNCAN; STATE FOR S/WCI  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/16/2019 TAGS: PREL PTER KWBG SA AF IN PK IR IZSUBJECT: COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISER BRENNAN'S MEETING WITH SAUDI KING ABDULLAH  REF: RIYADH 427   Classified By: Pol Counselor Lisa Carle, 1.4(b),(d)  1.  KEY POINTS  -- (S) Saudi King Abdullah welcomed White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan, S/WCI Ambassador Williamson, and Ambassador Fraker to his private palace March 15 for a 90-minute discussion focused on U.S. Saudi-relations, counterterrorism cooperation, the Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainees, Iran, and Iraq.  -- (S) Brennan presented the King with a letter from President Obama expressing a personal message of friendship, appreciation for our close and collaborative relationship and concern over the disposition of Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo.  -- (S) The King said he had told Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki only minutes before that Iran should stop interfering in Arab affairs, and had given Iran a one-year deadline to improve its relations with Saudi Arabia.  -- (S) The King expressed a complete lack of trust in Iraqi PM al-Maliki and held out little hope for improved Saudi/Iraqi relations as long as al-Maliki remains in office.  -- (S) When asked what advice he had for President Obama, the King said he had "one request":  that it was "critically important to restore America's credibility" in the world.  U.S. SAUDI RELATIONS  2.  (S) PLEDGES OF FRIENDSHIP:  Brennan asserted that the U.S./Saudi alliance must remain strong, and assured the King of President Obama's wishes for a long and healthy U.S./Saudi relationship, and the President's personal commitment that Saudi Arabia had a friend in the White House.  The King replied that he appreciated the sentiments and that he had great respect for President Obama.  "We (the U.S. and Saudi Arabia) spilled blood together" in Kuwait and Iraq, the King continued, and Saudi Arabia valued this tremendously. Friendship can be a difficult issue that requires work, Abdullah said, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have done it for 70 years over three generations.  "Our disagreements don,t cut to the bone," he stated.  3.  (S) U.S. CREDIBILITY IS CRITICAL:  The Bush Administration is now in the past, the King said.  Both President Bushes were his friends, but the recent President Bush didn,t take his advice on dealing with issues in the region, and they found their problems "compounded."  The King said, "we are ready to consult, provide guidance and to do whatever is necessary.  We are people of the region and we know it well."  Brennan responded that President Obama wants to listen, and asked what advice the King would offer to President Obama.  Abdullah said his one piece of advice was that restoring U.S. credibility in the world was critically important. Brennan responded that this was an important issue for President Obama as well.  Brennan said that under President Obama we will restore our credibility.  He said the U.S. is a great country and we know what we have to do.  4.  (S) THE WORLD NEEDS OBAMA:  Brennan said President Obama looked forward to seeing the King at the G-20 summit in London.  "Thank God for bringing Obama to the presidency," the King answered, which has created "great hope" in the Muslim world.  "May God grant him strength and patience, Abdullah continued, "May God protect him.  I'm concerned about his personal safety.  America and the world need such a president."  5.  (C) THAT WITHOUT WHICH NO SAUDI MEETING IS COMPLETE: Abdullah said "as a friend" that "it was a mistake" to limit access of Saudi citizens to the U.S., since "this damages bilateral relations and the image of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia."  The King noted there were 60,000 Saudi students abroad, about one third of whom were in the U.S., and "others would have gone" but for the difficulties in gaining access to the U.S. The King noted that for many years very senior Saudi officials, including Prince Saud al-Faisal, had studied in the U.S.  He then noted that Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., Adel al Jubeir (who was interpreting for the King) had studied in the U.S. and was "half American" as a result.  He also said he was aware of, and appreciated, Ambassador Fraker's efforts to improve the visa situation "even though there were people in Washington who fought him."  Finally, he observed that anyone from Saudi Arabia who studies in the U.S. inevitably becomes a friend and advocate of the United States and that we only hurt ourselves by cutting off this flow of students.  DETAINEES  6.  (S) GUANTANAMO WILL BE CLOSED:  Brennan explained that President Obama had made a commitment to close Guantanamo to eliminate the potential propaganda benefits its existence provided to Al-Qaeda, but also because it was the right thing to do.  Brennan reassured the King, however, that President Obama would remain strong on counterterrorism.  Brennan presented the King with a letter from President Obama addressing the issue of Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo. Brennan noted that he had met with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN) the day before to discuss at length The issue of the Yemeni detainees.  Brennan further stated that he would be traveling to Sanaa the next day to meet with President Saleh, as the issue of the remaining 99 Yemeni detainees still needed to be resolved.  Brennan praised MbN as an outstanding counterterrorism partner, and that the MOI was doing a wonderful, courageous job in countering the terrorist threat to the Kingdom.  Returning to the subject later in the conversation, Brennan warned that the U.S. feared Yemen could become another Waziristan, and urged that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia needed to work together to keep Al-Qaeda in Yemen from growing even more dangerous.  The King replied that having Somalia next door to Yemen only adds to the danger.  Brennan said that the capabilities of the Ministry of the Interior security forces had grown impressively over the past 10 years.  Brennan added that counterterrorism and intelligence sharing cooperation between our countries had never been better and that MbN deserved the credit.  In an unusual concession, made at the conclusion of their conversation, the King said, "be assured I am fully briefed on the work you are doing with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef."  7.  (S) HOW TO TRACK DETAINEES:  "I've just thought of something," the King added, and proposed implanting detainees with an electronic chip containing information about them and allowing their movements to be tracked with Bluetooth.  This was done with horses and falcons, the King said.  Brennan replied, "horses don,t have good lawyers," and that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the U.S., but agreed that keeping track of detainees was an extremely important issue that he would review with appropriate officials when he returned to the United States.  IRAN  8.  (S) A "HEATED EXCHANGE":  The King noted that Iranian FM Mottaki had been "sitting in that same seat (as Brennan) a few moments ago."   The King described his conversation with FM Mottaki as "a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs."  When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that "these are Muslims."  "No, Arabs" countered the King, "You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters."  The King said the Iranians wanted to improve relations and that he responded by giving Mottaki an ultimatum.  "I will give you one year" (to improve ties), "after that, it will be the end."  9.  (S) "SPARE US YOUR EVIL":  The King expressed hope the U.S. would review its Iran policy and "come to the right conclusion."  Brennan responded that President Obama was personally reviewing U.S. Iran policy and wanted to hear the King's thoughts.  Abdullah asserted that Iran is trying to set up Hizballah-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians don't think they are doing anything wrong and don't recognize their mistakes.  "I said (to Mottaki) that's your problem," recounted the King. Abdullah said he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election, were he to run.  He described Iran not as "a neighbor one wants to see," but as "a neighbor one wants to avoid."   He said the Iranians "launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world."  A solution to the Arab/Israeli conflict would be a great achievement, the King said, but Iran would find other ways to cause trouble. "Iran's goal is to cause problems," he continued, "There is no doubt something unstable about them."  He described Iran as "adventurous in the negative sense," and declared "May God prevent us from falling victim to their evil."  Mottaki had tendered an invitation to visit Iran, but Abdullah said he replied "All I want is for you to spare us your evil."  Summarizing his history with Iran, Abdullah concluded: "We have had correct relations over the years, but the bottom line is that they cannot be trusted."  10.  (S) AN EMPTY CHANNEL:  The King said "three years ago" Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei had sent his adviser Ali Akbar Velayati with a letter asking for Abdullah's agreement to establish a formal back channel for communication between the two leaders.  Abdullah said he had agreed, and the channel was established with Velayati and Saudi FM Saud al-Faisal as the points of contact.  In the years since, the King noted, the channel had never been used.  11.  (S) A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD:  Brennan responded that the Saudis lived in a dangerous neighborhood with Iran across the Gulf, with Saudi Arabia sharing a long border with Yemen, and with a number of other troublesome countries nearby. Brennan noted that we have a lot of work to do in the Middle East together.  The King responded that the world,s attention was focused on the region.  He further stated that he believed that the U.S. could help in this sensitive region, but that we should not take matters lightly.  Brennan noted that President Obama is fully aware of the dangers in the region, that the U.S. knew that it had to remain involved in constructing a solution, and that we would seek the King,s counsel in dealing with the many issues in the Middle East.  The King asked if that included Iran.  Brennan responded that it did.  Brennan said that we had our eyes wide open to Iranian ambitions, that we were not nave to the dangers Iran posed to Saudi Arabia, and that Iran could not be allowed to succeed in its destabilizing activites. Brennan observed that the President had ordered a complete review of U.S. Iran policy and made reference to a passage in the President,s letter that we needed to test Iran,s intentions to cease its destabilizing behavior and live up to its international obligations.  Brennan further observed that the U.S.-Saudi partnership had to remain strong and that together, and with others, we needed to thwart Iran,s nuclear ambitions.  "That is important," responded the King. Finally, Brennan said the President wanted the King to know he had a good friend in the White House who would be willing to assist in any way that he could.  The King thanked Mr. Brennan, said he appreciated the sentiments, said that he had great respect for President Obama, and reflected that we had been great friends for many years and would remain friends as our disagreements were minor.  12.  (U) SEE REFTEL:  Ref A provided a separate readout on the Iran discussion and the King's meeting with Mottaki.  IRAQ  13.  (S) IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND IRAN:  Brennan expressed the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving peace and stability in Iraq.  The King replied that this was "in the hands of God," though he agreed that Iraq was vitally important to both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.  The King also pointed out that "some say the U.S. invasion handed Iraq to Iran on a silver platter; this after we fought Saddam Hussein."  14.  (S) NO HOPE FOR MALIKI:  The King said he had "no confidence whatsoever in (Iraqi PM) Maliki, and the Ambassador (Fraker) is well aware of my views."  The King affirmed that he had refused former President Bush's entreaties that he meet with Maliki.  The King said he had met Maliki early in Maliki's term of office, and the Iraqi had given him a written list of commitments for reconciliation in Iraq, but had failed to follow through on any of them.  For this reason, the King said, Maliki had no credibility.  "I don,t trust this man," the King stated, "He's an Iranian agent."  The King said he had told both Bush and former Vice president Cheney "how can I meet with someone I don,t trust?"  Maliki has "opened the door for Iranian influence in Iraq" since taking power, the King said, and he was "not hopeful at all" for Maliki, "or I would have met with him."  AN ALERT AND ENGAGING HOST  15.  (S) I MISS MY HORSES:  The King appeared alert and at times animated, entertaining his guests with anecdotes about his encounters with Iranian leaders (septel), and throwing up his hands in complaint when asked if he spent time with his horses: "I see them on television when they race," he said. "I love horses," he exclaimed, "every couple of weeks I get to see them, and then I have a very calm and restful sleep."  16.  (S) DIALOGUE AND REFORM AS DUTY:  In response to Brennan,s praise for the King,s interfaith dialogue initiative, his commitment to advancing rights as reflected by his recent appointment of the first female (deputy education) minister, the King said "Thanks for the sentiment but I did nothing special, only what I thought was my duty. I believe we do our duty as determined by God."  17.  (S) PARTICIPANTS:  Saudi Arabia -- Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud -- HRH Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, Assistant Minister of the Interior -- Ambassador to the U.S. Adel al-Jubeir (interpreter)  U.S. -- John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism -- Ambassador Ford Fraker -- Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues Clint Williamson -- John Duncan, NSC Director for Counterterrorism -- Shaun Coughlin, Special Assistant, S/WCI -- Embassy control officer/notetaker  18.

Wednesday, 22 April 2009, 11:00S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RPO DUBAI 000177 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL:  4/22/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ECON, ETRD, KDEM, IR SUBJECT: IRAN REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE--WINDOW ON IRAN--APRIL 22, 2009DUBAI 00000177 001.2 OF 003CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (S/NF) Game of Attrition. Ahmadinejads defeats on the budget and his plan to distribute cash payments to lower-income Iranians show that power centers, such as the Majles, are actively working to pressure the President prior to the June election, according to [Source removed]. These power centers are also stepping up their lobbying of Supreme Leader Khamenei to get his backing to stall or overturn some Presidential authorities. This game is increasingly being played out in the media, where the sides openly attack each other, and where the Presidents public defenses are weakening his hand and depleting political capital that he would prefer to save for the bigger fights ahead. The cash payment plan could have garnered AN additional votes, but he continues to work the rounds in the provinces and maintain his base of support where it really matters. By June, the current policy debates will matter less, and it is too early to consider these moves decisive to ANs electoral prospects, according to the economist. Comment: If these power centers can get increased backing from Khamenei, we may see some interesting fireworks in Iranian press in the coming weeks. As IRPO has previously reported, identifying the power centers responsible for AN setbacks on economic policy last month is difficult but could include a broad spectrum of political factions.2. (S/NF) [Name removed] said the MOIS will sometimes help assemble charges against defendants, direct cases to particular judges, and order judges to rule a particular way. Structurally, he said the Revolutionary Courts are similar to other courts, fall under the Judiciarys authority, and are theoretically supposed to follow the same law. Defendants are allowed to have lawyers during their trials, can defend themselves, and can appeal decisions. Asked about Roxanna Saberi, [Name removed] said he was aware of her case, but had no specific information on it. Comment: The Revolutionary Courts lack of transparency and seemingly baseless decision making make [Name removed] allegations plausible and perhaps probable. [Name removed] work in the judiciary branch as a public prosecutor [Location removed] also gives his assertions some credibility, but he did not work in the Revolutionary Courts. His accusations are more likely to reflect the legal communitys assumptions rather than first-hand knowledge of MOIS influence. [Name removed] was also notable for the depth of his anti-regime sentiment, which probably colors his impressions of the Revolutionary Courts.3. (S/NF) Mousavis Economic Program. Moderate presidential candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi announced his economic program to the Iranian press this week, emphasizing economic growth and job creation from a rejuvenated and expanded private sector. Mousavi criticized ANs halting steps at privatization, calling them the institutionalization of non-productive government management. Stability in government policies and a strict adherence to the planning documents of a restored Management and Planning Organization (MPO) and the rule of law, are other key planks. The best talking point in the plan, social justice doesnt mean equal distribution of poverty, challenges ANs key economic goal by inserting economic growth into the equation and highlighting his poor economic management. Mousavis plan only briefly mentions subsidy reforms, stressing the need to implement them gradually, after careful preparation. Comment: Mousavis plan mentions Article 44 of Irans constitution, which defines the role of the state, cooperative, and private sectors in Irans economy, but his emphasis on a strong private sector may open the plan to criticism that it is in conflict with the constitution. Mousavi also threatens to withdraw Irans Fifth Five Year Development Plan, currently being drafted, if AN submits it to the Majles before the election. An IRPO contact [Source removed], didnt expect the plan to be finished until later this year.4. (S/NF)[Name removed] said Irans Ministry of Commerce has approved the creation of an Iran-Americas Chamber of Commerce in anticipation of improved US-Iran ties. Although the chambers primary focus is the US, due to political sensitivities, it will not be called an Iran-US chamber. [Name removed] made the following points:-- Khamenei instructed Ahmadinejad to base the Fifth Five Year Development Plan on a draft from the Expediency Council. Hosseini alleged that both the Expediency Council and the president submitted drafts of the plan to Khamenei and Khamenei favored the Expediency Councils version.-- The current year will be positive for Iranian businesses. Hosseini, admittedly in contrast with many of his colleagues, is optimistic because the election allows Iran the opportunity to remove Ahmadinejad and because he believes economic ties with the US will be a positive shock to the Iranian economy.-- Khamenei moderated his support for Ahmadinejad following Khatamis decision to exit the contest. Hosseini predicts Mir Hossein Mousavi will win the election.-- The TCC meetings are more productive than the ICCIM meetings.  The TCC has a monthly meeting with government representatives, including ministers; the TCC members prepare for the meetings and, typically, complain a great deal during the meetings about government policy. Although the government is not always responsive to their complaints, following a recent meeting, the oil minister appointed a committee to resolve the TCCs concerns. Participants in ICCIM meetings, which include representatives from the provincial chambers, are typically unprepared.--Iranians seeking an export license must be a member of a chamber of commerce and both the Ministry of Commerce and a chamber must approve the export license.Comment: [Name removed] seems well placed to comment on economic and political developments in Iran. However, his assertion that the Expediency Council submitted a draft of the next Five Year Development plan is unusual because normally the presidents office drafts the plan and submits it to the Majles. The early involvement of the Expediency Council may reflect Rafsanjanis concern over Ahmadinejads economic policies. Khamenei in a letter to Ahmadinejad in January outlined the general policies to be included in the plan; it is possible the letter is based on a plan from the Expediency Council.5.

DUBAI 00000316  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (U) This is a joint cable by the Iran Regional Presence Office and the Dubai Regional Media Hub.    2. (S/NF) Summary: Since Iran's June 12 presidential elections, Arab media have intensely focused their coverage on the demonstrations in Iran and the international community's response to the government crackdown.  Whereas in recent years the Arab media have limited their commentary to Iran's external relations -- particularly its regional ambitions and the international implications of its nuclear program -- during the post-election crisis Arab commentators have, for the first time, poked a hole in the veneer of the Islamic Republic's internal political system and explored its underpinnings more closely, often challenging the system's very legitimacy in on-air commentary.  A number of these commentators have opined that Ahmadinejad has, at least in the near term, lost standing among some moderate Arabs, who have come to view Ahmadinejad's administration as oppressive, unpopular, and undemocratic, much as they criticize many Arab governments.  However, all of the Arab media figures we spoke to emphasized that Arab criticism of Ahmadinejad has not necessarily led to increased support for U.S. policy in the region.  On the contrary, closer analysis suggests that Ahmadinejad's eroding popularity in the Arab world has created a scenario in which any U.S. effort to engage the current Iranian government will be perceived by a wide spectrum of Arabs as accommodation with Ahmadinejad.    ALL EYES ON IRAN  ----------------    3. (S/NF) Iran's post-election crisis has dominated the Arab media's news coverage for the past seven weeks.  The demonstrations have garnered special coverage on Al-Arabiya and have consistently been among the top headlines on Al-Jazeera. The marketing director of the Middle East Broadcasting Company (MBC), parent company of Al-Arabiya, told IRPO/DRMH that Al-Arabiya's viewership has skyrocketed since the June 12 election.  Al-Arabiya's news website has also experienced a dramatic increase in visits from users living in the region between Tripoli and Amman, which the marketing director, a native of Lebanon, attributed to the tremendous interest Sunni Arabs have in watching the drama in Iran unfold.  Coverage of Iran's election aftermath is not limited to straightforward news reporting; editorial pages, media commentaries, and the Arab blogosphere have also been abuzz with debate over the demonstrations, the international community's response, and the implications of these events for the Arab world.  While Iran's elections may no longer command daily headlines in the Western media, nearly all the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke recognized that the Arab street remains firmly focused on the recent unrest and continuing political drama playing out in Iran.    THE BENEVOLENT DICTATOR'S FALL FROM GRACE?  ------------------------------------------    4. (S/NF) A Syrian journalist and blogger, who owns a media consultancy firm in Dubai, believes that many in the Arab street initially viewed Ahmadinejad when he came to power in 2005 as a "benevolent dictator."  Citing the tradition of the Mahdi, the media consultant argued that both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs are taught from early childhood to await the arrival of a strong and unimpeachable figure who will lead the Muslim world.  The media consultant maintained that even secular Arabs view the world, albeit unintentionally, with this ingrained mindset.  Our contact argued that Ahmadinejad played in to this narrative, and when Ahmadinejad arrived on the international stage many Arabs saw him, in contrast to their own flawed leaders, as a humble and pious man who was brave enough to stand up for his people and the greater Muslim world by confronting Israel and the West head on.  However,  both the intensely competitive campaign period and the forceful reaction by the Iranian people to the official election results have led some moderate Arabs to rethink Ahmadinejad's  true disposition. The election, the media consultant said, led some Arabs to understand that despite his astutely crafted and well-marketed image in the Arab world,  DUBAI 00000316  002.2 OF 003   Ahmadinejad is resented by many Iranians for domestic mismanagement, incompetence, and corruption.  Because of this public fall from grace, so the media consultant told us, Ahmadinejad is no longer the "untouchable, holy figure" in the Arab world he once was -- his flaws have brought him down to the level of the Arab world's own imperfect leaders. An Al-Arabiya executive, speaking at a recent conference, said that the election aftermath had destroyed the image many Arabs had of the Islamic Revolution, and Ahmadinejad's legitimacy as a leader was now open to question. [NOTE: The media consultant attributed Iran's perceived "victories" over the U.S. and the West to Ahmadinejad, as opposed to Supreme Leader Khamenei.  While conventional wisdom in the West is that Khamenei has the final say over Iran's most vital interests, including the nuclear program, the consultant's comments suggest that the Arab street views Ahmadinejad as much more influential in the Islamic Republic's decision-making system.]    POST-ELECTION CRISIS NOT A SILVER BULLET FOR ARAB REGIMES  --------------------------------------------- ------------    5. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad's fall from grace notwithstanding, most of the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke agreed that Arab governments have a limited ability to capitalize on Ahmadinejad's missteps because of the skeletons in their own closets.   Al-Arabiya's former Tehran bureau chief observed that Arab regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who no doubt would like to exploit Ahmadinejad's current vulnerabilities, have remained noticeably silent.  In his view, they realize that any statement condemning Tehran's crackdown on peaceful dissidents would appear untenably hypocritical in the eyes of their own citizens.  He considers this public silence yet another "missed opportunity" for Arab leaders to take a stand to counter Ahmadinejad's rhetoric and further detract from his popularity with the Arab street.    NEW SPACE TO DISAGREE WITH AHMADINEJAD AND THE U.S.  --------------------------------------------- ------    6. (S/NF)  All of the Arab commentators and news media figures we spoke to agreed that the U.S. "played it right" throughout the post-election crisis by staying away from detailed public comments that could be perceived as interventionist.  However, the Arab commentators were quick to distinguish between criticism of Ahmadinejad in the Arab street and support for U.S. policies.  The Syrian media consultant said that the heated debates before the election, in which the three challengers -- Mousavi, Karroubi, and Reza'i -- publicly criticized Ahmadinejad for corruption and economic mismanagement, made it clear to Arabs that this election was about Iran, not the U.S.  This distinction, coupled with the U.S.' restraint in commenting on the election, provided an unprecedented window for Arab commentators to criticize Ahmadinejad without appearing to side with the U.S.    7. (S/NF) Examples of this played out during two separate appearances by the Dubai Regional Media Hub Acting Director on live panel discussions on Abu Dhabi TV and Lebanese New TV regarding regional issues, including events in Iran.  Whereas fellow Arab panelist resolutely disagreed with her comments in support of U.S. policy in the region, in particular the peace process, they felt free to openly criticize Ahmadinejad's government, which they refrained from doing in the past, for its internal crackdown and regional ambitions.  One Saudi commentator contrasted Turkish regional mediation, which he described as a positive force in the region, with Iranian regional intervention, which he called pernicious and destabilizing.  A Lebanese commentator noted the irony of Iran accusing outsiders of interfering in its internal affairs when there is not "one corner of the Arab world" where Iran does not intervene behind the scenes.    AHMADINEJAD DOWN BUT NOT OUT  DUBAI 00000316  003.2 OF 003    ----------------------------    8. (S/NF) As Al-Arabiya's Tehran bureau chief noted, while Ahmadinejad's image may have taken a hit in the Arab street as a result of the government's handling of domestic dissent, the damage is not necessarily permanent.  In his view, the Arab street is notoriously emotional and "could easily be turned to support Ahmadinejad once again" with some trumped up slogans and public bravado.  The bureau chief believed that, in the perceived leadership void left by Arab leaders on regional issues, Ahmadinejad could rally public opinion by capitalizing on any number of sensitive issues for the Arab street, most prominent among them Israel, at upcoming international fora. The Syrian media consultant, too, cautioned the U.S. not to overestimate any erosion in Ahmadinejad's popularity with Arabs.  In his opinion, Ahmadinejad has only lost standing with a segment of moderates in the Arab street; he believes that most Arabs are so polarized, either for or against Ahmadinejad, that the allegations of voter fraud and the violent post-election crackdown on protesters will not permanently sway their positions one way or the other.    ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN: NO PLEASING THE ARAB STREET  --------------------------------------------- ----    9. (S/NF) Comment:  Once the dust settles on Iran's post-election crisis, Arabs will look to see if the U.S. deals with Ahmadinejad as it pursues its nuclear nonproliferation agenda despite the lingering questions over the legitimacy of his election.  If the U.S. enters negotiations with Ahmadinejad's government, moderate Arab observers may argue that the U.S., for the sake of its own national interest, has cut a deal at the expense of pro-democracy advocates -- just as many in the Arab street believe the U.S. has done with a number of Arab regimes.  Those Arabs who continue to support Ahmadinejad, on the other hand, may perceive negotiations as a personal victory for a humble leader who brought the U.S. to its knees through steadfast resistance.  Thus, Ahmadinejad's "fall from grace" in the Arab world may have created yet another obstacle to improved Arab perceptions of the U.S. -- in which engagement with an Ahmadinejad-led government is now a potentially lose-lose scenario in which Arabs at both ends of the pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad spectrum will consider negotiations with Teheran an accommodation with the Iranian president.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 11 Supreme Leader Khamenei gave the main Tehran Friday Prayer sermon.  In his comments Khamenei sought to characterize his treatment of opposition in line with the practices of both the first Shia Imam Ali and also with that of his predecessor Ayatollah Khomeini.   He said while criticism within the framework of the existing political system was acceptable, those fundamentally opposing the system and seeking to harm the nation's security will be dealt with decisively.  In keeping with previous warnings about the "soft overthrow" of the existing order, he cautioned against dissolution from within, saying that the only way to prevent this was to remain true to religion, revolutionary principles, and to Khomeini's teachings.   The recent Presidential election with its massive turnout proved to the world that "regardless of whom the people voted for" they still believed in the system.  Referring to Iran's position on the international stage, Khamenei said Iran took pride in standing against the oppressive nature of its enemies and that Iran wouldn't be cowed into relinquishing its rights, "nuclear or non-nuclear."  He called for a large turnout on the September 18 Qods Day march in support of the Palestinian people, although warning that this event should not be used to "sow dissension," an implied reference to the fact that "Green Path" oppositionists are reportedly seeking a massive turn-out on this day as a show of strength.    2. (C) SUMMMARY (CONT): Although Supreme Leader Khamenei 's tone was consistently mild, Iranian press and IRPO contacts have interpreted this speech as a clear warning to the "Green Path" oppositionist leaders to cease and desist, an interpretation reinforced by the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated, and the forwarding of this case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution (reftel). END SUMMARY.    3. (U) On September 11, Supreme Leader Khamenei gave both Tehran Friday Prayer Sermons (normally there are two, the first covering ostensibly religious topics, the second focusing more on issues of the day).  As the date fell on the anniversary of the martyrdom of Imam Ali, the first Shia Imam, the topic of his first sermon was the government of Imam Ali.  Although putatively non-political in nature, Khamenei used this sermon to set the stage for themes to which he would refer back in his second, political, sermon.  He pointed out the moral nature of Imam Ali's government, adding that "when religion is separated from politics, politics becomes immoral and secular."  In an implicit comparison with current times, he also stressed that Imam Ali consistently preferred to be lenient in dealing with those who opposed him, until and unless there was a threat to the system, at which point he would act decisively.    TYPES OF CONFLICT    4. (U) In the start of his second, political speech, Supreme Leader Khamenei said he wished to address his remarks to those in Iran's political sphere.  Dissension had been a feature of the Islamic Republic since its founding.  These conflicts have had different causes, to include theoretical differences of opinion, conflicts of interest and clashing personalities. Referring implicitly to his comments on the management style of Imam Ali, Khamenei said that Khomeini's normal method for dealing with dissension and conflict was to use moderation and leniency.  In an implicit reference to Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, each of whom has referred back to his own revolutionary credentials, Khamenei said that at times Khomeini had to deal with conflicts even with those who had solid revolutionary backgrounds, at the level of the Prime Minister (i.e. Mousavi himself), President (Khamenei himself) and even at levels above the President (a reference to Khomeini's dismissal of Supreme Leader-designate Ayatollah Montazeri).    5. (U) Khamenei said the system didn't seek to stifle those who "think differently" (note: 'digar andishan," a term used to refer to the intellectual current associated, inter alia, with the Khatami-ist 'Second of Khordad' movement).  It was good for Iran's officials to have critics point out weaknesses if those  DUBAI 00000379  002.2 OF 003   doing so act within and accept the basic principles of the system, and the government will not move against such criticism.    6. (U) However, again drawing the link to Imam Ali, Khamenei said that during Khomeini's time if there were danger of infiltration of "harmful principles" into the system, and if this conflict were in some way a threat to core principles, Khomeini would then "act decisively." The regime, much like any human being, had to defend itself against such an attack. Linking his actions to those of Imam Ali and Khomeini, Khamenei said that today also the regime will act if it senses that someone is acting against its principles and security.    AVOIDING CORRUPTION FROM WITHIN    7. (U) In keeping with recent dominant public warnings about "soft overthrow" and "soft wars," Khamenei turned to the theme of corruption from within, both at an individual and societal level.  At an individual level, deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption were to be avoided at all costs, as small slips and mistakes could lead to larger ones in a slow and gradual process.  The cure for such threats is self-awareness, piety and the ongoing moral policing of friends and family.  If such impiety is happening to a government official the problem is worse, as it affects society.    8. (U) At a societal and governmental level, deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption can happen in much the same manner.  The decay comes from within, and although on the outside the society can still appear like an  "Islamic Republic," on the inside it could suffer degradation and decay.  In this regard, societal dynamics can either be positive or negative.  Positive dynamics means moving ever closer towards justice and religion, which improves social, political and economic conditions and also improves society's abilities to stand up to one's enemies.  But a society with negative dynamics will have growing class and social differences and worsening political and economic conditions.  Instead of using freedom for growth, such a decaying society will abuse freedom to pursue corruption, sin and dissension.  Such negative dynamics also cause the society to "feel weak and retreat" in the face of one's enemy, unilateral disarmament and relinquishing one's rights, nuclear and non-nuclear, which is another sign of societal decline.    ELECTION    9. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said the June 12 Presidential election with its massive turnout was a glorious triumph for the Islamic Revolution.  The turnout demonstrated to the world that the Iranian people believed in their system of government now more than ever, "regardless of who voted for whom.  After the election, the enemy sought to create disturbances in order to diminish Iran's achievement and weaken the peoples' confidence in the system, but to no effect.  There will be similarly large turnout in future elections, Khamenei predicted, showing the ongoing support of the people.    IRAN'S ENEMIES    10. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said all governments have enemies, but what is important to note is the nature of one's friends and enemies.  Iran's friends are Muslim nations and peoples throughout the world, and the oppressed of the world. Its enemies are the thieves and oppressors of the world, and Iran should not be scared to be the enemies of the U.S. and the U.K.  It was important for Iran to show strength in the face of such enemies.     DUBAI 00000379  003.2 OF 003   QODS DAY    11. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said that many on the global stage have tried to bury the issue of Palestine, but Iran has prevented that, a fact which has upset "the U.S. and the Zionists."  He called for a massive turnout of support on the September 18 Qods Day Rally in Tehran, and cautioned all that no one should use this event to sow dissension, an implicit reference to "Green Path" opposition plans to use this authorized march as a show of its own strength.    12. (C) COMMENT: Although his tone was mild, Iran oppositionist press in addition to IRPO interlocutors with ties to the "Green Path" opposition have said that, in the words of one source, "Khameni's speech was being viewed ominously in Iran," especially when viewed in conjunction with the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated, and forwarding the case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution (reftel).  According to one executive branch official, Khamenei's speech has made "the specter of the arrest of Karrubi - and possibly even Mousavi at a later stage" all the more probable.    13. (C) COMMENT (CONT): Contrary to Khamenei's assertions and as evidenced by recent comments by IRGC Commander Jaafari, the regime's interpretation of legitimate dissent has constricted dramatically, with Jaffari equating "soft overthrow" with those seeking to change Iran's behavior in any way.   Certainly, Khamenei seems to be trying to regain the high ground he forfeited by descending so openly into the political fray, as shown by his attempts to draw comparisons among himself, Khomeini, and Imam Ali.  Separately, the Supreme Leader's formulation of "relinquishing ones rights, nuclear or non-nuclear" as a sign of societal dissolution and immorality indicates that Iran will continue to adhere to its hard public line in advance of any future negotiations.  Finally, it is also worth noting that Supreme Leader Khamenei made no endorsement, either explicit or implicit, of President Ahmadinejad, saying only that the recent Presidential election was good due to the turnout, "regardless of who voted for whom."

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RPO DUBAI 000389  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL:  9/24/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV IRSUBJECT: IRAN: CLERICAL CONFAB STIFFS RAFSANJANI FOR SUPREME LEADER  REF: RPO DUBAI 384  DUBAI 00000389  001.2 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyer, Director, Iran Regional Presence Office, DOS. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: Oppositionist hopes that Iran's clerical class would mobilize to oppose Supreme Leader Khamenei's post-election policies appear sharply diminished in the wake of the first Assembly of Experts meeting since the June 12 Presidential election. Not only did the Assembly, which has the power to appoint, supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, give a ringing endorsement of Khamenei's rule and his handling of the post-election crisis, it did so in the conspicuous absence of its Chair, Ayatollah Rafsanjani.  Moreover, leaks of the closed-door proceedings to the conservative press indicate that at least two prominent members of this clerical deliberative body excoriated Rafsanjani for his failure to support Khamenei during the unrest.  Despite his absence at the closure of the Assembly of Experts meeting, Rafsanjani was compelled to publicly endorse the closing statement while seated at the knee of the Supreme Leader during a September 24 press conference. END SUMMARY.    Assembly of Experts: A 'Deliberative' Body    2 (C) The Majles-e Khobregan, or Assembly of Experts (AOE), is a Constitutionally-mandated deliberative body composed of 86 directly-elected senior clerics from across the country.  By law, the Assembly must meet for a minimum of two days twice a year.  Though theoretically vested with the power to appoint, supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, in practical terms the Assembly's only real responsibility is to appoint the Supreme Leader's successor should he die or become incapacitated.  As such, the AOE's last noteworthy act was appointing current Supreme Leader Khamenei after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 death.  Every subsequent meeting has ended with the issuance of a perfunctory statement lauding the Assembly's decision to appoint Khamenei and praising his leadership. Nevertheless, according to Article 111 of the Constitution, the Assembly can find Khamenei unfit for office; accordingly, control of the AOE remains a (potential) check on the Supreme Leader's otherwise unbridled power.    3. (C) The Assembly is currently chaired by Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was re-elected to the two-year term of Speaker in March 2009.  At the time of his re-election, he garnered 51 votes, an improvement over the 46 votes he received in 2007, despite efforts by hardline conservative clerics, led by Ayatollahs Mesbah-Yazdi and Ibrahim Yazdi, to unseat him.    First Meeting since the Election    4. (C) On September 22-23 the AOE convened for the first time since Iran's disputed June 12 election.  Rafsanjani opened the sixth official meeting of this Fourth Assembly of Experts by again cautioning that a "suspicious faction" is trying to create rifts among Iran's leaders and by condemning the "atmosphere of insults and dispute" that has prevailed since the June presidential election.  He also promised that "system insiders of good will" are developing a plan to resolve Iran's domestic political problems. His opening statement was followed by reports to the body by Judiciary deputy Mohsen Ejei (Intelligence Minister during the presidential election and its aftermath) and Revolutionary Guards Commander Jaafari. According to press reports, at least sixteen Assembly members spoke.    5. (C) Though summaries of the closed-door proceedings released by Rafsanjani's office did not reflect any discord among the members and indeed indicated the body's support of him, conservative Iranian press charged Rafsanjani's office with 'censoring' coverage of the proceeding, reporting that at least two prominent members sharply criticized Rafsanjani for failing to support the Supreme Leader after the disputed election.  One quotation prominently featured in conservative news outlets was Mashhad Friday Prayer Leader Ayatollah al-Hoda rhetorically asking Rafsanjani, "why after twenty years, have you remained silent in the face of these unprecedented insults (to the Supreme Leader)?"  DUBAI 00000389  002.2 OF 002      6. (C) More tellingly, Rafsanjani did not attend the second and final day of the meeting, with recently retired former Judiciary Head Ayatollah Shahrudi chairing in his absence. Hardline conservative Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami (the same cleric who replaced Rafsanjani as Qods Day prayer leader - reftel) read the Assembly's final statement, which was an unqualified if not fawning endorsement of the Supreme Leader himself and his "wise policies" for quickly extinguishing the post-election "flames of sedition."  Khatami noted that Rafsanjani, despite his absence, agreed with "every point" of the final statement, which also credited Khamenei for dismissing the fraud allegations as part of a plot to undermine the Islamic Republic.  The final statement was also noteworthy in its perfunctory congratulations to President Ahmadinejad for his election victory, and its more sincere admonishment of Ahmadinejad to scrupulously follow Supreme Leader Khamenei's guidance.    7. (C) COMMENT: Following the disputed June 12 presidential election, many speculated that the axis of a Rafsanjani counter-attack would focus on rallying clerical support to his cause. However, the rumored AOE "emergency session" never convened, and absent such a meeting it remained unclear how much support Rafsanjani had among this body that reflects the political leanings of Iran's traditional senior clergy.  Now that the AOE has met, it is clear that the clerical cavalry isn't coming over the horizon anytime soon.  Furthermore, the AOE final statement, seen in conjunction with the removal of Rafsanjani as Qods Day Speaker (reftel), indicates in the clearest terms yet that in the most severe crisis of his career, Rafsanjani is unable to mobilize his once vast and influential patronage network to achieve his political ends.  And given that Rafsanjani's presumed power is serving as at least a partial deterrent to further regime moves against Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami, the results of this two-day AOE session bode ill for the leadership of the oppositionist "Green Path of Hope."  END COMMENT. EYRE
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 STATE 100153  SENSITIVE  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: IR KNNP MNUC PARMSUBJECT: EXISTENCE OF A COVERT URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY IN IRAN  1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3 for action.  2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND:  The United States is aware that Iran has been secretly building another enrichment facility, in addition to the one at Natanz.  Some other governments are also in possession of similar information.  The United States, France, and the United Kingdom briefed the IAEA on Thursday, 24 September on this facility.  The United States remains committed to a diplomatic resolution of international concerns with Iran's nuclear program.  These concerns are reinforced by the existence of this facility.  Immediate, unconditional cooperation by Iran with the IAEA is essential to address these concerns and to ensure that a diplomatic process has a chance to succeed.  3.  (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Posts are requested to inform senior host government officials of the existence of a covert uranium enrichment facility in Iran using the points contained in paragraph 4.  Posts are NOT authorized to provide a copy of the points.  Washington understands that, in a previous iteration of this message, a non-paper was authorized.  If points have already been conveyed in writing, posts are instructed to request discretion on the part of host government interlocutors.  If asked about coincidental claims by an Iranian exile group of previously unknown nuclear weaponization sites, posts should convey the following, IC-cleared point:  -- We do not believe that these other sites that you refer to are the Qom enrichment site.  There are many suspect sites, including these others, that we monitor.  4.  (U) BEGIN TALKING POINTS:  -- We have acquired substantial, specific information that Iran has been secretly building another enrichment facility ? in addition to Natanz.  -- The facility is located near the city of Qom, Iran, and has been under construction for several years.  The facility is located in an underground tunnel complex on the grounds of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Base.  -- Earlier this year, we developed information that gave us increased confidence that the facility was a uranium enrichment site.  -- The site is under the management of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, but unknown to all but the most senior AEOI officials.  -- The site is intended to hold approximately 3000 centrifuges but we do not know what type of centrifuge Iran intends to employ there.  We assess an enrichment plant containing 3000 centrifuges is not adequate to produce regular fuel reloads for civilian nuclear power plants, which require a much larger number of centrifuges.  -- Based on our understanding of the status of the facility, we assess that Iran will not be able to begin enriching uranium there before at least 2010.  Iran is continuing construction of support buildings at the facility.  Intelligence indicates that earlier this year, Iran was installing the infrastructure required for centrifuges.  -- Iran may claim that this facility is for civilian nuclear fuel production.  The Iranian government continues to claim that it is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.  Yet this facility is too small to be viable for production of fuel for a nuclear power reactor.  It may be well-suited, however, for a military purpose.  -- We are aware that some other governments are in possession of similar information.  -- We learned this week that Iran has sent the IAEA a letter indicating that it is constructing a pilot fuel enrichment facility and that the "required infrastructure has been established."  -- The letter provides no details and states that  STATE 00100153  002 OF 002   "further complementary information will be provided in an appropriate and due time." We assume this new enrichment facility is the facility that we and other governments have been tracking.  -- We, the UK and France have briefed the IAEA on the information that they have so that they can fully investigate the facility.  The President, with his UK and French counterparts, plans to make an announcement Friday morning in Pittsburgh.  -- We firmly believe that the existence of a new centrifuge facility in Iran constitutes a serious violation of Iran's international obligations.  -- Iran was required to suspend all uranium enrichment- related activities in UN Security Council resolution 1737.  This legally-binding requirement has been reaffirmed in three subsequent UNSC resolutions.  -- When Iran decided to build this facility, it was obligated to declare this to the IAEA.  It failed to do so.  -- What is clear is that Iran once again has engaged in a deceit of the international community.   The President made clear that we are serious about using diplomacy to find a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear program, but in order to do so, Iran needs to be transparent and truthful.  -- It is now time for Iran to prove to the international community that it is willing to play by the rules.   We urge your public support on this matter as we head into the October 1 meeting with Iran.  -- It will particularly important that Iran understand that it must end the pattern of deception and once and for all commit itself to full transparency.   It is time for Iran to come clean on the questions about its weaponization studies and to implement the Additional Protocol.  -- The Ministers of the P5+1 held a productive meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly.  They stated their expectation that Iran will be prepared to take constructive steps when it meets with the P5+1 on October 1st.  In light of this new and troubling information, the burden is clearly on Iran to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.

SUMMARY AND TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.  (S/NF) This telegram replaces Ref A as the Department's comprehensive guidance on handling foreign national walk-ins, defectors, and asylum seekers - all of whom are generally referred to in this telegram as "walk-ins."  This telegram was coordinated with interagency partners, including CIA, DHS, DIA, and the FBI.  It explains the procedures for receiving walk-ins; determining whether they are of intelligence value and whether defector, temporary refuge, protection, resettlement, parole, or other status is appropriate; and coordinating an appropriate response.  A link to this telegram will be included in the Chief of Mission (COM) Guide on ClassNet (http://diplomaps.state.sgov.gov/com).  (For guidance on handling U.S. citizens requesting emergency protection ("temporary refuge") at posts, see Ref B.)  2.  (S/NF) COMs should ensure that all post personnel are properly prepared to handle walk-ins. Post management, RSO, and GRPO have the most responsibility for ensuring proper handling of walk-ins, but other officers may play critical roles.  3.  (S/NF) Correct handling of walk-ins is important for three principal reasons.  Walk-ins (1) may be sources of invaluable intelligence; (2) pose numerous security challenges; and (3) may need protection.  Improper handling of walk-ins can put them and post personnel at risk and result in the loss of important intelligence.  Thus, post's procedures must be clear, well-understood, and workable at any hour, day or night.  4.  (U) Questions or comments regarding the guidance in this telegram should normally be directed by telegram to INR/CCS, which will coordinate a Department response.  If additional guidance is required in an emergency walk-in situation, however, post should contact the Department's Operations Center (202-647-1512), which will alert the appropriate Department personnel.  5.  (U) This telegram contains the following sections:  A. - Storage and dissemination of this telegram (paragraph 6) B. - Post preparation for handling walk-ins (paragraphs 7-23) C. - Procedures for handling walk-in arrivals (paragraphs 24-33) D. - Requirements for reporting on walk-ins (paragraphs 34-39) E. - Temporary refuge guidance and cautions (paragraphs 40-52) F. - Long-term options for walk-ins(paragraphs 53- 63) G. - Travel assistance for walk-ins(paragraphs 64- 65)  END SUMMARY.   Section A.  STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION OF THIS TELEGRAM  6.  (U) Posts should retain this telegram in the RSO's files and in a location accessible to duty officers, replacing and destroying Ref A and any other prior versions.  RSOs should ensure that all officers have read this telegram and know where it is retained.  Section B.  POST PREPARATION FOR HANDLING WALK-INS  7.  (S/NF) Each post's Counterintelligence Working Group (CIWG) should meet upon receipt of this telegram to review post's procedures for dealing with walk-ins.  The CIWG should ensure that post's procedures are consistent with the guidance in this telegram and local security concerns, include appropriate defensive security measures, and allow screened walk-ins to meet securely with appropriate post officials.  8.  (S/NF) Post's walk-ins procedures should include (1) special procedures for the reception of embassy (including consular section) walk-ins of possible intelligence value; (2) procedures for constituent posts, if any; and (3) procedures for approaches at residences, in vehicles, on the street, via telephone, and through both electronic and hand-delivered mail.  Heightened security at USG installations increases the possibility of approaches to USG officials outside USG facilities. Because of the inherent risks, however, post procedures should permit arranging substantive meetings outside post only in exceptional circumstances and only after approval of the COM based on the recommendations of the RSO and GRPO.  9.  (S/NF) Post's procedures must allow for appropriately balancing the following considerations which may come into play in walk-in cases:  (a) post security; (b) the safety of the individual; (c) the intelligence value and bona fides of the individual; (d) whether the individual requires protection and, if so, whether appropriate protection is available from international organizations or host-country sources; (e) whether the individual should be resettled outside the host-country and, if so, whether resettlement in another country or the United States is possible; (f) the time available for resolution of the case; and (g) the need to safeguard the confidentiality of any information that may have a bearing on a future consular-related activity or possible resettlement request.  10.  (S/NF) Post's procedures must be cleared by the RSO and coordinated with the GRPO and, at posts with an FBI Legal Attache (LEGATT), with the LEGATT.  (All three should be on post's CIWG.) Post's RSO should update post's walk-in plan with the GRPO and LEGATT, if any, on a semi-annual basis or as needed.  11.  (S/NF) RSOs should ensure that all relevant potential participants in handling walk-ins are appropriately briefed and trained.  Non-cleared personnel can be told that a USG official will interview walk-ins, because that fact is not classified.  The fact that a walk-in may be referred to other post officials for a decision on further actions is classified and may not be shared with non-cleared personnel.  All briefings should emphasize the importance of ensuring that the walk- in is fully screened, but should also convey that legitimate walk-ins may exhibit nervous or anxious behavior, particularly because access controls and host nation security forces around many of our diplomatic posts make it difficult for walk-ins to approach our facilities discreetly.  All briefings should also stress the importance of not drawing attention to the walk-in or alerting host nation security personnel.  12.  (S/NF) RSO briefings should include (1) briefing those who may have first contact with a walk-in - including non-USG local guards and receptionists - on the procedures to follow at first contact; (2) providing additional briefings to MSGs, other USG security personnel, and USG duty officers on a semi-annual basis or as needed on more sensitive aspects of the program; (3) briefing consular officers on handling walk-ins who approach through a consular service window; and (4) briefing all arriving cleared USG personnel on the procedures for approaches that occur off post premises (as part of the arrival briefing).  13.  (S/NF) To ensure that walk-ins can communicate their wishes clearly, post may wish to prepare language cards that can be shown at first contact to a walk-in who does not speak English, giving options from which the walk-in can select.  One option should be "I wish to speak with an American official."  Other options should be plausible alternatives, such as "I wish to obtain information about travel requirements."  In addition to the local language, post should consider having such cards available in priority interest languages such as Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Farsi, Mandarin, and Korean, as appropriate in light of the local environment.  14.  (S/NF) The RSO should incorporate post's procedures into the MSG and local guard orders as necessary.  15.  (S/NF) Posts should designate a room, preferably outside the Public Access Control (PAC) hard-line, for conducting the initial interview of a walk-in.  16.  (S/NF) Post should have an interview guide that can be used during the initial interview, and should maintain a current roster of cleared USG personnel who can provide interpretation services to assist the RSO and others in interviewing walk- ins as required.  17.  (S/NF) Post procedures should clearly identify the officer who will do the initial interview of a walk-in, and a backup for when that officer is absent.  (These are normally the RSO and Assistant RSO.)  These officials should have a prearranged signal and appropriate contact numbers for notifying GRPO of a walk-in of possible intelligence value.  18.  (S/NF) MSGs, local guards, and receptionists should have a codeword or pre-arranged signal to alert the RSO (or other designated officer) of a person requesting to speak with a U.S. officer.  19.  (U) Post should verify that current phone numbers, addresses, and directions for host government offices that handle refugee claims and the local offices of the UNHCR and UNDP are included in post's walk-in procedures and the duty officer handbook.  This information should also be readily available as a handout for walk-ins.  20.  (U) Post procedures should contain current information on the host government's legal obligations towards persons claiming to be refugees or to be in danger of being tortured.  These obligations may arise from the host country's domestic law and/or treaty obligations.  States party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol, and the 1969 African Union Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa have agreed not to expel or return refugees, as defined in those instruments, from their territory under certain circumstances.  States party to the 1987 Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment have agreed not to expel or return an individual from their territory to another country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he/she would be in danger of being subjected to torture.  21.  (S/NF) RSO and GRPO should coordinate any operational tests of walk-in procedures.  22.  (S/NF) RSOs should review walk-in procedures with constituent posts and ensure that they are properly prepared to handle walk-ins.  This should include ensuring that constituent post's procedures are also incorporated into local guard orders as necessary.  23.  (S/NF) Posts without an RSO, GRPO, or UNHCR/UNDP presence in-country should promptly develop additional post-specific guidance to ensure that the guidance in this telegram is adjusted to fit their situation.  Section C.  PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING WALK-IN ARRIVALS  24.  (S/NF) The MSG, local guard, receptionist, or other employee or official who first makes contact with the walk-in should ascertain whether the walk- in wishes to talk with the USG official, using the language cards as necessary.  If so, they should use the pre-arranged signal to inform the USG official designated to deal with walk-ins (normally the RSO or Assistant RSO) as soon as possible. Posts with MSGs may wish to instruct non-USG local guards, receptionists, and others likely to be a walk-in's first point of contact to refer a walk-in who wishes to speak with a USG official to the MSG, and then have the MSG involve the RSO.  25.  (C) Post's first priority must be to determine whether the individual is carrying a weapon, device, or hazardous material that endangers post personnel.  Walk-ins must be screened and searched before being permitted within the security perimeter.  If a walk-in possesses any object or item that appears suspicious or potentially hazardous, security personnel should deny access even if the walk-in presents the item as evidence of some intelligence he offers, e.g., red mercury presented as proof of plutonium enrichment. Security personnel are not required to prove that an object, item, or material is hazardous to refuse entry to the walk-in.  Only DS-supplied and/or DS- approved instruments should be used to examine suspect material.  Posts should follow established DS and Department procedures for screening and reporting suspect materials, e.g., white powder incidents.  In the event post encounters material or information relating to alleged radioactive materials, please refer to Ref C for comprehensive interagency approved guidance.  26.  (C) The walk-in's identification and/or travel documents should be copied as soon as the walk-in is screened in, if at all possible.  Otherwise, the papers should be copied before the end of the walk- in's initial interview.  Identifying and keeping records of walk-ins is important for security and intelligence reasons; copying their identity documents early is advisable because walk-ins may get cold feet and leave if kept waiting for an interview.  27.  (S/NF) After the walk-in has been searched, the RSO or designated alternate must interview the walk-in, using post's interview guide.  The RSO should attempt to establish the individual's bona fides.  (Walk-ins may in fact be mentally disturbed persons, intelligence vendors, fabricators, provocateurs from hostile intelligence services, or persons gathering information on behalf of terrorist organizations.)  Once the subject's bona fides are established to the RSO's satisfaction, the RSO should establish what the walk-in wants, whether the walk-in appears to be of possible intelligence or counterintelligence interest, how much time the walk-in has, and methods for future contact, among other information.  The RSO must also attempt to determine whether the individual is in imminent danger, including (1) immediate physical danger, (2) danger of involuntary repatriation to a country where the individual's life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or (3) danger of involuntary repatriation to a country where it is more likely than not that the individual will be subjected to torture.  Finally, the RSO may have reason to interview the individual for information regarding potential threats to USG personnel and facilities.  (If such information is obtained, the RSO generally should advise the LEGATT and should consider flagging the individual for the Rewards for Justice Program.)  28.  (S/NF) Monitoring of foreign nationals in walk-in rooms overseas is permitted only in accordance with guidelines set forth in Ref D.  All other recording or monitoring conducted by post employees, including those in cover positions, must be consistent with the Department Notice of January 24, 1977 ("the Vance Memorandum"), which states that "No officer or employee of the State Department . . . shall direct, arrange for, permit, or undertake the monitoring or mechanical or electronic recording of any conversation, including any telephone conversation, without the express consent of all persons involved in the conversation," unless advance approval is granted by the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of State. (Reproduced at Tab U, Special Agent's Legal Authorities, available at http://intranet.state.gov.)  29.  (C) Post personnel should never leave a walk- in unattended. If possible, two or more post officials should work together during the interview phase.  30.  (S/NF) If the RSO finds the walk-in credible and to be of possible foreign intelligence or counterintelligence interest, the RSO should follow post procedures to ensure transfer of the walk-in to the GRPO as quickly as possible with minimal exposure to other post personnel.  The GRPO will determine further actions (interview, contact again at a later date, etc.).  31.  (C) Post must strictly limit disclosure of the fact of any request for temporary refuge, departure from the host country, asylum in the United States, third-country visa assistance, issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States, and requests to resettle elsewhere.  Only USG personnel with a need-to-know should be made aware of such requests.  32.  (C) Post should provide no comment in response to press inquiries, unless otherwise instructed by the Department.  33.  (C) Post must consult with the Department prior to responding to congressional inquiries on specific walk-in cases.  Section D.  REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ON WALK-INS  34.  (S/NF) If a walk-in is of intelligence interest, the case will be handled by the Intelligence Community (IC) once that interest is established, and reporting on the case will occur in IC channels.  Post must notify the Department of all/all cases not handled within the IC and involving the following, using the reporting channels described in paragraphs 37-39 below except where otherwise indicated:  (a) A person who may have information on immediate threats to USG personnel or facilities.  See paragraph 35 below for reporting channel instructions. (b) A person who possesses information regarding plans and intentions of governments and/or organizations hostile to the United States. (c) A person who may have information on weapons proliferation, weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, or any significant new intelligence or military-related subjects. (d) A foreign diplomat, foreign consular officer, other foreign government official (including members of the national police and the military), or political party official, regardless of his/her country of nationality. (e) A person who appears threatened by involuntary repatriation to a country where the person's life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or where it is more likely than not that the person would be tortured.  See paragraph 36 below for reporting channel instructions. (f) Persons seeking resettlement (including "asylum") in the United States.  See Section E (paragraphs 40-52) below and Ref E for additional guidance on such cases. (g) Persons granted temporary refuge.  See paragraphs 50-52 for instructions on reporting such cases.  35.  (S/NF) Security threat information reportable per paragraph 34(a) above should be reported via TERREP or TERREP exclusive channel telegram (as appropriate) as soon as possible.  Threat information of an extremely urgent nature should be provided to the RSO and other appropriate post officials immediately and relayed to the DS Command Center (DSCC) at (571) 345-3146 or via DSCC secure line at (571) 345-7793.  36.  (S/NF) Cases involving threats of involuntary return as described in paragraph 34(e) above should be brought to the Department's attention immediately, by phone, email or cable slugged for PRM/A, with U.S. Mission Geneva, attention Refugee and Migration Affairs (RMA), as an info addressee.  37.  (S/NF) Except as specified above for threat and involuntary return cases, telegrams should be sent through normal channels, be slugged for INR/CCS, P, DS/CI, and the appropriate regional bureau, and describe the time-sensitivity of the case.  INR/CCS is the action office and will distribute to other bureaus as appropriate.  In extremely sensitive cases, post should send a Roger Channel telegram to INR/CCS, which will ensure appropriate, limited distribution.  38.  (S/NF) If the case may require consideration of U.S. resettlement options, posts may also wish to slug PRM/A, DRL/MLGA, L/HRR, and CA/VO, and to add DHS/USCIS WASHDC as an info addressee.  39.  (S/NF) All telegrams should use the PINR and ASEC tags.  CVIS and PREF tags also should be used in potential resettlement cases.  All telegrams referring to UNHCR should add U.S. Mission Geneva, attention Refugee and Migration Affairs (RMA), as an info addressee.  Section E.  TEMPORARY REFUGE - CAUTIONS AND GUIDANCE  40.  (S/NF) Walk-ins sometimes request that they be permitted to remain in an embassy or other USG facility beyond closing hours.  The Department considers this a request for temporary refuge, not a request for asylum, and post officials should be particularly careful not to equate the two.  In U.S. immigration law, asylum is a status granted to qualified refugees, and an application for "asylum" can only be made in the United States.  A walk-in may request "asylum" in an embassy based on the erroneous belief that safe passage out of the host country will be assured if the request is granted. While a few mostly Latin American countries recognize such a right of "diplomatic asylum," the United States and most other countries do not recognize that concept or accept that the granting of refuge in an embassy is an authorized use of diplomatic facilities.  A walk-in who requests "asylum" may also in substance be requesting an opportunity to resettle in the United States; guidance on such requests is below under long-term options.  41.  (S/NF) Granting a walk-in temporary refuge in an embassy or other USG facility may actually increase the danger to an individual, particularly in hostile countries and if the individual is a host-country national.  The longer the person remains, the more likely the host government will become aware of the request for temporary refuge and possibly take retaliatory action.  In hostile countries, the United States generally is unable either to assure a walk-in's safe conduct out of the country or continued safety in the country once they leave post premises.  Thus granting temporary refuge may lead to a protracted stalemate, with the walk-in effectively residing in post premises. "Residence within a post" of persons hostile to the host government could be a continuing source of controversy and lead to serious adverse effects on U.S. interests and unexpected financial implications for the post.  42.  (U) In light of these factors, all foreign national walk-ins seeking refuge in a USG facility should be informed that post cannot ensure (a) their safe conduct out of the host country; (b) their future safety within the host country; or (c) their entry into the United States.  They should also be informed that they may actually endanger their own welfare or interests by remaining at post.  43.  (S/NF) Temporary refuge may never be granted to foreign nationals who simply wish to immigrate to the United States or evade local criminal law; if granting refuge would put post security in jeopardy; or if the Department instructs post not to do so.  44.  (S/NF) Post should use appropriate measures to remove a person seeking refuge from the premises when temporary refuge is not warranted.  45.  (S/NF) Only the COM or Principal Officer, or a person designated to act on their behalf in their absence, may grant a request for temporary refuge.  46.  (S/NF) Temporary refuge may be granted only if there is compelling evidence that the walk-in is in imminent physical danger for any reason, or in imminent danger of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  47.  (S/NF) Within the kinds of cases described in paragraph 46, post should grant temporary refuge in those rare situations in which an individual faces not just imminent physical danger, but immediate and exceptionally grave physical danger, i.e., possible death or serious bodily injury, either in the host country or in another country to which the individual will be summarily returned by host- country authorities.  48.  (S/NF) Also within the kinds of cases described in paragraph 46, post may at its discretion grant temporary refuge if the physical danger or the danger of involuntary repatriation as defined above is less serious but appears imminent. In determining if granting temporary refuge is appropriate in such instances, post should consider the following questions:  (a) How serious and immediate is the threat to the walk-in? (b) Will the threat to the individual increase or decrease if the walk-in is allowed to remain at post? (c) Can the individual leave or be required to leave post without being noticed? (d) If detection by host government authorities is inevitable and the alleged threat is from the host government, can the walk-in's presence and subsequent departure be explained in a manner that will not further endanger the individual? (e) What are the likely consequences of allowing the individual to temporarily remain at the post with regards to the individual, other persons in the host country, the security of the post, and the safety of U.S. Government personnel? (f) Is the individual of intelligence value to the United States? (g) Is the person facing immediate and exceptionally grave physical danger on account of peaceful political, religious, or humanitarian activities consistent with U.S. values and policies?  49.  (C/NF) Temporary refuge generally should not be granted at residential diplomatic or consular premises.  The inviolability of diplomatic residences (except the COM's) is linked to the diplomat's residency and may be lost if the host government declares persona non grata (PNG) the diplomat whose residence is involved. Consular residences do not enjoy inviolability (unless it is provided by special agreement). As a practical matter all residences, whether diplomatic or consular, are generally less secure than the embassy or consulate.  50.  (C) If temporary refuge is granted, post should notify the Department in an appropriately classified "NIACT Immediate" precedence telegram and should notify other relevant overseas posts by immediate precedence telegram.  Telegrams to the Department should be slugged for INR/CCS, P, PRM/A, L/HRR, L/DL, DSCC, DRL/MLGA, CA/VO, and the appropriate regional bureau.  DHS/USCIS WASHDC should be a direct telegraphic info addressee. Post also should notify the Department by telegram if temporary refuge is requested but denied, unless the case is clearly without merit, e.g., appeals by a drunken or deranged person.  51.  (S/NF) If the host government (or the government of the alien's nationality, if the individual is a third-country national) requests an interview with a walk-in who is granted temporary refuge, post should notify the Department and await guidance.  Post should not/not comply with such interview requests unless explicitly authorized to do so by the Department.  52.  (SBU) If granted, temporary refuge should be terminated as soon as circumstances permit (e.g., when the period of active danger ends), but only with Department authorization.  Post management should inform the Department (to the same addressees listed in paragraph 50) when temporary refuge is terminated.  A person who has been granted temporary refuge may, of course, leave voluntarily whenever he/she wishes.  Post management should reasonably ensure that the decision to leave is voluntary.  Section F.  LONG-TERM OPTIONS  53.  (U) Walk-ins often wish to resettle in the United States, but this may not be appropriate or possible.  The United States encourages local or regional resettlement of refugees and international resettlement burden-sharing among many governments.  54.  (C/NF) In routine cases involving walk-ins from third countries who may be refugees, the walk- in should be referred to the host government for adjudication of his or her status as long as the host country has satisfactory asylum or refugee- processing procedures.  In most cases, potential refugees should also be referred to the local office of the UNHCR, especially if local refugee/asylum procedures are not available.  UNHCR is mandated to provide protection for refugees and has primary international responsibility for seeking durable solutions for refugees, including possible opportunities for third-country resettlement.  This mandate extends to UNHCR even in countries that are not party to any of the treaties just mentioned.  Where there is no UNHCR office, UNHCR's responsibilities are normally handled by the local UNDP office.  Beware, however, that in some countries UNHCR (or UNDP) may be placed in an awkward position if it is notified of a case and there is a need to conceal the case from the host government.  If this possibility exists, post should approach UNHCR or UNDP discreetly.  55.  (C/NF) If it appears that entry into the United States is the appropriate long-term solution to a walk-in's situation, the walk-in should not be issued a non-immigrant visa except in unusual circumstances after consultation with the Department.  Non-immigrant admission will generally not be appropriate because the circumstances that lead an individual to become a walk-in normally lead also to ineligibility under section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as an intending immigrant.  Admission to the United States therefore normally should be as a refugee or parolee.  In some circumstances an immigrant visa may also be available.  REFUGEE ADMISSION  56.  (U) A person outside the United States may be granted refugee admission if he or she qualifies as a "refugee" as defined in U.S. law and meets other applicable requirements.  DHS has sole responsibility for adjudicating applications for refugee admission outside the United States. DHS/USCIS officers determine whether or not an individual is a refugee on a case-by-case basis after a personal interview.  To qualify, a person must normally be outside his country.  Given adequate justification, however, DHS may adjudicate an "in country" refugee application when requested by a U.S. Ambassador with the concurrence of PRM/A and DHS/USCIS in Washington.  See Ref F, entitled "How a post can refer cases to the U.S. refugee admissions program", and Ref G, entitled "Worldwide processing priority system for FY 2010", for more information.  57.  (U) The U.S. definition of "refugee" encompasses a person who, under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, is outside his or her country of nationality (or, if he or she has no nationality, the country of last habitual residence) and has experienced past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution in that country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. U.S. law deems the following persons to have been persecuted on account of political opinion: a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure, or for other resistance to a coercive population control program; a person who has a well-founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or be persecuted for such failure, refusal, or resistance.  58.  (U) Persons admitted to the United States as refugees are eligible for initial reception and placement assistance from non-government organizations (NGOs) funded under cooperative agreements with PRM and for other publicly funded benefits.  59.  (U) If the host government cannot or will not protect the individual from involuntary repatriation and UNHCR is unable to intervene, and post believes that the person may qualify as a refugee, post should contact PRM/A for guidance on how to proceed.  PAROLE  60.  (S/NF) Foreign nationals may also travel to the United States pursuant to the Secretary of Homeland Security's parole authority under Section 212(d)(5) of the INA.  Parole may be granted based on humanitarian or significant public benefit grounds.  Authority over humanitarian parole requests rests with DHS/USCIS/RAIO/HAB.  Authority over Significant Public Benefit Parole (SPBP) rests with DHS/ICE.  DHS/ICE/OIA-LEPB has developed guidelines in consultation with the Department for the processing of SPBP cases.  Guidelines for both types of parole are contained in Ref H.  61.  (S/NF) Use of parole for a walk-in may be warranted in extraordinary cases, such as when no other resolution appears feasible and a walk-in is of special interest to the United States, when a walk-in is in immediate danger, or when the case is politically sensitive.  If post wishes to pursue parole for a walk-in, it must submit a request by telegram, slugged for INR/CCS, CA/VO/F/P, DRL/MLGA, P, and the appropriate regional bureau.  An info copy should go to the appropriate DHS bureau. The telegram must provide justification for the request; include a certification by the COM or the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) that the information provided is complete and accurate; and identify all interested agencies at post that were involved in reviewing and endorsing the request.  A "CLASS" name check must be completed, and all required Security Advisory Opinion requests (SAOs) must be submitted.  The results of the "CLASS" name check should be indicated in the cable.  62.  (U) All financial arrangements for parolees must be made in advance.  Post should not make any guarantees of such assistance, but should maintain a list of possible local sponsors that might be willing to assist (e.g., church groups or social service agencies in the United States), to contact in urgent situations if the parolee first agrees and signs a statement authorizing disclosure of his/her identity and situation to persons outside the U.S. Government.  In some cases the Department may also be able to help by contacting private organizations in the United States to assist parolees upon arrival.  DEFECTORS  63.  (S/NF) For the purpose of this telegram, the term "defector" refers to a person of any nationality (usually from a country whose interests are hostile or inimical to those of the United States) who has escaped from the control of their home country and is of special interest to the U.S. Government.  Defector cases generally are handled under parole procedures.  The GRPO will work out these arrangements with DHS/ICE and/or post's consular section once Washington's approval is obtained.  The LEGATT should be notified of defector status as soon as practicable.  Section G.  TRAVEL ASSISTANCE  64.  (S/NF) If the appropriate agencies decide that a walk-in should be allowed to travel to the United States (in any of the capacities described above), transportation out of the host country and to the United States must be arranged.  Transportation out of friendly countries should not pose a problem. Post should take appropriate steps, in coordination with the host government, to ensure that the individual is permitted to travel and protected from possible adverse actions (e.g., by their country of nationality).  If the individual lacks means to pay for transportation, post should consult with the Department regarding options. Approved refugees are eligible for a transportation loan administered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) (the recipient will be responsible for eventual repayment).

Feltman for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 3-5.  SUMMARY -------  2.  (C) Iran's continued reluctance to cooperate with international efforts to build confidence and transparency in its nuclear program will be of increasing concern to U.S. diplomacy in the weeks ahead. Of particular note is Iran's apparent refusal to date to agree to an IAEA proposal for Iran to exchange a significant portion of its stockpiled low-enriched uranium (LEU) for fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), and the IAEA report of November 16 indicating serious unresolved questions about Iran's nuclear intentions.  Department requests posts to draw on the attached narrative in explaining and securing support for recent U.S. and P5+1 efforts to engage Iran on its nuclear program, particularly in the lead-up to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on November 26.  End Summary.   OBJECTIVES ----------  3.  (C) FOR ALL POSTS (except Moscow, Paris, Beijing, London and Berlin):  Please draw on narrative beginning in paragraph 7, and hard questions and answers in paragraph 12 to brief host governments on:  -- Persistent U.S. efforts to engage Iran throughout 2009;  -- Iran's disappointing follow-up to its commitments with P5+1 in Geneva on October 1;  -- Details of the TRR proposal and the flexibility the U.S., Russia, France and the IAEA, have demonstrated to deal with Iranian concerns; and  -- Key findings and implications of the IAEA Director General's November 16 report on Iran; and  Posts should also begin laying the foundation for possible future action in response to Iran's non- cooperation, including at the IAEA (BoG) meeting on 26 November and prudent preparation in the event of a decision to pursue increased pressure on Iran.  4.  (C) SPECIAL REQUEST FOR MOSCOW, PARIS, BEIJING, LONDON, AND BERLIN:  Please inform host government that we are delivering this message to IAEA members, consistent with consultations among Political Directors in the P5+1 process.  Posts may share the general tenor of our message but do not need to deploy the points themselves with host governments.  5.  (C) Posts should not leave any part of this message in writing with host governments.  DEADLINE --------  6.  (U) Posts should report the results of their efforts by November 25. Elisa Catalano (NEA/FO, 202-647-9533, CatalanoE@state.sgov.gov) and Richard Nephew (ISN/RA, 202-647-7680, NephewRM@state.sgov.gov) are the Department's POCs for this activity.  BACKGROUND ----------  7.  (SBU) Since the 1 October 2009 meeting of the P5+1 Political Directors and representatives from Iran, the United States has been working closely with its partners to fulfill the commitments reached in Geneva and engage with Iran to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  In particular, we have focused on supporting the IAEA's proposal for refueling the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), facilitating the IAEA's inspection of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Qom, and pressing for a follow-on meeting between P5+1 Political Directors and Iranian representatives explicitly on  STATE 00120288  002 OF 008   Iran's nuclear program.  8.  (C) The results since October 1 have been disappointing.  It increasingly appears that Iran will decline the IAEA's proposal on TRR, though a definitive answer remains outstanding.  In the lead-up to the IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) meeting on November 26, Iran may try to blame the apparent failure of the TRR agreement on intrusive and inflexible demands by western powers, rather than its own reluctance or inability to reach agreement on the IAEA proposal which responded to Iran's request for assistance and was created on the basis of Iran's own commitments made in Geneva. Although Iran granted IAEA access to Qom, Iran did not cooperate with all of the IAEA's requests for access to information and personnel and there remain serious questions about Iran's intentions for the facility. Finally, Iran so far has refused a further meeting with the P5+1 to discuss its nuclear program.  The United States is now discussing with its P5+1 and other partners potential next steps, including how to handle these issues at the next meeting of the IAEA BOG.  9. (SBU) IAEA Director General (DG) ElBaradei released his latest report on Iran on November 16.  The report makes clear Iran's continuing lack of transparency and cooperation with the IAEA on its nuclear program, including in assessing a possible military dimension to its program.  As expected, the uranium enrichment facility at Qom (also known as the Fordow site) was a central element of the report, and the IAEA states that Iran's previous failure to declare the facility is "inconsistent" with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement. The IAEA's report highlights that revelation of the Qom facility raises concerns of additional clandestine nuclear sites in Iran and has asked Iran to confirm that there are no other undeclared nuclear facilities; Iran has yet to respond to this IAEA request.  Iran continues to defy UNSC resolutions and IAEA BOG resolutions calling on it to adopt the Additional Protocol and to provide the access necessary for the IAEA to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities.  10.  (C) The P5+1 "dual track" policy towards Iran includes both engagement and pressure if Iran does not engage constructively.  President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and others have identified the end of the year as a key period for assessing Iran's responsiveness.  If Iran continues to refuse to take meaningful steps to meet its international obligations, the international community must be prepared to take strong collective action on the pressure track.  KEY DIPLOMATIC MESSAGES AND POLICY NARRATIVE --------------------------------------------  11.  (U) Posts should draw on the following key messages and policy narrative in briefing host governments.  Key Messages ------------  -- We, in coordination with our international partners, have demonstrated our willingness to engage constructively and respectfully with Iran to address long-standing international concerns over its nuclear program.  Our approach has clearly and consistently been based on the P5+1's dual track strategy.  -- Iran so far has failed to accept a very good and balanced IAEA proposal to facilitate the refueling of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) which would have fulfilled an Iranian request, addressed a humanitarian need of the Iranian people, and served as a confidence- building step to create an opportunity for further progress.  -- We look forward to close consultations on how best to persuade Iran to engage constructively as we approach the IAEA's Board of Governors meeting on November 26 and beyond.  Policy Narrative ----------------  -- Since President Obama took office, he has made clear the willingness of the United States to engage with Iran and to seek a new relationship based on mutual respect.  -- He has authorized the United States' full participation in diplomatic discussions between the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany  STATE 00120288  003 OF 008   and Iran without pre-conditions.  -- The United States has stated its support for Iran's full right to a civilian nuclear program within IAEA guidelines, provided Iran meets it international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the NPT framework.  -- As a way to build confidence, the United States, with Russia and France, has also supported the IAEA's proposal to positively respond to Iran's request for nuclear fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), in spite of Iran's continuing violation of UNSC resolutions and noncompliance with IAEA requirements on its nuclear program.  -- However, almost one year into the Obama administration, Iran has not taken practical, concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions.  Iran:  o       Continues to enrich uranium despite UNSC requirements that it suspend such operations; o       Revealed it had been building a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near Qom, in violation of its safeguards agreement ; o       Continues to refuse cooperation with the IAEA in addressing the full range of IAEA questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program; o       Has not accepted the IAEA proposal to refuel the TRR; and o       Since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany in Geneva on October 1, has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program.  -- Iran's failure to take advantage of these numerous opportunities raises serious questions about the intentions of its nuclear program that deserve urgent international attention.  We look to work closely with your government in the run-up to IAEA Board of Governors meeting on November 26 and beyond to develop an appropriate international response.  Tehran Research Reactor -----------------------  -- The IAEA, Russia, France and the United States cooperated closely and flexibly to find a way to positively respond to Iran's request for fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) so that it could keep running to meet humanitarian medical needs beyond 2010.  -- The TRR refueling proposal offers Iran the opportunity to convert its stockpile of low enriched uranium (LEU) into higher-enriched fuel with the help of Russia and France.  The proposal's elements are simple:  o       Iran would transfer a portion of its LEU necessary for fuel production in one batch to IAEA custody outside of Iran before the end of the year; o       Russia would further enrich the LEU to meet fuel requirements; and o       France would fabricate the fuel assemblies and return them to Iran before Iran's fuel supplies are depleted before the end of the year.  -- In addition the United States expressed a commitment to work with the IAEA to improve safety and control features at the TRR.  -- The U.S., France and Russia took great risks in supporting the deal, especially in light of Iran's continuing violation of successive UNSC resolutions and IAEA requirements, including its secret construction of a uranium enrichment facility near Qom, and its continuing enrichment operations.  -- We did so because the arrangement would begin to build confidence and would give Iran and the international community more time to reach a comprehensive negotiated solution to Iran's nuclear program, while fulfilling Iran's humanitarian needs.  -- When Iran expressed concern about the reliability of the proposal, the United States and its partners expressed to the IAEA a willingness to address Iran's concerns, including through:  o       a U.S. offer to formally join the deal as a signatory;  STATE 00120288  004 OF 008   o       a readiness of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany to guarantee the deal through a political statement of support; o       a willingness to help secure finance for the movement of the LEU and fuel; o       an openness to move the LEU to any number of locations outside of Iran; and o       a willingness to support the IAEA's holding material equivalent to the fuel in escrow in a third country as a guarantee for Iran of the fuel's ultimate delivery.  -- After reaching an agreement in principle in the deal following talks with the E3+3 in Geneva on October 1, and following further technical discussions at the IAEA October 19-21, Iran has so far failed to accept the deal.  -- This raises a question about Iran's intentions.  If Iran is enriching uranium to meet its civilian reactor fuel needs, why would it not accept an international offer (with significant guarantees) to provide its LEU for fuel to power the TRR to meet its humanitarian needs, particularly when it does not have the capability to produce the fuel on its own?  -- This question is troubling in the context of Iran's continued enrichment activities in defiance of UNSC resolutions; its secret construction of an enrichment facility on a military base near Qom; its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA in answering questions about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program; and its refusal to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council.  P5+1 ----  -- Together with our P5+1 partners, the United States informed Iranian representatives in Geneva on October 1 of our willingness to discuss any items of concern to Iran - both bilaterally and multilaterally - in addition to our concerns about Iran's nuclear program.  -- On October 1, Iran's representatives committed to meet again before the end of the month based on an agenda that included Iran's nuclear program.  Since that time, however, the Iranian government has refused all invitations to meet if its nuclear program would be on the agenda.  -- Iran's continued refusal to engage on its nuclear program with the P5+1 deepens our concerns about Iran's intentions for its nuclear program.  The IAEA Director General's Report on Iran ------------------------------------------  -- The IAEA report makes clear that Iran has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the IAEA.  Key aspects of the report include:  ---- Iran's new centrifuge facility at Qom - built in violation of Iran's UNSC obligations and not declared to the IAEA as required - has been inspected, but its purpose and origin remain unknown.  And, Iran has not yet cooperated with all of the IAEA's requests for access to information and personnel.  Iran's failure to provide the IAEA with early design information regarding the Qom facility has been deemed "inconsistent with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement" by the IAEA.  Furthermore, the relatively small size of the facility at Qom is inconsistent with Iran's assertion that it is to provide fuel for Iran's civilian reactors, raising questions about the planned use of the Qom facility.  ---- The Agency noted that Iran's failure to declare the Qom facility also "reduces the level of confidence in the absence of other nuclear facilities under construction and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities in Iran that had not been declared to the Agency."  ---- These concerns have been compounded by the continued pace of Iranian enrichment and steadfast refusal to abide by the UNSC's legal requirement that Iran suspend all such work.  Instead, Iran continues to produce low enriched uranium and estimated its stockpile at 1763 kilograms at the end of October. Notwithstanding a reduction in the number of enriching centrifuges by approximately 600 since August 2009, this is roughly a similar rate of production as Iran has  STATE 00120288  005 OF 008   achieved for the past year.  ---- Iran continues to install and test additional centrifuges, with more than 1,000 new centrifuges added since August 2009.  ---- The IAEA has discovered a previously unknown cache of heavy water in storage at Esfahan, and has requested Iran to explain its origin.  It is important to note that UN Security Council resolutions include a ban on supplying Iran with heavy water.  ---- It also asked Iran to provide further information describing an analytical laboratory that Iran says it plans to install underground at Esfahan.  ---- There has been no progress made in addressing issues associated with Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, despite a year having passed since the last such conversation and many open questions that surround this work.  -- If Iran wishes to begin to resolve international concerns, it should comply with its international obligations, cooperate fully with the IAEA, grant the access requested (such as to individuals and workshops associated with past weaponization efforts, and to individuals responsible for managing Qom), and answer the questions it has been asked.  Iran has created this confidence deficit and it is up to Iran to restore the international community's trust.  Next Steps ----------  -- The United States and its partners believe that the troubling questions surrounding Iran's nuclear program deserve the full and urgent attention of the international community.  -- We look forward to working with your government to promote the active involvement of the IAEA and the international community in addressing these unresolved questions.  -- We will be in touch with you in the days ahead to share ideas on how to approach the issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting that will begin on November 26.  -- Beyond the Board of Governors meeting, we would also like to intensify our consultations on next appropriate steps in the international community based on the dual track policy (engagement and pressure) to persuade Iran to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations.  HARD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS --------------------------  12. (U) We have also compiled the following questions and answers to draw from should Posts require them:  On The TRR Proposal -------------------  -- Why must Iran surrender all of its LEU in one batch, and why must it be before the end of the year?  o       The TRR proposal was developed both to supply Iran with the fuel required for the continued operation of the reactor, and also as a measure to build confidence in Iran's peaceful intentions and its seriousness to negotiate with the E3+3. o       By agreeing to the transfer of 1200 kilograms of LEU (enough to equal the last fuel supply agreement Iran signed for the reactor with Argentina in the early 1990s), we aimed to lessen international concerns that Iran was attempting to create a stockpile of uranium to contribute to an eventual breakout from the NPT.  This would consequently allow more time for negotiations with the E3+3 on the broader nuclear file. o       The transfer by the end of the year is needed to ensure that Iran receives the fuel required for the reactor before December 2010, when the reactor will run out and be forced to shut down.  -- What risk does the LEU stored in Iran pose to the international community?  Isn't it under full IAEA monitoring?  o       Yes, this LEU is currently under IAEA safeguards.  STATE 00120288  006 OF 008   o       However, given Iran's long history of IAEA safeguards violations and NPT noncompliance, the international community cannot trust that Iran will not interfere with IAEA monitoring or withdraw from IAEA safeguards or the NPT altogether. o       This project will remove an immediate source of concern and establish some confidence in Iran's peaceful intent and willingness to comply with its obligations.  -- How can Iran be sure it will ever receive the fuel assemblies for the TRR in the current international environment, in which many openly seek to diminish Iran's nuclear capacity?  o       We and our E3+3 partners have each made political commitments at the highest levels to the fulfillment of this project.  Should Iran agree to it, Iran will receive the fuel required. o       All participants in this project are taking risks.  Iran stands in violation of the NPT, its IAEA safeguards agreement, and three Chapter VII UNSC resolutions.  This project offers Iran an opportunity to establish confidence in its peaceful intentions, a confidence that has eroded due to Iran's continued non-compliance.  -- Can Iran simply purchase the fuel from an international supplier, as some have advocated in Iran? o       The UN Security Council resolutions do permit Iran to Iran can purchase low-enriched fuel from an international supplier if it wishes. o       However, we are confident Iran would not find a willing supplier given the concerns surrounding its nuclear program and its continued defiance of the international community. o       Outside of the context of the IAEA proposal before Iran, we would oppose such a deal.  -- How would the E3+3 respond if Iran announced it had "no choice" but to make its own fuel for the TRR? o       Under three UN Security Council resolutions, Iran is required to suspend all uranium enrichment- related activities.  We have offered Iran a way to secure the necessary TRR fuel without further violating these obligations.  Enrichment activities to produce its own fuel for the TRR would be a violation of current UNSCRs. o       Further, Iran is not currently able to produce the fuel. Reconfiguration of Iranian centrifuges to produce the required enrichment level (19.75%) would cause serious international concern and could permit Iran to produce a stockpile of even greater enriched uranium than it has currently (Iran's current enrichment level is 3.5%).  This would increase the risk of a near-term Iranian breakout from the NPT and sprint to producing nuclear weapons.  On Demands to Suspend Enrichment --------------------------------  -- Iran suspended enrichment once before in response to international demands, and received no benefit.  Why should Iran trust the international community now?  o       Iran's suspension of uranium enrichment and other activities in the past was intended to support a diplomatic process.  Unfortunately, Iran terminated that diplomatic process in August 2005 by abandoning suspension. o       However, prior to that point, Iran's temporary suspension avoided its being reported to the UN Security Council and the sanctions that would have likely come along with that report. o       The requirement of suspension imposed by the UNSC in resolution 1737 is intended to restore that diplomatic process and to lead to a final resolution of international concerns with Iran's nuclear program. o       This was codified in UNSCR 1737 when the UNSC stated its intention to suspend implementation of the measures adopted by the UNSC if Iran returned to negotiations through suspension of its nuclear and related activities. o       Trust is in short supply on both sides.  It is for that reason that we have offered Iran several opportunities for reciprocal, confidence-building steps (e.g., "freeze for freeze" and the TRR proposal).  -- What about recent reports indicating the Iranian  STATE 00120288  007 OF 008   enrichment program has not grown. What is the significance of this stagnation?  o       Iran has slowed or scaled back the enrichment program several times since the project became public in 2002. o       There are many possible explanations for the stagnation of the Iranian enrichment program, including technical issues with the centrifuges and general system maintenance. o       Regardless of Iran's lack of progress in its enrichment program, it continues to enrich and stockpile LEU. This activity in violation of three United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for full suspension of its nuclear and enrichment related activities, and increases the risk of a near-term Iranian breakout from the NPT and sprint to producing nuclear weapons.  Israel's Nuclear Program ------------------------  -- Why is there not equal attention to Israel's nuclear status?  Does it not also destabilize the region? o       The United States has long supported universal adherence to the NPT treaty and  continues to believe that all states that have not done so should join the Treaty and accept the full-scope IAEA safeguards on all of their nuclear activities. o       It is extremely difficult, however, to make this case to a non-NPT state when its neighbors are in violation of their own NPT obligations, and when the international community has not demonstrated the political will necessary to enforce compliance. o       Iran's failure to comply with its NPT and IAEA obligations bears out these concerns and undermines attempts to secure universal adherence to the NPT.  It became a party to the treaty and proceeded to violate its obligations under it for over twenty years, presenting a fundamental threat to the entire nonproliferation regime. o       Returning regional states to full compliance with their NPT obligations would be an important step toward NPT adherence by all states in the region. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability also serves as a destabilizing factor in the region, possibly triggering proliferation across the Gulf in response to a mounting threat posed by Iran.  Not only does this undermine the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime, but risks further instability in the region.  Qom Facility ------------  -- How can you say that the Qom facility was secret, when it was Iran that announced its existence and invited IAEA inspectors to visit?  o       Iran was required to declare the existence of this facility to the IAEA the moment the decision was made to construct it, not several years into its construction.  This is a requirement of Iran's IAEA Safeguards Agreement (contained in Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangement to Iran's Safeguards Agreement). o       This code was modified after revelations surrounding Iraq's nuclear program were made in the early 1990s. o       Iran was the last state to agree to the revised code, but it did so in March 2003.  Iran attempted to revert to the early form of the code (which requires notification only 180 days prior to the introduction of nuclear to the facility) in March 2007.  The IAEA consistently has rejected that Iran has the legal ability to make such a change. o       We also believe that Iran made the decision to declare the facility not to conform to its legal obligations, but because it had become aware that the secrecy of the facility had been compromised.  -- Iran claims it needs such a hardened facility as Fordu because for years both the US and Israel have threatened to bomb its nuclear sites. Is it not surprising Iran would try to keep its location a secret to have an emergency back-up facility?  O Iran's own failure to meet its obligations for transparency and IAEA monitoring of sensitive nuclear installations is the cause for the  STATE 00120288  008 OF 008   international community's concerns that surrounding its nuclear program. o       Iran's decision to construct yet another clandestine site only deepens these concerns.  P5+1 ----  -- Why should Iran discuss its nuclear program with the self-appointed P5+1?  Isn't the IAEA the proper place for Iran to engage on its nuclear program with the international community?  O  We welcome Iran's engagement with the IAEA.  But despite its rhetoric, Iran has not engaged with the IAEA.  Iran has refused for several years to answer the IAEA's questions (even before the IAEA reported Iran to the UNSC for its myriad violations of its international obligations). o       The E3+3 mechanism evolved as a means to negotiate a solution precisely because Iran was refusing to engage with the IAEA on the concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program.

Embassy Berlin, please see paragraph 4.  2. (S) Background and Objective:  We want to advise German officials of information indicating that as of June 2009, two Iranian intermediary firms offered test equipment manufactured by the German firms Rohde & Schwarz and Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik (HBM) to Iran's primary developer of liquid-fueled ballistic missiles, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG). While this equipment is not controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it could be used in ballistic missile testing applications.  Moreover, SHIG made specific requests for items manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz and HBM, and goods produced by the two firms were the targets of previous, long-running procurement efforts by SHIG and the Iranian procurement network Farazeh Equipment Distributor Company (FEDCO, which may have been acting on behalf of SHIG) (Refs).  In both cases, German officials investigated the information we provided and sensitized the firms to their concerns.  (Note: In the HBM case, the company reported that it did receive a request from Evertop Services (a FEDCO affiliate), but that the request was rejected.  End note.)  We want to share this new information with German officials and encourage them to continue their efforts to prevent SHIG or other Iranian entities of proliferation concern from procuring sensitive items from Rohde & Schwarz and HBM.  3.  Action Request: Request Embassy Berlin approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper.  4.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:  (SECRET//REL GERMANY)  -- We would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your assistance in investigating this activity.  -- Between 2007 and 2009, we discussed with you on numerous occasions information indicating that Iranian entities of proliferation concern were seeking equipment manufactured by the German firms Rohde & Schwarz and Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik (HBM).  -- Specifically, we advised you that the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG, Iran's primary developer of liquid fueled ballistic missiles) and entities affiliated with the Farazeh Equipment Distributor Company (FEDCO) were engaged in efforts to procure Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment.  -- We were pleased to subsequently hear that German officials had sensitized representatives of both firms to proliferation concerns related to SHIG and FEDCO, and that HBM had rejected a request from Evertop Services, an entity affiliated with FEDCO.  -- We now want to share with you related information indicating that as of June 2009, SHIG was seeking test equipment via Iranian intermediaries from both Rohde & Schwarz and HBM.  -- Specifically, we understand that the Tehran-based Heydari Ofogh Sanat Anvar Company offered SHIG an ESIB model electromagnetic interference test receiver and spectrum analyzer manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz.  -- We also understand that the Iranian company Hamim Commercial offered SHIG pressure transducers and other equipment produced by HBM.  -- While this equipment is not controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it could be used in ballistic missile testing applications.  -- We do not know if the Iranian intermediaries are already in possession of the Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment, but wanted to make you aware of the fact that Iran's missile program made specific requests for items manufactured by these German firms.  -- We also want to reiterate that SHIG often conducts its business through front companies and middlemen posing as end users.  -- Given SHIG's interest in this equipment and the previous Iranian efforts to acquire Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment, we wanted to share this latest information with you, and urge you to continue your work to prevent these firms from acting, even unwittingly, as suppliers to SHIG and other Iranian entities of proliferation concern.  -- We look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation on nonproliferation matters and to hearing of any updates related to this case.  5.

(SBU) This is an action request for Posts in Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Kuwait City, Manama, and Riyadh.  Please see para 7.  Summary and Background ------------------------------------------  2. (C) Posts are requested to raise with appropriate government officials our concerns about Russian plans to transfer the S-300 long-range air-defense system to Iran. Washington would like these governments to immediately and directly raise this issue  with their Russian counterparts arguing that such a transfer could significantly enhance Iran's air defense capability; increase regional instability; and reward Iran at a time when Iran is undermining security with its nuclear pursuits and support for terrorism.  3.  (S//NF) Over the past few years, the Russian Government has told the USG that, while it has a contract to supply the S-300 air-defense system to Iran, the transfer would not be completed until Iran complied with its international nuclear obligations.  USG suspicions were piqued during a February 12 meeting when Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov brushed off U/S Burns concerns over such a transfer, but did not reiterate Russia,s year-long position that the S-300 transfer depends on Iranian behavior.  The Iranian Defense Minister is currently in Moscow for talks with Russia on the delivery of the S-300.  Initial press reports quote Rosoboronexport officials as saying there has been no progress in the talks to expedite delivery of the system.  Russian news media also speculates that Russia will not deliver the S-300 to Iran for fear of upsetting discussions with the new US administration.  Despite the denials in the press, we are concerned by the technical preparations for delivery of the S-300, which are complete or nearing completion.  It appears that there is a need for action now to prevent a senior-level political decision to allow the delivery to go foward.  4. (C) Though Russia states that the S-300 is "defensive" in nature, the mobile system could be used to support offensive operations.  S-300s located on Iranian territory would have the range to engage targets well beyond Iran,s borders into Persian Gulf and Iraqi airspace, threatening U.S. and regional partners.  5. (SBU) UNSCR 1747, passed on March 24, 2007, urged all states to exercise "vigilance and restraint in the supply, sale or transfer" of a broad range of conventional weapons as defined for the purpose of the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms to Iran.  While the S-300 does not technically meet the definition within the UN Register for any of the categories of items listed in paragraph 6 of UNSCR 1747, transfers of this type of system to Iran seriously undercut the primary objective of UNSCR 1747 to further press Iran to comply with the UNSCR 1737 requirement to suspend its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the IAEA.  6.  (C) We have selected action addressee posts to engage the GOR because we maintain strong bilateral relationships and share common security interests, but also because we believe these governments have potential leverage with Russia.  In particular,  Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have increased their political-military cooperation with Russia. These countries can legitimately make the point to Moscow that they cannot have a close political-military partnership with Russia, while Russia strengthens the hand of Iran, arguably the greatest threat to each of these nation's security.  Suggested Talking Points -----------------------------------------  7.  (SBU) Posts are requested to approach appropriate host government officials regarding the possible transfer of the S-300 air-defense system from Russia to Iran.   Post should draw from the following talking points.  --In the spirit of our bilateral cooperation, we request your government,s support in urging Russia to not transfer a highly sophisticated air defense system to Iran.  --In 2005 Russia signed a contract to sell the modern long-range S-300 air defense missile system to Iran.  -- In 2006, after it was exposed that Iran was not in compliance with its international nuclear obligations, Russia assured us, it would not complete the transfer until Iran changed course.  --Despite these assurances, we are concerned that Russia is in a position to deliver the S-300 to Iran as soon as a political decision is taken.  --Moreover, when we raised our concerns in recent senior-level conversations with Russian officials, we were not reassured by the Russian response.  --We request that you use your influence with Russia to sharpen their decision against a transfer at this time.  --Though Russia has categorized the S-300 as defensive in nature, it is a mobile system that can easily used to support offensive operations.  --The most modern variant of the S-300, high-performance surface-to-air missile system would greatly improve Iran,s ability to defend large regions of its airspace up to 200 km beyond its borders.  --With Iran in non-compliance of its international nuclear obligations and continued meddling in regional affairs, this is not the time for Russia to engage in arms sales with Tehran.  -- We are also concerned about the implications of the transfer of an air defense system to Iran.  Such transfers would undercut the broad objective of UNSCR 1747 to increase pressure on Iran to suspend its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the IAEA by denying arms transfers to Iran.  --(If appropriate)  We believe you have particular leverage given your expanded military cooperation with Russia.  You can legitimately argue that Moscow cannot be true partners in the political-military realm while simultaneously strengthening Iran, which is arguably the greatest threat to your nation,s security.

S E C R E T STATE 016285  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2029 TAGS: KNNP PARM IAEA MNUC IR SYR TRGYSUBJECT: IAEA REPORTS ON IRAN AND SYRIA  CLASSIFIED BY: ISN - C. S. ELIOT KANG, ACTING FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D)  1.  (U) This is an action request.  See paragraphs 6-9.  ------- SUMMARY -------  2.  (SBU) International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General (DG) ElBaradei released his latest reports on the status of the IAEA's investigations into Iran and Syria's nuclear programs on 19 February 2009. Both reports conformed to expectations in describing the absence of any meaningful steps by either country to address the serious issues that exist with respect to their nuclear programs.  3.  (SBU) With respect to Iran, DG ElBaradei's description of the dichotomy between the stalled investigation and rapid pace of Iran's centrifuge advances is stark.  The report underscores the number of outstanding issues that need to be clarified regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA simply notes that it has "still not received a positive reply from Iran" regarding its request for access to relevant "information, documentation, locations or individuals."  Consequently, "the Agency has not made any substantive progress on these issues." Iran's failure to cooperate with the IAEA in this regard suggests Iran continues to wish to hide the nature of these activities.  4.  (SBU) At the same time, the IAEA reported that, far from having complied with its UNSC obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and heavy water-related activities, Iran has continued to expand its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) and Arak Heavy Water Research Reactor.  Approximately 5,500 centrifuges are operating, up from approximately 3,800 in November 2008.  Of particular concern, the IAEA notes that since February 2007, Iran has produced 1,010 kilograms of low enriched uranium (LEU), a substantial increase over the 630 kilograms reported in November 2008.  Approximately 1,300 kilograms of LEU would be sufficient for one nuclear weapon if Iran decided to go that route. Currently, this material remains under IAEA safeguards. Nevertheless, the risk posed in an Iranian breakout scenario, either from diversion of safeguarded nuclear material or through the covert enrichment of undeclared nuclear material, is higher than in the past.  Morever, Iran continues to deny the IAEA access to the Arak reactor to conduct a Design Information Verification inspection which would provide the IAEA assurances that the construction of the reactor does not serve as a pathway to divert nuclear material for weapons purposes.  5.  (SBU) DG ElBaradei's report on Syria reinforces our conclusion that Syria was engaged in a clandestine effort to construct and operate a nuclear reactor at Al Kibar.  The report also helps to confirm that uranium found via environmental samples collected at the site is not naturally occurring, lending credence to the fact that the facility in question was a reactor.  Although the report does not categorically dismiss Syria's explanation that the uranium was from Israeli missiles used in the attack on the reactor in September 2007, it suggests that this explanation is highly unlikely. Syria delivered an eleventh-hour letter on 17 February 2009 attempting to demonstrate a degree of cooperation immediately before the report's release.  The report notes that the responses in the Syrian letter "were only partial ... and did not address most of the questions raised in the Agency's communications."  Importantly, the report also calls on Syria to allow access to other locations and allow inspectors to take samples of the debris removed from Al Kibar as soon as possible, noting that these measures are "essential" for the IAEA to be able complete its assessment.  --------------- Action Requests ---------------  6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS:  Posts are requested to convey U.S. views regarding the IAEA reports to appropriate host governments.  Posts should underscore that these reports demonstrate that neither Iran nor Syria have taken any meaningful steps to cooperate with the IAEA in the past six months.  Posts should stress that Syria's refusal to do so only deepens concerns regarding the nature of its clandestine nuclear activities.  With respect to Iran, Posts should emphasize that while Iran has stalled the IAEA's investigation and still refuses to provide the IAEA with requested transparency, its centrifuge program continues to make progress.  The net result is that in neither case can the international community have confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of these nuclear programs.  For Iran, the UN Security Council has imposed a mandatory requirement that it suspend all proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the IAEA.  On Iran, we should stress that with international rights, come responsibilities.  Iran needs to live up to those responsibilities.  We believe that Iran's continued failure to do so is another opportunity lost.  7.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS CONT:  With respect to the upcoming 2-6 March 2009 IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, Posts should stress the need for the following from host governments:  -- Strong national statements on Iran and call on Iran to impement its international nuclear obligations without delay.  Statements should urge Iran to take advantage of this critical opportunity for engagement by addressing the concerns of the international community and underscore the need for full transparency with the IAEA (including Iran's implementation of the Additional Protocol) and cooperation with the IAEA's investigation, as well as suspension of all proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities;  -- Strong national statements on Syria and a demand that Syria cooperate with the IAEA's investigation;  --      Strengthened statements on Iran and Syria from regional or other groups, e.g., European Union, the Group of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of Latin America and the Carribean; the Africa Group, etc.  To the extent possible, Posts should encourage host goverments to instruct their delegations not to accept statements from any group to which they are a member that would downplay the factual reports of the IAEA, or undercut the Agency's ability to obtain the necessary information and access needed to resolve these serious issues; and,  -- Board members should support, by vote if necessary, releasing the Syria report to the public.  This is essential for the public to appreciate the serious nature of Syria's failure to cooperate with the IAEA. This report will also demonstrate the level of transparency in IAEA affairs that we believe Syria should manifest in its approach to the IAEA.  8.  (S) ACTION REQUEST FOR UNVIE:  In addition to conveying these messages to local IAEA Missions, UNVIE should continue working to promote support within the IAEA Secretariat and among IAEA Board Members for continuing and expanding the investigation into both Iran and Syria's nuclear activities and pressuring both to cooperate with the respective investigations. Mission is requested to place maximum effort into securing strong national statements demanding Iranian and Syrian cooperation with the IAEA by as many Board members as possible, particularly those in the EU. Mission should also work to support a P5+1 statement on Iran.  Mission's efforts to build support for such statements should begin as soon as possible, and will be facilitated by technical briefings on Iran and Syria's nuclear efforts to Board members in Washington and Vienna the week prior to the Board meeting.  These briefings will be provided by State and IC nonproliferation experts.  Mission is also requested to ensure that the IAEA Director General's forthcoming report on Syria is made public, including by laying the groundwork for a vote in the Board if necessary.  If possible politically and statutorily, Mission should seek the concurrent release of the November 2008 Syria report, which was denied public release by NAM/Arab intervention at the November 2008 Board meeting. Mission should begin coordinating with likeminded Board members at the earliest possible date.  9.  (S) ACTION REQUEST FOR LONDON, PARIS, MOSCOW, BERLIN, AND BEIJING:  In addition to conveying U.S. views regarding the Iran and Syria reports, Posts should stress that the United States believes that the Iran report reinforces the need for a strong P5+1 statement demanding Iran's immediate and full cooperation with the IAEA.  Discussions regarding specific texts will be addressed in Vienna and Washington.  --------------------------- POCS AND REPORTING DEADLINE ---------------------------  10.  (SBU) Mission is requested to report on the status of its efforts in advance of the Board.  Richard Nephew (202-647-7680) and Matt Goldstein (202-647-4196) are the Department's POCs for this issue.

(S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on African Great Lakes (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued DOS reporting of biographic information relating to DROC, Burundi, and Rwanda (paragraph 2).  A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supersedes the NHCD contained in Ref C and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of reporting and collection needs announced in Ref B focused on African Great Lakes.  The review produced a comprehensive list of strategic priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and update plans to collect information on African Great Lakes. We thank Kigali for its Ref A input.  The priorities should also serve as a useful tool to help the Embassy manage reporting and collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans (MSPs).  B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following each sub-issue below) in NHCDs.  C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to encourage relevant reporting through their own or State Department channels.  We appreciate Ref A response from Kigali.  2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting:  A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State reporting officers for much of the biographical information collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email and other means is vital to the community's collection efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for dissemination to the IC.  B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the following information as possible when they have information relating to persons linked to African Great Lakes: office and organizational titles; names, position titles and other information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant biographical information.  3.

REASON: 1.4(C).   1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on the West Africa Sahel region (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued DOS reporting of biographic information relating to the West Africa Sahel region (paragraph 2).  A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supercedes the NHCD contained in Ref B and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of reporting and collection needs focused on the West Africa Sahel region (Ref A).  The review produced a comprehensive list of strategic priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and update plans to collect information on the West Africa Sahel region.  The priorities should also serve as a useful tool to help the Embassy manage reporting and collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans (MSPs).  B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following each sub-issue below) in NHCDs.  C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to encourage relevant reporting through their own or State Department channels.  2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting:  A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State reporting officers for much of the biographical information collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email and other means is vital to the community's collection efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for dissemination to the IC.  B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the following information as possible when they have information relating to persons linked to the West Africa Sahel region: office and organizational titles; names, position titles and other information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant biographical information.  3. (S/NF) Priority issues and issues outline:  This directive covers eight countries of Sahelian West Africa: Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal.  The coastal countries to the south (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin) are covered separately in the West Africa Littoral directive.  I.

(S/NF) We have information the French firm Sofradir and its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to a Chinese firm for incorporation into thermal imaging systems.  We believe the Chinese firm, Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd, is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities.  Iranian military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems that rely on high-grade French infrared detectors could increase the threat to US and allied forces operating in the Gulf region. We want to request the Government of France to act immediately to terminate this activity by Sofradir and Ulis so China cannot use French components to manufacture weapons systems and sell them to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism.   ------------------------- ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES -------------------------  3. (S/NF) Post is requested to approach appropriate host government officials as soon as possible to pursue the following objectives and to deliver the talking points/non-paper in para 4 below:  -- Inform French officials we have information the French firm Sofradir and its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging systems.  -- Stress that Zhejiang Dali Technology is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities and that the use of high-grade French infrared detectors in this technology could increase the threat to US and allied forces operating in the Gulf region.  -- Ask the French government to investigate, share with us the results of its investigation, and act to have Sofradir and Ulis immediately terminate this activity.  -- Emphasize to French officials that infrared detectors are critical components of high performance thermal imaging systems and are controlled under the Wassenaar Arrangement, Section 6.A.2.a.3.  4. (SECRET/REL FRANCE) BEGIN TALKING POINTS  -- In the interest of transparency and enhanced cooperation on nonproliferation matters, we would like to share the following information:  -- We have information that the French firm Sofradir and its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell both cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging systems.  -- Our information indicates the Chinese firm is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities.  -- Iranian military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems that rely on high-grade French infrared detectors could increase the threat to US and allied forces operating in the Gulf region.  -- Infrared detectors (IRD) are sensors and critical components of high performance thermal imaging systems.  IRDs are controlled under Wassenaar Arrangement, Section 6.A.2.a.3.  -- IRDs are used in the core assemblies for advanced targeting pods, long-range reconnaissance systems, gimbaled imaging systems in manned and unmanned airborne reconnaissance and combat aircraft, Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensors, tank targeting systems, submarine periscopes, and missile seekers.  -- Diversion of the subject components could be harmful to our shared national security interests.  If these IRDs were included in the optical targeting mechanism for tanks and air defense systems, they could potentially be used to degrade US superiority in night combat operations.  -- We ask that you carefully consider the consequences of such sales.  -- We also welcome any further information about this case that may come to light in the course of any French investigation into the matter.

(U) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS:  U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY - EUROPEAN DECISION  - The White House announced that the President has approved Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff's unanimous recommendation for improved missile defenses in Europe against the threat from Iran to our forces and families deployed to the region and to our Allies.  - Iran already has hundreds of ballistic missiles that can threaten its neighbors in the Middle East, Turkey, and the Caucasus and it is actively developing and testing ballistic missiles that can reach more and more of Europe. -- Our concern regarding Iranian missile capabilities is further increased by the fact that our Intelligence Community continues to assess that Iran, at a minimum, is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons.  - The new "Phased, Adaptive Approach" recommended by Secretary Gates updates and revises the previous program for missile defense in Europe based on two key findings of the DoD review: -- First, the threat from Iran's regional ballistic missiles has developed more rapidly than previously expected.  At the same time, the threat from potential Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) has been slower to develop than we  STATE 00096550  002 OF 006   previously expected. -- Second, our missile defense capabilities and technologies have advanced significantly.  Improved interceptor capabilities, such as the currently deployed Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptor and advanced variants that are already in development, permit a more flexible and capable architecture.  - Therefore, the President has approved a Phased, Adaptive Approach that is responsive to the current threat, but also can incorporate new technologies quickly and cost-effectively to adapt as the threat and our technologies continue to change.  It will unfold in phases: -- The first phase will speed protection of U.S. deployed forces, civilians, and families and our Allies in Europe against the current threat from Iran by deploying proven systems by 2011 ) about six or seven years earlier than the previous program. -- Subsequent phases will add advanced variant sea- and land-based versions of the SM-3 and cover additional territory in Europe should the Iranian threat expand. -- In the fourth and final phase we will anticipate augmenting our existing capabilities to defend the United States against potential advances in Iran's ICBM capability with advanced versions of the SM-3.  This would be a similar capability to that provided in the program of record.  - This improved approach removes the need for a Ground Based Interceptor field in Poland and features a distributed interceptor and sensor architecture that does not require the single large, fixed radar originally planned to be located in the Czech Republic. -- Under the new approach, land- and sea-based missile defense interceptors and sensors offer some flexibility to be redeployed as the regional ballistic missile threat dictates.  This distributed network approach also will increase the survivability of the system and provide more opportunities for collaboration with Allies and partners. -- We are beginning consultations with Poland, the Czech Republic, and other Allies on the new approach, and will work with our NATO Allies on determining locations for the sensors and interceptors, and on integrating the Phased, Adaptive Approach with their missile defense capabilities and with the emerging NATO command and control network.  - Strong missile defenses will strengthen our efforts to find a solution that brings Iran into compliance with its international obligations: the more we can diminish the coercive value of Iran's missiles, the less Iran stands to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities.  - This set of recommendations comes from an ongoing Congressionally-mandated review that is taking a comprehensive examination of our global approach to missile defense and is consistent with the Defense Department's budget choices for fiscal year 2010: -- For example, we added additional funding to field more systems such as Aegis BMD ships and SM-3 interceptors.  END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS.  5. (S/REL NATO) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR USNATO AND EMBASSIES IN NATO CAPITALS (TALKING POINTS BELOW SHOULD BE USED FOR ALL NATO CAPITALS EXCEPT FOR POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC; WARSAW AND PRAGUE WILL RECEIVE SEPARATE TAILORED TALKING POINTS TO BE DELIVERED ON SEPTEMBER 17 BY THE FLOURNOY-TAUSCHER DELEGATION):  GENERAL  - NATO leaders have all agreed that ballistic missile proliferation poses an increasing threat to Allies' forces, territory, and populations.  - As a result, NATO has noted the significant contribution to Alliance security by those Allies who possess, or are  STATE 00096550  003 OF 006   acquiring, missile defense capabilities.  - At the 2008 Summit, NATO leaders agreed to consider options for a NATO missile defense system that would cover all remaining areas of Allied populations and territory.  To date, those efforts have focused on missile defense systems to protect deployed forces from shorter-range ballistic missile threats.  - At the 2009 NATO summit, Heads of State and Government tasked experts to examine the potential expansion of the ALTBMD program ) which is designed to be the command and control "backbone" for theater missile defense for deployed forces.  - The United States now proposes a "Phased Adaptive Approach," which will reinforce and strengthen on-going NATO efforts.  Specifically, we believe that the Phased Adaptive Approach is fully supportive of the decision to pursue options for a complementary NATO-wide multi-layered BMD architecture, which currently is envisioned to use NATO's command and control backbone architecture.  This is a flexible and cost-effective approach that leverages proven technologies against a known threat.  - Most importantly, the Phased Adaptive Approach is designed to work in concert with Allied efforts to provide protection against ballistic missile attack for all NATO Allies, reflecting the Alliance principle of indivisibility of security.  - The Phased Adaptive Approach will provide our most proven and operational missile defense capabilities in the near-term, defending Allied territory sooner against the current Iranian threat.  - U.S. missile defense efforts will of course be fully interoperable with those of NATO.  - We propose that -- subsequent to Alliance discussions and follow-on briefings in greater detail -- the Alliance examine how we can integrate the U.S. Phased Adaptive Approach with NATO missile defense.  This can be discussed further at the upcoming defense ministerial in Bratislava.  - The Phased Adaptive Approach would serve to greatly strengthen NATO's missile defense capabilities in the face of a growing threat to Alliance security.  - We look forward to engaging the Alliance in political and technical discussions in the weeks ahead.  FINANCING (if raised) - We will work closely with Allies to examine broader resourcing requirements for defense of Allied forces, territories and populations, including the integration of our Phased Adaptive Approach.  ROLE FOR NATO MEMBERS - We have already consulted with the two Allies that had agreed to host missile defense assets under the previous plan.  I want to reiterate that we are deeply appreciative of their readiness to take difficult political decisions to respond to the need to better protect allied territories and populations against the threat of ballistic missiles.  - We intend to engage in active consultations at NATO on the best way forward.  - The "Phased Adaptive Approach" is flexible and could be integrated into a NATO territorial missile defense system. There will be a requirement for Allies to host the sensors and interceptors to be included in the Phased Adaptive Approach.   There are many possibilities, and we look forward to continuing our NATO consultations.  - If pressed:  At this time, I would prefer not to get into  STATE 00096550  004 OF 006   specific issues related to potential Host Nations.    We have many options in this flexible architecture ) sea- and land-based, northern and southern Europe.  We intend to engage soon at NATO with Allies on those questions.  - We expect that Allied national systems or current NATO systems will be able to integrate well with the overall phased approach.  - Allied contributions can be interoperable with the Phased Approach missile defense architecture to ensure they form a cost-effective and comprehensive architecture.  GROUND BASED INTERCEPTORS - If needed:  The U.S. will continue to develop the GBI technology for CONUS defense because domestically it remains a cost-effective option. However, we have no plans to pursue GBIs in Europe given the promise and track record of SM-3 technology.  END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR NATO.  6. (C/REL RUSSIA)  BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR RUSSIA:  - The President's missile defense in Europe decision will publicly be announced at 10:00 a.m. Washington, D.C. time. The  National Security Advisor, General Jones, will be delivering a similar message to Ambassador Kislyak before the announcement.  - The decision is the result of a long review process; new information on the Iranian ballistic missile program drove the decision.  - Iran has made more progress on short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, and less progress on ICBMs than anticipated. Now the threat is greater to the Middle East and to Europe, with a less immediate threat to the United States.  - We do not plan to deploy GBIs in Poland and we will not base the European Mid-Course radar in the Czech Republic. Instead, there will be an adaptive, phased approach.  - We believe that Iran plans to deploy hundreds of these short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles.  Our old plan was designed to intercept only small numbers of ICBMs.  - There is no doubt that Iran is developing these missiles to arm them with a nuclear warhead.  There is NO OTHER REASON to spend so much time and effort into developing these missiles.  They are not useful weapons if only armed with a conventional warhead.  - The new plan for European missile defense is better designed to protect Europe from this Iranian threat that is emerging.  We intend to deploy the SM-3 interceptor which is what we are deploying in the Middle East as well.  SM-3s do not have the capability to threaten Russian ICBMs.  - In the first stages of deployment, we also are seeking to place these interceptors closer to Iran (from what I understand, this is exactly the idea that President Putin proposed to President Bush during their July 2007 meeting at Kennebunkport, Maine).  - The new plan calls for radars and detection systems to be deployed closer to Iran.  These radars will not have the capacity to track Russian ICBMs.  - With this decision behind us, we now want to move aggressively to launch serious cooperation on missile defense with Russia.  - As the President said during his meeting with President Medvedev in April, we want to begin by standing up the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC).  The hope is to share data from our respective early-warning systems.  STATE 00096550  005 OF 006   END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR RUSSIA.  7. (C/REL JAPAN) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR JAPAN:  - The U.S. greatly appreciates Japan's partnership in BMD; we remain deeply committed to strengthening regional BMD capabilities including operational cooperation, joint research, and co-development.  - Recent North Korean provocations serve as a reminder of the importance of our cooperative missile defense efforts, which help underpin a strong U.S.-Japan Alliance and contribute to regional stability.  - We remain committed to an effective defense of the U.S. and our Allies against rogue ballistic missile threats, including North Korea and, if it continues down its current path, Iran.   - As you are aware, the BMD Review has undertaken a comprehensive examination of our approach to missile defenses, including an in-depth look at our approach to European missile defense and in other regions around the world. -- USG discussions with the MOD and MOFA over the last several months made clear that you have particular interest in the European missile defense analysis -- we understand these strategic decisions have an impact in the Asia-Pacific region and want to make sure you are fully informed of our results. -- Throughout the review process the U.S. recognized and factored in Japanese concerns/equities especially those related to our on-going discussions with the Russian Federation.  - Although the BMD Review report is not due to Congress until this January, we have already reached some important conclusions.  We have decided to move forward with discussing results now so we do not delay deploying improved defenses for ourselves or our allies.  OTHER CONSULTATIONS  - We would like to explain the President's decision to you before our public announcement and before we speak with Russia.  We are discussing this new European approach with Poland, the Czech Republic, and NATO, as we speak. -- As a close and trusted ally, we consider it important to share this information with you.  However, in light of past problems with information security, we must insist that you take every precaution to ensure that this information will not be leaked.  Any leaks would have significant implications for our European missile defense approach, and would be damaging to our bilateral relationship.  Should there be a security breach elsewhere, it is important that our governments not officially confirm leaked information if it appears in the media before official release by the U.S. Government.  THE PHASED ADAPTIVE APPROACH  - As you have seen, the new plan for European missile defense will use the SM-3 interceptor, both land- and sea-based, rather than GBIs included in the previous program.  - In many ways, your leadership and partnership in the development of the SM-3 and in operational coordination have been critical to our development of this new approach to Europe.  Just as we have cooperatively deployed proven and transportable missile defenses to help defend against ballistic missile threats in the Asia-Pacific region, we will deploy those same technologies and capabilities in Europe.  - At this time, the new European approach is based on U.S.-owned SM-3s.  However, we will want to look at future missile defense opportunities with NATO and our European  STATE 00096550  006 OF 006   allies that could include potential sales of a number of missile defense capabilities.  We would very much like to work with Japan to make strategic decisions about whether and how our jointly developed missile (i.e., the SM-3 Block IIA) could be part of that future, and perhaps part of a future networked global system of regional missile defense architectures.  - We look forward to continuing our strong partnership on missile defense and growing our cooperative activities.  BMD FOR JAPAN AND EAST ASIA  - As mentioned previously, the phased approach in Europe is in many ways similar to the approach we have taken with you. We believe that our current approach in the Asia- Pacific region is sound and forms a model that we can draw upon elsewhere.  Naturally, we will re-engage with you soon on the full findings of our BMD Review.  IF ASKED ABOUT BURDEN SHARING AT NATO:  - As you well know, this type of approach creates opportunities for participation ) for example, in command and control, sensors, and interceptors ) and enhanced cooperation, similar to the type that we already enjoy.  We look forward to engaging with NATO soon about how our new approach contributes to common defenses and how we can share responsibilities in that effort.  END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR JAPAN.  8.

C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000645  SIPDIS  WHA FOR A/S TOM SHANNON L FOR HAROLD KOH AND JOAN DONOGHUE NSC FOR DAN RESTREPO  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2019 TAGS: PGOV KDEM KJUS TFH01 HOSUBJECT: TFHO1: OPEN AND SHUT: THE CASE OF THE HONDURAN COUP  REF: TEGUCIGALPA 578  Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b and d)  1. (C) Summary:  Post has attempted to clarify some of the legal and constitutional issues surrounding the June 28 forced removal of President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya.  The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.  There is equally no doubt from our perspective that Roberto Micheletti's assumption of power was illegitimate.  Nevertheless, it is also evident that the constitution itself may be deficient in terms of providing clear procedures for dealing with alleged illegal acts by the President and resolving conflicts between the branches of government.  End summary.  2. (U) Since the June 28 removal and expulsion of President Zelaya by the Honduran armed forces, the Embassy has consulted Honduran legal experts (one cannot find a fully unbiased professional legal opinion in Honduras in the current politically charged atmosphere) and reviewed the text of the Honduran Constitution and its laws to develop a better understanding of the arguments being parlayed by the coup's supporters and opponents.  ------------------------------- Arguments of the Coup Defenders -------------------------------  3. (SBU) Defenders of the June 28 coup have offered some combination of the following, often ambiguous, arguments to assert it's legality:  -- Zelaya had broken the law (alleged but not proven);  -- Zelaya resigned (a clear fabrication);  -- Zelaya intended to extend his term in office (supposition);  -- Had he been allowed to proceed with his June 28 constitutional reform opinion poll, Zelaya would have dissolved Congress the following day and convened a constituent assembly (supposition);  -- Zelaya had to be removed from the country to prevent a bloodbath;  -- Congress "unanimously" (or in some versions by a 123-5 vote) deposed Zelaya; (after the fact and under the cloak of secrecy); and  -- Zelaya "automatically" ceased to be president the moment he suggested modifying the constitutional prohibition on presidential reelection.  4. (C) In our view, none of the above arguments has any substantive validity under the Honduran constitution.  Some are outright false.  Others are mere supposition or ex-post rationalizations of a patently illegal act.  Essentially:  -- the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the country;  -- Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president;  -- Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process;  -- the purported "resignation" letter was a fabrication and was not even the basis for Congress's action of June 28; and  -- Zelaya's arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.  ------------------------------------------- Impeachment under the Honduran Constitution -------------------------------------------  5. (U) Under the Honduran Constitution as currently written, the President may be removed only on the basis of death, resignation or incapacitation.  Only the Supreme Court may determine that a President has been "incapacitated" on the basis of committing a crime.  6. (U) There is no explicit impeachment procedure in the 1982 Honduran Constitution.  Originally, Article 205-15 stated that Congress had the competence to determine whether "cause" existed against the President, but it did not stipulate on what grounds or under what procedure. Article 319-2 stated that the Supreme Court would "hear" cases of official or common crimes committed by high-level officials, upon a finding of cause by the Congress.  This implied a vague two-step executive impeachment process involving the other two branches of government, although without specific criteria or procedures.  However, Article 205 was abrogated in 2003, and the corresponding provision of Article 319 (renumbered 313) was revised to state only that the Supreme Court would hear "processes initiated" against high officials.  Thus, it appears that under the Constitution as currently written, removal of a president or a government official is an entirely judicial matter.  7. (U) Respected legal opinion confirms that the removal of a president is a judicial matter. According to a 2006 book by respected legal scholar Enrique Flores Valeriano -- late father of Zelaya's Minister of the Presidency, Enrique Flores Lanza -- Article 112 of the Law of Constitutional Justice indicates that if any government official is found to be in violation of the Constitution, that person should be removed from office immediately with the ultimate authority on matters of Constitutionality being the Supreme Court.  8. (U) Many legal experts have also confirmed to us that the Honduran process for impeaching a President or other senior-level officials is a judicial procedure.  They assert that under Honduran law the process consists of formal criminal charges being filed by the Attorney General against the accused with the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court could accept or reject the charges.  If the Court moved to indict, it would assign a Supreme Court magistrate, or a panel of magistrates to investigate the matter, and oversee the trial.  The trial process is open and transparent and the defendant would be given a full right of self-defense.  If convicted in the impeachment trial, the magistrates have authority to remove the President or senior official.  Once the President is removed, then the constitutional succession would follow.  In this case, if a President is legally charged, convicted, and removed, his successor is the Vice President or what is termed the Presidential Designate.  In the current situation in Honduras, since the Vice President, Elvin Santos, resigned last December in order to be able to run as the Liberal Party Presidential candidate, President Zelaya's successor would be Congress President Roberto Micheletti. Unfortunately, the President was never tried, or convicted, or was legally removed from office to allow a legal succession.  ----------------------------- The Legal Case Against Zelaya -----------------------------  9. (C) Zelaya's opponents allege that he violated the Constitution on numerous grounds, some of which appear on their face to be valid, others not:  -- Refusing to submit a budget to the Congress: The Constitution is unambiguous that the Executive shall submit a proposed budget to Congress by September 15 each year (Art. 367), that Congress shall approve the budget (Art. 366) and that no obligations or payments may be effectuated except on the basis of an approved budget (Art. 364);  -- Refusing to fund the Congress: Article 212 states that the Treasury shall apportion quarterly the funds needed for the operation of the Congress;  -- Proposing an illegal constitutional referendum: The Constitution may be amended only through two-thirds vote of the Congress in two consecutive sessions (Art. 373 and 375); a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution, as Zelaya promoted, is therefore unconstitutional; however, it is not clear that proposing a constituent assembly in itself violates the constitution, only that any changes ensuing from that assembly would be invalid;  -- Defying the judgment of a competent court: Zelaya insisted on pushing ahead with his constitutional reform opinion poll after both a first-instance court and an appeals court ordered him to suspend those efforts; however, while he clearly intended to follow through with the poll, he never actually did it;  -- Proposing to reform unreformable articles: Since Zelaya's proposed constituent assembly would have unlimited powers to rewrite the constitution, it violated Article 374, which makes certain articles unamendable; once again, though, Zelaya never actually attempted to change the so-called "carved in stone" articles; it was only assumed he intended to;  -- Dismissing the armed forces chief: The Supreme Court's Constitutional Hall ruled June 25 that Zelaya was in violation of the Constitution for dismissing Defense Chief Vasquez Velasquez; the Constitution (Art. 280) states that the President may freely name or remove the chief of the armed forces; but the court ruled that since Zelaya fired him for refusing to carry out a poll the court had ruled illegal, the firing was illegal.  10. (C) Although a case could well have been made against Zelaya for a number of the above alleged constitutional violations, there was never any formal, public weighing of the evidence nor any semblance of due process.  ----------------------- The Article 239 Cannard -----------------------  11. (U) Article 239, which coup supporters began citing after the fact to justify Zelaya's removal (it is nowhere mentioned in the voluminous judicial dossier against Zelaya), states that any official proposing to reform the constitutional prohibition against reelection of the president shall immediately cease to carry out their functions and be ineligible to hold public office for 10 years.  Coup defenders have asserted that Zelaya therefore automatically ceased to be President when he proposed a constituent assembly to rewrite the Constitution.  12. (C) Post's analysis indicates the Article 239 argument is flawed on multiple grounds:  -- Although it was widely assumed that Zelaya's reason for seeking to convoke a constituent assembly was to amend the constitution to allow for reelection, we are not aware that he ever actually stated so publicly;  -- Article 239 does not stipulate who determines whether it has been violated or how, but it is reasonable to assume that it does not abrogate other guarantees of due process and the presumption of innocence;  -- Article 94 states that no penalty shall be imposed without the accused having been heard and found guilty in a competent court;  -- Many other Honduran officials, including presidents, going back to the first elected government under the 1982 Constitution, have proposed allowing presidential reelection, and they were never deemed to have been automatically removed from their positions as a result.  13. (C) It further warrants mention that Micheletti himself should be forced to resign following the logic of the 239 argument, since as President of Congress he considered legislation to have a fourth ballot box ("cuarta urna") at the November elections to seek voter approval for a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.  Any member of Congress who discussed the proposal should also be required to resign, and National Party presidential candidate Pepe Lobo, who endorsed the idea, should be ineligible to hold public office for 10 years.  --------------------------------------------- - Forced Removal by Military was Clearly Illegal --------------------------------------------- -  14.  (C) Regardless of the merits of Zelaya's alleged constitutional violations, it is clear from even a cursory reading that his removal by military means was illegal, and even the most zealous of coup defenders have been unable to make convincing arguments to bridge the intellectual gulf between "Zelaya broke the law" to "therefore, he was packed off to Costa Rica by the military without a trial."  -- Although coup supporters allege the court issued an arrest warrant for Zelaya for disobeying its order to desist from the opinion poll, the warrant, made public days later, was for him to be arrested and brought before the competent authority, not removed from the county;  -- Even if the court had ordered Zelaya to be removed from the country, that order would have been unconstitutional; Article 81 states that all Hondurans have the right to remain in the national territory, subject to certain narrow exceptions spelled out in Article 187, which may be invoked only by the President of the Republic with the agreement of the Council of Ministers; Article 102 states that no Honduran may be expatriated;  -- The armed forces have no/no competency to execute judicial orders; originally, Article 272 said the armed forces had the responsibility to "maintain peace, public order and the 'dominion' of the constitution," but that language was excised in 1998; under the current text, only the police are authorized to uphold the law and execute court orders (Art. 293);  -- Accounts of Zelaya's abduction by the military indicate he was never legally "served" with a warrant; the soldiers forced their way in by shooting out the locks and essentially kidnapped the President.  15. (U) The Armed Forces' ranking legal advisor, Col. Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, acknowledged in an interview published in the Honduran press July 5 that the Honduran Armed Forces had broken the law in removing Zelaya from the country.  That same day it was reported that the Public Ministry was investigating the actions of the Armed Forces in arresting and deporting Zelaya June 28 and that the Supreme Court had asked the Armed Forces to explain the circumstances that motivated his forcible exile.  16. (C) As reported reftel, the legal adviser to the Supreme Court told Poloff that at least some justices on the Court consider Zelaya's arrest and deportation by the military to have been illegal.  ------------------------------------------ Congress Had no Authority to Remove Zelaya ------------------------------------------  17. (C) As explained above, the Constitution as amended in 2003 apparently gives sole authority for removing a president to the judiciary.  The Congressional action of June 28 has been reported in some media as acceptance of Zelaya's resignation, based on a bogus resignation letter dated June 25 that surfaced after the coup.  However, the June 28 Congressional resolution makes no mention of the letter, nor does it state that Congress was accepting Zelaya's resignation.  It says Congress "disapproves" of Zelaya's conduct and therefore "separates" him from the office of President -- a constitutional authority Congress does not have.  Furthermore, a source in the Congressional leadership told us that a quorum was not present when the resolution was adopted, rendering it invalid.  There was no recorded vote, nor a request for the "yeas" and "nays."  18. (C) In sum, for a constitutional succession from Zelaya to Micheletti to occur would require one of several conditions:  Zelaya's resignation, his death, or permanent medical incapacitation (as determined by judicial and medical authorities), or as discussed previously, his formal criminal conviction and removal from office.  In the absence of any of these conditions and since Congress lacked the legal authority to remove Zelaya, the actions of June 28 can only be considered a coup d'etat by the legislative branch, with the support of the judicial branch and the military, against the executive branch.  It bears mentioning that, whereas the resolution adopted June 28 refers only to Zelaya, its effect was to remove the entire executive branch.  Both of these actions clearly exceeded Congress's authority.  ------- Comment -------  19. (C) The analysis of the Constitution sheds some interesting light on the events of June 28.  The Honduran establishment confronted a dilemma: near unanimity among the institutions of the state and the political class that Zelaya had abused his powers in violation of the Constitution, but with some ambiguity what to do about it. Faced with that lack of clarity, the military and/or whoever ordered the coup fell back on what they knew -- the way Honduran presidents were removed in the past: a bogus resignation letter and a one-way ticket to a neighboring country.  No matter what the merits of the case against Zelaya, his forced removal by the military was clearly illegal, and Micheletti's ascendance as "interim president" was totally illegitimate.  20. (C) Nonetheless, the very Constitutional uncertainty that presented the political class with this dilemma may provide the seeds for a solution.  The coup's most ardent legal defenders have been unable to make the intellectual leap from their arguments regarding Zelaya's alleged crimes to how those allegations justified dragging him out of his bed in the night and flying him to Costa Rica.  That the Attorney General's office and the Supreme Court now reportedly question the legality of that final step is encouraging and may provide a face-saving "out" for the two opposing sides in the current standoff.

S E C R E T TEL AVIV 001060  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2019 TAGS: PREL MPOS KNNP IR ISSUBJECT: REP. WEXLER DISCUSSES IRAN WITH IDF INTELLIGENCE CHIEF YADLIN  Classified By: DCM Luis G, Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (S)  Representative Robert Wexler (D, Florida), accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Rogin and DCM Moreno, met with Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Chief, MG Amos Yadlin, on Sunday 10 May 2009.  MG Yadlin focused his discussion on the preparations for the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu to the United States and the Iranian nuclear program.  MG Yadlin informed Rep. Wexler that the PM was preparing intensely for his upcoming visit to Washington.  In addition to hours of policy review, the PM had been provided significant amounts of intelligence from the IDI and Mossad on Iran's nuclear program.  The intelligence presented included assessments of the current status of the Iranian program; timelines, effects of sanctions; views of the international community; and outcomes of engagement.  The differences that exist between the intelligence community in interpretations of the Iranian nuclear program as well as the relationship between Iran and the Palestinians were also presented.  MG Yadlin indicated that the IDF had presented its information last week, leaving the cabinet on Friday 08 May 2009 to consider policy options and how information will be presented during the upcoming visit to Washington. Although no direct feedback was provided, MG Yadlin opined that the PM appears determined on Iran.  2.  (S)  Rep. Wexler asked MG Yadlin to expand on the differences in the interpretations of the intelligence.  MG Yadlin explained that until 2003, Iran had violated the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty by having a weaponization group and although Iran could show civilian uses for a missile program and a fissile program, there was no justification for a weaponization group.  He went on to say that Iran halted its program in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq, but reinvigorated the program in 2005.  He expressed that some in the US agree with this and others do not.  He went on to explain that Israel is not in a position to underestimate Iran and be surprised like the US was on 11 September 2001.  3.  (S)  MG Yadlin explained that Israel tries to be more precise than the US in estimating Iran's intentions and timeline for obtaining a nuclear bomb.  Iran is in the position of wanting to pay only a minimum cost for its current program. It does not want to be North Korea or what Iraq was before 2003.  Iran intends to keep resolutions and sanctions at a certain manageable level and continue to produce low enriched uranium until there is enough for several bombs.  MG Yadlin stated that Iran could decide to produce a bomb by 2010, but Iran is waiting for the right time in the future and that there are some who will always doubt it despite the evidence.  4.  (S)  Rep. Wexler then asked about the prospect of engagement.  MG Yadlin said he does not oppose engagement, and in fact gave a speech approximately six months ago expressing that Israel needed to find a way to find positives in engagement.   He feels there needs to be an agreed upon deadline; a measure for success or failure; and a plan B if engagement does not work in order for engagement to have any chance.  He also expressed strongly that engagement should have already started.  MG Yadlin outlined four possible outcomes of engagement.  Two good outcomes would be the Iranian nuclear program stopped or a failure of engagement that allows Russia and China to see the US made all efforts to prevent the program diplomatically and allows for greater cooperation in the future.  Two bad outcomes would be Iran playing for time with no claim of failure on the part of engagement or a bad bargain that still allows Iran to obtain a nuclear bomb even if in a longer timeline.  Rep. Wexler went on to discuss that there is a third good option in that the President may have better leverage with the American public to support action if engagement efforts are attempted and failed.  Rep Wexler recommended that the Israeli people need to consider the US perspective and public opinion.  MG Yadlin responded that he is not recommending the US enter a third front, but it has to be understood that Israel sees things differently and that Israel has to be ready and can not remove the military option from the table.  Rep Wexler stated that he expected Israel would be pleasantly surprised by the President's acceptance of all possible options in regards to Iran.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 001177  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2019 TAGS: PREL PTER PGOV MOPS IR KWBG ISSUBJECT: CODELS CASEY AND ACKERMAN MEET WITH DEFENSE MINISTER BARAK  Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b,d)  1. (C) Summary:  Post hosted two CODELS during the week of May 25: one from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led by Senator Casey, the other from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs led by Congressman Ackerman.  Both delegations met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who conveyed similar points on the Peace Process and Israel's concerns about Iran.  End summary.  Peace Process -------------  2. (C) Barak began his meeting with the Casey delegation by apologizing for being late due to what he described as an "internal debate" at the Prime Minister's office regarding the development of a response to President Obama's upcoming speech in Cairo.  He noted there are "perceived gaps" between the USG and the GOI regarding the Peace Process, and explained the GOI's internal debate is focused primarily on how to ensure that the U.S. and Israel "trust each other." Barak expressed confidence that PM Netanyahu is sincere in wanting to "seize this opportunity and move forward" with the Palestinians, but alluded to members of the coalition who do not agree with this course of action.  3. (C) From his perspective, Barak told the Casey delegation that the GOI was in no position to dictate policy to the Palestinians or the USG regarding the Peace Process -- "it takes two to tango, and three to negotiate," he said.  Barak noted that it is the GOI's responsibility to ensure that "no stone is left unturned" regarding the Peace Process; if efforts to achieve peace ultimately fail, then the GOI must be able to state that every effort was pursued.  He said he personally had no objection to "two states for two nations," and panned Arab arguments for a bi-national state in Israel. Barak said Israel envisions "two peoples living side by side in peace and good neighborliness" as the final goal.  4. (C) With the Ackerman delegation, Barak focused on the need for a regional approach to the peace process.  He supports a regional initiative for peace and cooperation for the entire Middle East region to be launched by Israel.  He stressed as well the need to build trust and convince the U.S. administration that the new Israeli government is "serious in its efforts toward peace."  5. (C) Barak commented on political developments in the West Bank and Gaza in both meetings.  He said the GOI continues to review its policy, and then added that the Palestinian Authority has much to accomplish in terms of law enforcement, a functioning judiciary, and regaining control of Gaza before a "balanced" Palestinian state can be created.  He has been extremely impressed with the work of U.S. Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton training PA security forces, and commended Salam Fayyad's concrete, practical approach.  6. (C) Barak made clear in these meetings that he feels the Palestinian Authority is weak and lacks self-confidence, and that Gen. Dayton's training helps bolster confidence.  He explained that the GOI had consulted with Egypt and Fatah prior to Operation Cast Lead, asking if they were willing to assume control of Gaza once Israel defeated Hamas.  Not surprisingly, Barak said, the GOI received negative answers from both.  He stressed the importance of continued consultations with both Egypt and Fatah -- as well as the NGO community -- regarding Gaza reconstruction, and to avoid publicly linking any resolution in Gaza to the release of kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.  Iran/North Korea ----------------  7. (C) In his meeting with CODEL Casey, Barak said the GOI believes its "keystone" relations with the USG remain strong.  He described the integral role the USG plays in preserving Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME), especially when faced with threats posed by Iran, Hizballah, and Hamas.  He noted that the GOI's positions on Iran are well known, and described North Korea's recent nuclear test as a "second wake-up call" (the first being the AQ Khan network).  Barak asked rhetorically how a lack of firm response to North Korea would be interpreted by Iran's leadership, speculating the USG would be viewed as a "paper tiger."  8. (C) In both meetings, Barak said "no option should be removed from the table" when confronting Iran and North Korea; engagement will only work in conjunction with a credible military option, he said.  Barak said he was  TEL AVIV 00001177  002 OF 002   personally skeptical that engagement would lead to an acceptable resolution, and argued in favor of a paradigm shift to confront the triple threat posed by nuclear proliferation, Islamic extremist terrorism, and rogue/failing states.  He said a strategic partnership with China, Russia, India, and the EU is essential in facing these threats. Barak argued that failure to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran would result in a nuclear arms race in the region as Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia look to acquire nuclear weapons.  9. (C) When asked if the USG and GOI have fundamental differences of opinion when assessing Iran's nuclear program, Barak said we share the same intelligence, but acknowledged differences in analysis.  He suggested that the USG view is similar to presenting evidence in a criminal court case in which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. As such, USG standards are tougher -- especially following the failure to find WMD in Iraq -- while end-products such as the 2007 NIE unintentionally take on a softer tone as a result.  Barak said the fate of the region and the world rests on our ability to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons -- as such, the standards for determining guilt should be lower as the costs are higher.  10. (C) In both meetings, Barak described Iranians as "chess, not backgammon players."  As such, Iran will attempt to avoid any hook to hang accusations on, and look to Pakistan and North Korea as models to emulate in terms of acquiring nuclear weapons while defying the international community. He doubted Tehran would opt for an open, relatively low-threshold test like the recent one in North Korea. Rather, Iran will seek ways to bypass the NPT while ensuring its program is redundant and well-protected to prevent an irreparable military strike.  Barak estimated a window between 6 and 18 months from now in which stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable.  After that, he said, any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage.  He also expressed concern that should Iran develop nuclear capabilities, other rogue states and/or terrorist groups would not be far behind.  Pakistan --------  11. (C) Barak reinforced his message regarding Pakistan in both meetings.  He described Pakistan as his "private nightmare," suggesting the world might wake up one morning "with everything changed" following a potential Islamic extremist takeover.  When asked if the use of force on Iran might backfire with moderate Muslims in Pakistan, thereby exacerbating the situation, Barak acknowledged Iran and Pakistan are interconnected, but disagreed with a causal chain. To the contrary, he argued that if the United States had directly confronted North Korea in recent years, others would be less inclined to pursue nuclear weapons programs. By avoiding confrontation with Iran, Barak argued, the U.S. faces a perception of weakness in the region.  12.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 001184  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV KNNP IR KWBG EG ISSUBJECT: CODELS ACKERMAN AND CASEY MEETINGS WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU  Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b),( d)  1.  (S) Summary.  CODEL Ackerman and Casey met separately May 26 and 27 with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.  The Prime Minister discussed his visit to Washington, focusing on his discussions of Iran, a regional approach in support of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and his approach to the Palestinians and settlements, including his opposition to a complete freeze on settlement construction.  Netanyahu said he was pleased with President Obama's approach to engagement with Iran and on a regional component to peacemaking.  On the Palestinians, he reiterated his view that the Palestinian Authority (PA) must declare its recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and also reviewed his thinking on the importance of security for Israelis and his support for increased Arab private investment in the West Bank.  On settlements, Netanyahu said he would take action against illegal outposts and would not build new settlements or confiscate more Palestinian land, but he insisted that he would not support a complete freeze on construction, and noted that his advisers would try to close the gap with the U.S. on this issue.  Members of the CODELs pressed Netanyahu on the importance of finding ways to strengthen PA President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, as well as to address humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Gaza.  End summary.  Washington Visit ----------------  2.  (S) Prime Minister Netanyahu told CODEL Ackerman that he did not feel boxed in politically and that his coalition in fact reflects the demands of the Israeli public to address their concern about security.  While some argue that agreements bring security, Netanyahu said Israel's experience of the past fifteen years proved that neither agreements nor unilateral withdrawals brought security.  Netanyahu said he had told President Obama that while he would not condition negotiations with the Palestinians on halting Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon, if Iran obtained such a weapon it would destroy any progress made toward peace.  He added that Egyptian President Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah were in complete agreement with him on that point.  3.  (S) For the sake of both security and peace, the first task is to stop Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu noted that the President had assured him that by the end of the year, the U.S. will decide whether engagement is working and that the goal is to stop Iran's program.  The President told him that all options remain on the table, a point confirmed by Secretaries Clinton and Gates.  Netanyahu said he and Mubarak agreed that a nuclear Iran would lead others in the region to develop nuclear weapons, resulting in the biggest threat to non-proliferation efforts since the Cuban Missile Crisis. This "nightmare scenario" is well understood in Washington, he said.  4.  (C) Turning to peace efforts, Netanyahu said the President is bringing a fresh approach to regional peace whereby the Arabs would enhance the Israeli-Palestinian track.  It will be especially important to get the Saudis on board, he added.  On the two-state solution, Netanyahu noted that the President had stressed his support for two states. He had told the President that Israelis did not want to rule Palestinians.  Netanyahu said he was prepared for "arrangements" with the Palestinians that would entail some limits on their sovereignty such as no Palestinian army, and Israeli control over borders, airspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  Netanyahu asserted that seventy to eighty percent of Israelis are ready to make concessions for peace but they do not believe they have a Palestinian partner since Hamas is in control of Gaza and Iran has a base on Israel's border.  How can there be peace without a new situation in Gaza, he asked.  5.  (C) Turning to settlements, Netanyahu noted that he had told the President that both Israel and the Palestinians had unfulfilled Roadmap commitments.  Without elaborating, he noted that there were written and oral understandings between President Bush and Prime Ministers Sharon and Olmert on the Roadmap.  In Gaza, Israel dismantled twenty-seven settlements but got six thousand rockets from Hamas in return.  Support the PA --------------  6.  (C) Chairman Ackerman commented that President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are necessary for progress, and noted that both Israel and the U.S. will be in trouble if they are replaced.  Something needs to be done to help them stay in power.  They need material support but also the promise of  TEL AVIV 00001184  002 OF 003   statehood.  Foreign investment in the West Bank would give a real horizon as well.  Netanyahu agreed, saying Gulf Arab investors had been successful in transforming their own societies and could make a great contribution to the Palestinians.  He added that he wanted to bring Gulf investors into the West Bank since they would change reality for the Palestinians but also give Israelis confidence. Ackerman responded that this was a great idea, but it should come from Abbas, not Israel.  The more credit Abbas can take for steps forward, the better.  7.  (C) In response to a question about the PA security forces' capabilities, Netanyahu commented that he supports the PA's desire to keep Hamas at a distance.  A national unity government without Hamas' acceptance of the Quartet conditions would serve Hamas' interests, adding that Israel has a common interest with the PA to prevent a Hamas takeover of the West Bank.  Netanyahu said there is a steady flow of Iranian weapons to Gaza through Sudan or Syria and then by sea, but he said Egypt's performance in stopping the tunnels has improved now that Cairo understands that the Iranian arms pipeline is a direct threat to Egypt as well.  8.  (C) On the economic side, Netanyahu said he wants to establish a joint plan with the PA to improve conditions in the West Bank.  He cited Cyprus as an example of economic prosperity leading to reduced political tensions.  Sen. Lautenberg pushed Netanyahu to  Israel,s best face forward8 in the West Bank, and to work with the PA on water issues, conservation and health, where Israel could contribute a great deal and there are many opportunities to build cooperation that would benefit people.  Netanyahu responded that his ministerial committee on improving the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank met earlier in the day and that he is committed to overcoming the turf wars and excessive caution that have undercut development efforts in the West Bank in the past.  He said the GOI is looking at creative ideas, such as how to facilitate tourism to Jericho, advance projects in water and agriculture, in addition to promoting business (note: he estimated that there are 100 projects Israel is examining in the West Bank).   is beyond belief8 what can be done in the West Bank, he said, but he hoped the PA would engage with Israel on these efforts.  Netanyahu added that the fact that there had not been any large anti-Israel demonstrations in the West Bank during Operation Cast Lead meant that Palestinians in the West Bank want a better life, not confrontation with Israel.  9.  (C) Representative Ellison, noting that he is the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, said he visited Gaza in February and met with NGO representatives who could deliver assistance without the credit going to Hamas.  He urged Netanyahu to consider opening the Gaza crossings, adding that Gazans he had met told him they want peace and would like to get their jobs back in Israel.  Netanyahu responded that he is looking at ways to balance Israeli security with enabling Gazans to have a normal life.  The flow of money and weapons to Hamas remains a problem since Hamas is extending the range and payload of the rockets it possesses.  In response to Representative Ellison's comment that Israel should allow USAID to return to Gaza, Netanyahu said he thought that it might be a good thing to have USAID operate in Gaza.  Settlements and Outposts ------------------------  10.  (C) Netanyahu said that illegal outposts were a legal question and his government would enforce the law.  The outposts should be removed through dialogue with the GOI if possible, but it should be done in any case.  Regarding settlements, Netanyahu said he wants to work with the U.S. on the basis of the understandings reached with the Bush Administration, i.e. that Israel will not build new settlements or seize more land, but if families grow, they will still have the right to build within existing settlement boundaries.  Now Israel is hearing that the U.S. wants no construction at all.  Israelis consider this position to be unfair, he said.  The question is whether the U.S. is seeking a geographic or a demographic restriction on settlements.  11.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Israel needs a common understanding with the U.S.  The U.S. position should be "reasonable," since opposition to a total freeze cuts across political parties in Israel.  This is more of an issue with the U.S. than with the Palestinians, Netanyahu asserted, arguing that the PA will go along if there is an understanding between Israel and the U.S.  He noted that Israeli officials were meeting with U.S. officials on this issue, adding that there could be an understanding if the U.S. wants one.  Netanyahu commented that he understood there should be no land seizures, but he could not tell settlers  TEL AVIV 00001184  003 OF 003   not to have children.  In response to a question about GOI incentives to settlers, Netanyahu's adviser Ron Dermer said the Olmert government had already removed them.  Netanyahu said this was an issue that Israel could discuss further with the U.S.  Iranian Threat --------------  12.  (S) Chairman Ackerman said that in his meetings with Arab leaders, he found them all concerned about Iran.  They said it would helpful to resolve the Palestinian issue, but Israel-Palestine is not the main threat to the region. Netanyahu, following a similar comment during his meeting with CODEL Casey, responded that there are no Arab leaders who would tell the U.S. to wait on Iran until there is a settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Ackerman also explained that the U.S. will try engagement in order to prevent an unwise and premature use of force.  We will tighten sanctions at the same time, for which we need the support of the international community, Ackerman explained. Netanyahu noted that Ahmadinejad had said he would not stop Iran's nuclear program.  President Obama had been clear in his comments to Netanyahu that U.S. engagement would be results-oriented and not open-ended.  If engagement did not work, the U.S. would gain the moral high ground, which would help make economic pressure more effective.  Ackerman agreed that more pressure was needed and said we need to figure out what the Russians and others want.  Netanyahu said that in contrast to North Korea, the Iranian nuclear and missile programs were direct threats to Israel, Europe and U.S. interests in the Gulf, and he emphasized that the program was not defensive in nature.  In response to a question from Representative Jackson-Lee, Netanyahu encouraged quick action on a bill in the Congress to pressure foreign oil companies not to sell refined petroleum to Iran.  This might not be enough to stop Iran's program but it would send a strong signal.  Netanyahu also urged that the U.S. demand that Iran stop all uranium enrichment since enrichment is the main element of their program.  He commented that Iran might try to use the talks with the U.S. to continue or accelerate their enrichment process.  Netanyahu cautioned that he was skeptical of the idea that the Iranian leadership could change.  They have a dangerous worldview, a violent theocracy, but it may be possible to move them if they find the U.S. strong and determined.  Iran, he commented, is bent on becoming a global and not just a regional power.  13.

S E C R E T TEL AVIV 001688  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MOPS PTER EG CH IR SA LE ISSUBJECT: PM A/S SHAPIRO'S JULY 22-23 VISIT TO ISRAEL  REF: GRUBB-MILLER 07/22/09 E-MAIL  Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)  1. (S) Summary:  Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro met with a number of GOI officials on July 22-23 to stress the importance of the U.S.-Israeli political-military relationship, and to discuss among other issues Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  GOI interlocutors continued to press for the opportunity to review the QME report prior to its submission to Congress, and presented an official response to a U.S. non-paper on potential arms transfers to Arab countries.  In that respect, the MOD proposed technical discussions in Washington on August 3 to further discuss GOI concerns over the potential F-15SA transfer to Saudi Arabia.  GOI officials continued to express reservations regarding U.S. arms transfers to Lebanon, and requested the opportunity to further discuss U.S. strategy and intentions with respect to the Lebanese Armed Forces.  GOI interlocutors raised continued concerns over the Iranian nuclear weapons program, noting that any policy of engagement be done in conjunction with tougher sanctions and for a finite period of time before turning to other "options on the table."  Other issues raised by GOI officials included the Peace Process, Israel's export control system, and potential Israeli exports to China.  Both sides agreed in principle to the next session of the Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) in October or early November in Israel. End summary.  2. (SBU)  On July 22, A/S Shapiro met with MOD Director General Pinchas Buchris, MOD Political-Military Director Amos Gilad, Defense Export Control Directorate Chief Eli Pincu, and participated in a roundtable discussion led by J5 Strategic Division Chief Brigadier General Yossi Heymann.  At the MFA on July 23, A/S Shapiro met with Director General Yossi Gal and participated in a roundtable discussion led by Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar and Export Control Director Roey Gilad.  A/S Shapiro also participated in a strategic tour of Israel, and visited Israeli defense company Plasan-Sasa.  U.S.-Israeli Relationship -------------------------  3. (SBU) A/S Shapiro stressed the importance of the U.S-Israeli political-military relationship, noting the significance of visiting Israel on his first overseas trip in his capacity as Assistant Secretary for the Political-Military Affairs Bureau.  GOI interlocutors appreciated the opportunity to resume dialogue on this important aspect of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.  MOD DG Buchris noted the two still relatively new administrations in the United States and Israel, and the importance of limiting the number of misunderstandings in the future.  Qualitative Military Edge -------------------------  4. (S) GOI officials reiterated the importance of maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  They said that Israel understands U.S. policy intentions to arm moderate Arab states in the region to counter the Iranian threat, and prefers such sales originate from the United States instead of other countries like Russia or China.  However, Israel continues to stress the importance of identifying potential risks that may become future threats or adversaries, and for this reason maintains several objections as indicated in the official GOI response to the QME non-paper on potential U.S. arms sales to the region (ref e-mail to PM/RSAT separately).  5. (S) GOI officials also expressed continued interest in reviewing the QME report prior to its submission to Congress.  A/S Shapiro reiterated that the report was based on an assessment from the intelligence community, and therefore not releasable to the GOI.  He referenced previous points made to the Israeli embassy in Washington regarding the report, and welcomed any comments the GOI might have -- although such comments should be delivered as soon as possible as the report is already overdue.  Israeli interlocutors appreciated the classified nature of the report, but also made clear it was difficult to comment on the report's results without reviewing its content or intelligence assessment.  In that respect, Buchris and other GOI officials requested that the QME process be reviewed in light of future QME reports.  6. (S) GOI interlocutors attempted to make the argument that moderate Arab countries could in the future become adversaries -- and that this should be taken into account in the QME process.  During a roundtable discussion led by the MFA's Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar, the MFA's Center for Policy Research gave intelligence briefs on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon to further support the argument that these countries could become future foes. Policy Research Center interlocutors reviewed succession concerns in both Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  Bar argued that a perceived closure in the capability gap between Israel and Arab states, coupled with a nuclear-armed Iran, could compel moderate Arab states to reassess the notion that Israel was a fixture in the region.  7. (S) Typically frank, MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad was not certain how much longer Egyptian President Mubarak would live, and questioned whether his son Gamal was ready to assume command.  Gilad said the Egyptian military led by Defense Minister Tantawi continues to train and exercise as if "Israel was its only enemy."  He added that there were disturbing signs on the Egyptian streets, as women are dressed more conservatively, and that peace with Israel "is too thin, too superficial."  On Saudi Arabia, Gilad said that King Abdullah does not hate Israel, but his chief priority is the survival of the regime.  8. (S) The GOI official response to the arms transfer non-paper includes several objections, such as the potential transfer of systems for the F-15SA to Saudi Arabia, including the Enhanced Paveway II, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, and AESA radar.  Buchris said the GOI is ready to establish a working group to discuss the F-15SA transfer, and proposed an Israeli technical team accompany BG Heymann to Washington (in town for a missile defense meeting) on August 3 to discuss the issue further.  Buchris said the sale of the F-15SA was not the problem, but rather the weapons systems included on the planes and the location of the planes in Saudi Arabia.  Lebanon -------  9. (S) The GOI remains concerned about U.S. arms transfers to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), and has requested the opportunity to discuss further U.S. intentions regarding the LAF.  A/S Shapiro said the results of the Lebanese elections represented a turning point, and rejection of Hizballah and its Iranian sponsors.  The need to build up Lebanese institutions, including the army, was now more important than ever, he argued.  A/S Shapiro said the LAF has thus far demonstrated a solid record of accounting for U.S. systems transferred to Lebanon.  10. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the elections in Lebanon were positive, but countered that Hizballah's influence remains strong.  He argued that items such as the Cessna Caravan and the Raven unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) lack sufficient mitigation measures, which creates the potential for an incident along the Israel-Lebanese border.  Amos Gilad said the GOI does not believe the LAF will attack Israel. However, given the ties between Hizballah and the LAF, he was certain the IDF would eventually face the LAF in any conflict with Hizballah.  11. (S) Analysts from the MFA's Center for Policy Research argued there has been no dramatic change in the political arena despite the March 14 coalition's significant victory in the elections.  They said the fragile political situation in Lebanon is currently stable, but Hizballah still possesses an unofficial veto over policy.  Long term prospects will be tested by the Hariri Tribunal and Hizballah's desire for a reprisal to the 2008 Mughniyeh assassination.  MFA Policy Research analysts further argued that the LAF faces tremendous pressure following the recent explosion of a Hizballah arms cache near the Lebanese-Israeli border.  MFA DG Yossi Gal noted that UNIFIL had been prevented from investigating the explosion, and raised the recent crossing by Lebanese citizens into Israeli territory to plant Lebanese and Hizballah flags.  He said French and Italian delegations had praised the GOI's restraint in these cases.  12. (S) A/S Shapiro asked if the election results might be the result in part of a backlash in the Christian community against Hizballah; the Policy Research analysts countered that the results were indicative of several factors, including the influx of Saudi money and an unstable opposition camp.  They agreed that Hizballah leader Nasrallah might be a bit chastened following the elections, as suggested by A/S Shapiro, but that Hizballah continues to try and undermine the March 14 coalition.  13. (S) During the MOD roundtable discussion, BG Heymann also acknowledged the positive results of the elections.  However, he feared the outcome did not represent the real power of the Shi'ites in Lebanon.  He agreed that moderates and the LAF must be strengthened, but expressed deep concerns about ongoing cooperation between Hizballah and the LAF.  He also said that such aid to Lebanon be paired with efforts to halt smuggling and directly weaken Hizballah.  14. (S) BG Heymann also cited concerns regarding mitigation measures for the Caravan and Raven in order to prevent an "accidental engagement" by the IAF.  Overall, he was skeptical that these systems would benefit the LAF, and said the GOI would appreciate a more in-depth conversation regarding U.S. intentions and overarching strategy with respect to the LAF.  Heymann suggested further talks to coincide with the August 3rd F-15 technical discussion in Washington; MFA DDG Bar echoed this request.  A/S Shapiro offered to take that back to Washington for review.  If it proved too difficult on short notice to bring together interagency experts to discuss US intentions with the LAF, A/S Shapiro suggested it be included in the Joint Political Military Group talks later in the fall.  Iran ----  15. (S) Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons remains the GOI's primary focus.  Buchris stated bluntly that it was not clear to him where U.S. policy was heading with regard to Iran.  In separate meetings, Buchris and Amos Gilad said that Israel's preeminent priority is to prevent Iran's nuclear weapons program, which if realized would cause a nuclear arms race across the Middle East as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt pursue similar programs in response.  Gilad was skeptical  that engagement would work, noting Iranian desires to "establish a new empire" and pointing to Iranian support for Hizballah and "Hamastan." Buchris added that the United States' desire to engage with Iran should be accompanied by tough sanctions, and only pursued for a finite period of time; MFA DG Gal concurred.  Alluding to a potential military strike, Buchris said "all options must remain on the table," and acknowledged that part of his job was insuring Israel was ready to employ such an option, no matter how undesirable it may be.  16. (S) A/S Shapiro made clear that a nuclear armed Iran was unacceptable to the United States.  He referenced Secretary Clinton's July 15 foreign policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations, noting the offer of engagement with Iran -- but reinforcing that such an offer is not indefinite.  A/S Shapiro argued that an Iranian rejection of our offer to engage will only help bolster international support for increased sanctions.  He also pointed to the uncertain situation following the Iranian elections -- it was unclear at this point how the regime in Tehran will react to our offer of engagement.  That said, he repeated that the engagement offer was not unlimited, noting that the United States will reassess its engagement strategy with Iran later this fall.  17. (S) A/S Shapiro cited a commonality of interests with the Gulf States, which also view Iran as the preeminent threat -- we should take advantage of this commonality, he said. During the J5 roundtable discussion, IDF interlocutors expressed skepticism that proposed military assistance to the Gulf would help against Iran, as some of the systems slated for delivery are not designed to counter the threats, nuclear and asymmetrical, posed by Iran.  A/S Shapiro agreed that assistance to Gulf states should not diminish Israel's QME, but argued that it sends a signal to those countries (as well as Iran) that they have strong allies in the West.  It also helps convince these regimes that their best interests lie with the moderate camp rather than with Iran.  18. (S) Buchris said the lack of an appointed U.S. special envoy focusing on Iran suggested the United States did not believe Iran was a priority.  A/S Shapiro reassured Buchris that Iran was a top priority as President Obama and Secretary Clinton are intensely focused on Iran.  The fact that Tehran has not responded to our offer of engagement makes a special envoy responsible for negotiations not as important, A/S Shapiro said -- in any case, much of the discussion will be behind the scenes.  19. (S) Buchris referenced a press report from Secretary Clinton's trip to Jakarta in which she said the United States would consider providing a defense umbrella for moderate Arab countries in the Middle East should Iran acquire a nuclear weapon.  Buchris argued that such a statement already conceded the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran.  MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar also raised the Secretary's Jakarta statement; A/S Shapiro stated that the Secretary's comments did not indicate a new policy approach, but were meant as a deterrent factor toward Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions -- not as a concession -- and that journalists covering the trip attempted to make more out of the statement than was intended.  20. (S) Amos Gilad referenced Russia's potential sale of the S-300 missile system to Iran, noting that Russian interlocutors initially denied the S-300 contract with Iran, and then later admitted it had been signed but added that the system would not be delivered for political reasons. However, Gilad said the Russians would reassess this political calculation should the United States continue to pursue missile defense plans in Poland and the Czech Republic.  He speculated that the Iranians would continue to put pressure on Russia to sell the system rather than pursue alternative Chinese systems.  He said the Russians appear committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but he personally had doubts about their intelligence capabilities following their lack of knowledge regarding the Syrian nuclear project.  Peace Process -------------  21. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority was doing a "good job" in the West Bank, noting respect for Palestinian Security Forces (PASF) as they take more control of security -- giving them the chance to succeed was important, Buchris said.  He also commended the work of United States Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton in training the PASF.  That said, Buchris argued the way ahead would be difficult, given the divide between Hamas and Fatah. Reconciliation talks between the two have stalled -- Amos Gilad said both sides are "more interested in swallowing one another" than negotiating.  Behind the scenes discussions with Hamas by European countries and even U.S. visitors have not helped the situation, Buchris said.  A/S Shapiro deferred to Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell's efforts, but noted Secretary Clinton's point that a stronger PA will offer an alternative to Hamas.  He also stressed Secretary Clinton's remarks during her July 15 speech that the United States will not engage with Hamas unless it has accepted the Quartet principles.  Export Control --------------  22. (C) MOD Defense Export Control Directorate (DECD) Chief Eli Pincu reviewed the export control system, emphasizing an improved process, but also acknowledging the potential for improvement.  He gave a brief presentation regarding Israeli export controls, including enhanced legislation, cross-ministry coordination, enhanced enforcement, and increased industry outreach and training.  He noted 780 registered exporters in Israel; for 2009, 31,373 marketing licenses had thus far been issued, with 1,198 denials and 219 returned without action.  MFA Export Control Director Roey Gilad stressed the partnership between the MOD and MFA on export licenses, and explained the system's dispute resolution mechanism in the event the MFA and MOD disagree on a particular case.  23. (C) Both Pincu and Roey Gilad noted that the GOI continues to seek assistance in closing export control loopholes, including brokering.  Pincu noted that brokering had been included in the Defense Export Control Act, but that accompanying implementation legislation had not yet entered in to force.  Pincu said the GOI had consulted with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan on its brokering laws, and planned to raise it during the annual defense export control working group to be held in Washington in October. Roey Gilad and other DECD officials also hope to travel to Washington in the near future to further discuss brokering issues.  China -----  24. (C) MFA Export Control Director Roey Gilad reiterated that the GOI in no way desires to compromise U.S. national interests with respect to exports to China.  He noted, however, that the U.S. Department of Commerce created in 2007 a list of exemptions for certain items if sent to validated end users in China.  Gilad questioned whether the same exemptions might be possible for Israel.  As it currently stands, the GOI must pursue any export to China through the bilateral statement of understanding with the United States. While the statement calls for expeditious resolution of any requests to export to China, it often takes up to 80 days to obtain approval.  By that time, Gilad said, China has often found the item through another supplier.  Moreover, the Israeli export control system requires a 20-working day turn-around on all export license requests -- which is not possible, given the length of time required to obtain an answer from the United States.  A/S Shapiro offered to raise the issue in Washington.  JPMG ----  25. (SBU) A/S Shapiro suggested the next session of the Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) convene shortly after the Jewish holidays, most likely in October or early November. GOI officials agreed in principle, and will look at the calendar and propose dates.  26.  (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared this cable.  ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM
S E C R E T TEL AVIV 002482  NOFORN SIPDIS  NEA FOR A/S FELTMAN; NSC FO DAN SHAPIRO; OSD FOR USD-P FLOURNOY E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MOPS PTER KWBG EG SY IR SA LE TUIS SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE VERSHBOW MEETS WITH SENIOR ISRAELI DEFENSE OFFICIALS  Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)  This is a re-transmission of USDAO TEL AVIV 3188.  1. (C) SUMMARY: On November 1 and 2, Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for International Security Affairs, Ambassador Alexander Vershbow, met with a number of senior Israeli defense officials in Israel including: Ministry of Defense (MOD) Director General (DG) Pinchas Buchris; Head of MOD Political Military Bureau Amos Gilad; Assistant Chief of Defense Major General (MG) Benny Gantz; and Head of MOD Intelligence Analysis Production Brigadier General Yossi Baidatz.  The Israelis expressed positive views on continued U.S.-Israel cooperation particularly on Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) and the ongoing Juniper Cobra missile defense exercise.  Israeli officials explained that they were going through an unprecedented period of calm due to the deterrent effect of Operation CAST LEAD, but that below the surface were a number of significant dangers.  They continued to emphasize that Iran represents the greatest strategic threat to the region, both its nuclear program and its "axis" with Syria, Hezbollah, and HAMAS.  They also expressed skepticism about Palestinian President Abbas's future, given his weakened position as a result of his handling of the Goldstone Report and his inability to get the full settlement freeze he had pushed for; they questioned his ability to restart peace negotiations.  Israeli officials were concerned about the deteriorating Turkey-Israel relationship and discussed threats emanating from both Syria and Lebanon. END SUMMARY  ------------------- Bilateral Relations -------------------  2. (S) ASD Vershbow's trip to Israel came as a number of high-level Israeli and American officials were meeting on key issues.  On October 31, Secretary of State Clinton arrived in Jerusalem for talks on the peace process with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, and Foreign Minster Lieberman.  In addition, EUCOM Commander Admiral Stavridis arrived in Israel on November 1 to observe the Juniper Cobra-10 ballistic missile defense exercise.  The ASD's visit also came in the wake of recent high-level discussions on Israel's QME in Washington, and the October 21 meeting of the Joint Politico-Military Group in Tel Aviv.  3. (S) On QME, ASD Vershbow asked for Israel's assessment of recent discussions, and across the board, Israeli officials expressed gratitude for U.S. efforts on this front and voiced optimism on the steps moving forward.  Amos Gilad acknowledged the sometimes difficult position the U.S. finds itself in given its global interests, and conceded that Israel's security focus is so narrow that its QME concerns often clash with broader American security interests in the region.  Israeli officials acknowledged the impressive nature of the QME dialogue mechanisms recently established, but stated that the results of the process are what truly matter.  MG Benny Gantz defined successful QME relations as "the effective process plus the right mitigations."  While not explicitly saying it, Gantz seemed to acknowledge that Israel does not expect that all QME decisions will break in its favor, but that Israel only expects a fair and equitable process that incorporates "intimate dialogue."  DG Buchris thanked Versbhow for the recent success of the JPMG and said he looks forward to convening the first meeting of the agreed upon working groups by the end of November.  Vershbow stated that the technical working group discussions would be launched soon, and that he was looking forward to future Israeli participation on this issue.  ------------------------ Iran Remains Top of Mind ------------------------  4. (S) Israeli officials continue to uniformly emphasize that Iran's nuclear program and regional hegemonic ambitions are the greatest strategic threats to Israel.  They view Iran as the center of a radical axis that includes Syria, Hezbollah and HAMAS.  5. (S//NF) Israel continues to offer a worst-case assessment of the Iranian nuclear program, emphasizing that the window for stopping the program (by military means if necessary) is  rapidly closing.  General Baidatz argued that it would take Iran one year to obtain a nuclear weapon and two and a half years to build an arsenal of three weapons.  By 2012 Iran would be able to build one weapon within weeks and an arsenal within six months.  (COMMENT:  It is unclear if the Israelis firmly believe this or are using worst-case estimates to raise greater urgency from the United States).  Amos Gilad explained his view of the repercussions of an Iranian nuclear capability stating that it would give Iran a free hand in supporting "HAMAStan" in Gaza and "Hezbollahstan" in Lebanon.  Gilad also argued that Saudi Arabia would definitely react to a nuclear Iran by obtaining a weapon (with Pakistani assistance) and Egypt would almost certainly follow.  He was less sure about whether Turkey would respond by pursuing a nuclear weapon. Regardless, the security situation in the region surrounding Israel would be dramatically altered should Iran acquire a nuclear weapons capability.  6. (S//NF) ASD Vershbow queried various Israeli officials about their view of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal and Iran's recent equivocation on the agreement. Israeli officials uniformly expressed support for the agreement but made clear that by itself it was not sufficient.  They stated that it was only one stop on the way to containing the Iranian nuclear program and that it must be followed by a freeze-for-freeze agreement and eventually the full suspension of uranium enrichment, as well as the end of work on the newly disclosed site at Qom.  They warned that the TRR agreement by itself could serve as a major victory for Iran if it legitimized in the world's eyes Iran's right to enrich uranium on its own soil.  None of the Israeli officials expressed surprise about Iran's apparent reversal on the TRR agreement, as they viewed this as typical Iranian negotiating style and part of an Iranian strategy of delay. Amos Gilad stated that Iran would never agree to anything that contradicted its overall strategic goal of achieving a nuclear weapons capability.  7. (S) When queried about how the U.S. views the Iranian response, ASD Vershbow explained that the United States was still seeking greater clarity on what was the real Iranian bottom line.  We may need time to ascertain whether Iran's response was in fact a serious walk-back or whether it would be willing to abide by the initial TRR agreement that had been agreed to in principle in Geneva on October 1.  However, he also emphasized that American patience is not unlimited and that if the TRR agreement did collapse, the U.S. would likely begin pursuing the pressure track.  8. (S//NF) Israel was also highly concerned about Iran's support for proxies, with General Baidatz emphasizing that there are multiple bases in Iran where IRGC, Quds Force, Hezbollah, HAMAS, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives all train together and share knowledge.  MG Gantz also emphasized Iran's role as a weapons supplier to Syria and that Syria actively facilitated arms transfers to Hezbollah. He expressed concern about Iranian shipments of weapons via Sudan to Egypt and into Gaza.  On the Russian delay in delivery of the S-300 (SA-20) to Iran, Gilad voiced satisfaction with the train of events, acknowledging Prime Minister Netanyahu's "secret" visit to Moscow and President Obama's engagement with Medvedev had both played a role. Gilad was worried about Russian readiness to support tough sanctions on Iran.  ASD Vershbow said the Russians' signals on sanctions were mixed, but they seemed genuinely concerned about recent Iranian missile tests and the revelation of the Qom facility.  ------------------- West Bank and Gaza -------------------  9. (S) Of particular interest throughout the meetings was the subject of the Palestinian political situation.  It was widely agreed that President Abbas is currently in a weakened political state, and Israeli officials generally cast a dour assessment of Abbas's future.  In one exchange, Amos Gilad stated his opinion that Abbas will not survive politically past the year 2011.  Gilad further stated that Abbas is facing unprecedented criticism within the Palestinian Authority over his handling of the Goldstone report, and that this, coupled with a stubborn HAMAS, has weakened Abbas considerably.  The Israelis said the perception in the Arab world was that the U.S. had encouraged Abbas to take  difficult positions on Goldstone and settlements only to walk away from him.  ASD Vershbow queried Gilad over measures that could be taken to bolster Abbas.  Gilad responded by stating that Israeli-Palestinian peace discussions need to be resumed immediately, but without preconditions, and that both parties need to seek further cooperation on a range of issues -- specifically on the security sector front.  Gilad expressed optimism over the current atmosphere in the West Bank, citing improvements in the security and economic spheres, and further stated that the reduced Israeli Defense Force (IDF) footprint in the West Bank has made conditions ripe for advancing the relationship.  Gilad closed, however, on a sourer note by stating that the Government of Israel has little faith in the Palestinian negotiating team.  10. (S) ASD Vershbow transitioned off the political discussion to focus on the Palestinian Authority Security Force (PASF).  Specifically, Vershbow highlighted the concern that Palestinian forces were seen as lacking real authority, and therefore asked for steps that could be taken to give the PASF more visible control of security.  Israeli officials responded by citing the decreased number of direct- action incursions, checkpoints and patrols, and seemingly drew a correlation between reduced IDF activity and increased PASF authority (COMMENT:  Despite Israeli assurances, U.S. and Palestinian officials continue to highlight the corrosive effect of regular Israeli incursions).  MG Gantz cited Palestinian security sector reform as a major accomplishment, stating that on-the-ground coordination between the PASF and IDF units has improved dramatically. Despite these positive developments though, Israeli officials repeatedly underscored the importance of retaining the right to disrupt terrorist operations in the West Bank and Gaza.  Additionally, they stated that if Israel allowed a weak and untrained security force to take over in the West Bank in the short term, the result will be deterioration of the Israel-Jordan relationship over the long term.  The prospect of poor Israeli-Jordanian relations, according to Amos Gilad, is unacceptable, and would result in the loss of "strategic depth" for Israel.  11. (S) ASD Vershbow urged his Israeli counterparts not to soley focus on the short-term "here and now," but rathr to envision the possible benefits that a strongand viable West Bank could have for Israel's secrity situation in the future.  Vershbow used thi point to springboard to the issue of HAMAS and aza, asking whether success in the West Bank coud serve as a "magnet" and help solve the Gaza problem. He asked if Israel had made any headway in tems of an information operations campaign to better communicate with the people of Gaza.  Israeli officials offered very little in the way of a communications strategy or long-term vision for the territories, but reinforced Israel's core belief that HAMAS has only sinister motives, and that any attempt Fatah might make to improve its standing in Gaza would only be met with HAMAS opposition.  General Baidatz articulated Israel's concern by highlighting recent intelligence that HAMAS is trying to acquire from Iran (and potentially test-fired the previous weekend) the 60 km-range Fajr-5 rocket that could reach Tel Aviv.  These actions, according to Baidatz and other officials, make any discussion of Palestinian reconciliation both premature and unrealistic.  Ambassador Vershbow sought further clarification on this point, querying Israeli officials over the level of public support for HAMAS.  Specifically, the ASD asked if there was any way to undermine support for HAMAS vis-a-vis the peace process. Amos Gilad responded simply by saying that one of Israel's biggest concerns is the atmosphere created by disjointed peace talks.  Specifically, Gilad stated that political promises of peace, unification, and reconciliation -- concepts that are never realized -- are only resulting in a climate of uncertainty that is unhealthy.  On this matter, Gilad mentioned that Egypt's role in pushing reconciliation is not helpful and often counterproductive, but that he expects Egypt to continue floating the idea at future junctures.  12. (C) In bringing up the Goldstone Report, DG Buchris emphasized that the Government of Israel took extraordinary steps to mitigate civilian casualties, despite HAMAS's deliberate use of civilians as human shields.  He stated that the IDF made over 300,000 phone calls to alert civilians before bombing legitimate military targets.  He also compared Israeli operations in Gaza to U.S. operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan and stated that Israel would do whatever was necessary to protect its population.  In response, ASD Vershbow recalled U.S. support for Israel in handling of the Goldstone report, and offered to share U.S. experience in investigating incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan as the GOI considered whether to conduct an additional investigation.  -------------------- Anxiety Over Turkey --------------------  13. (S) Israeli officials also expressed growing anxiety over the Turkey-Israel relationship after the Turkish cancellation of Israel's participation in the ANATOLIAN EAGLE joint exercise.  They expressed their belief that the strategic relationship with Turkey is critical, but that PM Erdogan's views have increasingly penetrated into the military and have been part of the reason for the deterioration in relations as Turkey looks East rather than West.  Gilad believes this is understandable as Turkey's EU accession prospects look increasingly doubtful, and they must balance their relations with both regions to succeed.  14. (S) Baidatz stated that the Turks have an agenda to contain any Kurdish influence in Iraq and that to achieve it they need to improve their relations with Iran and Syria.  In his view, the worst possible outcome would be a new Turkey-Iran-Syria-Iraq axis in the Middle East.  Gilad also noted that Turkey wanted to improve its relationships with Iran and asserted that it had made some very aggressive plans recently to support HAMAS.  However, he had a less pessimistic view than Baidatz, stating that Turkey had played a positive role in Iraq and that generally the Turks' agenda was for a stable Iraq that would be commercially beneficial to Turkey.  Gilad stated that he was skeptical of any political rapprochement between Israel and Turkey in the near term, but that Israel would continue to foster the military-to-military relationship because of its strategic importance.  15. (C) Gilad also queried ASD Vershbow about what Israel might do to improve its relationship with Turkey.  Vershbow explained that Turkey wants to be influential in the region and that if it jeopardizes its relationship with Israel, it will undermine its status and its leverage as an evenhanded mediator.  He also commented that Erdogan's ideological views may lead him to focus on Turkey's Islamic neighbors, but he is also a realist who will not want to jeopardize Turkey's ties to the U.S. or NATO.  The U.S. and Israel should be patient with Turkey and stay engaged, encouraging the Turks to play a constructive role in the region.  He stated that at the upcoming bilateral defense talks between the U.S. and Turkey in December, he and Under Secretary Flournoy would emphasize the need to improve Israel-Turkey relations.  ---------------------------- Quiet on the Northern Border ----------------------------  16. (S) Israeli officials remain pleased with the "quiet" nature of its northern border -- something they attribute to the deterrent effect Israel has built up following OPERATION CAST LEAD and the 2006 war in Lebano.  However, according to Israeli officials, it i a foregone conclusion that strong cooperation eists between the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and ezbollah.  The level of cooperation far exceeds wht many assume is simply the day-to-day problem of corruption within the ranks.  On the contrary, Israel believes that LAF/Hezbollah cooperation is a matter of national policy. Amos Gilad attributed this dynamic to elements of nationalism, stating that Lebanese government and military officials choose not to confront Hezbollah out of patriotic zeal.  Moreover, according to Gilad, any information shared with the United Nations Interim Force-Lebanon (UNIFIL) goes directly to Hezbollah by way of the LAF.  17. (S) Israeli officials have major concerns over developments within Hezbollah -- specifically, its relationship with Syria and Iran.  General Baidatz spoke of this relationship and drew attention to the existing supply of Fateh-110 long-range missile that Iran sent to Syria. Israeli officials believe these missiles are destined for Hezbollah.  According to Baidatz and others, if the delivery were to occur, this would significantly alter Israel's  calculus.  Under such a scenario, the looming question for Israeli policymakers then becomes: "to strike or not to strike."  ----------------- Optimism on Syria -----------------  18. (S) General Baidatz offered an Israeli intelligence assessment that if Syria were able to achieve peace with security and obtain greater U.S. involvement, it may pull away from Iran's orbit.  He explained that President Assad used his "negative assets," namely Hezbollah and HAMAS, to make himself relevant and that ultimately Assad wants it all:  the Golan Heights; peace with Israel; better relations with the U.S.; a strong relationship with Iran; and a continued relationship with Hezbollah.  Ultimately, Gen Baidatz asserted that if Assad had to choose one thing, it would likely be peace with Israel.  ASD Vershbow asked if Hezbollah could be sustained without Syrian support.  Baidatz acknowledged the difficulty in answering this question, but stated his belief that it would be a gradual process before Hezbollah could completely wean itself from the Syrian support apparatus and that, ultimately, both Hezbollah's and Iran's flexibility would be significantly reduced.  ------------------------------- Mil-to-Mil Relations with Egypt -------------------------------  19. (C) Amos Gilad commented that he would like to see a complete peace with Egypt, but noted there was very little in the way of Egyptian-Israeli military relations and that Egypt continued to train its military for war with Israel.  Gilad stated that Egypt was not likely to attack Israel and did not represent a short-term threat, but that at the very least it was necessary to have modest contact between Egyptian and Israeli officers.  He expressed frustration by describing Egypt and Israel's "frozen peace" and that neither side knows anything about the other.  He noted that the last high-level military visit for Egypt was in 1991.  20. (S//NF) Israeli officials agreed that Egypt's counter-smuggling efforts have improved, particularly since Operation CAST LEAD in January.  However, they stated that gaps still exist and that Egypt needs to focus its efforts on stopping Bedouin smuggling in the Sinai.  Gilad said he was disillusioned with the technical monitoring solution; tunnels continue and smuggling is increasing even with U.S. assistance along borders with Egypt.  --------------------------------------------- --------------- Iron Dome and Juniper Cobra - Strengthening the Relationship --------------------------------------------- ---------------  21. (S) On Iron Dome, DG Buchris (Assisted by retired General Nagel) briefed ASD Vershbow on the latest developments, stating that Iron Dome is planned to have an initial operating capability by the spring of 2010, and that technological advancements have made the system much more viable defending against short range rocket attacks from Gaza or Southern Lebanon.  Buchris also emphasized the need for additional USG support to help fund additional production of Iron Dome to protect the civilian population in both the North and the South.  Buchris also noted progress on the upper- and medium-tier ballistic missile defense systems (Arrow-3 and David's Sling, respectively).  In an earlier meeting, MG Gantz quantified the importance of fielding adequate missile defense systems by citing critical Israeli infrastructure such as Ben Gurion Airport and the Ashkelon electricity plant.  Suffering the loss or damage of places such as these, according to Gantz, would be a major blow to Israel and, therefore, every effort to stand up a capable missile and rocket defense shield should be taken.  22. (S) After Gantz highlighted three areas of focus for the IDF (deterring conventional threats, responding nimbly to asymmetric threats, and developing an integrated missile defense system), ASD Vershbow asked for Gantz's initial impression of the Juniper Cobra-10 exercise.  Gantz stressed the importance of this exercise, and stated that so far it had been a success.  ASD Vershbow stated that the timing of Juniper Cobra was somewhat fortuitous, given the recent  developments with Iran.  On the larger issue of missile defense, ASD Vershbow stressed U.S. efforts to try and persuade Russia to become more involved in missile defense cooperation, but stated that Russia's realization that the new U.S. missile defense approach in Europe is more effective than the previous one is causing the Russian leadership to ask many questions about the system.  ------- Summary -------  23. (S) All of ASD Vershbow's interlocutors carried a consistent message emphasizing that:  Iran remains Israel's greatest threat; recent events have weakened President Abbas; the PASF have performed well in the West Bank; and the relative calm on all Israel's borders does not obscure the fact that Israeli intelligence is seeing significant activity and planning by Iranian surrogates, namely HAMAS and Hezbollah, with facilitation from Syria.  These threats suggest that Israel must remain vigilant and prepared for the calm to end one day.  24. (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this message. CUNNINGHAM
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 002500  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/17/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MOPS PTER EG CH IR RU SA LE TU ISSUBJECT: 40TH JOINT POLITICAL-MILITARY GROUP: EXECUTIVE SESSION (PART 1 OF 4)  Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b,d)  1. (S) Summary:  During the Executive Session of the 40th Joint Political Military Group (JPMG), U.S. and Israeli counterparts continued discussion on the creation of four new Qualitative Military Edge (QME) working groups.  GOI interlocutors continued to raise concerns regarding the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia.  Both sides agreed that continued pressure be applied to Iran, especially following the disclosure of the nuclear facility in Qom.  GOI participants expressed concern regarding Chinese and Russian cooperation with respect to enhanced Iranian sanctions.  The GOI also raised dual citizenship concerns with respect to access to sensitive technology, and noted from its perspective Turkey's disturbing change of course toward Syria and Iran -- and away from Israel.  This is the first in four cables (septels) reporting on the JPMG.  End summary.  2. (SBU) Israeli Participants:  -- Brigadier General (res) Pinchas Buchris, MOD Director General -- Major General (ret) Amos Gilad, MOD Political-Military Chief -- Brigadier General Ronen Dan, acting Israeli Defense Attache to the United States -- Gad Dovev, Director, MOD Mission, New York -- Alon Bar, MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs -- COL Shimon Arad, IDF J5 -- Rami Yungman, MOD Political-Military Bureau -- Schmuel Royter, Assistant to the MOD Director General  U.S. Participants:  -- Andrew Shapiro, Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs -- Luis Moreno, Deputy Chief of Mission, U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv -- Dr. Colin Kahl, International Security Affairs, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense -- Brigadier General Jefforey Smith, Joint Staff -- Prem Kumar, Director for Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian Affairs, NSC -- Tom Goldberger, Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs -- COL Richard Burgess, Defense Attache, U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv  Qualitative Military Edge -------------------------  3. (S) The Executive Session continued discussion from the September 30 Qualitative Military Edge (QME) meeting in Washington.  Both sides presented their primary points of contact for the four newly proposed working groups focusing on previous agreements, mitigation measures for the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia, technical mitigation issues, and intelligence/policy.  Agreement was reached to begin working on the details of each working group's meeting schedule and timeline.  4. (S) The GOI continued to express concern over the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia.  U.S. participants noted that the USG is unable to provide more detailed information about the sale until Saudi Arabia officially sends a Letter of Request (LOR).  The GOI expressed additional concerns about stationing these new aircraft at Tabuk airfield in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia -- close to the Israeli border.  U.S. participants stated the USG understanding that this should not be an issue, as the Saudis are considering stationing new Typhoon aircraft at Tabuk.  The GOI also raised AMRAAM sales to Jordan; U.S. participants explained that the new C-7 AMRAAM is an export version with capabilities similar to the C-5 version -- and therefore provides little to no increase in capabilities.  Iran, China and Russia ----------------------  5. (S) Both sides expressed concern over the recent revelation regarding Iran's nuclear facility at Qom, and agreed that increased pressure should be applied directly and internationally against Iran in order to better determine Tehran's motives and next steps.  Both sides agreed that the facility at Qom should be inspected immediately.  One member of the Israeli delegation expressed the opinion that some consideration be given to "shutting Qom operations down completely" to prevent further progress on obtaining a nuclear weapon.  That said, the GOI argued that the international community not become bogged down on the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) and Qom, thereby diverting focus from  TEL AVIV 00002500  002 OF 002   the bigger issue of Iran's nuclear program.  6. (S) Several questions were raised about China's position on Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.  Both sides agreed that continued engagement with China and Russia is needed -- as well as building a consensus in Europe.  The USG speculated, and the GOI concurred, that China will follow Moscow's lead.  USG participants argued that China would seek to avoid an international confrontation over Iran. The GOI described 2010 as a critical year -- if the Iranians continue to protect and harden their nuclear sites, it will be more difficult to target and damage them.  Both sides then discussed the upcoming delivery of GBU-28 bunker busting bombs to Israel, noting that the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the USG is helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran.  7. (S) The GOI made the case for "crippling sanctions"; cooperation between the United States, Europe, Russia and China will be necessary in order for these sanctions to be effective.  U.S. participants stressed the USG position that any discussions with Iran on this subject be finite; the USG will continue to monitor whether negotiations are making progress.  The GOI stated that it is not convinced the Iranians will negotiate in good faith unless there are visible and clear threats.  U.S. delegation members described eight lanes of sanctions, and outlined a plan to "pivot to apply appropriate pressure" on those points and tracks that have the most impact.  U.S. participants concurred that 2010 is a critical year -- but the continued application of pressure is vital.  8. (S) Regarding Russia, the GOI was not confident that Moscow will be helpful in any Iranian sanctions effort -- GOI participants opined that Russia is considered a "mystery" with respect to their views on Iran.  The GOI raised the Russian S-300 sale to Iran, noting that the transfer is still pending.  GOI participants argued that Moscow seeks a return to superpower status, but there are contradictory trends regarding Russia's internal condition.  Dual Citizenship Issues -----------------------  9. (S) The GOI raised the issue of dual citizenship within the context of access to sensitive technology.  U.S. participants acknowledged Israeli concerns, noting that the issue is being worked at the highest levels of the USG to reach consensus on how to proceed.  The GOI recommended obtaining a waiver similar to the relationship from which Canada or Australia benefit.  Turkey ------  10. (S) The GOI raised the current direction the Government of Turkey has taken toward Syria and Iran -- and away from Israel.  Israeli participants argued that Turkey has been supportive of Hamas in Gaza while pursuing a more "Islamic" direction with the goal of becoming a regional superpower. The GOI argued that the Turkish military is losing its ability to influence government decisions and strategic direction.  After this past year, GOI participants said they have a "bad feeling" about Turkey.  The GOI noted that the Israel Air Force (IAF) Commander in the past wanted to speak to the Turkish Air Force Commander, but his Turkish counterpart declined.  11.  (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared on this cable. CUNNINGHAM
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 002502  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV MOPS PTER KWBG EG IR SA LE ISSUBJECT: 40TH JPMG: NEA REGIONAL DISCUSSION (PART 3 OF 4)  Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)  1. (S) Summary:  As part of the 40th Joint Political Military Group (JPMG), U.S. and GOI counterparts discussed security issues in the Near East region.  GOI officials expressed support for the P5 plus 1 engagement process with Iran, but doubted the process would lead to any change in Iranian behavior -- Iran will use the engagement process as an opportunity to continue its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro stressed that engagement with Tehran was not "open ended"; the United States is preparing sanctions in the event engagement does not prove successful.  GOI interlocutors continued to express concerns regarding U.S. support of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF); U.S. participants reiterated U.S. support of the LAF as a counterweight to Hizballah.  A/S Shapiro noted NEA, with PM participation and support, plans to brief the GOI on the U.S. policy regarding Lebanon in the near future.  In a continuation from the JPMG Executive Session, GOI interlocutors made the argument that U.S. arms transfers in the region could potentially arm future enemies of Israel.  GOI officials expressed frustration over the Goldstone Report; U.S. officials advocated sharing lessons learned regarding confronting terrorists in civilian-populated areas.  GOI officials noted improved counter-smuggling efforts from Egypt regarding arms transfers to Gaza via the Sinai.  However, they argued that Egypt can and should do more to prevent the flow of arms.  U.S. delegation members also briefed on U.S. policy in Iraq, and expressed concerns about the current situation in Yemen. This is the third of four cables (septels) reporting on the JPMG.  End summary.  2. (SBU) Main Israeli Participants:  -- Brigadier General (res) Pinchas Buchris, MOD Director General -- Major General (ret) Amos Gilad, MOD Political-Military Chief -- Brigadier General Ronen Dan, acting Israeli Defense Attache to the United States -- Gad Dovev, Director, MOD Mission, New York -- Alon Bar, MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs -- COL Shimon Arad, IDF J5 -- Rami Yungman, MOD Political-Military Bureau -- Schmuel Royter, Assistant to the MOD Director General  Main U.S. Participants:  -- Andrew Shapiro, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs -- James Hursch, Director, DTSA -- Dr. Colin Kahl, International Security Affairs, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense -- Brigadier General Jefforey Smith, Joint Staff -- Beth McCormick, Deputy Director, DSCA -- Prem Kumar, Director for Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian Affairs, NSC -- Tom Goldberger, Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs -- COL Richard Burgess, Defense Attache, U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv -- Robert Maggi, PM Coordinator for Counter Piracy -- Kevin Maloney, Licensing Director, PM/DTCL  Plenary -------  3. (S) MOD Director General Pinchas Buchris began the plenary, stating this was "perhaps the most important JPMG to date."  He pointed to the threat of a nuclear Iran, and expressed hope that U.S. leadership will find a way to stop Iran.  Otherwise, a nuclear-armed Iran will "impact the stability of the world," Buchris said.  A/S Shapiro described this 40th JPMG as a key forum and the primary mechanism in the political-military dialogue between the United States and Israel.  He said the United States wants to "re-energize" the JPMG, with the goal to "bring back strategic elements" into the discussion.  A/S Shapiro highlighted the importance of mutual understanding and transparent dialogue.  Iran ----  4. (S) MOD Political-Military Director Amos Gilad presented a strategic overview.  He began with Iran, reciting President Obama's statement made during a visit to Israel prior to becoming president that the United States would not tolerate a nuclear Iran.  Gilad said Israel concurs, and described current dialogue with Iran as the "most sensitive stage" and Iran's "last chance."  He said Iran remains determined to  TEL AVIV 00002502  002 OF 004   reach the "nuclear option," which he described as "intolerable."  He quoted former President and Ahmadinejad opponent Rafsanjani as saying Iran "only needs one bomb for Israel," implying that Iran will continue to threaten Israel regardless of its leadership.  5. (S) A/S Shapiro noted that the United States shares Israel's concerns that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program.  He said that the United States is beginning with engagement, but at the same time is preparing tougher measures should engagement fail.  A/S Shapiro stressed that engagement was not "open ended" -- the United States needs to see concrete steps and tangible results from the P5 1 talks. He noted concerns over the Qom facility; if Iran does not respond to engagement, then the United States will move toward stronger steps such as sanctions.  DASD Kahl reiterated that it is not our intention to allow Iran to "run out the clock," and noted that engagement also serves to build international consensus on sanctions.  MFA Deputy Director for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar argued that the United States must present a clearer message to the Europeans on what is expected of them regarding sanctions.  6. (S) A representative from Mossad said Tehran understands that by reacting positively to engagement, Iran can continue to "play for time" and avoid sanctions while pursuing its strategic objective to obtain a military nuclear capability. From Mossad's perspective, there is no reason to believe Iran will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 2010-2011, Iran will have the technological capability to build a nuclear weapon -- essentially reducing the question of weaponizing to a political decision.  Mossad said Iran's main crisis is in the political sphere -- the current regime is weaker than prior to the elections, but does not face significant risk as its security apparatus remains loyal, while the opposition lacks a charismatic leader.  The goal of the regime, therefore, is to calm down the domestic political environment -- Khamenei realizes the frustration demonstrated following the elections has not disappeared.  BG Smith asked if Khamenei's death might change the political landscape; Mossad noted no information to suggest a change in Khamenei's health, while those surrounding him appear more loyal than ever.  7. (S) Mossad believes Iran wants to become a regional hegemon, and is dictating its agenda by using Hamas and Hizballah as force multipliers.  In that respect, Iran is very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to its proxies.  Mossad said Tehran also understands the effort to split Syria from Iran's influence, and is working hard to deepen its relationship with Syria as a result.  DASD Kahl argued that Iran is weaker regionally today than in recent years.  He noted progress in Iraq, the results of the recent Lebanese elections, and outreach to Syria as signs of a weaker Iran.  DASD Kahl also noted increased U.S. credibility in the Muslim world, while the crackdown following the Iranian elections exposed the current regime as brutal to the region and in Europe.  Hizballah/Lebanon/Syria -----------------------  8. (S) Gilad addressed threats posed by "Hizballahstan" and "Hamastan," noting that Hizballah/Hamas-Syria-Iran cooperation has strengthened.  He noted that rockets from Lebanon can now cover the entire territory of Israel, while ballistic missiles -- although not new -- remain Israel's most serious threat with adversaries having the capability to target Israeli citizens and major cities. IDF J5 Col Shimon Arad noted four main trends in Lebanon: 1) internal political deadlock since the elections; 2) Hizballah's growing military capabilities; 3) Lebanon as a volatile military arena; and 4) Lebanon's susceptibility to outside influences, including Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.  He recommended improved US.-Israel coordination, and called for an exchange of views.  Arad also recommended creating Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) deconfliction measures, demanding improved LAF performance, and exerting greater pressure on Syria and smuggling. Finally, he called for sanctions on the Iranian Republican Guard Corps (IRGC), trilateral meetings with the Lebanese and UNIFIL to deter Hizballah, and bolstering UNIFIL by extending Gen. Graziano's tour for an additional six months.  9. (S) A/S Shapiro acknowledged the GOI's desire for specifics regarding U.S. policy on Lebanon, and hoped to invite GOI representatives to Washington in the near future for a full brief led by NEA, with PM participation and support.  He cited the need to provide an alternative to Hizballah, which explains U.S. goals to strengthen the LAF as a counterweight.  DASD Kahl argued that any LAF cooperation  TEL AVIV 00002502  003 OF 004   with Hizballah is pragmatic given the LAF's current weakness.  He noted that U.S. assistance has been temporarily put on hold since there is still no Lebanese government.  Kahl also argued that prospects for better relations with Damascus depend on Syrian desires for better relations with the United States and the return of the Golan Heights.  Arad argued that more must be done to weaken radicals and cease smuggling. Gilad said the GOI cannot envision a government in Lebanon without Hizballah, and said the LAF will come to the defense of Hizballah if attacked by Israel -- thus, a strengthened LAF hurts Israel.  QME ---  10. (S) Turning to U.S. regional arms transfers, Gilad suggested Qualitative Military Edge (QME) as a "codename" for potential threats against Israel.  Israel currently enjoys peace with regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates -- but the future is uncertain, and each of these regimes faces the potential for change, he argued. U.S. weapons -- "the best in the world" -- level the playing field by reducing the need for training -- and could ultimately aid a future enemy of Israel, Gilad said.  A/S Shapiro stressed the importance of transparency -- while there may be differences between Israel and the United States in terms of a regional assessment, the key is to ensure that there are no surprises, he said.  Peace Process -------------  11. (S) Gilad described the Middle East peace process as a "pillar" of Israeli security.  He quoted PM Netanyahu and President Peres that Israel remains sincerely committed to peace.  Gilad noted however, that the re-launching of negotiations is complicated by the split in Palestinian leadership.  He said a weak and corrupt PA had lost Gaza despite Israeli warnings.  Gilad said 2010 will prove pivotal with Palestinian elections looming and Egyptian mediation efforts to broker reconciliation between Hamas and the PA having failed.  That said, he noted that Israeli-PA security and economic cooperation in the West Bank continues to improve as Jenin and Nablus flourish, and described Palestinian security forces as the "good guys."  NEA/IPA Director Tom Goldberger said Special Envoy Sen. Mitchell continues his mission, and noted that Egyptian reconciliation efforts were meant to strengthen the PA, not weaken it.  Goldstone Report ----------------  12. (S) Gilad addressed Israel's immediate neighbors within the context of the Goldstone Report.  He said Israel has checked "all the details" of the report, and have concluded that the report's accusations are "baseless."  Buchris said the report sets a bad precedent for countries trying to protect its citizens from terrorists; he noted 300,000 phone calls from the IDF to houses in Gaza ahead of strikes in the effort to prevent civilian casualties -- "no other country has taken such steps," Buchris argued.  A/S Shapiro highlighted strong U.S. opposition to the report's referral to the UN Security Council, noting the report's biased mandate.  13. (S) Gilad said Israel only entered Gaza after Hamas violated the ceasefire or "tahdiya," which many Israelis felt was "humiliating" and left Defense Minister Barak open to criticism.  Gilad characterized Operation Cast Lead as a success that accounted for humanitarian issues; the IDF showed restraint in the operation because Israel did not want to re-occupy Gaza.  DASD Kahl advocated sharing perspectives and lessons learned on strategic communication to more effectively confront terrorists in civilian-populated areas. NSC Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Prem Kumar noted continued UNSC interest in the Goldstone Report, and asked Israel to inform the United States on any additional efforts or investigations the GOI was taking to help deflect any further damage from the report.  Egypt/Counter-Smuggling -----------------------  14. (S) Gilad said Israel was frustrated by its Arab neighbors -- including specifically Egypt -- for supporting the Goldstone Report, which complicates the peace process. Israel continues to benefit from good security cooperation with Jordan, he said.  Gilad argued that Egypt could stop smuggling into Gaza "completely," and questioned whether Egypt should be judged by its efforts or results.  Gilad  TEL AVIV 00002502  004 OF 004   stressed the latter, and argued Egypt can do more on counter-smuggling.  Finally, he noted Israeli concerns that Egypt continues to prepare for a potential future military confrontation with Israel, while no Egyptian military officers visit Israel.  15. (S) A/S Shapiro outlined U.S. military assistance to strengthen Egyptian border security, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and civil defense efforts.  He said the United States is working with Egypt to improve regional security efforts, such as counter-smuggling.  Regarding the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, A/S Shapiro stressed efforts to improve energy security and counter-terrorism, while bolstering the capabilities of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the face of the Iranian threat.  Finally, he noted U.S. withdrawal from the Anatolian Eagle exercise following the Turkish decision to suspend the IDF's participation.  A/S Shapiro said the United States has been delivering the message that Turkey must improve its relationship with Israel.  16. (S) PM Counter-Piracy Coordinator Maggi briefed on the counter smuggling technical discussion meeting (septel).  He cited the importance of working with Israel's neighbors -- including especially Egypt and Turkey -- to prevent Iranian weapons from entering Gaza.  Maggi said more pressure should be applied in the EU and UN to gain more latitude -- and possibly further action from the EU.  He said tracking cash flows, and increasing prosecutions and incarcerations were important, with the ultimate goal of increasing cooperation and momentum.  Goldberger said Egypt sees Hamas as a national security threat, and added that Egypt had closed 200 tunnels since the beginning of 2009.  17. (S) Goldberger noted Egyptian domestic political sensitivities, and questioned whether more commercial and humanitarian goods could be allowed through the Gaza border crossings.  Gilad strongly stated that there were no limits on commercial goods through the border crossings.  Goldberger asked about construction materiel like cement; Gilad said the GOI would not allow Hamas to build bunkers -- goods such as cement or iron would not be allowed because of their military applications.  He also argued that smuggling is a lucrative business for all involved, including the Egyptian government, and said the best way to stop the smuggling was to increase arrests and incarcerations.  Goldberger mentioned U.S. economic and development assistance efforts in Sinai.  He noted that most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on Israeli intelligence; additional information/intelligence from the GOI would ensure greater cooperation.  Bar raised prosecuting shipping companies complicit in arms transfers to Gaza; A/S Shapiro said he would take that back to Washington for further consideration.  Iraq/Yemen ----------  18. (S) On Iraq, DASD Kahl noted there are currently 125,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq, which will be reduced to 50,000 soldiers by September 1, 2010 with complete U.S. troop withdrawal by the end of 2011.  He noted the U.S. goal of establishing a long-term strategic relationship with a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq.  A/S Shapiro and DASD Kahl briefed the GOI on U.S. efforts to assist the Iraqi military to complete its counterinsurgency force, transition the military to a force that can defend its borders, and align the Iraqi military more closely to the United States.  19. (S) DASD Kahl pointed to the growing threat (al Qaida, al Houthi insurgency, and southern secessionists) in Yemen.  He said the United States is attempting to prevent Yemen from heading toward an "Afghanistan-type scenario" with general lawlessness and increased ungoverned spaces.  BG Smith noted that al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) continues to fester in North and sub-Saharan Africa.  He said Egypt is actively involved in countering AQIM with 3,800 soldiers in Sudan -- this should be encouraged and expanded.  20. (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared on this cable.   CUNNINGHAM
S E C R E T TEL AVIV 002757  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/22/2019 TAGS: PREL PARM MNUC KNNP EG IRSUBJECT: U/S TAUSCHER'S DECEMBER 1-2 VISIT TO ISRAEL  Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)  1. (S) Summary:  Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Ellen Tauscher visited Israel December 1-2.  U/S Tauscher focused her visit on setting the stage for a successful Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference (RevCon) in May 2010.  She consulted with GOI interlocutors on potential strategy in addressing Egyptian insistence on pushing for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, as a way to divert attention from Iran to Israel.  U/S Tauscher reiterated that the United States will not take any action to compromise Israel's security and would consult closely with Israel -- which GOI officials greatly appreciated. Nevertheless, U/S Tauscher said the United States is interested in exploring possible small steps involving Israel to address some of Egypt's NWFZ concerns regarding the lack of implementation of the 1995 resolution.  GOI officials for the most part were critical of these tactics, questioning why Israel should be portrayed as part of the problem.  They recommended a more direct approach to President Mubarak -- thereby circumventing the Egyptian MFA -- in which Egypt is reminded that Iran is the regional nuclear threat.  Other topics discussed include President Obama's arms control and nonproliferation agenda, the P5 1 process and Iran's nuclear program, the FMCT and CTBT, Jordan's plans for a nuclear reactor, and Israel's qualitative military edge (QME).  End summary.  2. (SBU) U/S Tauscher met with National Security Advisor Uzi Arad on December 1.  Arad was accompanied by NSC Senior Advisor and Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa Gil Reich.  In a separate meeting on December 1, U/S Tauscher met with MFA Director General Yossi Gal, Deputy Director General for North America Baruch Bina, and Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar.  U.S. participants for the Arad and Gal meetings included Political Counselor Marc Sievers, T Senior Advisor James Timbie, NSC's Adam Scheinman, and political military officer Jason Grubb.  U/S Tauscher met for dinner with Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) and MFA senior officials on December 1, including IAEC Director General Saul Chorev, Deputy Director General David Danieli, and Director for Policy and Arms Control Merav Zefary-Odiz, as well as MFA DDG Bar and Director for Arms Control Rodica Radian-Gordon.  On December 2, U/S Tauscher met for breakfast with MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad; U.S. attendees included Charge D'Affaires Luis Moreno, Timbie, Scheinman, and Grubb.  Arms Control/Nonproliferation Agenda ------------------------------------  3. (S) In various meetings with GOI interlocutors, U/S Tauscher outlined an ambitious arms control and nonproliferation agenda, beginning with the President's Prague speech, and including other priorities such as a follow-on to START, CTBT ratification, the upcoming NPT Review Conference, and negotiating the FMCT.  She noted that negotiations with Moscow on START were slow to develop in part due to delayed confirmations and Russian wariness.  But U/S Tauscher expected a START follow-on -- including a strong verification regime -- soon.  4. (S) National Security Advisor Arad described President Obama's arms control and nonproliferation agenda as "daunting and challenging."  He reaffirmed that the GOI will participate in the April 2010 Nuclear Security summit in Washington, noting that PM Netanyahu planned to attend the summit as discussed between President Obama and PM Netanyahu during their recent one-on-one meeting in Washington.  GOI Nuclear Summit Sherpa Gil Reich noted, however, that the Holocaust memorial day in Israel might be a potential scheduling conflict with the summit.  Arad expressed appreciation for the summit, noting that if the initiative had been pursued ten years previously, perhaps proliferation cases such as AQ Khan might have been prevented or at least controlled.  He wished the United States success negotiating with the Russians on START.  5. (S) Due to the U.S. administration's prioritization of arms control and nonproliferation, Arad also noted that the GOI had recently reconvened a high level committee on these issues comprised of GOI officials and experts from outside the government.  He noted that the committee had been formed during President George Herbert Walker Bush's administration to analyze treaties such as the CWC and CTBT, but stopped meeting in 2007.  U/S Tauscher expressed interest in meeting with the group during her next visit to Israel; Arad took the request on board.  Egypt and the NPT -----------------  6. (S) On the NPT, U/S Tauscher reiterated the importance of a successful Review Conference -- including hopefully a consensus resolution.  She raised U.S. concerns over potential Egyptian actions at the RevCon, based on previous decades of behavior and "10-15 year-old talking points."  U/S Tauscher said the United States is not "naive" with respect to Egypt; nevertheless, the United States must make a sincere, good faith effort to create the conditions for a positive RevCon -- this might include small steps with Israel to address some of Egypt's desire to demonstrate progress in implementation of the 1995 resolution on a region free of weapons of mass destruction.  7. (S) That said, U/S Tauscher reiterated that the United States would consult and coordinate with Israel, and would take no action that might compromise Israel's security.  She noted that the United States would like to elevate the NPT RevCon issue to President Mubarak at an appropriate time, and expressed interest in developing an alternate communication track to Mubarak to circumvent the MFA, potentially through Egyptian Intelligence Minister LTG Suleiman.  U/S Tauscher said her message to Cairo will be "very tough," and that Egyptian obstructionist behavior linking Israel to Iran's nuclear program is not helping Egypt.  8. (S) Arad said relations with Egypt were "relatively good," describing continued dialogue between PM Netanyahu and President Mubarak, and strong channels of communication at other levels.  In many respects, he said Israel's relations with Egypt are almost as good as during PM Rabin's time. Arad said Egypt and Israel do not see "eye-to-eye" on some issues such as Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, but otherwise relations are strong.  9. (S) Arad described the Egyptian MFA, however, as a "nagging problem" in the relationship, particularly regarding the Middle East NWFZ issue, and noted Cairo's refusal to talk to FM Lieberman.  Other GOI officials expressed exasperation over Egyptian motivations on the NWFZ; Reich raised Egyptian behavior at the latest IAEA General Conference, as well as Cairo's negative reaction to the IAEA Board of Governor's recent statement on Iran.  Arad said Israel has supported a regional NWFZ as far back as 1992, provided Israel enjoyed peaceful relations with its neighbors.  He said the GOI has spoken frankly with Cairo, noting that such behavior is not helpful, and is misdirecting focus away from Iran.  10. (S) MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad said Egypt understands that Iran is the real threat to the region, noting that a nuclear weapon-armed Iran is a redline for Cairo.  He averred that Egypt does not accept that Iran will become a superpower, but remains afraid of its own domestic political situation post-Mubarak.  Gilad expressed succession concerns, noting that Mubarak is "approaching the past more quickly than the future."  He added that Mubarak does not have confidence in Egyptian Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit.  11. (S) MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar outlined repeated attempts by the GOI to engage with the Egyptian MFA, but to no avail. He described Egyptian actions linking Israel to Iran's nuclear program in the IAEA as "not encouraging," and questioned how to convince Egypt to drop this "obsession" over the NWFZ.  Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) Director General Saul Chorev and Arms Control Director Merav Zefary-Odiz speculated that Egypt feels challenged by Iranian attempts to acquire nuclear weapons, and includes Israel in any public attack on Tehran in order to give Cairo coverage from regional criticism.  Bar argued that the Egyptian MFA raises Israel's nuclear program as a "wedge issue" in order to prevent better relations between Israel and others in the region.  IAEC Deputy Director General David Danieli concurred, noting that Egypt can use the nuclear issue to put Israel "in a corner" while benefiting from positive relations between the two countries.   12. (S) Zefary-Odiz also reviewed her participation in an International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament conference in September 2009 in Cairo.  She described the conference as "very confrontational," and that it was clear Israel was targeted by Egyptian interlocutors. Zefary-Odiz acknowledged that the GOI had anticipated such behavior, and contemplated skipping the conference.  She noted that Egyptian officials also lambasted Iranian participants, but were always careful to include Israel and Iran in the same sentence.  13. (S) Arad said the GOI will take their cue from U.S. "heavy-lifting": if there is a small step -- "not a concession," he stressed -- that Israel could take to help facilitate, then the GOI would consider it.  He noted that the GOI wanted to see a "reversal of trends" from Egypt regarding Iran's nuclear program -- after all, it is in Egypt's interest to do so.  He said Israel continues to have reservations regarding the NPT -- following nuclear pursuits by Libya, Syria, and Iran, it is clear to the GOI that the NPT is not sufficient and must be strengthened.  The goal of the NPT, he stressed, should not be to "prevent the next Iran, but to stop Iran in order to prevent the next Iran" from occurring.  14. (S) Chorev speculated that Egypt will aim to ruin the RevCon.  Bar said the Egyptians have not been held accountable for past bad behavior at the NPT RevCon -- "they have never paid the price."  He noted that Cairo knows the importance the United States attaches to a successful RevCon, and therefore will try to leverage a "high price" in order not to ruin it.  He noted similar tactics with regard to Egypt's counter-smuggling efforts along the border with Gaza.   15. (S) Timbie outlined several small steps that might address Egyptian concerns and demonstrate progress in implementation of the 1995 resolution and the Middle East NWFZ: an IAEA forum on the experience of other regional NWFZs; a special coordinator or rappateur on 1995 resolution implementation; a statement from the United States, United Kingdom and Russia reiterating the importance of the 1995 resolution; and exploring text with Israel and Egypt on universality and compliance.  16. (S) Gilad questioned these steps from a "tactical/strategic" context, and suggested this was not a tactical matter.  He argued against creating the impression that Israel was the problem.  Instead, Gilad recommended a strategic, traditional approach -- concessions will only be used by Egypt as leverage.  He suggested the United States remind Egypt of its special relationship based on U.S. support, and reaffirm that Iran is the "bad guy."  Gilad said Egypt should also be reminded that most countries in the region agree with the NWFZ concept in principle; the Egyptian MFA's insistence on an immediate NWFZ neither fits the current political reality nor makes sense as it diverts focus from Iranian intransigence.  He noted that Egypt listens to the United States; it is therefore important to speak clearly and directly when taking the issue to Mubarak.  17. (S) Chorev and Zefary-Odiz argued these steps had been tried in the past -- and had failed.  Danieli questioned why Israel should take any steps at all.  Based on experience at the IAEA and the UN First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, he said "nothing satisfies Egypt" as Cairo "pockets every concession" and demands more -- "it's a slippery slope."  Danieli said Israel will not "play by Egypt's rules."  Bar concurred, noting that Egypt will "raise the bar," and begin negotiations with these small steps as the baseline -- he was skeptical such steps would prove helpful.  18. (S) Arad characterized these steps as "talking endlessly" -- that is "not progress," he said.  He was uncomfortable discussing Israel NPT compliance, especially as Israel is not a party to the treaty.  He also raised concerns regarding the definition of the Middle East NWFZ -- did it also include Pakistan, India and Iran, for example?  Arad said such questions should be posed to Cairo -- if Egypt is willing to include Pakistan in its definition of a Middle East NWFZ, then we can take that as a signal that Cairo is ready for a serious conversation on the matter.  19. (S) Zefary-Odiz argued that the NPT as a "global solution" is not appropriate in the current political realities of the Middle East.  Due to the region's prior track record of NPT non-compliance, she said a gradual, step-by-step process employing confidence building measures be used to improve relations between neighbors.  NPT partner obligations should be enhanced, not reduced, she said. Zefary-Odiz noted that only after peaceful relations are established can arms control measures be pursued, starting with conventional weapons and later focusing on chemical/biological/nuclear arms.  She said that Egypt and other Arab states de-link comprehensive peace from arms control measures -- Israel views these elements as inseparable and sequential.  20. (S) On a related note, Chorev asked if Israel should attend the RevCon as an observer.  U/S Tauscher and Timbie replied that the decision was ultimately the GOI's to make, but offered to raise the issue in Washington .  Chorev noted that Israel would be careful not to "make any noise," and could play a positive, consultative role.  On the other hand, Danieli acknowledged the argument that as a non-party, perhaps it was not appropriate for Israel to attend.  Iran ----  21. (S) U/S Tauscher said the United States was very concerned about the recently announced Iranian plans to build ten additional uranium enrichment facilities.  She reiterated the two track strategy of persuasion and pressure, and noted that the time for persuasion is "waning."  U/S Tauscher said the United States has "created the coalition" it had hoped for, and was happy to see the recent IAEA BOG's resolution transferred to the UNSC.  22. (S) U/S Tauscher noted that the United States was working hard through the P5 1 process to encourage Russian and Chinese cooperation to counter continued Iranian intransigence and inflammatory rhetoric -- Russia and China are "lynch pins," she said.  She noted that Russia had worked closely with the United States on the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal, which Moscow considered an "elegant solution," -- but Iran had not agreed.  Keeping Russia engaged, U/S Tauscher explained, also means Chinese cooperation.  23. (S) MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad described recent Russian cooperation on Iran as encouraging, but expressed reservations that Russia would join in any sanctions against Iran.  He explained that Moscow has raised the provision of sophisticated Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology in exchange for canceling the S-300 sale to Tehran.  Gilad said that Russian interlocutors had acknowledged development gaps in their UAV platform, and is prepared to pay USD one billion for Israeli UAV technology. He reiterated that Israel will not provide its latest UAV technology, arguing that such technology would likely end up in the hands of the Chinese.  24. (S) Arad said the GOI appreciated the United States' efforts regarding Iran, noting how hard the United States has worked to build an alliance.  He pointed to the recent IAEA Board of Governor's resolution as a successful example of U.S. efforts.  Regarding the Qom facility, Arad said the GOI was not surprised by Tehran's "chutzpah."  He described a high degree of alertness in Israel, and added that the GOI studies daily Iranian posturing and boastful announcements in an attempt to discern Iranian intentions.  Arad commented that the trends are bad, as Iran continues to accumulate low enriched uranium.  25. (S) MFA DG Gal said there was not much difference in the national intelligence estimations (U.S., UK, France, and Russia) regarding Iran.  He said the GOI takes "very seriously" Iranian plans for ten new enrichment facilities -- "time is of the essence," and "now is the time to implement crippling sanctions," he added.  Gal likened the case for enhanced sanctions to prescribed antibiotics from a doctor -- one must take the full course of antibiotics for the prescribed period of time, or they will not work.  26. (S) Turning to his crystal ball, Gilad was not sure Tehran had decided it wants a nuclear weapon -- but is "determined" to obtain the option to build one.  He acknowledged that the engagement strategy is a good idea -- "as long as you understand that it will not work."  Gilad said it should be clear by February 2010 that engagement as a option has failed -- the imposition of "crippling sanctions" for the February/March/April timeframe is crucial.  He said Russian cooperation will be the key, and the current Russian cooperative mind-set cannot necessarily be counted on in several weeks time.  By June of next year, Gilad said it should be clear whether sanctions have worked.  However, given Tehran's clandestine nuclear program (e.g., Qom), he said it will not be clear when Iran has reached the "point of no return" -- he doubted Iran will choose to let it overtly known that it has produced a nuclear weapon.  FMCT and CTBT -------------  27. (S) IAEC DG Chorev raised the FMCT's future in the Conference on Disarmament.  U/S Tauscher acknowledged frustration with Pakistan, and noted that while Washington places a high priority on the FMCT, other efforts like a START follow-on and the CTBT will come first.  Timbie added that it will take some time to negotiate an FMCT.  28. (S) Chorev asked about the current prospects for CTBT ratification in the Senate.  U/S Tauscher noted that the START follow-on was a higher priority, and said the Senate will likely focus on the Law of the Sea treaty before turning its attention to the CTBT.  She pointed to mid-term Congressional elections in 2010, and explained that focusing on the CTBT in 2011 might be more prudent given the controversy associated with the treaty.  U/S Tauscher explained the necessity of making the case for the CTBT, and hoped to build political momentum in favor of the treaty through the release of the Nuclear Posture Review, a new national intelligence estimate, and the handover on the stockpile stewardship program.  29. (S) Chorev asked that the United States consult with the GOI on the CTBT, where he said Israel could be "more flexible than the FMCT."  U/S Tauscher asked if the GOI might be willing to make affirmative statements in support of the CTBT; Chorev made no promises, but suspected such a statement might be possible -- especially if it would help with Senate ratification.  30. (S) Chorev described the FMCT as "very difficult" for Israel.  Scheinman confirmed that negotiations would be based on the 2006 draft FMCT text, with an added verification regime that is being worked on -- he described the verification regime's definitions as "critical" in that regard.  Danieli questioned the FMCT's added value, arguing that it would have little impact.  He asked who was the FMCT's real target -- India, Pakistan or even Israel?  Jordanian Nuclear Reactor -------------------------  31. (S) IAEC DG Chorev raised Jordanian plans to build a nuclear reactor.  He said the GOI has decided not to oppose the reactor, and have offered the Jordanians Israeli expertise on where best to build it.  Chorev said the IAEC formed a steering committee with its Jordanian counterpart comprised of three working groups focusing on safety, geological surveys, and water issues.  Chorev said the steering committee first met in Amman in June 2009, and is waiting to convene again.  Danieli stressed that the GOI does not want to hamper the Jordanian nuclear plans, but added that Israel has concerns about border issues and security associated with the reactor.  Timbie said the United States is pushing Jordan to sign a 123 Agreement along the same lines as the recent agreement signed with UAE, only stronger.  Zefary-Odiz noted that Egypt is putting tremendous pressure on Jordan not to accept a 123 Agreement.  QME ---  32. (S) U/S Tauscher reiterated the United States' strong commitment to Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME), and expressed appreciation for the GOI's willingness to work with us through the newly created QME working groups.  Both MOD Pol-Mil Chief Gilad and MFA DDG Bar commended the newly created QME working groups, and asked they be scheduled to convene as soon as possible.  33. (U) T has cleared this cable.  CUNNINGHAM
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 002777  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/23/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV KNNP MASS SY TU FR KWBG IR ISSUBJECT: CODEL SKELTON'S MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU  Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (C) Summary.  CODEL Skelton met with Prime Minister Netanyahu November 16 at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem.  Their discussion covered Netanyahu's meeting with President Obama the previous week, Netanyahu's interest in resuming negotiations with the Palestinians, the Iranian nuclear program and options for tougher sanctions, possible negotiations with Syria, U.S.-Israeli cooperation on missile defense, and Israel's objections to the Goldstone Report. Netanyahu said his meeting with the President was the best meeting that they have had.  He stressed that he had told the President that he is ready to negotiate with Abu Mazen now, and contrasted Israel's position with the PA's setting of preconditions for negotiations.  Netanyahu listed steps the GOI has taken to support Abu Mazen, noting that the PA is "doing a good job" on security.  A nuclear Iran, however, would "wash away" all progress as well as undermining Israel's peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan.  Netanyahu said that Iran is vulnerable to sanctions and urged the U.S. to increase the pressure on Iran, with likeminded countries if Russia and China will not support new sanctions in the Security Council.  Netanyahu commented that there is broader Arab and European support for tough sanctions than in the past, although the Arabs may not say so publicly.  Netanyahu praised President Obama's commitment to missile defense, and commented that U.S.-Israeli cooperation on missile defense sends a strong signal to Israel's enemies.  He thanked the CODEL for the Congress' support.  Netanyahu said Israel faces three main threats:  Iran's nuclear program, the build-up of rockets and missiles in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and the Goldstone Report, which condemned Israel for defending its civilian population from years of rocket attacks.  Netanyahu said Israel will need to ensure that a future Palestinian state cannot launch rockets at Israel's international airport or critical facilities.  End Summary.  Let's Get on with Negotiations ------------------------------  2.  (U) CODEL Skelton, consisting of House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton (D, MO) and Mrs. Skelton, Representative Steve Israel (D-NY), Representative Tim Murphy (R, PA), Congressional Staff members Phil McNaughton, Michael Casey, and John Wason, Military aides Colonel Jeff Koch and PolCouns met with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu November 16.  Netanyahu was joined by Deputy National Security Adviser Rear Admiral (reserve) Avriel Bar Josef, media adviser Mark Regev, policy adviser Ari Harrow, and a Congressional liaison officer from the Israeli Embassy in Washington.  3.  (C) Netanyahu began the meeting by noting his appreciation for his meeting with President Obama at the White House the previous week.  Netanyahu described his conversation with the President as "the best we've had so far."  He said that regarding negotiations with the Palestinians, he told the President, "let's get on with it." Netanyahu stated that his government had removed hundreds of obstacles and roadblocks in the West Bank, helping the West Bank economy achieve a seven percent growth rate, adding "and we can kick it up to ten percent growth."  Netanyahu said his Bar Ilan address last June had been difficult for him, but it had united Israelis in support of accepting a demilitarized Palestinian state.  The current GOI had also restrainted construction in settlements more than its past several predecessors.  4.  (C) Netanyahu then contrasted his efforts with the PA, which he said is maintaining a "political and economic boycott" of Israel, setting preconditions for negotiations, supporting the Goldstone Report in the UN, and is now talking about a unilateral declaration of independence.  Israel wants to engage, but the Palestinians do not.  Netanyahu quoted a Palestinian official as saying that the PA had "exhausted the negotiating process," then noted that the Palestinians have not even started to talk to his government.  The real difference, he pointed out, is that Abu Mazen is facing elections, while Israel has already conducted its elections. Netanyahu also commented that the Palestinians had initially expected the U.S. to "deliver Israel" on all of their demands, but are now realizing that this will not happen. President Obama understands, he stated, that Israel is ready to move forward.  The alternatives to negotiations are bad for everyone.  Netanyahu said that if Abu Mazen would engage, they would confront all the issues.  The process would not be easy, but it has to get started.  5.  (C) Netanyahu said the West Bank had remained quiet during Operation Cast Lead because the Palestinians do not  TEL AVIV 00002777  002 OF 003   want to live under Hamas' rule.  He asserted that according to recent polls, Abu Mazen and Fatah would easily win an election, even in Gaza.  Netanyahu stressed that he was not pushing for the Palestinians to hold elections, but was instead focused on promoting the expansion of the West Bank economy by removing both physical and bureaucratic obstacles.  He acknowledged that the PA is "doing a good job" on security, though he added that PA leaders are not aware of everything Israel is doing to support the PA's security.  If we could add a political process to the cooperation that currently exists, we could get security, economic development, and peace.  Netanyahu warned, however, that if Iran gets a nuclear bomb, the peace process would be "washed away."  Even Israel's peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan would come under enormous pressure.  Iran Sanctions --------------  6.  (C) Chairman Skelton noted that his Committee is following Iran closely.  Netanyahu said he had advised the President to stick to the deadline on the TRR offer, adding that it is also important to ask Iran to stop its enrichment activities.  Netanyahu commented that there is a new mood in the major European capitals in support of sanctions.  The U.S. does not need to depend on the Security Council, but can work with likeminded countries.  Sanctions should focus on Iran's importation of gasoline, while also focusing on opening up the information networks.  The U.S. should lead the world toward tougher sanctions, or more of the Arab states will start appeasing Iran, as Qatar is doing. Netanyahu summed up his advice as:  "stick to the deadline, be firm on the terms, and apply sanctions" if Iran does not comply.  He thought Russia may be more inclined than in the past, but it would be best not to count on the Security Council.  Having set a deadline, the P5 1 should stick to it.  The Western powers at least will go along.  We should close the gap between understanding the problem and acting on it, he said.  Netanyahu said Israel's problems with Iran are not limited to its nuclear program.  Even without a nuclear umbrella, Iran is sending hundreds of tons of weapons to Syria, Hamas and Hizballah.  The ship seized November 3 by the Israeli Navy had on board two thirds of the amount of rockets fired at Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War.  7.  (C) Representative Israel asked Netanyahu about the timetable for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon.  Netanyahu responded that Iran has the capability now to make one bomb or they could wait and make several bombs in a year or two. It is important to bear in mind that the Iranian regime was exposed as a fraud during their presidential elections.  The Iranian people detest the regime and have shown great courage in the streets.  The exposure of the Qom facility also helped convince doubters in the international community that Iran has a weapons program.  Iran has a weak economy and a fractured political system, so it is vulnerable to sanctions.  The time to act diplomatically is now, Netanyahu     said, adding that we still have a year or two to stop the Iranian program.  Netanyahu said he thought President Obama understands Iran perfectly.  The Arab leaders hope Iran will be stopped, there is broad Arab and European support for "vigorous steps."  Chairman Skelton asked whether the Arabs would state their support publicly.  Netanyahu replied they might not, but it would not make a large difference since the Arab "street" will not rise up in support of the Iranian regime.  Ready to Talk to Syria ----------------------  8.  (C) Regarding Syria, Netanyahu urged the U.S. to press Damascus to stop supplying arms to Hizballah.  Noting that he had stopped in Paris to meet President Sarkozy on his way back to Israel from Washington, Netanyahu confirmed media reports that Sarkozy had offered to mediate between Israel and Syria.  Netanyahu said he would prefer direct negotiations with the Syrians, but added that he would accept France as a mediator.  President Asad, however, still wants Turkey as the mediator.  Noting that Turkish PM Erdogan had recently stated that he would prefer to meet with Sudanese President Omar Bashir than with Netanyahu, Netanyahu asked how the Turks could be fair mediators.  Working Together on Missile Defense -----------------------------------  9.  (C) Netanyahu said that in addition to peace with the Palestinians and Iran, he and the President had discussed joint U.S.-Israeli efforts on missile defense.  Netanyahu  TEL AVIV 00002777  003 OF 003   commented that he had personally visited the Juniper Cobra joint military exercise.  The program has reached a phase at which it is possible to monitor incoming missiles with a good lead-time, but it is still very expensive to intercept "crude rockets" such as those fired from Gaza.  The information shield is moving ahead nicely, but the physical shield is lagging behind.  Netanyahu observed that it is very important for the U.S. and its allies to be able to defend themselves against missile attack.  Chairman Skelton noted that U.S. personnel who briefed the CODEL were very optimistic about the program.  Netanyahu said only the U.S. and Israel are currently working on missile defense.  This cooperation sends a powerful message to Israel's enemies he noted, and thanked the CODEL and the Congress for their support.  Goldstone Report a Key Threat -----------------------------  10.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Israel currently faces three principal threats:  Iran's nuclear program, missile proliferation and the Goldstone Report.  Goldstone gave terrorists immunity to attack Israel if they fire from populated areas.  During Cast Lead the IDF send thousands and flyers, text messages and phone calls to civilians, warning them to get out of the way, yet Israel was accused of war crimes.  Hamas and other terrorists fired 12.000 rockets into Israel from Gaza, Netanyahu said, noting that Israel is the only country in the world faced with threats to annihilate it.  Netanyahu asked the CODEL to imagine a situation in which Israeli Air Force pilots must consult with lawyers before they can travel abroad.  Former PM Olmert, former FonMin Livni and DefMin Barak could be hauled before the International Criminal Court.  Netanyahu said he could not accept that IDF soldiers could be charged with war crimes for protecting their country from constant attack.  The deaths of several hundred civilians in Gaza was "tragic," Netanyahu said, but there was no deliberate targeting of civilians by Israel.  Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime, but what should Israel do when terrorists deliberately target Israeli civilians and then hide within their civilian population?  11.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 000457  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/26/2019 TAGS: PREL PGOV KPAL IS IR SYSUBJECT: CODEL CARDIN DISCUSSES IRAN, SYRIA, PALESTINIANS, AND ISRAEL ELECTION WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (C)  SUMMARY  During their trip to Israel, CODEL Cardin discussed Iran, Syria, Israel-Palestinian negotiations, and the Israeli elections with Likud Party leader and candidate for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Netanyahu described a nuclear Iran as the greatest threat facing Israel, and urged strong economic sanctions backed by a viable military option to confront a problem that he said threatened the region and could prove a "tipping point" in world history.  Describing his approach to "economic peace" with the Palestinians, Netanyahu suggested he would cut through bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development to build a "pyramid" from the "bottom up" that would strengthen the Palestinian Authority, and offer the Palestinians  a viable alternative to radicalism.  Netanyahu expressed support for the concept of land swaps, and emphasized that he did not want to govern the West Bank and Gaza but rather to stop attacks from being launched from there.  Netanyahu suggested Syrian interest in peace negotiations with Israel were really overtures to the United States, and described the Syrians as firmly in the Iranian camp.  Netanyahu expressed confidence that President Peres would offer him rather than Kadima Party leader Livni the opportunity of forming a coalition because the bloc of center-right/right wing parties in the new Knesset amounted to 65 seats.  Netanyahu said his desire would be to form a unity government with Kadima, but would not agree to a rotating prime ministership.  END SUMMARY  2.  (SBU)  As part of their February 14-17 visit to Israel, CODEL Cardin met with Likud Party leader and candidate for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 16 in Jerusalem.  Netanyahu was at the center of intense political speculation about the formation of a governing coalition following the extremely close Israeli national election of February 10, which did not produce a clear winner.  The CODEL met with Netanyahu following meetings the previous day with President Peres, and prior to meetings later in the day with Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Fayyad.  ---- IRAN ----  3.  (C)  Netanyahu quickly launched into his oft-stated position that Iran is the greatest threat facing Israel. Noting that "Persia" already had two bases on the Mediterranean (referring to Hizballah and Hamas), Netanyahu complained that Iran's "tentacles" were choking Israel, and that a new one grew back whenever one was cut off.  Netanyahu charged that Iran was developing nuclear weapons with the express purpose of wiping out Israel, and described preventing Iran from developing a nuclear capability as Israel's  highest policy priority.  Netanyahu described five threats that he saw emanating from Iranian nuclear development: a direct threat to Israel; a direct threat to other regional states; increased terrorist power under an Iranian nuclear umbrella; a Middle East nuclear arms race; and a destabilized Middle East, with  Arab regimes "terrified" of Iran in his view.  Netanyahu, commenting that he normally avoided political jargon, pointed to one phrase that he said applied to this issue - "a tipping point." According to Netanyahu, if Iran develops a nuclear weapon capability it will "topple the peace process" and "change the history of the world."  4.  (C)  When asked what advice he offered to the United States, Netanyahu reported that he had spoken to then-candidate Obama and said the method was less important than the goal, and asked rhetorically whether the President would allow Iran to "cross the nuclear threshold ... on his watch."  Netanyahu suggested there were many ways to pressure Iran, which he saw as economically weak at the moment due to plunging oil prices at the same time that the U.S. President had strong international backing, a situation Netanyahu described as the opposite of the past few years.  He said he would look forward (as Prime Minister) to discussing  with President Obama concrete measures to be taken against Iran. Netanyahu said these would not be a substitute for Palestinian negotiations, but that any result from such negotiations would be "washed away" by Iran's attaining a nuclear bomb.  5.  (C)  When asked how Iran could be isolated, Netanyahu suggested a blockade as one possibility.  The nuclear program could be stopped if the U.S. led the international community to "ratchet up" economic sanctions, but that these sanctions would only work if Iran knew that the U.S. military option remained viable.  Netanyahu said he did not object to a U.S. dialogue with Iran provided the talks were close ended, perhaps two months, with fixed results, otherwise Iran would  TEL AVIV 00000457  002 OF 003   "take you to the cleaners."  He said he agreed with the Europeans' urging the U.S. to postpone any talks until past the Iranian elections in June.  Netanyahu said he did not know for certain how close Iran was to developing a nuclear weapons capability, but that "our experts" say Iran was probably only one or two years away and that was why they wanted open ended negotiations.  He again urged "tough negotiations" if military means were not used  (and added that Special Envoy Mitchell was both nice and tough.) Netanyahu described the Iranian regime as crazy, retrograde, and fanatical, with a Messianic desire to speed up a violent "end of days."  That was not the whole country, however, in his view, as he said that "75 percent of the Iranian people" oppose the regime, but that it governed with terror and would be hard to overthrow.  There was no single view from Iranians, therefore, but there was from the powers that dominate.  He reiterated that strong economic action could stop their nuclear development or possibly even bring down the regime - as could "the U.S. military process."  ----------------- PALESTINIAN TRACK -----------------  6.  (C)  Turning to peace with the Palestinians, Netanyahu said the reason  the process had not worked so far was that while 70 percent of Israelis were willing to make concessions, the same number were convinced that there was no real Palestinian partner.  Netanyahu warned that when Israel left Lebanon is created a first Iranian base, that when it left Gaza it created a second Iranian base, and if Israel "promised" a third retreat from the West Bank it would see the same results.  There were three options, according to Netanyahu - withdrawing to the 1967 borders (that would "get terror, not peace"); doing nothing ("just as bad"); or "rapidly building a pyramid from the ground up."  Netanyahu suggested a rapid move to develop the West Bank economically, including "unclogging" bureaucratic "bottlenecks."  He promised to "take charge personally" (as Prime Minister) to facilitate this bureaucratic reform, which would occur in tandem with political negotiations and cooperation with Jordan to build up Palestinian Authority security capacity. Netanyahu noted that there  were larger demonstrations against the  Gaza operation in Madrid and London than in the West Bank.  He said this was because the West Bankers recognized that Hamas represents  the prospect of "violent, crazy" people in charge of their society; they  should be offered real alternatives in order to have the strength to resist the radicals.  7.  (C)  Netanyahu said his "new approach"  would also include not continuing to fund a  "bloated" Palestinian bureaucracy.  It would be aimed at direct development. Netanyahu, noting that he had previously "turned around" the Israeli economy (as Finance Minister), gave one example of a problem he would fix as an electric powerline in the West Bank that was held up by conflicting and competing agencies. He said this powerline was needed and would create jobs, but was held up not because the Palestinians were targeted, but because that was how the Israeli bureaucracy worked for everyone, including Israelis.  When asked whether these reforms could include room to modify security arrangements, Netanyahu agreed that some of what the GOI calls security is in fact bureaucracy.  Pointing to what he described as strong but unpublicized trade between Haifa port and Iraq via Jordan, he suggested assembly points could be set up in the West Bank for some goods, which would create thousands of jobs.  This would not be a substitute for a political settlement, according to Netanyahu, but economic prosperity would make peace possible, as occurred in Northern Ireland.  ----- SYRIA -----  8.  (C)  Netanyahu said he was actually more optimistic about dealing with the Palestinians than with Syria, because he was confident that the Palestinian Authority wants Iran and its proxies out.  He said he was less sanguine about Syria, which he complained straddles the fence all the time.  The Syrians might "talk about" a new (U.S.) relationship, but he did not see them disconnecting from Iran.  Netanyahu suggested that Israel "giving up" the Golan would just result in assurances that Syria would later "tear up."  Describing King Hussein as heroic, and noting that the King came from his "death bed" in 1998 to get then-Prime Minister Netanyahu and then-Palestinian Authority Chairman Arafat to reach an agreement at the Wye River talks, Netanyahu said that when Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, even King Hussein "snuggled up" to the Iraqi leader out of necessity.  Such is the reality in the Middle East.   TEL AVIV 00000457  003 OF 003   ------------------- COALITION FORMATION -------------------  9.  (C)  Despite finishing one Knesset seat behind Kadima and its candidate Tzipi Livni in the February 10 Israeli national elections, Netanyahu expressed complete confidence that President Peres would offer him the opportunity to form a government because the bloc of center-right/right wing parties in the new Knesset has 65 seats compared to Livni's potential bloc of 45 seats for center-left/left wing parties plus 11 seats for Arab parties.  Netanyahu said his desire would be to form a unity government with Kadima, but would not agree to a rotating prime ministership with Ms. Livni. He explained that the one time Israel had a rotation came as a result of an exact tie between the two political coalitions, but this time the right wing bloc was much larger.  10.  (C) When asked about Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party, Netanyahu reminded the CODEL that Kadima had in fact included Lieberman in their government in its earlier stages.  Netanyahu stressed repeatedly that he preferred a unity government, and said the large security and economic problems facing Israel called for the strength that a unity government would offer.  Livni "collapsed" left- wing votes (from Labor and other parties) to score a one vote margin for Kadima over Likud in the elections, but took no votes away from the right, according to Netanyahu.  When asked what he might offer to Kadima, Netanyahu suggested Kadima would get a few key ministerial portfolios, but did not elaborate.  He said that he while he was convinced a rotating Prime Ministership would not happen, he was confident a unity government could.  Netanyahu said the government would not include the Arab parties.  11.  (C)  Netanyahu promised that as Prime Minister his government would not "go back" to unilateral withdrawals, and would have a clear focus.  On the economy, he said Israel was not a huge economy such as the United States or China, and that he would be able to turn things around quickly, as "a small share of a declining market" was big for Israel. Asked about settlements, Netanyahu noted that he had not established any new settlements when he was Prime Minister. Half of the West Bank, the area east of the ridge line and the Jordan Valley, is virtually unpopulated and only contains a few settlements.  In the other half, Israeli and Palestinian populations are intertwined.  Once the Palestinian Authority develops into a real partner it will be possible to negotiate an agreement over territory, settlements and "refined" Palestinian sovereignty without an army or control over air space and borders.  Netanyahu said it would be too hard to negotiate agreements over Jerusalem and refugees until the other issues are resolved.  Claiming that many Palestinians accept this point, Netanyahu said he was not talking about a delaying tactic but rather a temporary freeze, adding that he hoped PA Prime Minister Fayyad would still be around since Fayyad also thinks along economic lines.  12.  (SBU)  As an example of economic development, Netanyahu spoke about expanding faith tourism.  He said that it "defied imagination" that the well-known site on the Jordan River where John the Baptist baptized Jesus was "paralyzed" by a GOI/PA jurisdiction dispute.  With Jericho only a mile away, Netanyahu offered to give an "easy", secure "envelope" for transporting tourists from the Galilee to this part of the West Bank.  That would lead to "co-production" that would provide large revenue streams of tourist dollars to the Palestinians, from a population that was already coming to Israel.  He asked why Israelis would be  less disposed to make concessions to a viable Palestinian government and society.  Netanyahu agreed that West Bank checkpoints take too long, and offered to look into express lanes, increased staffing, and other possible solutions - as Prime Minister.   13.

Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)  1.  (S) Summary.  MFA Deputy Director General for the Middle East Yacov Hadas provided PolCouns March 16 with an overview of Israel's relations with several of the Gulf states.  Hadas described Israel's relations with the Gulf as a function of the Gulf Arabs' fear of Iran, but also as due to the Arabs' belief in Israeli influence in Washington.  Fleshing out some of the points he had made earlier to NEA Acting A/S Feltman (reftel), Hadas described Qatar's shift toward the radical camp in the region as a "game" linked to Qatari rivalry with Saudi Arabia.  Hadas believes Qatar is feeling pressure from Israel, Egypt and the Saudis, adding that he has been invited to visit Doha for talks about how to resume normal Qatari-Israeli ties.  Hadas noted that while the Omanis are generally correct in their dealings with Israel, they appear not to recognize the seriousness of the threat from Iran.  He said that while the UAE is increasingly hostile to Iran, it remains unclear how far they are willing to go in terms of increasing financial pressures on Tehran.  Hadas said the Gulf Arabs feel that the U.S. does not listen to them and therefore sometimes try to pass messages through Israel. While he agreed that progress on the Palestinian track would make it easier for the Gulf states to be open about their ties to Israel, he cautioned that the Gulf states use the peace process as an "excuse not to take action" against Iran or in support of the PA.  End Summary.  2.  (C) PolCouns called on Deputy Director General for the Middle East Yacov Hadas March 16 to follow up on Hadas' March 4 discussion with Acting A/S Feltman of Israeli-Gulf relations.  Beginning with Qatar, Hadas said there were signs that various pressures on the Qataris were starting to have an effect.  Hadas noted that Qatar could only get its humanitarian relief supplies into Gaza through Israel. Qatari diplomats assigned to their Gaza consulate also had to cross through Israel since Egypt would not allow them to enter Gaza from Rafah.  For now, the Israelis are not allowing either Qatari assistance or personnel to cross into Gaza.  Hadas noted that he had been invited to visit Doha to discuss reopening the Israeli trade office, which he saw as a positive sign.  He added that the Qataris needed to understand that they could not expect to restore cooperative relations with Israel without agreeing to reopen the trade office.  3.  (S) While Hadas was critical of the Qataris' treatment of Israel since the Gaza operation, he stressed that he thought Qatar's policies were not a matter of a shift in ideology toward the radical camp, but linked to their rivalry with the Saudis and, by extension, with Egypt.  In private settings, Hadas noted that the Qatari leadership harbored "no illusions" about Iran.  Prince Hamad had told the Israelis in October 2006 that he believed Iran was determined to develop a nuclear bomb no matter the cost.  According to Hadas, Hamad complained at the time that he felt the U.S. would not listen to him and tended to believe what it heard from Iran.  4.  (S) Hadas reiterated the point he had made to Feltman regarding Oman, calling the Omanis the "most problematic" of the Gulf states in terms of their view of Iran.  With regard to Omani contacts with Israel, Hadas said they were "correct," but the Omanis never fulfilled their commitment to open an Israeli office in Muscat.  He said Oman has "its own definition" of what poses a threat to the Gulf, partly due to Oman's geographical location.  He did not think Oman would be willing to join the rest of the GCC against Iran.  5.  (S) Hadas agreed that the UAE was increasingly hostile to Iran, but there remained a question as to how far they were prepared to go.  The UAE has extensive trade and financial relations with Iran, including money laundering, and it was unclear whether they were ready to use these relations as leverage.  Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdallah has developed good personal relations with Foreign Minister Livni, but the Emiratis are "not ready to do publicly what they say in private."  (Note:  It was clear from Hadas' remarks that Israel's channel to Saudi Arabia does not run through the Foreign Ministry.)   6.  (S) Hadas said the Gulf Arabs believe in Israel's role because of their perception of Israel's close relationship with the U.S. but also due to their sense that they can count on Israel against Iran.  "They believe Israel can work magic," Hadas commented.  When considering a trilateral U.S.-Israel-GCC partnership, Hadas suggested we bear in mind that Iran's nuclear program is the primary source of concern to the U.S. and Israel, while the Gulf Arabs also worry about Iran for a host of historic and sectarian reasons.  7.  (C) PolCouns noted that Arabs say that progress on the Palestinian track would make it easier for them to publicly engage Israel.  Hadas countered that while peace with the Palestinians is an Israeli interest and important in its own right, it should not be the sum total of Israel's relations with the Arab World.  Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa had invented the "never-ending hurdle race" in which Israel could never do enough to deserve a positive response. The Israeli-Palestinian track should not serve as an excuse for the Gulf to avoid action, whether against Iran or through practical steps to support the Palestinian Authority.    ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM

Classified By: Ambassador James B. Cunningham, Reason 1.4 (b) (d)   1. (S) Summary. CODEL Kyl, accompanied by the Ambassador, called on Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu April 6 in the first official U.S. meeting with Netanyahu since he formed a government.  The main topics of discussion were stopping Iran's nuclear program and Netanyahu's approach to peace-making with the Palestinians.  On Iran, Senator Kyl raised ways to increase the effect of sanctions, including possible legislation targeting Iranian imports of refined petroleum.  Adopting a forceful stance, Netanyahu asked repeatedly what the U.S. plans to do if sanctions and engagement fail to stop Iran's program.  Calling Iran's development of a nuclear bomb a world-changing event, Netanyahu said all other issues become insignificant by comparison.  On the Palestinians, Netanyahu reviewed his intent to pursue a three-track approach with political, economic, and security aspects.  While noting that his government is conducting a review of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, Netanyahu asserted that there is agreement within the government and among 80% of Israelis that the Palestinians should be able to rule themselves, but with limits imposed by Israel's security requirements.  Netanyahu said the only difference between his position and that of opposition leader Tzipi Livni is over the name of the goal, i.e. the two-state solution.  In response to comments by Senator Sessions that the Palestinian Authority needs functioning courts and jails as well as police, Netanyahu agreed but said he had not yet focused much on Palestinian governance issues.  Netanyahu said he wants to show the Palestinians the benefits of peace, but with the proviso that if Iran goes nuclear, peace will fail. Predicting that his government would pleasantly surprise many critics, Netanyahu concluded that he hopes to come up with a common approach with President Obama.  End Summary.  2. (U) CODEL Kyl, consisting of Senator Jon Kyl (R, AZ); Senator Jeff Sessions (R, AL); Representative Jane Harman (D, CA); Representative John Kline (R, MN); and Representative Chris Carney (D, PA), called on Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu April 6.  The Ambassador, Congressional staff, and Pol Couns (notetaker) participated in the meeting.  Netanyahu was joined by National Security Adviser Uzi Arad, Spokesman Mark Regev, Policy Adviser Ron Dermer, former chairman of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Kadima MK Tzachi Hanegbi (Senator's Kyl's counterpart in the U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary Committee on National Security), and the Israeli Embassy in Washington's Congressional liaison officer.  The meeting was the first official U.S. face to face contact with Netanyahu since he formed his government.  What Will the U.S. Do About Iran? ---------------------------------  3. (S) After a brief discussion of the world economic crisis, Senator Kyl raised Iran, noting the "sobering" briefings the CODEL had received from senior Israeli defense and intelligence officials the previous day.  Kyl said the Congress is looking at legislation that would target Iran's imports of refined petroleum products, adding that there are only four or five companies that supply refined petroleum to Iran and the U.S. has considerable leverage over most of them.  Kyl added that Israeli experts had told the CODEL that they thought such legislation would be helpful.  Netanyahu said nothing is slowing the progress of Iran's nuclear program.  The Prime Minister asked what will happen to the Middle East if Iran obtains a nuclear weapon?  If such a prospect is unacceptable, what will the U.S. do as Iran reaches the nuclear threshold?  What will the U.S. do if Pakistan is taken over by Islamic radicals?  4. (S) Representative Harman told Netanyahu that no one in the CODEL disagreed with his analysis, but the U.S. should give engagement an opportunity to see if it works.  If it does not, at least it would show the world that the U.S. had tried.  She added that Congress supports engagement on a bipartisan basis.  Senator Kyl added that the Europeans tried to engage Iran for five years but it did not work.  President Obama will pursue engagement, but Kyl said he doubted it would be successful.  We should consider what to do in the mean time.  Netanyahu responded that the U.S. should move quickly.  Engagement should have a short time limit and a specific goal, for example talk to the Iranians for four to twelve weeks and make clear that the U.S. goal is an end to their nuclear program.  Leaning forward, Netanyahu repeated his earlier question:  "What will you do if it does not work?"   TEL AVIV 00000936  002 OF 003   5. (S) Netanyahu said that learning to live with a nuclear Iran would be a big mistake which would lead to a different, more dangerous world.  While he noted that he could not say for certain that Iran would use a nuclear weapon against Israel, if Iran had a bomb Israelis would have to ask that question every day.  This is a historic moment, and leaders have a responsibility to make decisions.  All other issues are insignificant by comparison.  For a third time, Netanyahu asked, "What are you going to do?"   Netanyahu's Approach to the Palestinians ----------------------------------------  6. (C) Senator Kyl asked the Prime Minister about his view of the two-state solution.  Netanyahu said he plans to engage the Palestinian Authority quickly and will not tie political talks with the Palestinians to developments with Iran. Reviewing a now familiar formula, Netanyahu said he will approach the Palestinians on parallel political, economic and security tracks.  Political talks would aim at achieving an agreement within certain limits, the economic approach would promote foreign and Arab investment and joint projects with Israeli partners, while the security track would continue to build up the PA's security forces.  In order to do any of this, Netanyahu noted, he will need a Palestinian partner.  7. (C) Representative Harman observed that the CODEL had visited units of the PA's National Security Forces and the Presidential Guard.  PA Prime Minister Fayyad said he was happy with the PA's security forces, and they want to take on increased responsibility for security in Jericho and Jenin. Netanyahu replied that Israel would be happy to let them do more, but it is not clear what Hamas will do next. If Hamas forces a confrontation, Israel will have to initiate further military action in Gaza. Israel did not want to go back into Gaza, but it will do what is necessary to protect its people.  8. (C) Netanyahu said his government is reviewing Israel's policy toward the Palestinians.  There is a consensus in the government and among 80% of the Israeli public that the Palestinians should be able to govern themselves.  The only limits on Palestinian sovereignty would be elements that affect Israel's security.  A Palestinian state must be demilitarized, without control over its air space and electro-magnetic field, and without the power to enter into treaties or control its borders.  Netanyahu concluded that he and opposition leader Tzipi Livni "only disagree about the name," i.e. the two-state solution.  9. (C) Senator Sessions noted that people everywhere want law and order.  Palestinians not only need to deal with terrorism, they also need a functioning legal system.  Moving from a lawless system, the Palestinian Authority is showing some pride, but police are not enough, they need courts and jails that work.  Economic development is impossible in a lawless society.  Netanyahu agreed this was a valid point and uncharacteristically admitted that he had not focused much on Palestinian governance.  He added that international assistance should provide funding for jails and courts.  It is possible to create crime-free zones and begin economic development "in bubbles" which would then be expanded. Senator Sessions noted that Lt. General Dayton is focused on this issue.  Representative Harman commented that "bubbles" in the West Bank would not be enough, Palestinians need law and order everywhere.  10. (C) Netanyahu said the "classic rhetoric" of the peace process has been that if Israel withdraws, all will be well. Now, however, if Israel withdrew from the West Bank, Hamas would take over.  Economic development would not be a substitute for a political settlement, but it would change the environment and show Palestinians the benefits of peace. Israel has been trying to "build a roof without a foundation" and it has not worked.  Netanyahu said there was one proviso:  If Iran gets a nuke, peace efforts will fail.  11. (C) Netanyahu pointed to the example of Jordanian King Hussein, whom he termed Israel's best Arab ally and a man deeply committed to peace.  Yet when Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, King Hussein got on board with the Iraqis.  In the event of a nuclear Iran, "all the Arabs will become Qatar." We should therefore move in parallel to work for peace with the Palestinians while acting to stop Iran.  Netanyahu said he thought his government would pleasantly surprise many of its critics.  He concluded the meeting by saying that he wants to coordinate Israel's positions with the U.S. and hopes to come to a common position with President Obama.  TEL AVIV 00000936  003 OF 003    12.

His recent travel may also suggest a diminished dependence on his legendary female guard force, as only one woman bodyguard accompanied him to New York. End Summary. QADHAFIS PERSONALITY REFLECTED IN HIS PHOBIAS 2. (S/NF) Muammar al-Qadhafi has been described as both mercurial and eccentric, and our recent first-hand experiences with him and his office, primarily in preparation for his UNGA trip, demonstrated the truth of both characterizations. From the moment Qadhafis staff began to prepare for his travel to the United States, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX of his 40-year rule, various proclivities and phobias began to reveal themselves in every logistical detail. When applying for Qadhafis visa, XXXXXXX asked whether it was necessary for the Leader to submit a portrait of himself that fit consular application regulations, noting that his photo was displayed throughout the city and that anyone of hundreds of billboards could be photographed and shrunken to fit the applications criteria. When the rule was enforced, XXXXXXXXX reluctantly conceded to take a portrait of the Leader specifically for the visa application. 3. (S/NF) When XXXXXXX began to search for proper accommodations for Qadhafi, XXXXXXXX informed us that the Leader must stay on the first floor of any facility that was rented for him. (XXXXXXXXXX separately told U.S. officials in Washington that Qadhafi could not climb more than 35 steps.) XXXXXXXX cited this requirement as the primary reason that the Libyan residence in New Jersey was selected as the preferred accommodation site rather than the Libyan PermReps residence in New York City. XXXXXX also sought to find accommodations with room to pitch Qadhafis Bedouin tent, Qadhafis traditional site for receiving visitors and conducting meetings, as it offers him a non-verbal way of communicating that he is a man close to his cultural roots. 4. (S/NF) Qadhafis dislike of long flights and apparent fear of flying over water also caused logistical headaches for his staff. When discussing flight clearances with Emboffs,XXXXXXXexplained that the Libyan delegation would arrive from Portugal, as Qadhafi cannot fly more than eight hours and would need to overnight in Europe prior to continuing his journey to New York. XXXXXXXX also revealed in the same conversation that Qadhafi does not like to fly over water. Presumably for similar reasons, Qadhafis staff also requested a stop in Newfoundland to break his travel from Venezuela to Libya on September 29. [Note: The Government of Canada recently confirmed that the Libyan delegation canceled plans to stop in Newfoundland. End Note.] DEPENDENCIES: RELIANCE ON A SELECTIVE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS 5. (S/NF) Qadhafi appears to be almost obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel. This group includes XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX coordinate the logistics of Qadhafis visit. XXXXXXXXXX balanced the UNGA preparations between equally frenetic preparations for the August 31 African Union (AU) Summit and September 1 celebration of Qadhafis coup. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX At large events such as the August 31 AU Summit and September 1 celebrations, XXXXXXXXX every last detail of these complex gatherings, ranging from the overall program to the position of the press pool. At UNGA, XXXXXXXXX Qadhafi to the podium at the UNGA and XXXXXXXXXX his papers and props upon the conclusion of the Leaders remarks. Long-time Qadhafi Chief of Staff Bashir Salah appears to play an equally important role in Qadhafis personal retinue, and XXXXXXX via an old-fashioned green phone XXXXXXXX. It is next to a red phone, which presumably connects to Qadhafi himself. We constantly hear that National Security Adviser and son, Muatassim, also plays a key role as his fathers confidante and handler during travel abroad. Muatassim also seems to have been tasked with insuring that the Leaders image is well-preserved through the full array of carefully-planned media events. 6. (S/NF) Finally, Qadhafi relies heavily on his long-time Ukrainian nurse, Galyna Kolotnytska, who has been described as a voluptuous blonde. Of the rumored staff of four Ukrainian nurses that cater to the Leaders health and well-being, XXXXXXXXXXX emphasized to multiple Emboffs that Qadhafi cannot travel without Kolotnytska, as she alone knows his routine. When Kolotnytskas late visa application resulted in her Security Advisory Opinion being received on the day Qadhafis party planned to travel to the U.S., the Libyan Government sent a private jet to ferry her from Libya to Portugal to meet up with the Leader during his rest-stop. Some embassy contacts have claimed that Qadhafi and the 38 year-old Kolotnytska have a romantic relationship. While he did not comment on such rumors, a Ukrainian political officer recently confirmed that the Ukrainian nurses travel everywhere with the Leader. PREFERENCES - FROM DANCING TO HORSEMAN 7. (S/NF) In addition to the personality quirks revealed through Qadhafis travel to New York, the Qadhafis preferences for dancing and cultural performances were displayed over the last month. The three-day spectacle of his 40th anniversary in power included performances by dance troupes from Ukraine, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco, as well as musical performances by bands from Mexico, Russia, New Zealand, and a number of other nations. Qadhafi appeared particularly enthralled by Tuareg horse racing during two of the events, clapping and smiling throughout the races. The flamenco dancers that participated in his celebratory events appeared to spark a similar interest, as Qadhafi decided to stop in Seville (for a personal trip according to the Spanish Ambassador here) on his way back to Libya from Venezuela specifically to attend a flamenco dance performance. [Note: That stop has reportedly been scrapped for unknown reasons. End note.] NO NEW YORK PHOTO OPS - QADHAFI LEAVES FEMALE GUARDS AT HOME 8. (S/NF) While Qadhafis reported female guard force has become legendary, it played no role in his travels to New York. Only one female guard was included among the approximately 350-person strong Libyan delegation to New York. This is the same female bodyguard who sticks close to Qadhafi in his domestic and international public appearances and may, in fact, play some sort of formal security role. Observers in Tripoli speculate that the female guard force is beginning to play a diminished role among the Leaders personal security staff. 9. (S/NF) Comment: Qadhafis state visits and appearances at various conferences and summits, both at home and abroad, have revealed greater details about his personality and character. While it is tempting to dismiss his many eccentricities as signs of instability, Qadhafi is a complicated individual who has managed to stay in power for forty years through a skillful balancing of interests and realpolitik methods. Continued engagement with Qadhafi and his inner circle is important not only to learn the motives and interests that drive the worlds longest serving dictator, but also to help overcome the misperceptions that inevitably accumulated during Qadhafis decades of isolation. As  XXXXXXX told us, pointing to a larger-than-life portrait of Qadhafi, When you have been isolated for so long, it is important to communicate. End comment. CRETZ
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 UNVIE VIENNA 000540  SIPDIS  FOR P, T, H, ISN, S/SANAC, IO, NEA, SCA, EAP H PLS PASS STAFFDEL AS APPROPRIATE DOE FOR S2 AND NA-20 NSC FOR SCHEINMAN, RYU, TALWAR  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/01/2019 TAGS: PREL KNNP AORC IR SY KN INSUBJECT: STAFFDEL KESSLER EXAMINES IRAN, SYRIA, AND MULTILATERAL VIENNA'S FRUSTRATING NAM DYNAMIC  REF: EMBASSY VIENNA 1450  Classified By: Mark Scheland, Counselor for Nuclear Policy; reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (S) Summary: HFAC staffers Richard Kessler and David Fite received from IAEA Secretariat November 10 information on the Iran case that tracked with the tone of the subsequent Director General's reporting on Iran to the Board of Governors.  The STAFFDEL heard that contact with Iran over "possible military dimensions" of the nuclear program was at an "absolute stalemate."  According to Safeguards regional division director Herman Nackaerts, IAEA inspectors' first visit to the enrichment facility under construction near Qom had run predictably but without extraordinary responsiveness on Iran's part; the Secretariat was still trying to understand the motivation to build the plant as now designed.  Nackaerts described the frustrating limitations of Iran's cooperation with the Agency, and the STAFFDEL deduced that Iranian officials held back because they were uncertain about what lines of inquiry the IAEA was best equipped to exploit. Questioning then-DG ElBaradei's remark to media that the Agency had found "nothing to worry about" in Qom, STAFFDEL asked if the Secretariat would report on how it judged the plant did or did not fit into Iran's publicly explained nuclear program.  Nackaerts expressed appreciation for the precision and usefulness of U.S.-supplied information in the Qom case and generally.  2.  (C) Summary contd.: On Syria, Nackaerts said the Secretariat had told Damascus its first explanation for the presence of anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor was not credible.  Further, the Secretariat still could not yet present the case for how what was being built at Dair Alzour fit in as "part of a Syrian program or part of someone else's program."  On DPRK, IAEA/EXPO's Tariq Rauf said the IAEA, when it could, would ultimately have to "go back to the early 1990s" to reconstruct accountancy of plutonium and could not accept a "political" compromise setting material "off to the side."  To get to a finding of "no diversion" would take several years and extensive resources and forensics.  3.  (SBU) Contd.:  Treating Technical Cooperation, the STAFFDEL received the same briefing on the Safeguards Department's project review process and internal database that was provided to a GAO review team in 2008.  IAEA External Relations Director Rauf asserted, "We are not a denial organization."   STAFFDEL related how segments of the GAO report had reduced Congressional confidence in the efficiency of TC.  U.S. national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk. Secretariat also described hindrances it faces in having UN and national development officials recognize and integrate nuclear applications.  4.  (SBU) Contd.:  The STAFFDEL also engaged P5-plus-1 heads of mission over lunch on the means to draw or impel Iran to open up on its nuclear program and on dynamics in Vienna between blocs of Member States.  End Summary.  Fordow/Qom and Iran PMD: Frustration, but Good Support from the U.S. -------------------------------------  5.  (U) House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Majority Staff Director Richard Kessler and Professional Staff Member David Fite (STAFFDEL) spent ninety minutes with IAEA staff on November 10.  Principal issues were safeguards verification in Iran and Syria, the screening of IAEA Technical Cooperation (TC) projects for proliferation risk, and TC Department efforts to improve project design and integration into national and UN development activities.  STAFFDEL affirmed to Secretariat officials that the HFAC under Chairman Berman: was strongly supportive of the IAEA; put emphasis on counter-proliferation issues in countries of concern (indeed, was weighing legislation to impose further U.S. sanctions on Iran); had advocated an increase in NADR funding for extrabudgetary contributions to the IAEA, including for the Safeguards Analytical laboratory; and, supported "getting the U.S. up to date" on payment of its assessments to the IAEA's regular budget.  Following the meeting at the IAEA, STAFFDEL consulted Ambassador and Mission staff and had a working lunch with P5-plus-1 heads of mission focused on Iran and the dynamics of multilateral  UNVIE VIEN 00000540  002 OF 005   diplomacy in Vienna.  STAFFDEL's UNVIE program followed a day of consultations with Austrian officials (reftel).  6.  (SBU) IAEA Safeguards Department Operations B (AOR Mideast, South Asia, parts of Europe, the Americas, and all nuclear weapons states) Director Herman Nackaerts briefed STAFFDEL on the inspection he had led a few weeks before to the recently disclosed Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant near Qom in Iran.  Nackaerts said Iranian officials had been open to allowing inspectors access.  The Secretariat was still trying to understand, he said, why Iran would build this facility, scaled as it was for 3000 centrifuges in contrast to the much large Natanz facility.  It was positive, Nackaerts pointed out, that Fordow was now under safeguards.  He noted that the IAEA had "at least two" safeguards inspectors at work in Iran "every day of the year" and would henceforth plan to visit Fordow regularly.  Asked how "complete" the plant was or when it would be operational, Nackaerts said, "The information we got from Member States proved to be very precise" on this point.  Asked about permission to take samples at Fordow, Nackaerts replied that Iranian officials had permitted the inspectors to perform the same safeguards procedures they typically undertook at Natanz.  7.  (S) STAFFDEL asked if the Agency enjoyed full access to the Arak IR-40 plant.  Nackaerts related there had been no access for a 12-month period but normal access in August and October 2009.  However, the Iranians "claim they cannot go back on the decision of their parliament, and hence grant the IAEA a "visit" but do not call it Design Information Verification.  On possible military dimensions (PMD), Nackaerts said the Secretariat's approach was to follow lines of inquiry that could involve use of nuclear material, for example, the documents treating uranium metal or green salt. The Iranians, he said in a tone conveying his skepticism, asserted the uranium metal document was "mistakenly" included in a packet of information they received from the AQ Khan network but was nothing Iran had asked for or used.  The "green salt" documentation Iran dismissed as a forgery. Indeed, Nackaerts went on, Iran replied basically on the form of documents, not on their substance.  The Secretariat had not been "impressed" by the 117-page rejoinder Iran had provided to the initial presentation of PMD documentation. It had told Iran the information hung together too much for it all to have bee fabricated and asked that, if some of the documentation were "doctored," Iranian officials should show the Secretariat "where the truth ends."  Since August 2008, (when Ahmadinejad personally shut off Nackaerts's previously approved visit to workshops indicated in the documentation), Nackaerts concluded, there remained a high-level decision not to cooperate.  STAFFDEL member Fite took from this that the Iranians were holding back "because they don't know where any opening will lead."  Nackaerts agreed, saying they knew that every question they answered would bring another question.   8.  (S) Fite alluded to then-DG ElBaradei's remarks of a few days before in U.S. media to the effect that the inspectors had found "nothing to worry about" in Fordow.  Acknowledging the practical meaning of this remark -- that there were no centrifuges or nuclear material present -- Fite nevertheless regretted the headline and asked if the DG's formal report to Board members (Note: subsequently released as GOV/2009/74, deresticted by the Board November 27, and available to the public at www.iaea.org) would deal with how Qom fits or does not fit into Iran's explained nuclear program.  Nackaerts replied, "We will identify the issues we're working."  He went on that understanding the timeline of Fordow's development was hindered by Iran's practice never to involve people who really know the facts or the government's intentions in discussion with the Agency.  The officials with whom inspectors meet clearly are "steered" by unseen observers, who send notes to the Iranian interlocutors during meetings.  Iran recorded the meetings, he added, but did not permit the IAEA to do so.  Further, the Secretariat never received original design documents, but ones produced for the Secretariat that were technically true to the facilities they found upon inspection.  Against this Iranian practice, Nackaerts added, the Secretariat received very precise information from Member States that helped inspectors decide what to ask about.  The organization of this information was good and, while the Agency was satisfied, it had inquired if more information could be shared with the Agency, "not necessarily for release to Iran," he said.  Syria Stalemate  UNVIE VIEN 00000540  003 OF 005   ---------------  9.  (SBU) The Syria case, Nackaerts said, was starting to look like Iran in that the government provided "good cooperation" on some areas but presented a "stalemate" on others.  The Secretariat challenged Syria's proposed explanation for the presence of uranium at Dair Alzour/Al Kibar (i.e., that Israeli depleted uranium munitions could be the source), but the inquiry was at a roadblock.  Syrian officials had been told their first explanation for anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) was not credible, and the Agency had inquired what nuclear material Syria could have had that was not previously declared.  Overall, the IAEA still "did not understand" (meaning, it could not yet present the solid case for) how Dair Alzour fit in as part of a Syrian nuclear program "or part of someone else's program."  Return to DPRK? Safeguards in India? --------------------  10.  (SBU) Asked how quickly IAEA inspectors could resume work in North Korea if re-admitted by the government, Tariq Rauf of IAEA External Relations and Policy Coordination (EXPO) observed that the last resumption had taken a week (for technical set-up, re-activation of cameras, etc.). Safeguards Operations A division had a program set out for what steps to undertake "under circumstances the DPRK may let us back in."  Rauf continued that the Agency would to go back to the early 1990s' plutonium revelation to reconstruct material accountancy.  When most recently in the DPRK, the IAEA had been monitoring facility shutdown processes but not implementing NPT safeguards on DPRK material.  The Agency could "not accept" political compromises that would set some nuclear material "off to the side".  Then-DG ElBaradei had called for implementation of the Additional Protocol in DPRK, but even if Pyongyang cooperated fully it would take several years and much in the way of resources and forensics to be able to get to a finding of "no diversion."  11.  (SBU) Asked about progress toward safeguards implementation in India, Rauf confirmed the GOI had submitted a "formal list" of facilities that was not a document the Agency would characterize as a formal declaration under its safeguards agreement.  India was under no mandatory timeline to make its declaration as it was not an NPT signatory. (Comment: Rauf's characterization was flat wrong.  Mission had learned from the Safeguards Department three weeks before this meeting that India had officially "notified" two new facilities (Raps 5 and 6) under its 2008 safeguards agreement, that surveillance systems had been installed, and the facilities were under safeguards.  End Comment.)  Scrutinizing and Promoting IAEA Technical Cooperation --------------------------  12.  (U) Renaud Chatelus of the Safeguards Division of Information Management (SGIM) acquainted STAFFDEL with IAEA screening of Technical Cooperation (TC) projects for their potential to afford access to sensitive technologies. Grounded in a 1979 Agency Information Circular, INFCIRC/267, the practice is to focus on projects related to enrichment, heavy water production, reprocessing of spent fuel, and plutonium or mixed oxide fuel.  Chatelus said SGIM reviewed projects submitted, project approved, individual procurement actions, and overall implementation of projects.  Reviews are conducted completely in-house, he said in reply to a question.  Using the same PowerPoint slides that were presented to a GAO review team in 2008, Chatelus illustrated with screen shots from the Agency's staff access-only database the system of flagging projects for: compliance with INFCIRC 267, compliance with INFCIRC 540 (Additional Protocol), transfer of "sensitive items" on the Nuclear Suppliers Group or dual-use lists, general interest, or possible relation to a safeguarded facility.  In subsequent discussion of the impact of screening and Member States' sense of entitlement to TC, EXPO's Tariq Rauf affirmed, "We are not a denial organization."  13.  (U) STAFFDEL member Fite observed that segments of the GAO report treating transfers to state sponsors of terrorism as well as on program management had reduced Congressional confidence about TC.  Fite said he had approached Appropriations staff about using a supplemental funding bill  UNVIE VIEN 00000540  004 OF 005   to resolve slow U.S. payment of assessments and do more for the Agency, but was rebuffed because the GAO report on TC had "poisoned the waters."  Apart from political objections to certain TC recipients benefitting from U.S. funding, he added, a persisting "Achilles heel" was that U.S. national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk.  TC Department representative Johannes Seybold replied that the Agency aimed to provide Member States six weeks time for review, but was also at the mercy of requesting states providing the relevant project information.  Just the compendium of project titles and short descriptions became a very thick document in each biennial cycle, Seybold went on, and the Agency was "struggling" with some Member States' national policies to be able to go beyond this level of transparency.  14.  (U) STAFFDEL's meeting with Secretariat officials concluded in an exchange with Seybold, TC's section head for strategy and partnerships, about the IAEA's awkward position in development efforts coordinated by the UN or by developing countries' national institutions.  Seybold laid out the following.  The IAEA's cooperation with TC recipient states occurs through National Liaison Officers, generally in the atomic energy commission or government ministry responsible for nuclear power or radiological sources.  Generally, neither the IAEA nor the corresponding national entity is a participant in UN development team or host government deliberations about development in the recipient country. Two-thirds of TC projects address development issues for which the IAEA is not the responsible lead agency in the UN system, e.g., water quality and availability, food security, climate.  In many cases, national authorities and the UN team responsible for these areas in a given country lack awareness of IAEA capabilities, and/or they maintain a distance from things "nuclear."  Seybold related Agency efforts to integrate with these authorities through the UNDAF (UN Development Assistance Framework) process and other partnering efforts.  STAFFDEL expressed encouragement for bringing nuclear applications to greater impact in the development field.  P5-plus-1 Ambassadors Regret Iranian Paralysis on TRR; Depict Grim Dynamic with G-77/NAM --------------------------------------------- -  15.  (C) STAFFDEL was the guests of honor at lunch hosted by the Ambassador with his counterparts from China, Germany, Russia, and the UK and the French Charge d'Affaires.  Kessler and Fite laid out HFAC's interest and Chairman Berman's supportive posture toward the Agency, as they had for Secretariat staff.  Opening discussion of Iran, UK Ambassador Simon Smith said the Iranian answer on the ElBaradei-brokered deal on refueling the Tehran research reactor (TRR) "had to be 'yes' or 'no,' not waffling" as it had been.  German Ambassador Ruediger Luedeking posited that the U.S. Administration had confounded Iranian internal processes and the latest EU3 proposal had "cornered" Iran.  Agreeing that Iran faced an imperative between "yes" and "no," Luedeking observed, "they can't answer."  HFAC Staff Director Kessler noted the committee had tried to follow up a Larijani approach conveyed one year before for a meeting with Chairman Berman, but found that the Iranians backed off.  16.  (C) Russian Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevskiy asserted that confidentiality was a major concern for Iran.  He noted its TRR counter-proposals, either to keep its LEU on its territory under IAEA safeguards until released in exchange for fuel rods, or to swap outgoing LEU piecemeal for incoming fuel assemblies.  Moving beyond the TRR issue, UK Ambassador said he was severely disappointed that Member States had been unable to "apply consequences for the breaking of rules" of the organization.  We needed to convince some other Member States, he continued, that tolerating rule breaking as on Qom and Code 3.1 (of the Subsidiary Arrangement of Iran's Safeguards Agreement) risked bringing the organization into discredit.  STAFFDEL member Fite asked if Iran's Arab neighbors were among the problem interlocutors in Vienna; he asserted that officials of Arabian Peninsula countries told the Congress they see Iran as an "existential threat."  While they may seek the cover of international signals or sanctions imposed by others, they say they do want action against Iran.  17.  (C) Segueing from Iran to DPRK, Chinese Ambassador Hu Xiaodi said the main difference between the cases was that progress with DPRK had been achieved when the North Koreans  UNVIE VIEN 00000540  005 OF 005   wanted something specific, whereas he (Hu) had never heard Iranian officials say that they wanted a settlement, or that they wanted anything specific.  Although we did not at present know "how" to reach a deal with Iran, Hu concluded, we were not in the worst situation, in which Iran explicitly does want something -- nuclear weapons.  Asked if he genuinely thought the DPRK would give up its weapons program for aid, Hu said "hope" (as opposed to "think.")   Ambassador Davies seriously questioned that Pyongyang would give up a weapons capability in exchange for a significant material improvement in our relations, as the government would likely calculate it had been its possession of weapons that won the concessions.  18.  (SBU) Ambassador turned the discussion to the dynamic between groups of Member States, as illustrated in the ongoing discussion of a Technical Cooperation project to advance IAEA use of "results based management."  The German Ambassador observed that NAM positions on many issues were characterized by "myths" and they were clearly being dictated by Iran and Egypt.  Ambassador Davies asked if the dynamic was further charged by states beginning to suspect that the U.S. seriously intends to strengthen the Agency in all its functions -- with the uncertain shifts in practice and distribution of resources and clout that could mean. STAFFDEL lead Kessler said the Congressional perception was one of a "lightning change" from the last Administration to the present one in U.S. approaches to the IAEA, to development assistance globally, and to multilateralism. German Ambassador agreed and said this was a complication for NAM states that know they are the immobile ones now.  Yet, TC was a "sacred cow" and the NAM's impulse was to reject "illegitimate intrusion" into its distribution.  19.  (SBU) French Charge Philippe Merlin discouraged STAFFDEL from expecting diplomatic gains, say in the NPT review, through greater generosity on IAEA peaceful use programs. "TC is the price we pay," he said, for developing countries' acquiescence toward the safeguards regime, the thing we really want.  Fite asked if a reasoned discussion with development officials in capitals about making TC deliver more impact could translate into different instructions to the obstreperous missions in Vienna.  German Ambassador took the view that any effort to change TC would be seen in capitals as "per se bad."  It was more advisable to advocate to NAM states what their own interests in the safeguards regime were.  UK Ambassador agreed there were no points to be scored by asking NAM capitals about TC effectiveness; he added that the UK Government "doesn't give two hoots" about TC, given the small funding level (from the UK Energy Ministry) in comparison to Britain's official development assistance.  TC was, also in the UK view, the price we pay for the IAEA we want.  20.  (U) STAFFDEL did not review this report.   DAVIES
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 UNVIE VIENNA 000553  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2023 TAGS: PREL IR AU AORC KNNPSUBJECT: AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR TO IRAN DESCRIBES ELECTIONS AS DRIVING TEHRAN ENVIRONMENT  REF: UNVIE 544  Classified By: DCM Geoff Pyatt for reasons 1.4 (c) and (e)  1.  (C)   Summary.  On December 3, former Austrian Ambassador to Tehran Michael Postl (please protect) debriefed MsnOff on his final calls on Iranian officials as he left post.  He noted that former Presidents Khatami and Rafsanjani both had extracted themselves from the normal political scene and were focused on tangential issues where their weight could still be felt.  Nevertheless, Rafsanjani suggested that it would be helpful if the West spoke out against the election fraud and human rights violations that followed.  2.  (C)   Postl said that President Ahmadinejad's chief of cabinet, Mashaie, made clear to him prior to the Geneva talks that Iran was planning to approach the talks with a spirit of compromise and that Postl would be "surprised" by Iran's attitude.  Postl explained the lack of follow-through in the wake of the talks as a probable decision by Supreme Leader Khamenei that the West was not trustworthy or that Iran could get more from the P5 plus 1 than the six offered in Geneva. Majles Speaker Larijani's outspoken disapproval of the Tehran Research Reactor deal advocated by Ahmadinejad could have been an exercise of Larijani's first opportunity to undermine Ahmadinejad after he was pressured to disavow himself of knowledge that Iranian prisoners were being raped in jail, which lost him credibility with the Iranian public.  Finally, Postl argued that the U.S. should focus its outreach to Iran on formats that Iranians perceive are less biased, such as BBC Persian's version of Hardtalk or Press TV.  End Summary.  3.  (C)   On December 3, former Austrian Ambassador to Tehran Michael Postl gave MsnOff a readout of the state of domestic political wranglings in Tehran prior to his departure from post in October.  Now posted in Vienna, Postl noted that he still advises the Austrian government on Iran issues and that he was recently asked to see if his contacts in Iran would meet with him even though he had departed post.  Many said that they would, so he may be asked by the Austrian Foreign Ministry to return to Iran periodically to make use of the excellent contacts he was afforded given his Farsi skills and native Iranian wife.  4.  (C)   Postl recounted his final calls on contacts in Iran before leaving post, noting that many who had refused meetings with him after the elections were now willing to meet him.  When he met with former President Khatami, Khatami noted that because of the post-election environment, it did not make sense to talk about politics.  Postl suggested that they discuss the possibility of Khatami pursuing a dialogue of civilizations or religions that might give him an opening to the West.  Khatami noted that he did want to focus more on that kind of dialogue and engagement and that he might come to Austria next year in pursuit of such discussions.  ------------------------------------------- Final Calls Reveal Disillusionment with the Possibilities for Change -------------------------------------------  5.  (C)   Postl noted that in his final calls, he sought out a meeting with the new health minister, Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi since he was interested in meeting the Islamic Republic's first female minister.  Postl described her as "sort of a puppet" and very insecure despite her good credentials for the job.  She is a member of the Larijani family, giving this influential clan placement in the executive branch, in addition to the leverage they hold through the key posts of Ali Larijani as Majles Speaker and Javad Larijani as head of the Judiciary.  In their meeting, Dastjerdi and Postl discussed possible cooperation between Iran and Austria in hospitals, training, and person-to-person contacts in the medical field.  6.  (C)   Postl also called on the powerful new chief of President Ahmadinejad's cabinet, Mashaie.  Postl said that many believed that Mashaie's rejection for a vice presidential post showed that there were disagreements between Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader, but the fact that he was given the slot as head of the cabinet means that Khamenei must not be fundamentally opposed to him.  Postl was candid with Mashaie, noting that although the Iranian elections were an internal matter, the treatment of civilians in the aftermath of the elections was wrong by any calculation.  Postl assessed that using Farsi instead of English made a difference in the reaction he received to this candor, and Mashaie said that he would be pleased to meet with Postl again if he were in Iran.   UNVIE VIEN 00000553  002 OF 004   7.  (C)   In what Postl believes was the first meeting former President Rafsanjani had granted to a Westerner -- and perhaps the first meeting with a foreigner -- since the elections, the two discussed economic cooperation, which Rafsanjani said was his primary focus.  They avoided the topics of the election and the nuclear issue, especially given the presence of 10 to 15 "watchers" from different veins of the Iranian government.  Rafsanjani was very interested in non-nuclear energy cooperation and asked very detailed questions about wind energy, which Postl said Austria would be able to help with.  Rafsanjani also discussed his sense of how the Iranian government could evolve, arguing that change must come from within Iran and that interference from foreigners was not welcome in most circumstances.  Nevertheless, Rafsanjani believed that the best help possible from foreigners would be to say that the elections were not fair and to note the human rights violations in the aftermath, though he was not specific about what he thought the influence of such statements would be. Postl noted that recent months clearly had been hard on Rafsanjani; he looked pale and had lost a lot of weight, but his eyes were still "active," according to Postl.  8.  (C)   Postl described the positions of presidential candidates Karrubi and Musavi as children of the revolution and argued that neither of them wants systemic change. Rather, they hoped to give Iran a "human face."  Since the "population of Iran," according to Postl, opposes the Islamic system, the people are not very strongly behind either of these candidates.  In closing out his comments on his final meetings in Tehran, Postl noted that after he departed post, his contacts were questioned thoroughly and aggressively, which Postl described as a reality of life in Iran and contact with a Westerner.  -------------------------------- Infighting and Confusion Driving the Nuclear Issue --------------------------------  9.  (C)   In his discussions at the end of September with Mashaie, Postl encouraged him to ensure that Iran did not "miss the opportunity" presented by the talks in Geneva. Mashaie responded that Iran would be "sure to take" advantage of this opportunity and told Postl that Postl would be surprised at Iran's approach, that Iran would come with seriousness and an attitude of compromise.  Postl's assessment is that Iran decided that this was the right time to show flexibility in order to get an agreement, especially since Ahmadinejad wants to claim responsibility for an agreement with the West.  Postl believes that Nuclear Negotiator Jalili came to Geneva with this spirit of compromise and was following direction, presumably from Ahmadinejad.  Iran's failure to follow through on these agreements may have been due to a decision by Khamenei either that the West was not trustworthy despite Iran's supposed good intentions or that Iran could get more from the West or P5 plus 1 than was offered in Geneva.  Despite the fact that people close to the President say he wants "more," the system gets in the way as do Ahmadinejad's bad advisers.  Postl's interlocutors say that if Ahmadinejad alone were to decide about engagement with the West, "things would move more quickly."  Postl noted that Khamenei is still respected in Iran and, in his personal opinion, there is no essential divergence between the Supreme Leader and Ahmadinejad.  On issues where the Supreme Leader's opinions were clear, Postl argued that other influential Iranians would not "touch on issues," even to undercut Ahmadinejad.  The only way to challenge these leaders was to focus on "unjust" or un-Islamic behavior.  10.  (C)   Postl said that Majles Speaker Larijani probably was not in favor of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) deal, but when MsnOff questioned whether he really opposed the deal or was responding to the fact that Ahmadinejad came out in favor of the deal, Postl recounted another possibility tied to the post-election environment.  Postl noted that he had asked someone close to Larijani whether he was aware of the rapes of election-related prisoners.  The interlocutors said that not only was Larijani aware, but all officials were aware of what was going on inside the prison.  Nevertheless, when Larijani spoke publicly about the issue, he stated clearly that the rapes are not occurring and thus lost some credibility with the Iranian public.  To have not given a more ambiguous response, such as that he would look into the situation, Larijani must have been under strong pressure from above, in Postl's estimation.  Given the clarity that what Ahmadinejad had done after the election was wrong and Larijani's distaste for Ahmadinejad, the TRR proposal may have been Larijani's first opportunity to strike back at  UNVIE VIEN 00000553  003 OF 004   Ahmadinejad.  11.  (C)   Postl also noted that Iran probably has whiplash from the international community's response to the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), which will complicate our efforts to press Iran into compliance with its obligations. Although IAEA Director General ElBaradei said after the first inspection of the FFEP that it was nothing more than "a hole in a mountain," the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution against Iran, citing the FFEP as one of its main points (ref A). Postl argued that this probably leads Iran to believe that the international community is not serious about the issue, and that, rather, this is "a game."  12.  (C)   One of Postl's contacts close to the Supreme Leader pointed him to a Kayhan article from December 1, written by editor Shariatmadari, which espouses the views of Khamenei on the nuclear issue.  The article argues that Iran has gotten nothing from cooperation and should withdraw from the NPT immediately.  Since Khamenei has said that he is not opposed to an opening with the U.S., it becomes about Washington presenting the right arguments at the right time. However, Postl said that bringing up the issue of the detained Americans at Geneva probably fell flat with the Iranians.  Iranian officials told Postl that they were surprised that American officials raised this issue at those talks.  This was the wrong time to bring up this issue, Postl argued, since these issues are not connected in the minds of the Iranians.  (We will explain to the Austrians why this issue is so important and resonates so much to the U.S.) Postl suggested that the UK model was better:  when their sailors were captured, UK officials said that this issue had nothing to do with the political problems between the two countries.  The dissociation of the issues worked in favor of getting the sailors released.  Pressed on when might be such a right time to address the U.S. detainees, Postl suggested that one such way might have been to capitalize on the October 1 Geneva talks by following up quickly with a call from Under Secretary Burns to Jalili "in the spirit of Geneva."  During that phone call, Burns could engage Jalili on the detainee issue as an aside.  Postl also noted that some of his Iranian government contacts had noted with pleasure the appointment of Ambassador Limbert to deal with the Iranian file given his understanding of Iran.  ---------------------------- Postl's Tehran Retrospective ----------------------------  13.  (C)   Looking back on his tenure as Ambassador to Iran, Postl noted that the biggest "game changer" had been this past summer's presidential elections.  The events were causing backlash from much of the population.  Parents and grandparents were saying, according to Postl, that they do not want their children to be forced to experience the same Iran that they, themselves, have been living under for the last 30 years.  For the first time, one can see "kill Khamenei" and "death to Khamenei" scrawled on walls in Tehran.  These direct challenges to Khamenei's authority are new and significant.  Additionally, Postl expects that the population was disillusioned by the overwhelming fraud in the elections and many will not vote in the future.  14.  (C)   On engagement, Postl suggested that some ways forward for the U.S. and Iran might be to look into using a route from Chah Bahar, on Iran's southern coast, to get U.S. supplies into Afghanistan and using the assumption of office by new IAEA Director General Amano to press for "a new start" on the Additional Protocol and additional transparency measures discussions.  15.  (C)   Postl reiterated his message that Iranian citizens see the Voice of America (VOA) as biased and asked that we not underestimate their frustration.  If they see a pervasive media outlet as biased, this presents the U.S. in a negative light and works against U.S. messaging. He said that Iranians currently are faced with two biased choices: VOA and Iranian Broadcasting (IRIB).  In response to a MsnOff question about how BBC Persian is perceived, he noted that it is seen as more neutral, but has the stigma of being associated with the UK.  Postl floated the idea of U.S. support to Euro News to start broadcasting in Farsi.  He also suggested that doing Hardtalk in Persian might be one of the best outlets for U.S. arguments since the format of pitting opposing viewpoints against one another would counteract the perception of bias, but suggested that if our arguments to the Iranian people are not convincing, this quickly would become clear.  Finally, Postl noted that the U.S. should not shy away from interviews with Iranian media outlets, suggesting Press TV because it is in English and it is watched in Tehran.  A program built  UNVIE VIEN 00000553  004 OF 004   around broadcasting the differing opinions of the U.S., India (because its opinion is well-respected given its influence as a leader in the Nonaligned Movement), and Iran might be a useful way to get our messages across while counteracting perceptions of bias.

S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000069  NOFORN SIPDIS FROM AMBASSADOR  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2020/02/09 TAGS: PREL MARR MOPS AESUBJECT: UAE - SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF CJCS  CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Olson, Ambasador; REASON: 1.4(A), (B), (C), (D)  1.  (SBU) Admiral Mullen:  we warmly welcome your visit to Abu Dhabi, and have requested an appointment with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MbZ), whom you last met on 9 September 2009 in Washington.  We have also requested a meeting with your counterpart, Lieutenant General Hamad al-Thani al-Romaithi, Chief of Staff of the UAE Armed Forces, whom you last met on 8 October 2009 in Washington.    --------------------------------------------- -----  The Relationship  --------------------------------------------- -----    2.  (S/NF) The UAE is one of our closest partners in the Middle East and one of our most useful friends worldwide.  -- Al-Dhafra Air Force Base is the high altitude ISR hub for the AOR, and supports 50 percent of aerial refueling in the AOR.  -- Ports in Dubai and Fujairah are the logistics backbone for the U.S. Fifth.  Jebel Ali (Dubai) is the most frequented USN liberty port after Norfolk.  -- Minhad Air Base is a critical hub for Coalition/ISAF partners in Afghanistan, including the Australians, Dutch, Canadians, Brits and Kiwis.  -- The UAE is a cash customer with FMS sales in excess of $11 billion.  Commercial sales have an equivalent value.  An additional $12 billion of FMS cases are in development with approximately the same volume of commercial sales in the works.  -- The UAE recently purchased nine Patriot batteries, and expects to move forward on the purchase of THAAD as the first non US customer.  -- The UAE currently commands CJTF-152 (Arabian Gulf) and maintains an active exercise schedule with U.S. (Red Flag) and other multi-lateral partners.  -- The UAE recently hosted an AFCENT survey team to consider U.S. access to Liwa (Safran) Air Base in support of contingency operations.  -- Additionally, the UAE is considering hosting the Regional Integrated Air and Missile Defense Center of Excellence.    --------------------------------------------- -----  Iran - the Primordial Concern  --------------------------------------------- -----    3.  (S) The UAE leadership sees Iran as its primary external threat, and one that is existential in nature.  Like much of the international community, the UAE finds the idea of an Iran with nuclear weapons unacceptable and thinks this eventuality would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  At least as worrying to MbZ are Iran's aspirations for regional hegemony by support for terrorist proxies (Hizballah, HAMAS, possibly underground organizations in the Arab Gulf countries).  MbZ is skeptical that Iran can be convinced to end its nuclear weapons program, and is not convinced that the international community will adopt tough sanctions.  In other words, he sees the logic of war dominating the region, and this thinking explains his near obsessive efforts to build up the UAE's armed forces.    4.  (S/NF) MbZ's main message to us during his September visit was that we needed to be better coordinated for Iran contingencies. High level engagement by CENTCOM planners have helped to address this concern, but he believes we have made less progress in addressing what he sees as the slow pace of deliveries of US  security assistance and he is still worried that he does not have enough equipment in place to defend his people when war with Iran breaks out.  (And for MbZ it is a matter of when, not if.)  We have repeatedly presented to his staff the various explanations for what he perceives as delays, but he remains unconvinced that we are addressing his concerns as a matter of priority.    --------------------------------------------- -----  Afghanistan - Pakistan:  A Solid Partner  --------------------------------------------- -----    5.  (S) Afghanistan:  UAE SOF has been quietly deployed as part of OEF since 2003, and the UAE surged its contribution in 2009 adding a combined arms task force.  The UAE's UAV capability has been a much appreciated force multiplier.  On the economic development side, the UAE has pledged about $300 M in assistance, and quietly supported the Afghan Reintegration Fund at the recent London Conference.  You should thank MbZ for his leadership in being the first Arab country to send troops to Afghanistan.    6.  (C) Pakistan:  the UAE has taken a leading role in the Friends of Pakistan initiative and has provided about $800 M in assistance in recent years.  The Al Nahyan family had a long-standing relationship with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and this has transitioned to support for her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, but the UAE stays in touch with all elements on the Pakistani scene, including Musharraf.  MbZ will be very interested in your dialogue with General Kayani.    7.  (S/NF) Threat finance:  we have a cooperative relationship with the UAE at the Federal level on addressing Taliban financing.  As our information has begun to flow, we have seen increasing activity and interest on the part of UAE authorities.  That said, the subject is delicate and operational aspects are best handled through our well established Treasury/Intelligence channel.    --------------------------------------------- -----  Yemen:  Increasing Concern  --------------------------------------------- -----    8. (S/NF) MbZ shares our concern about Yemen, and if anything, is more alarmed about the possibility for destabilization of Saudi Arabia.  He is convinced that the Iranians are involved in Yemen, and supporting the Houthi rebels.  When we tell him that we have no evidence of Iranian support, he is somewhat incredulous, suggesting that our focus on Al Qaeda has caused us to lose sight of the bigger picture of Iranian adventurism.  You should encourage him to provide any specific information on Iranian activities to us through intelligence channels.    --------------------------------------------- -----  Iraq:  the Bellwether for Iran  --------------------------------------------- -----    9.  (S) Iraq:  the UAE was the first GCC Country to cancel Saddam era debt and re-establish an embassy, and has generally followed a policy of constructive engagement with the Maliki Government.  But MbZ runs hot and cold on Iraq.  Sometimes he chooses to emphasize his supportive position; at other times he suggests that Iran has been the big winner in Iraq, and that Southern Iraq will be one of the major flashpoints in the upcoming confrontation with Iran. Anything you can say to reassure him about the US commitment to  Iraqi stability will be helpful. OLSON
S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000097  NOFORN SIPDIS FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/IR  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2020/02/22 TAGS: PREL PGOV ETTC UNSC IR AESUBJECT: CODEL LOWEY WITH UAE FOREIGN MINISTER ON IRAN  CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Olson, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)  1. (S/NF) Summary.  In a February 17 meeting, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan (AbZ) discussed Iran with a four-member Congressional delegation led by Chairwoman Nita Lowey of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. AbZ told the Codel the nuclear issue is only one aspect of the Iran problem, and that Iran's regional meddling was a serious concern. He pledged the UAE's backing as the US rallies support for new sanctions but questioned whether they would achieve the desired effect.  AbZ noted the UAE's growing concern that Gulf allies were being shut out of Iran sanctions planning.  End Summary.    IRAN'S REACTORS AND REACH  -------------------------    2. (S/NF) AbZ began by expressing pride in the US-UAE 123 agreement and the bilateral relationship generally.  According to AbZ, the 123 is a powerful example for the region and provides a transparent alternative to Iran's nuclear model.  The UAE views Iran as a huge problem that goes far beyond nuclear capabilities.  Iranian support for terrorism is broader than just Hamas and Hizballah.  Iran has influence in Afghanistan, Yemen, Kuwait, Bahrain, the Eastern Province of KSA, and Africa (AbZ mentioned Nigeria specifically). Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have close, cooperative ties.  If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, the expeditionary aspect of its foreign policy will become ever more challenging for neighboring states.    POSSIBILITY AND FUTILITY OF SANCTIONS  -------------------------------------    3. (S/NF) Lowey asked what AbZ thought about tougher sanctions against Iran and how the UAE can help with China.  AbZ said the US and its allies "have to decide how to stop Iran" and that the UAE was surprised at the Chinese attitude.  AbZ noted the Emiratis and the Saudis have spoken to the Chinese, and the UAE expressed a willingness to expand its energy ties (Note: AbZ seemed to be indicating that this was intended as a carrot, but he acknowledged the difficulty of supplanting an Iran-China trade relationship that reached $50 billion last year.  End Note.)  4. (S/NF) AbZ urged quick action on tough new sanctions.  The UAE is conscientious in its efforts to enforce existing UNSC sanctions but the Iranians have been able to find other routes, bypassing UAE ports, to import what they need.  AbZ predicted that smart and swift implementation of new sanctions could still be ineffective but said that we must try.    GULF NEIGHBORS FEELING LEFT OUT  -------------------------------    5. (S/NF) AbZ highlighted a growing belief the UAE and the GCC are being left out of our Iran sanctions consultations.  AbZ told Chairwoman Lowey that the P5+1 negotiations with Iran should be expanded to included the GCC.  AbZ said there is a "trust barrier" to full GCC support for US policy, as there is a deep suspicion that the US is proceeding without consulting Gulf allies.  6. (S/NF) AbZ raised (as he likes to do regularly) the 2005 EU package offer to Iran that was briefed to the UAE by the Iranians, not the US or another ally.  Things have improved since then, but "we still need some serious trust building between the US, the EU, and the GCC" on this issue.  The DCM reminded AbZ (and the Codel) that there are extensive and privileged communications between the UAE and the USG on policy towards Iran and on sanctions planning. AbZ acknowledged there was trust from the UAE, but the rest of the GCC had continuing concerns.  "Your problem today is to fix your relations with the GCC, quickly.  A few countries in the region are already dealing with Iran as if they had the bomb."  7. (S/NF) AbZ said GCC states are left wondering what will happen to them in any deal the US and Iran reach through back channel conversations.  He compared the current multilateral conversations over Iran's nuclear program with negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program, asking why North Korea's neighbors are part of the Six Party negotiations, but the GCC is not equally involved in similar conversations about and with Iran.    "WHAT IF?" SCENARIOS  --------------------    8. (S/NF) In response to questions from members of Congress, AbZ said that if Iran goes nuclear others in the region will move forward on the same track and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty will completely break down.  He said a crisis or confrontation in the region would create oil supply problems worldwide.  14 million barrels a day pass through the Strait of Hormuz.  That said, he noted that the US and UAE militaries have plans to keep Hormuz clear.  9. (S) AbZ concluded the meeting with a soliloquy on the importance of a successful peace process between Israel and its neighbors as perhaps the most effective way of reducing Iran's regional influence.  10. (SBU) Members of Congress in attendance: Congresswoman Nita Lowey, Congressman Tom Cole, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congresswoman Donna Edwards. OLSON
S E C R E T ANKARA 000126  SIPDIS  FOR BACKGROUND  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2020 TAGS: PREL PGOV MASS MARR TU AF PK IR IZ IS AMSUBJECT: SECRETARY GATES' TURKEY BILATERAL VISIT: SCENESETTER  Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, Reasons 1.4 (a,b,d)  1. (S) PM Erdogan welcomed President Obama's reiteration of support to the fight against the PKK during the December 7 meeting in the Oval Office, but the Secretary should expect questions about how we will operationalize that commitment as plans to withdraw from Iraq move forward.  A key issue will be how to reduce the gap between the time when the U.S. is no longer able to provide ISR support and when we will be able to help Turkey acquire its own capability.  On missile defense, we will look for the Secretary's help in advancing our work with Turkey to persuade the Turks to allow a key radar system to be based here.  The Turks are struggling to define what they will need in terms of NATO political cover to lessen the high cost - both in terms of domestic politics and in relations with Iran - that Erdogan's government believes it will have to pay should they agree.  2. (S) Although our agenda with Turkey is broad and complex, the following issues are likely to come up during the Secretary's trip:  "Need To Raise" ----------------  - Our commitment to continue sharing real-time intelligence to support Turkey's counter-PKK fight, but caution that the process for Turkey to acquire an armed UAV system from the U.S. will be long and complex. (para 3-5, 14)  - The need for a NATO BMD system with Turkey's participation and the Iranian threat against NATO interests. (para 6-9)  - Appreciation for Turkey's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan, particularly for its new commitments to training security forces. (para 10-11)  - Appreciation for support to OIF/OEF through Turkey's territory, including the Incirlik Cargo Hub; easing transit of non-lethal mil cargo shipments from Iraq to Afghanistan. (para 12)  - Our advocacy support for Raytheon and Sikorsky on sales of air defense systems and utility helicopters (para 13).  "Be Ready To Respond On" ------------------------  - Pressure for direct U.S. milops against the PKK (paras 5)  - Turkish requests for 24/7 Predator coverage of the Turkey-Iraq border to counter PKK operations and activities (para 5).  - Turkish requests for immediate delivery of AH-1W helicopters (para 15)  Counter - PKK Operations: Still Turkey's Top Priority --------------------------------------------- --------  3. (C) Turkey's counter-terrorist efforts against the PKK have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone.  Although the government's renamed National Unity Project (initially called the "Kurdish Opening") was not fully developed when launched and appears to be moving slowly, the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic Kurds in southeast Turkey, dramatically broadened the rights of Kurds to use their own language, and increased educational opportunities as well. It is post's view that the military success against the PKK, supported by our intelligence-sharing operation, has given the civilians the political space to explore this opening and to deal directly with Masoud Barzani and other Iraqi Kurds. Turkish military operations against the PKK continue, however, and on October 6, 2009 Parliament extended the government's mandate to conduct cross-border operations against the PKK in Iraq for another year.  Turkey's leaders have learned from us and from their own experience that only  a whole-of-government approach will succeed against the PKK insurgency.  4. (C) Our November 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was a turning point for the bilateral relationship, and President Obama's declaration before the Turkish Parliament in April 2009 and during his oval office meeting with Erdogan in December 2009 of our continuing commitment to support Turkey's fight against the PKK were warmly welcomed.  Our cooperation has helped to improve the bilateral relationship across the board, particularly by making it difficult for PKK terrorists to use northern Iraq as a safe haven.  We can never reiterate enough our continuing committment, as President Obama did effectively with PM Erdogan in December.  5. (C) Nevertheless, Turkish causalities are still occurring.  Turkey still looks for more support, and will press us for more concrete action before the U.S. completes its withdrawal from Iraq.  CHOD Basbug will likely repeat the GOT's request for laser-designation of targets and/or direct U.S. operations against the PKK.  In December, PM Erdogan also asked POTUS for 24-hour Predator coverage.  At present we provide approximately 12-hour coverage, with an occasional surge to 24 hours to support specific Turkish operations, such as against High Value Targets.  A move to 24-hour coverage is not easy due to resources requirements elsewhere; however, we may be able to provide a few weeks of 24-hour coverage during crucial spring months, and are working with TGS to determine exactly where and when it would be most useful to do so, and what assets the Turkish military would employ if additional UAV support is made available.  Missile Defense ----------------  6. (S) The Turks asked us to postpone a return visit from Ellen Tauscher, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, as they are still considering how best to respond to our request to base an AN/TPY-2 and (potentially) other MD assets in Turkey.  While some of the Turks' technical questions remain unanswered, the key questions are now political.  During his meeting with President Obama, PM Erdogan said that such a system must be implemented in a NATO context to diminish the political cost that his government will likely bear, both in terms of domestic politics and in Turkey's relations with Iran.  The ball is now in the court of the civilian leaders here to determine just "how much NATO" will be enough for them politically; NATOs inability to fund an "interim capability" makes it harder for us to show parallel development of a NATO BMD system with PAA.  Erdogan is concerned that Turkey's participation might later give Israel protection from an Iranian counter-strike.  7. (S) We have made the point to the Turks that a decision to not base the AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey is essentially a decision to opt out of missile defense coverage for Turkey; this would not be a political consequence, but just a fact based on physics and geometry.  It is important to make this point again (gently) with PM Erdogan, but also underscore that we value Turkey's participation and will try to "NATOize" the system, if Turkey will tell us how much NATO would be enough.  8. (S) Behind all this, we fear, is a manifestation of both the Turkish government's, and to some degree the Turkish public's, growing distancing from the Atlanticist world view now that most dangers for Turkey are gone.  While Turks are not naive about Iran (see below), MD places them in a pickle, forcing them to choose between the U.S./West and a Middle East "vocation" - which, while not necessarily includes coddling Iran, requires palpable space between Turkey and "the West."  Iran ----  9. (S) Turkey understands and partially shares U.S. and international concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements, in part due to its dependence on Iran as an energy supplier and as a trade route to Central Asian markets.  It has worked quietly with us to prevent some proliferation-sensitive shipments to and from Iran.  Turkey's top civilian and military officials may have come to the conclusion that a military strike against Iran would be more harmful for Turkey's interests than Iran gaining a nuclear weapons capability; they believe international pressure against Iran only helps to strengthen Ahmadinejad and the hard-liners.  PM Erdogan himself is a particularly vocal skeptic of the U.S. position.  However, Turkey did press Iran (albeit quietly) to accept the P5 plus 1 Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) offer and FM Davutoglu had been personally engaged in trying to rescue the TRR deal, which would have removed a significant portion of Iran's lowly-enriched uranium stockpile.  As a current member of the UNSC, the Turks would be very hesitant to support sanctions against Iran.  We need nevertheless to encourage PM Erdogan to support UN actions if Iran does not comply with Iran's international obligations while underscoring that we view Iran's program as a serious threat to NATO interests in Europe and would like to see a non-military solution (including Turkish participation in NATO BMD).  Afghanistan/Pakistan ----------------------  10. (SBU) Turkey has been a dedicated partner in Afghanistan.  It has commanded ISAF twice since its inception and again took command of RC-Capital in November. Turkey leads PRT Wardak and plans to open a second PRT in Jawzjan (also covering Sar-e-Pol) in mid-2010.  Turkey has sponsored the "Ankara Process" dialogue, one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between Kabul and Islamabad, and is a leading participant in the Friends of Democratic Pakistan.  It hosted a trilateral summit on January 25 and a Afghanistan Regional Summit (including all of Afghanistan's immediate neighbors as well as select other countries including the U.S.) on January 26, just prior to the January 28 London Conference on Afghanistan.  11. (C) Turkey pledged significant aid to both countries: USD 200 million to Afghanistan and USD 100 million to Pakistan, as well as USD 1.5 million to the ANA.  There are 1750 Turkish troops in Afghanistan, and Turkey has four OMLTs currently in Kabul and, since December, pledged two more OMLTs and one POMLT. Because of its culture, history and religious orientation, as well as Foreign Minister Davutoglu's strategic ambition, Turkey is well disposed to act as an agent of the international community's goals in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In 2010, Turkey has pledged to offer 6-8 week trainings for up to a brigade's worth of Afghan military and police personnel in Turkey and will establish a training center in Kabul capable of training up to 600 ANSA personnel at a time.  Retrograde through Turkey -------------------------  12. (S) Turkey's agreement to allow us to use its territory, facilities and airspace has been essential to our ability to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We now look to expand current capabilities to transit materiel from Iraq to join up with the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) to Afghanistan.  CENTCOM logisticians, working with us and our EUCOM Office of Defense Cooperation, seek to take advantage of improved commercial ties between Turkey and Iraq to move non-lethal equipment across Turkey to join the NDN.  We are working to expand our current retrograde agreements to minimize the time and bureaucracy involved, and to expand permissions to allow non-lethal military equipment, including armored transport vehicles.  Advocacy for U.S. Defense Industry ----------------------------------  13.  (C) We much appreciate SecDef's help in advocating for U.S. firms competing for key projects in Turkey, and hope he can raise both Sikorsky's and Raytheon's cases in person. Sikorsky's "International Blackhawk" proposal holds remarkable benefits.  This deal represents a new level of industrial partnership; Sikorsky guarantees that it would build in Turkey - for sale outside of Turkey - one Blackhawk for each one the GOT builds and buys for itself; this is a boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the Turkish economy.  On Air Defense, Raytheon's PAC-3 is competing in a tender for Turkey's air defense.  Raytheon also seeks to take advantage of Turkish industry's ability to co-produce complex systems with us and would produce systems for sale in the UAE and elsewhere.  The benefit to Turkey's economy from such co-production would likely exceed USD 1 billion.  Technically and operationally, there is no system which can compete with the PAC-3, but Turkey's Defense Ministry seeks to broaden competition to include lower-cost options from Russia and even from European producers.  Raytheon often asks us to remind the Turks that a decision on requests for support on Missile Defense should not necessarily affect a decision on PAC-3.  UAV's, Attack Helicopters, and Intel Surge ------------------------------------------  14. (C) Turkey seeks to acquire, on an urgent basis, its own ISR capability to replace the US assets currently being used in anti-PKK operations.  President Obama told PM Erdogan in December that we support Turkey's request to acquire armed Reaper UAVs.  Nevertheless, approval for armed Reapers is complicated due to Hill concerns.  We have explained this to the Turks.  However, even if those could be overcome, the delivery pipeline for these systems is long, and Turkey's leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it.  While we are working to enhance Turkey's ISR capabilities, we have not made this commitment to date.  15. (C) Bad GOT procurement decisions led Turkey to a severe shortage of dual engine, high altitude attack helicopters, which it desperately needs to fight the PKK.  PM Erdogan raised this issue with the President in December 2009; SecDef should expect this issue to be a top priority in meetings with Minister Gonul and with GEN Basbug.  The Turks took SecDef's May 2009 letter to provide up to four AH-1W helicopters each in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as a firm commitment, and now have asked us to advance that date to 2010.  They do not accept our explanation that these aircraft are simply not available from our inventory, as they believe they have -- just like the U.S. -- "troops in contact" and need the close tactical support.  While SecDef should make no commitment, we should also explore whether we can persuade Taiwan to sell or lease some of its own AH-1W aircraft now that Taiwan is taking delivery of Apaches.  Support For The US-Turkey-Iraq "Tripartite Security Dialogue" --------------------------------------------- ----------------  16. (S) SecDef's visit will take place just as USFI's GEN Odierno will have left.  We expect that GEN Odierno's visit will give a political boost to the U.S.-Turkey-Iraq Tripartite Security talks.  Turkey's civilian leaders are taking heat from their domestic political opposition for pressing the "Kurdish Opening" while casualties from PKK attacks continue.  They hope to use GEN Odierno's visit to show that their whole-of-government approach against PKK insurgency is producing results and that it has the support of senior USG officials in Iraq.  17.  (S) Trilateral meetings continue regularly and a new Tripartite operational office in Erbil, established to share counter-PKK intelligence was established over the summer. The most recent tri-lat meeting took place in Baghdad in December, followed by a joint Turkey-Iraq visit in Erbil. The Turks remain frustrated that, in their view, the KRG is not doing enough to combat the PKK.  The Turks remain shy in sharing intelligence data; they are not convinced that they  can trust Iraqi/Kurdish individuals to keep information concerning operations secret.  Turkish officials have become more strident in their calls for KRG officials to take action against the PKK. The cooperation that does exist is a step in the right direction; however, it will need to improve significantly prior to the U.S. pullout of Iraq.  CHOD Basbug and PM Ergodan want the U.S. to put more pressure on the Iraqis - and particularly Masoud Barzani - to take actions to cut PKK supply and logistics lines in northern Iraq.  We should stress the need for more trust and collaboration between Turkey and Iraq, eventually on Turkish CBOs.  Absent greater cooperation, we could see significant bilateral problems post-2011, to include Iraqi claims of Turkey's violation of its sovereign territory.  Northern Iraq --------------  18. (C) Turkey will not consider any alternative to the political unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, but has become more flexible on how it engages "the local authorities of northern Iraq" (how Turkey refers officially to the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG)).  Turkey's policy remains focused on the government in Baghdad, but its outreach to the KRG is expanding.  This outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of Turkish products and investments in the KRG's healthy economy.  Armenia -------  19. (S) The signing of the Protocols to reestablish Turkish-Armenian relations and open the common border in Zurich on October 10 was a landmark for the region.  However, neither Turkey nor Armenia have taken steps toward ratification; the GOT argues that progress toward withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani provinces surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh is a pre-condition.  (Note:  This was not/not part of the agreement, and not a position the U.S. supports.  End note.)  Future relations will nevertheless still be heavily linked to the 1915 "Armenian genocide" issue.  Any U.S. determination of the events of 1915 as "genocide" would set off a political firestorm in Turkey, and the effect on our bilateral relationship -- including political, military, and commercial aspects -- would be devastating.  Israel ------  20. (C) While the Foreign Ministry and the Turkish General Staff agree with us that a strong Turkey-Israel relationship is essential for regional stability, PM Erdogan has sought to shore up his domestic right flank through continued populist rhetoric against Israel and its December 2008 Gaza operation.  His outburst at Davos and the last-minute cancellation of Israel's participation in the Fall 2009 Anatolian Eagle Exercise (a multilateral Air Force exercise which had US, Turkey, Italy, and Israel as planned participants) were the most noticeable examples of this rhetoric, which we and his staff have sought to contain.  The latest incident, a snub in early January of the Turkish Ambassador by Israeli Deputy Foreign Minster Danny Ayalon, almost caused the GOT to both recall its Ambassador and cancel the visit of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak.  However, the very public row was resolved with an Israeli apology and Barak's visit on January 17 helped to stem the downward spiral for now.  Nevertheless, we assess that Erdogan is likely to continue anti-Israel remarks and the issues will continue to cast a shadow on the TU-IS bilateral relationship.  Political Environment ---------------------  21. (C) PM Erdogan's Islamist-leaning Justice and Development (AK) Party remains Turkey's strongest political party,  but its poll numbers are slumping, and it continues to fear an erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist  parties.  Civilian-military relations remain complex.  Chief of Staff General Basbug has worked out a modus vivendi with PM Erdogan, but the long-running struggle between Turkey's secularists (with the Army as its champion) and Islamists (represented by the government) naturally puts them at odds. Erdogan has the clear upper hand, a fact with which Basbug has seemingly learned to live.  Alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both Erdogan and Basbug and their respective underlings.  Public trust in the military is starting to decline, the result of several very public on-going investigations into the alleged planning against the government.

Jeffrey, Reasons 1.4 (b,d)  Summary -------  1. (C)  Reports of coup plots against PM Erdogan's Islamist-leaning government have been a staple of the Turkish media since 2007.  Despite protests by Turkey's top brass that there is no substance to the allegations, a growing percentage of the population believes that at least some elements within the military have been plotting to undermine or even overthrow the AKP-led government.  The coup allegations have served as fodder for the Ergenekon prosecution team and some of the plots have been included in the formal indictments against senior retired military officers.  The net result of these allegations has been a gradual erosion of the public trust toward the military.  The latest reports related to the "Sledgehammer" plan (ref a) come at a time when the government is preparing the process of amending the constitution to allow military personnel to be tried in civilian courts (ref b).  With the pro-Islamist media fanning the flames and the Turkish General Staff's consistently inadequate responses to each allegation, public opinion is becoming less unquestioning vis a vis the military; this could help strengthen AKP's position as it mulls steps to amend the Turkish constitution in order to affect a shift in the civil-military balance in its favor, although AKP,s own support has eroded considerably over the past year.  End Summary.  Coup Chronicles: A Review -------------------------  2. (C) Over the course of the last two-and-a-half years, the Turkish military has faced a number of allegations of coup plotting having occurred within its ranks, especially in the 2003 to 2004 period.  These allegations have increased in tempo over the last year, with the liberal daily "Taraf" ("Side") -- whose tagline is: "To Think is to Take Sides" -- leading the charge in breaking many of the often-sensational stories that draw on leaked information from unnamed military or judicial sources.  (Comment: Taraf owner Basar Arslan has publicly dismissed claims that Taraf is secretly funded by the Fetullah Gulen movement. End Comment).  Paras 8-14 outline the key allegations that have surfaced in the Turkish media since 2007.  Common Threads --------------  3. (C) One of the common threads in this review is that the alleged plans are all variations on a theme: they all involve efforts to sow chaos or foment public opposition to the AKP and to create the conditions for a military intervention. None of the alleged plots involve a direct military takeover (Comment: The military's problem in such a scenario is that it knows its interventions and coup plots are not popular among the population.  The last "successful" coup -- in 1980 -- occurred in response to a massive breakdown of public order as armed political, ethnic and criminal gangs engaged in violent attacks.  The core accusation in these current scenarios is the allegation that the military this time would foment the violence themselves, blaming radical, Islamic and other groups, and then step in to "restore order" after the government fails to do so.  End Comment.)  4. (C) Another common theme is that all the allegations put the military in an almost impossible position of having to prove a negative -- that it did not engage in the planning actions alleged by the media reports -- to a public, some parts of whom are increasingly suspicious of the military with each new claim.  While we may never know the extent to which each of these allegations are true, it is clear from statements by former Turkish General Staff Chief Gen. Ozkok that, at the very least, there was serious consideration given within the military in 2003 to 2004 to overthrow the  ANKARA 00000150  002 OF 004   AKP-led government.  Polling Data and Net Effect Thus Far ------------------------------------  5. (C) The series of allegations has been eroding the public's confidence in the military.  While the military still enjoys strong support among the public -- one poll by Genar Polling in November 2009 indicated that 80.6 percent of those surveyed viewed the military as the institution that inspires most confidence, 15 points above the presidency, which came in second -- this support has slipped.  A poll conducted by A Polling in January indicated that while public support for the military was around 90 percent before the Ergenekon investigations began, public support has dropped to 63.4 percent.  Ipsos KMG also published a poll in early January indicating the trust in the military had declined from 85 to 90 percent before the Ergenekon allegations, to 73 percent in late 2009.  Another poll conducted in early January by Turkish polling firm MetroPoll, before the "Sledgehammer" story broke, found that 30 percent of respondents in the January poll indicated that their trust in the military has decreased.  55 percent of respondents also believed that "there is a group within the military which is preparing to stage a coup," a rise of 7 percent from July 2009 figures.  Despite the decreasing confidence in the military indicated by one of three respondents, 62 percent of respondents did not believe that the military would stage another coup.  6. (C) Secularists who question the motives of the AKP and the timing of each new coup plot allegation are convinced that most of the claims are a combination of fabrication and manipulation of actual military documents and that there is a systematic campaign to erode the trust of the military.  TGS chief Basbug has led this charge, calling the series of media stories an "asymmetric attack" targeting the Turkish Armed Forces.  Even as he denounced the media reports, however, Basbug has also clearly committed the military to supporting democracy and the rule of law and has stated that the era of coups in Turkey is over (ref. b).  Comment: Stage is Set for Constitutional Reform --------------------------------------------- --  7. (C) With the Constitutional Court's unanimous decision to overturn a law extending civilian jurisdiction over military personnel for crimes including coup plotting (ref c), the government has announced that it plans to seek a referendum to change Turkey's constitution to affect this change.  Many of the other possible constitutional reforms being considered by the government -- such as changing the structure of the Constitutional Court and limiting clauses often used to justify the prosecution of nationalist Kurds and Islamist politicians -- would attract the opposition of the military and its political supporters.  The apparent rise in distrust among the Turkish populace toward the military, particularly after "Sledgehammer," which allegedly would have targeted average Turks in an arbitrary manner, could work to the AKP's advantage as it looks to further shift the balance of power in civ-mil relations through constitutional reforms, although AKP,s own standing is greatly diminished from only one year ago.  COUP DIARIES AND ALLEGED PLOTS ------------------------------  8. (SBU) Excerpts of diary entries dating back to 2003 and 2004 allegedly belonging to then-Naval Forces Commander Admiral Ozden Ornek were first published by the weekly "Nokta" in 2007 (Comment: The magazine was closed shortly after it published these documents.  End Comment).  The diary entries -- popularly known as the "Coup Diaries" -- laid out in detail discussions among senior military officers of steps the military needed to take to unseat the Islamist-leaning Justice and Development Party, which came to power in 2002. "Sarikiz" ("Blondie") was the initial coup plan developed by then-Jandarma Commander General Eruygur, which involved a coordinated effort among the military and other elements of Turkey's secular elite, to effect the removal of the AKP from power.  The plot allegedly had the support of all the other force commanders at the time (Land Forces Commander General Aytac Yalman, Air Forces Commander General Ibrahim Firtina,  ANKARA 00000150  003 OF 004   and Naval Forces Commander Admiral Ornek).  Then-Turkish General Staff (TGS) Chief General Hilmi Ozkok reportedly rejected the coup proposal, which led Eruygur and former First Army Commander General Hursuit Tolon to develop other plots entitled "Ayisigi" ("Moonlight") and "Yakamoz" ("Phosphorescence"), which provided operational details of a coup that would involve the removal of General Ozkok and the restructuring of the military.  Other related plans related to the plot with code names "Eldiven" ("Glove") and "Demiryumruk" ("Iron Fist") reportedly provided more details about steps to be taken in the aftermath of a successful coup.  9. (SBU) These plots were included in the Ergenekon prosecutors' second indictment in March 2009, and provided the legal basis for the detention of retired generals Eruygur and Tolon (who were initially arrested in July 2008 and were detained without formal charges until the release of the indictment).  Eruygur has been identified as the alleged head of Ergenekon while Tolon is considered a leading member. Retired force commanders Firtina, Ornek, and Yalman were interviewed by Ergenekon prosecutors in early December 2009, but have not been charged; Firtina publicly denied involvement in any coup plots.  According to press accounts, General Ozkok acknowledged during testimony to Ergenekon prosecutors in April 2009 that most of the contents of the "coup diaries" were true and that he was aware of plans to overthrow the government among elements within the military but did not have hard evidence to move against the plotters.  "KAFES" (OPERATION CAGE) ------------------------  10. (SBU) This plot involved senior navy flag officers and was uncovered during the April 2009 search of the home of retired Navy Lieutenant Commander Levent Bektas, an Ergenekon suspect, and was revealed by Taraf in November 2009.  CDs found in Bektas's home reportedly revealed a plot drafted in March 2009 headed by then-Sea Area North Commander Vice Admiral Feyyaz Ogutcu (now retired) and current Sea Area South Commander Kadir Sardic.  The plot included plans to assassinate prominent non-Muslim figures and blame these attacks on the AKP in order to increase foreign and domestic pressure for the AKP to step down.  Media reports indicated that the plan included setting off a bomb planted at the submarine exhibit at the Rahmi Koc Museum in Istanbul and using women to obtain information from other navy officers and entrap them into supporting Ergenekon.  Bektas has been under arrest as part of the Ergenekon probe, as well as several active duty officers, including Lt. Col. Halil Ozsarac, and colonels Levent Gulmen and Mucahit Erakyol. Thus far, neither Ogutcu or Sardic has been questioned about this plot.  11. (SBU) Taraf reporter Mehmet Baransu, who broke the news about "Kafes," received an award from the Turkish Journalists Association for his "Kafes" reporting, but was also investigated for violating the confidentiality of an ongoing criminal investigation.  While those charges have been dropped, there is an ongoing case against Baransu and Taraf manager Adnan Demir for "openly insulting the military institution of the state," in violation of Section 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.  ACTION PLAN AGAINST FUNDAMENTALISM (refs d and e) --------------------------------------------- ----  12. (SBU) Photocopies of the alleged "Action Plan Against Fundamentalism" were published by Taraf as a front-page story in June 2009.  The plan outlined a psychological operations campaign to discredit the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as other "sources of fundamentalism," including the Fetullah Gulen movement.  The action plan was allegedly drafted by Naval Infantry Colonel Dursun Cicek in 2009 under orders of then-Deputy CHOD Igsiz, with the knowledge and tacit approval of General Basbug himself.  The TGS denied the existence of such a plan, with General Basbug dismissing the photocopied documents as "a piece of paper." The allegation came roaring back to life in November 2009 when Taraf claimed that it had received -- from an anonymous military officer -- the original copy of the plan with Cicek's "wet" signature.  Cicek was detained in July 2009 for his role in drafting the plan, but was released due to lack of evidence.  He was again detained and interviewed by  ANKARA 00000150  004 OF 004   prosecutors in November 2009, but was again released without charges.  ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST DEPUTY PM (ref f) --------------------------------------------  13. (SBU) On December 19, two active duty Turkish special forces officers were arrested by the police near the residence of Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc.  This led to allegations that the military was planning to assassinate Arinc.  As a result, the civilian judiciary issued a court order to search the offices of the officers which are located at the TGS Special Forces Mobilization Command.  After initial refusal by the military to allow a broader search of the premises, CHOD Basbug, along with Land Forces Commander (and likely successor to Basbug as CHOD in August 2010) General Kosaner, met with PM Erdogan on December 26. Following this meeting, a second search warrant was issued to allow a judge to review the classified documents stored at the Mobilization Command headquarters.  These searches are ongoing, but to date, the investigators have not announced any discovery of evidence that would support the claims of an assassination plot against Arinc.  "BALYOZ" (SLEDGEHAMMER) (ref a) -------------------------------  14. (SBU) "Sledgehammer," the latest alleged plot, was allegedly drafted in 2003 by the Turkish First Army, under its then-commander Gen. Cetin Dogan.  The plan, which has been denied by both the military and retired General Dogan, involved false-flag bombing of mosques and efforts to provoke a military crisis with Greece in order to create the conditions for a military intervention.  The plan, as revealed by "Taraf" on January 20 -- a day before the Constitutional Court's decision overturning the law allowing civilian jurisdiction over certain offenses committed by the military -- allegedly included lists of names of politicians and journalists to be arrested, as well as names of politicians who would serve in a new government after the removal of the AKP.

S E C R E T ANKARA 000251  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/16/2020 TAGS: PARM PREL PTER TUSUBJECT: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES'S MEETINGS WITH TURKISH MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND CHIEF OF THE TURKISH GENERAL STAFF, FEBRUARY 6, 2010  Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey for reason 1.4 (b, d)  1. (S/NF) Summary:  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) met with Turkish Minister of National Defense Mehmet Vecdi Gonul (MND Gonul) and the Chief of the Turkish Genral Staff General Ilker Basbug (Gen Basbug) in separate meetings during his bilateral visit to Ankara on February 6, 2010. SecDef thanked Gonul and Basbug for Turkey's valuable contributions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Gonul stressed Turkey's important role in Afghanistan as a Muslim country in the Alliance and Basbug hailed continuing U.S. and Turkish support to Afghan National Security Force training and assistance to the Pakistani Armed Forces.  SecDef and Gonul discussed the importance of a Turkish role in European Missile Defense.  On combating the PKK in Turkey, SecDef agreed with Basbug that the key to further progress is greater Iraqi cooperation with Turkey. SecDef highlighted to Gonul opportunities to increase military capability and gain economic benefits through choosing Sikorsky helicopters or Raytheon Patriot PAC-3 systems in ongoing tenders.  ---------------------- Bilateral Relationship ----------------------  2. (C) MND Gonul stressed the importance of the SecDef's visit, noting that it built on the Prime Minister's December meeting in Washington with President Obama in December. SecDef agreed on the importance of the bilateral relationship, and recalled that Turkish-American solidarity extended from the Korean War through the present in Afghanistan.  SecDef said he believed that Turkey was undervalued as an Ally by many Europeans.  ----------- Afghanistan -----------  3. (S/NF) In both meetings SecDef conveyed U.S. appreciation for Turkey's contributions to Afghanistan -- including providing troops, OMLTs, POMLTs, a PRT, commanding RC-Capital, providing access through the Incirlik air base, and allowing the transit of non-lethal goods to Afghanistan through Turkish air space.  Regarding Turkey's contributions to ISAF, GEN Basbug said that "we are trying to do our best" with the PRT in Wardak province and command of RC-Capital. He observed that the hardest aspect of the fight against the Taliban was differentiating between the real Taliban and those that merely helped or supported the Taliban or even indigenous forces not aligned with the Taliban.  However, Basbug was hopeful that Allies could win over some of those who were sympathetic to the Taliban through a reintegration strategy.  4. (S/NF) Gonul emphasized that Turkey had a "special connection" with the people of Afghanistan due to common Islamic roots.  Turkey's involvement in ISAF offered a way of refuting insurgents' attempts to use Islam as ideological justification for their efforts.  SecDef agreed that having Muslim soldiers participate in ISAF drives home the fact that the fight in Afghanistan is not against Islam but rather against terrorists who "pervert Islam."  5. (S/NF) Basbug was upbeat about prospects for success in Afghanistan, noting that the positive tone of GEN McChrystal's brief at the NATO CHODs conference had inspired more optimism among his colleagues than had his original September brief on his assessment.  SecDef said he agreed with McChrystal's latest assessment that the situation was serious but no longer deteriorating, but warned that no one should exaggerate how well things were going.  At the Istanbul Ministerial as well, he said, there had clearly been a change in mood among the Ministers present.  Significantly, Defense Minister Wardak had told him that for the first time he had begun to hope for a successful outcome in Afghanistan.   6. (S/NF) Basbug described the terrorist attacks in Kabul on January 18th as serious, but said that the ANSF response ultimately offered an "outstanding" example of how to manage a very complex operation.  Nine terrorists were killed and two were captured, and the terrorists did not ultimately achieve their objectives.  Describing post-attack operations as "a cause for optimism," Basbug said that the Afghan forces involved showed they were motivated, well disciplined, and well prepared for the fight.  Basbug then reviewed Turkey's plans for training the ANA and the ANP, stressing that the   priority was to provide unit training both in Turkey and in Afghanistan.  So far, he said, Turkey had trained three Afghan companies and would open a training center in Kabul to do battalion-level training soon.  -------- Pakistan --------  7.  (S/NF) Basbug also raised Pakistan, recalling his October visit at the invitation of General Kayani.  During his visit to Swat province he had witnessed a hundred-fold improvement in security since his previous visit, citing the return of civilian populations to the region as a clear success for Pakistani forces.  Sec Def agreed, observing that the degree of success by Pakistani forces ran counter to all of our intelligence predictions.  8. (S/NF) Basbug highlighted the TGF's support for Pakistan's armed forces - especially on logistics and maintenance of equipment, including spare parts for their Air Force.  He said that although overall relationships with Pakistan were sometimes difficult, cooperation remained solid at the military level.  ---------------- Counterterrorism ----------------  9.  (S/NF) Basbug raised the issue of Turkey's protracted fight against the PKK, highlighting progress over the past year due to the elimination of key leaders, divisions within PKK ranks, and dwindling morale of PKK fighters.  This progress, Basbug said, was the result of increased U.S.-Turkish cooperation since the end of 2007, including intelligence sharing, provision of ISR support, and use U.S. UAV assets in Northern Iraq.  Basbug concluded by requesting additional support from the United States government, Iraqi government, and KRG.  Drawing a parallel to U.S. actions in the cross-border region of Pakistan, Basbug said that in order to continue to eliminate the PKK threat, Turkey needs more support from all stakeholders to pursue the top PKK leadership.  10.  (S/NF) Addressing Turkey's outstanding Reaper UAV requests, SecDef reaffirmed to Basbug that the U.S. is committed to the sale of Reapers to Turkey, but offered the caveat that the sale would first have to be approved by Congress.  SecDef added that the Pentagon is also looking at additional reconnaissance capabilities in addition to the Predators currently flown by the U.S.  The U.S. he said, is considering some UAVs with shorter dwell times, which have proven to be effective in Iraq.  Regarding current UAV support -- which already provides an average of 16-17 hours of coverage daily -- SecDef said that Gen Odierno will look at ways to surge up to 24-hour coverage when necessary, e.g. for operations involving high-value targets.  11. (S/NF) SecDef emphasized that Turkey's dialogue with KRG was very important.  In his meeting the previous week with KRG President Barzani, SecDef said he pressed him once again to work with the PKK to persuade them to abandon violence. Basbug agreed and said Turkey's dialogue with the KRG was particularly important as a measure to persuade the KRG to take a more proactive approach to the PKK.  12. (S/NF) Basbug expressed concern about the U.S. drawdown of forces from Iraq, lamenting that while Turkey has been successful in reducing the PKK threat, it will be difficult to finish off the threat after U.S forces leave.  He concluded that Turkey would need to "finish the problem" before the U.S. drawdown was complete.  ------------------------ Missile Defense and Iran ------------------------  13. (S/NF) MND Gonul said he considered the new US Phased Adaptive approach better than the previous Administration's approach, since the previous system did not cover Turkey. SecDef agreed, noting that the Polish and Romanian agreement to host SM-3 missiles.  He further emphasized that without a radar based in Turkey, significant areas in the eastern part of the country would not be covered by the system.  14. (S/NF) Gonul told SecDef that discussions about the radar were ongoing within the Turkish government and inquired about   what alternate sites the U.S. was considering.  SecDef responded that other countries in Southeast Europe might be interested in hosting the radar, but reiterated that Turkey was the optimal site.  SecDef explained that one of the reasons why he had embraced the new administration's approach was that it provided protection for Allies and troops earlier than the previous program without reducing protection of the U.S.  15. (S/NF) Turning to Iran, Gonul cited the enrichment program and acknowledged that Ankara is "concerned about the Iranian threat," but said that the international community does not yet have evidence that there is a weapons program. Gonul said that even though Turkey does not expect an attack from Iran, the threat from Iran to Turkey's European allies would make an air defense capability important. (Comment: His acknowledgement of an Iranian threat to Europe diverges from previous Turkish statements underplaying such a threat.)  He repeated that the system would be designed to defend all of Europe, and not solely Turkey.  16. (S/NF) SecDef counseled that if Iran goes forward with a nuclear weapons program, other states in the region were likely to proliferate as well.  Additionally, there was a good chance Israelis would at some point decide that military action was necessary.  As Turkey would inevitably be unable to sit out on any conflict in the region, it is important to be prepared militarily and Ankara should not hesitate to acquire defensive systems, even as the international community works to stop Iran's efforts.  -------------------- Acquisition Advocacy --------------------  17. (C//NF) During his meeting with Gonul, SecDef advised that Turkey had opportunities to increase its military capabilities while gaining economic benefits by selecting U.S. companies in currently open tenders.  First, Sikorsky, was prepared to guarantee that for every helicopter produced in Turkey and bought by Turkey, Sikorsky would produce a second helicopter in Turkey for export.  SecDef explained that in addition to providing modern equipment for Turkey, this offer would provide hundreds of millions of dollars in export revenue.  Gonul replied that Sikorsky had told him Turkey was the largest consumer of Sikorsky helicopters after the U.S. and that Turkey already was buying 70 Sea Hawk helicopters (as well as 14 heavy lift helos (CH-47s) from Boeing).  The tender for the new project had been running for two years and the short list included Sikorsky and an Italian company.  Gonul believes Sikorsky has a good chance to win.  18. (C/NF) A second opportunity involves the co-production of Raytheon PAC-3 Patriot systems.  Demand for these systems in the Gulf States could potentially yield hundreds of millions of dollars in export revenue.  SecDef stressed that "nothing can compete with the PAC-3 when it comes to capabilities." These opportunities are a chance for Turkey to earn revenue while simultaneously enhancing capabilities and creating jobs.  19.  (C/NF) Gonul said this competition right now was between the U.S., Russia and China, but noted that French MoD Morin had indicated in Istanbul that the French would also make a bid including co-production arrangements.  Gonul observed that as this was an expensive project and he had limited familiarity with the PAC-3: he needed to be careful to make the right choice. SecDef pointed out that the Raytheon package would be easier to integrate with the command and control of the U.S. and others using the same system.  -------------------- Joint Strike Fighter --------------------  20. (C) Gonul said Turkey was pleased to be part of the joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and noted his belief that it was important for Turkey to have maintenance facilities in Turkey.  SD remarked that because the program was recently restructured, cost estimates were now realistic.  SecDef noted he had directed the JSF program manager to put additional funding in the FY2011 and FY2012 budget for JSF. However, because of contractor delays, the timeline had slipped about a year.  In conclusion, Gonul raised Turkey's F-16 modernization program and expressed concern that new upgrades precluded Turkish access to computer systems and software modification previously allowed.  Turkish Under   Secretary for Industry Bayar told SecDef he would pursue this issue in greater detail with Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Ash Carter.  21. (U) SecDef has cleared this cable.  Drafted by OSD staff. Jeffrey             "Visit Ankara's Classified Web Site at http://www.intelink.s gov.gov/wiki/Portal:Turkey"

(C) Summary:  On February 22 police detained 47 retired and active-duty military officers, including 17 flag-grade officers for -- according to press reports -- their alleged involvement in coup plots dating back to 2003-2004.  Although coverage of the detentions blanketed the press, neither the Turkish General Staff (TGS) nor the government appear publicly outraged (in the case of TGS) or congratulatory (the governing Justice and Development Party) by the actions. There has been no official statement from the TGS, and PM Ergodan took a back seat by stating that the police were simply acting on order from the judiciary.  (His attack dog Deputy PM Arinc was more polemical.)  CHOD GEN Basbug announced that he has postponed imminent travel to Egypt, and late on February 23 called an emergency meeting with his four-star generals and admirals.  Prosecutors have now detained all of the force commanders from the 2003-2004 period with the exception of former CHOD Hilmi Ozkok and former Turkish Land Forces Commander Aytac Yalman.  End summary.  Unprecedented Arrests... -------------------------  2.  (SBU) On February 22 nearly 50 retired and current military officers (and one NCO) were detained, likely for their alleged connections to the "Sledgehammer" (Balyoz) investigations.  The homes and offices of many retired flag officers were also searched and police seized and removed documents for further inspection.  Among those detained were four active duty admirals and 17 retired generals, including:  --Ergin Saygun:  Former Deputy CHOD (2006-2008) and 1st Army Commander (2008-2009).  Saygun is very well-known to the U.S.; he was our primary coordinator on anti-terrorism issues for many years, and had accompanied PM Erdogan during his November 2007 visit to Washington.  --Ibrahim Firtina:  Former Air Force Chief from 2003-2005. Firtina was questioned in December 2009 by the Ergenekon prosecutors and has been implicated in the press for his role in the Sledgehammer Operation.  --Cetin Dogan: Former 1st Army Commander (2002-2004).  --Ozden Ornek:  Former Navy Chief (2003 - 2005).  Ornek's diary, which allegedly details discussions among senior military officers to start a coup between 2003-2005, is being used by prosecutors as their primary source of evidence. Ornek was also questioned by Ergenekon prosecutors in December 2009.  --Engin Alan:  LtG (retired).  --Suha Tanyeli:  BG (retired). Tanyeli was head of the TGS Strategic Research Center (SAREM).  3.  (C) The operation itself appears to have been well coordinated, as detentions and searches took place simultaneously in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Diyarbakir, Hatay, Kocaeli, and Bodrum.  There have been no official pronouncements regarding the reasons for the operation, although the press widely suspects that the arrests are in connection with the 2003 Sledgehammer plan (which allegedly included a plan to overthrow the AKP government (ref B) and a separate plot known as "Operation Cage" (ref A)).  Press reports state that many of the detained individuals' signatures were found on "Sledgehammer" documents.  The majority of individuals, according to the press, are being interrogated in Istanbul.  ...But So What? ----------------  4. (C) Despite the press fury, reaction from TGS and the government has been minimal.  TGS has yet to make a official statement.  However, TGS CHOD General Ilker Basbug postponed his official travel to Egypt -- an extraordinary and  ANKARA 00000294  002 OF 003   unprecedented step -- and late on February 23 called an emergency meeting with his four-star generals and admirals. When asked about the arrests PM Erdogan, in Spain for a state visit, told reporters that the police were acting on the order of the judiciary.  Although a few "usual suspects" inflammatory statements from the opposition -- such as Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal's statement that the arrests made it feel was "as if Turkey was under occupation" -- made it into the press initially, overall press reactions were overshadowed the following day by other news stories.  Markets opened up this morning, and business continues as usual.  Bad for TGS?  Good for AKP? ----------------------------  5. (C) This is the largest "round-up" of military officers to date; the lack of an immediate reaction from TGS may suggest that the (current) military leadership is either fully willing to allow this investigation and the democratic process to continue unimpeded, or is waiting for AKP to hang itself on unfounded allegations.  The military remains deeply unhappy about AKP's governance and is enraged at the steady campaign to erode the military's standing in Turkish society.  To date, prosecutors have now detained all of the senior military commanders from the 2003-2004 period with the exception of former CHOD Hilmi Ozkok and former Land Forces Commander Aytac Yalman.  And although the TGS seemed to be caught off balance and therefore was unwilling to speak up yesterday in strong opposition to these ongoing investigations, it seems unlikely that it will remain silent.   6. (C) AKP appears to have concluded that it gains politically from the arrest of military officers.  Having perhaps nevertheless learned from past experiences, PM Erdogan was shielded from what could have been outraged criticism by secularists by conveniently being outside of the country.  His absence also did not allow for any publicized "urgent" meeting with CHOD Basbug, as has happened in the past.  Deputy PM Bulent Arinc's statements appeared designed to spin these developments as yet another example of how "times have changed" in Turkey and how the country is merely going through a "normalization" period.  7. (C) The next few days will prove interesting and possibly pivotal.  The judiciary has four days to either turn the detentions into formal arrests or release the individuals. If formal charges are brought, TGS will be forced to respond.  Likewise, a lack of substantive evidence will rebound on the Government, and will give credence to accusations that the long-running Ergenekon investigation has a deeper and more insidious design:  to undermine AKP's secular opposition.  8. (C) Some knowledgeable embassy officers see this latest step as a more serious provocation that could trigger some type of unpredictable military reaction.  We will see.  COMMENT --------  9.  (C) To repeat the facts on this whole "Ergenekon" set of events:  a.  There is some "fire" behind the smoke.  The military obviously has plans to intervene if necessary in political affairs and can cite the 1982 constitution, endorsed by the population per referendum, which gives the military a key role in "overseeing" democratic governments' adherence to Ataturkist principles -- largely defined as by the military and its friends in the bureaucracy and judiciary.  b.  PM Erdogan (supported by the EU and even many anti-Erdogan Turkes who want to see the military out of politics) legitimately wants to rein in this "droit de regard" status.  c.  But PM Erdogan realizes that elections are coming up, and that he did relatively poorly in last year's elections (38%) but brilliantly in 2007 (47% AKP win) when he played off the military's counter-productive threats.  d.  Thus much of this is electoral poiltics, albeit of a  ANKARA 00000294  003 OF 003   "below the belt" contact sport variety.  e.  All this is exacerbated by the thuggish authoritarian behavior of the police and judiciary (reflecting prevailing tendencies in this society, including in the military).  In the U.S. a prosecutor or detective would simply have visited the generals in question to post questions.  "Invites" to the precinct, reading of rights, indictments, arrests, and detentions follow only after the amassing of evidence and clear indications of a case winnable in court.  Not here. Anyone even suspected of "having information" is hauled before the police (armed with automatic weapons), and humiliated before the press.  It's always been that way; now it's happening also to the top brass and their friends.  f.  Up to now, however, most of those so publicly humiliated are eventually released due to patent innocence,a lack of evidence (as in the recent "Special Forces officers planning Arinc's assassination" caper -- ref A) or because the judiciary throws the whole process out (i.e. the law making military officers subject to civilian courts -- ref C).  g.  But every day is a new one here, and no one can be certain where this whole choreography will fall out of whack.  Then, look out.

Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4 (b,d)  1. (C) Summary:  During February 18 "Shared Vision and Structured Dialogue" meetings in Ankara,   Turkish MFA Undersecretary Sinirlioglu:  -- Appealed for "simultaneity" between Armenian Protocols ratification and the Minsk Process; -- Registered increasing GoT dissatisfaction with Iraqi PM Malaki; -- Expressed hope USF-I CG Odierno's engagement would elicit substantive cooperation from the KRG against the terrorist PKK; -- Urged higher profile USG involvment in the Cyprus reunification talks, and; -- Confirmed GoT interest in further dialogue on missile defense.  End Summary.  IRAN ----  2. (C) Burns strongly urged Sinirlioglu to support action to convince the Iranian government it is on the wrong course. Sinirliolgu reaffirmed the GoT's opposition to a nuclear Iran; however, he registered fear about the collateral impact military action might have on Turkey and contended sanctions would unite Iranians behind the regime and harm the opposition.  Burns acknowledged Turkey's exposure to the economic effects of sanctions as a neighbor to Iran, but reminded Sinirlioglu Turkish interests would suffer if Israel were to act militarily to forestall Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons or if Egypt and Saudi Arabia were to seek nuclear arsenals of their own.  He said the international community's patience with Iran had been met with the Iranian refusal, since October, to work with the P5-plus-1, the clandestine enrichment facility near Qom and Tehran's recent decison to enrich its low-enriched uranium to 20%.  The IAEA's creative proposal to fabricate new fuel assemblies for the Tehran Research Reactor had stumbled on a technically unfeasible Iranian counter-offer for a simultaneous exchange in Iran of Iranian fuel for fuel assemblies.  Carefully constructed sanctions, Burns argued, targeting the increasingly pervasive economic power of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, would convey the international community's unity and determination.  "We'll keep the door open to engagement," he stressed.  A visibly disheartened Sinirlioglu conceded a unified message is important.  He acknowledged the countries of the region perceive Iran as a growing threat:  "Alarm bells are ringing even in Damascus."  ARMENIA -------  3. (C) Sinirlioglu appealed for "simultaneity" between Armenian Protocols ratification and the Minsk Process.  He emphasized "a strong reaction" against the protocols among ruling party MPs had to be overcome before the government would hazard a ratification effort.  He warned Congressional passage of an Armenian genocide resolution would "complicate" his government's domestic political calculations regarding ratification.  He said if something acceptable to Azerbaijani President Aliyev can found, then "we can move" the protocols forward.  Sinirlioglu suggested Azerbaijan and Armenia's announcement of an agreed framework for Minsk Group progress would provide the GoT with the necessary political cover. Burns inquired about the prospect for progress on a natural gas deal between Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Sinirlioglu implied  ANKARA 00000302  002 OF 005   Aliyev is holding an agreement hostage to Turkey's handling of the protocols:  "He doesn't trust us."  IRAQ ----  4. (C) Sinirlioglu registered the GoT's increasing dissatisfaction with PM Malaki and fear that he is tending "to get out of control."  "He is preoccupied with his political survival;" nevertheless, Sinirlioglu continued, the GoT is in frequent contact with him.  The MFA hosted Maliki advisors Sadiq al Rikabi and Tariq al Najmi to meetings 10 days prior.  Sinirlioglu lamented Iran's efforts to influence the election.  He noted Saudi Arabia is also "throwing around money" among the political parties in Iraq because it is unwilling to accept the inevitability of Shia dominance there.  "We want a free, transparent and fair election," he said, "we need to forestall a deepening of the sectarian divide."  5. (C) After the March 7 elections, Sinirlioglu said, Turkey would initiate an effort to connect Iraqi gas fields to the Turkish grid via a 300 kilometer pipeline, costing USD 500 million.  He asserted the pipeline could begin pumping within two years.  He alleged Iranian opposition to the pipeline because most of Iraq's gas fields are in Kurdish and Sunni areas.  Sinirlioglu advocated a second pipeline that would give Iraqi oil an alternative to the Gulf as a route to Europe once the country is able to meet its OPEC quota.  He asserted the piplines' construction would pull the several Iraqi communities together into a common project.  The creation of new "common assets," he said, could be more important for its politically unifying effect than its economic impact.  6. (C) Sinirlioglu registered his appreciation for USF-I Commanding General Odierno's recent visit.  He hoped for the early drafting of an action plan that would elicit more cooperation from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leadership harboring in northern Iraq:  "We want the KRG to understand that working with us is important."  ISRAEL ------  7. (C) Burns focused on Turkey's strained relationship with Israel.  Sinirlioglu argued "the problem is not bilateral, but general."  He attributed increasing regional country frustration with Israel to the stalled Peace Process, especially on the Palestinian track.  He blamed the lack of progress on Israeli intransigence, which caused regional stake-holders to question Netanyahu's goals.  He contended the "humanitarian situation in Gaza," which is not a punishment of Hamas, but of the Gazan people, fed Turkish popular anger against Israel.  Even so, bilateral cooperation with Israel is continuing.  Turkey is acquiring Israeli military equipment, notably Heron UAVs.  Direct flights between the two countries are routine.  Two-way trade is healthy, he said, tourism has dropped recently, but "will recover."  Sinirlioglu described Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak's mid-January visit as "very good."  He noted the MFA is exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting between the two prime ministers on the margins of an international gathering.  Returning to a GoT obsession, he recalled the Turkey-brokered Syria-Israel proximity talks, "which were shattered by Cast Lead," Israel's December 2008 military operation in Gaza.  Burns noted Syria places high value on Turkey's role as a mediator and repeated Senator Mitchell's statement that Turkey-brokered proximity talks can make an important contribution to the Peace Process.  ANKARA 00000302  003 OF 005    SYRIA -----  8. (C) Sinirlioglu contended Turkey's diplomatic efforts are beginning to pull Syria out of Iran's orbit.  He said a shared hatred for Saddam had been the original impetus for their unlikely alliance.  "Now, their interests are diverging."  Once again pitching Israel-Syria proximity talks, Sinirlioglu contended Israel's acceptance of Turkey as a mediator could break Syria free of Tehran's influence and further isolate Iran.  EU, CYPRUS and GREECE ---------------------  9. (C) Sinirlioglu said Turkey's EU accession is being obstructed by the politically motivated objections of several member states, notably France, Austria and Cyprus.  He reserved special criticism for President Sarkozy.  He accused France of changing the rules mid-game.  He contended French opposition to Turkey's membership is "deepening the cultural divide" between Christian Europe and the Muslim world:  "A wider audience is watching this."  10. (C) He regretted perceived Greek Cypriot complacency regarding the island's reunification talks:  EU "membership makes them invulnerable."  Greek Cypriots, he said, want the world to forget the progress achieved by the Annan Plan in 2004.  They pretend relations between the island's two communities are an internal affair, even though, by treaty, it's been an international issue for 50 years.  Talat's cross-voting proposal, Sinirlioglu continued, should have been a breakthrough, but the Greek Cypriots failed to react. Downer is frustrated, Sinirlioglu alleged, and so are the Turkish Cypriots.  He implied the island's Turkish community would register its frustration by voting out Talat as TRNC "president" in April.  He renewed Turkey's appeal for higher profile direct USG involvement in the negotiations.  11. (C) Sinirlioglu welcomed Greek PM Papandeou's belated response to Erdogan's October 30 letter seeking a frank new discussion of the two neighbors' several long-running disputes.  He conceded Papandreou's delay is understandable in light of his likely preoccupation with Greece's acute financial crisis.  Based on Papandreou's response, Sinirlioglu said, Turkey expects to begin new talks with Greece soon.  AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN and INDIA -------------------------------  12. (C) Burns opened the discussion on Afghanistan with praise for Turkey's military, training and development contributions there.  Sinirlioglu said Turkey had chosen to focus on three Afghan challenges:  "the marriage of Wahhabism and Pashtun nationalism"; the chronic antagonism between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and; the country's security forces deficit.  He said Turkey plans to address the first by ramping up its education programs in Afghanistan; the second by pursuing its trilateral Ankara Process, which sponsors meetings of senior Afghan and Pakistani ministerial and intelligence counterparts, and; the third by establishing a police training center in Kabul that aims for a throughput of 5160 trainees per year.  Keying off the last point, AMB Tacan Ildem, who recently concluded an assignment as Turkey's NATO PERMREP, declared the EUPOL police training effort in Afghanistan a failure.  He said the EU's  criticism of Turkey's unwillingness to work directly with EUPOL is unjustified.  He argued, since Turkey does not have a security agreement with the EU and is excluded from the  ANKARA 00000302  004 OF 005   European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), the GoT lacks a legal basis on which to cooperate with EUPOL.  "We would like the EU to involve us not as a third country, but, in view of our accumulated rights," as a candidate for membership.  He urged the USG not to coordinate bilateral agreements to support EU operations but, instead, to route all cooperation with the EU on security issues through NATO.  13. (C) Deputy Undersecretary for South Asian Affairs Engin Soysal led the discussion on Pakistan.  He described the Ankara Process and the recent Turkey-sponsored Afghanistan Neighbors Summit as Turkish efforts to assert regional responsibility for South Asia's inter-linked problems.  He said Turkey had not invited India to the neighbors summit in deference to Pakistani sensitivities; however, he claimed, Pakistan understands attempting to exclude India from the nascent South Asian regional structures would be a mistake. He reported Indian Prime Minister Singh had requested President Gul's assistance with Pakistan during the latter's visit to New Delhi the previous week.  Acting on that request, Gul had phoned Pakistani President Zardari, who was skeptical of Indian intentions.  Gul is planning to visit Pakistan later this year.  Soysal said Iran is proposing a quadrilateal summit, which would include Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but that proposal had yet to generate enthusiasm.  14. (C) Soysal, Turkey's former ambassador to Pakistan, said the Pakistani military, though displeased with Zardari, remains unwilling to intervene; nevertheless, senior officers' patience may not be infinite.  Zardari needs to increase the democratic legitimacy of parliament.  Soysal offered.  Nawaz Sharif has become a much more constructive player.  15. (C) Soysal urged a NATO training role in Pakistan. Picking up from Soysal, Tacan Ildem suggested NATO invite Pakistani military officers to courses at Oberammergau.  BOSNIA ------  16. (C) Sinirlioglu registered the GoT's determination to resist perceived EU efforts to exclude Turkey from the Balkans, particularly Bosnia.  He identified effecting rapprochement between Bosnia and Serbia as Turkey's immediate diplomatic goal for the region.  Towards that end, Sinirlioglu said, we convinced Haris Siladjdzic, who had been in Ankara the day before, to cease references to Serbian "genocide."    The United States and Turkey have "agreed to disagree" on the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Bosnia; nevertheless, "we value your involvement in the Balkans."  BILATERAL EUROPEAN RELATIONS, NATO ----------------------------------  17. (C) Burns inquired about Turkey's bilateral relations with Europe.  Sinirlioglu briefly recapped Turkey's unhappiness with Sarkozy.  He described his country's relationship with Austria as infected by the latter's ethnic prejudice.  He complained Belgium and Denmark are reluctant to suppress terrorist PKK-affiliated organizations active in their countries.  Tacan Ildem added that, as part of the 2009 POTUS-brokered deal that had overcome Turkish objections to the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General, Denmark had promised to clarify its legal requirements prerequiste to acceding to Turkey's request for the closure of Roj TV, a PKK mouthpiece.  This still needed to be done, Ildem said.  18. (C) Picking up from Ildem, Sinirlioglu recalled the  ANKARA 00000302  005 OF 005   POTUS-brokered deal had included an understanding that a qualified Turk would be considered for Assistant Secretary General.  Instead, he said, a German of uncompelling merit was selected.  "We suspect a deal between Rasmussen and Merkel."  Ildem complained high-level positions should be part of NATO reform:  "We missed an opportunity with the selection of the Assistant Secretary General."  Sinirlioglu added:  "We let Rasmussen have Secretary General, because we trusted you."  MISSILE DEFENSE ---------------  19. (C) Sinirlioglu inquired about Russia's reaction on missile defense.  Burns said the Russians are much more relaxed towards the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and we hope to have more conversations on missile defense bilaterally and, eventually, within the NATO-Russia Council. Sinirlioglu recalled PM Erdogan's request in his recent meeting with SECDEF Gates that the Iranian threat not be highlighted to justify PAA.  20.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ANKARA 000087  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR EUR/SE  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/19/2020 TAGS: PREL TUSUBJECT: WHAT LIES BENEATH ANKARA'S NEW FOREIGN POLICY  REF: A. 09 ANKARA 1717      B. 09 ISTANBUL 466      C. 09 ANKARA 1561 (EXDIS)  Classified By: Ambassador James Jeffrey for reasons 1.4 (b,d)  INTRODUCTION/COMMENT --------------------  1. (C) There is much talk in chanceries and in the international media these days about Turkey's new, highly activist foreign policy, which unquestionably represents a transition not only from prior governments, but also from the AKP regime before the Gaza/Davos events, and before the ascent of Ahmet Davutoglu as Foreign Minister in April.  Some commentaries are upbeat, but others, including many experts and editorial writers in the US, have expressed concern.  The ruling AKP foreign policy is driven by both a desire to be more independently activist, and by a more Islamic orientation.  Frankly, rational national interest, particularly trade opportunities and stability considerations, also drives Turkey's new slant.  Major challenges with us in the coming months include the direction of Turkish-Israeli relations, the fate of the Protocols with Armenia, and the Turkish posture vis--vis Iran.  2. (C) Does  all this mean that the country is becoming more focused on the Islamist world and its Muslim tradition in its foreign policy?  Absolutely.  Does it mean that it is "abandoning" or wants to abandon its traditional Western orientation and willingness to cooperate with us?  Absolutely not. At the end of the day we will have to live with a Turkey whose population is propelling much of what we see.  This calls for a more issue-by-issue approach, and recognition that Turkey will often go its own way.  In any case, sooner or later we will no longer have to deal with the current cast of political leaders, with their special yen for destructive drama and - rhetoric.  But we see no one better on the horizon, and Turkey will remain a complicated blend of world class "Western" institutions, competencies, and orientation, and Middle Eastern culture and religion.  END INTRODUCTION.  COMPONENTS OF POLICY --------------------  "The Traditional Western"  3. (C) Turkish policy today is a mix of "traditional Western" orientation, attitudes and interests, and two new elements, linked with new operational philosophies: "zero conflicts" and "neo-Ottomanism."  The traditional still represents the core of Turkish foreign policy, and is centered on cooperation and integration with the West. Its core is NATO, the customs union with the EU, and most significantly, the EU accession effort.  This all began with the Ottoman effort to emulate the European great powers, and was propelled powerfully forward by Ataturk.  Nevertheless the country was on the sidelines in World War II.  It was only the threat of the USSR, and the dominance (and outstretched hand) of the US, that led to the "Turkey we know":  tough combat partner in Korea, major NATO ally, US anchor in the Middle East. Much of this continues.  4. (C) Europe is by far Turkey's most important economic partner in terms of investment and trade. The EU accounts for 42 percent of Turkey,s total trade, while the US accounts for a bit less than 5 percent.  While the US is much less important in terms of trade statistics, it remains important in various sectors (e.g.energy, aviation, military), and in various ways.  NATO is essential to and much respected by  ANKARA 00000087  002 OF 006   Turkey.  (Note:  The fact that "only" about one-third of the Turkish population in one poll see NATO as important to Turkey's security is actually a plus; on any poll Turks usually are overwhelmingly negative about any foreign engagement or relationship.  But we should not be too sanguine here since support for NATO has been halved over the past decade.  End Note)  The military is armed by the US, and Turkey recognizes that many fires in its back yard -- from Iraq to Afghanistan and Pakistan -- can only be solved by close cooperation with and acceptance of US and NATO leadership.  Finally, even AKP leaders know that much of their allure or "wasta" in the Middle East and elsewhere stems from their privileged position in key Western clubs. This traditional orientation may be shaken, or reduced, but as it has both significant buy-in by elites of all philosophies, and many concrete advantages, Turkey will not abandon it.  "Zero Problems with Turkey's Neighbors"  5. (C) But this Turkey is trying to "post-modernize" itself. One major area of AKP effort has been to resolve problems with Turkey's immediate "near abroad."  This effort stands in contrast with the "traditional" Turkish policy of letting these frozen conflicts fester, and is much more compatible with US and European interests.  The list of Turkish initiatives under the AKP is impressive:  accepting the Annan Plan in 2004 to resolve Cyprus, continuing the 1999 rapprochement with Greece, the opening to Armenia culminating in the signing of recognition protocols, warming and productive relations with both Baghdad and Erbil (the latter complemented by significant reforms in Turkey's relations with its own Kurdish population).  The signature accomplishment of this policy is the wooing of Syria.  While this road to Damascus in fact was paved by Syria's accommodation of prior Turkish governments' demands (relinquishing claims on Turkey's Hatay province, expelling Ocalan), it is touted by the Turks as a game-changer.  As noted below, they have leveraged it to tackle a number of regional problems, from Lebanon to Iran.  6. (C) While this new approach is to be applauded, there is a fly in its ointment.  Little of true practical and final accomplishment has been achieved.  Cyprus is still split (albeit the fault, at least in terms of the Annan plan, lies more with the Greek Cypriots and the EU); tensions with Greece in the Aegean continue; the Protocols with Armenia have not been ratified due to Turkish concerns about Nagorno-Karabakh; Iraq's instability and the KRG's unwillingness to do more against the PKK raise questions about the sustainability of Turkey's constructive Iraq policy; the rapprochement with Syria has not really produced any Syrian "flip" away from Iran.  Granted, Turkey is dealing with some of the world's most difficult actors, and facing stiff opposition at home to making more concessions, but the proof of this pudding is yet to be seen.  "Neo Ottomanism"  7. (C) The idea of Turkey using its cultural and religious links to the Middle East to the advantage of both Turkish interests and regional stability is not new with the AKP, but has been given much more priority by it, in part because of the Islamic orientation of much of the party, including leaders Erdogan, Gul, and Davutoglu.  Moreover, the AKP's constant harping on its unique understanding of the region, and outreach to populations over the heads of conservative, pro-US governments, have led to accusations of "neo-Ottomanism."  Rather than deny, Davutoglu has embraced this accusation.  Himself the grandson of an Ottoman soldier  ANKARA 00000087  003 OF 006   who fought in Gaza, Davutoglu summed up the Davutoglu/AKP philosophy in an extraordinary speech in Sarajevo in late 2009 (REF A).  His thesis: the Balkans, Caucasus, and Middle East were all better off when under Ottoman control or influence; peace and progress prevailed.  Alas the region has been ravaged by division and war ever since.  (He was too clever to explicitly blame all that on the imperialist western powers, but came close). However, now Turkey is back, ready to lead -- or even unite.  (Davutoglu: "We will re-establish this (Ottoman) Balkan").  8. (C) While this speech was given in the Balkans, most of its impact is in the Middle East.  Davutoglu's theory is that most of the regimes there are both undemocratic and illegitimate.  Turkey, building on the alleged admiration among Middle Eastern populations for its economic success and power, and willing to stand up for the interests of the people, reaches over the regimes to the "Arab street." Turkey's excoriating the Israelis over Gaza, culminating in the insulting treatment of President Peres by Erdogan at Davos in 2009, illustrates this trend.  To capitalize on its rapport with the people, and supposed diplomatic expertise and Ottoman experience, Turkey has thrown itself into a half-dozen conflicts as a mediator.  This has worked well, as noted above, with Iraq, and was quite successful in the Syrian-Israeli talks before Gaza.  Turkey has also achieved some limited success on Lebanon and in bringing Saudi Arabia and Syria together.  As noted below, however, this policy brings with it great frictions, not just with us and the Europeans but with many supposed beneficiaries of a return to Ottoman suzerainty.  Furthermore, it has not achieved any single success of note.  WHY THE CHANGE? ---------------  9. (C) Various factors explain the shifts we see in Turkish foreign policy beyond the personal views of the AKP leadership:  -- Islamization:  As reported REF B, religiosity has been increasing in Turkey in past years, just as has been seen in many other Muslim societies.  The AKP is both a beneficiary of, and a stimulus for, this phenomenon.  However, bitter opposition within Turkey against domestic "pro-Islamic" reforms (e.g., head scarves) has frustrated the AKP, and a more "Islamic" or "Middle Eastern" foreign policy offers an alternative sop for the AKP's devout base.  -- Success:  Despite its problems, Turkey over the past 50 years has been a success story, rising to the 16th largest economy and membership in the G-20.  This, along with its extraordinary security situation compared to all other regional states, and democratic system, encourage a more active -- and more independent -- leadership role in regional and even global affairs.  -- Economics:  one secret of Turkish success has been its trade and technology-led economic growth.  This growth is in good part thanks to its customs union with the EU, by far its biggest export market, and resulting investment from the EU, as well as decades of technology transfer and educational assistance from the U.S.  Nevertheless, with exports to the EU down due to the 2008-2009 crisis, Turkey is looking for new markets, particularly in the hydrocarbon rich Arab world, Iran, Russia, and Caucasus/Central Asia.  They have money, and strong import demand, and Turkey is dependent on them for its oil and gas.  These countries, however, (along with China-another Turkish export target) tend much more than the EU and North America to mix politics and trade.  To some  ANKARA 00000087  004 OF 006   degree the West thus is taken for granted and economic priority is directed towards relations with the Middle East and "Eurasia."  -- Civilians ascendant: Erdogan's political success - together with a number of messy scandals resulting in public investigation - has meant that the Turkish General Staff now plays a much smaller role in defining Turkey's foreign policy.  Turkey's support to NATO is still strong, but it now lacks the suspicion of Russia which the cold-war instinct of General Staff brought to the mix.  -- EU disillusionment:  Both popular and elite Turkish opinion has recently grown much more pessimistic about eventual EU membership -- or even its value.  The reasons for this are complex, but include the shifting mood in Europe towards Islam, the replacement of "pro-Turkey" leaders in France and Germany by Sarkozy and Merkel, both decidedly cool towards Turkey's EU membership, and a sense in Turkey of distance from and lack of sympathy for Europe.  -- Relativization of the Western anchor.  An op-ed in the Financial Times by Gideon Rechman on January 4 noted correctly the tendency of the "young giants" -- South Africa, Brazil, India, and Turkey -- to pursue Third Worldish policies and rhetoric even while benefitting enormously from the globalized trade and international security created and maintained by the "West."  That certainly characterizes Turkey.  With the end of the cold war, relative success in the struggle with the PKK, and the "taming" of Syria, Iraq, and (at least from Turkey's point of view) Iran, Turkey's need for NATO and U.S. security is reduced.  Its dependence on Western trade, investment, technology transfer and educational exchange remains critical, but is regarded as a "free good" that Turkey deserves and does not have to expend effort for.  Relations with its various new friends in the North-East-South or on the other hand require effort which is facilitated by some downplaying of Turkey's Western anchor.  DAVUTOGLU DISCONTENTS ---------------------  10. (C) The AKP's new approach to international affairs receives mixed reviews inside and outside Turkey.  It is not a major factor in the AKP's relative popularity, but several elements of it (unfortunately, those we are least happy with) do appeal to voters.  Criticism of Israel post-Gaza is overwhelmingly popular, and the relatively soft Turkish position on Iran -- a country about which many Turks are skeptical -- is presumably helpful with a narrow, but for Erdogan's electoral fate important, group of Islamic voters associated with former PM Erbakan.  11. (C) Nevertheless, many in Turkey's large westernized elite see the Islamic Outreach as a complement to the alleged AKP plan to Islamize Turkish society, and complain bitterly about their country's losing its western moorings.  The Nationalist segment in Turkey, mobilized most by the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), sees the AKP's compromises on Armenia, the KRG in northern Iraq, Cyprus, etc, as a betrayal of diaspora "Turks" (the Iraqi Turkomen, Azeris, Turkish Cypriots, etc) and charges that the AKP is trying to replace the Republic's organizing principle of "Turkism" with the broader Islamic "Umma."  The Republican People's Party (CHP), the lead opposition party, attacks AKP foreign policy relatively ineffectively with a mix of MHP-like nationalist rhetoric and "abandoning the west" criticism.  12. (C) But it is in the EU that the Erdogan foreign policy of late has run into the heaviest of sailing.  To some degree  ANKARA 00000087  005 OF 006   European angst at Turkey's "new direction" is viewed as an excuse to pummel Turkey to score domestic points among anti-foreigner elements.  But there is real concern in Europe, made manifest by the Rasmussen NATO SecGen issue last April.  Europeans were furious with Turkey's presentng itself as the "Islamic" voice or conscience in NATO, having consulted with Middle Eastern States before talking to its NATO allies.  Extrapolating that behavior into the even more diversity-intolerant EU is a nightmare.  Erdogan's foreign (and domestic) policy orientation conjures up not just a clash of Christianity and Islam, but the spectre of a "meld" of Europe and the Middle East, and of Europe's secularlism with oriental religiosity.  Davutoglu and others argue that Turkey's "success" as a coming Middle East power makes it more attractive to the EU -- giving Europe a new foreign policy "market" through Turkey.  While some in Europe appear interested in this idea, ironically including Turkey EU membership skeptic France, this does not seem to carry much weight in most European capitals, let alone populations.  13. (C) Finally, not all of the ex-Ottomans look with fondness on their past under the Pashas, or yearn for Turkey's return.  Reaction among many in the Balkans to Davutoglu's Sarejevo speech (REF A) was quite strong. In the Middle East itself, the Arab street might applaud Turkey's populistic and essentially cost-free support for more radical elements, but it's not particularly appreciated by rulers (although Turkey seems to have made some progress with Syria, brokered a rapprochement between President Bashir and Saudi King Abdullah, and has had some role in resolving the Lebanon cabinet stalemate).  Sooner or later, though, Turkey will have to produce results, take risks, commit real resources, and take hard decisions to augment a policy now consisting mainly of popular slogans, ceaseless trips, and innumerable signatures on MOUs of little importance.  The experience with Iran, which despite significant Turkish verbal support and wooing, appears uninterested in granting Turkey any concessions, or agreeing to a Turkish lead in mediation efforts, is telling.  THE PROBLEM FOR THE US ----------------------  14. (C) Turkey's new foreign policy is a mixed bag for us. Having regional heavyweights take on burdens, thereby relieving us, has long been a desired goal of US policy, but it comes with a certain loss of control.  Nevertheless, on a whole host of key issues of supreme importance to us -- Afghanistan and Pakistan, cooperation in and on Iraq, NATO efforts (although a leading Turkish role in Missile Defense will not be easy) -- Turkey is a crucial ally, and our use of Incirlik, Habur gate, and Turkish airspace for our Iraq and Afghanistan operations is indispensible.  Its "zero conflicts" initiatives, which have moved Turkey forward on more of the key bilateral spats -- Cyprus, Greece, Kurds, Northern Iraq, Armenia -- than we have seen with any other Turkish government, also support U.S. interests.  15. (C) Nevertheless, these latter issues illustrate two problems.  At least in Turkish eyes, on this complex of issues the US , especially the media, interest groups, and Congress, default to a "blame Turkey" posture regardless of whatever it does.  Second, Turkey has repeatedly run into trouble actually consummating these various openings -- the Armenian protocols being the best example, but continued overflights of Greek islands and domestic opposition to the Kurdish opening are also relevant.  What we fear is that this inability to bring to conclusion foreign policy initiatives will affect not just the above, but most Turkish policy, given the over-extension of Davutoglu and his team, and a  ANKARA 00000087  006 OF 006   tendency to substitute rhetoric for long term investment of diplomatic, military, and assistance capital.  (Fortunately, Afghanistan/Pakistan and Iraq are the two major exceptions to this tendency.)  16. (C) The greatest potential strategic problem for the US, however, and the one that has some of the commentators howling, is the Turks neo-Ottoman posturing around the Middle East and Balkans.  This "back to the past" attitude so clear in Davutoglu's Sarajevo speech, combined with the Turks' tendency to execute it through alliances with more Islamic or more worrisome local actors, constantly creates new problems.  Part of this is structural.  Despite their success and relative power, the Turks really can't compete on equal terms with either the US or regional "leaders" (EU in the Balkans, Russia in the Caucasus/Black Sea, Saudis, Egyptians and even Iranians in the ME).  With Rolls Royce ambitions but Rover resources, to cut themselves in on the action the Turks have to "cheat" by finding an underdog (this also plays to Erdogan's own worldview), a Siladjcic, Mish'al, or Ahmadinejad, who will be happy to have the Turks take up his cause.  The Turks then attempt to ram through revisions to at least the reigning "Western" position to the favor of their guy.  Given, again, the questioning of Western policy and motives by much of the Turkish public and the AKP, such an approach provides a relatively low cost and popular tool to demonstrate influence, power, and the "we're back" slogan.  17. (C) This has been, so far, manageable, if at times high maintenance, in the Balkans and Mideast, although the damage to Israeli-Turkish relations remains serious.  If the Turks are genuine in their desire to draw Syria away from Iran, and if they begin achieving real success rather than telephone books worth of questionable protocols, then that will be of benefit to us all.  But with Iran itself it is a different story.  REF C  describes the background to the Turkish relationship with Iran, one more complicated than with their ex-Ottoman Arab and other subjects.  Trade/hydrocarbon interests, Turkish aversion to sanctions stemming from the first Gulf War, Erdogan's vocal "third worldism" and certain domestic political considerations all push Turkey in the wrong direction.   Unlike with many of the other issues, however, Turkey will have to stand and be counted on Iran, in the Security Council, with MD, and in implementation of UN or US sanctions.  This will have a profound effect on relations second only to the fate of the Armenian protocols over the next year.

(C) Summary:  President Aliyev used this coarse street slang to describe the relationship between Russian President Medvedev and PM Putin, but he might well have used the same idiom to describe his concerns about Turkey-Armenia reconciliation and the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) Peace Process. He told U/S Burns that the "Sword of Damocles" of the April 24 Armenian Remembrance Day is hanging over the NK Process, as well as the Turkey-Armenia normalization process.  He suggested that it would be easier if the Turkey-Armenia normalization could be considered after April in order to allow more time for progress on NK.  He also took the opportunity to press the USG to apply maximum pressure on Yerevan to make concessions on NK.  He stressed, "Now we are trying to be even more flexible."  2.  (C) Summary Continued:  On Iran, President Aliyev said he supported economic isolation and believed it could be effective if enforced by a broad coalition.  He complained about Iranian security provocations.  On a proposed battalion-sized Afghanistan contribution, Aliyev said that he would support sending a team to Georgia to observe the training being provided by EUCOM to Georgian troops headed for Afghanistan.  On energy cooperation, President Aliyev said that if the Turks demonstrate "constructive behavior" this year that a gas transit deal can happen.  Finally, on the jailed youth activists, though he made no firm commitments regarding their release, he said, "I think (a pardon or amnesty) can be done.  I had no intention to hurt anyone."  End Summary.  Seeks Pressure on Yerevan to Resolve NK ---------------------------------------  3.  (C) Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns began his hour-long meeting with President Ilham Aliyev by stressing that he was sent with the simple message that Washington wants to build our bilateral relations and create a stronger partnership.  He then offered his condolences for the three Azeri soldiers killed on the Line of Contact on February 18.  Aliyev responded that such events show that there is no peace, no peace treaty and no peacekeepers enforcing the cease-fire.  He worried more such incidents could happen.  Burns commented that such incidents underscored the urgency of finding a political solution on Nagorno-Karabakh.  4.  (C) The balance of Aliyev,s comments sought to convey that he was ready to move forward in the Minsk Group Process, but that international pressure would be needed if Armenia was to move forward.  He said that it is now time to find a final resolution, but Armenian President Sargsian wants to walk away from the process.  "I told the co-chairs that Armenia wants to delay as long as possible and escape at the end.""  He said that Azerbaijan was prepared to do its part to propel the talks forward.  "Now we will try to be even more flexible."  5.  (C) Aliyev outlined several steps to persuade Armenia to agree to the Minsk Group Basic Principles:  -- the three co-chair countries should consolidate their efforts at a senior-level,  -- (C) the three co-chair countries should send a strong message that the independence of NK is not under review, and  -- (C) if these new proposals are not accepted, there should be consequences in terms of international isolation, especially in the form of Russia,s curtailing some of its economic support for Armenia.  6.  (C) Aliyev noted that at Sochi, President Sargsian had inserted a proposal for specifying a definite date for a referendum or plebiscite on NK final status.  This, Aliyev argued, undermined the entire framework of the agreement, which is premised on an eventual referendum ) with no definite timeframe ) in exchange for legalizing "the illegally established regime in NK.""  He also noted that Armenia is vulnerable to isolation because it is dependent upon remittances from its diaspora, as well as imports of gas and electricity.  "After 18 years of negotiation, we have tested all options.  If this phase (of Minsk Group talks) ends, what is next?" the President asked aloud.  The Russian Role in NK and Russian Succession  BAKU 00000134  002 OF 004   ---------------------------------------------  7.  (C) In response to U/S Burns' question about the Russian role in the NK talks, Aliyev responded that he was convinced that Medvedev's efforts have been sincere.  He said that Medvedev has personally met with the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents five times.  Thus any failure to make progress on this issue will damage Medvedev's credibility.  He said that at Sochi, Medvedev tried to persuade Sargsian to achieve a breakthrough.  He added, however, that it was strange that with so much pressure from Moscow and Lavrov's visit to Yeveran, the Armenians not only resisted progress, but actually backtracked on previously-agreed items.  In response to a question, Aliyev said that he believes that PM Putin has his own separate opinion about the desirability of an NK resolution.  "I have no evidence, but I can feel this," Aliyev remarked.  8.  (C) Aliyev said that he considers Medvedev "a modern, new-generation intellectual," surrounded by people whom he does not control.  He said that he has personally witnessed Medvedev taking decisions that then required further approval before they were implemented, referring specifically to a border demarcation agreement that he had agreed with Medvedev only to have it stymied by ""others,"" presumably in the prime ministerial office.  He added, "Many high-ranking officials don't recognize (Medvedev) as a leader."  He said that there are signs of a strong confrontation between the teams of the two men, although not yet between Putin and Medvedev personally.  "We have a saying in Azeri, 'Two heads cannot be boiled in one pot'" (crude street slang suggesting that two leaders are spoiling for a fight).  Strong Pushback on the Turkey-Armenia Normalization --------------------------------------------- -------  9.  (C) U/S Burns stressed that the U.S. believes that progress on the Turkey-Armenia protocols could create political space for Sargsian to be more flexible on NK.  He continued that the reverse was also true, that a failure of the Turkey-Armenia process would almost certainly result in serious negative consequences for the NK process.  Aliyev said that NK progress would require a minimum of five or six months.  He suggested that the entire Turkey-Armenia protocol ratification process be delayed until after April 24.  He said that the "Sword of Damocles" of Armenian Remembrance Day is hanging unhelpfully not only over the Turkey-Armenia process, but also now the NK progress.  "If there were no deadline, maybe we could see how to combine our efforts (to resolve NK)."  10.  (C) Aliyev pushed back with his usual warnings about the negative effects of Turkey-Armenia protocol ratification without being proceeded by NK progress.  He darkly predicted postponement of any NK settlement; no comprehensive regional security improvement; damage to Turkey-Azerbaijani relations; no real partnership between Turkey and Armenia; further isolation of Central Asia; the undermining of energy projects; and damage to Georgia, both in lost transit income, but also in its role as the sole land corridor between Russia and Armenia.  Relations with Iran Described as Tense and Unstable --------------------------------------------- ------  11.  (C) U/S Burns explained in detail the steps the U.S. had taken to initiate dialogue with Tehran and support the Tehran Research Reactor initiative.  He ended by noting that, given the rejection of these overtures, the U.S. would move forward with another UNSC resolution that included new sanctions targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Aliyev responded that although the visible side of Azerbaijan's relations with Iran appears normal, the substance was very different.  "I do not exclude that relations will be become more difficult," the President added.  12.  (C) "(German Chancellor) Merkel was very firm with me on Iran, trying to persuade me.  I told her, 'No need,'" the President recalled.  He said that he was supportive of Iran's economic isolation and believed it could work if the international community worked together.  He said that earlier sanctions observance had been spotty with many European energy companies working in Iran.  "Statoil supports Iran more than it supports us!" he complained.  He noted that Russian President Medvedev once told him that Russia did not want the Americans to squeeze Iran, but also did not want a nuclear Iran.   BAKU 00000134  003 OF 004   13.  (C) Aliyev said that Iranian provocations in Azerbaijan were on the rise.  He specifically cited not only the financing of radical Islamic groups and Hezbollah terrorists, but also:  -- the Iranian financing of violent Ashura ceremonies in Nakhchivan,  -- the organization of demonstrations in front of the Azeri consulates in Tabriz and Istanbul,  -- a violent religious procession recently in Baku,  -- the use of the President's photo alongside the Star of David on the Azeri-language Seher TV broadcast into Azerbaijan, and  -- conflict in the Caspian.  14.  (C) The President added that Azerbaijan will not reciprocate on the liberalization of the visa regime with Iran.  He also noted that Azerbaijan is planning to create a TV channel in Persian that will broadcast into Iran.  He said that he did not understand why the Supreme Religious Leader chose Ahmadinejad over former President Moussavi.  He joked that perhaps it was too dangerous to have two ethnic Azeris at the head of the Iranian state.  He said that the election fraud was outrageous, with Ahmadinejad winning in Azeri-dominated Tabriz and Moussavi winning in Tehran, where it was harder to falsify the vote.  He viewed the situation as very tense within Iran and believed it could erupt at any time.  Supports Afghanistan Troop Contribution, with Conditions --------------------------------------------- -----------  15.  (C) U/S Burns asked for the President's support to continue our discussions about a battalion-sized contribution of troops to Afghanistan that would include a U.S. train and equip program.  The President said that he is aware of this initiative and his foreign and defense ministries are working on it.  He said that the fundamental problem is one of ""optics,""  claiming it was difficult for him politically if it looks like the Americans are only training Azeri troops to send them off to Afghanistan.  He said that it would be easier if half of those trained would be sent to Afghanistan, while the second half would remain in Azerbaijan or be used for other purposes.  U/S Burns noted that the President's suggestion would create problems involving the U.S. funding of the training.  The Charge proposed that as an initial step, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry staff observe the training of Georgian troops headed to Afghanistan by U.S. Marines.  The President thought this was a good idea and instructed his aide to look at this suggestion.  Pardon or Amnesty of the Youth Activists "Can be Done" --------------------------------------------- ---------  16.  (C) U/S Burns said that one of the ways Azerbaijan could show leadership as a tolerant and secular country was in advancing democracy and human rights.  He specifically asked that, following the appeal process of the two youth activists, the President find a way on humanitarian grounds to release the two men.  Aliyev made no firm commitment, but responded, "I think this can be done.  I had no intention to hurt anyone."  When U/S Burns expressed the hope that the government could quietly take this step, the President said, "Okay."  Russians are a Factor in Turkish Gas Transit --------------------------------------------  17.  (C) On energy cooperation, President Aliyev said that if the Turks demonstrate "constructive behavior" this year that a gas transit deal can happen.  He was clear, however, that nothing would be signed before April 24.  He also professed to be worried that active Turkish-Russian cooperation could be one of the impediments to progress.  He confided that Turkish Energy Minister Yildiz recently told the head the Azerbaijani State Oil Company, "Why do you want to ruin our relations with Russia?  Do you really need Nabucco?"  18.  (C) The President continued that it is imperative for Azerbaijan that formalities for the commencement of Shah Deniz Phase II gas development begin this year.  This project will bring $20 billion in much-needed investment to Azerbaijan and potentially develop Azerbaijan into a major source of new gas, as much as 50 billion cubic meters.  BAKU 00000134  004 OF 004    19.  (C) Unprompted by U/S Burns, Aliyev spelled out the reasons Azerbaijan decided to sell gas to Russia last year, noting that ""Moscow had asked" and offered a good price for gas that was surplus anyway.  But the real reason, Aliyev confided, was that the sale illustrated to "our Turkish friends" that they will not be allowed to create a gas distribution hub.  "Aliyev made clear his distaste for the Erdogan government in Turkey, underscoring the "naivete" of their foreign policy and the failure of their initiatives, including the loss of support for Turkey among traditional international friends because of Ankara,s hostility to Israel.  He noted that in his view, there had never been any merit to the notion of a "moderate Islamist" government in Turkey, and that Erdogan,s insistence on promoting Hamas and Gaza ) when other Arab countries were notably silent on these issues ) had brought Turkey no benefits.  20.  (U) Lastly, U/S Burns asked for the President's assistance in resolving the long-standing difficulties in finalizing the lease for the new Embassy compound.  The President responded positively that he thought this could be done.  21.  (U) U/S Burns was accompanied by EUR Deputy Assistant Secretary Amb. Tina Kaidanow, NSC Director Bridget Brink, and Charge.  President Aliyev was joined by his Foreign Policy Advisor Novruz Mammadov.  22.  (U) This message has been cleared by U/S Burns. LU

(U) This is an action request.2. (C) Embassy Berlin strongly recommends that the WashingtonTerrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) and data privacyexperts currently scheduled to visit Brussels next week alsovisit Berlin to discuss TFTP and U.S. data privacy policywith German officials. Germany is critical to the debate ondata protection issues within the EU and we need to engageGerman government interlocutors, parliamentarians and opinionmakers. The exaggerated data privacy views of the currentminority governing partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP),have contributed to a domestic discussion that distorts U.S.policy and is negatively-influencing the European debate.Embassy believes we will be most successful if we addressGerman data privacy concerns in a comprehensive way,including various information sharing programs such asHSPD-6, TFTP, and Passenger Name Records.3. (C) Germany has become a difficult partner with regards tosecurity-related information sharing initiatives followingthe September 27 national elections, which brought the FDPinto the governing coalition. The FDP sees themselves asdefenders of citizens' privacy rights and these views haveled the FDP to oppose many of Germany's post-9/11counterterrorism legislative proposals (see reftels). Attimes, the FDP's fixation on data privacy and protectionissues looks to have come at the expense of the party formingresponsible views on counterterrorism policy.4. (C) Over the past months, Ambassador Murphy, the DCM, andother embassy staff have engaged German governmentinterlocutors, influential parliamentarians and lawenforcement officials to stress the importance ofsecurity-related information sharing initiatives such asTFTP. However, in these meetings, our German counterpartsconsistently raise concerns about U.S. data protectionmeasures and policy. Furthermore, the German views oftendistort and misrepresent U.S. policy. For example, currentFederal Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger(FDP) - who has considerable influence - is particularlyoutspoken and does not appear to have (or perhaps want) aninformed view of USG data privacy practices. It is criticalthat we aggressively and vocally counter thesemisrepresentations of U.S. policy.5. (C) Embassy staff raised the prospect of an inter-agencyexperts group visiting Berlin with xxxxx.xxxxx who is a strong supporter of close U.S.-Germancounterterrorism cooperation and information sharing,welcomed the proposal and believed that skeptics of U.S.policy in other ministries and Bundestag parliamentarianswould benefit from a comprehensive and factual discussion ofthe details of U.S. data protection policy.6. (C) In addition to our request that the Treasury visitorsto Brussels add a Berlin-stop, we strongly recommend that aninter-agency data privacy experts delegation visit Berlin todiscuss overall U.S. data privacy policy with Germanofficials. The FDP returned to power after a ten-year forayin the opposition and key leaders lack experience in thepractical matters of tackling real-world security issues inthe Internet age. In our meetings we have made the pointthat countering terrorism in a globalized world, whereterrorists and their supporters use open borders andinformation technology to quickly move people and financing,requires robust international data sharing. We need to alsoBERLIN 00000128 002 of 002demonstrate that the U.S. has strong data privacy measures inplace so that robust data sharing comes with robust dataprotections.Murphy
C O N F I D E N T I A L BERLIN 000153SIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 02/03/2020TAGS: PGOV PREL EFIN ECON GMSUBJECT: DEFLATED EXPECTATIONS FOR MERKEL'S DREAM COALITIONAFTER FIRST 100 DAYSREF: 2009 BERLIN 1528 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Greg Delawie for reasons 1.4 (b, d).1. (C) Summary: One hundred days after Germany's black-yellow coalition took office, a strong, unified government led by Chancellor Merkel has yet to materialize. The much anticipated dream coalition comprised of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister the Christian Social Union (CSU), and Free Democratic Party (FDP) which promised a unified conservative approach to the economy and like minded thinking on social welfare, the environment, and foreign policy has become bogged down in party politics with no end in sight. Recent polls show that the bickering may be at least partly to blame for the FDP's 5.6 percent fall in the polls, with it now down to 9 percent from its historic 14.6 percent election results (see septel) and the CSU plummet to an historic low of 41 percent. Indeed one minister is now threatening resignation. Sources from the three coalition parties have admitted to problems, blaming the other coalition parties, and downplaying their significance. Merkel has come under criticism within her own party for not taking strong public stands and reining in her coalition partners, instead staying above the political fray. The opposition, particularly the Social Democratic Party (SPD), is trying to capitalize on this divided we rule coalition with an eye toward unseating a teetering CDU-FDP coalition in North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) in May elections, thereby tipping the CDU-FDP Bundesrat majority in its favor. Merkel is counting on better economic and political indicators after the NRW election followed by the release of the annual tax forecasts to congeal the coalition. If the CDU/FDP coalition fails in NRW, coalition divisions are likely to become more pronounced. End Summary.Off to a Rocky Start---------------------2. (C) Concluding a coalition agreement in only three weeks, prior to her November 2 departure for Washington to address Congress and in time for the 9 November 20 year anniversary of German unity may have been Chancellor Merkel's first and only major success to date in marshaling coalition unity. But the feat may have had consequences. The haste to sign has left half-resolved differences on tax cuts, economic policy, Afghanistan, Turkey, health care, data protection (see reftel) and other issues that continue to gurgle to the surface. Important to recognize is that each party is operating under its own political pressures from different voting constituencies. The FDP's main goal is to deliver on campaign promises  particularly tax relief  and shore up its base, the CSU is desperate to regain its dominance in Bavaria, and the CDU is seeking to rebuild its eroded voter base. All three parties and the opposition are now gearing up for May 9 elections in NRW. This election in Germany's most populous state, referred to as a small national election, is regarded as a partial vote of confidence on the national coalition, and will determine the Bundesrat majority. If the NRW CDU-FDP coalition fails to return to government, the national CDU-FDP coalition will fall by six seats in the Bundesrat  from 37 to 31 seats  it will lose its majority. Such a loss could well hamper the government's ability to pass major financial or economic legislation.3. (C) Each of the three coalition parties have pointed to the others for instigating tension. CDU party contact xxxxx accused the FDP of functioning as if it were still in the opposition. Senior SPD parliamentarian Hans-Ulrich Klose attributed the coalition strains to the FDP adjusting to being in government after 11 years in the opposition. FDP contact xxxxx accused the CDU/CSU of reacting to their own internal problems: for the CDU, its controversy over the Kunduz airstrike, and for the CSU, its involvement in a major bank scandal. The FDP also points to the CSU's strong rivalry with the FDP, with which it now governs in Bavaria. The CSU is still trying to recover from its historic low voting results in the September 2008 state elections, which forced it for the first time in 46 years to govern within a coalition. All parties, however, have downplayed the significance of the feuds, with senior CDU party operative xxxxx explaining in January that the party leaderships are just now settling in after an exhausting election campaign and intense coalition negotiations. He hoped (more than predicted) that the parties would soon settle into a more cooperative relationship. In January, Merkel called a small summit for coalition leadership with Westerwelle and Seehofer to smooth things over and commit to a new beginning. While the coalition's political edginess receded for a time, policy divisions continue to surface.CDU/CSU vs FDP  the Economy-----------------------------4. (C) While CDU/CSU and FDP voters may be the most likely to cross over to the other party, their mainstay voter bases are different, with the CDU/CSU appealing to economically conservative voters who also support the social market economy, but are socially conservative. The FDP base is composed of free-market advocates, who are socially liberal and strong advocates of civil liberties. The FDP's campaign and continuing mantra has been for much larger tax cuts in 2011, worth 20-24 billion euros, apparently at the expense of both coalition unity and the better judgment of economic experts. The cuts would make getting the deficit back under the EU ceiling of 3 percent of GDP by 2013 nearly impossible. National debt will rise from 66 percent of GDP to 80 percent. There are growing public concerns over rising debt, but also about perceived disarray in the coalition's tax and budget policies. Merkel insists that a decision regarding the tax reduction plans will not be taken before May, when the overall tax revenue forecast is due. Waiting until May also means the coalition will not have to go public with unpopular consolidation measures until after the NRW elections. Finance Minister Schaeuble (CDU) appears unenthusiastic at best about further tax cuts. He has already said deficit reduction measures would have to start in 2011. The CSU has also called the FDP's call for speedy tax relief measures unrealistic despite the fact that it had included such a demand during its election campaign. The most recent squabble between the FDP and CSU is over FDP Health Minister Roesler's plans for health care reform which foresees more care options and the introduction of competition. Seehofer has rejected the proposal, holding fast against radical changes to the system. Roesler has indicated he might resign over this issue.Foreign Policy--------------5. (C) Coalition feuding over economic and tax policy has trumped coalition divisions over foreign policy, although FM Westerwelle has managed a few disruptions in the latter. As a harbinger of hard times to come, as one of his first actions, Westerwelle opposed the naming of CDU Bundestag member Erika Steinbach to the foundation Flight Expulsion and Reconciliation citing possible damage to relations with Poland. As President of Germany's Federation of Expellees, Steinbach is disliked in Poland. While the numbers are disputed, the expellee community, which mainly votes CSU or CDU, has exerted influence on the issue. National and State CDU and CSU politicians came out in support of Steinbach with only Merkel keeping mum. The controversy continues, despite ongoing attempts to reach a compromise, threatening to drain coalition attention and good-will.6. (C) Coalition strains have also surfaced on the issue of overseas deployments. Regarding a troop increase in Afghanistan, Westerwelle's position was at first muddled, as he tried to reflect his party's general negativity toward overseas military deployments while at the same time tending to his role as Germany's chief diplomat in the run-up to the London Conference. In the end, he (together with the opposition) likely played a role in achieving a lower-than-expected troop increase. Westerwelle also convinced the CDU to agree on gradually reducing German participation in UNIFIL. The CSU also rocked the coalition boat on Afghanistan, with Seehofer expressing general skepticism on a troop increase, although he later came around. In addition, CSU Secretary General Dobrindt has ridiculed the federal government's reconciliation concept in Afghanistan as a cash for clunkers version for the Taliban.Comment---------7. (C) Chancellor Merkel may have ironically cast off the yoke of the Grand Coalition only now to be encumbered with a new FDP-CSU double yoke, restrained by an FDP bent on delivering on campaign promises and a CSU distracted over its rivalry with the FDP and internal problems. High expectations for the dream coalition are certainly in part to blame for the current polls, with popularity numbers for Merkel and Westerwelle both having suffered. Worried most, however, are the CDU and FDP politicians in NRW, who fear that the national coalition's squabbling could negatively impact their own chances in the May 9 elections. The leadership threesome  Merkel, Westerwelle, and Seehofer  may make an extra effort to get along, or at least appear to get along, as the NRW elections near. It is not clear that Westerwelle and the FDP, however, believe that it is the squabbling that is unhelpful, or rather its own inability todeliver as yet on certain campaign promises. If it is the latter, more coalition tensions could ensue as Westerwelle begins to expend more energy as FDP Chairman and less as Foreign Minister, gearing up his party for its NRW campaign. Berlin is once again becoming bogged down in political squabbles as the NRW elections near.8. (U) Consulate Munich contributed to this cable.Murphy
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BERLIN 000157  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/03/2020 TAGS: PREL MARR MOPS NATO GM AFSUBJECT: DEFENSE MINISTER ZU GUTTENBERG REVEALS STRUGGLE WITH FM WESTERWELLE ON TROOP INCREASE FOR AFGHANISTAN  REF: A. BERLIN 138      B. BERLIN 112  Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP D. MURPHY. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Defense Minister zu Guttenberg revealed in a February 3 meeting with Ambassador Murphy that coalition partner FM Westerwelle -- not the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) -- had been the single biggest obstacle to the government seeking a bigger increase in German troops for Afghanistan.  But even with the modest planned troop increase of 500 (with 350 more in reserve), zu Guttenberg said a restructuring of the current Bundeswehr presence would allow Germany to increase the number of soldiers involved in the training of Afghan National Army (ANA) by more than 1,000.  While Westerwelle has portrayed his skepticism about additional troops as principled, it was also motivated by a desire to put zu Guttenberg "in his place."  While the size of the troop increase is settled, the length of the new ISAF mandate remains open.  The government is hoping to have the new mandate approved by the Bundestag before the end of February, with significant (if not majority) support from the opposition SPD and Greens.  END SUMMARY.  WESTERWELLE: BIGGEST OBSTACLE  2. (C) In explaining the lower-than-expected planned increase in the number of German troops for Afghanistan, zu Guttenberg told the Ambassador that Westerwelle's opening position in the coalition negotiations on the new mandate had been "not one additional soldier."  In that context, it had been difficult to get agreement on any increase at all.  (Comment: Zu Guttenberg proposed 1,500 additional troops at the initial January 4 mini-cabinet meeting on this issue.  End Comment.)  DOING A LOT MORE WITH A LITTLE MORE  3. (C) To help justify the need for more troops, zu Guttenberg said he had forced the Bundeswehr to do a complete review of all the existing positions in Afghanistan, which had confirmed that some could be eliminated in light of the new ISAF counterinsurgency strategy.  He said a restructuring of the current Bundeswehr presence, combined with the troop increase, would boost the number of soldiers involved in the training of the Afghan National Army (ANA) from 280 to 1,400.  The restructuring includes turning the battalion-size quick reaction force based in Mazar into a "protection and training" battalion.  A second such battalion will be created in Kunduz by augmenting the existing infantry company there with new troops.  Zu Guttenberg reiterated that Germany strongly supports COMISAF's focus on protection of the population and partnering with the Afghan national security forces (ANSF), and that the German "trainers" (i.e., the two new maneuver battalions) will operate in the field with the ANSF.  PUTTING ZU GUTTENBERG IN HIS PLACE  4. (C) While zu Guttenberg said he is avoiding public comment on whether the outcome of the coalition talks on the new mandate is a "victory" for him or Westerwelle, FDP Defense Policy Spokesman Elke Hoff told poloff separately that Westerwelle's hard line against additional troops had been motivated in part to "teach zu Guttenberg a lesson." She claimed that zu Guttenberg had been too presumptuous last fall in making speeches in Canada and the U.S. about how Germany would significantly increase its troop contribution to ISAF.  He might have been able to get agreement on a higher ceiling had he engaged parliamentarians first and showed "greater respect for the political process."  OPEN QUESTION: LENGTH OF THE MANDATE  5. (C) Zu Guttenberg confirmed that the cabinet would formally agree on the proposed new ISAF mandate February 9 and that the first reading in the Bundestag would be February 10.  FM Westerwelle is scheduled to speak on behalf of the government in introducing the proposed mandate.  The government is aiming to hold the final Bundestag vote on the mandate -- following two weeks of committee hearings -- on February 26.  Zu Guttenberg was  BERLIN 00000157  002 OF 002   confident that a large number (if not a majority) of opposition politicians from the SPD and Greens would vote in favor of the new mandate.  6. (C) A February 2 meeting of state secretaries tentatively agreed that the new mandate should run, as is the custom, for one year, expiring in February 2011.  Zu Guttenberg indicated, however, that it might be preferable to stick to the length of the current mandate, which expires in December 2010.  He expressed concern that having the mandate lap over into early 2011 could lead to a premature debate on withdrawal, before the new strategy really had a chance to work.  (Comment: Another option under consideration -- and favored by some in the Chancellery -- is a 18-month mandate, so that any debate on the future of the troop presence would be put off until the fall of 2011.  But the MFA objects that this would only raise the ire of the opposition and give them an excuse to oppose the mandate.  End Comment.)  REASSURING THE GERMANS ON COMMAND OF THE NORTH  7. (C) Zu Guttenberg confirmed that Germany very much welcomed the planned inflow of U.S. forces into the north, especially the helicopter assets, which filled a long-standing shortfall.  He noted, however, that many in Germany question whether the U.S. will be willing to accept continued German leadership of RC-North in view of the increased U.S. presence.  Ambassador Murphy assured him that the U.S. had no issues working for the German command in the North. Murphy

(C) German FM Westerwelle told Amb February 5 that it was important to refocus Afghanistan efforts on civilian reconstruction; that we needed to avoid suggesting German troops engaged in less risk than other countries; that he did not invite Iranian FM Mottaki to Germany or seek a meeting with him; that any discussion of non-strategic nuclear weapons needed to be conducted at 28 at NATO; and that he could not influence any decision by the European Parliament on the SWIFT agreement.  END SUMMARY. 2.  (C) The Ambassador asked about Westerwelle's first 100 days in office.  Though in an ebullient mood, Westerwelle said things were very difficult (FDP slipped another percentage point in the polls hours before the meeting).  He said he had been in France February 4 for a joint cabinet meeting, but that nothing substantive came of it.  He observed that one never really knew what was going to happen with Sarkozy involved.  -------------- AFGHANISTAN -------------  3.  (C) The Ambassador reviewed his own recent trip to Afghanistan.  He shared his impression that the Germans were doing a superb job at all levels from the RC-North commander on down.  He learned how critical mentoring and partnering with Afghan security forces had become.  He noted that the U.S. was sending substantial forces to RC-North, where they would conduct training and be under German command. Westerwelle responded that this was important for Germany and for international cooperation.  The Ambassador added that the U.S. was sending substantial helicopter support as well.  He said that Germans could be proud of their troops in Afghanistan.  Westerwelle responded that this was good news. He said that the London Conference bore an excellent conclusion, and was particularly useful for its focus on civilian progress.  He emphasized the importance of underscoring civilian reconstruction. 4.  (C) With a request for confidentiality, Westerwelle referred to the January 20 "Bild Zeitung" interview with General McChrystal, in which the general is quoted as urging the Germans to take more risks.  Westerwelle recounted that he himself had had to answer questions about this article for ten days, explaining that the Germans were not "peace soldiers" while  other countries provided the combat troops. He said it was important that German troops not be "relativized" and cast as second-class troops.  He observed that Germany had originally deployed 3,500 troops, increased that mandate to 4,500, and was now planning an increase of another 500 plus a reserve.  He emphasized that this was a major contribution compared with other European countries. 5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that he had gained the impression in Afghanistan that police training was more challenging than he had originally understood.  Troops were usually required to provide force protection.  But German police training was the best. 6.  (C) The Ambassador asked how the prospective February 26 Bundestag debate to extend the Bundeswehr mandate in Afghanistan would play out.  Westerwelle said the question was how large a majority would approve the new mandate.  He said that SPD caucus chief Steinmeier displayed good will on this issue.  However, SPD chairman Gabriel wanted to politicize the issue for domestic political gain. Nevertheless, he thought some in the SPD would support the new mandate.  However, Westerwelle expected no support from the Greens.  Westerwelle noted that the May NRW state elections were also affecting the issue in a negative way. That said, he said he could not see Steinmeier opposing the larger mandate.  He hoped the Ambassador would speak with Steinmeier.  ------ IRAN ------  7.  (C) Asked about the February 5 visit of Iranian FM Mottaki to the Munich Security Conference, Westerwelle emphasized that he (Westerwelle) had not invited Mottaki to come to Germany, and Westerwelle had also not requested a meeting with Mottaki.  Rather, it was Mottaki who was asking to see Westerwelle.  Westerwelle said he had still not decided whether he would talk to Mottaki or not.  He reflected concern that Tehran might try to exploit Mottaki's visit to Germany as a distraction, and continue executing people during the visit.  In any case, Westerwelle said his position was exactly the same as the U.S. on Iran, and he would share the results of any meeting with Mottaki, if it took place.  BERLIN 00000164  002 OF 002   8.  (C) Westerwelle said he would meet Russian FM Lavrov and (separately) Chinese FM Yang February 5.  He suggested that Moscow had been changing course on Iran sanctions since the Qom revelations.  The Russians now saw Iran as playing games on the nuclear issue.  However, he observed that China was "hesitant," or even in opposition to sanctions.  Reflecting on his recent visit to China, Westerwelle said he had not perceived any "good will" there at present.  He said he would ask Yang again about Iran and then share the results with the U.S.  Westerwelle opined that it was important also to focus on Brazil as an opinion leader in the Third World.  He noted that President Lula had received Ahmadinejad warmly several months ago.  He added that he was uncertain what the Saudis thought, but that the other Persian Gulf countries seemed to be in an existential panic about the Iranian nuclear program.  ----------- TAC NUKES -----------  9.  (C) Touching briefly on arms control, Westerwelle stated unequivocally that tactical nuclear weapons was an issue for NATO.  He said that when he had received Kissinger, Schulz, Perry and Nunn on February 3 to talk about their global zero proposal, tactical nuclear weapons was not discussed.  He said that the four statesmen were very supportive of President Obama.  ---------- TFTP ---------  10.  (C) The Ambassador raised the challenge of getting the European Parliament to approve an agreement to share data with the U.S. on tracking terrorist finance.  The Ambassador noted the extensive efforts of the Treasury Department and other U.S. agencies to explain the importance of the program to our common security.  He asked how one could get better support for the program.  Westerwelle replied that the German government had been able to come up with a solution for itself a few months ago when the issue first surfaced. (Comment: In fact, German Interior Minister de Maziere's vote to abstain in the EU Council vote on TFTP on November 30 reflected the complete deadlock within the Coalition Government between TFTP advocates in the CDU-controlled Interior Ministry and TFTP opponents in the FDP-controlled Justice Ministery. End Comment.) However, Westerwelle said that now that the issue was in the European Parliament, he had no ability to influence it.  He said that he was very, very aware of the Secretary's interest in this issue. Nevertheless, he had a sense that almost all groups in the European Parliament had concerns with the proposed agreement.  He emphasized that this was not an issue that only concerned his party, the FDP, but rather many others as well. 11. (C) Westerwelle shared that he had not yet appointed a new Coordinator for German-American cooperation.  ---------- COMMENT ---------  12.  (C) Westerwelle (who spoke with ease in English) was in a buoyant mood and more confident on his issues than we have seen him so far.  He seemed ready to defend any intimation that he was less than supportive of a troop surge (Defense Minister zu Guttenberg told the Ambassador two days ago that Westerwelle had worked for no increase of German troops for Afghanistan, see Berlin 157) with invocations of the importance of civilian reconstruction.  On Iran, he leapt at the chance to tell us he had not invited Mottaki.  His dodges on both tactical nuclear weapons and terrorist finance were all but practiced.  His comment that he was unable to affect the vote in the EU Parliament on TFTP was a bit disingenuous; on February 4, an MFA official acknowledged to visiting Treasury officials in Berlin that German MEPs were in fact leading the charge against TFTP in the EU Parliament with the tacit support of the FDP, if not of specialists in the Justice Ministry and MFA themselves. Westerwelle still cuts a good image in meetings and in the press here, even though his party continues a bout of free fall in the polls.  His ministry, though, still wonders (privately to us) where he gets his policy direction from.  END COMMENT. 13.  (U) The Ambassador did not have the chance to clear this cable before departing Berlin.    Murphy
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BERLIN 000180  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  DEPT FOR EUR, L, S/CT, EEB, INL TREASURY FOR TFI  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/11/2020 TAGS: PTER KTFN PGOV PREL PINR ETTC EAIR EFIN KCRMKJUS, KHLS, GM SUBJECT: CHANCELLOR MERKEL ANGERED BY LACK OF GERMAN MEP SUPPORT FOR TFTP  REF: A. BERLIN 176      B. BERLIN 128  Classified By: ROBERT A. POLLARD, Minister-Counselor for Economics Affa irs, for Reasons 1.4 (b and d).  1. (C) SUMMARY: Chancellor Merkel is privately angry over the lack of support German members of the European Parliament gave the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) interim agreement and is worried that Washington will view the EP's veto as a sign that Europe does not take the terrorist threat seriously.  Merkel is particularly irritated with German MEPs from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and sister Christian Social Union (CSU) parties, most of whom reportedly voted against the agreement despite previously indicating they would support it.  Public German reactions to the EP vote have come exclusively from TFTP detractors who portrayed the veto as a sign that the European Parliament has won a victory over an arrogant Commission/Council, as well as delivering a rebuke to U.S. counterterrorism policies that undervalue data privacy.  These events suggest the need to intensify our engagement with German government interlocutors, Bundestag and European parliamentarians, and opinion makers to demonstrate that the U.S. has strong data privacy measures in place.  END SUMMARY   2. (C) Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust (CDU) told Ambassador today (2/12) that he had met with Chancellor Merkel last night and she was "very, very angry - angrier than he had ever seen her" with the outcome of the vote.  Beust said that the Chancellor had personally lobbied German MEPs from the CDU/CSU parties to support the agreement, but that most of these MEPs ended up voting against the agreement anyway. Merkel expressed concerns to Beust that Washington will view the EP veto as a sign that Europe does not take the terrorist threat seriously.  Merkel also worried about the ramifications (presumably within Europe and for transatlantic relations) that might follow were a terrorist attack to occur that could have been prevented had SWIFT data been exchanged.    3. (C) Federal Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a strong proponent of data privacy rights from the Free Democratic Party (FDP; see reftels), quickly welcomed the TFTP veto.  She said "the citizens of Europe have won a victory today that strengthened not just data protection, but democracy in all of Europe."  The Minister has been a vocal critic of the TFTP and in interviews today stressed that the EP veto will lead to a change of European policy in which "data protection is no longer just an appendix of security policy."  She also restated her understanding that German investigators believe TFTP data has not/not contributed meaningfully to terrorism investigations.  She said the EP decision paves the way for new negotiations that take into account European notions of data protection.   4. (C) Some German members of the European Parliament likewise applauded the TFTP veto.  Green Party MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht stated that the vote would not cause a "transatlantic ice-age" because President Obama has more important concerns and would not "emphasize this defeat too much at home."  Werner Langen, head of the EP CDU/CSU group, said that his group did not vote against the United States, but rather against the European Commission and the Council who had "negotiated a bad agreement."  Martin Schulz, head of the Social Democratic faction, said that the "negotiating position of the EU is now better."  FDP MEP Alexander Graf Lambsdorff acknowledged that the decision could be a temporary irritation in transatlantic relations, but believed that this would not last long and the time would soon come to "negotiate a reasonable agreement."  Bavarian State Minister Mueller told Munich CG that the CSU is interested in moving forward with the negotiation of a new agreement that meets US and European needs.   5. (C) COMMENT:  Why did so many German MEPs oppose TFTP?  BERLIN 00000180  002 OF 002   First, the debate was not just about TFTP.  Germans across the political spectrum adamantly support data protection ) whether it has to do with Passenger Name Records, Google,s supposed  on data searches, or individual credit ratings.  Recent scandals in which major firms such as Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bahn illegally tapped phones or files of tens of thousands of employees and customers reinforced Germans, concerns about the misuse of data technology.  Historical memory also plays a part, as stories about how the Stasi abused information to destroy people,s lives still regularly circulate in the press.  Paranoia runs deep especially about U.S. intelligence agencies.  We were astonished to learn how quickly rumors about alleged U.S. economic espionage ) at first associated with the new U.S. air passenger registration system (ESTA), then with TFTP ) gained currency among German parliamentarians in the run-up to the February 11 vote in Strasbourg.  Moreover, the fact that the libertarian Free Democratic Party (FDP) made data privacy a central plank of the pact with its coalition partners, the CDU/CSU ) and more importantly, captured the Justice Ministry ) made it very difficult for TFTP advocates like Interior Minister de Maiziere to speak up.  None of this may excuse the behavior of certain German MEPs, but it says something about the challenge ahead.   6. (C) COMMENT CONT.: The overwhelming rejection of the interim agreement by German MEPs from all political parties nonetheless is surprising.  Although we anticipated that the FDP and Greens would come out strongly against the interim agreement, the broad lack of support it received from the CDU/CSU and Social Democrats was unexpected.  We believe a number of factors contributed to this including the fact that MEPs of all stripes saw this as an early opportunity to exert their new post-Lisbon powers and send a message to the Commission and Council.  Specific to Germany, the almost complete absence of public statements by German leadership in support of the agreement resulted in a situation in which MEPs received no political coverage supporting a positive vote and saw little political cost for a no vote. Furthermore, the German public and political class largely tends to view terrorism abstractly given that it has been decades since any successful terrorist attack has occurred on German soil.  This week's TFTP vote demonstrates that we need to intensify our engagement with German government interlocutors, Bundestag and European parliamentarians and opinion makers to get our views across.  We need to also demonstrate that the U.S. has strong data privacy measures in place so that robust data sharing comes with robust data protections. Murphy
UNCLAS CAIRO 000219  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ECON EFIN PGOV SOCI EGSUBJECT: Egypt: Tax Reform Continues As Revenues Meet Lowered Expectations  REF: 10 CAIRO 26  1. (SBU) KEY POINTS    -- Egypt's Tax Commissioner expects the implementation of the new real estate law to proceed without significant alternations.    -- He claims that much of the public resistance to filing property declarations is rooted in people's desire to maintain the secrecy of their wealth, which has traditionally been held in real estate.    -- Egypt's tax revenue is down substantially from last year, but appears to be on track to meet budgetary expectations.    -- No new tax laws are expected to be presented to the Parliament prior to the upcoming parliamentary and presidential election cycles, but the Tax Authority will continue working to automate its systems and improve data collection in support of expanding and deepening the tax base.    --------------------------------------------- -------------------  Real Estate Tax Law Unchanged  --------------------------------------------- -------------------    2. (SBU) In a February 7 meeting, Ashraf Al Arabi, Egypt's Deputy Minister of Finance for Tax Policy and Commissioner of the Egyptian Tax Authority, told us that he was confident that implementation of the real estate tax would go ahead as scheduled (ref A). He acknowledged the negative publicity surrounding the registration of properties, which had "created anxiety" among taxpayers. Despite this, he was confident that the plan would move forward  with "no official changes." Referencing President Mubarak's comments last month,  in which Mubarak suggested he might advocate for a progressive tax structure or possible homestead exemption, Al Arabi told us that the real estate tax situation had subsequently "been clarified to the President" and that Mubarak supported leaving the law intact.    3. (SBU) Al Arabi explained that there were a number of reasons for the public outcry against the real estate tax: Since most income tax is paid through direct payroll deductions, the vast majority of taxpayers in Egypt have no experience dealing directly with the Tax Authority (Note: for taxpayers who have income tax deducted by their employer, there is no annual tax filing requirement. End note). His office, Al Arabi said, deals directly with only about 3.1 million corporate and self-employed tax filers. The new real estate tax registration requirement will now bring 40 million Egyptians in contact with the Tax Authority. He added that part of the outcry relates to people's resistance to disclosing their real estate holdings.  According to Al Arabi, Egyptians have traditionally used real estate as their primary store of wealth, and people do not want information on their assets disclosed to the government or made public. This echoes his public comments suggesting that once holdings are declared, some people, particularly government employees, might find it difficult to explain where they got the resources to buy the properties they own.    --------------------------------------------- -------------------  Revenues on Track, But  Reforms Have Slowed  --------------------------------------------- -------------------    4. (SBU) In Egypt's fiscal 2009/10 budget, tax revenues are projected at LE 145.5 billion (US$26.5 billion) down 10.8% from last year. Actual tax revenues during the first six month of the   fiscal year (July-December) are down 8.5%. Tax revenues from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), the state-owned oil company, which were budgeted to drop 45% due to lower world oil prices are actually running about 6% lower than the already reduced budget forecast. With the exception of the EGPC revenue, Al Arabi asserted that revenues will meet projections and that the shortfall from EGPC taxes could be made up by better than expected revenues from taxes on treasury bills and bonds, which are taxable for the first time this year.    5. (SBU) Al Arabi said that the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 stalled well-advanced plans to replace the sales and consumption taxes with a unified Value Added Tax (VAT), and that he did not envision much progress in that area until after the 2010 Parliamentary elections and the 2011 Presidential election. He explained that some articles of the new law might still be passed even if the complete reform could not yet be addressed.    6. (SBU) Al Arabi told us that tax collection procedures had improved substantially, particularly for corporate taxpayers, and that the GOE had made progress in closing loopholes and incentives for tax evasion. Tax preparers are now jointly liable with their clients for information provided in tax returns. This has removed much of the incentive for accountants to evade rather than comply with the law. He said that the Tax Authority still has major compliance issues with small and mid-sized businesses, many of whom deal strictly in cash and lack many of the formal legal and accounting structures that would aid in tax collection. He estimated that the government's tax revenues currently amount to 13-14% of GDP, but that by taxing the large informal economy, this could rise to 20%.    --------------------------------------------- -------------------  Improvements in Data Collection Are the Key  --------------------------------------------- -------------------    7. (SBU) El Arabi, who has been in his current position for a little less than three years, comes from a private sector accounting and auditing background. He stated that the reorganization he has done in the Tax Authority has proven difficult. He pointed to the example of consolidating the 64 "tax regions" that had previously existed into the 15 regions that exist today. This consolidation removed a great deal of redundant bureaucracy, but also limited promotion possibilities for Tax Authority employees. He said successes in automation and segmentation meant that the Tax Authority was "no longer a soft administration" within the government.    8. (SBU) Al Arabi credited US assistance through USAID with much of the progress in both automation and training within the Tax Authority. He added that further progress in tax collection will be reliant on the quality of information gathered and the proper analysis of that data. He said he plans to create an "internal inspection unit" and will build an "intelligence center" for data collection and verification.    -------------  Comment  -------------    9. (SBU) Lower revenues and higher budget deficits remain a worry both for Egyptian policy makers and the rest of the financial community. Egypt does, however, appear to be on track to meet its tax revenue projections for the year. As reported septel, the spending side of the equation is less promising, as greater than expected expenditures on subsidy programs and fiscal stimulus packages continue to put a strain on the overall budget.  Public discontent with many of the measures proposed by Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali, including the real estate tax,  continues to   be reflected in the press and among some members of the Parliament. However, all indications are that Boutros Ghali continues to have the support of the President, and the much needed fiscal reforms he has been promoting will continue, though perhaps at a slower pace.

(S) Summary:  In a frank one-hour meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad, Senators Gregg, Bayh, Specter, Enzi, Cornyn, and Klobuchar affirmed Washington's interest in better U.S.-Syrian relations and pushed Asad to take positive steps as well.  The senators urged Syria to move forward on security cooperation with the U.S. on Iraq, facilitating the release of three detained Americans in Iran, and re-opening the Damascus Community School.  Asad welcomed the prospect of more Congressional visits and candid exchanges, saying diplomacy had failed to solve the region's problems during the last two decades.  --  On comprehensive peace, Asad reiterated Syria's strong desire to return to Turkish-facilitated indirect talks with Israel as a means to establish agreed terms of reference for direct negotiations.  Syria's relations with Iran should not be linked to Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.  Syria's ties to Hamas, Hizballah, and other groups could be satisfactorily resolved only after the achievement of a comprehensive regional peace, Asad maintained.  --  The U.S. and Syria should use the next several months to improve bilateral relations so that both sides could overcome mutual distrust that would hinder U.S. credibility as an honest broker, Asad told the senators.  Later in the discussion, FM Muallim argued the onus for taking the next positive step lay with the U.S.  Syria could not move on issues such as the American school or the Cultural Center unless Washington lifted its ban on the sale of new commercial aircraft to Syria.  --   Calling Iran the region's most important country, Asad said the West could improve the prospects for peace by acknowledging Iran's NPT-protected right to enrich uranium under IAEA monitoring.  Asad argued the West should accept Iran's "reasonable" counter-offer to ship several batches of low-enriched uranium (LEU) abroad for enrichment by other countries, instead of insisting Iran ship all of its LEU at once.  Asad said he believed Iran was not interested in pursuing a nuclear weapon, but warned that an Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure would fail to disable the program and would only increase Iran's determination.  End Summary.  --------------------------------------------- -- Doctor Asad:  Treat, Don't Condemn, the Illness --------------------------------------------- --  2.  (S)  A confident President Asad greeted the six visiting senators and accompanying staff of CODEL Gregg on December 30 with a call for frank discussion of "the facts" rather than an exchange of opinions.  Only the facts, he said, would enable both sides to focus on the critical issues of common interest and lead to a process of identifying solutions to shared challenges.  The international community had failed for two decades to solve the region's problems.  Now, there were new challenges on top of these that required direct, not diplomatic, solutions.  He welcomed the delegation, saying he hoped for more meetings with Congressional groups.  3.  (S) Senator Specter expressed the delegation's condolences after the death of the President's younger brother Majd and recalled his numerous meetings with President Asad since their first meeting in 2000 at the funeral of former Syrian President Hafez al-Asad.  Senator Specter referred to his earlier discussions with Syrian officials about Israeli-Syrian peace talks and suggested  DAMASCUS 00000008  002 OF 006   Israel would benefit from peace with Syria.  The U.S. recognized Syria's deep and long-standing ties to Iran, but it also saw dangers if Iran acquired nuclear weapons. Stipulating that the Israeli government would have to make its own decisions on how to proceed in peace talks with Syria without U.S. pressure, Specter suggested the U.S. would positively view Syrian efforts to use its influence to alter Iranian policies.  Iranian policies currently opposed the achievement of peace between Syria and Israel, even as Syria recognized such a development would have a positive impact on defusing other regional tensions.  4.  (S)  Asad asserted he wanted peace with Israel, but the issues were complex and required an organized frame of reference.  Both sides might agree on the shared objective of peace, but they differed on preferred approaches.  Calling for a fact-based approach to identifying the obstacles to peace, Asad likened the process to how a doctor should treat cancer.  Condemnations and mutual recriminations might be self-satisfying, but the cancer still grows unless the doctor is able to treat the root illness.  Syria, Asad continued, had begun indirect peace talks with Israel in May 2008 under Turkish auspices.  In roughly eight months, these talks had achieved more than several years of direct negotiations with Israel in the 1990s.  The U.S. and Europeans needed to support the Turkish track, argued Asad.  They also should convince Israel that only peace will protect Israel. Israel's military superiority would not secure it from attack against missiles and other technologies.  President Obama's tenure might represent the last opportunity for peace, Asad told the senators.  ----------------------------------------- Asad on Necessity of Indirect Peace Talks -----------------------------------------  5.  (S)  Senator Gregg asked why Syria insisted on pursuing indirect peace talks via the Turks.  Why couldn't Syria and Israel move to direct talks brokered by the U.S., while Syria helped on issues important to the U.S., such as Hizballah, Hamas, and relations with Iran?  Asad replied Hamas and Hizballah should be a part of the peace, but not organizing principles for conducting peace discussions.  Syria, as demonstrated by then-lead negotiator Muallim's efforts in the 1990s, had no problems with direct negotiations.  But those negotiations failed; failing again might foreclose future opportunities.  U.S. ambitions to push the peace process forward only resulted in spoiling the process because of the lack of "rules of negotiation."  Indirect talks represent the best way to establish terms of reference similar to those reached by Secretary Baker during his intense shuttle diplomacy in 1991.  While no one called these talks indirect negotiations, they functioned comparably to Syria's indirect talks under Turkish auspices.  6.  (S)  Syria, Asad continued, saw the indirect talks as a way to institutionalize the process and reach agreed terms of reference on which to base direct negotiations.  This basis was absent in the 1990s and explained why the direct negotiations ultimately failed.  Referring to the "elephant in the room," Gregg asked whether it would be possible to reach peace with Israel without first resolving the Iranian nuclear issue.  Asad cautioned against linking Iran's nuclear program to an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, arguing such a link would only complicate both sets of issues.  "Too many cooks spoil the meal," he said.  Later in the conversation, however (in the context of a request for Syrian intervention with Iran to free detained American hikers), Asad noted every person and nation was key in bilateral and regional dynamics.  DAMASCUS 00000008  003 OF 006    Syria had cut relations with the U.S. after the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, but bilateral relations had improved markedly after President Nixon visited Syria in 1974 to discuss peace with Israel.  "That's our issue," he stressed, noting that the Golan track had been active under President Carter but then dormant through most of the 1980s and the early part of the current decade.  --------------------------------------------- --------- Iraq: Political Cooperation, Then Security Cooperation --------------------------------------------- ---------  7.  (S)  Senator Bayh observed that many things in Syria had changed for the better since his 2002 visit.  Now, there were positive indicators that bilateral relations might be on the upswing as well.  One area, however, in which relations had not improved was intelligence cooperation.  The U.S. and Syria appeared to have common interests in seeing a stable Iraq, not dominated by Iran.  Yet, foreign extremists continued to travel through Syria into Iraq.  The U.S. had provided information regarding four named individuals to the Syrian government, but nothing had happened.  Perhaps now was a propitious moment to consider re-establishing intelligence ties, Bayh suggested.  Asad concurred with the idea of overlapping U.S.-Syrian interests in Iraq.  He noted, however, that the main obstacle to increased U.S.-Syrian security cooperation stemmed from the absence of political cooperation.  The U.S. possessed a "huge information apparatus" but lacked the ability to analyze this information successfully, maintained Asad.  "You're failing in the fight against extremism.  While we lack your intelligence capabilities, we succeed in fighting extremists because we have better analysts," he claimed, attributing the superior analysis to living in and understanding the region.  8. (S)  Syria, Asad explained, had refused to cooperate with President Bush because it did not trust him and because the Bush Administration had wrongfully accused Syria of supporting foreign fighters.  When President Obama assumed office, Syria tried to be positive.  Asad he had proposed to Special Envoy Mitchell the idea of a border security cooperation initiative with Iraq as a first step.  (Post Comment: Asad's recollection is both selective and inaccurate.  U.S. officials first proposed a border security cooperation initiative to a reluctant FM Muallim in May 2009.  President Asad agreed to participate after meeting S/E Mitchell in late July 2009.)  "This was a small step for me, but big for you," Asad argued.  Citing the U.S. inability to control its long border with Mexico, Asad said the border was not the major challenge.  Syria's close intelligence cooperation with Turkey enabled both countries to prevent terrorists from crossing their 860-kilometer border without relying on a huge border security presence.  This intelligence cooperation enabled Syria to "suffocate" logistical networks critical to the movement of terrorists. "In the U.S., you like to shoot (terrorists).  Suffocating their networks is far more effective," said Asad.  9.  (S)  Asad said Syria required a positive first step prior to resuming intelligence cooperation, a position that Senator Mitchell had accepted.  Syria had succeeded in convincing Iraqi PM Maliki on August 18 to reverse its opposition to the trilateral border security initiative and was ready to participate.  After the August 19 bombings and Iraqi accusations against Syria for facilitating the terrorist attacks, Syria remained willing to participate in the border assessments.  It was the U.S., Asad insisted, that had backed away.  Syria had no interest in supporting extremists, who weren't killing Americans but rather Iraqi civilians.  "That  DAMASCUS 00000008  004 OF 006   hurts us," Asad claimed.  U.S. "mistakes in Iraq" had cost Syria and the region a great deal.  Syria had out of self-interest sought to deter terrorists who popped up. Still, despite a shared interest with the U.S. in ensuring Iraqi stability, Syria would not immediately jump to intelligence cooperation without ensuring its own interests would be respected.  "I won't give it (intelligence cooperation) to you for free," he said.  Senator Bayh replied that the U.S. was working to normalize relations and considering positive steps to take along the way.  Syria, Asad commented, had been clear on how to start rebuilding relations.  "We didn't say no," he said, "but we have to build from an absence of trust."  ---------------------------------------- Asad:  Door Open to Iranian Nuclear Deal ----------------------------------------  10.  (S)  Senator Cornyn commented the most dire threat to regional peace stemmed from Iran's nuclear aspirations. Syrian interests could well suffer if there were a conflict between Israel and Iran and possibly others.  Asad replied no one could predict the course of a conflict; therefore, it was better to avoid one.  The Bush Administration took a political approach to Iran instead of dealing with the nuclear issue in the context of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Under the NPT, Iran enjoys the right to enrich uranium, provided there is IAEA monitoring.  Instead of trying to stop Iran's program, the international emphasis should shift to ensuring proper monitoring.  Iran had accepted the principle of enriching uranium outside of its borders.  Now the challenge was how to meet Iran's concern that shipping all of its LEU at once would risk not receiving any in return.  Asad claimed Iran sought only to enrich its uranium to 20 percent, well bellow the 95 percent threshold necessary for weapons-grade material.  If the international community agreed to divide Iran's shipments into four or five parts, Iran would be flexible, Asad argued.  In the meantime, Israel had to forget about attacking Iran.  Such a move would only encourage Iran to follow the path of India, Pakistan, and others in seeking a nuclear weapon.  Syria opposed this outcome, but viewed the only solution was to recognize Iran's rights and demonstrate flexibility in foreign enrichment, Asad said.  11.  (S)  Later in the conversation, Senator Specter argued Iran appeared to be blocking a deal.  Asad claimed Iranian diplomacy was now more flexible because the government was stronger and more confident after the 2009 elections.  Noting he had shared this assessment with French President Sarkozy, Asad said he judged Iran to be looking for cooperative signs.  Iran represented the most important country in the region, Asad assessed, ranking Turkey second and Syria third.  The U.S. had troops in Afghanistan and needed better relations with Iran.  Specter agreed the enrichment issue could be solved; Russia had offered to enrich Iranian uranium several years ago, subject to international monitoring.  Iran had answered yes, replied Asad, but the issue was how to proceed.  Iran's desire to divide the uranium shipments represented the only difference: if the West agreed, the issue would be solved.  There was an open door; if the nuclear issue could be solved, the peace process would proceed more easily.  But if conflict erupted, the regional context would become extremely complicated.  ------------------------------------ Discussion of Detained Amcits in Iran -------------------------------------   DAMASCUS 00000008  005 OF 006   12.  (S)  Senator Klobuchar commented that she had supported Barak Obama because of his promise to advance a new approach to international relations.  While there were no easy solutions in the region, the U.S. and Syria appeared to have overlapping interests in avoiding war and in ensuring a strong and stable Iraq.  From the U.S. perspective, Syria might demonstrate as a goodwill gesture its interest in better relations by helping obtain the release of three American citizens -- Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd -- who apparrently crossed into Iran while hiking in northeastern Iraq.  Swiss officials had visited them, but they were isolated and the U.S. lacked information on their whereabouts and any pending charges.  13.  (S)  Asad replied he was unfamiliar with their case and requested that the Embassy send more information.  Senator Specter interjected later in the conversation that the Embassy had delivered a letter to the MFA that week from the Secretary.  Specter added he had personally raised the matter in Washington with Syrian Ambassador Imad Mustafa.  The U.S. would view positively Syrian efforts to secure the three Americans' release, Specter said, comparing the case to the Iranian detention of UK sailors whom Syria helped to free. "We'll try our best," replied Asad, saying it would be necessary to ask about the legal aspects of the case. Specter clarified there had been no charges filed.  It had started as a trespassing case, but U.S.-Iranian relations were so poor it was impossible to resolve.  --------------------------------------------- --- Re-Opening DCS:  Syria Awaiting U.S. Steps First --------------------------------------------- ---  13.  (S)  Senator Klobuchar and Senator Enzi argued Syria might demonstrate good will by re-opening the Damascus Community School (DCS), whose closure had hurt not just American students, but also many foreigners and Syrians. Senator Enzi said his committee's purview on education created a personal interest in seeing the DCS re-opened; the school's closure represented a step away from moving towards positive relations.  Asad replied he wanted to open Syria to the rest of the world.  In September 2008, for example, the French Embassy opened a new international school.  Asad explained he had ordered DCS's closure after a U.S. military attack on Syrian soil had killed seven innocent civilians in late October 2008.  "We had to respond," he argued, saying the school's closure "was the only step we could take" in response to the Bush Administration.  President Carter, Asad continued, had urged the reopening of DCS during his December 2008 visit.  "I told Carter that we are ready," said Asad, who noted the Syrian government wanted to send positive signals to the Obama administration and had done so by re-opening the American Cultural Center (ACC).  14. (S) FM Muallim noted that only part of the American Language Center portion of ACC had been allowed to re-open. He argued that he and other Syrian officials had told State Department officials that steps by Syria to improve relations first required U.S. steps.  "We can't move without a waiver for Syrian Airlines," he argued, citing the threat to Syrian civilians posed a U.S. ban on the sale of civilian aircraft and spare parts.  Asad noted that a good friend who ran a medical laboratory was similarly unable to import U.S. lab technology.  The bigger issue, Asad said, was about bilateral relations.  Syria's intent was to re-open the DCS.  Asad said he trusted President Carter and supported President Obama. "We know he has other problems and priorities, but there must be U.S. steps," Asad insisted.   DAMASCUS 00000008  006 OF 006   15.

C O N F I D E N T I A L DOHA 000070  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2020 TAGS: PREL KWBG KPAL IR QASUBJECT: SENATOR KERRY'S MEETING WITH QATAR'S AMIR  Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d).  -------------- (C) KEY POINTS --------------  --  The Amir of Qatar urged the U.S. in his February 14 meeting with Senator John Kerry (D-MA) to do everything in its power to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The Amir said the best way to begin is by moving first on the Syrian track.  --  In Qatar's view, now is the time to reach out to Damascus.  The Syrian Government can help Arab extremists make tough choices, but only if the U.S., whose involvement is essential, demonstrates to Syria early on a willingness to address the return of the Golan Heights and supports Turkey's mediation efforts between Israel and Syria.  --  According to the Amir, Hamas will accept the 1967 border with Israel, but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular Palestinian support.  --  The Egyptians' goal, according to the Amir, is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the U.S., which is built around brokering regional peace, for as long as possible.  --  The Amir recommended that the U.S. and Qatar establish a small bilateral committee to discuss how to advance regional peace.  Qatar can help move Hamas, because Qatar does not "play in their internal politics."  That does not mean Qatar shares Hamas' ideology, stressed the Amir.  --  On Iran, the Amir said President Ahmadinejad is strong because he is uncorrupted.  The Amir also advised the U.S. to continue ts efforts to open a dialogue with the Iranian ladership.  End Key Points.  1. (C)  Senator Joh Kerry (D-MA), the Chairman of the Senate Foreig Relations Committee(SFRC), joined by Ambassador,P/E Chief, and SFRC staff member Dr. Jonah Blank met February 14 with the Amir of Qatar, Hamad bn Khalifa Al Thani.  The meeting took place at Waba Palace, the residence of the Amir, and the Amir began the meeting by pointing out that the comfortable chairs on which the U.S. party was seated were made in Syria.  ------------------------------ IMPORTANCE OF THE SYRIAN TRACK ------------------------------  2. (C) This opening led Senator Kerry to remark that he had held great discussions with Syria's President, Bashar Al-Asad, when he met him in Damascus some months ago.  The Amir said President Asad is committed to "big change," but Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri's death and complications resulting from Syria's alleged involvement in it had brought about "complications" for Asad.  The Amir added that "Bashar is still young and can grow."  3. (C) Senator Kerry said he took away from his visit to Damascus that Asad wants change.  The Amir added that the Syrian President also wants peace with Israel and that the arrival of a U.S. Ambassador in Damascus would help in this regard.  Senator Kerry said he had wanted a U.S. Ambassador in Syria a year ago, but agreed that the naming of an Ambassador is a positive development.  4. (C) The Amir cautioned that the Syrians will not accept everything the U.S. proposes, stressing that the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights continues and that the return of this land to Syria is paramount for Damascus.  The Amir observed that the "Syrians have lost confidence in the U.S. and that the Israelis now have the upper hand in the region because of the support of the United States."  The Israeli leaders need to represent the people of Israel, who themselves do not trust Arabs.  The Amir said this is understandable and "we can't blame them" because the Israelis have been "under threat" for a long time.  5. (C) What has changed, continued the Amir, is that Arabs "for sure" now want two states -- Israel and Palestine.  When you consider that many in the region perceive that Hizballah drove Israel out of Lebanon and Hamas kicked them (at least initially) out "of the small piece of land called Gaza," it is actually surprising that the Israelis still want peace. The region, however, is still "far away" from peace, concluded the Amir.  6. (C) Senator Kerry responded that in his long experience with the region, it was not unusual for people to take positions adverse to their own interests.  Yasser Arafat went from living as a terrorist in Tunisia to signing an agreement with Israel on the White House lawn.  The transformation of Arafat is an example of how actors in the region need to take risks if we are to move forward in advancing regional peace. Turning the conversation back to Syria, Chairman Kerry pointed out that Syria's facilitation of arms to Hizballah and its turning a blind eye to missile upgrades in Lebanon do not represent risk-taking in the promotion of peace.  7. (C) The Amir pointed out that any progress toward regional peace had come about due to American involvement.  He implied that it would take U.S. intervention on the Syrian-Israeli track to address these issues and asked Senator Kerry what he would have Damascus do.  8. (C) The Chairman responded that President Asad needs to make a bolder move and take risks.  He observed that if the Syrian President wants peace and economic development for his country, he needs to be more statesman-like, which would in turn help Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu engage him.  9. (C) The Amir agreed with Senator Kerry's assessment of Asad's aims and said he is ready for peace, but asked if the Israelis are ready.  Would Israel accept to resume Turkey's mediation between Syria and Israel?  Would the U.S. play a role in advancing the Syria track?  10. (C) If we can get Abu Mazen back to the negotiating table, we can engage on border issues -- including Israel's borders with Syria, advised Senator Kerry.  Abu Mazen right now is not strong enough, though, to make necessary compromises with Israel because the Palestinian people have wanted him to stick to his guns on a settlement freeze and the Goldstone Report.  The Chairman added that Netanyahu also needs to compromise and work the return of the Golan Heights into a formula for peace.  11. (C) The Amir encouraged the U.S. to work the Golan Heights issue first.  He stressed that Syrians are very different from Iranians in "mentality," and said the Syrians turned to Iran for support only because they had nowhere else to go.  Now is the time, the Amir told Senator Kerry, to reach out to Damascus.  ------------------------- PARAMETERS FOR DISCUSSION -------------------------  12. (C) Senator Kerry responded that the U.S. is prepared to play a strong role in bringing about peace in the region. President Obama, said the Chairman, understands that he personally must engage and do so strongly.  The Senator told the Amir that in his speech to the U.S.-Islamic Forum the previous evening, the Senator had focused on former President Clinton's parameters for peace and the 2002 Arab League peace initiative.  Now, said the Senator, is the time to put those back on the table and resume talking, with the U.S. acting as a legitimate agent of peace.  Chairman Kerry told the Amir he is convinced that we can see great progress in the coming year by moving swiftly from proximity talks, to direct talks between the parties and ending with final status discussions.   13. (C) To be successful, continued Senator Kerry, we must begin by agreeing at the outset the amount of land each side (Israelis and Palestinians) will obtain in the end and use that understanding to draw the borders.  If both sides make good compromises, we can address the settlement issues in the context of giving something up so that the borders, when drawn, contain the agreed-upon amounts of land for both sides.  The Amir agreed with the Senator's assessment and complimented President Obama for being the first U.S. President to take on the Middle East conflict in the first year of his term.  14. (C) Continuing the presentation of his ideas on the parameters of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Senator Kerry noted that one of the biggest problems for Israel is the potential return of 5-6 million Palestinian refugees.  The parties broached the return issue in discussions at Taba and agreed that the right of Palestinian return would be subject to later negotiation, pointed out the Chairman.  If we can proceed from that point on the right of return, the Senator believes there is an "artful way" to frame the negotiations on borders, land swaps, and Jerusalem as a shared capital. 15. (C) Any negotiation has its limits, added Senator Kerry, and we know for the Palestinians that control of Al-Aqsa mosque and the establishment of some kind of capital for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem are not negotiable.  For the Israelis, the Senator continued, Israel's character as a Jewish state is not open for negotiation.  The non-militarization of an eventual Palestinian state and its borders can nonetheless be resolved through negotiation.  16. (C) The Amir underscored that Abu Mazen needs Arab support to make the above happen.  Hamas "for sure," he said, will accept the 1967 border but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular Palestinian support.  --------------------------- DEALING WITH THE EXTREMISTS ---------------------------  17. (C) Senator Kerry told the Amir he knew Qatar could help the U.S. but asked how we deal with those who advocate violence.  The Amir said the short answer is to work the Syrian track, which means pushing for Israel's return of the Golan Heights to Syria.  The Amir said return of the Golan is important not just to Syria but also to Hizballah and Iran. The U.S. must bear in mind that Misha'al, a leader of Hamas based in Damascus, has drawn the conclusion that the Oslo accords were bad for Arafat.  He lost the support of his own people and died living under Israeli siege.  The Syrians can help Misha'al and others make tough choices, but only if the U.S. demonstrates to Syria early on a willingness to address the Golan.  Senator Kerry responded that the U.S. would accept a legitimate discussion of the Golan Heights.  18. (C) What is more, said the Amir, the U.S. needs to support Turkey's mediation between Israel and Syria.  It is important that the U.S. encourage Israel to understand that that resolving the status of the Golan Heights is very important to the United States.  19. (C) Senator Kerry asked the Amir if Hamas is under pressure given the circumstances in Gaza.  The Amir answered by saying that Hamas needs Iranian support.  He added that the biggest misconception in the region is that the Syrians, who host Hamas leaders in Damascus, go to Iran because they like the Iranians.  This is wrong.  Syria goes to those who will not shun them.  ------------- ROLE OF EGYPT -------------  20. (C) Returning to the pressure Hamas is facing, Senator Kerry observed that economic development in the West Bank is taking place, but not in Gaza.  The Palestinian reconciliation that would make possible developmental assistance in Gaza has not happened.  The Egyptians have not delivered, said Senator Kerry.  21. (C) The Amir said the Egyptians' goal is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the U.S., which is built around brokering Middle East peace, for as long as possible.  According to the Amir, Fatah and Hamas agreed on a memorandum of understanding, but the Egyptians wanted it changed.  The Amir remarked that he has a feeling he knows which capital (Cairo) is the source of reports that Gaza is under pressure.  He said the economic pressure in Gaza on families is not what it was.  He offered as an example that Qatar Charity recently offered a family in Gaza 500 USD, but the family declined the gift saying its members had enough to get by and suggested another family that was in more dire need of assistance.  The Amir said the notion that a family would turn down money is new.  22. (C) The Amir told Senator Kerry that everyone knows "Egypt has a problem with the Muslim Brotherhood.  Okay, we understand.  But Egypt should not expect the world to take external actions that would help it internally."  23. (C) Asked his advice for President Obama, the Amir recommended the establishment of a small U.S.-Qatar committee to discuss how to proceed.  Qatar is close to Hamas, emphasized the Amir, because "we don't play in their internal politics."  That does not mean we share their ideology or do not disagree with them.  "I can remember many arguments with them (Hamas) on the 1967 border with Israel."  The Amir noted that he had mediated with Hamas previously at the U.S. request, namely when he urged Hamas at the previous Administration's request to participate in Palestinian elections.  24. (C) Returning to the leadership of Hamas, Senator Kerry asked the Amir for his insights into how the leadership, with leaders sitting in both Gaza and Syria, makes decisions.  The Amir said the impression that Misha'al sits in Damascus and others take orders from him is wrong.  Several key players within Hamas are involved in decisions.  They have differences over policy, but "the bottom line is that they all want the Palestinians to take their rights from Israel."  ---- IRAN ----  25. (C) Senator Kerry observed that the international community is moving toward imposing additional economic sanctions on Iran.  Understanding and respecting that Qatar needs to balance its relationships with regional powers, including Iran, the Chairman asked the Amir for his perspective on where we are going on Iran.  26. (C) The Amir answered by affirming that his first obligation is to defend the interests of Qatar.  Due to the natural gas field Iran shares with Qatar, Qatar will not "provoke a fight" with Iran.  He added that in the history of the two countries, "Iran has not bothered us."  That said, the Amir noted that Iran is an important country in the Middle East.  He faulted the U.S. for "making the mistake of speaking up for protesters" after the disputed Iranian presidential elections.  27. (C) The Iranian regime is strong, continued the Amir, because President Ahmadinejad is uncorrupted.  "That is the secret to his success."  Khatami is also not corrupted, but as a reformer he is in a weak position.  Rafsanjani, on the other hand, is corrupt.  28. (C) Senator Kerry lamented that every communication the current Administration has attempted to the Government of Iran has gone back channel and been met with no response. There have been non-U.S. initiatives, too.  Again, no success.  The Chairman observed that the Iranians are scared to talk. The Supreme Ayatollah had met with Russian President Putin, but seems not inclined to meet with other political leaders.  Our instinct is that we need to find a way to talk to him.  29. (C) Your instinct is right, replied the Amir.  The U.S. needs to talk directly with senior Iranian officials.  The Amir then asked, "What if I talk to the Iranian President. What would you have me say?"  30. (C) Senator Kerry responded, "The U.S. seeks serious discussion and sought to create a new foundation for a relationship based on Iran's non-confrontational compliance with IAEA requirements and other mutual interests."  Those interests include dealing with drug-running, the Taliban, and illicit trade.  The Chairman told the Amir he feared that Iran still thinks it is dealing with the 1953 America that tried to overthrow the Iranian government.  31. (C) The Amir responded that you cannot blame them for having that attitude, and Senator Kerry agreed, adding that the U.S. has a very different posture in the post-Cold War world of today.  Iran has ambitions; I know this from other regional leaders, said the Senator.  These are the first words that come out of their mouths.  32. (C) Iran wants to be a "big power," agreed the Amir, but what sort?  He reminded Senator Kerry the U.S. should not forget that Iranians are Persian and the U.S. needs to approach them in that framework.  33. (C) Senator Kerry stressed that the U.S. "would love to have that dialogue."  The U.S. respects Iranian civilization -- talent, art, culture, etc.  It is crazy to continue on this collision course.  The region needs schools and jobs, emphasized the Chairman, not another war.  The Amir agreed that "demographics are a big worry."  Not just for the countries in the region but for the U.S. too.  34. (C) Many scientific and technological transformations are underway, noted the Senator, "but Iran misinterprets the road to being a great power and the degree to which the international community is concerned about Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons."  We are at a "fork in the road," and Iran must choose between confrontation or building partnerships.  If the latter, we can open up new opportunities for cooperation in the sciences, technology, education, robotics, energy and other ongoing transformations.  35. (C) Going back to the speech he had delivered in Doha the previous evening, Senator Kerry told the Amir that 17 former U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense had come out in favor of eliminating nuclear weapons.  Every stop closer to realizing that goal is a sign of progress, but "no one believes Iranian nukes get us closer to that goal."  36. (C) Senator Kerry reported that leaders of regional Arab countries tell me they want nuclear weapons if the Iranians have them.  The Amir responded that he did not believe they were serious, but are saying this to put additional pressure on Iran.  37. (C) The Chairman noted that the disputed Iranian presidential elections may have derailed U.S. efforts to have serious dialogue with Tehran.  The Amir agreed, offering that the Israelis are also using Iran's quest for nuclear weapons as a diversion from settling matters with the Palestinians. The historical backdrop of Arab-Persian relations does not help, the Amir added.  -------------- FINAL THOUGHTS --------------  38. (C) The Amir advised the U.S. to continue trying to open a dialogue with the Iranian leadership.  He also told Senator Kerry the U.S. needs to tell the Israelis they are causing the U.S. to lose the hearts and minds of Muslims.  There was a time, such as during the Suez Canal crisis, when the Arabs loved the Americans and disliked the British and French, he said.  39. (C) Senator Kerry asked the Amir how the U.S. goes about changing its reputation.  The Amir said first and foremost the U.S. must do everything in its power to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the best way to begin is by moving first on the Syrian track.  40. (C) The Chairman of the SFRC said he expects a genuine effort by the President this year on an agreement and expressed his hope that Iranian issues would not complicate matters.  The Amir agreed, adding that China likes the distraction for the U.S. as its forces fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  41. (C) Senator Kerry concurred, noting that China is lending the U.S. money and expanding its influence at U.S. expense. He added that he ran against President George W. Bush saying the war with Iraq was the wrong war in the wrong place and time.  42. (C) The Amir closed the meeting by offering that based on 30 years of experience with the Iranians, they will give you 100 words.  Trust only one of the 100.  43. (U) CODEL Kerry has cleared this message.  Lebaron

LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d).  -------------- (C) KEY POINTS --------------  --  Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (HBJ) told Senator John Kerry February 13 that we will all lose us 4-6 months of time in pursuing the recently announced "proximity talks" between the Israelis and Palestinians.  --  HBJ underscored that it is a mistake to ignore Hamas in seeking a lasting agreement.  --  From Qatar's perspective, there are differences in style and approaches between the two wings of Hamas, but in principle both are fundamentally aligned.

Giving Syria a role would create jealousy among the Arabs, which HBJ said would help the U.S. move talks forward.  --  HBJ said putting economic pressure on Iran by targeting its oil revenues is the best way to get Tehran to rethink its quest for nuclear weapons.  For the sanctions to work, it would be vital that Russia and other countries bordering Iran implement them fully.  End Key Points.  1. (C)  The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), Senator John Kerry (D-MA), accompanied by Ambassador, P/E Chief and SFRC staff Frank Lowenstein and Fatema Sumar, met February 13 with Prime Minister (and Foreign Minister) of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (HBJ).  HBJ opened the meeting by observing that President Obama's presidency had brought a lot of optimism to the region.  Senator Kerry agreed, adding that now we "need to deliver."  --------------------------- PROXIMITY TALKS NOT HELPFUL ---------------------------  2. (C) HBJ expressed dissatisfaction that "everyone in the region" seems to have a separate plan for moving ahead on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute when only one plan was needed -- a plan that both the Israelis and Palestinians would accept and finalize.  More disconcerting to Qatar, he said, was the announcement by Special Envoy Mitchell that both parties would now engage in "proximity talks."  Such talks "will lose us 4-6 months of time," stated HBJ.  3. (C) Senator Kerry responded that we "are where we are." He assessed that the Goldstone Report and dissatisfaction in Fatah's ranks in the West Bank made it difficult for Abu Mazen to "give something to Israel" that would allow direct negotiations to begin between the parties.  Add in Abu Mazen's previous statements on the need for a full settlement freeze, and the ingredients for the Palestinian people to accept direct talks simply are not there.  4. (C) Abu Mazen is out on a limb, responded HBJ.  "He climbed a tree (drawing a line in the sand on settlements) and can't get down."  HBJ suggested that President Obama's address to the UN General Assembly at the opening of its current session could serve as a "roadmap" forward:  two states (Israel and Palestine) remain the goal, and the establishment of settlements must stop while negotiations take place.  HBJ stressed again that the "proximity talks" will cause a "lot of problems."  ----------------------------------- NEED FOR PALESTINIAN RECONCILIATION -----------------------------------  5. (C) HBJ told Chairman Kerry he had met recently in Doha with an Israeli delegation and had encouraged them to work with Palestinians of all stripes in the pursuit of peace. HBJ underscored that it is a mistake to work with just one partner, Fatah, and ignore Hamas.  Saying this does not mean  DOHA 00000071  002 OF 004   that Qatar expresses a preference for Hamas.  HBJ pointed out that Abu Mazen had taught in Qatar for 30 years and remains a friend of Qatar.  Qatar has no differences with him or those around him, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) cannot sign off on an agreement on behalf of the Palestinians where open divisions exist.  6. (C) HBJ noted that in conversations Qatar has held with Hamas' leadership, it is clear that Hamas is ready to accept Israel's right to exist.  But the acceptance must come about gradually, not in one day.  Senator Kerry said he had heard this elsewhere, but in his own conversations in Damascus -- where a many leaders of Hamas reside -- he did not get the sense that Hamas was ready to accept Israel's existence.  7. (C) Qatar's PM observed that the biggest obstacle on the Palestinian side to an eventual agreement with Israel is the reconciliation of Hamas and Fatah.  HBJ maintained that it would have happened during the previous U.S. administration, but President Bush told Abu Mazen not to sign off on it. Now, said HBJ, progress is slow, and bringing the two parties together in the spirit of reconciliation is hampered by Arab politics.  Reconciliation can happen, HBJ asserted, but only "if bigger countries in the region allow it."  8, (C) Senator Kerry, noting that he had seen Yasser Arafat make the transition from PLO fighter to signer of an agreement on the White House lawn, observed that people can come around and change their position.  But was that the case here?  The Senator asked HBJ if the differences at play between Hamas' leaders in Damascus and Gaza were too wide to bridge.  9. (C) From HBJ's perspective, there are differences in style and approaches between the two wings of Hamas, but in principle both are fundamentally aligned.  They can accept recognition of Israel, but have to calibrate the timing very carefully because Hamas knows that its supporters in the Palestinian territories are not ready for this change.  HBJ said Hamas leaders in Damascus and Gaza are aligned on wanting to open the border crossing at Rafah, for example, but differ on tactics in reaching this goal.  The leaderships in Syria and Gaza consult each other, and no one leader in Hamas can take a decision alone, reported HBJ.  -------------------------------------------- EGYPT INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS, NOT RESULTS --------------------------------------------  10. (C) Chairman Kerry asked HBJ if Hamas is feeling political pressure from Gazans over their current living conditions.  HBJ responded that anytime people do not have housing, schools or public utilities, their political leaders feel pressure.  Hamas, however, has a greater sense of urgency in reconciling with Fatah, observed HBJ, than does the broker of the talks between the Palestinian parties.  11. (C) According to HBJ, Egypt -- the broker -- has a vested interest in dragging out the talks for as long as possible. Egypt "has no end game; serving as broker of the talks is Egypt's only business interest with the U.S."  HBJ likened the situation to a physician who has only one patient to treat in the hospital.  If that is your only business, "the physician is going to keep the patient alive but in the hospital for as long as possible."  HBJ emphasized that Qatar, on the other hand, is interested only in bringing about peace in the region -- and as quickly as possible.  12. (C) Short term, HBJ said Hamas wants to form with Fatah a unity government and rebuild the Israeli-inflicted damage in Gaza.  Senator Kerry, steering the conversation toward Hamas' long-term aims, acknowledged that Qatar's leaders speak frequently with Hamas.  The Chairman asked HBJ to explain why Hamas does not seem "to move when we need Hamas to move."  13. (C) Simply put, answered HBJ, "Hamas does not trust Egypt and the Quartet enterprise."  HBJ noted that since its inception the Quartet has been anti-Hamas and aligned with the interests of Abu Mazen, Egypt and Jordan.  These partners of the Quartet, observed HBJ, are the very partners who have not delivered a Palestinian-Israeli agreement.  14. (C) Returning to his theme that "peace brokers" act in their own self-interest, HBJ observed that President Mubarak of Egypt is thinking about how his son can take his place and how to stave off the growing strength of the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Egyptian government, said HBJ, has jailed 10,000 Muslim Brotherhood members without bringing court cases against them.  The Egyptian "people blame America" now for their plight.  The shift in mood on the ground is "mostly because of Mubarak and his close ties" to the United States.  DOHA 00000071  003 OF 004   His only utility to the U.S. is brokering peace between Palestinians and Israelis, so he has no interest in taking himself out of the one game he has, underscored HBJ.  "Tell your friends (in Egypt) they must help themselves."  15. (C) As for Qatar, "We want to help Abu Mazen and the Palestinians," declared HBJ.  The short-term needs of Palestinians in Gaza are acute, said HBJ.  We need to broker a quick reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and move forward quickly on rebuilding Gaza.  Senator Kerry asserted that HBJ was preaching to the converted and told the PM he was "shocked by what I saw in Gaza."  16. (C) Continuing to illustrate how Egypt had not delivered for the U.S. on Palestinian issues, HBJ said Qatar was told in late 2008 that Israel and the U.S. needed the Egyptians to deal with the crisis in Gaza.  Yet former Israeli PM Olmert later complained to Qatar that Egypt is a big country and not nimble; it could not move fast enough.  Senator Kerry pointed out he was in Cairo at the time Qatar was calling for an Arab League Summit in December 2008/January 2009 and asked HBJ for his perspective on the rift between Qatar and Egypt at that time.  17. (C) HBJ told Senator Kerry that Mubarak refused to come to Doha for a meeting of Arab leaders, preferring that the meeting take place in Riyadh.  The request to move the meeting was relayed to Qatar by the Saudis, not the Egyptians.  Saudi Arabia, as a big country like Egypt, has a vested interest in keeping Egypt afloat, said HBJ.  The Saudis agreed to host the meeting in Riyadh not because they objected to traveling to Doha, but because the Egyptians did.  "So we argued over the meeting location" while the Palestinians suffered, and we in Qatar "called a meeting and said whoever comes, comes."  18. (C) Qatar is worried, said HBJ, about Egypt and its people, who are increasingly impatient.  Mubarak, continued HBJ, says Al Jazeera is the source of Egypt's problems.  This is an excuse.  HBJ had told Mubarak "we would stop Al Jazeera for a year" if he agreed in that span of time to deliver a lasting settlement for the Palestinians. Mubarak said nothing in response, according to HBJ.  19. (C) Asked his advice on bringing about an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, HBJ said President Clinton recognized before leaving office that Egypt was a problem.  When President Clinton sought help at the end of his term in reaching a final deal, the Saudis and Egyptians did not encourage him, said HBJ.  "They told him to do what he thinks right."  Culturally, said HBJ, that is the way Arabs say "you are on your own."  And President Clinton was, said HBJ.  20. (C) Now we are at a stage, said HBJ, where Egypt does not want Arab League involvement in brokering a reconciliation agreement among the Palestinians unless the talks bog down. HBJ said he had told Abbas that climbing down from his tree on no settlement activity so that talks can go forward will require Arab support.  But the Egyptians won't allow it.  21. (C) Asked if tabling a more specific plan for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians would help, HBJ said it would be a mistake to table a plan that is too specific.  HBJ then reiterated that the problem is more with those carrying out the negotiations.  "The good cooks (Egypt) have not given good food to now."  22. (C) Senator Kerry noted that Special Envoy Mitchell had made a lot of requests of Arabs but with little success. Leaving Qatar aside, the Chairman asked HBJ for proposed next steps.  HBJ said he trusts the Saudis, but because they talk openly to Egypt and do not want to create more problems for Egypt than the Egyptian government already has, it is essential to bring in the small countries and start there.  23. (C) HBJ suggested one or two GCC members, Morocco (although the King there is hesitant) and Syria as the core membership of an Arab League committee to address Palestinian-Israeli concerns.  HBJ told Senator Kerry the inclusion of Syria might surprise him, but having Syria play a role would create jealousy among the Arabs.  Some jealously and rivalry is just what the U.S. needs, opined HBJ, to get the process moving.  ---------------- IRAN AND LEBANON ----------------  24. (C) Turning to Iran, Senator Kerry said he understood Qatar's need to find the right balance in dealing with bigger  DOHA 00000071  004 OF 004   neighbors, especially Iran given the natural gas field both share.  Due to the working relationship Qatar maintains with Iran, the Chairman asked HBJ for his advice as the international community becomes more serious about economic sanctions against Iran.  25. (C) HBJ said Iran's president views the U.S. as a country that is overstretched and in difficulty as a result of too many commitments.  Iraq, Afghanistan, and the U.S. economy are the three main problems President Ahmadinejad sees.  HBJ observed that a Western attack against Iran for Ahmadinejad would be good politics, because it would allow him to take out his opposition using the war as a pretext.  Senator Kerry asked clarification of whether Ahmadinejad had said these things, or if HBJ inferred them from conversation.  26. (C) Qatar's PM said Ahmadinejad had told him, "We beat the Americans in Iraq; the final battle will be in Iran."  27. (C) HBJ said putting economic pressure on Iran is the best way to get the leadership to rethink its quest for nuclear weapons.  To be successful, he told Senator Kerry, Russia would definitely have to be on board, as would the Central Asian countries bordering Iran that provide food and supplies.  28. (C) Asked his perception of the state of play with the opposition, HBJ said the U.S. had done a good job of standing back and not becoming the symbol of the opposition.  Cracks in the regime are appearing.  It is highly significant that many demonstrators ignored Khamenei when he called on them to stop their protests.  The four key pillars of Iranian power -- the court, oil sector, imams, and Revolutionary Guards --- all must stick with him, stressed HBJ.  There are cracks in the system, but the downfall of the regime may not be in the cards.  29. (C) Asked what the sanctions should target, HBJ said the money that Iran derives from oil.  Depriving Tehran of this revenue would force the regime to negotiate.  30. (C) Senator Kerry observed that Ahmadinejad was making it easier by his actions.  There is wide consensus in the Executive and Legislative branches of Washington to press ahead.  Senator Kerry warned that Ahmadinejad "should not equate Afghanistan and Iraq with what he faces."  31. (C) HBJ encouraged Chairman Kerry to bear in mind that Iran is clever and makes its opponents dizzy in the quest for deals.  They will keep you working on a deal and then start from scratch with a new interlocutor.  HBJ stressed that Iran will make no deal.  Iran wants nuclear weapons, and HBJ said he would not be surprised to see Iran test one to demonstrate to the world its achievement.  32. (C) On Lebanon, Senator Kerry asked if Iran and Hizballah are ratcheting up their weapons stockpiles as part of Iran's war against Israel.  HBJ affirmed that is the case.  ---- IRAQ ----  33. (C) On Iraq, HBJ told Senator Kerry that Prime Minister Al-Maliki wants a Shia state, even though the Sunnis (when you count Kurds and non-Kurds) have the majority.  34. (U) CODEL Kerry has cleared this message.  Lebaron

REF: A. (A) KABUL 673      B. (B) 09 KABUL 3068  Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Director Hoyt Yee for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)  1. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) Begin Summary.  Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) Frank Ruggiero met one-on-one with Ahmed Wali Karzai (AWK) on February 23.  SCR informed AWK that coalition attention will turn to Kandahar in the next phase of Operation Moshtarak (Together) and the United States will play a far greater role in Kandahar on the military and civilian sides.  SCR outlined the coalition governance strategy for Kandahar and cautioned ISAF will seek non-interference by powerbrokers in police matters.  AWK discussed the recent capture of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar in Kandahar, district and provincial-level politics, Kandahar economics and security, the role of Abdul Rahman Jan (ARJ) in Helmand, narcotics, a southern Pashtoon political party, competition with Nangarhar Governor Gulaga Sherzai, and AWK's life in Chicago from 1983-1992.  AWK appeared nervous, but eager to engage with a U.S. official.  End Summary.  Focus on Kandahar -----------------  2. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR told AWK the attention of the Afghan government, with ISAF support, would turn to Kandahar in the months ahead and it was likely this would be predominantly a political contest that would require the leadership from the highest level of the Afghan government. SCR discussed the governance strategy for Kandahar City and surrounding districts.  AWK understood the next phase of operation Moshtarak would be on Kandahar and offered his support.  SCR responded this would be an Afghan Government-led effort and the coalition would be focusing its resources on building up that capacity.  SCR was clear the coalition would not tolerate individuals working at odds to ISAF campaign aims.  AWK stated "nobody is that stupid."  Better Security and Economy in Kandahar ---------------------------------------  3. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) AWK told the SCR that security has improved in Kandahar over the past year.  Freedom of movement had increased across the province, he said, citing his driving to the meeting at Kandahar Airfield with minimum security.  AWK said insurgents no longer have the capability to launch large scale attacks; for example, AWK does not fear an insurgent attack on his home.  AWK expressed concern about a series of assassinations aimed at Afghan officials and Afghan citizens who work for the coalition in the city, noting this could only be solved by intelligence assets.  AWK said economic activity had increased in the Kandahar City area, but noted his belief that President Karzai is largely unaware of these gains.  AWK told the President about increased economic activity in Arghandab related to AVIPA Plus and the President was very surprised, he said.  AWK said the President did not understand the changing circumstances in the province.  Kandahar Politics Are Local ---------------------------  4. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) AWK said that it was important to get district-level tribal dynamics right to bring stability to Kandahar City and its environs.  AWK specifically stated the need to rely on local, village elders to choose representatives to district shuras.  This would ensure a representative shura for district level officials, said AWK and pointed to the succession of Arghandab-based Alikozai leader Mullah Naqib.  AWK said the Alikozais chose Mullah Naqib's son, Karimullah, to lead the Alikozai.  SCR pointed out coalition conventional wisdom that President Karzai had interfered in that process to appoint Karimullah, which led to certain Alikozai elements to support the Taliban in Arghandab.  AWK said, unconvincingly, this was not the case. AWK then contradicted himself and said Karimullah, in fact, did not lead the Alikozai, but AWK's deputy at the provincial council Dastegeeri, was the most influential Alikozai in Kandahar.  Police in the South and Abdul Rahman Jan ----------------------------------------  5. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR told AWK the coalition would not accept powerbroker interference with the police and used the example of citizens in Marjah telling Marines they would not  KABUL 00000693  002 OF 003   support GIRoA due to past Abdul Rahman Jan (ARJ) abuses when he was the Helmand police chief between 2003 and 2006.  AWK concurred ARJ was problematic.  SCR reiterated coalition would seek to make certain ARJ did not re-establish links to police officials in Marjah (Note: SCR brought this discussion up so that AWK would report it to Kabul. End Note.).  AWK said the Noorzais in Marjah would support ARJ, but other tribes would resist.  Kandahar does not have similar issues of interference with the police, he said, but SCR pressed saying we are aware of a recent incident when the Kandahar governor sought to remove the Panjwa'i chief of police, but someone had intervened to halt that removal.  AWK, who is believed to have prevented Governor Weesa from firing the police chief, said the governor had the power to remove police officials and should exercise that authority in Panjwa'i.  AWK characterized Governor Weesa as honest and a powerful figure in Kandahar, but he needed to be more aggressive.  In the same breath, AWK said he was the most powerful official in Kandahar and could deliver whatever is needed.  Capture of Mullah Baradar -------------------------  6. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR asked AWK his views on the recent capture in Pakistan of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar.  AWK said Pakistan detained Baradar and other Taliban leaders because they were prepared to discuss reintegration with the Karzai government.  Senior Taliban fighters in Pakistan may be prepared to reintegrate, he said, but are forced by the Pakistan Government to continue to fight.  AWK said some Afghan Taliban commanders cannot return to Afghanistan because they are on the Joint Priority Effects List (JPEL) and are told by the Pakistanis they must continue to fight or will be turned over to the coalition.  It is important to remove such fighters from the JPEL for reintegration to work, he argued, adding that he has been working on the reconciliation issue with the Saudis for two-three years. AWK offered a meeting with SCR and his older brother and former Member of Parliament for Kandahar Kayyum Karzai in the next few weeks to discuss ongoing reintegration discussions with the Saudis.  Drug Trafficker: Where is the Polygraph? ----------------------------------------  7. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) Unprompted, AWK raised allegations of his involvement in narcotics, telling the SCR that he is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence and that he has hired an attorney in New York to clear his name.  He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation.  AWK dismissed the narcotics allegations as part of a campaign to discredit him, particularly by the media, saying the allegations are "like a spice added to a dish to make it more enticing to eat."  A Political Party for Southern Pashtuns? -----------------------------------------  8. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR asked AWK if there are discussions to create a Pashtun-oriented political party in the South. AWK said such a party would be announced shortly and it would encompass southern Pashtuns from Herat to Kandahar; Tajiks also would be represented.  AWK said Afghans are reluctant to join political parties because they are associated with the communist party and Islamic fundamentalist movements, like the Taliban.  He added that he could not be part of another election because he had to personally manage promises to hundreds of thousands of voters in the last election.  Gulaga Sherzai: Competitor --------------------------  9. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR raised the recent 1,500 person shura co-hosted by AWK and Sherzai in Kandahar City (Reftel B).  AWK said Sherzai was not to be trusted, but he was willing to work with him on a peace jirga to deliver peace to the south.  AWK passionately presented his history of working with the United States since 2001 and told the SCR that he could deliver anything needed.  Missing Wrigley ---------------  10. (SBU//Rel NATO, ISAF) Further emphasizing his links to the United States, AWK fondly recalled his days in Chicago as a restaurant owner close to Chicago's Wrigley Field.  His  KABUL 00000693  003 OF 003   restaurant was a hub for American in the Midwest who had worked or lived in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion, he said.  Comment -------  11. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF)  AWK was eager to engage and rarely stopped talking in the two hour meeting.  While he presented himself as a partner to the United States and is eager to be seen as helping the coalition, he also demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs.  He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police.  We will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a recurring, transparent message to him of where are redlines are and what we expect of him in the months ahead. RICCIARDONE

(S/NF)  Summary:  Interior Minister Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah told Ambassador February 16 that he is deeply concerned about Iranian actions, particularly in Yemen with the Houthis.  A security hard-liner whose views do not always reflect those of the rest of the GoK, Shaykh Jaber suggested Iran is intent upon exporting its revolution and can only be deterred by force from achieving its nuclear ambitions; he characterized Iran as the "beating heart" of Islamic extremism, adding that even Palestinians now aspire to be Shi'a because they have bought Iranian "stories" about Shi'a being more prepared to "fight to the end" and stand up to Israel.  Now Iran is trying to infiltrate Egypt, exploiting poverty there.  Ambassador emphasized USG effort to pursue a "pressure track" with Iran; on Yemen she suggested many of Yemen's problems were home-grown and required economic and social solutions at least as much as military ones.  Shaykh Jaber concurred, calling President Saleh "a leader with an NCO mentality who thinks he can buy loyalty" when what is needed is strong, honest government and firmer security measures.  Ambassador sought GoK assurances on legality and intent to ensure monitoring and withholding of travel documents for any future GTMO returnees, noting that without those firm commitments the cases of the remaining two Kuwaitis in GTMO may prove difficult to resolve.  The Minister promised a more formal response but offered his personal assurances that travel documents would not be issued, and said monitoring of the last two returnees was constant and ongoing.  Ambassador also raised the need for GoK outreach to the Parliament to prioritize passage of pending legislation to criminalize terror financing; Shaykh Jaber said politics was hindering progress on this issue and on many other important bills, including one to criminalize cyber crimes, but said his Ministry was committed to pursuing radical extremists and ensuring the safety of Americans in Kuwait, with or without new laws.  End Summary.  Iran on my mind ----------------  2. (S/NF)  The blunt and outspoken Minister of Interior, Shaykh Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah, told Ambassador and DCM February 16 that Iran is his major concern.  Iran is intent upon exporting its revolution and Shi'ism, has a gameplan, and will only be deterred from achieving its objectives - including a nuclear weapons capability - by force.  The U.S. will not be able to avoid a military conflict with Iran, if it is serious in its intention to prevent Tehran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability.  In Yemen, the Houthis have shown remarkable resilience - where is their power coming from?  Yemeni extremists are making money from the drug trade, moving narcotics into Saudi Arabia.  The GoK has been able to block some of the flow of these drugs from Saudi into Kuwait, but remains very concerned about this. Iran is involved, clearly, as a producer of drugs and a facilitator of transit along the Afghanistan-Iran-Somalia-Yemen pipeline.  Now Iran is trying to expand its influence in Egypt, seeking to exploit poverty there and infiltrate the security services.  Iranian Mythology Resonates ----------------------------  3. (S/NF)  Shaykh Jaber said that the Sunni-Shi'a balance in the region is at risk and chaos could ensue.  Iran is "calling the shots" in Iraq, and has so convinced the region of its stories - that Shi'a and Iran will "fight to the end" where others will not, that only the Shi'a and Iran really stand up to Israel - that now many Palestinians want to convert to Shi'ism.  As a consequence, Iran has become "the beating heart of Islamic extremism."  The Minister apologized for speaking so frankly, but said he wanted to clearly convey what is of greatest concern to the GoK.  4. (S/NF) Note: The Interior Minister's concern about Iran may have been informed by a couple of recent incidents briefed February 17 to the US Navy LNO at the Kuwait Navy Base (see IIR septel for details).  In one incident, on February 6, IRGC Navy speedboats harassed Kuwaiti fishermen; in a more serious incident on February 15 and again on February 16, three IRGC Navy speedboats approached a joint Kuwait/Saudi oil terminal in international waters (located in the Al-Hout field off Mina Az-Zour), approached as close as fifty meters and lingered for forty-five minutes on the first occasion, but only fifteen minutes the second time (perhaps  KUWAIT 00000142  002 OF 003   as a result of the presence of the Kuwaiti patrol boat Istiqlal that was dispatched to the terminal to hold station after the first incident).  End Note.  Pressure Track and Yemen Clarification ---------------------------------------  5. (S/NF)  Ambassador took issue with the Minister's characterization of Iran's role in Iraq and then moved to review U.S. efforts along the "pressure track" with Iran.  In Yemen, Iran may no doubt try to exploit the situation with the Houthis, but the causes of the conflict were largely internal and would require Yemeni President Saleh to pursue a political and social effort as well as a military campaign - as was noted in the recent London conference, many of Yemen's challenges are ones of governance.  Shaykh Jaber agreed, characterizing Saleh as having "an NCO's mentality that you can win everything with money" when what is needed is less corruption and a more proactive security posture.  The Minister noted that Kuwaiti Salafists are sympathetic to the cause of the southern secessionists in Yemen and are being watched by the GoK; he stated, however, that no Kuwaitis are actively involved in the fighting.  Ambassador noted that some in the U.S. intelligence community believe that a considerable number of Kuwaitis are involved with Al-Qaeda, particularly in the AFPAK theater; Shaykh Jaber said Kuwaitis tend more to be sympathizers than practitioners, but said they all were being watched closely.  GTMO Assurances/Clarifications Needed ---------------------------------------  6. (S/NF)  The Ambassador raised the issue of the remaining two Kuwaiti GTMO detainees, and sought the Minister's confirmation that the commitments outlined in the latest draft diplomatic note on oversight of returnees - particularly with reference to constant monitoring and withholding of passports - were both legal and accurately reflected GoK intent.  Clarification of the pending assurances would likely be necessary given the greater seriousness of the cases against the remaining two.  The Minister promised a more formal response later, and made clear that he could not interfere with the activities of the judiciary, but said he was sure the two most recent returnees did not have passports, and characterized their level of monitoring by the security service as "so close they can smell us and feel our breath on the back of their necks."  Need for Passage of AML law ---------------------------  7. (S/NF)  The Ambassador - as she had earlier with the Foreign Minister (reftel) - noted that Kuwait is now the only country on the Arabian Peninsula not to have criminalized terror financing.  A pending law is before parliament, but Speaker Jassem Al-Khorafi had commented privately to the Ambassador that the government had not made its passage a priority for the current legislative session.  Shaykh Jaber responded that politics was getting in the way of much needed legislation, not just TF, but also a bill to define cyber crime.  The Minister offered his assurances that the GoK is very serious on the matter of terror financing and facilitation, with or without the law, and was committed to this and to protecting Americans in Kuwait.  At the close of the meeting, the Ambassador provided Shaykh Jaber with drop copies of two previous requests for information on alleged anti-American plotters in Kuwait, acknowledging that these could be "poison pen" cases, but requesting a formal response from the Ministry to ensure appropriate due diligence had been done.  Comment --------  8. (S/NF)  Shaykh Jaber survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament late last Fall, but the GoK expended only enough effort to ensure his victory by a relatively narrow margin. The reported cost of that governmental support (arranged by a Prime Minister from whom Shaykh Jaber is estranged) was Shaykh Jaber's acceptance that KSS Chief 'Athbi Al-Fahad Al Sabah would report directly to the PM, not to the Interior Minister as has traditionally been the case.  The Interior Minister's tough and candid talk on Iran, consequently, while it offers useful insight into the private worries likely shared by many of Kuwait's seniormost leadership, should not necessarily be seen as an articulation likely to result in any meaningful GoK policy initiatives.

STATE 15979      B. KUWAIT 137  Classified By: Political Counselor Pete O'Donohue for reasons 1.4 b and  d  1. PolCouns on February 23 raised ref a points regarding USG policy on Iran's Tehran research reactor with Counselor Rashid Al-Hajiri, MFA's desk officer for Iran.  Al-Hajiri offered no substantive response to our points, noting merely that the GOK has been following the issue through its representative to the IAEA.  Al-Hajiri added that the GOK shares USG concerns about the lack of transparency in Iran's nuclear program and regularly encourages Iran to comply with international safeguards. At the same time, Al-Hajiri said, the GOK hopes that the international community can persuade Iran to come into compliance through peaceful dialogue rather than through expanded sanctions.  2. Comment: Al-Hajiri's tepid response to our demarche reflects the overall GOK approach to Iran which, as noted Ref B, consists of quietly urging Tehran to abide by IAEA safeguards while maintaining a friendly relationship with its much larger and more powerful neighbor.  Trapped in a difficult neighborhood, the GOK will welcome any proposals that can move Iran off its nuclear path -- including IAEA proposals noted ref A to ensure that Iran receives needed medical isotopes -- but will not expose itself to Iranian ire by getting out front to push for these.  Emblematic of Kuwait's position was the statement by Deputy PM and FM Shaykh Dr. Mohammad Al Sabah February 22, who told the local press that "We wish our friends (in Iran) can do their best to reassure the international community about the Iranian nuclear program so that there will not be an excuse for imposing sanctions.  There are wise people in Iran," he added, continuing to call on Iran to abide by the requirments of international legitimacy and the IAEA.

STATE 9124      B. 09 KUWAIT 1112      C. KUWAIT 61  Classified By: Political Counselor Pete O'Donohue for reasons 1.4 b and  d  1. (C) Ambassador, during a January 31 luncheon in honor of Tony Blair at the residence of Prime Minister Shaykh Nasser Al Sabah, pulled aside Foreign Minister Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al Sabah and raised ref A points concerning Iran's nuclear program, continuing USG concerns, and our efforts to address Tehran's intransigence, which now require greater application of international pressure.  Ambassador also noted Washington interest in Kuwait's recent high-level diplomatic engagement with Iran (PM's visit in November -- ref B), Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Larijani's visit in January (Ref C and septel), and reports of a possible Amiri visit later this Spring, as well as efforts to expand commercial ties, including oil/gas deals on the continental shelf (septel) -- and said that enhanced bilateral cooperation to align our strategies would be welcome.  The FM took the points on board, but declined to be drawn out further on Kuwait's strategy for dealing with Iran.  2. (C) Earlier at the same event, Ambassador raised reftel points with the FM's Office Director, Shaykh Dr. Ahmad Naser Al Sabah (Note: also the Prime Minister's son.  End Note), who asked whether the Iranian side had committed "in writing" to the Tehran reactor fuel swap, the Qom facility inspection and the follow-on meeting of P5 1.  Shaykh Dr. Ahmed suggested that the two critical issues are whether Iran's nuclear program is now so widespread as to be for practical purposes unstoppable -- and whether Tehran has or is close to having the actual wherewithal to construct a nuclear device. Ambassador replied that we are aware of at least three reactors, but said the issue of capability was more difficult to judge -- technical know-how had to be combined with all the various necessary physical components, and there would need to be a political decision to proceed.  She emphasized that the President's hand is still outstretched to Iran, but at some point Iran will have to face the consequences of its recalcitrance; moreover, the President was walking a carefully considered fine line in dealing with others who wished to take actions we hoped to avoid.  3. (C) Dr. Ahmad took Ambassador's point and noted that a year or two ago, many in Kuwait hoped a silent, targeted strike would take out the troublesome reactor and leave the region more relaxed.  He suggested that now, however, Iran might have multiple reactors and was so intent on achieving its nuclear goal that no matter what the West did, Iran would get the bomb, and any attempt to disrupt it militarily or through tough sanctions would go badly for the West.  He offered his analysis that "Iran is very different from Iraq; if the "Murshid" orders his people to do something (like revenge attacks across the Gulf, striking American interests as well as Arab), they will do it, to a person."  4. (C) Polcounselor separately alluded to USG concerns raised reftel during a January 31 meeting with MFA Asia Department Counselor Rashid Al-Hajri during a January read-out on Iranian Speaker Ali Larijani's visit last week to Kuwait (Ref C and septel).  Al-Hajri, in response, delivered the GoK's standard (and not particularly convincing) talking points on this issue, emphasizing the GOK's "clear and unchanging position" that Iran must abide by UN and IAEA safeguards on its nuclear program and opposes any military options in the Gulf.  Al-Hajri said GOK officials invariably stress these points in meetings with Iranian counterparts; at the same time, Kuwait is obliged to conduct bilateral relations on a variety of issues with its larger neighbor.  5. (C) Comment:  Kuwaitis at all levels are deeply worried about the nuclear ambitions of their much larger neighbor, but are unsure how to respond.  They worry that an Iran emboldened by a nuclear arsenal would assert greater regional hegemony at the expense of Kuwaiti interests, and would be more inclined to meddle in Kuwaiti internal affairs given the thirty percent of the nation that is Shi'a.  However, Kuwaitis are equally concerned about military pre-emption, which they believe would not prove decisive and would lead Iran to lash out at US interests in the Gulf (including US military facilities in Kuwait), and against those states in the region seen as allied with the US.  Kuwait's current limited engagement with Iran appears to be motivated by a desire to try to lower regional tensions (particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia), with Kuwait able to distance  itself from the message by emphasizing that it is speaking on behalf of the GCC in its capacity as GCC chair for 2010.  6. (U) Comment continued:  At the same time, Kuwait more parochially is seeking a way forward to secure Iranian agreement to tap gas reserves in the disputed continental shelf (Kuwait needs the gas, which it has little of domestically, to fuel more and cleaner power plants to meet growing electricity demand).  The careful balancing act Kuwait is playing was perhaps best exemplified during the visit last week of Iranian parliamentary Speaker Larijani -- his warning that GCC states should not allow their territory to be used by the US to launch attacks against Iran was carried in most local papers on the front page, above the fold, with prominent coverage given below the fold to comprehensive coverage (including photos) of the US-Kuwait military exercise "Eager Mace."  Kuwait's nuanced approach requires careful footwork, but PM Nasser Mohammed Al Sabah, former dean of Tehran's diplomatic corps and self-described Iran expert, apparently feels confident he is up to the task -- and doesn't need much help from the US with the choreography.

Thursday, 21 January 2010, 12:17C O N F I D E N T I A L LONDON 000131 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/19/2020 TAGS PINR, PTER, PINS, UK, IR SUBJECT: [SOURCE REMOVED] TARGETED BY IRANIAN REGIME Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry, reasons 1.4 (b)  and (d).1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: [DETAIL REMOVED] and prominent VOA commentator Ali Reza Nourizadeh recently told [NAME REMOVED] he had been targeted by Iranian intelligence, an allegation confirmed by London LEGATT. Nourizadeh was approached some months ago by Mohammad Reza Sadeqinia, an Iranian national who introduced himself as a big fan of Nourizadehs. Nourizadeh met Sadeqinia on several occasions in London and Washington, DC, but became suspicious when Sadeqinia took large numbers of photos, including of Nourizadehs vehicle. Sadeqinia was arrested in California on charges of soliciting murder after he attempted to hire a hitman to kill Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd. Because his pattern of behavior towards Nourizadeh was similar to his interactions with Sharmahd, FBI shared the threat information with UK authorities, who subsequently warned Nourizadeh. END SUMMARY.2. (C/NF) Ali Reza Nourizadeh [DETAILS REMOVED] had been visited by British anti-terrorism police who informed him he had been targeted by the Iranian regime. The UK authorities (who,[NAME REMOVED] later learned had received the threat information from the FBI) told Nourizadeh that Reza Sadeqinia, a man who had visited Nourizadeh several times in London and Washington, DC, was working for the Iranian intelligence services and gathering information on Nourizadehs habits. They advised Nourizadeh that Sadeqinia had been arrested in California for soliciting the murder of Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd.3. (C/NF) Nourizadeh, obviously shaken by this news, told [NAME REMOVED] Sadeqinia had contacted him several months before, claiming to be a big fan of Nourizadehs. Nourizadeh became suspicious after Sadeqinia insisted on taking large numbers of photos, including shots of Nourizadehs car and garage. His suspicions were confirmed after he received a message from a well-placed friend who told Nourizadeh he had seen dozens of photos of him on the desk of Iranian Deputy Intelligence Minister Alavi. At that point, Nourizadeh stopped taking Sadeqinias calls and heard nothing more about the matter until he was visited by UK anti-terror police January 14.4. (C/NF) London LEGATT confirmed the arrest of Sadeqinia in the U.S. after he attempted to hire a man to kill Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd of Tondar Radio. Prior to the solicitation of the hitman, videos of Sharmahd had begun to appear on YouTube with commentary that he was acting against Iran and an enemy of the state. Sadeqinia apparently admitted his surveillance of both Sharmahd and Nourizadeh and claimed he was working on behalf of Iranian intelligence. After similar videos of Nourizadeh were discovered, the FBI authorized UK authorities to share the threat information with Nourizadeh. UK authorities are working with Nourizadeh to improve his personal security, and Nourizadeh is cooperating by providing information about his interactions with Sadeqinia.5. (C/NF) COMMENT: Nourizadeh is a well-known figure both inside and outside Iran, and is an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime, so it is unsurprising that the regime would want to keep a close eye on him. If, however, the regime has targeted Nourizadeh for assassination, as it appears to have done with Sharmahd, it marks a clear escalation in the regimes attempts to intimidate critics outside its borders, and could have a chilling effect on journalists, academics and others in the West who until recently felt little physical threat from the regime. Nourizadeh, while clearly taking the threat seriously, will not be cowed -- hes faced this type of threat before (many years ago when he first left Iran), and he has confidence in the British authorities ability to protect him. In fact, he has encouraged other prominent opposition leaders like Shirin Ebadi and Mohsen Makhmalbaf to relocate to London for their own safety.

(C) Summary:  In a two-day visit to Moscow, PM Netanyahu pressed his case on Iran while the GOR was more focused on trade than the MEPP.  The Israeli PM downplayed disagreements over Hamas and welcomed government initiatives to help crisis-depleted economic relations.  Netanyahu came away pleasantly surprised with Moscow's tougher attitude towards Tehran and the GOR's willingness to countenance sanctions, even though disagreement remains on their content.  Israeli contacts are confident Russia will not deliver the S-300s to Iran anytime soon.  End Summary.  ---------------------- A Special Relationship ----------------------  2.  (C) In his first official visit to Russia, PM Netanyahu met with President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin as well as leaders from Russia's Jewish community.  Both sides described this as a productive visit with "frank but positive discussions."  3.  (C) Israeli DCM Roi Rosenblit said Netanyahu's visit emphasized the "special relationship" between Israel and Russia.  He indicated that this the connection between the two countries has flourished in the past year.  Thanks to visa free travel, 400,000 Russian tourists travelled to Israel in 2009.  --------------------------------------------- -- Bilateral Economic and Cultural Ties Increasing --------------------------------------------- --  4.  (C) According to Dmitri Lebedov, Second Secretary in the MFA's Israel and Palestine Department, there was some discussion of economic issues, including cooperation in nanotechnology, agriculture, tourism and banking.  The Russian-Israeli Bilateral Economic and Trade Commission last met in November 2009.  The commission is planning another meeting in 2010 in Jersusalem although a date has not yet been selected.  Lebedev noted that Putin has agreed to visit Israel in 2010.  5.  (C) Rosenblit said both sides blamed the economic crisis for the decrease in bilateral trade in 2009 which affected Israeli imports of both raw diamonds and petrochemicals. Both sides are looking for ways to diversify trade to include more agricultural products.  Rosenblit noted that Russia was very interested in attracting Israeli investment, citing a bilateral agreement on industrial research and development which gives both governments the ability to finance joint start-ups.  6.  (C) Elaborating on economics issues, Rosenblit said that Netanyahu and Putin discussed energy issues.  Rosenblit said that Israel had discussed with Russia and Turkey the possibility of extending to Israel a gas pipeline but this proposal became unnecessary after Israel found offshore gas reserves in Haifa.  Although Gazprom is still interested in building facilities in Haifa and aiding in distribution, Rosenblit said this was now a question for the private sector.   Rosenblit also claimed that an agreement was reached to launch a bilateral agricultural business forum in Moscow, possibly in March 2010.  This would also be a private effort, but under governmental auspices.  He also said that there was some discussion about future outer space cooperation for peaceful purposes.  7.  (C) Rosenblit claimed that the 65th anniversary of World War II and Holocaust remembrance were high on the agenda.  He said that both the GOI and the GOR are unhappy with recent attempts to revise the history of these events.  He noted that a Holocaust Museum will be built in Russia and a commemorative site recognizing the Red Army's role in WWII will be constructed in Israel.  Rosenblit also said that PM Putin invited President Peres to the May 9 Victory Day ceremonies in Moscow later this year.  Medevedev also reportedly green lighted the idea of a cultural program including a "Year of Russia in Israel" and "Year of Israel in Russia" exchange.  ------------------------------------------- Middle East Peace Not High on Either Agenda -------------------------------------------  8.  (C) According to Rosenblit, MEPP was not thoroughly discussed and he "doubted that the Moscow Conference specifically was mentioned."  Rosenblit also downplayed the  MOSCOW 00000392  002 OF 003   recent visits of Abbas and Meshaal and the importance attached to them by the Russians.  He said that he believed Georgia was of greater importance to Russia than Syria, Lebanon or Palestine.  9. (C) Rosenblit said that Netanyahu emphasized his openness to talks between the GOR and the Palestinians because he welcomed any way to bring them back to negotiations.  "We wanted everyone to tell Abbas to return to negotiations because we can't give him a deal until he sits down."  He noted that Israel prefers direct contacts but supports any kind of negotiations.  Rosenblit said that Israel still insists on talks without preconditions and no interim agreements: "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed." Rosenblit said that Israel supported Russia's efforts to achieve comprehensive negotiations including Syria and Lebanon.  10.  (C) Referring to the recent visit to Moscow of Khaled Meshaal, Netanyahu told his interlocutors that Hamas should not be legitimized by other countries.  Although Meshaal had only a 15 minute meeting with Lavrov, it received significant coverage in the media.  Rosenblit said Medvedev asked what Russia could do to help with Hamas.  Netanyahu repeated that Israel does not see Hamas as a legitimate partner but would use the Russia-Hamas channel to discuss humanitarian issues such as the proposed prisoner swap for IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.  ------------------------ Closer than Ever on Iran ------------------------  11. (C) Lebedov sought to downplay discussions of Iran saying that, while it was discussed, other bilateral issues took up most of the discussions.  12. (C) Rosenblit, however, claimed that Iran was clearly at the top of Israel's agenda for this visit.  He said Netanyahu was "keen to form a group of like-minded parties" who recognized the danger of Iran's program and would cooperate to stop its "militant nuclearlization."  Netanyahu emphasized that Israel believes that once Iran has nuclear capabilities, other regional powers will immediately seek their own nuclear weapons.  Because of this danger, and the threat from Tehran itself, Netanyahu urged Russia to cooperate on tougher sanctions against Iran.  13. (C) The Israeli side, according to Rosenblit, was pleasantly surprised at Russia's harsh tone on Iran which had changed dramatically even since FM Lieberman's visit in November.  "We heard words from them that we've never heard before," Rosenblit claimed, "and we aren't hearing the same old arguments."  Rosenblit credited this change to the Iranians themselves, saying that their rejection of the TRR proposal and their decision to enrich to 20 percent had toughened Russia's stance on Iran.  He remarked that just a few months ago, there was concern in Israel that Iran would divide the international community, but Iran's actions have only served as a unifying factor. "Russia's understanding of the Iranian nuclear issue is closer to ours than it was a few months ago."  -------------------------- Ready to Discuss Sanctions --------------------------  14.  (C) On the issue of sanctions, Netanyahu reportedly handed the GOR a list of areas where Israel felt sanctions could affect change in Iran's behavior.  The list included restrictions on Iranian exports of energy products; Iranian imports of refined petroleum products; the financial and banking sectors; and, shipping and aerospace companies.  He noted that, while Russia was ready to discuss sanctions, the two did not necessarily see eye to eye on the specifics. Both sides did agree, however, that the UNSC had to agree on sanctions.  Rosenblit said that Russian officials do not believe that unilateral sanctions will have the desired effect.  They believe that the international community has to maintain united and either agree to impose or not impose sanctions.  15.  (C) Netanyahu encouraged Russia to be an example for China regarding sanctions.  Rosenblit said both Israel and Russia had been working bilaterally with China to convince them that it was time for a serious discussion on sanctions. --------------------------------------------- -- S-300s: No Quid Pro Quo, but We Trust Medevedev --------------------------------------------- --   MOSCOW 00000392  003 OF 003   16.  (C) When asked about media reports citing Netanyahu himself which suggested that Israel had agreed not to restart arms deals with Georgia in exchange for Russia's continued inaction on the S-300s contract with Iran, Lebedov noted that, in spite of this statement, there had been no change in the GOR's policy.  He claimed that fulfillment of the S-300s contract remained a political decision.  He remarked that the S-300 system was itself defensive in nature and could not be used against another party, such as Israel.  17.  (C) Rosenblit also would not acknowledge that a deal had been made.  Instead, he said that Netanyahu had reiterated his trust in Medvedev regarding the S-300s.  According to Rosenblit, Netanyahu believes that Russia has taken "all aspects of regional stability" into account when taking decisions on the S-300s.  Rosenblit did note that the S-300s issue offered a window onto the different vectors in Russian foreign policy, with the contradictory statements that their delivery was imminent, and the delay being caused by technical and political issues, coming just days before Netanyahu's visit.  18.  (C) Rosenblit said that neither Russia nor Israel was linking the S-300 issue with arms sales to Georgia.  Israel, he claimed, as a Russian partner, was "listening attentively" to Russia's concerns about weapons supplies to Georgia and the effects this could have in the region.  Israel has friendly relations with Georgia but the Russian relationship was also very important, he said.  He indicated that both sides were trying to come to an "understanding."  19.  (C) Comment: The Russian media built up the Prime Minster's visit as the final stage of Russia's Abbas-Meshaal-Netanyahu trifecta of Middle East callers. While both sides paid lip-service to MEPP issues, Iran was the main agenda item.  This reflects Netanyahu's priorities and the GOR's belief that it is Washington's job, not Moscow's, to pressure the Israelis on MEPP issues.  Israel came away pleased with Russia's changed posture on Iran, but disappointed that its list of sanctions was too ambitious for the GOR.  Separately, the widely reported "quid-pro-quo" on a mutual freeze of the Russian S-300 delivery for Iran and Israeli military sales to Georgia could be a convenient Israeli invention.  While Israeli contacts say there is no formal deal, Netanyahu's statements to the media created enough speculation to put Russia in a corner.  Should Moscow eventually deliver the system to Iran, Israel has a pretext to step up arms sales to Georgia. Beyrle
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MUNICH 000029  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2020 TAGS: PREL PGOV INRB GMSUBJECT: GERMANY/BAVARIA: HORST SEEHOFER, MOSTLY FOCUSED ON DOMESTIC POLITICS  Classified By: Consul General Conrad Tribble for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d )  SUMMARY -------  1.  (C)  Horst Seehofer, an unpredictable politician struggling to regain his party's hegemony in Bavaria, revealed only shallow foreign policy expertise when he met Ambassador Murphy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on February 6.  Seehofer, Minister President and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), did not contradict the Ambassador when he reviewed the new NATO Afghanistan policy, which implied Seehofer was now on board with the German governing coalition in this respect.  Closer to home, he expected the trend away from the major political parties to continue in Germany, creating opportunities for numerous smaller parties to enter German statehouses. Observers of Seehofer and his leadership of the CSU may wish to take his public pronouncements with a grain of salt, especially when he contradicts or criticize American foreign policy goals as he did recently on Afghanistan.  End Summary.  2.  (SBU)  Ambassador Murphy met with Bavarian Minister President and CSU Party Chairman Horst Seehofer on the margins of the Munich Security Conference on February 6. Referring to his recent visit to Afghanistan, the Ambassador told Seehofer how impressed he was with the German operation in the North, stressing the importance of the new Afghanistan strategy.  He praised the nomination of Volker Wieker to new Inspector General of the German Army, since Wieker had been General McChrystal's right hand and really knew what was going on.  The Ambassador further emphasized the point that 2,500 U.S. soldiers would be sent to the North, but that Germans would be in control.  Maximum effort was necessary," he said, noting "if we don't try, we fail."  Turning to Iran, Seehofer asked about the Ambassador's assessment of Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki's appearance in Munich, and Murphy answered that Mottaki's were rather vain and counter-productive efforts that could not be taken seriously.   3.  (C)  In general, Seehofer had little to say regarding foreign policy and seemed uninformed about basic things.  For example, he expressed surprise when State Chancery Minister Siegfried Schneider, also present, emphasized that 20,000 out of the 40,000 U.S. soldiers in Germany were stationed in Bavaria.  The Ambassador emphasized the excellent Bavarian-American relations, stressing his visits to the Bavarian Representation in Berlin and the many business contacts.  Seehofer pointed to the economic/financial crisis and was not sure whether the EU would bail out Greece.  He called for better regulation of financial markets, adding that the CDU/CSU's coalition partner, the FDP, was still dreaming about "total liberty," yet the citizens were more realistic.  The Bavarian economy remained strong, he said, but despite relative low unemployment overall, Bavaria struggled with serious regional economic differences around the state.  "You no longer buy our cars," he joked.  The main problem for the Bavarian budget was the unresolved situation of BayernLB, he admitted.  Federal Health Minister from 1992 to 1998, Seehofer expressed interest in the chances of success of the U.S. health reform, expressing his concern about 47 million Americans who had no health insurance.  4.  (C)  The Ambassador and Seehofer agreed that the political landscape in Germany had changed radically over the past few years.  Seehofer did not dare predict an outcome of the May election in North Rhine Westphalia.  Everything was possible, he said.  German citizens no longer shrank from voting for the Left Party and in the long run, the SPD and Left Party would likely come together again.  Five to six parties now had a realistic chance of entering state parliaments, even in Bavaria.  COMMENT -------  5.  (C) As chairman of one of the three parties that make up the governing coalition in Berlin, Seehofer frequently and quite publicly addresses sensitive political issues, including foreign policy.  Back in December, he gave an interview flatly rejecting an increase of German soldiers in Afghanistan, which startled many political observers, including CSU insiders.  We note that Seehofer has never professed to be a foreign policy expert.  His strengths are rather more in domestic politics.  The drop of public support for the CSU in recent elections has further encouraged Seehofer's natural instincts to utter populist pronouncements  MUNICH 00000029  002 OF 002   rather than substantive statements.

C O N F I D E N T I A L MUSCAT 000071  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2020/02/02 TAGS: PREL MARR MOPS IR MUSUBJECT: OMANI GOVERNMENT REACTS STRONGLY TO SUGGESTION OF PATRIOT OFFER  CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Schmierer, Ambassador, Department of State, Embassy Muscat; REASON: 1.4(A), (B), (D)  1. (C) Summary:  A recent New York Time's (NYT) article describing Patriot missile deployment to countries in the Gulf in order to counter Iran, assuage Israel, and reassure our Gulf partners has been disquieting to the Omani Government.  There has never been an official USG offer of Patriots to Oman, due in large part to the GoO's rejection of any undertaking that might include or would imply the presence of Patriot missiles here.  Oman's close partnership with the USG, particularly through the Base Access Agreement (BAA), is contingent on maintaining an extremely low profile and continuing the Sultanate's foreign policy objective of carefully balancing public perception of its relationships with the U.S. and Iran.  Press of this sort, however unintended, makes it extremely difficult for Oman to maintain that balance.  End Summary.    Press Articles on Missile Defense in the Gulf  --------------------------------------------- ----------  2. (U) A NYT article appeared on January 30 titled "U.S. Speeding Up Missile Defenses in Persian Gulf," which quoted General Petraeus as saying that Patriot missile batteries would be located in four gulf countries, and noted that Saudi Arabia already has Patriots. An unnamed military official named the countries as Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait.   The version of this article syndicated by the NYT news service includes the sentence "Oman, which has always been sensitive about perceptions that it is doing U.S. bidding, has also been approached, but there is no deployment of Patriots there, according to U.S. officials."  (Note:  That sentence does not/not appear in the version currently available via the NYT website, and it is unclear to post if it appeared in the print edition on January 31; the syndicated version of the article is otherwise not substantially different from the NYT original.  End Note).   The item was picked up by regional press on January 31, quoting the NYT article and specifically noting that "Oman has declined the offer." On February 2, the private English daily "Times of Oman" carried a front page article titled "Missile Shield: Oman denies receiving any offer from US."  In it, Sayyid Badr al Busaidi, Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), is quoted as saying, "the Sultanate's position on such matters is firm and that it does not ... enter into alliances or axis (sic) against any state."  He stressed that Oman "does not allow its territory to be used to carry out any military operations against any country in the region."    Oman is not Interested  ------------------------------  3. (C) The Embassy has no record of a formal offer of Patriot missiles made to Oman by the USG.  However, a number of discussions have occurred in which USG intent was to gauge Omani interest in collective missile defense capability.  Oman has consistently shown a lack of interest and has politely declined to engage in substantive discussions on "shared early warning" systems, "integrated air defense,"  or "collective defense."  (Note:  This is likely due to its assessment that Iran does not pose an imminent threat, its desire to not needlessly antagonize Iran, and its distrust of fellow GCC members, making it unwilling to share data within that group.  End Note.)  Further, in official correspondence, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) rejected an offer for a "Missile and Air Defence Working Group" on February 6, 2009; rejected further offers for an "Air and Missile Defense Shared Early Warning (SEW) System" on March 30, 2009, citing Oman's "unwillingness to commit itself to a SEW"; and on July 22, 2009 again rejected any participation in the "Air Defense Missiles Advanced Warning System" project.    Direct Omani Reaction  -----------------------------  4. (C) The Omani Royal Office made contact with the Embassy on February 2 to express strong concern about the article and its repercussions, as that office had just received a pointed inquiry from the Sultan on this matter.  In a follow-up discussion embassy officer provided the history of discussions on the issue, of which the Royal Office was previously unaware, due to what was described   as a "lack of lateral coordination within the GoO."    5. (C) Comment:  The strength of Oman's immediate reaction, and the level at which it transpired, is reflective of the tremendous seriousness with which this matter is viewed by the GoO.  It is likely that one of the goals of Badr's media statement was to protect the U.S./Omani relationship, as any belief that the U.S. would attempt to utilize Omani territory in this way could potentially cause a public backlash that would jeopardize other aspects of our relationship.  The deployment of Patriots to Oman, especially with the goal of countering the Iran threat, would run completely counter to Oman's publicly-stated foreign-policy objectives.  Although they do not find the threat imminent, Iran is Oman's number one strategic threat; however, the GoO fundamentally believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of the relationship.  Therefore, the GoO works very deliberately to create a  public perception of balance in its relationships with the U.S. and Iran.  Oman's security strategy of keeping a low public profile in general has been threatened by the attention brought by the NYT article, and the GoO is working to manage the message for the public.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 PARIS 000170  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12598  DECL: 02/12/20 TAGS: PREL MOPS MAR FR IR AF NATOSUBJECT:  SECDEF GATES'S MEETING WITH FRENCH MINISTER OF DEFENSE HERVE MORIN, FEBRUARY 8, 2010.  PARIS 00000170  001.2 OF 004   Classified By: Alexander Vershbow, ASD/ISA. Reasons 1.4 (b/d).  Ref: USNATO 56  1. (S/NF) SUMMARY:  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) was hosted by French Minister of Defense Herve Morin for a working lunch during an official bilateral visit to Paris on February 8, 2010. SecDef and Morin agreed on the basic themes to be included in NATO's revised Strategic Concept.  On Missile Defense, SecDef refuted Morin's contention that a European Missile Defense system is both unwise and unnecessary but pledged to give France and other Allies better information on the costs and command and control structure of the U.S. proposal.  Both Morin and Gates agreed that Iran's rejection of an engagement track meant that the time for pressure had arrived, but both noted concern over China's opposition to a new UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR).  On Afghanistan, SecDef praised French contributions and highlighted ongoing trainer shortfalls.  SecDef raised U.S. concerns over the sale of a Mistral-class helicopter carrier to Russia as sending a mixed signal to both Russia and our Central and East European Allies.  Morin refuted this idea, arguing that the sale was a way to send a message of partnership to Russia at a critical time.  Morin requested that the upcoming U.S. Air Force Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new in-flight refueling tanker aircraft be unbiased.  SecDef told Morin that he had full confidence that the RFP would be as fair as possible.   END SUMMARY.  ---------------------- NATO Strategic Concept ----------------------  2. (S/NF) Morin welcomed SecDef to France and asked about U.S positions regarding the revised NATO Strategic Concept.  Morin noted France's interest in a document that would inject new ideas, be adopted with great momentum, and define NATO's roles and missions. It should not just be a restatement of the conventional wisdom.  3. (S/NF) SecDef told Morin he favored a short document that was perhaps three to five pages in length.  The Strategic Concept should move NATO from a traditional defensive alliance to a security alliance that can address a wide range of global threats.  SecDef said that the Strategic Concept must better align resources with NATO's level of ambition; it must lay out a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation and enhance partnerships with the EU, UN and other international organizations.  SecDef concluded that, above all, financial and broader structural reform must be pursued -- either as part of the Strategic Concept or in parallel.  4. (S/NF) Morin agreed on length and the need for NATO to take on new missions, but he wondered what types of missions members had in mind. Cyber attacks?  Terrorism?  Proliferation?  Missile Defense?  Morin also stated his belief that NATO needed to bring some clarity to its area of operation so that NATO did not end up extending to the Pacific.  He added that, in his view, extending the Alliance to Georgia would weaken Article 5.  SecDef stated his preference for NATO to focus its efforts in the Euro-Atlantic area, perhaps extending into the Mediterranean.  He concurred with Morin that a bigger Alliance posed challenges.  5. (S//NF) Morin told SecDef that the UK MoD had proposed drafting a joint French-UK proposal on NATO reform to then present to the U.S. Noting that the objective was to overcome blockages from those countries that had underwhelming General Staffs, Morin asked whether SecDef thought it would be better for Europe to build consensus at home and work its own ideas, or for Europe and the United States to develop joint proposals.  SecDef replied that he thought it best not to have two proposals, but that he would consult with SecState.  He also said he hoped that the Senior Officials Group would come up with some concrete and viable ideas for reform.  --------------- Missile Defense ---------------  6. (S/NF) Morin, having expressed strong reservations to new U.S. and NATO missile defense (MD) plans at the NATO ministerial in Istanbul (reftel), said he wanted to explain how France sees MD and raise some questions.  First, he believes that the shift from Theater Missile Defense (TMD) to defense of populations and territory will give publics a false sense of security, since the sword was ultimately stronger than the shield.  For France, security came from strong defense and deterrence.  Second, Morin asked what threat the system aims to counter.  Nuclear states or rogue states?  Third, Morin asked about funding and how European countries would participate in command and control (C2) decisions.  Morin summarized his own personal opposition to MD by asserting that the U.S. and Europe have differing mentalities on defense spending.  He said the U.S. has true resiliency with  PARIS 00000170  002.2 OF 004   "infinite" means, while in Europe defense spending has collapsed in every country but the UK and France.  As a result, any development needing common funding will dilute the already weak European defenses. Morin concluded by stating that it was folly to assume that MD would give us added security.  7. (S/NF) SecDef refuted Morin's arguments, pointing out that MD contributes to deterrence.  SecDef explained to Morin that the system was aimed at nations with a handful of nuclear weapons and a limited but growing missile capability to launch them.  Noting Iran fits that profile, SecDef said that MD provides a good deterrent against limited attacks.  8. (S/NF) SecDef agreed with MoD Morin that the U.S. owed NATO answers on C2, costs, and the role of common funding.  He pledged to provide more details on these issues, as well as on how ALTBMD and the U.S. Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) fit together.  However, SecDef said it was important to move ahead with the MD study that was endorsed at the 2009 NATO summit, since it would provide some of the answers France was seeking.  SecDef reminded Morin that POTUS will want to obtain a decision affirming the Alliance role in MD at the Lisbon summit in late 2010.  9. (S/NF) Responding to SecDef's discussion of MD, Morin asked why there was a need to shift from theater to population defense.  SecDef said the systems the U.S. was deploying have broader applications.  For example the THAAD system, which the U.S. had deployed to Hawaii as a measure against North Korean threat, protects both the theater and the population.  Gates offered the Aegis ship-borne SM-3, which was used to shoot down a defunct satellite, as a second example of a system that could also have broader applications and deter Iran from holding us hostage by threatening missile launches.  10. (S/NF) Recalling that Russian Prime Minister Putin once told him Iran was Russia's greatest threat, SecDef noted that Russia could plug into the new system.  SecDef highlighted two Russian objections to the former system:  first, the radar in the Czech Republic would have been so powerful that it could see into Russia; second, Russia believed that the three-stage Ground-Based Interceptor could have been converted easily to an offensive weapon.  The SM-3 missiles in the new approach can only be defensive in nature, however.  For these reasons, the U.S. believed partnering with Russia is once again potentially possible. (NOTE:  Following the meetings, Morin's critical comments on Missile Defense were disavowed by senior officials at the MoD and the MFA, who said that his views were his own and that the U.S. should essentially "erase" what he had just said.  END NOTE.)  ----- Iran -----  11. (S/NF) Shifting from Missile Defense to Iran, SecDef noted that Russia is now of a different mind on Iran because of Tehran's persistent rejection of international proposals for negotiated solutions and its concealment of the Qom facility.  SecDef believed Russia would be supportive of a new UNSCR, although it may have different views on the severity of sanctions, but he expressed concern about China.  SecDef said that Russia could perhaps help on China, but that securing the support of other non-permanent Security Council members was also an issue.  In this regard, SecDef told Morin he had been blunt with Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan, telling him that if Iran developed nuclear weapons, we were facing two scenarios:  nuclear proliferation in the Middle East or a regional war (or perhaps both).  12. (S/NF) Morin asked SecDef if he believed Israel had the capability to strike Iran without U.S. support.  SecDef responded that he didn't know if they would be successful, but that Israel could carry out the operation.  SecDef told Morin that he believed a conventional strike by any nation would only delay Iranian plans by one to three years, while unifying the Iranian people to be forever embittered against the attacker.  13. (S/NF) MoD Morin agreed that China could be problematic on the UNSCR and queried SecDef how the U.S. believed we could ensure their vote, especially in light of the upcoming Dalai Lama visit and the U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan.  SecDef told Morin that because of Congressionally mandated rules, the U.S. was required to provide defensive weapons for Taiwan.  He observed that every time the U.S. makes the sales to Taiwan, the Chinese suspend military-to-military relations, but only for the short term.  -------- Pakistan --------  14. (S/NF) Morin expressed doubt about the willingness of the Pakistani  PARIS 00000170  003 OF 004   government to fight extremists at home.  He noted that Karzai had told the French that if the Pakistan-Afghanistan border were closed, it would largely solve issues in Afghanistan.  SecDef replied that he had told the Pakistani government two weeks earlier that Al Qaeda was helping the Pakistan Taliban to destabilize Pakistan.  SecDef highlighted the dramatic changes in Pakistan over the past 18 months, especially in Swat and Bajaur provinces, which offered some hope of progress.  SecDef said that there was increasing coordination between U.S. and Pakistani forces across the border.  ----------- Afghanistan -----------  15. (S/NF) Turning to Afghanistan, MoD Morin began by stating that although he had announced an additional 80 trainers, France had also sent a non-official contribution as well.  (NOTE:  Morin was referring to a classified deployment of French Special Forces that have a limited mission to find two kidnapped French journalists. END NOTE.)  France had also sent an additional deployment of engineers to work exclusively on the Counter-IED mission.  Morin underscored that France had significantly increased its contributions in Afghanistan in the past 18 months from 2700 troops to nearly 4000.  16. (S/NF) SecDef said the U.S. understood the domestic situation and that he would not have pressed France publicly for more forces until after the March elections.  However SecDef requested that France strongly consider substantially increasing military and police trainers.  SecDef said that while he would publicly praise French troops, which U.S. troops consider terrific fighters, he was fine with keeping these discussions close hold.  17. (S/NF) Shifting topics, Morin questioned the decision to specifically name mid-2011 as the start of a withdrawal, which Morin thought would simply make the Taliban wait it out.  SecDef noted that whether to set a date for transition had led to one of the most protracted debates in Washington in recent months.  SecDef had come to the conclusion, however, that the Afghans needed to be put on notice that they would need to take responsibility for their own security.  He pointed out that there is no end date for U.S. involvement; July 2011 is just the beginning of a process.  POTUS was very clear that the transition would be conditions-based.  Morin agreed with this and urged that clear benchmarks be set that could reassure public opinion. SecDef concurred and observed that the U.S. public will not tolerate a prolonged stalemate.  -------------- Russia/Mistral --------------  18. (S/NF) SecDef expressed U.S. concerns about the Mistral sale to Russia.  He told Morin that because of Sarkozy's involvement in brokering a ceasefire in Georgia, which Russia was not fully honoring, the sale would send the wrong message to Russia and to our Allies in Central and East Europe.  19. (S/NF) Morin told SecDef pointedly that he had pushed hard for the sale.  He conceded that it was indeed a warship for power projection. But Morin asked rhetorically how we can tell Russia we desire partnership but then not trust them.  Morin told SecDef that he understood the U.S. position on considering Central and East European Allies' concerns about the perceived threat from Russia.  Morin argued, however, that this single ship would not make any difference with respect to Russian capabilities, as Russia's naval production ability was severely degraded.  20. (S/NF) SecDef replied that U.S. concerns were not about military capacity but about messaging.  Some allies, because of their past experiences, are still very concerned with Russia and are not sure how much to trust the West.  SecDef observed that Russian democracy has disappeared and the government was an oligarchy run by the security services.  President Medvedev has a more pragmatic vision for Russia than PM Putin, but there has been little real change.  -------------- KC-X Tanker RFP --------------  21. (S/NF) Morin told SecDef he had one final, but major, topic to raise, the U.S. contract tender for a new tanker plane.  He asked that the RFP be issued so that competition was equal for both companies and there was no bias.  Morin stressed that it was important for our market economy to be a two-way street.  He told SecDef that if the terms of competition are unequal, EADS would not submit a bid.  22. (S/NF) SecDef stated his belief that the RFP would be fair.  He  PARIS 00000170  004 OF 004   told Morin that the Air Force had established the requirements.  He noted that since the previous competition, he had fired both the civilian and military leaders of the Air Force and that there was a new person in charge of the Pentagon's acquisition policy.  SecDef said that it would be disappointing if EADS did not submit a proposal.  23. (U) SecDef has cleared this cable.  Drafted by OSD Staff.   RIVKIN
C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 000118  SIPDIS  LONDON PASS TO SECRETARY'S PARTY NEA FOR ARP  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2020 TAGS: PREL MNUC PTER PGOV KGHG SENV ETRD SA IRSUBJECT: SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTRY PRESSING CHINA TO STOP IRANIAN PROLIFERATION, CONCERNED ABOUT TSA REGULATIONS  Classified By: Ambassador James B. Smith, reasons 1.4 (b and d).  1. (C) Summary: Saudi Foreign Ministry officials told visiting NEA A/S Feltman that they are convinced Iran intends to develop a nuclear weapon, and that the Saudi Foreign Minister pressed his counterpart hard for greater Chinese engagement on this threat during the Chinese FM's visit earlier in January.  While no explicit deal was discussed, Saudi Arabia made it clear it was willing to address Chinese concerns on energy security and trade in exchange for effective Chinese support to prevent Iranian proliferation. Saudi Arabia is also concerned about Iran's unhelpful role in Yemen.  While generally very pleased with the state of bilateral relations, Saudi officials strenuously - and under instruction - complained about the continued negative effect of the recent Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) regulations that call for extra security screening for Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi Foreign Minister will raise these concerns with the Secretary in London on January 27.  They noted that the Saudi public is increasingly upset by this, and does not understand why they were put in the same group with Cuba, which has prompted some Saudis to question how special their relationship with the United States really is.  A/S Feltman urged Saudi Arabia to associate itself with the Copenhagen Accord by January 31.  The MFA reported that Saudi Arabia donated $50 million for Haitian relief efforts on January 25.  End Summary.  Iranian Nuclear Ambitions: - - - - - - - - - - - - -  2. (C) Visiting NEA A/S Feltman discussed a wide range of issues with Deputy Saudi Foreign Minister Dr. Prince Torki Al-Saud Al-Kabir on January 26.  Prince Torki said Saudi Arabia is convinced that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons, and reported that Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal pressed the Chinese Foreign Minister on this issue on his January 17 visit.  Saud Al-Faisal told the Chinese that, for Saudi Arabia, this is a critical security issue. Iran,s getting nuclear weapons will open the door to the rest of the Middle East pursuing nuclear weapons.  Saudi Arabia would prefer that the Middle East remain a nuclear free zone.  When the Chinese Foreign Minister replied that China will not accept Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Saud Al-Faisal told him that China will have to work more closely with the rest of the world and the UN Security Council to prevent this from happening.  3. (C) Prince Torki agreed that it was not helpful that the Chinese sent a low-level delegation to the most recent 5 1 talks.  He also agreed it was unfortunate the delegation did not agree it was time now to increase pressure on Iran. Al-Kabir also noted that time was not in the UN Security Council's favor, but in Iran's.  Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia was convinced the time was ripe to push China on this issue.  It would be important to demonstrate that the assurances FM Al-Faisal got were not just from the Foreign Minister, but represented the thinking of the whole government.  He said that Saudi Arabia repeated these points to the Chinese Middle East special envoy, who visited a week later.  Saudi Arabia has also raised these concerns with Russia, "which is closer to the U.S. and Saudi positions," and with the Deputy French Foreign Minister three weeks ago. Prince Torki also agreed to work with Lebanon's UN Mission, now on the Security Council, where it is sure to confront the issue of Iranian proliferation.  4. (C) Prince Torki said that China never directly raised the issue of its concerns about securing sufficient oil supplies, particularly in the event of a cutoff of Iranian supplies. However, Saudi Arabia fully understands China's concerns, and in that context, is pleased that the Chinese Foreign Minister had  talks with Saudi Aramco and trade officials about specific commercial and energy issues. Prince Torki noted that Saudi Arabia has become one of China's largest energy suppliers, and has invested billions of dollars in refineries in China.  Trade has grown from $140 million a decade ago to $75 billion now, with prospects for further increases.  Prince Torki concluded by noting that Saudi Arabia knows what concerns China, and is willing to take actions to address those concerns, but must have Chinese cooperation in stopping Iran,s development of nuclear weapons as a quid pro quo.  Saudi Arabia is encouraging other  Gulf countries to meet with China to explore similar cooperation, although it expects these countries will seek the same exchange.  Yemen: - - - -  5. (C) Prince Torki explained that Saudi Arabia also believes that Iran is playing an unhelpful role in Yemen.  Dismissing the need for specific evidence, he said it was hard to explain how the Houthis, as a poor tribal group, managed to get so much money so quickly to obtain the heavy armaments that they have been using absent the help of some outside group.  It is also hard, he argued, to explain the striking similarities with techniques that have been used by pro-Iranian groups in Iraq.  Saudi Arabia is convinced that Iran is providing money for poor tribesmen to fight, as well as payments to their families, and is facilitating contact with Somalia and Al Qaeda.  Prince Torki said the Saudi Defense Forces have been impressed how well the Houthis have fought, displaying advanced training.  (Note: in a separate meeting, Ministry of Interior officials echoed many of these assessments in greater detail, septel.  End Note).  6. (C) Prince Torki was unequivocal in stating that Saudi Arabia has no intention of becoming part of the current conflict between the central government and the Houthis. Saudi Arabia felt it had to respond, however, after Houthi forces crossed its border.  He said that it made little sense for the Houthis to have attacked Saudi Arabia, especially since the SAG had warned them previously not to.  He concluded that Iran was trying to test Saudi reactions. Yemen does not need U.S. troops, but does need equipment, training and information, as well as assistance to meet its long-term development challenges.  He also said that Saudi Arabia is very concerned about Al Qaeda's continued presence in Yemen, as it will exploit any opportunity to attack Saudi Arabia and the United States.  Bilateral Relations: - - - - - - - - - - -  7. (C). Prince Torki agreed that our bilateral relations are quite strong in general.  He singled out counter-terrorism as an example of the strength of cooperation, noting that Saudi Arabia enjoys a unique level of cooperation on security with the United States.  Prince Torki confirmed that Saudi Arabia had contributed $50 million to the Haiti relief effort on January 25, which is the largest contribution to date of any Middle Eastern country.  He also welcomed greater U.S. engagement in multilateral and international organizations.  Climate Change: - - - - - - - -  8.(SBU) A/S Feltman noted the importance that the President places on Climate Change, and the Copenhagen Accord.  Given that Minister of Petroleum Al-Naimi was involved in crafting the final agreement, A/S Feltman noted the United States is counting on Saudi Arabia to associate itself with the accord by January 31.  Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia was very pleased the United States was more actively engaged in this issue, and said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs supports trying to address this issue.  He noted that the MFA will have to consult with other involved ministries, such as the Ministry of Petroleum, and promised to respond before January 31.  Concern over TSA Regulations: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  9. (SBU) Prince Torki noted he had been instructed to raise Saudi Arabia's significant concern about the TSA regulations which had included Saudi Arabia in a limited group of countries for additional airport screening.  Prince Torki said that this issue had caused a lot of difficulties and embarrassment for Saudi Arabia, to the degree that Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal will raise this with the Secretary in London on January 27.  Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia was not upset about the regulation itself, as it recognized the U.S. right and obligation to protect its citizens.  The issue, rather, was inclusion on the list with the likes of Cuba, which causes Saudi Arabia's friends and enemies to  question how strong its bilateral relationship with the United States really is.  Prince Torki said it is very hard to explain to the Saudi public why they are included on this list, despite not being the origin of the December 25 flight, while other countries that have had recent terrorist incidents on planes, like the UK, Egypt and Turkey, are not. Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia had been shocked to be included on the list.  He noted that Saudi Arabia had been told these provisions would only be temporary, and said Saudi Arabia would like to know how and when they will be amended, implying that the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the USG, the more it was likely to prompt the Saudi Government to re-evaluate areas of cooperation, including counter-terrorism cooperation.  A/S Feltman promised to convey the spirit and strength of the message, and invited any specific Saudi suggestions to address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives exploited in the December 25 incident.  Middle East Peace: - - - - - - - - -  10. (C) In response to a question, A/S Feltman explained that the United States believes that we need to get the Israelis and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, which will be the best way to compel Israel to follow through on its public statements and to overcome Palestinian skepticism.  A/S Feltman noted that the United States had referred to the 1967 lines with swaps as a way of helping encourage the Palestinians to return to the table.  Prince Torki welcomed this overview.  (U) This cable has been cleared by A/S Feltman.  SMITH

BEIJING 69      B. 09 RIYADH 895      C. RIYADH 118  RIYADH 00000123  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Ambassador James B. Smith for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)   SUMMARY: ----------  1. (C) Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met with King Abdullah and FM Prince Saud Al-Faisal on January 13, during the last stop of a five nation Africa and Middle East tour. During the visit, FM Yang discussed deepening Saudi-Chinese ties in a variety of fields, emphasizing trade, in particular, with his Saudi counterparts.  Responding to statements made by FM Saud, Yang also briefly discussed Chinese support for Iraq, concern about Iranian nuclear ambitions, and hopes for the Middle East Peace Process.  FM Yang's foray into regional political commentary appears to have been a result of FM Saud's prodding, both publicly and behind closed doors, and is a reflection of the developing Saudi-Chinese relationship. END SUMMARY.   TRADE TAKES PRECEDENCE ----------------------  2. (U)  FM Yang arrived in Riyadh on January 13, the first high-level visit since Chinese President Hu Jintao's February 2009 "Trip of Friendship and Cooperation."  FM Yang's visit coincided with the 20th anniversary of Saudi-Chinese diplomatic relations, and followed three days after Chinese Trade Minister Chen Deming co-chaired the 4th session of the Saudi-Chinese Joint Commission in Riyadh.  3. (U) The Chinese Foreign Minister has traditionally made his first overseas trip of the new year to Africa, visiting with African leaders and expressing Chinese goodwill and improvements in trade relations.  This year, FM Yang extended his visit to include not only major trading partners like Nigeria, Kenya and Morocco, but also Saudi Arabia.  In a January 13 statement to the press, FM Yang stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation in "energy, infrastructure, finance and science and technology."  He said that both sides should carry out cultural and education exchanges to deepen the bilateral relationship and pressed the need for closer relations between China and the GCC.  4. (U) These statements echoed similar announcements from Chinese Trade Minister Chen who, in a January 10 press conference, called for finalizing the Chinese-GCC free trade agreement and increasing bilateral trade by 50%, from a total annual value of $40 billion to $60 billion, over the next five years (ref A).  During the Joint Commission meeting, Saudi Minister of Finance Ibrahim Al-Assaf reportedly urged the Chinese to participate in more joint ventures, noting that while bilateral trade increased 25 times over the past ten years, the two countries only have 19 joint projects. Al-Assaf also welcomed China's 44 billion riyal ($11.7 billion) worth of infrastructure projects in the Kingdom.   DUMPING CAUSES A BUMP ---------------------  5. (C) This call to increase Sino-Saudi trade comes on the heels of a December 24 announcement that China would impose anti-dumping tariffs of up to 13.6 percent on Saudi and Taiwan-produced butanediol.  Beijing began a dumping probe on methanol and butanediol (BDO) from Saudi Arabia in July, which caused an unusually public trade spat between the two countries (ref B).  Methanol and butanediol make up 10 to 15 percent of Saudi Arabia's $2 billion in annual non-oil exports to China.  A Ministry of Commerce and Industry official told Econoffs on January 13 that Saudi Arabia was able to convince the Chinese not to impose tariffs on methanol, but said the BDO case was still pending.  The Ministry recently appointed a new Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs, Dr. Hamad Al-Awfy, who will handle all anti-dumping issues, he said.  Al-Awfy previously complained to EconCouns that the SAG was increasingly frustrated by the growing number of Saudi companies complaining about Chinese dumping in Saudi Arabia.  Other senior SAG officials have caustically complained about the low quality of Chinese construction and the "short-term, extractive" approach of Chinese companies to investments in Saudi Arabia.   RIYADH 00000123  002.2 OF 003    A MATURING ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP? ---------------------------------  6. (C) China recently surpassed the U.S. as the largest importer of Saudi oil.  Saudi Arabia's investments in China have increased significantly over the last few years, including a $3.5 billion refinery in Fujian and a $2.86 billion joint-venture petrochemical complex in Tianjin. Additionaly, President Hu Jintao commemorated the opening of a cement plant when he visited Saudi Arabia in February 2009.  Saudi Arabia,s more forward-leaning approach, including large-scale investments in China, indicates a maturing of the bilateral relations and assumes a more pro-active, rather than reactive, role towards economic engagement. (Note: China is now the SAG's number two trade partner after the U.S.  Saudi-Chinese bilateral trade was estimated at $40 billion in 2008, while Saudi-U.S. trade was estimated at $67 billion during the same time period.  End note.)   FM SAUD PRODS, FM YANG RESPONDS -------------------------------  7. (U) While trade issues dominated FM Yang's agenda, both he and FM Prince Saud-Al Faisal commented on the regional political landscape in a press conference that followed their bilateral meeting.  FM Saud spoke out against Israeli defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and called on China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to "deal with world disputes in accordance to international legitimacy...as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative." The meetings with FM Yang were "part of a framework of coordination and consultation," FM Saud continued, that included not only the Palestinian cause but also Iran's nuclear file, Iraq and Yemen.  In particular, he emphasized China's role as a member of the P5 plus 1 group and their responsibility "to solve the (Iranian nuclear) crisis through dialogue and peaceful means.  "Our two nations are keen that the Middle East and the Gulf should be free of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons," he stressed.  8. (U) In response to FM Saud's comments, FM Yang said China called for serious negotiations between Israel and Palestine that would carry out the peace process and establish the State of Palestine.  "China is ready for cooperation with the world community to work for stability in the Middle East," he added.  In regard to Iraq, he said that China extended assistance by reducing Iraqi debt obligations to China and forging trade agreements between Iraqi and Chinese companies.  With respect to Iran, FM Yang said the Iranian file should be solved through "political diplomatic channels which help stabilize the situation in the region."   FM SAUD: CHINA NEEDS TO MORE ACTIVELY COUNTER IRANIAN NUKES ---------------------------------------------  9. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Prince Torki told visiting NEA A/S Feltman on January 26 (ref C) that FM Saud had pressed the Chinese Foreign Minister hard on the need to be more active in working with the rest of the international community and the UN Security Council to counter the threat of Iran developing a nuclear weapon.  FM Saud told FM Yang that Saudi Arabia was convinced Iran intended to develop a nuclear weapon, despite its assurances, and that only concerted international action could stop that.   While no explicit bargain was discussed, Dep FM Torki explained that Saudi Arabia understood China was concerned about having access to energy supplies, which could be cut off by Iran, and wanted to attract more trade and investment.  Saudi Arabia was willing to provide assurances on those scores to China, but only in exchange for tangible  Chinese actions to restrain Iran,s drive for nuclear weapons.   COMMENT: --------  9. (C) Since King Abdullah's historic visit to Beijing in January 2006, the Saudi-Chinese relationship has focused predominantly on energy and trade.  However, the relationship may be showing signs of political evolution.  While the Chinese would likely prefer to stay away from political controversy, their economic power and permanent seat on the UN Security Council has made it more and more difficult for them to avoid politics altogether.  10.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  The incentives for the Saudis to  RIYADH 00000123  003.2 OF 003   try and leverage their economic relationship with China for political gain with respect to sensitive regional issues, such as Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are significant and growing.  After patiently focusing on building the economic relationsip since 2006, FM Saud,s public and private prodding of FM Yang indicates the Saudis are ready to try and cash in some political chips.  End comment. SMITH
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 RIYADH 000178  NOFORN SIPDIS  FOR SECRETARY CLINTON FROM AMBASSADOR SMITH  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/10/2020 TAGS: OVIP PREL PGOV PTER SA YM IR ECONSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY CLINTON'S FEB 15-16 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA  Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES SMITH REASONS 1.4 (B) & (D)  INTRODUCTION ------------  1. (C) Madam Secretary, Mission Saudi Arabia warmly welcomes your visit to the Kingdom, a country which, by virtue of its energy resources, financial power, counterterrorism efforts, and leadership of the Muslim world, plays a critical role in many global and regional issues of importance to us.  Your visit comes at a time of emerging opportunities for engagement to advance the goals that you and the President have laid out in your speeches in the region.  2.  (C) Our alliance with Saudi Arabia, while complicated and subject to occasional disjunctions, has proven durable. Taking stock of where we stand, we see a mixed picture. The good news is that the Saudi leadership still sees the United States as its most important strategic partner and guarantor of its stability.  We also share many global and regional objectives, including the need for global financial and energy stability, a common view of threats posed by terrorism and extremism, the dangers posed by Iran and destabilization in Pakistan, and the linkage that progress toward Middle East peace has to virtually all other regional issues.  Finally, Saudi Arabia has become one of our most important allies in the fight against Al-Qaida and terror financing.  3.  (C) The bad news is that we differ on tactics in some key objectives, and we are often frustrated by Saudi unresponsiveness and a dearth of interlocutors among an aging collective leadership. The status of women, religious freedom, and human rights are ongoing concerns.  On the Saudi side, King Abdullah believes we are not always reliable, consistent, or willing to heed his advice on important issues such as Iraq. Saud Al-Faisal and others have openly been critical of U.S. policies they describe as having shifted the regional balance of power in favor of arch-rival Iran. Differences of opinion on some of these issues can be exacerbated by our differing cultures and value systems, which can introduce a degree of skepticism and hesitancy in the relationship.  4. (C) Despite the problems, a negative assessment of the bilateral relationship would miss a critical point relevant to U.S. goals in the region:  Saudi Arabia is a country in transition, and the changes underway present opportunities for engagement that can advance U.S. interests and national security. Saudi Arabia faces transitions on multiple levels, from the geopolitical, where its trade and energy relations are shifting from west to east, to economic, where greater integration in the world economy is steadily exposing Saudis to international best practices.  Domestically, greater access to internet and cell phones is unleashing new forms of social activism, something demonstrated by an outpouring of Saudi spontaneous voluntary assistance in the aftermath of the Jeddah floods.  EDUCATION & DIVERSIFICATION TO COMBAT EXTREMISM --------------------------------------------- --  5. (C) Having faced down what amounted to an insurgency by Al-Qaida from 2003 to 2006, Saudi Arabia's leadership acknowledged the pressing need for systemic reforms to combat extremist ideology and provide for a rapidly expanding population (the annual growth rate is about 2 percent).  King Abdullah's strategy is two-pronged:  he has attacked the roots of the extremism that fed Al-Qaida through education and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most reactionary elements of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment.  He is also promoting economic diversification.  The King is keenly aware of the urgent need to make Saudi education more relevant to today's workplace and increase the role of women in the economy, goals which remain controversial in this deeply conservative, inward-looking desert Kingdom.  Guided by a vision that dovetails with some key elements of the President's Cairo speech, King Abdullah has begun to implement an ambitious plan to transform Saudi Arabia's economy away from excessive  RIYADH 00000178  002 OF 005   reliance on hydrocarbons and towards a knowledge-based economy that can provide sustainable development for the long-term.  Achieving these goals will require nothing short of a revolution in the education system and significant changes in most aspects of Saudi society, especially the status of women.  6. (U) Seen from the outside, the pace of political reform seems glacial (a notable exception is that changes introduced after the WTO negotiations have been very fast for any country; regulatory agencies are also standing up quickly). Yet for certain elements of Saudi society, the changes are coming too fast.  Whatever the pace, however, the reality is that serious reforms are gradually but irrevocably changing Saudi society.  Recently implemented reform measures include re-shuffling the Ministry of Education's leadership last February (bringing in the King's pro-reform son-in-law as the new minister); a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges; the creation of a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business here; the creation of a regulatory body for capital markets; the construction of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (the country's new flagship and controversially-coed institution for advanced scientific research); and a substantial budgetary investment in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government is also encouraging the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom has a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism.  The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflects these priorities -- about 25 percent is devoted to education alone -- and amounts to a significant economic stimulus package.  U.S. PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT REFORM & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -----------------------------  7. (SBU) Saudi officials have been candid in stressing the importance they place on strong ties with the United States to help them meet reform challenges, both through increased engagement at the government level, including educational exchanges and more FDI, particularly in energy, high tech, and manufacturing.  The past year has seen several large investments by prominent U.S. firms in advanced technology areas, and we are working to raise the profile of our trade and investment relations, including through a major Saudi exposition in Chicago at the end of April.  The Mission has also steadily expanded USG engagement in education, public health, science & technology, entrepreneurship, and civil society.  There are now more than 22,000 Saudi students studying in the US, exceeding pre-9/11 levels.  Public health engagement has included breast cancer awareness and CDC cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network that protected this year,s 3 million Hajj pilgrims.  Our Science & Technology umbrella agreement is already expanding cooperation, including new projects with NASA. Our MEPI programs include a first-time ever exchange visit by a group of Saudi judges, leadership development for women, prevention of violence against women and children, and youth exchange and study. One female participant in our Social Entrepreneurship Forum was a finalist in the 2009 Global Student Entrepreneur Awards. She and seven other Saudi entrepreneurs will attend the President's April summit. Mission elements have also provided training to help the SAG implement a new law to combat trafficking in persons. Intensive engagement with the SAG on IPR is another success story.  You will want to congratulate Saudi officials for the significant progress Saudi Arabia has made over the last several years in improving IPR protection, which resulted in the Special 301 Committee deciding to remove Saudi Arabia from the Watch List.   SAUDI STRATEGIC CALCULATIONS ----------------------------  8. (C) TURNING EAST:  Saudi Arabia is trying to come to terms with the shift in global energy and trade ties towards Asia,  RIYADH 00000178  003 OF 005   which has both political and economic consequences. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China will soon be Saudi Arabia,s largest importer.  Saudi Arabia has also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery.  Increased trade has also brought increased friction, including anti-dumping complaints from both sides.  Saudi Arabia is thinking through how best to take a leaf from the Chinese playbook and use these expanded trade ties to achieve important political goals.  In this regard, Saudi Arabia has told the Chinese that it is willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons.  9. (S/NF) COUNTERING IRAN: We expect that Saudi Arabia will continue to develop its ties with China, in part to counterbalance relations with the West.  While the King's preference is to cooperate with the U.S., he has concluded that he needs to proceed with his own strategy to counter Iranian influence in the region, which includes rebuilding Riyadh-Cairo-Damascus coordination, supporting Palestinian reconciliation, supporting the Yemeni government, and expanding relations with non-traditional partners such as Russia, China, and India to create diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran that do not directly depend on U.S. help. The King told General Jones that if Iran succeeded in developing nuclear weapons, everyone in the region would do the same, including Saudi Arabia.  10. (S/NF) The King is convinced that current U.S. engagement efforts with Tehran will not succeed; he is likely to feel grimly vindicated in his view by Ahmadinejad's February 11 boast that having successfully enriched uranium to a level of 20 percent, Iran "is now a nuclear nation."  The King told General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime -- which he encouraged -- but he also urged that this be done covertly and stressed that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive.  The King assesses that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained.  The King will want you to elaborate on the President's statement that the time for sanctions has come. He will also want to hear our plans for bolstering Gulf defenses vis a vis Iran.  (The King has invited General Petraeus to his desert camp for discussion on this topic on Tuesday.)  11. (C) CLIMATE CHANGE:  Your visit offers an important opportunity to head off a serious clash over climate change. Saudi officials are very concerned that a climate change treaty would significantly reduce their income just as they face significant costs to diversify their economy.  We want to get beyond the obstructionism that Saudi negotiators have often shown during the negotiations and persuade senior leaders to work with us in a partnership to meet their strategic concerns, including by cooperating on developing solar and biomass energy.  The King is particularly sensitive to avoid Saudi Arabia being singled out as the bad actor, particularly on environmental issues.  Your conveying the importance the President places on working as partners with Saudi Arabia on the Copenhagen process will be very important in making this dialogue more constructive.  Secretary Chu intends to explore specific areas of collaboration during his February 21-23 visit.  SAUDI REGIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS --------------------------------  12. (S) PREVENTING A COLLAPSE OF YEMEN:  Saudi participation in international diplomatic efforts to stabilize Yemen reflect Saudi fears that instability on its southern border is a clear and present danger.  The King will tell you that Yemen's strategic location makes an Al-Qaida presence there more threatening than in Afghanistan; he will stress the need to support Yemeni unity, despite his mistrust of Ali Abdullah Saleh.  With respect to Saudi involvement in the war against the Houthis, the King will stress that the SAG's motivation was self-defense.  As Al-Qaida infiltrators from Yemen multiplied, the SAG concluded that the Houthi rebellion had distracted Saleh's government to the detriment of Saudi  RIYADH 00000178  004 OF 005   security.  The military intervention was triggered by a Houthi incursion into Saudi territory, but it presented a long-sought excuse to fortify the porous Saudi-Yemeni border. On February 7, Prince Khalid also informed Ambassador Smith the fighting is wrapping up, and that a ceasefire arrangement could be in place by mid-February.  13. (C) GESTURES AFTER ALL?:  The King appreciates the President's commitment to Middle East peace but is skeptical the U.S. can bring sufficient and sustained pressure to bear on Israel, especially regarding settlements.  The King told General Jones that progress on Middle East peace was only possible if President Obama was willing to pressure Israel, and Saudi officials have rebuffed U.S. requests for confidence-building gestures to help restart negotiations. Despite their adamant rhetoric, however, several members of a private Jeddah-based think tank run by a retired Saudi general have very quietly been participating in Track Two discussions, apparently with SAG knowledge, and even put forward a proposal on Gaza.  In a more dramatic public encounter that has provoked commotion in the region, former Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Turki Al-Faisal shook hands with Israeli Deputy FM Ayalon to settle a dispute over joint seating at a Munich conference. Both sides have since insisted the gesture did not signal changes in policy, with a "senior Saudi diplomat" issuing a statement emphatically denying that the incident constituted any form of recognition for Israel.  14. (S/NF) AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN:  King Abdullah firmly believes that Asif Zardari is the primary obstacle to the government's ability to move unequivocally to end terrorist safe havens there ("when the head is rotten, it affects the whole body").  The King told General Jones that U.S. development assistance would rebuild trust with the Army, which he asserted was staying out of politics in deference to U.S. wishes, rather than doing what it "should."  On Afghanistan, the King has expressed support for the new U.S. strategy, saying that spending on roads, schools, hospitals and mosques would dissipate popular mistrust and help rebuild the country.  The King has not yet acknowledged the Saudi role in Taliban mediation in conversations with USG officials; GIP Director Prince Muqrin has explained to several recent USG visitors that the SAG prefers to keep such discussions in intelligence channels until any agreement is reached.  Perhaps reflecting this, the Saudi media downplayed President Karzai's recent visit and the Afghan Ambassador reported that the meeting with the King lasted only ten minutes.  A NOTE ABOUT THE KING ---------------------  15. (C) The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques will offer you a traditional Saudi welcome at the desert "encampment" outside Riyadh, where he likes to spend his winter vacations.  You will find in 86-year old King Abdullah a wry and forthright interlocutor.  Having struggled with a speech impediment throughout his life, he tends to express himself tersely.  Reflecting his Bedouin roots, he judges his counterparts on the basis of character, honesty, and trust. He expects commitments to be respected and sees actions, not words, as the true test of commitment; and he expects good-faith consultations, not surprises.  Once the King has lost trust in a counterpart, as has been the case with Nouri Al-Maliki or Asif Zardari, his personal antipathy can become a serious obstacle to bilateral relations.  On the other hand, as with President Obama, the King's esteem will help navigate differences and at times change policies.  The King is undoubtedly looking forward to his discussions with you, and Mission Saudi Arabia enthusiastically looks forward to supporting your visit.  MISSION STAFFING ----------------  16.  (U) The U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia includes Embassy Riyadh, and Consulate Generals Dhahran and Jeddah.  The entire Mission, representing ten agencies, consists of 605 staff (212 U.S. Direct Hire (USDH) and 393 Locally Engaged  RIYADH 00000178  005 OF 005   (LE) staff). SMITH
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 000173  NOFORN SIPDIS  SECDEF FOR USDP, ISA, ISA/EURNATO  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/11/2020 TAGS: PREL MARR MOPS NATO IT AF IRSUBJECT: SECDEF MEETING WITH ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCO FRATTINI, FEBRUARY 8, 2010  ROME 00000173  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Ambassador Alexander Vershbow for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D )  1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) met with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini during an official visit to Rome on February 8.  On Afghanistan, Frattini was eager to move beyond the London Conference and work to produce practical results for the Afghan people.  He proposed better civil-military coordination at senior levels in NATO, and raised the prospect of coordination on local projects across the Afghanistan-Iran border.  SecDef thanked Frattini for Italy's pledge of more troops for operations in Afghanistan and explained where gaps in civil-military cooperation existed. Frattini believed the international community was lining up against Iran, and encouraged better coordination with countries outside the P5-plus-1.  SecDef warned that a nuclear Iran would lead to greater proliferation in the Middle East, war, or both.  SecDef agreed with Frattini that a United Nations conference highlighting security challenges in the Horn of Africa was a good idea.  END SUMMARY.  ------------ Afghanistan ------------  2. (S/NF) Frattini opened by telling SecDef that the U.S. can count on Italy's full support on Afghanistan, Iran and fighting terror.  He had recently talked with General Jones and Secretary Clinton and relayed the same message.  He expressed a desire to focus on the comprehensive approach in such a way to improve the daily lives of Afghans.  He asserted a need to press President Karzai on delivering improved governance or risk losing support for the mission in coalition Parliaments.  Frattini wanted to get beyond "just talking" -- referencing the London conference -- and noted concrete Italian projects to convert poppy cultivation to olive oil production and to create a national high school for public administration.  3. (S/NF) SecDef commended Rome's efforts to increase Italian contributions, asking whether even more Carabinieri might be available for training the Afghan security forces.  He observed that General McChrystal's emphasis on protecting Afghan civilians has changed attitudes among Allied publics. SecDef said he is pushing the comprehensive approach, noting a need for all stakeholders in Afghanistan to share information effectively.  He said he hoped that NATO's new Senior Civilian Representative, Ambassador Mark Sedwill, could facilitate this.  SecDef recommended a focus on better governance below the level of the national government -- which would take decades to turn into a modern government ) taking advantage of traditional institutions and competent governors at the regional and sub-regional levels and leveraging them into local success stories.  At the national level, however, our priority should be to develop those ministries most critical to our success, such as Defense, Interior, Finance, Agriculture, and Health.  Noting Gen. McChrystal's recent statement that the situation in Afghanistan is no longer deteriorating, SecDef said that much of the challenge is psychological -- convincing Afghans that we can win and that we will not abandon them.  4.  (S/NF) Frattini agreed that civilian-military integration is the weakest part of the Afghan strategy.  He expressed frustration that NATO foreign ministers only discuss issues like agriculture and education while defense ministers only discuss security.  The problem, Frattini suggested, is that they don't talk to each other.  He proposed a joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers, beginning with talks at the expert level.  SecDef responded that Gen. McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry do civilian-military collaboration at the national level on the basis of a Joint Campaign Plan, as do local ground commanders with leaders of PRTs.  What is missing is the level in between -- the regional commands -- and SecDef expressed a desire for Sedwill to appoint subordinates to address this in each RC, building on the  ROME 00000173  002.2 OF 003   example of the civ-mil cell in RC-South.  The effect would be cascading civil-military coordination at the national, regional, and local levels.  SecDef noted that similar efforts by UNSRSG Kai Eide had been hamstrung by resourcing and the UN's aversion to working with the military.  As a NATO representative, Sedwill should not have these problems.  5. (S/NF) Frattini also asked about practical cooperation across the Afghan-Iranian border.  Local incentives for cooperation might undermine weapons and drug trafficking and help co-opt reconcilable Taliban.  SecDef noted that Iran is playing both sides of the street -- trying to be friendly with the Afghanistan government while trying to undermine ISAF efforts.  He noted that intelligence indicated there was little lethal material crossing the Afghanistan-Iran border. SecDef suggested that trade route protection from Afghanistan into Eastern Iran, which is important for local economies on both sides of the border, might be a place to start.  SecDef noted that any effort will need to be coordinated with Kabul.  Frattini agreed this would be a good starting point.  ---- Iran ----  6. (S/NF) Frattini supported recent public statements by SecDef raising the pressure on Iran.  He declared that Ahmadinejad cannot be trusted, especially after contradicting recent constructive statements by his own government. Frattini, citing a recent conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, said he believed Russia would support the sanctions track.  The challenge was to bring China on board; China and India, in Frattini's view, were critical to the adoption of measures that would affect the government without hurting Iranian civil society.  He also specifically proposed including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela and Egypt in the conversation.  He expressed particular frustration with Ankara's "double game" of outreach to both Europe and Iran.  Frattini proposed an informal meeting of Middle East countries, who were keen to be consulted on Iran, and noted that Secretary Clinton was in agreement.  7. (S/NF) SecDef emphasized that a UNSC resolution was important because it would give the European Union and nations a legal platform on which to impose even harsher sanctions against Iran.  SecDef pointedly warned that urgent action is required.  Without progress in the next few months, we risk nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, war prompted by an Israeli strike, or both.  SecDef predicted "a different world" in 4-5 years if Iran developed nuclear weapons.  SecDef stated that he recently delivered the same warning to PM Erdogan, and he agreed with Frattini's assessment on Saudi Arabia and China, noting that Saudi Arabia is more important to both Beijing and Moscow than Iran.  8.  (S/NF) SecDef urged Frattini to reconsider a planned visit to Italy by a prominent Iranian Parliamentarian in the wake of recent executions of students in opposition to the government. At the same time, we needed to ensure we did not discredit the opposition by creating the impression that they are the tools of foreign partners.  -------------- Horn of Africa --------------  9. (C) Frattini expressed concern about deteriorating conditions in Somalia and Yemen.  He noted a recent conversation with President Sharif of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG), in which Sharif said that he would be unable to pay his security forces by the end of February. Frattini said that Italy was encouraging the EU Presidency to focus on Somalia and Yemen, and had proposed a United Nations conference addressing Horn of Africa security issues.  Italy was providing funding to the TFG's national budget. SecDef concurred that the region deserved more focus.  ROME 00000173  003.2 OF 003    10. (U)  SecDef has cleared this cable.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 000087  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/12/2020 TAGS: PREL ENRG KNNP PARM IR PGOVSUBJECT: STAFFDEL KESSLER DISCUSSES IRAN WITH MFA, ENI, PD  REF: ROME 00035  ROME 00000087  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: DCM Elizabeth Dibble for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   SUMMARY   -------   1.  (C)  Staff Director of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HCFA) Dr. Richard Kessler and HCFA staff members probed senior MFA and energy and gas parastatal Eni officials on Italy's intentions concerning Iran sanctions and prospects for effective multilateral action to curb Iran's nuclear program.  Opposition Democratic Party (PD) officials discussed Iran, Italy's role in Afghanistan, the MEPP, Iraq, and nonproliferation with the Staffdel.  End Summary.   IRAN DOMINATES MFA TALKS ------------------------  2.  (C)  A January 8 roundtable discussion with Dr. Kessler and three HCFA staff members at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) included MFA Director General for Multilateral Political Cooperation Stefano Ronca, Ronca's Deputy Filippo Formica, and  Deputy DG for Economic Cooperation Claudio Spinedi.  Office Directors Massimo Marotti (Political-Military Security and NATO Affairs); Diego Brasioli (G8 Issues and Global Challenges); and Giovanni Pugliese (Arms Control and Nonproliferation) also participated. After the roundtable the Staffdel had a meeting with MFA Deputy SecGen and Political Director Sandro De Bernardin.  Post was represented by the Charge, Pol-Mil Counselor and Poloff (notetaker).  3. (C)  Ronca believes the deteriorating situation in Iran will soon come to a head and that the UNSC should convey to Iran that delay tactics will not work and support this position by readiness to adopt further pressure.  Ronca and Spinedi told the Staffdel Italy is ready to explore, with its EU colleagues, the possibility of further sanctions, which, however, must conform to EU regulations, and not affect the legal rights of European companies.  Ronca suggested that the Iranian financial, oil and gas, and insurance sectors (but not the Central Bank) could be targeted and that the list sensitive products on the export ban list could be expanded.  4.  (C)  Spinedi, who (with Formica) attended the October 7 Washington meeting of "Likeminded States on Iran," started by briefly alluding to Italy's longstanding complaint of exclusion from P5 1.  Spinedi pointed out we needed to determine what kind of sanctions would be acceptable to China and Russia, adding that even at the beginning of January, China's UN ambassador said that China "needed more time," which, Spinedi noted, was not a total rejection of tougher sanctions.  Spinedi advocated strengthening what already exists and deciding where we are willing to exert additional pressure (especially in the oil and gas sector).  It would be important to determine which technologies others (e.g., China and India) are willing to provide and embargo those which they cannot.  Spinedi acknowledged that Italy had not yet imposed legally binding sanctions, but that the GOI had successfully used "moral suasion."  5.  (C)  Spinedi noted that sanctions proposed by the U.S. at the October 7 Likeminded meeting included targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command (IRGC), but did not include an embargo of refined oil and gas products.  Spinedi echoed Ronca in saying that in the coming months Italy will need to see how the rest of the Europe will approach new sanctions.  6.  (C)  MFA Deputy SecGen Sandro De Bernardin told the Staffdel that Italy was well aware of the danger posed by Iran and supported a "firm line."  De Bernardin noted Eni's considerable investments in Iran and characterized Italy's "moral suasion" efforts to wean Iran away from its nuclear ambitions as a "significant success."  On sanctions, De Bernardin stated that Italy was prepared to assume its "share of responsibility," but that sanctions are a means of pressure, not a goal; effective ones must be found. In De Bernardin's view, U.S.domestic legislation should not negatively affect other countries and the presidential waiver has been useful in the past; he hoped it will still figure in the future.  7.  (C)  Kessler encouraged Italy to continue and reinforce  ROME 00000087  002.2 OF 003   their past efforts.  De Bernardin agreed that if Iran gets the bomb, then others will seek to acquire nuclear weapons too and that the Iranian regime must realize there is a heavy price to be paid for persisting in non-compliance. "  De Bernardin reiterated Italy's support for openess to dialogue in addition to pressure, or the dual-track approach, and that "putting Iran in a corner" is not the same as "cutting it off" and characterized Italy as a "crucial player," essential to catalyzing consensus in Europe. He added that, given Iran's critical domestic situation, the regime was not in a position to decide anything.   KEY TO SUCCESS IN AFGHANISTAN -----------------------------  8.  (C)  With regard to the critical situation in Afghanistan, Ronca acknowledged that we must strengthen the military aspect of the campaign, but that institution building and engaging President Karzai on fighting corruption must not be neglected. On the security side, Ronca said that Italy will increase its force by 1000 men during the first half of 2010 and that its Afghan National Police (ANP) training program is a first priority.  As for civilian engagement, Italy has committed 465 million euros in various civilian sectors, including health, education, and justice. Ronca and Marotti stressed the need for better coordination of civilian and military activities as an issue that should be on the agenda of the January 28 London NATO conference. Ronca noted that reaching out to insurgents was a task that should also be pursued. The Italians stressed the need for a long-term development strategy based on Afghan priorities, but which would also include private sector involvement and the development of good governance.   CENTER LEFT PD AIRS FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS --------------------------------------------  9. (C)  Head of the opposition Partito Democratico's (PD) Foreign Policy Department Piero Fassino told the Staffdel the PD supports President Obama's initiative  to dialogue and build bridges with the Islamic world, but is very concerned about the blocked MEPP and the "new wave of terror" in Afghanistan.  As for Iran, the PD supports pursuing a negotiated solution, but Fassino questioned whether the current leadership is in a position to negotiate credibly. He suggested it could be useful to change the order of priorities in Iran; that is, be more flexible on the nuclear issue, but harder on human rights.  According to Fassino, the greatest risk with nuclear proliferation is that irresponsible governments like the one in Iran could gain access to nuclear arms, adding that the PD assessed that there was little to fear with nations such as India, Britain, and France having nuclear weapons.  He asked whether a democratic government in Iran might not have a different position on the nuclear program.  10.  (C)  Fassino said the PD supports the GOI's increased (military) support for Afghanistan, but stressed that strengthening civil and governmental institutions and economic development are equally important.  On the MEPP, Fassino characterized Netanyahu's proposed 10-month settlement freeze "a little window of opportunity," but questioned whether it was enough, given the Israelis' refusal to discuss (the status of) Jerusalem.  As for Iraq, Fassino said the stabilization process must be supported; there was no alternative.   ENI JUSTIFIES IRAN ACTIVITIES -----------------------------  11.  ( C ) Energy and gas parastatal Eni (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) officials told the Congressional delegation that it is cooperating to address USG concerns over the company,s Iran activities, but insisted that it will continue to fulfill its contractual obligations there. The company officials said that Eni has understood the USG message to reduce its presence in Iran, and as a result it has already decreased its Iran activities to a minimum level. The Eni officials provided the Staffdel with a copy of the November 16, 2009 CEO Scaroni letter to Ambassador Thorne that states the company,s position (A copy of Eni's letter was provided to EEB in November). Referencing this letter, the officials pointed out that Eni will not undertake new activities in Iran, including no new activities by its subsidiaries, Saipem  ROME 00000087  003.2 OF 003   and Polimeri Europa. They added that following Scaroni,s September 16 meetings in Washington the company also gave up plans for an MOU with Iran for development of the phase III of the Darquain oil field. The officials stated that while EU law prevents the Eni from responding to official requests for information on its Iran operations, it has been transparent in informing the USG on a voluntary basis.  12.  ( C ) The Eni officials stated, however, that Eni intends to carry out exploration and development activities in Iran that fall under its contractual obligations there. The officials acknowledged that this is a  area8 due to the differences of opinion between the company and the USG over what is  activity and what is  The company officials said that they hope to clarify this issue with Washington during separate meetings in January with senior officials from the State Department and Department of Treasury. Pressed for details over the company,s existing obligations, the officials said that it is under contract to meet certain targets of (oil) production in order to guarantee defined levels of production within a given time frame. They added that Eni must keep a certain threshold of production in order to recover its investments in Iran. They also explained that Eni receives periodic (possibly scheduled) payments by Iran in oil equivalent amounts that correspond to the attained target levels of production.  13.  ( C ) The Eni officials admitted the frustrating difficulties of operating in Iran, but stated that Eni's priority is to recover its investments there while meeting EU laws. The officials estimated Eni's total Iran investments at around $3 billion dollars, of which they said Eni has already recovered already about 60 percent (or about $1.7 billion according to one Eni representative). The company officials said Eni still needs to recover about $1.4 billion from its Iran operations. They added that  all goes as planned8 Eni will recover this remainder of its investments by the end of 2013 or early in 2014. They further explained that Eni's Iran contracts provide the possibility of extensions if the company is not able to recover its investments within the stipulated time frame. The Eni officials cautioned that the company may face EU sanctions if it withdraws from Iran due to pressure from USG unilateral sanctions.  14.  (U)  Staffdel Kessler has not cleared this cable.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 RPO DUBAI 000013  SIPDIS NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2035/01/12 TAGS: PGOV IR PRELSUBJECT: IRAN'S GREEN PARTY OPPOSITION: ITS BIRTH AND EVOLUTION (1/3)  CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, DOS, IRPO; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)  1. (C) SUMMARY: Iran's Green Path Opposition (GPO) came into being as a result of the fixed June 12 Presidential election. What started as a movement to annul the election now gives shelter both to those seeking the full set of rights guaranteed them by Islamic Iran's Constitution and others seeking a new system altogether. Although the numbers of those publicly willing to march under its banner have decreased in the face of regime brutality, its current core group, mostly college-age urban youth, have shown no sign of giving up the fight.   But like the regime that seeks to crush it, the GPO is not monolithic and there is a clear gulf between the opposition's elite leadership and the popular movement protesting in the streets.  Remaining outside the umbrella of the GPO is an array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the GPO is unclear.  These groups clearly oppose President Ahmadinejad but do not yet seek, as do many GPO elements, to overturn the entire system. END SUMMARY.    2. (C) NOTE: This is the first in a series of three cables examining the Iranian Opposition since the June 12 Presidential election, what might happen in the short-term, and what the most effective levers of US policy have been so far and what combination may have the most impact in the coming months.    I. BIRTH OF THE GPO  ---------------------------    3. (C) ELECTION BUILD-UP AND ORIGINS OF THE GREEN PATH OPPOSITION: Iran's current unrest began in June 2009, when Iran's lackluster Presidential campaign became energized by a (first-time) series of televised debates among the four Presidential candidates:  former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi (reformist), former Speaker Mehdi Karrubi (reformist), Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezai (moderate conservative) and President Ahmadinejad (hard-line conservative).  President Ahmadinejad's accusations that former Presidents Rafsanjani and Khatami were 'plotting' against his government and, along with Mousavi and other reformists, sought to undermine the Revolution and to enrich themselves, galvanized ordinary Iranians.  Incivility and accusations at odds with obligatory Persian politesse  left many observers with the impression (discomforting for some, energizing for others) that the elections might actually be more of a true contest than past elections, and that Ahmadinejad might actually be vulnerable to an upset.    4. (C) These Presidential debates sparked popular interest in the election, and in the last week or so before the June 12 vote reformist candidate Mousavi, with active and behind-the-scenes support from Khatami and Rafsanjani, increasingly gained momentum, with his supporters for the first time beginning to speak publicly of a 'Green Movement.' Part of his support were young, first-time voters; part were revitalized older 'Second of Khordad' reformists who had turned out in record number to support Khatami in 1997 and 2001, but who had subsequently sourced on politics due to Khatami's inability to effect change.  Another large group of first-time voters were from the ranks of the "Khamoush" ('silent') - ie, Iranians who had never voted but who were inspired by prospects for positive change and had hope that this election would be genuine. Mousavi may have even drawn some support for older and more conservative voters who remembered his steady stewardship of Iran's economy during his stint as Prime Minister during the 1980's Iran-Iraq War.    5. (C) ELECTION DAY: IRIG elections have never been 'free and fair,' but until June 2009 most electoral machinations consisted primarily of the conservative Guardian Council screening out ideologically undesirable candidates, plus vote manipulation at relatively low levels, including using the Basij to 'get out the vote.'  Conventional wisdom going into June 12 was that a high turnout -- representing energized young and urban voters -- would favor Mousavi, who would need a few million vote 'cushion' in order  DUBAI 00000013  002 OF 006   to either win outright or to get into a subsequent two-man runoff with Ahmadinejad.  While we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won big' in the first round.    6. (C) Why the fix? In retrospect, many of the reasons seem clear. Part of the answer could relate to SLK's desire to have unified control over the three branches of government to strengthen Iran's hand, and his hand personally, in expected upcoming negotiations with the West and the US over nuclear issues.  More certainly, part of the answer is that after the 1997-2005 Khatami Presidency, Supreme Leader Khamenei (SLK) was determined to prevent any reformist, especially his former political opponent Mousavi, from heading the Executive Branch.  SLK considers Rafsanjani his most serious rival, and is also intimidated by Khatami's popularity. Therefore, that both Rafsanjani and Khatami supported Mousavi may have led SLK to conclude that a Mousavi victory would consolidate power in the hands of those bitter rivals and leave him unacceptably vulnerable to marginalization.  And part of the answer relates to the increasingly powerful IRGC hardline faction that had supported Ahmadinejad (AN) in 2005, whose support AN strengthened over the subsequent four years by using government funds and patronage to increase this faction's power and wealth. As such, this hardline IRGC faction, composed mostly of high-level officers with a shared intelligence-security background, wanted 'four more years,' despite mixed support for AN from within the IRGC ranks. Anecdotal information indicates that this hardline faction had convinced SLK that the election could be fixed with minimal backlash.    7. (C) They were wrong, as shown by the unprecedented sight of millions of ordinary Iranians pouring into the streets chanting 'where is my vote.' On June 19, SLK abandoned his carefully cultivated pretense of non-partisanship and took the first steps down the long road of post-election suppression when he lauded the 'epic' June 12 vote and told those disputing the results to stop protesting and fall in line or face the consequences.  In response, what started as the pre-election 'Green Movement' slowly began changing into the 'Green Path of Hope' Opposition (GPO), as reformist leaders Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami signaled that they would not stand down.    8. (C) REGIME RESPONSE:  Regime reaction to ongoing post-election GPO activity was swift, conducted at both the popular and elite level:    - At the elite level the regime began a widespread intimidation campaign to include Stalinesque show trials, rounding up not only 'all the usual suspects' (i.e. first-tier reformists, primarily those associated with Khatami's 'Second of Khordad' movement), but also their family members, in addition to second-tier reformists, political and human rights activists, and reporters.  Many if not most of these detained, to include those arrests that garnered the most publicity in the West, played no significant role in either promoting  Mousavi's candidacy or in engendering post-election protests.  However anecdotal evidence indicates there have been extensive arrests of younger, lesser-known activists more active in the GPO.   Within the regime, SLK acted quickly to bring into line as many key power brokers as possible, including traditional conservatives like Majlis Speaker Larijani, former IRGC commander (and defeated Presidential candidate) Mohsen Rezai, and Tehran Mayor Qalibaf - all of whom oppose Ahmadinejad and would have been happy to see him go, but whose loyalty to the System and to the Leader trumped concerns they may have had about the extent of the voting fraud.    - At the popular level the regime increasingly resorted to force on those public holidays when GPO supporters took to the streets. The following were the key dates on which the GPO took to the streets:  DUBAI 00000013  003 OF 006   -- 20 June 2009:  The day after SLK's gauntlet-throwing Friday Prayer speech saw several hundred thousand Iranians march in Tehran to protest, and also witnessed the first significant use of regime force against protestors.  The killing of one young marcher, Neda Agha Soltani, captured on video, focused global attention on the protests and gave the GPO a tragic but iconic image of martyrdom to wield against the regime.       -- June 28, 2009 (7th of Tir): The first time the GPO used the cover of an officially sanctioned ceremony to rally against the government.  GPO supporters, led by a key Mousavi aide, caught security forces off guard by taking over an annual ceremony to mark the 1981 bombing that killed several leaders of the Revolution.       -- July 17, 2009: The first and only time since June 12 when former President Rafsanjani, in many ways the main target of hardline regime animus, was allowed to give the Tehran Friday Prayer sermon.  Rafsanjani's much anticipated speech, in which he did not acquiesce to the official election results, energized opposition supporters and led to street clashes.       -- September 18, 2009 (Ghods Day): The government-orchestrated event to demonstrate solidarity with Palestinians was co-opted by hundreds of thousands of GPO supporters flaunting green and chanting anti-government slogans.  Ghods Day was the zenith of the GPO's ability to bring significant number to the streets, and the last time when security forces by and large eschewed violence;       -- November 4, 2009 (US Embassy Takeover Anniversary): The GPO hoped to replicate Ghods Day during the first large-scale protest since university campuses reopened. Increasingly ominous warnings from the security forces and revelations of detainee abuse resulted in smaller GPO turnout, and more violent clashes than previously;       -- December 27, 2009 (Ashura and 7th Mourning Day for Grand Ayatollah Montazeri): Ashura witnessed the most violent clashes since June 20, with at least nine killed.  Violent clashes also took place in major cities outside of Tehran.    II. WHERE WE ARE NOW  ----------------------------------    9. (C) WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION: Up to now the GPO's most significant tool of resistance is popular turnout in the form of peaceful marching and civil disobedience on those holidays when the regime cannot prevent people taking to the streets. However, ongoing regime violence against protesters has decreased GPO turnout, from the millions of June 15 to a smaller committed core of (at most) hundreds of thousands. Much if not most of them are young, college-age Iranians, and understandably the vast majority of opposition turnout appears to have been in Tehran, although other major urban centers have also seen sporadic unrest. Although the number of GPO'ers willing to take to the streets has decreased from the days immediately following the June election, those remaining on the streets seem to have radicalized, with at least some opposition animus from AN to SLK: the new emblematic chant is no longer 'where is my vote' but 'death to the dictator (i.e. SLK).' At the elite level, not only are Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami the focus on hardline regime pressure, but former President Rafsanjani is under ongoing attack by these same forces.  DUBAI 00000013  004 OF 006   10. (C) The GPO has a strong 'brand' - green, freedom, peace signs, silent marches, stolen election and martyrs like Neda Agha Soltani. But like the regime that seeks to crush it, the GPO is not monolithic. To characterize the GPO's active core as now primarily (but not exclusively) university students and university-age youth in a country so demographically young (for example, approximately one quarter of the population is in its twenties) is not to belittle its potential.  Outside of the active GPO core group there is a larger, relatively passive group, whose support now mostly manifests in the anonymous shouts of 'God is Great' from night-time North Tehran rooftops or who scrawl or stamp anti-regime slogans on ten thousand Toman currency notes. Presumably many of them have fled the field due to fear of regime reprisal but might be drawn back into the fray if the prospects of a GPO victory, however defined, became more real to them than the prospect of blows from a Basiji baton.    11. (C) OTHER OPPOSITIONS: Stepping back, it is wrong to assume that the GPO is the logical equivalent of 'the Iranian opposition,' and indeed it is more accurate to speak of many different Iranian oppositions, each with different constituents and goals, to include the following:    - BUREAUCRACY: AN has effected vast bureaucratic top-down Executive branch personnel changes, ignoring the technocratic cadre that was the recruitment pool for the Rafsanjani and Khatami presidencies. Given his preference for ideology over expertise ('mota'hed' versus 'motakhasses'), he has staffed his government largely from within the current and former IRGC ranks.  Many of these former ministers, deputy ministers, office heads and other senior bureaucrats have not been pleased with their professional fates.  At lower government levels, there is anecdotal evidence of widespread disgruntlement with if not opposition to AN.    -MILITARY/INTELLIGENCE: AN and his hardline IRGC backers have extensively purged the Intelligence Ministry on the grounds of partisan loyalty, creating a significant cadre of disgruntled former Intelligence Ministry officials. Similarly, there is evidence of at least some IRGC opposition, both within the rank and file and also the upper ranks, at SLK's handling of the election and post-election events.    - INDUSTRIALISTS: AN's massive economic mismanagement and the ongoing economic power grab of 'IRGC Incorporated' has engendered much ill will among Iran's affluent and influential industrial leaders.    - RAFSANJANI/CLERGY: Rafsanjani's institutional power is minimal, but as part of his strategy he seeks to retain/expand his support within Iran's clerical class, although this class itself is increasingly impotent and dependent on government favor .  As one element of the regime's efforts to limit the pro-GPO clergy's influence, it has taken steps in recent weeks to challenge the religious titles and credentials of at least one top-level reformist cleric ("Grand Ayatollah").  This move will not likely endear the regime to many if not most Iranian traditional seminarians who take matters of religious credentials, learning, and hierarchy very seriously, especially given SLK's own lack of qualifications for his religious title.    - 'MODERATE' PRINCIPLISTS: Within the ruling conservative 'Principlist' ('Osulgarayan') grouping there is a significant faction opposing AN, though still quite loyal to SLK and the concept of 'Supreme Jurisconsulate.' One of this faction's leaders is Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, with the Majlis as a whole in an ongoing battle with AN's increasingly 'imperial' Executive Branch. Other major Principlist opponents are Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezai.  DUBAI 00000013  005 OF 006   GPO LEADERSHIP- STREET  ---------------------------------    12.  (C) The GPO has promulgated a new mode of oppositionist organization for Iran.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that GPO leaders, especially Mousavi, have from the start favored a horizontal, diffuse, decentralized GPO structure as opposed to a more hierarchical one.   Indeed, part of the GPO's resilience stems from this defuse and decentralized nature, frustrating a regime that has come to rely on the two-step of identifying and decapitating leadership as its main tool for extinguishing dissent. In this regard communication technologies such as the Internet and SMS technology have been a significant 'force multiplier,' with virtual space in many ways playing the same 'information-center' role now that the networks of mosques played in the 1979 Revolution.  GPO leaders Karrubi, Mousavi and Khatami play a role both symbolic and also operational, with anecdotal evidence indicating that they are playing at least a limited role in coordinating with if not leading the GPO masses.   Additionally, for the first time since the Revolution elements of the Iranian Diaspora seem to be playing a role within events in Iran, coordinating with GPO leadership elements inside the country.    13. (C) Distance between the titular GPO leadership and the street may yield tactical advantages, though it also reflects a gulf between the leadership and the popular opposition. Mousavi, Karrubi, and Khatami are longstanding fixtures of the Islamic Republic, making them ill suited to lead a radicalizing movement calling for the overthrow of that system.  Certainly they retain support from the broader opposition, but many, and particularly the more radicalized elements, do not look to Mousavi et al for leadership.  In particular, IRPO contacts in their 20s and 30s discount the notion that anyone previously associated with 'the Nezam' ('the System') could accurately represent their interests and aspirations.  The regime, however, has proved particularly effective at neutralizing emerging leaders from the post-Revolution generations.    14. (C) Within the GPO there is no consensus on its goals. What started as a movement merely to annul the election results now gives shelter both to those seeking the full set of rights guaranteed them by Islamic Iran's Constitution and others seeking a new system of governance altogether.   Much like the ambiguity in its leadership, the unspecified nature of its goals allow it to have a 'bigger tent.'  Mousavi's recent five point declaration calling for restoring press freedom, creating a fair and transparent election law, freeing all political prisoners, and recognizing the peoples' right to gather and to form political associations and parties, was however an attempt by the GPO leaderships to to begin to delimit the scope of their ambitions.    15. (C) Heretofore the GPO has yet to adopt any sort of an economic agenda or set of grievances as part of a core opposition message, and perhaps the absence of one partially underscores the relative 'bourgeois' leanings of the GPO.   Anecdotal information indicates that unemployment and a potential spike in inflation (expected with the recent decision to end subsidies) increasingly concern a large number of Iranians.  IRPO contacts and Iranian press reporting also indicate another spike in labor unrest, due to the parlous state of Iran's factories and their inability to pay their workers on time. One would think that a message that capitalizes on these economic concerns juxtaposed against President Ahmadinejad's (and by extension the Revolution's) economic mismanagement and continued corruption would attract a wide spectrum of socio-economic groups to a more broad-based GPO.  However, for whatever reason, in contemporary Iran it has been political and not economic themes that have been more effective in mobilizing the Iranian people, and economic concerns on their own have rarely drawn large protests in Iran's thirty-year post-revolutionary history.  DUBAI 00000013  006 OF 006   16. (U) COMMENT:  The June 12 election and its subsequent protests/crackdown was a tectonic shift in Iranian domestic politics.  At the elite level it destroyed Khamenei's non-partisan veneer, placing him securely in the center of a no holds-barred political fray.  It also redefined the sets of insider ('khodi') and outsider ('qeyr-e khodi') so that not only were Second of Khordad Reformists on the outs, but so was former President Hashemi Rafsanjani and those aligned with him.  In this regard, at the elite level the central dynamic in many ways can be seen as Supreme Leader Khamenei, AN and the hard-line intelligence-security IRGC faction on one side and former President  Rafsanjani on the other, with all of Iran's political elite being pressured to openly take sides (NOTE: there is a substantial economic element to this dynamic, as in many ways Ahmadinejad's ascension to power coincides with attempts by a new cohort elite, largely composed of hardline IRGC 'intelligence-security' elements, to secure positions of wealth and influence formerly occupied by Rafsanjani loyalists). Certainly many hardline regime elements see Rafsanjani and his eldest son Mehdi as the 'head' to the GPO 'body,' and assume that if Rafsanjani were neutralized then the GPO's threat potential would be far less.    17.  (C) COMMENT (CONT): According to IRPO contacts close to the Rafsanjani circle, Rafsanjani is still unsuccessfully seeking to persuade Supreme Leader Khamenei that AN and his crowd are a far greater threat to the Islamic Republic than any threat that Khamenei might feel from Rafsanjani, and that SLK should withdraw his support for them.  For their part, the regime continues to pressure Rafsanjani through (inter alia) judicial and other pressure on his family, such that his eldest son Mehdi has fled abroad and cannot return.  A weakened Rafsanjani has minimal institutional power, given that the Expediency Council is subordinate to Khamenei and that the clerics in the Experts Council are too cowed or beholden to the government to oppose them.  As such, Rafsanjani keeps a low public profile while at the same time trying to rally elite support, to include moderate conservatives and influential IRGC commanders.  The regime is unlikely to more directly target Rafsanjani unless and until Rafsanjani were to become more confrontational.    18. (C) COMMENT (CONT): At the popular level, June 12 has revived a popular reformist movement largely quiescent after the eight Khatami years while also bringing large parts of  Iran's youngest generation into the fray.   This opposition, however, is not unified. The GPO now is a bifurcated movement, coupling a largely student-dominated mass following with a titular, elite leadership, and the two parts are not a cohesive whole.  This rather diffuse organization may be a key to its staying power and simultaneously an impediment to building an opposition movement that could challenge the viability of the current government.   Beyond the GPO is an array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the GPO is unclear.  These groups clearly oppose President Ahmadinejad but do not yet seek, as do many GPO elements, to overturn the entire system.  END COMMENT. EYRE
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 RPO DUBAI 000015  SIPDIS NOFORN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 2035/01/13 TAGS: PGOV IR PRELSUBJECT: IRAN DOMESTIC POLITICS: 'FROM CRISIS TO STALEMATE' (2/3)  CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, DOS, IRPO; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)  1. (C) SUMMARY:  At this point the Green Path Opposition (GPO) is more of a persistent problem for the regime than an existential threat, and it is unrealistic to assume that the GPO will be able to effect any 'regime change' in the short-term.  Iran's ruling regime is likely to continue seeing increased violence and suppression as its most effective tool, including in the build-up to mid- February anniversary of the Revolution and the opposition's next planned protests.   However it is unlikely be able to eliminate the GPO, which will continue trying to co-opt public holidays to stage anti-regime protests and also try to increase divisions among regime elite.  Although subsets of the GPO are radicalizing, there is no reason to assume that GPO elements seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most Iranians. The GPO does not mirror the widespread an varied opposition that overturned the Shah thirty years ago, and the standoff now is increasingly becoming a stalemate that (inter alia) imperils the IRIG's ability to engage with the West.  Until a new homeostasis is reached in Iran's political ruling class, progress on issues of bilateral importance will be even more difficult than usual.  END SUMMARY.    2.  (U) NOTE: This is the second in a series of cables examining the Iranian opposition since the June 12 Presidential election, what might happen in the short-term, and what the most effective levers of US policy have been so far and what combination may have the most impact in the coming months.    ON THIS SIDE: REGIME  -----------------------------    3. (C) Iran's current leadership sees the GPO with its periodic street demonstrations more as a persistent problem than as an existential threat. Ideology and personal experience have taught regime hard-liners to equate compromise under pressure with weakness. Supreme Leader Khamenei (SLK) himself is said to believe that the Shah's fatal mistake, and the reason the Revolution succeeded, was because the Shah 'retreated,' in addition to believing that the USSR's fall was due to the same reasons. As such, the regime can be expected to remain committed to using force and repression against the GPO as necessary to both incapacitate its first- and second-tier leadership (primarily through detention) and its rank and file (through detention and violence, to include deadly force).    4. (C) Opposition activists have told IRPO that at least part of the regime strategy is a pre-emptive 'rolling round-up' of not just active GPO elements but also sympathizers. Thus in addition to those it identifies as participating in GPO activities, the regime goes after reformist reporters, feminists, human rights advocates, labor organizers, ageing 'National Front' sympathizers, 'Second of Khordad' Khatami-era reformists who are not active in the GPO movement. According to some foreign-based GPO leaders, informed estimates indicate approximately 2,000 people have been thus far detained.    5. (C) Indications are that the regime is laying the groundwork for using even more violence, to include the broader use of lethal force at the popular level if necessary. This could include executions of those found guilty of 'warring against God,' a term which the regime is prone to define somewhat expansively. And while there is certainly a limit to the regime's willingness to use violence against its own people, there are no indications that it is anywhere near it. One former IRGC officer told an Iranwatcher that the IRGC wants to avoid killing more than a 'few dozen' protestors in any one location on any one day, partially to avoid associations with 'Black Friday' -September 8, 1978 - when mass fatalities in a demonstration turned many against the Shah).  The Ashura-day murder of Mousavi's nephew, in addition to the January 7 incident where security officials seemed to have coordinated shots being fired at a car carrying Karrubi indicate a regime intent to  DUBAI 00000015  002 OF 006   calibrate its level of violence to intimidate the opposition and its leadership.    6. (C) The media press environment is also expected to become far more restrictive, with one prominent reformist newsman telling IRPO that he expects all reformist papers to be shut down in the short-term. The regime continues to block 'subversive' websites, while also stepping up it jamming of satellite broadcasts from both VOA and BBC.    7. (C) In addition to its familiar tools of force and repression, the regime also occasionally feints toward reconciliation, issuing statements counseling moderation and offering up an occasional scapegoat, such as the recent Majlis report blaming former Tehran Prosecutor General Mortazavi for the detainee deaths at the Kahrizak detention center.  In the public thrust and parry over post-June 12 events one regime voice conspicuous by its absence has been that of President Ahmadinejad, who has largely kept silent. This strategy has drawn criticism by some fellow hard-liners, who fault him for his unwillingness to publicly endorse harsh measures against the GPO.    8. (C)  According to GPO expatriate leaders and other sources, the ruling regime can be seen as composed of three groups, with Khamenei still exercising control:    - relative moderates, such as Ali Larijani and Ahmad Tavakolli in the Majlis, and Asghar Hejazi, former Foreign Minister Velayati and former Majlis Speaker Nateq-Nuri all in the Supreme Leader's office. This group seeks to have SLK cease his active support of Ahmadinejad so that he can be removed by the Majlis;    -hardliners, such as IRGC Intelligence Head Hossein Taeb, Khameneni's son Mojtaba, Basij Commander BG Mohammad Reza Naqdi, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, and Ahmadinejad and his own crowd. This group seeks increased use of force, to include lethal force, on the GPO and its leaders;    -  a middle way 'swing' group, composed of SLK himself, his two sons Mostafa and Maysam, and some intelligence officials. This group seeks a middle course between the two above, favoring imprisoning, beating but not mass killing of protestors, and house arrest and intimidation but not arrest and/or execution of GPO leaders.    ON THIS SIDE: GPO  -------------------------    9. (C) Going forward, the GPO seems committed to using public holidays as a show of strength and support, with the next big GPO planned demonstration being the anniversary of the Revolution's victory on  February 11 (22 Bahman). According to at least one prominent GPO activist based abroad, the GPO leadership has a three-part strategy:    - (1)  Maintaining GPO unity while also 'growing' and training its numbers, expanding both geographically and in its constituent class/demographic/ethnic elements. Public street gatherings on key dates are one way of showing solidarity, as are slogans from rooftops, work slowdowns, and other non-violent 'political actions.' It will also seek to expand its use of 'blitz' demonstrations, i.e. rapid assembly and dispersal of protestors, in  DUBAI 00000015  003 OF 006   addition to university demonstrations and other forms of protest. In this regard it seeks to strengthen links with Iran's labor force, many of whom have a tradition of striking over non-payment of wages.  (NOTE: The GPO's diffuse structure, and constant regime pressure, will make implementing better organization and training difficult in the short-term).    - (2) Creating divisions within the ruling elite, by 'peeling off' the moderates around Khamenei. Mousavi's recent statement in which he tacitly accepted the legitimacy of the Ahmadinejad government was a step in this direction. Second of Khordad 'theoretician' Said Hajjarian used to speak of the tactic of 'pressure from below, negotiations from above' as the reformist strategy, and at least some GPO strategists hope that elite pressure from moderate conservatives dismayed at ongoing popular protests will seek to convince SLK to cease his active support of Ahmadinejad, at which point he will be subject to possibly politically fatal attacks from the Majlis due to (inter alia) his financial mismanagement.  These GPO strategists, who curiously also see regime compromise as a sign of weakness, see Supreme Leader Khamenei's 'throwing Ahmadinejad under the bus' as the first step to ultimately bringing down Supreme Leader Khamenei himself    - (3) Continuing non-violent efforts to 'paralyze' the government, largely through boycotts of IRGC affiliated companies, through work slowdowns, and ultimately through strikes.  Some within the GPO see the December 27 Ashura demonstrations as equivalent to the 17 Shahrivar demonstrations during the Revolution, after which the people slowly 'lost their fear' of the Shah's machinery of repression.  However, even the most optimistic GPO leaders acknowledge the movement needs significantly more organization and training before it is able to engage in larger anti-regime activities (NOTE: Another advantage of a non-violent strategy is that such non-violent protests are technically authorized by Article 27 of the Constitution.  As such, any move to anti-regime violence would represent not just an escalation in the likely overall level of violence, but a move from inter-Constitutional to extra-Constitutional opposition).    10. (C) This 3-part strategy, as articulated by a GPO leader based abroad, in many respects depends on the willingness of the mass movement of the GPO for support; whether it has been embraced by the popular elements of the GPO opposition is unclear. Furthermore, the increasing radicalization of popular elements within the GPO potentially undermines this strategy and at the very least makes near-term predictions less reliable.  An opposition that increasingly responds to regime violence with its own violence gives the regime greater license to increase repression even further, creating an unpredictable cycle of violence coupled with greater disillusionment with the regime.    11. (C) MEDIA AND CYBERSPACE: The regime and GPO clash not just in the streets but also in cyberspace, and the GPO can be expected to expand its efforts to create a virtual space in which it can disseminate information to Iranians inside Iran.  It continues to spend significant energies on circumventing Iranian attempts to monitor, control and block Internet access in Iran, and is exploring the possibility of providing satellite high-speed internet access, although funding is the main barrier.  In conventional media, expatriate GPO activists have told IRPO that while in the short-term GPO is forced to rely on satellite TV such as VOA and BBC to get oppositionist news into Iran, it is seeking to create its own news fora, to include its own satellite television broadcast.    NO 2ND REVOLUTION  -----------------------------  DUBAI 00000015  004 OF 006   12. (C)  No one knows or can know what will happen next.  While Iran is not North Korea, since June 12 and the subsequent crackdown it has become harder to follow significant events there, both at the popular and elite level. Foreign media presence has been severely curtailed and domestic media is increasingly censored. And Iran's hardline intelligence-security cabal's 'soft overthrow' fixation has reduced the number and type of Iranians willing to talk frankly to the press (and to Iranwatchers) about domestic events.    13.  (C) Against that backdrop one must note the 'selective perception' bias that tends to over-emphasize the GPO's potency. Some pro-GPO bias stems from their being the (relative) 'good guys' in this drama, to the extent that their agenda encompasses principles dear to Western democracies.  Additionally, Western media's Iran contacts tend to be pro-reformist, with Western press quoting pro-GPO activists and analysts almost exclusively. Also USG officials' interactions with Iranians tend to be largely limited to Iranians willing and able to talk with us, with a disproportionate number of them being those seeking USG assistance in helping fight the regime. Finally and in many ways most importantly 'if it bleeds it leads,' so there are no 'Youtube' uploads on demonstration days of the millions of ordinary Iranians who are going about their business.    14. (C) In this regard, many IRPO interlocutors comment that for most in Tehran, life is going on as normal, with no sensation of living in 'a police state' (except on the key dates targeted by the GPO, and only then for people in specific areas where clashes occur).   In other words, it seems that the vast majority of Iranians, though more critical of the government to greater or lesser degrees, are continuing to live their lives as normal. There is no reason to assume that those 'radical' GPO elements seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most Iranians. At most, it appears that many and possibly most Iranians want a peaceful reform of the system as opposed to another revolution with an uncertain outcome.    15. (C) Having stipulated that no one can assert with confidence what will happen in Iran's domestic situation over the next year, it does seem that, as expatriate Iranian oppositionist Ibrahim Nabavi has written, Iran is moving 'from crisis to stalemate.'  The clash between Iran's government hardliners and the GPO is unlikely to end decisively to the benefit of either side within the short-term, and it is quite improbable  that in the short-term the GPO will in some decisive way 'defeat' the Khamenei regime and change Iran's theocracy into a secular republic.    16.  (C) In terms of the significant metrics by which can judge the course of future events, some of the ones significant both in 1977-79 and now include the following:    - Numbers: The numbers of protestors willing to take to the streets now is an order of magnitude smaller than in 78-79.    - Classes: the GPO as currently constituted doesn't seem to have a significant ethnic or labor component, and doesn't seem to have 'broken out' of Tehran in a significant way to other major urban centers, though we recognize that our awareness of developments outside of Tehran is likely to be more limited.    - Anti-Gov't Activities: Unlike 1979, there have been no paralyzing strikes, bazaar closings, military defections, or signs of the government ceasing to function. Whereas the bazaar merchants in 1979 had the inclination and money to fund striking workers deprived of pay, the there seems to be no such GPO 'deep pockets.' Indeed both elements of the 'bazaar-mosque' alliance that were in  DUBAI 00000015  005 OF 006   many ways the backbone of the 1979 Revolution are singularly absent in today's opposition, as each has been largely co-opted by the government.  There have been no indications that Rafsanjani and the Servants of Construction or Qalibaf's Tehran Municipality are currently a significant GPO funding source.  On a far more limited scale, expatriate 'Second of Khordad' Reformist elements within the Iranian Diaspora are leading efforts to create a fund for the support of detainee families.    - Elite Defection/Emigration: Those hardliners who constitute and support the regime are very likely to remain committed to the fight against the GPO, since they know they would have no role in any new order and would also have nowhere else to go.  However for the GPO, many reformists and oppositionists dissatisfied with Iran's plight would rather quit then fight, as shown by the ongoing brain drain, to include increased exodus of political activists.  Anecdotal information shows that many of larger numbers of affluent and educated Iranians who can be presumed to be oppose the hardliners are taking their families and fortunes abroad.    17. (C) Although much GPO animus has transferred from Ahmadinejad to SLK, it can be assumed that at least part of the movement's support would fade were Ahmadinejad to be replaced by someone less controversial and better equipped to successfully govern. Although SLK has shown that he prefers suppression to compromise, at some point pressure at the elite level might persuade him to abandon or marginalize Ahmadinejad.  Granted, the subsequent Presidential election could provide another spark for future protests, but the point here is that at both at the popular and elite level, at least some oppositionist fervor is still fixated on Ahmadinejad, and would presumably dissipate with his dismissal.    STALEMATE TO CONTINUE  ----------------------------------    18. (C) The IRIG's decision-making process, multi-polar and messy even before this turmoil, has been further strained by the battle between the regime and the GPO as well as by the animosity toward Ahmadinejad from within the regime.  For example, domestic political opposition torpedoed Khamenei and Ahmadinejad's ability to sell the IAEA's Tehran Research Reactor agreement.  Subsidy reform, the most important piece of domestic legislation in years, was passed only after a protracted political cage fight between Ahmadinejad and the Majlis.   Amid the IRIG-GPO stalemate and the accompanying factionalization in the conservative 'Principalist' camp, Iran will be hard pressed achieve consensus and move forward on issues relevant to the USG.    19. (C) As one US-based IRPO contact noted, only one thing is certain, namely uncertainty over how the contest will play out.  It is clear neither regime leaders nor opposition figures are convinced of the path ahead and they are constantly recalibrating and shifting positions.  Moreover, he added, there is hesitancy on the part of all actors to move decisively.  He noted that this was visible in the regime's unwillingness to use the full force of its repressive capabilities to crack down on the opposition once and for all.    20. (C) COMMENT: The GPO is not Poland's Solidarity, and Tehran 2010 isn't Tehran 1978.  In other words, it is quite unlikely that the current Iranian system of government will significantly change in the short-term, and if there were any significant change, it is more likely to be towards a more authoritarian regime than to be towards a more democratic one.   However, having posited why the GPO is unlikely to effect fundamental short-term changes in Iran's ruling system, it is equally true to say that it is unlikely to go away. What makes the preceding important for the USG is the fact that Iran's current domestic strife is a political 'black hole'  DUBAI 00000015  006 OF 006   that swallows all other issues, both domestic and foreign, such that until a new homeostasis is reached in Iran's political ruling class, progress on issues of bilateral importance will be even more difficult than usual.

Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).   1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Commander of the U.S. Central Command General David Petraeus congratulated President Saleh on recent successful operations against AQAP, and informed him that U.S. security assistance to the ROYG would increase to USD 150 million in 2010, including USD 45 million to equip and train a CT-focused aviation regiment under the Yemeni Special Operations Forces.  Saleh requested that the U.S. provide 12 armed helicopters and train and equip three new Republican Guard brigades.  Saleh rejected the General's proposal to have USG personnel armed with direct-feed intelligence present inside the area of CT operations, but agreed to a have U.S. fixed-wing bombers circle outside Yemeni territory ready to engage AQAP targets should actionable intelligence become available.  END SUMMARY.  SALEH: HELICOPTERS, HELICOPTERS, HELICOPTERS --------------------------------------------  2. (S/NF) CENTCOM Commander General David Petraeus, accompanied by the Ambassador, CENTCOM aides, the Embassy DATT, and EconOff note taker, congratulated President Saleh on successful operations against AQAP during a January 2 meeting.  The General told Saleh that he had requested USD 150 million in security assistance for 2010, a substantial increase over the 2009 amount of USD 67 million.  Also present were Minister of Defense MG Muhammed Nasser Ahmad Ali and Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs Rashad al-Alimi.  Raising a topic that he would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour and half-long meeting, Saleh requested that the U.S. provide the ROYG with 12 armed helicopters.  Possessing such helicopters would allow the ROYG to take the lead in future CT operations, "ease" the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles against terrorist targets, and allow Yemeni Special Operations Forces to capture terrorist suspects and identify victims following strikes, according to Saleh.  The U.S. could convince Saudi Arabia and the UAE to supply six helicopters each if the American "bureaucracy" prevented quick approval, Saleh suggested.  The General responded that he had already considered the ROYG's request for helicopters and was in discussions with Saudi Arabia on the matter.  "We won't use the helicopters in Sa'ada, I promise.  Only against al-Qaeda," Saleh told General Petraeus.  3. (S/NF) Saleh agreed to General Patraeus' proposal to dedicate USD 45 million of 2010 security assistance funds to help establish and train a YSOF aviation regiment, allowing YSOF to focus on al-Qaeda targets and leaving Sa'ada air operations to the Yemeni Air Force.  Without giving much detail, Saleh also requested that the U.S. equip and train three new Republican Guard brigades, totaling 9,000 soldiers.  "Equipping these brigades would reflect upon our true partnership," Saleh said.  The General urged Saleh to focus first on the YSOF aviation regiment.  AQAP STRIKES: CONCERN FOR CIVILIAN CASUALTIES ---------------------------------------------  4. (S/NF) Saleh praised the December 17 and 24 strikes against AQAP but said that "mistakes were made" in the killing of civilians in Abyan.  The General responded that the only civilians killed were the wife and two children of an AQAP operative at the site, prompting Saleh to plunge into a lengthy and confusing aside with Deputy Prime Minister Alimi and Minister of Defense Ali regarding the number of terrorists versus civilians killed in the strike.  (Comment: Saleh's conversation on the civilian casualties suggests he has not been well briefed by his advisors on the strike in Abyan, a site that the ROYG has been unable to access to determine with any certainty the level of collateral damage. End Comment.)  AQAP leader Nassr al-Wahishi and extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may still be alive, Saleh said, but the December strikes had already caused al-Qaeda operatives to turn themselves in to authorities and residents in affected areas to deny refuge to al-Qaeda.  Saleh raised the issue of the Saudi Government and Jawf governorate tribal sheikh Amin al-Okimi, a subject that is being reported through other channels.  SHIFTING AIRSTRIKE STRATEGIES -----------------------------  5. (S/NF) President Obama has approved providing U.S. intelligence in support of ROYG ground operations against AQAP targets, General Petraeus informed Saleh.  Saleh reacted coolly, however, to the General's proposal to place USG personnel inside the area of operations armed with real-time, direct feed intelligence from U.S. ISR platforms overhead. "You cannot enter the operations area and you must stay in the joint operations center," Saleh responded.  Any U.S. casualties in strikes against AQAP would harm future efforts, Saleh asserted.  Saleh did not have any objection, however, to General Petraeus' proposal to move away from the use of cruise missiles and instead have U.S. fixed-wing bombers circle outside Yemeni territory, "out of sight," and engage AQAP targets when actionable intelligence became available. Saleh lamented the use of cruise missiles that are "not very accurate" and welcomed the use of aircraft-deployed precision-guided bombs instead.  "We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours," Saleh said, prompting Deputy Prime Minister Alimi to joke that he had just "lied" by telling Parliament that the bombs in Arhab, Abyan, and Shebwa were American-made but deployed by the ROYG.  ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MIL-MIL RELATIONS -----------------------------------------  6. (S/NF) General Petraeus praised cooperation between the Embassy and the NSB, YSOF, Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG), and Counterterrorism Unit (CTU), but singled out relations with the Yemeni Air Force as problematic.  Only four out of 50 planned U.S. Special Operations Forces Command training missions with the Yemeni Air Force had actually been executed in the past year, he said.  Saleh said he would personally instruct Minister of Defense to improve the situation.  The General also urged Saleh to stop Yemeni Customs' habit of holding up Embassy cargo at the airport, including shipments destined for the ROYG itself, such as equipment for the CTU. Saleh laughed and made a vague pledge to have the customs issue "taken care of."  Saleh complained that the ROYG had not yet received the necessary training to operate 17 Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle (ILAVs) provided by the USG in 2008, saying that YSOF needed the training in order to use the ILAVs for CT operations.  The General said he would look into having U.S. Special Operations Forces personnel conduct the training.  7. (S/NF) Pointing to the ROYG's problems in combating rampant drug and arms smuggling, Saleh told General Petraeus that U.S. maritime security assistance was insufficient to cover Yemen's nearly 2,000 km of coastline.  "Why not have Italy, Germany, Holland, Japan, Saudi, and the UAE each provide two patrol boats?" Saleh suggested.  The General told Saleh that two fully-equipped 87-foot patrol boats destined for the Yemeni Coast Guard were under construction and would arrive in Yemen within a year.  Saleh singled out smuggling from Djibouti as particularly troublesome, claiming that the ROYG had recently intercepted four containers of Djibouti-origin TNT.  "Tell (Djiboutian President) Ismail Guelleh that I don't care if he smuggles whiskey into Yemen -- provided it's good whiskey ) but not drugs or weapons," Saleh joked.  Saleh said that smugglers of all stripes are bribing both Saudi and Yemeni border officials.  SALEH WELCOMES LONDON CONFERENCE --------------------------------  8. (S/NF) Saleh told the General that he welcomed PM Gordon Brown's announcement of the London conference and said that the cooperation on Yemen between the U.S., EU, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE would be benefitial.  Qatar should not be involved, however, because "they work with Iran."  In this regard, Saleh also identified Qatar as one of those nations working "against Yemen," along with Iran, Libya, and Eritrea.  9.

Inc. (Ref A).  These gyroscopes, which are controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and China's missile-related export controls, would be suitable for use in the guidance systems of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles.  We requested China investigate this information because ECL is associated with a network of Iranian-controlled front companies that procure sensitive goods on behalf of a number of Iranian entities of proliferation concern.  3.  (S) Chinese officials agreed to investigate this information, but asked for additional details on ECL's relationships with firms in Iran (Ref B).  To support their efforts in this case, we would like to inform them that ECL is part of a network of Iranian-controlled front companies that includes the Iranian firm Shahin Sefid Esta and the Malaysia-based front company Skylife Worldwide Sdn Bhd.  This network procures sensitive goods on behalf of a number of Iranian entities of proliferation concern, including the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737-designated entities Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG) and Ya Mahdi Industries.  We want to provide this information to Chinese officials and emphasize that we believe the transfer of this controlled equipment to a company linked to UNSCR-designated entities would be prohibited pursuant to UNSCR 1737.  4.

(U) This is an action request to Embassy Ankara.  Please see paragraph 7.  ---------- BACKGROUND ----------  2. (S) The U.S. has information about several transactions involving Turkish firms planning to export and import from Iran arms and related material controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement.  Specifically, Iran is interested in procuring Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets; 40 mm automatic grenade launchers; 5.56 mm composite magazines (for M16 assault rifles), and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm composite magazines from Turkey.  In addition, we understand that a Turkish firm may also be pursuing a deal to import plastic explosives and nitrocellulose from Iran.  3. (S) The U.S. wants to provide this information to Turkish officials, request that they investigate this activity and use all available means to prevent these firms from exporting and importing such arms to and from Iran.  In addition to any domestic Turkish authorities that may apply, these activities may also be in violation of both United Nations Security Resolution (UNSCR) 1747 and U.S. domestic authorities.  4. (S) UNSCR 1747: UNSCR 1747, paragraph 5, prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring from its territory any "arms or related materiel."  It also requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft; whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of Iran. The procurement of plastic explosives from Iran would violate UNSCR 1747.  5. (S) The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA): INKSNA authorizes sanctions against any foreign person that transfers to or from Iran, North Korea, or Syria goods, services, or technology controlled by multilateral control lists (e.g., Nuclear Suppliers Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, or Wassenaar Arrangement); of the same kind as those on multilateral control lists, but falling below the control list parameters, when it is determined that such goods, services, and technologies have the potential to make a material contribution to WMD, or cruise or ballistic missile systems; on U.S. national control lists for WMD/missile reasons that are not on multilateral lists; or with the potential of making a material contribution to WMD, or cruise or ballistic missile systems.  Accordingly, the U.S. is concerned that if the Turkish firms proceed with transferring the grenade launchers, bullets, and ammunition magazines, we would be required to report this to the U.S. Congress and the Turkish firms could be subject to U.S. sanctions.  6. (S) The U.S. is also concerned about the potential exports to Iran because one of the items may be of U.S. origin. According to Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) records, Turkey received 181 MK-19 40 mm grenade launchers from the United States in 1995.  However, we do not know definitively if any of these are among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to Iran.  We note, however, that if any U.S.-origin defense equipment (including technical data) is re-transferred to Iran, that would violate Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).  As a consequence, Turkey could lose its country eligibility under the AECA to purchase or lease defense articles, including Patriot or Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles, or services, or to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease.  ------------------------- ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES -------------------------  7. (S) Post is requested to approach GOT officials to pursue the following objectives and to deliver the talking points/non-paper in paragraph 8 below as appropriate:  -- Thank Turkish officials for Turkey's continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of arms or related material to and from Iran;  -- Inform the GOT that we are very concerned that Turkish firms may be exporting to and importing from Iran arms and related material;  -- Note that the export of Wassenaar Arrangement controlled items to Iran could require a report to the U.S. Congress under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) and may result in sanctions being imposed on the entities and individuals involved;  -- Point out that the import of arms or related material from Iran would violate UNSCR 1747, which prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring from its territory any "arms or related materiel" and requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their nationals;  -- Emphasize this is not the time for business as usual with Iran;  -- Remind the GOT that both the DIO and Parchin were designated for an asset freeze under UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, respectively, and were sanctioned by the U.S. under Executive Order (E.O.) 13382;  -- Strongly urge the GOT to use available legal authorities, including appropriate domestic laws and authorities related to implementing UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, to immediately terminate these deals and freeze any assets of DIO;  -- Note that Iran has a long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and that these items could easily end up in the hands of al-Qaida, Hamas, Hizballah, and the Taliban;  -------------- TALKING POINTS --------------  8. (S//REL TURKEY) Begin talking  points:  -- We appreciate the Government of Turkey's continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of military equipment and related materiel to and from Iran.  -- In the spirit of this cooperation, we want to share with you some additional information about Turkish firms involved in dealings concerning arms and related materiel with Iran.  --------------- EXPORTS TO IRAN ---------------  -- We have information that the Turkish firms Mercan Tanitim Dis Ticaret ve Muhendislik Ltd. and Makina ve Kimya Endustrisi Kurumu (MKEK) may sign a contract to export military material to Iran.  -- The items covered by the contract include: FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets; 40 mm automatic grenade launchers; 5.56 mm composite magazines (for M16 assault rifles), and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm composite magazines, all of which are specified on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List.  -- In addition, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) records, Turkey received 181 MK-19 40 mm grenade launchers from the United States in 1995.  We do not know, definitively, if any of these were among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to Iran.  -- We should note, however, that if any U.S.-origin defense equipment (including technical data) is re-transferred to Iran, that transfer would violate Section 3 of the U.S. Arms Export Control Act (AECA).  As a consequence, Turkey could lose its country eligibility under the AECA to purchase or lease defense articles.  This could potentially include Patriot or Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles, or services, or the ability to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease.  ----------------- IMPORTS FROM IRAN -----------------  -- In addition to our information related to the export of arms material to Iran, we also understand some of the same Turkish firms involved in the exports are interested in procuring arms material from Iran.  -- Specifically, we understand that in September 2009, Mercan Tanitim was pursuing a deal with MKEK to import 2,000 kg of Composition A-4 military plastic explosives produced by Parchin Chemical Industries, an Iranian government military company and an element of the Defense Industries Organization  (DIO).  -- We further understand that in September 2009, the Turkish companies Kolorkim Kimya San and Mercan Tanitim were considering a deal to import nitrocellulose (NC) from Iran. NC is a dual-use material that serves as a major component in smokeless gunpowder.  -- As a subordinate of DIO, Parchin acts on behalf of DIO, importing and exporting chemical goods throughout the world. In April 2007, Parchin Chemical Industries was identified as the final recipient of sodium perchlorate monohydrate, a chemical precursor for solid propellant oxidizer, possibly to be used for ballistic missiles.  -- As you know, DIO is one of seven Iranian nuclear-related entities designated for an asset freeze in the Annex to UNSCR 1737.  In addition to being listed in the Annex for UNSCR 1737, DIO was sanctioned previously by the United States for WMD- or missile-related activities under the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act (ISNA), the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, and the Export Administration Act.  -- We would further note that Parchin Chemical Industries has been designated for an asset freeze under UNSCR 1747 and U.S. E.O. 13382 in July 2008 as a consequence of its work on behalf of Iran's ballistic missile program.  We, therefore, urge you, per UNSCR 1747, to freeze any assets of Parchin Chemical Industries that may come under Turkish jurisdiction.  -- We would like to inform you that Turkish firms engaged in business with entities designated under E.O. 13382 are eligible for sanctions if such activities are not halted.  -- Given the UN Security Council's grave concern over Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program activities, we urge you to encourage all Turkish firms to avoid any affiliation with this company.  -- Iran, a U.S.-designated State Sponsor of Terrorism, has a long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and other non-state actors, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Lebanon.  We are concerned that the materials being negotiated for transfer by the Turkish companies in question could be diverted by Iran to such groups.  -- Iran has long supplied non-state actors, including terrorist groups such as Hizballah, with arms and other military equipment.  The terrorist applications of small arms and light weapons (SA/LW) are obvious, but Iran has also supplied terrorists with larger weapons systems that threaten regional security and stability.  -- Failure to prevent these sales could result in the re-transfer of military material and explosives by Iran to groups like al-Qaida, Hamas, Hizballah, and the Taliban. This would harm the Turkish government's reputation as a NATO ally and demonstrated opponent of terrorism, and would reflect badly on the Turkish business community.  -- These transactions could also be damaging to our bilateral relationship as these items can be used to kill and severely injure Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region.  -- Turkey is also required to prevent the transfers from Iran as noted in UNSCR 1747, paragraph 5, which prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring from its territory any "arms or related materiel."  All states are required to prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft; whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of Iran.  -- We believe the arms and explosives acquisitions being pursued by Mercan Tanitim and MKEK with Iranian entities would clearly violate this provision of UNSCR 1747, and that the Kolorkim and Mercan Tanitim deal involving the transfer of nitrocellulose may as well.  -- Action to prevent such transfers would clearly demonstrate Turkey's commitment to the full and effective implementation of UNSCR 1747. Such action would also remove the possibility that these firms could be subject to U.S. sanctions under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA).  -- We strongly urge you to investigate this information and prevent any transfers being contemplated by the entities involved by using authorities available under Turkish domestic law.  -- Please share with us the results of your investigation at your earliest convenience.

We understand this company is likely seeking this material on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Iran's solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity designated under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737.  The fiber being sought by the Iranian company may be controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers Group and could be used to produce rocket nozzles or motor cases for Iran's solid propellant ballistic missile systems.  We want to share this information with Chinese officials and request that they take measures to prevent this material from being transferred from China to Iran's missile program.

(S) Begin talking points/non-paper:  (SECRET//REL CHINA)  --We would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your assistance in investigating this activity.  --The United States has information that in December 2009, an Iranian company was seeking to procure five tons of carbon fiber from Yoon Networks Shanghai Company, a China-based firm operated by a South Korean individual.  --We understand this company is likely seeking this material on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Iran's solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity designated under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737.  --The fiber being sought by the Iranian company may be controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers Group and could be used by Iran to produce rocket nozzles for its solid propellant medium-range and short-range ballistic missile systems.  It also could be used by SBIG to produce lighter motor cases that could potentially extend the range of these systems.  --We believe that the transfer of this material to SBIG poses a significant missile proliferation risk and is inconsistent with UNSCR 1737.  --We therefore urge you to investigate this activity and take measures to prevent this material from being transferred from China to Iran's missile program.  --We look forward to continued cooperation on missile nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information.

S E C R E T STATE 017263   SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2035 TAGS: ETTC IR KN MTCRE PARM RS TSPA SUBJECT: U.S.-RUSSIA JOINT THREAT ASSESSMENT TALKS - DECEMBER 2009  REF: 09 STATE 082572  Classified By: ISN Acting A/S Vann H. Van Diepen.  Reason 1.5 (D)  ----------- (U) Summary -----------  1. (S) A U.S. interagency team -- lead by ISN Acting Assistant Secretary Vann H. Van Diepen -- met with a Russian interagency team lead by Vladimir Nazarov, Deputy Secretary of the Russian National Security Council (full participants list is provided in paragraphs 76-77 below), on December 22, 2009 for a second round of discussions on a Joint Threat Assessment (JTA), as agreed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in the 2009 U.S.-Russia Summit Joint Statement on Missile Defense Issues.  The Russian delegation came prepared to engage seriously, and made  presentations on their evaluation of the missile programs of Iran and the DPRK; a conceptual framework for evaluating the risk posed by various missile programs; Russian concerns about instability in Pakistan and the security of nuclear weapons and missiles there; and the work of the FSB (Federal Security Service) in countering efforts by Iranian and North Korean agencies to either obtain nuclear and missile technologies and materials in Russia or to transship the m through Russian territory.  While the Russians were prepared for discussions of cooperation at a strategic level on countering missile proliferation, their position remained the same: in their analysis, the missile programs of Iran and the DPRK are not sufficiently developed, and their intentions to use missiles against the U.S. or Russia are nonexistent, thus not constituting a "threat" requiring the deployment of missile defenses.  The discussions included a vigorous exchange of questions and answers, and concluded with an invitation by the Russians to hold the next round of the JTA in Moscow in March or April 2010.  The discussions lasted the full day.  End Summary.  ------------------- (U) Opening remarks -------------------  2. (S) Van Diepen recalled that the July 2009 U.S.-Russia Joint Statement called for U.S. and Russian experts to work together to analyze ballistic missile threats and that the U.S. side had provided analyses of Iran's and North Korea's missile programs at the September JTA.  He said that the U.S. side looked forward to receiving Russian perspectives on these programs and discussing areas of agreement and disagreement.  He added that the U.S. hoped that development of a more shared perspective on these issues would help inform how the U.S. and Russia address missile threats bilaterally and multilaterally.  Consistent with the Joint Statement and the non-paper U/S Tauscher provided to Russia in November, this effort also could help the U.S. and Russia assess how to defend against missile threats if that becomes necessary.  Van Diepen ended by underscoring that the U.S. looked forward to detailed discussions and then deciding on potential next steps.  3. (C) Nazarov thanked Van Diepen for reminding both sides of the context for the work of the JTA.  He noted that the July 6 Joint Statement said that experts of both countries would analyze threats of the 21st century and make recommendations for political and diplomatic means to address them.  Russia takes this seriously, and President Medvedev has given the highest priority to this work and has instructed that this work be coordinated under the Security Council of the Russian Federation.  Accordingly, Nazarov said, the Russian delegation includes representatives from all of the Russian agencies responsible for tracking missile threats and countering them.   He added that the Russian side planned to make presentations, focusing primarily on Iran and North Korea.  After that, the Russian delegation would be prepared to comment on the presentations made by the U.S. at the last JTA meeting in July.   He said the Russian delegation had studied these materials closely and had several comments and questions.  4. (S) Nazarov concluded by noting that Russia looked forward to a creative dialogue and robust exchange of opinions between the experts of both sides.  He said Russia would focus primarily  on the threats from Iran and North Korea, noting that Russia believed the long-term strategic interests of the U.S. and Russia largely coincide and that the acquisition of nuclear and/or missile capabilities by Iran, North Korea, or other threshold states is unacceptable. Nazarov hoped that the discussions would be productive and potentially lead to the drafting of a joint assessment, and perhaps to the creation of a joint document.  --------------------------------------------- ---- (U) Russian Presentations on Iran and North Korea --------------------------------------------- ----  Iran:  5. (S) Evgeny Zudin of the Russian Ministry of Defense gave detailed presentations on the Russian assessment of the Iranian and North Korean missile programs, and the degree to which Russia believes these programs constitute threats requiring missile defense responses.  For Russia, the bottom line is that, in essence, neither program constitutes a threat at the moment or in the near future.  NOTE:  Russia did not provide paper copies of either presentation to the U.S. delegation.  END NOTE.  6. (S) On Iran, Zudin made the following points concerning Scud missiles:  --Given the challenging and complex situation of the regional context that surrounds Iran, Iran's leaders view acquiring a missile capability as a deterrent to existent threats.  To that end, they also consistently exaggerate Iran's achievements in missile production.  --The core of the Iranian missile program has been the evolutionary development of liquid-fueled missiles based on Soviet Scud technology from the 1960s.  --Tehran acquired Scud B systems from a number of countries during the 1980s.  --The Iranian version, called the Shahab-1, has a range of 300 km and a reentry vehicle of 1 ton.  --With scientific and technological assistance from North Korea, Iran acquired production capabilities for both the Scud B and the Scud C.  --The Scud C, called the Shahab-2 by the Iranians, has a range of 550 km with a 700 kg payload.  --Iran has also developed and commissioned a medium range ballistic missile (MRBM) called the Shahab-3, based on the North Korean No Dong-1 and using Scud-based technologies. The Shahab-3 has a range of 1,500 km and a 700 kg payload.  --Iran has done a good deal of work to improve the precision and range of this system, creating the Shahab-3M, which Iran claims has a range of 2,000 km, although so far the confirmed range is only 1,600-1,700 km.  --Russia's analysis indicates that this was achieved by reducing the re-entry vehicle weight to 250 kg and improving the engine.  -- Russia also believes that this very nearly exhausts the potential for Iran to increase the range of the Shahab-3 or make further improvements to Scud-based missile technology.  7. (S) Moving on from Scud-based technology, Zudin made the following points on Iran's development of a 2,000 km-range solid propellant system:  --Iran has been developing solid propellant MRBMs/IRBMs with better operational capability since 2000.  --Currently, Russia is seeing the development of a two-stage intermediate (2,000 km) solid propellant missile.  --The first test of this system in November 2007 failed. During the second test on November 12, 2008, Iran successfully accomplished the uplift stage of the missile.  --Following the third test of the missile in May 2009, Iran announced that the launch was successful and that it would begin serial production of this missile.  --This system was tested again on December 16, 2009, and Iran also claimed this test was successful.  --The Russian assessment is that regardless of optimistic statements from Iran, the test of this missile was actually just a test of a successful prototype and that what the test did was allow Iran to practice first stage operation and stage separation.  --Russia believes Iran will need another 2-3 years of testing to perfect the missile.  Russia believes it will not actually be deployed for 5-6 years.  8. (S) Zudin said that another potential success indicator for Iran's missile program is the Safir space launch vehicle (SLV) program.  He said the Safir launch on February 2, 2009 was successful in putting the Omid  (26 kg) satellite into orbit.  However, Iran's first attempt to launch the satellite into orbit on August 17, 2008 was unsuccessful.  Russia assesses that in order to achieve the successful launch, Iran had used the maximum potential of its liquid-propellant technology (the first stage of the Safir was a Shahab-3).  As for Iran developing combat/offensive long-range missiles based on SLV technology, Russia believes, in theory, this is possible. However, from a military technological perspective, Russia believes this is unviable due to low throw weight of the system.  In addition, Russia believes that development of a long-range missile based on its SLV efforts would require Iran to intensify its research and development, conduct a series of test launches outside its territory, and increase throw weight and accuracy.  Thus, in Russia's view, despite Iran's successful launch of a satellite, it is premature to talk about Iran successfully developing the technology for a militarily useful long-range ballistic missile capacity.  9. (S) Zudin summed up his presentation on Iran by noting that over the last four years, Iran has successfully launched a 26 kg satellite into orbit and conducted several successful launches of a solid propellant MRBM, according to unconfirmed information.  However, Russia believes Iran's "success" boils down to creating Shahab-3-class liquid propellant missiles with an accuracy of several kilometers that can reach targets in the Middle East and Southeastern Europe, but given conventional warheads, these missiles cannot do substantial damage.  Under favorable conditions, Russia believes Iran might be able to begin a program to develop ballistic missiles with ranges of between 3,000-5,000 km after 2015, but Russia does not see Iran taking any steps in this direction.  Rather, Russia has concluded that Iran's ballistic missile program continues to be directed toward developing combat ready missiles to address regional concerns.  North Korea:  10. (S) Zudin made the following points with regard to the DPRK's missile program:  --Over the last two decades North Korea has paid increased attention to developing and producing ballistic missiles and SLVs.  --The DPRK has commissioned the production of liquid propellant missiles such as Scud Bs and Cs (which North Korea calls the Hwasong 5 and 6), the No Dong I, the short-range KN-02, and the "Luna-M" tactical missile, plus solid propellant battlefield and tactical rockets.  --The core of North Korea's missile capability is missile technology from the 1960s.  --The potentially outdated No Dong-1, with a range of 1,000-1,300 km and a reentry vehicle of one ton, is the most advanced missile commissioned by the North Korean military.  --In Russia's assessment, only the KN-02, with a range of less than 100 km, is relatively modern.  --Since early in the 1990s, North Korea has slowly developed missiles of the Taepo Dong class.  --Russia estimates that the Taepo Dong-1 (TD-1) was a prototype two-stage liquid propellant missile with a 2,000-2,500 km range.  --The TD-I first stage used a No Dong-1 engine, and the second stage used a Scud engine.  --The only flight test of the TD-I was conducted on August 31, 1998, during which the DPRK practiced separation of missile stages.  North Korea declared this test to be an SLV launch.  --The Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) MRBM is a two-stage liquid propellant missile with a range of 3,500-6,000 km, depending on the weight of the warhead.  --A July 5, 2006 test launch of the TD-II failed as the missile exploded 40 seconds into flight.  --Russia estimates that North Korea tested elements of the Taepo Dong-2 with its April 5, 2009 SLV launch.  --Russia believes North Korea has demonstrated a certain level of progress in the missile area by creating a first stage engine with a thrust of 100 tons.  --North Korea conducted tests of nuclear devices on October 9, 2006 and May 26, 2009.  However, it remains unproven whether North Korea can make a nuclear warhead of the size and weight that would allow it to be carried by a ballistic missile.  11. (S) Zudin said that in Russia's view, the widespread claims about North Korea's achievements in the missile area are dubious.  In particular, Russia notes that it is claimed that North Korea has a new missile based on the Soviet R-27 (NOTE: SS-N-6.  END NOTE) submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that is capable of reaching ranges of 2,400-4,000 km.  However, the many published reports regarding this missile, which is known as the BM-25, contain claims that are made without reference to any reliable sources.  Moreover, Zudin said, the fact is that there have been no successful tests of this missile in either North Korea or Iran.  Russia also is unaware that this missile has ever been seen.  There are claims that 19 of these missiles were shipped to Iran in 2005, but there is no evidence for this and concealment of such a transfer would be impossible.  12. (S) Zudin said Russia believes the real missile potential of North Korea is an impressive arsenal of outdated missiles with ranges no greater than 1,300 km and that are only a threat to countries in the region that North Korea considers to be enemies.  Russia estimates that in the years to come North Korea will devote considerable effort to improving and perfecting its SLV.  To this end, it will use the launch facility near the community of Tongchang-Dong (NOTE: Known to the U.S. as the Yunsong facility.  END NOTE).  Russia assesses that North Korean development of long-range ballistic missiles based on SLVs is possible in principle, but perfection will take years.  The prospects for North Korea developing a combat operational system from such a process is not likely due to the inability to conduct concealed preparations for launch and the long preparation times.  13. (S) Summing up, Zudin said Iran's and North Korea's missile programs can be characterized as follows:  the only real successes are liquid propellant intermediate range missiles with ranges of 1,300 km, and both countries would face real technical difficulties in trying to make additional advances to increase the range of their systems.  --------------------------------------------- ------ (U) Discussion on Iranian and North Korean Missiles --------------------------------------------- ------  14. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russian delegation for its presentations, noting that there appeared to be some areas where both sides agree, other areas where the two sides see the same thing a little differently, and areas where the two sides disagree.  He said it is good to have the opportunity to examine the differences and the reasons for them, and urged that this be done in a structured way.  Van Diepen proposed discussion begin with Iran and North Korea generally, and then move to specific categories of short-range, medium range, and long-range missiles.  On Iran, he said it appeared that both sides had similar assessments at the technical level with regard to short range missiles in Iran. On medium range missiles in Iran, both sides agree there is the original No Dong, a modified No Dong with longer range - although the U.S. and Russia have different ideas of the modifications made to achieve that longer range.  And both sides seem to agree that Iran is developing a two-stage solid propellant missile.  Beyond that, U.S. and Russian assessments seem to diverge.  15. (S) Based on the Russian presentations, the U.S. delegation posed a number of questions.  The Russian delegation also raised a number of questions about U.S. comments and the U.S. presentations on Iran and North Korea from the September JTA talks.  The topics raised and follow-up discussions were as follows:  16. (S) Shahab-3 Reentry Vehicle Mass  The U.S. noted that based on modeling, it assesses that the modified Shahab-3 has 600 kg re-entry vehicle mass at a range of 2,000 km, and asked for Russia to explain the basis for its assessment of 250 kg re-entry vehicle mass. The U.S. also asked how useful such a missile would be as a military weapon.  Russia responded that there is some uncertainty in its estimate, conceding that the 250 kg is at the low end of Russia's estimate.  However, Russia believes that the low weight of the Shahab-3 warhead makes it pointless as a military weapon.  Although the range could be further increased with a lighter warhead, Russia's view is that such a missile also is pointless.  Additionally, while Russia views the U.S. 600 kg estimate as being close to the 700 kg weight of the basic Shahab-3 warhead, it assesses that the range of the system with that warhead is 1,300 km, not 2,000 km.  Russia does not believe that if the weight of the warhead is decreased by just 50 kg, it is realistic to assess that the Shahab 3 would  achieve a 2,000 km range.  17. (S) Aluminum Airframe  The U.S. said that its assessment of a 2,000 km range for the Shahab-3 is achieved through the use of an aluminum airframe instead of steel and increased engine thrust.  Russia asked whether the assessment that the Shahab 3 airframe is made with aluminum rather than steel is based on speculation or fact.  The U.S. responded that the assessment derives from information relating to Iran seeking various aluminum alloys.  Additionally, during the Information Exchange (IE) portion of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary, a number of presentations, including by the UK and France, also assessed that the Shahab-3 has an aluminum airframe and described a number of Iranian attempts to procure aluminum for this purpose.  For this reason there also have been MTCR proposals to add the types of aluminum sought by Iran to the MTCR Annex.  18. (S) Safir Airframes  The U.S. noted that it appears that the first stage of the Safir SLV is the Shahab-3, and asked whether Russia believes the Safir could achieve orbit with a steel airframe.  Russia answered that the facts are that the Safir was used to put a satellite with a very low mass into orbit.  It is likely that the technologies used to achieve this were exploited to their utmost.  Russian analysis showed that the size of the Omid is the limit of what Iran could put into orbit.  The U.S. agreed  that a very low weight satellite was all that the Safir could put into orbit, but assessed that even orbiting such a small satellite could only be done using an aluminum airframe.  In U.S. modeling of the launch using a steel airframe, the Safir was not able to get close to putting anything into orbit.  19. (S) Russia remarked that even if the U.S. and Russia disagree over the materials used in the airframe, both sides can agree that the capability of this missile was used to its maximum to get a satellite into orbit.  If there is agreement on this point, then both sides should be able to agree that using this system as a weapon is pointless.  The U.S. responded that this was not necessarily so and would depend on how the rocket   is used.  The Safir launch might have been a technology demonstrator.  If one clustered or stacked the Shahab, it could be used as a longer-range system.  The U.S. added that something using a single Shahab as its first stage will have limitations, but that is not the only option.  20. (S) Using Clustered Engines  Russia noted that during the JTA talks in Moscow, the U.S. discussed several options Iran would have with regard to a cluster scheme.  However, in Russia's view, the problem with a cluster scheme is that it makes the missile nonviable for military purposes.  The U.S. responded that a cluster scheme would make the system less mobile, but noted that it would provide a possibility for putting a missile further downrange.  However, the basic U.S. point is that the Safir could have been a technology demonstrator for staging, separation, ignition, and control of an upper stage.  Russia noted that it views the Safir launch as a success and has stated this.  Additionally, Russia agrees there are ways to increase the throw weight, including the clustering of engines, but the goal of the Russian review of Iran's missile capabilities was to examine whether the Iranian program could create a combat ready missile that meets certain specifications.  In Russia's view it cannot, and talking about the Shahab-3 as a long-range  combat missile is unrealistic.  21. (S) The U.S. agreed it is not realistic for a mobile missile, but thought it would be realistic for use in a silo or underground.  Russia responded that such a missile would require a fixed launch pad.  Fifty years ago fixed launch pads deep inside a country were survivable, but now that is not realistic.  The U.S. countered that both Russia and the U.S. still have hundreds of such launch sites.  Russia said that was a topic for another discussion, not JTA.  22. (S) Iran Not Capable of Producing Longer-Range Missiles  Russia said its bottom line is that Iran lacks appropriate structural materials for long-range systems, such as high quality aluminum.  Iran can build prototypes, but in order to be a threat to the U.S. or Russia Iran needs to produce missiles in mass quantities, and it lacks materials sufficient for the type of mass production needed to be a security threat.  Russia further noted that the technology for longer-range missiles is sophisticated and difficult to master.  For example, the elongated airframes Iran is using might not survive the stresses of a ballistic flight path, and the guidance system for the missile (Shahab-3) is outdated and does not allow for precision steering. According to Russian calculations, if the control system is used at a range of 2,000 km, it could veer as much as 6-7 km off its target; at 5,000 km, the accuracy could be off by 50-60 km.  In addition, the liquid propellants used by the Iranians are of low efficiency.  Iran is working to improve the power of the engine and develop more efficient kinds of fuel.  However, it faces significant challenges.  Iran also has problems with launch preparation times, although it has made some recent improvements.  23. (S) Launching from Silos  Russia said it does not think a Shahab-3 derived system could be launched from a silo.  Ground launch sites that are for SLVs are not suitable for military launches, and missiles with side-based vent engines and clustered engines cannot be silo-based.  The U.S. responded that this might be an area where U.S. and Russian assessments differ.  For example, the U.S. thinks the Taepo Dong-2 is a clustered missile that can be launched from a silo or underground launcher, adding that there are scenarios to compensate for shortcomings of this technology should the Iranians or North Koreans choose to pursue them.  24. (S) Iranian Solid Propellant MRBM  The U.S. said it does not see the solid-propellant MRBM as a technology demonstrator.  This system has been tested four times in the past two years, and the U.S. assesses Iran will be ready to field it in less than the 5-6 year timeframe Russia envisions.  Russia asked how soon the U.S. thought the system could be ready.  The U.S. said that it would not be surprised if a two-stage system with a range up to 2,000 km were fielded within a year, at least in limited numbers.  The U.S. also noted that not all countries follow the same testing procedures as the U.S. and Russia.  North Korea is an extreme example, but Iran does not have the same test philosophy as either the U.S. or Russia.  25. (S) The Path to Long Range Missile Development in Iran  The U.S. said the main potential avenue for Iran developing long range missiles is by using current systems as building blocks.  For example, using the Shahab-3 with clustered or stacked engines could be one path.  Another path might be the so-called BM-25 missile that the U.S. believes was sold to Iran by North Korea.  A third path might be development of a solid-propellant MRBM with more powerful motors.  Russia said that its views on the Shahab 3 had already been discussed. Russia had some questions about the other two paths the U.S. had identified.  In addition, Russia thinks it also will be very important to consider the intentions of Iran and North Korea that could lead to creation or improvement of its missiles.  This will affect what each side (U.S. and Russia) does to monitor what these countries (Iran and North Korea) do to acquire missile technologies, including procurement methods.  It also will help define the key technologies required by these countries now and in the future and in finding a means for protecting these technologies.  26. (S) The BM-25  Russia said that during its presentations in Moscow and its comments thus far during the current talks, the U.S. has discussed the BM-25 as an existing system.  Russia questioned the basis for this assumption and asked for any facts the U.S. had to provide its existence such as launches, photos, etc.  For Russia, the BM-25 is a mysterious missile.  North Korea has not conducted any tests of this missile, but the U.S. has said that North Korea transferred 19 of these missiles to Iran.  It is hard for Russia to follow the logic trail on this.  Since Russia has not seen any evidence of this missile being developed or tested, it is hard for Russia to imagine that Iran would buy an untested system.  Russia does not understand how a deal would be made for an untested missile.  References to the missile's existence are more in the domain of political literature than technical fact.  In short, for Russia, there is a question about the existence of this system.  27. (S) The U.S. repeated its earlier comment that Iran and North Korea have different standards of missile development than many other countries, including the U.S. and Russia. North Korea exported No Dong missiles after only one flight test, so it is not unimaginable that it would build and seek to export a system that has not been tested.  This is especially true for North Korea because of its need for hard currency.  In the U.S. view, the more interesting question is why would Iran buy a missile that has not been tested.  One possible answer is that Iran has recognized that the BM-25's propulsion technology exceeds the capabilities of that used in the Shahab-3, and that acquiring such technology was very attractive.  Iran wanted engines capable of using more-energetic fuels, and buying a batch of BM-25 missiles gives Iran a set it can work on for reverse engineering. This estimate would be consistent with the second stage of the Safir SLV using steering engines from the BM-25 missile.  28. (S) Safir and BM-25  The U.S. explained that based on a comparison of Internet photos of the second stage of the Safir, the U.S. assessment is that the steering (vernier) engines on the Safir are the same as on the R-27.  The weld lines and tank volumes from the Safir second stage show that the ratio of oxidizer to propellant is not consistent with Scud propellants and more consistent with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), which were used in the R-27.  The U.S. does not have any information on why Iran has not flight tested the BM-25.  It may be due to difficulties assembling the missiles, but it appears that they have at least done work with the steering (vernier) engines.  Russia asked if the U.S. was saying that its case for the existence of the BM-25 missile is that individual elements of the Safir resemble the steering engines of the R-27 missile.  29. (S) The U.S. said that is only part of the case.  In the media, and more importantly in the MTCR Information Exchange, countries have offered direct evidence of the transfer of the BM-25 from North Korea to Iran.  Russia asked if the U.S. had pictures of the missile in Iran.  The U.S. did not, but noted that North Korea had paraded the missile through the streets of Pyongyang.  Russia disagreed.  Russia said it had reviewed the video of the North Korean military parade and concluded that North Korea had shown a different missile.  Russia does not think the BM-25 exists.  The missile appears to be a myth, and some say that it is based on a Russian missile. However, no one has seen it, and Russia cannot find traces of it.  The U.S. said it would endeavor to provide further information on the existence of the BM-25 at the next round of talks, noting that reaching agreement on this point will affect the joint assessment of Iranian and North Korean missile capabilities.  30. (S) Safir Fuel  Russia asked whether the U.S. had any clear images of the Safir that allow for the assessment of tank volumes and the ratio of fuel to oxidizer.  The U.S. said that the weld lines of the second stage are clear in the pictures Iran put on the Internet, and U.S. analysts were able to make pretty good calculations based on this information.  Russia questioned this, saying that the photos did not allow for accurate measurements of distances.  The U.S. undertook to provide more information on this point at the next round of talks.  31. (S) The U.S. then asked Russia for its assessment of the types of propellant used in the Safir second stage.  Russia said it thinks that hydrazine is used.  The U.S. asked whether Russia thought UDMH might be involved.  Russia did not.  It said that there might be different combinations of fuel and oxidizers, but the base is hydrazine.  32. (S) More on Propellants  The U.S. asked whether Russia assesses that Iran is moving beyond Scud propellants.  Russia responded that it believes Iran is trying to move in this direction because it wants something more powerful - something that can lift 40-50 tons.  With bigger engines, Iran can improve missile range.  Thus, Iran has been working to acquire more-energetic fuels and trying to produce UDMH and N2O4.  However, Iran has been working on this for approximately 10 years, and Russia has not seen any serious results.  Russia further noted that Malik Ashtar University in Tehran has been working on fuel combinations, but it apparently has not been successful.  The fact that Iran has not succeeded in this area is evident in Iran's effort to seek this technology from abroad.  33. (S) The U.S. noted that it was significant that both the U.S. and Russia assess that Iran is working on more-energetic propellants, even if the two sides differ in how far along they are.  Russia responded that this is due to the fact that Iran has not yet launched any longer range missiles.  There have been no tests, and statements from Iran that it has missiles that can fly 2,000 km have not been substantiated. The longest range that Russia has seen is 1,700 km, and that was achieved only because of a reduced throw weight.  If the U.S. has additional data to share, Russia would be interested.  The U.S. agreed to look into the matter and elaborate further at the next JTA talks.  34. (S) However, the U.S. also noted that modeling shows that achieving a greater range is possible.  Just because a capability has not been demonstrated operationally does not mean that it is not possible.  Once a program has achieved 1,500 km, going a few hundred kilometers more is not that much of an obstacle.  Going from 1,700 to 2,000 km is not a great technological stretch.  Russia said it could not agree because with a longer flight, various parts of the missile could burn through, the missile could fall apart, or it could go off course.  It needs to be tested at its maximum range. As discussed earlier, the U.S. believes Iran can achieve the increased range due to a combination of increased thrust from more powerful engines, a slightly reduced payload, and the use of aluminum instead of steel.  35. (S) Russia disagreed with the U.S. assessment that Iran has been able to buy technology to produce solid propellant engines.  Russia believes Iran continues to work on the technology to mix and pour the propellant.  This is a very difficult process.  Solid fuel has to be very evenly mixed to work properly.  It must be put into the motor case and then allowed to solidify, and the resulting fuel must be homogeneous.  In addition, fuel loading is more complicated for larger engines, and Iran has not mastered this.  Russia also believes Iran is experimenting with fuel composition, how long fuels can be preserved, and how temperatures can affect the mixture.  Russia does not think that Iran has solved the problem of thermal isolation of the engine from the airframe, as the junction with the engine tends to burn through.  Russia also does not think that Iran has solved the problem of thrust vector control and gas steering technologies.  The old technologies are not reliable, and Iran has had a hard time getting  components from abroad.  In addition, Iran cannot produce high-quality spherical aluminum powder and without this it cannot reliably produce solid fuel.  Russia noted that even Israel needs to buy ammonium perchlorate from abroad.  Iran has been trying to produce it indigenously, but Russia has no information indicating it has been successful.  In Russia's view, Iran appears to be having very serious problems with engine development.  36. (S) The Ashura  Russia said that in June 2008, it had received information from the State Department that within the framework of the Ashura program, Iran is producing a 3-stage missile called the Ghadr-110.  At that time, the U.S. told Russia that this missile is very similar to the Pakistani Shaheen-II and has a range of 2,000 km with a throw weight of one ton.  Testing of the Ghadr-110 may have started in 2008, and Russia would like additional information on this system.  The U.S. said that there appeared to be some confusion:  the Ashura is a two-stage solid propellant missile with a 2,000 km range, and the Ghadr-110 is the Fateh-110, a single-stage SRBM.  37. (S) Sejjil  Russia asked whether the Sejjil was part of the Ashura program.  The U.S. said it thinks the Sejjil is another name for the Ashura.  In addition, Iran also has a short range solid propellant system called the Fateh-110.  The experience gained from that program has been used in the development of the Ashura and helps explain how Iran acquired the capability to develop larger motors.  In the 1990s, Iran received production technology and infrastructure from China to develop solid propellants.  That infrastructure was used in the Fateh-110 and now is being used as the technological basis for the Ashura.  While the U.S. would agree that a larger solid propellant engine is challenging, Iran has over a decade of experience producing solid propellant motors and it got an important head start from China.  Independent of what Iran has since acquired, this head start allowed Iran to develop the Ashura, which has been flight tested successfully, and also to work toward longer-range systems. Russia did not fully agree, saying that the technology for an SRBM is quite different from medium and longer range systems.  38. (S) Iranian Challenges  Noting that Russia had mentioned several problems with Iran's efforts to develop larger motors, the U.S. asked for the basis of Russia's assessment and specifically whether it derived from the results of ground testing.  Russia responded that Iran is having problems generally because it did not develop the technology in Iran and is trying to work off of North Korean technology.  The U.S. then asked how Russia would explain the Ashura having been flight tested twice successfully. Russia said there is nothing special there as the technology is all old technology as described in detail in the literature of the Chinese Long March 4 engine.  The U.S. pointed out that the Long March is a liquid propellant system, and the Ashura is a solid propellant system.  If Iran has successful tests, it shows Iran has built MRBM rocket motors.  Russia countered that all it shows is that Iran is testing parts of the missile.  Iran may have claimed success but that is not the reality.  If Iran wants it to be reliable, the missile has to be tested many times before it can be deployed.  This is what Russia believes.  Russia understands the U.S. has a different point of view and this can be discussed again another time.  39. (S) North Korean Scuds  The U.S. said it seemed that both sides had a common evaluation of what types of short range systems North Korea possesses:  the Scud B, Scud C, and the new solid propellant MRBM.  Russia said that in 2008, the U.S. indicated that North Korean Scuds were launched at longer ranges.  Russia asked for any specific data on these missile launches and for U.S. thinking on why these systems are extended range Scuds and not Scud C missiles.  The U.S. said that it would try to provide more information on this issue at the next round of talks.  However, it is known that there have been at least two cases of North Korea helping other countries to develop Scuds with longer ranges than the Scud C.    One example is Libya.  When Libya gave up its MTCR-class missile programs in 2003, it showed the U.S. a missile it called the "Scud-C." However, it had a longer range than the missile we refer generally refer to as the Scud-C.  Additionally, many presentations in the MTCR Information Exchange have reported that North Korea is helping other countries, particularly Syria, develop a Scud with a longer range.  These presentations have referred to this longer range system as the Scud-D.  40. (S) No Dong  The U.S. thought that both sides had similar assessments of the No Dong.  Referring to the U.S. presentation from the previous JTA talks, Russia noted that the U.S. said there were seven launches of the No Dong in July 2009 by North Korea.  Russia has no information on such tests, and wondered if there U.S. had been referring to 2006.  The U.S. said that there had been tests of the No Dong just after July 4, 2009, and that there had been plenty of South Korean and Japanese reporting at that time.  Russia agreed there were July 4 missile launches, but of missiles with shorter ranges, not Scuds or No Dongs.  Given the confusion on this point, Russia urged that the issue be revisited during the next round of talks.  41. (S) UDMH  Russia asked whether the U.S. thinks North Korea is trying to develop a new engine that uses UDMH.  The U.S. said it believes this effort is connected with a new system North Korea is working on.  The U.S. thinks this new system is an IRBM.  42. (S) IRBM  Russia asked whether the U.S. has any specific data on this system.  The U.S. said it believes the system exists and has been sold to Iran as the BM-25.  43. (S) Taepo Dong  The U.S. agreed with Russia that the Taepo Dong-1 was a technology demonstrator that is no longer being used, and that the Taepo Dong-2 has had two tests that have been unsuccessful.  However, there is not agreement on the purpose of the Taepo Dong-2 system.  In tests, the intent has been billed as putting a satellite into orbit, but the U.S. also thinks it is very much intended as part of the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Russia noted for clarification that North Korea calls the Taepo Dong-2 the Unha-2.  44. (S) Russia believes the system has an engine with a 100 ton capacity that uses clustered designs based on old technology, and asked whether the U.S. thought the Taepo Dong-2 uses any new technology.  The U.S. responded that it has not seen any new technology associated with this system. Nevertheless, one path to acquiring a longer range system would be to cluster or stack engines for the new IRBM in the same way North Korea used Scud and No Dong engines in the Taepo Dong-2.  Russia pointed out that so far this has not been observed and there is no new technology associated with an ICBM in North Korea.  The U.S. agreed that no new technology has been observed in the ICBM, but it has been in the IRBM.  45. (S) Russia noted that in its presentations the U.S. had given a range of 10,000 km - 15,000 km with a 500 kg warhead for the Taepo Dong and asked how the U.S. had calculated this.  The U.S. said that for the 10,000 km range, it had assumed a clustered first stage and a No Dong second stage. For the 15,000 km range, it assumed a 3-stage configuration with the same clustered engines and second stage.  46. (S) Taepo Dong-2 and Military Applications  Russia pointed out that the Taepo Dong-2 would be hard to use for combat due to a lack of sites and its long launch preparation time.  The U.S. noted that North Korea could mitigate those problems by placing it in a silo or using it as a first strike weapon.  These would not be optimal approaches but if North Korea is sufficiently desperate, it would go with the systems available to it.  Moreover, North Korea puts great political value on these systems.  In the wake of the nuclear test and the UNSCR that followed, North Korea threatened to conduct an ICBM test.  This is another manifestation of the political value of this program for North Korea.  47. (S) North Korean Path to an ICBM  The U.S. said it saw three potential paths for North Korea to follow to obtain an ICBM: 1) use the Taepo Dong-2 as an ICBM; 2) further develop the technology for an IRBM based on their new MRBM, in the same way the No Dong was a path to the Taepo Dong; and 3) use the very large launch facility that is being constructed on the west coast of North Korea to launch a very large missile.  Russia said that the first two paths could be discussed at a later date.  48. (S) With regard to the third path, Russia wonders whether North Korea is building the new launch site to avoid launching over Japan and for safety reasons.  The U.S. responded that the size of the facility is of concern.  It does not simply replicate other sites.  This facility is much larger than the Taepo Dong launch facility.  This is not to say there is evidence of a new missile system larger than the Taepo Dong-2 being developed, but it suggests the possibility.  North Korea does not spend money on things unless they really matter.  Russia noted that North Korea does not have so much money, so it must economize.  However, Russia can probably agree that the new site is being built to test new missiles.  That said, Russia still thinks North Korea has problems developing more-powerful engines and accurate guidance systems.  This merits further observation and analysis.  49. (S) General Comments  Russia said it sees it as significant that Iran and North Korea are trying to buy more materials abroad and trying to get around existing export control regimes.  However, each country is different and Russia cannot say they are working according to the same principles.  On clustering, Russia has a different point of view than the U.S., but will look further into this.  Russia also has a different view on silos, but that can be discussed in more detail next time. In short, North Korea is complex and neither the U.S. nor Russia fully understands its capabilities.  Both sides need to monitor this carefully and work together on this issue.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- (U) Russian presentation of a framework for evaluating missile risks, dangers and threats; and discussion --------------------------------------------- -------------  50. (S) Nazarov said Russia believes any missile assessments should be based not only on modeling, but also on consideration of the real technical barriers faced by Iran. Serious attention must be given to these technical problems. Otherwise, we will use erroneous assumptions to evaluate the problem.  For example, we can count the number of centrifuges, multiply by production capabilities, and say Iran can produce enough uranium for several warheads. However, this would not be correct because the models do not take into account the technical difficulties in cascade technologies that Iran has not worked out yet.  51. (S) In the same way, Russia thinks that when talking about the Shahab-3, there is no possibility of Iran using these missiles in a launch silo configuration.  Also, Russia does not see Iran increasing the throw weight or range to the declared capabilities.  Thus, as regards attempting to draft a joint report, Russia foresees no problems in an evaluation of the basic systems, but does foresee a difference in the evaluations of the technical barriers faced by the Iranians. With regard to timeframes, Nazarov said that if we talk about real threats, and not just potential challenges, then we need to think about all the systems that need to be developed and tested.  To facilitate this, Russia thinks the JTA discussions should be divided into discussions on missile risks and missile threats.  The two sides should agree on what these are and then work to prevent missile risks from growing into missile threats.  52. (S) Nazarov then asked Vladimir Yermakov, Director for Strategic Capabilities Policy, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to introduce Russia's proposed methodology for evaluating missile risks and missile threats.  Yermakov said Russia views the December JTA talks as the first step in implementing the goals of the July 2009 Presidential Joint Statement.  These consultations build on many years of work with the U.S. on missile defense, including missile threat assessment, and Russia would like to underscore that the dialogue and close collaboration on missile defense is due to the positive decisions taken by the new administration on missile defense.  Russia's official assessment of Obama's missile defense policy is that it is a step in a positive direction.  Russia commends the U.S. decision to drop the fielding of missile defense elements in Poland and the Czech Republic and replace it with a multi-phased program for missile defense in Europe.  Russia will only be able to give its assessment of the new  project after it has seen the implementation of the first phase.  Further collaboration in missile defense will depend on how the project will be developed on the U.S. side.  But a key part of our collaboration will be the joint assessment of missile threats.  53. (S) Continuing, Yermakov said Russia believes that any further practical cooperation on missile defense will be based on a concrete joint assessment of the missile threats. The U.S. and Russia need to have a clear understanding of whom we are cooperating against and we need to make clear distinctions between missile risks, missile challenges, and missile threats.  Russian and U.S. perceptions may coincide and may differ, that is understandable.  We can work together to address threats we both agree on.  But there may be threats the U.S. sees as real and Russia sees only to be perceived ones, and vice versa.  In such cases, the extent of our cooperation may be less or lower, but we can still do something jointly to address these threats as well.  54. (S) Yermakov said that Russia sees as an end-goal of the JTA consultations a document outlining jointly assessed missile threats and challenges.  Naturally, in working on such a document, the U.S. and Russia will recognize that their views differ and those differences will have to be reflected in this document.  We can take as an example our record of cooperation within the NATO Russia Council (NRC).  55. (S) Yermakov then distributed a paper on a framework of criteria for assessing the level of risk of a given missile program.  He explained that the material on the first page is a graph presented in simplified form in which Russia presents two categories - a threat and a challenge.  In order for there to be a threat, it is necessary to have two components:  intention and capabilities.  Only when both components are present does a threat become real.  From the Russian point of view, lack of either component makes the threat hypothetical.  When both components are lacking, the threat is only "perceived," and the threat of a nuclear missile strike is zero.  56. (S) Yermakov noted that on the second page, Russia suggests four categories:  missile challenge, missile danger, missile threat, and missile strike.  Russia views a missile challenge as an aspiration to obtain capabilities in the field of rocketry to fulfill one's legitimate national goals.  These goals can be a space program or missiles as weapons. A missile danger emerges when nations envision in national guidelines a doctrine that they could/could use missiles.  A missile threat is a more advanced category in which a country has the intention to use its missile capability to further its national military and political goals.  A missile strike is self evident.  Yermakov urged the U.S to review the paper and, at a later stage, provide an assessment of this approach.  At that point, the two sides can compare views, theoretical approaches and assessments of threats, and use this framework to develop a joint document of challenges, risks, and threats.  57. (S) Nazarov thanked Yermakov for his presentation, saying that he believed the U.S. and Russia needed to continue their joint work based on a shared methodology.  The methodology proposed in the Yermakov presentation will allow us to address challenges and threats concretely, and to overcome differences of opinion.  Nazarov said he did not see U.S. and Russian differences as significant for a joint document and thought they could be overcome.  In this context, Russia has prepared  a memorandum with respect to drafting a joint assessment.  The essence of the paper is that the two sides would work together to draft a document on a joint understanding of the problems of missile proliferation.  It would be an assessment of the current trends, conditions, and factors that make up today's situation, and appropriate conclusions.  58.  Nazarov suggested the two sides agree on a timeframe for drafting the document, which would lay the foundation for cooperation and make it more dynamic.  Russia thinks the JTA work could finish by the end of 2010 and believes that following this round, the group could come up with a draft report and then work to improve it and flesh out some of its provisions.  Based on the principle of rotation, Russia also thinks the next round of JTA talks should be in March or April, 2010 in Moscow.  Finally, given the sensitive nature of the eventual final document, it should be treated as confidential and only made available to third parties with the consent of both our parties.  (Passed over non-paper.)  59. (S) Van Diepen appreciated the thought put into the Russian document and the invitation to Moscow, which he accepted.  He said the U.S. would study the paper and provide comments at a later date.  This will lay the groundwork for productive meetings in Moscow.  However, he also cautioned that the two sides must be careful not to let process get in the way of substance.  He said the U.S. and Russia need to share assessments first and then think about what to do with them.  He also said the two sides should identify the differences in our assessments and the reasons for those differences, rather than get bogged down in wordsmithing and nuances.  60. (C) Nazarov said Russia shares the opinion that the JTA study has a practical goal.  He said Russia is serious about the problem of future missile threats and that the JTA work is under the close scrutiny of the President of the Russian Federation, who demands that the Russia side give an impartial and objective assessment.  Russia believes there is a danger in over- or underestimating the threat as it could prod us to move in the wrong direction.  When it comes to missile and nuclear threats, errors in estimation in both directions are dangerous.  61. (S) Yuriy Korolev, an expert from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explained that during a meeting in Budapest in February 2008, Russian experts presented a collection of interesting approaches on assessing missile proliferation threats.  Using that document, Russia thought one could give a more unbiased assessment of missile threats.  However, there has been no reaction from the U.S.  This may be due to the fact that only limited numbers of the document were distributed and they did not reach all appropriate senior U.S. officials.  Russia continues to believe this document is interesting and would appreciate U.S. views, analysis, comments, and proposals on how to make our efforts on countering missile proliferation more effective.  Russia's view is that the methodology presented would make assessments of missile threats more impartial (handed over copies).  --------------------------------------------- ------------- (U) Russian presentation on the security threat presented by instability and Islamists in Pakistan and discussion --------------------------------------------- -------------  62. (S) Korolev noted that while the focus of the discussions had been on the missile threats from North Korea and Iran, Russia did not think discussion should be limited to only those threats from Iran and North Korea.  In the Russian view, there is another serious threat that should be discussed: Pakistan.  Pakistan is a nation with nuclear weapons, various delivery systems, and a domestic situation that is highly unstable.  Russia assesses that Islamists are not only seeking power in Pakistan but are also trying to get their hands on nuclear materials.  Russia is aware that Pakistani authorities, with help from the U.S., have created a well-structured system of security for protecting nuclear facilities, which includes physical protection.  However, there are 120,000-130,000 people directly involved in Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs, working in these facilities and protecting them.  However, regardless of the clearance process for these people, there is no way to guarantee that all are 100% loyal and reliable.  63. (S) In addition to the Islamist interest in these facilities, Russia also is aware that Pakistan has had to hire people to protect nuclear facilities that have especially strict religious beliefs, and recently the general educational and cultural levels in Pakistan has been falling.  Due to these facts, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear and missile programs.  Over the last few years extremists have attacked vehicles that carry staff to and from these facilities.  Some were killed and a number were abducted and there has been no trace seen of them.  Also, even if places are well protected, transportation of materials is a vulnerable point.  In Pakistan, it is hard to guarantee the security of these materials during transportation.  For these reasons, Russia thinks Pakistan should also be a particular focus of JTA discussion.  64. (S) Nazarov clarified that Russia believes the focus of the JTA discussions should be the missile programs of Iran and North Korea.  Russia assumes the nuclear and missile programs of Pakistan are regionally oriented and thus outside the scope of the current JTA discussion.  However, Russia recently hosted a delegation led by Senators Hagel and Harkin.  The Senators told a meeting of the Russian Security Council that Pakistan poses the greatest threat to the world.  Therefore, Russia would appreciate any additional information the U.S. can provide on the actual situation with regard to the protection, storage, and transportation of nuclear and missile weaponry in Pakistan.  65. (C) Van Diepen appreciated Russia's concern with Pakistan and interest in getting further information but noted that the issue as described is primarily nuclear materials being acquired by terrorists, it is more of a nuclear issue and less related to ballistic missiles.  He undertook to report back and facilitate a response from the appropriate office outside the context of the JTA.  66. (S) Nazarov said Russia is interested in using all channels to cooperate with the U.S. on this subject.  First and foremost, Russia is talking about the threat of nuclear terrorism.  If the scenarios include future development, the threat of missile technology getting into the hands of terrorists should also be considered.  Russia would like to put its concern on the record, and particularly with regard to the possibility of Islamists coming to power in Pakistan. Russia would appreciate the U.S. providing additional information on the subject - perhaps at the follow-up meeting in Moscow.  67. (C) Van Diepen said he would report Russia's concerns but noted that the U.S. response would likely come through diplomatic channels rather than at our April/March meetings. He also urged that Nazarov raise his concerns with Special Advisor Holbrooke or his Deputy.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- (U) Russian presentation on FSB work to interdict Iranian and North Korean attempts to buy restricted technology, or to transship third party materials through Russia --------------------------------------------- -------------  68.  (C) Anatoliy Raikevich, First Deputy Department Director, Federal Security Service (FSB), said that both Iran and North Korea appear to depend heavily on illegally obtaining equipment and technology from abroad for missile and WMD programs.  The FSB has information that Iran and North Korea both have programs to try to acquire Russian technology.  One of the basic tasks of the FSB is to prevent them from acquiring WMD-related production technology in Russia.  To do this, the FSB takes action based on Russian law and export controls.  In particular, the FSB monitors and takes measures to prevent WMD technology exports.  This includes criminal investigations of attempts to export contraband and items on the prohibited list.  Russian analysis shows that that these efforts have significantly reduced the achievements of the Iranian security services in this area.  However, the Iranians continue to try to use the territory of Russia for transits and reexports of such materials.  69. (C) A key effort of the Iranian services is the company to company approach, whereby they use fake companies run by the Iranian security service to procure Russian goods.  The FSB has set up sting companies to uncover Iranian activities.  In the past two years, the FSB has cut off a good deal of the exports of such technology.  70. (C) The FSB has determined that Iran is trying to get equipment such as measuring devices, high precision amplifiers, pressure indicators, various composite materials, and technology to create new missile engines from Russia and from sources in Western Europe.  To produce these items itself, Iran would need to seriously modernize its technological base.  To combat this, the FSB must cooperate with the U.S. and European security services.  Russia has many years experience cooperating with U.S. security services and has moved from information exchanges to operational activities.   The FSB thinks U.S. services are very professional and well prepared, and hopes cooperation will continue.  71. (C) Van Diepen thanked Raikevich for his presentation, noting that he had had lots of experience during the 1990s working with Russian counterparts on the problem and trying to reduce the success of Iran in acquiring missile technology.  Van Diepen said he was impressed by the people in Russia working on export controls and appreciated that Russia recognized that Iran is still trying to acquire technology from Russia.  He said he would pass on to U.S. security services the FSB's interest in continued cooperation.  He added that the U.S. would want to work with Russia in those channels as well as in diplomatic channels as the need arose to address specific shipments of concern.  72. (S) Raikevich replied that discussing these issues with the U.S. will help Iran and North Korea to "boil in their own oil."  He said Iran and North Korean may have small successes here and there with procurement, but the FSB will see to it that their successes remain small.  The FSB is grateful for information the U.S. passes along regarding various Russian organizations that may be working with Iran or North Korea, and wants continue to work together to prevent the spread of this technology from Russia and other countries.  ---------------------- (U) Concluding remarks ----------------------  73. (S) Yermakov said that Russia thought the discussions had been productive and cooperative.  He noted that both sides have significant homework assignments to complete before the next round and can test the results at the end of March/beginning of April.  He then offered concluding remarks on behalf of the Deputy Secretary of Russia's National Security Council: -- With regard to Iran, Russia believes the possibility of improvement of its liquid propellant missiles is nil.  --It is impossible from the Russian point of view for Iran to put a nuclear device on existing missiles with an improved range and throw weight.  --Iran has no ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons at this time, and Russia sees no threat from missiles in Iran.  --In Russia's view, Iran presents a missile challenge.  --A missile threat would only develop if Iran seceded from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and successfully developed an MRBM with a 3,000 km range and a warhead of one ton.  --Iran does not have the military-industrial capability to develop such a program.  If Iran could gain access to foreign technology, it might develop such a program but this is unlikely due to export controls.  --In any case, even with the assistance of foreign technology, Russia assesses it will take Iran 6-8 years to gain the ability to launch an MRBM with a nuclear warhead.  --With regard to an ICBM, Russia considers this purely hypothetical and does not see the possibility of Iran having this capability for the next 10 years.  --For North Korea, Russia assesses that its only real capabilities are outdated missiles with ranges of no more than 3,500 km.  --While it is possible to develop missiles with greater ranges based on an SLV program, that would take many years, even with a successful program.  74. (C) Yermakov said these were the basic conclusions Russia wanted to make.  If the conclusions are agreeable to the U.S. side this could be noted.  If not, they can be discussed again at a later date and will be the basis for future work, to continue successful bilateral cooperation.  He said Russia is not at all concerned about differences regarding various aspects of these programs.  Russia sees this as natural. Having differences just means that we need to meet more often and exchange information through appropriate channels. Russia looks forward to a U.S. interagency delegation coming to Moscow.  Until then the two sides can communicate through diplomatic channels or even just by telephone.  75. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russia side, especially Nazarov, for its thorough preparation and professionalism. He said the U.S. was pleased with the interagency character of the Russian delegation and appreciated that Russia had given a lot of thought to both conceptual issues and technical matters.  The challenge going forward - as shown in the contrast between the technical discussions and Russia's concluding remarks - will be to come to a greater shared understanding of the issues.  On the technical side, there is a fair amount of agreement, but as we go up in range, our views diverge.  Based on common data, we have different perceptions.   The conclusions the U.S. would draw would be different in each case from the conclusions Yermakov outlined.  That is not bad, but both sides need to work to understand the conceptual and technical basis for these views.  There is a great deal to discuss, and we will need to be well prepared for fruitful and informative discussions in Moscow in the spring.  The U.S. will study the Russian papers and follow up through diplomatic channels.  The U.S. also will do its homework assignments, propose specific dates for the next round of talks, and be prepared for "our exams" next time in Moscow.  --------------------- (U) Participants ---------------------  76.

S E C R E T STATE 008675  NOFORN SIPDIS EMBASSY MUSCAT FOR EXBS ADVISOR TYLER HOFFMAN  E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2020 TAGS: ENRG ETTC KNNP PARM OTR TCSUBJECT: EXBS: DOE/INECP REPORTING CABLE FOR COMMODITY IDENTIFICATION TRAINING, DUBAI, 10-13 JAN 2010  Classified By: Jerry Guilbert for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (U) The Department of Energy,s (DOE) International Nonproliferation Export Control Program (INECP), through funding provided by the Department of State,s Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) Program, conducted Commodity Identification Training (CIT) for Dubai Customs, Jan 10 ) 13, 2010.  CIT teaches customs agents to recognize WMD-related dual-use items, and this event marked the first time INECP had delivered any type of training in the Unite Arab Emirates (UAE).  2. (U) The INECP team consisted of Chris Walker (DOE HQ); Heidi Mahy and Kevin Whattam (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory); Basil Picologlou (Argonne National Laboratory); and Kirk Walker (Kansas City Plant).  Lisa Meyers (DOS/Office of Counterproliferation Initiatives) and Tyler Hoffmann (EXBS Advisor for the Middle East) also attended.  The Dubai office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided organizational support and attended the course.  3. (U) The course began with brief overviews of Weapons and Mass Destruction and delivery systems (missiles), which occupied most of the workshop,s first day.  The remaining three days consisted of about three dozen modules covering a range of controlled goods, including machine tools, gyroscopes, (precursor) chemicals, and many others.  The course also featured several practical exercises and  to test the participants, grasp of the material. Unsurprisingly, the attendees were not particularly lively during the overview presentations, but they showed strong interest in the commodity presentations and especially the exercises.  Dubai Customs brought an x-ray van to the course, allowing both instructors and participants to see how some controlled goods (that is, the ones INECP brought along as teaching aids) look when x-rayed, probably the part of the course that generated the most interest and excitement.  This was the first time any Customs agency had provided an X-ray van at a CIT seminar.  4. (U) Attendance on the part of Dubai Customs varied from about 15 participants on the first day to around 20 or so for most of Days 2 through 4, plus a few individuals from the training division responsible for organizing the event.  Most of the attendees work in Port Rashid, but there were also attendees from the Jebel Ali, Cargo Village, UAE-Oman border crossing, and two  representatives from Dubai Customs, WMD division.  Mr. Mohammed Foolad, the Dubai Custom,s Manager for Non-proliferation of WMD, was the senior-most person in attendance and had a good working knowledge about WMD related dual-use items from his work.  He leads a special unit of five individuals (one of whom attended the course with him). He  requested extra copies of the printed course materials and electronic versions of all the Arab-language materials, which the team provided to him.  5. (U) Overall, the level of interest was quite good.  The audience was fairly participatory, and showed a great deal of energy in particular while x-raying the goods and during a wrap-up exercise, in which groups of participants identify pictures of goods from the course.  Multiple participants stated that cooperation should continue in the future; time will tell if the sentiment was genuine.  6. (S)  In a side conversation between Mr. Foolad and Ms. Meyers, he noted that his job is to coordinate WMD- related cases.  He works closely with the Dubai General Directorate of State Security on sensitive issues.  When asked about the Export Control office, he noted that he works with them, but that they are new to this issue, while Dubai Customs has been working on this issue for years.  He noted that the UAE was developing a computer system that will allow Emirate- level customs offices to communicate with each other.  7. (S//NF) CONTD: On targeting, Mr. Foolad noted that Dubai Customs is stopping WMD related cargo on their own (without information from foreign governments) using their targeting methods.  They currently use the control lists of the various regimes to target controlled goods, as well as information provided by the United States, Germany, and others to target end users.  They have a handbook created by Dubai Customs to help their officers physically identify WMD related dual-use goods, but noted they have had difficulty finding pictures of certain Wassenaar military- related items.  He described a case of glass fiber stopped on its way from the Netherlands to Iran, as well as some 7075 aluminum.  He noted that they really need more information on who the suspect end users are, as they could use this information to help them better target WMD end users.  He mentioned that they routinely find that the same phone numbers are associated with different companies. 8.  (S//NF) CONTD: Mr. Foolad explained the serious problems they are facing at their Cargo Village facility, which is where they handle air cargo shipments.  He noted that they have to look at over 9,000 shipments a month going to one country of concern (i.e., Iran).  He noted how difficult this is due to the quick time frame, but how necessary given the sensitivity.  NOTE:  Mr. Foolad seemed to take the course, and moreover his responsibilities leading the WMD unit, very seriously. 9.

Feltman for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  REF A: STATE 120288  1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 2-5.  SUMMARY -------  2.  (C) The United States, along with its partners, has made an unprecedented effort to engage Iran in an effort to diplomatically resolve the international community's concerns with Iran's nuclear program.  Iran's lack of constructive response so far, and its continued reluctance to cooperate with international efforts to build confidence and transparency in its nuclear program, demand a response.  Department requests posts to draw on the attached narrative to explain our rationale for why  sharpening the choice that Iran faces, by increasing pressure, is necessary at this point, and to secure the cooperation of host governments in these efforts.  End Summary.   OBJECTIVES ----------  3.  (C) FOR ALL POSTS (except Moscow, Paris, Beijing, London and Berlin): Please draw on narrative beginning in paragraph 11 to:  -- Highlight U.S. efforts to mobilize diplomatic engagement with Iran in 2009;  -- Underscore the lack of a meaningful Iranian response to those efforts, especially since the P5+1 political directors meeting with Iran in Geneva on October 1, 2009;  -- Outline U.S. view of next steps, including increasing pressure on Iran; and  -- Seek enhanced bilateral cooperation to increase pressure.  4.  (C) FOR MOSCOW, PARIS, BEIJING, LONDON, AND BERLIN: Posts may share the general tenor of our message but do not need to deploy the points themselves with host governments.  5.  (C) Points should be deployed by Ambassadors to most appropriate senior counterparts.  Posts may not leave any part of this message in writing with host governments.  DEADLINE --------  6.  (U) Posts should report any substantive response to their efforts by February 3.  Elisa Catalano (NEA/FO, catalanoe@state.sgov.gov, 647-9533) and Richard Nephew (ISN/RA, nephewrm@state.sgov.gov, 647-7680) are the Department's POCs.  BACKGROUND ----------  7.  (SBU) With its P5+1 partners, the U.S. has been pursuing a policy towards Iran that includes engagement  STATE 00009124  002 OF 006   and incentives, as well as pressure.  Since the 1 October 2009 meeting of the P5+1 Political Directors and representatives from Iran, the United States has been working closely with its partners to engage with Iran to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  Based on the agreement in principle reached with Iran in Geneva, we have focused on supporting the IAEA's proposal for refueling the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), facilitating the IAEA's investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Qom, and pressing for a follow-on meeting between P5+1 Political Directors and Iranian representatives explicitly on Iran's nuclear program.  8.  (C) The results since October 1 have been disappointing.  Iran has not accepted the IAEA's TRR proposal; instead, Iran has rejected a series of updated and more flexible proposals from the IAEA and our partners on some terms of the proposal (REF A), and has offered a substantially different counterproposal which fails to address the concerns about its nuclear program, does not fulfill the objective of building confidence in Iran's nuclear intentions, and, as EU High Representative Lady Ashton described, in effect rejects the IAEA's proposal.  Iran has also announced its intent to expand its nuclear program, including its intention to start enriching uranium to higher levels to make its own TRR fuel if its terms are not accepted on the fuel deal.  Although Iran granted IAEA access to the facility at Qom, its cooperation was limited and there remain serious questions about Iran's intentions for the facility, which is in open defiance of five UN Security Council resolutions.  Finally, Iran to date has gone back on its earlier commitment to meet again with the P5+1 to discuss its nuclear program.  9.  (SBU) Former IAEA Director General El-Baradei released his latest report on Iran on November 16, 2009, and the IAEA Board of Governors (BoG) adopted a resolution on Iran on November 27, 2009.  The resolution notes the Board of Governors' serious concern that Iran continues to defy the requirements and obligations contained in UNSC resolutions and IAEA resolutions.  The Board of Governors also expressed its serious concern that contrary to the request of the Board of Governors and requirements of the UN Security Council, Iran has neither implemented the Additional Protocol nor provided the access necessary for the IAEA to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities.  10.  (U) President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and other P5+1 leaders identified the end of 2009 as a key period for assessing Iran's responsiveness.  While the offer of engagement remains on the table, we have begun to work with partners to prepare new measures to increase pressure on Iran.  DIPLOMATIC POLICY NARRATIVE ---------------------------  11.  (U)  Begin talking points:  Overview: Where We've Been, and Where We Are --------------------------------------------  -- The President made clear his readiness to open a new page in our relations with Iran, based on mutual respect. This new approach featured our offer to engage Iran directly, as well as our readiness to become a full and active participant in the P5+1's efforts to resolve international concerns about Iran's nuclear program through negotiations.  -- We stated clearly our support for Iran's right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy provided Iran meets its  STATE 00009124  003 OF 006   international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the NPT framework.  -- When we met with the Iranian delegation in Geneva on October 1, along with our P5+1 partners, we sought Iran's commitment to three concrete actions, which would demonstrate its intentions for its nuclear program:  --  support the IAEA's proposal for refueling the Tehran Research Reactor;  --  facilitate the IAEA's full investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Qom;  --  agree to a follow-on meeting between P5+1 Political Directors and Iranian representatives by the end of October, explicitly focused on nuclear issues but also open to discussion of any issues raised by any party. -- Each of these agreed actions presented Iran with an important opportunity to begin to assure the international community about its intentions for its nuclear program and to pursue together a diplomatic resolution to our differences.  -- Iran has not followed through on any of these three commitments.  -- President Obama also stated last year that we would continually assess Iran's responsiveness to these offers, and that the end of the year would present a key period of assessment.  -- It is increasingly clear that Iran has not taken advantage of the opportunities we have offered.  -- A year into the Obama administration, Iran has not taken practical, concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions.  Iran:  --  Continues to enrich uranium despite UNSC requirements that it suspend such operations;  --  Revealed it had been building a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near Qom, in violation of its safeguards agreement and UN Security Council resolutions;  --  Continues to refuse cooperation with the IAEA in addressing the full range of IAEA questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program;  --  Has not accepted the IAEA proposal to refuel the TRR, which was a response to an Iranian request, despite U.S. and our partners' significant efforts to be flexible and address Iranian concerns with the deal; and  --  Since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany in Geneva on October 1, has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program.  --  Iran has not been able to say "yes" to a balanced IAEA proposal that would provide fuel for its Tehran Research Reactor and begin to build mutual trust and confidence, notably by transferring 1,200kgs of its low enriched uranium abroad as an indication of Iran's peaceful nuclear intent.  --  Underscoring the significance of the IAEA's TRR proposal, in November 2009, former IAEA DG ElBaradei said that the proposal had "extensive built-in guarantees...the Russians are guaranteeing implementation.  STATE 00009124  004 OF 006   The Americans are ready for the first time to guarantee the implementation.  The [IAEA] will take custody of Iran's material so the international community as a whole will guarantee" implementation.  --  On Iran's desire to retain possession of its nuclear material under delivery of the fuel (which is the basis of Iran's counterproposal), Dr. ElBaradei rejected this approach, saying publicly in November after Iran first raised this idea that this would "defeat the whole purpose of the IAEA's agreement...this is not a solution.";  --  While it allowed IAEA inspectors to visit its newly revealed enrichment site near Qom, it did not provide the IAEA with the full access the organization requested, notably by agreeing to the IAEA's request for access to specific Iranian nuclear officials and answering IAEA questions regarding the history and purpose of the facility.  The clandestine construction of this facility was inconsistent with Iran's IAEA Safeguards Agreement, and is in open defiance of UN Security Council resolutions.  --  As the IAEA reported in November 2009, Iran continues to develop its nuclear program regardless of international concerns and IAEA, NPT, and UNSC requirements - most starkly in its construction of a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near Qom.  As former Director General El-Baradei's report on November 16 outlines, this facility and the circumstances surrounding it raises the persistent question of additional such undeclared facilities.  --  The IAEA report makes clear that Iran has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the IAEA, answering questions about the use of this facility and the possibility of other facilities.  --  Iran has failed to take advantage of the creative TRR proposal, engage with us constructively on other elements of its nuclear program, and cooperate fully with the IAEA.  It also still defies UNSC requirements that it suspend its enrichment program, instead announcing an expansion of its nuclear program.  Even more, it is threatening to begin enriching its LEU to higher levels of enrichment if the international community does not accept a TRR deal on its terms, terms that would not build confidence as they would reduce and delay transfers of LEU from Iran.  --  Iran's continued nuclear activities and its refusal to engage meaningfully with the international community risks a possible arms race in the region and undermines the global international nonproliferation regime as a whole.  --  As you know, Israel has stated that an Iran with nuclear weapons poses a great threat to its security and that it reserves the right to defend itself.  We believe Iran's continued non-compliance with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program poses serious threats to stability in the region.  Presenting Iran with a united global front is the best avenue to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic means.  --  In addition to its disregard of its nuclear-related obligations, Iran continues to support terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, and militant groups in Iraq.  It also provides some support to the Taliban to facilitate attacks against ISAF forces in Afghanistan.  --  Also of deep concern to the international community is the dramatic uptick in repression inside Iran.  As Secretary Clinton said recently, we are deeply disturbed  STATE 00009124  005 OF 006   by the ruthless repression that Iran is exercising against its citizens who seek to exercise their universal right to free expression and assembly.  The Pressure Aspect of the Strategy: Making the Case --------------------------------------------- -------  --  The two elements of the P5+1 strategy - engagement/incentives and pressure -- were always intended to run in parallel, because without a credible threat of consequences, it is unlikely that Iran will make a strategic or even tactical change in direction.  --  For that reason, we have always recognized the possibility that we would need to increase pressure to sharpen the choice that Iran faces in order to persuade Iran that the international community is serious.  --  Still, our emphasis over the course of this year has been on outreach and engagement rather than pressure. Unfortunately, to date, Iran has failed to respond constructively.  --  Pressure is not an end in itself; it is a means to encourage Iran to recalculate costs and benefits, and to return to a course of constructive engagement at the negotiating table.  But without unmistakable and meaningful consequences, there seems little prospect for such a return.  --  The international community has already imposed strict measures on Iran via various multilateral fora to demonstrate that Iran cannot ignore its responsibilities without cost.  We believe a more aggressive enforcement of this existing and robust international framework, along with the application of significant additional pressure, will illustrate to Iran the sharp choices it faces should it continue to rebuff efforts to resolve our differences diplomatically.  --  Unity among members of the international community is absolutely essential to demonstrate to Iran that there are serious consequences for its continued refusal to engage constructively with the international community over its nuclear program.  Such unity was clear when the IAEA Board of Governors adopted its Iran resolution in November. It was also clear in the European Council's declaration on Iran issued in December.  Both were useful and immediate opportunities to increase pressure on Iran.  --  We believe Iran's continued non-compliance regarding its nuclear program deserves the full and urgent attention of the international community.  Next Steps ----------  -- We stand behind our offer to engage with Iran, but we are rapidly approaching the moment when we will have to give full meaning to all elements of our strategy.  We, along with our partners, believe that the time has come to increase pressure on Iran.  Such pressure is necessary to uphold the integrity of the UNSC and IAEA, and demonstrate that continued non-compliance has consequences.  -- The U.S. believes that multilateral pressure would be best achieved through new UN Security Council action and swift implementation of that action.  -- However, UN action alone may not be sufficient to persuade Iran to change course.  There is much more that can and should be done immediately to implement measures already required under the existing international sanctions framework.  We therefore ask our partners to  STATE 00009124  006 OF 006   ensure that we are collectively enforcing all those measures that are already in place as comprehensively as possible.  -- We regret that Iran has missed repeated opportunities for meaningful engagement.  Our intent is not to escalate a conflict, but to press for a diplomatic resolution.  Inaction is what the Iranians are hoping for, as they draw closer to achieving a nuclear weapons capability.  -- On January 16, we and our P5+1 partners met to take stock and discuss next steps regarding Iran.  As the Chair's statement reflects, we agreed that Iran has failed to follow up on the key understandings reached in our meeting with the Iranian delegation on October 1, 2009.  We are united and remain committed to our approach - while we will continue to seek a negotiated diplomatic solution, we believe it is time for consideration of appropriate further measures.  -- We are here today to intensify our consultations with you, as one of our partners in the international community, on next appropriate steps aimed to persuade Iran to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations.  -- We urge these steps with steady determination that we must do everything we can, including applying greater pressure, to encourage Iran to return to a constructive course of engagement.  FOR EU MEMBER STATES, USEU, AND TOKYO ONLY:  -- As we move ahead with and beyond the UN process, we also will want to work with you to agree on additional actions we could take on a coordinated, national basis to magnify the impact of a new Security Council Resolution and demonstrate to Iran our seriousness of purpose.

(S) Background/Objective: The U.S. has information indicating that in December 2009, the Chinese company Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. offered to sell gyroscopes produced by a Russian company to Iran's Isfahan Optics Industries.  Our information indicates that these gyroscopes could be delivered to Iran in early February 2010 and that Isfahan Optics Industries was coordinating this transaction through an intermediary named Iran Business (IBco).  Because key missile development organizations in Iran previously have attempted to procure similar gyroscopes, we are concerned this equipment potentially could be diverted to missile-related end-users.  We therefore want to alert Chinese officials to this information and ask that they investigate this activity with a view to preventing Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. from facilitating missile-related exports to Iran.  3.  (S) Action Request:  Request Embassy Beijing approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper.  4.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:  (SECRET//REL CHINA)  --We would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your government's assistance in investigating this activity.  --The U.S. has information indicating that in December 2009, Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd., a Chinese company based in Futian, China, had offered to sell Iran's Isfahan Optics Industries gyroscopes produced by a Russian company.  --Our information indicates that these gyroscopes could be delivered to Iran in early February 2010 and that Isfahan Optics Industries was coordinating this transaction through an intermediary named Iran Business (IBco).  --We are bringing this matter to your attention to support your export control efforts as we are concerned this equipment potentially could be diverted to missile-related end-users in Iran.  --We understand that the Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO), which is responsible for overseeing all of Iran's missile programs, has previously attempted to procure similar gyroscopes.  --We hope you will use this information to investigate this activity and take all appropriate measures to ensure that Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. is not facilitating unauthorized exports of missile technology to Iran.  --We believe taking such action would be consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 and 1803, which require countries to prevent transfers of items to and from Iran that could contribute to the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems.  --We look forward to continued cooperation on missile nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information.

AZIMI RECALLED THAT GOI HAD REQUESTED DELIVERY OF 16 OF F-4E AIRCRAFT NOW ON ORDER BY IRAN (FIRST OF WHICH WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY UNTIL AUGUST 1973) BE ADVANCED TO CY 1972. HOWEVER, GOI HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED BY USG AND MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS THAT PRODUCTION LINE FOR IRAN COULD NOT RPT NOT BE ADVANCED TO MEET 1972 DELIVERY DATES DESIRED. SHAH WAS MOST DISTURBED, AS ADDITION OF F-4ES IN 1972 WAS VITAL TO IRAN'S SECURITY AT THIS TIME. SHAH HAD DIRECTED THAT USG BE ASKED, IF PRODUCTION FOR IRAN COULD NOT IN FACT BE ADVANCED, TO MAKE REQUESTED F-4ES AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. SHAH'S DESIRE IS FOR DELIIVERY OF F-4FS IN LOTS OF FOUR DURING JUNE TO DECEMBER TIME-FRAME.  3. CHARGE REVIEWED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN US-IRAN MILITARY COOPERATION, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND CREDIT, AND STRESSED THAT RECORD INDICATED WE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED SHAH'S CONCERNS AND DESIRES AND HAD BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO SHAH'S WISHES. CURRENTLY, AZIMI'S DEPUTY GEN. TOUFANS, WAS IN US DISCUSSING VERY QUESTION OF ACCLERATED EQUIPMENT ACQUISIION INCLUDING F-4E. ACCELERATION OF F-4E DELIVERY RAISED DIFFICULT TECHNICAL AND COST PROBLEMS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS OF OTHER COMMITMENTS AND PRIORITIES. UNDOUBTEDLY THESE ISSUES WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN FULL WITH GEN. TOUFANIAN TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY INFORMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS AND REASONS FOR ANY LIMITATIONS ON MEETING GOI REQUEST THAT MIGHT EXIST. GEN. TOUFANIAN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FULLER PICTURE OF SITUATION THAN WE NOW HAD IN IRAN.  4. AZIMI RESPONDED THAT GOI WAS BEING KEPT INFORMED OF TOUFANIAN DISCUSSIONS, BUT DECISON ON F-4E COULD NOT BE DELAYED. AZIMI MADE CLEAR SHAH FELT AQUISITION OF 16 F-4E AIRCRAFT IN 1972 WAS MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE MILITARY PROBLEM OUTSTANDING. HE STRESSED SHAH BELIEVED THAT NUMBER REQUIRED WAS SMALL IN RELATION TO US INVENTORY, AND THAT UNSETTLED SITUATION CONFRONTING IRAN WARRANTED ACCELERATED DELIVERY TO IRAN AS AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE DISPOSITIONS (AS TO EUROPE OR EVEN USAF) IN SAME TIME FRAME.  5. CHARGE NOTED WE WOULD TRANSMIT SHAHS REQUEST TO, WASHINGTON AND THAT USG IN SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MARKED OUR RELATIONS WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE RESPONSIVE. CHARGE SAID THIS SAME FRIENDSHIP REQUIRED HIM TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET SHAH'S NEEDS AS SHAH SAW THEM, OUR MILITARY ADVISERS, AS GOI KNEW, WERE CONCERNED THAT ACCELERATION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION WOULD STRAIN SUPPORT AND OPERATIONAL MANPOWER OF IIAF AND COULD LEAD TO DECREASE RATHER THAN INCREASE IN IIAF EFFECTIVENESS. AZIMI REPLIED THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED HAD BEEN, CLOSELY STUDIED BY IlAF WITH MAAG ASSISTANCE, AND IIAF WAS SATISFIED THAT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT REQUESTED COULD BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO PRESENT FORCE STRUCTURE. AZIMI CLOSED MEETING BY ASKING THAT USG ANSWER SHAH'S REQUEST AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.  6. COMMENT. SHAH IS DEEPLY CONCERN AT DEVELOPMENTS OVER PAST YEARS STRENGTHENING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN MIDEAST AND INDIAN OCEAN AND APPEARING TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIALLY ENLARGED SOVIET COMMITMENT, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY, TO IRAQ. HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASED PRESENT DANGER REQIRES IRAN'S FIRST LINE AIR DEFENSE TO BE BEEFED-UP NOW RATHER THAN IN PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED SCHEDULE STARTING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE NUMBER, FREQUENCY AND TONE OF DEMARCHES ON SUBJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS VIRTUALLY UNPARALLELLED, AND CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HIM CONSIDERS ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.  7. WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH SHAH'S CONCERN, WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT REQUEST --LIKE USG DECISION IN 1970 ON SALE TO IRAN OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SQUADRONS OF F-4E --HAS BECOME ANOTHER GUT ISSUE IN SHAH'S MIND. SHAH IS AGAIN TURNING TO USG BECAUSE IN PERIODS OF ANXIETY SHAH FEELS HE CAN LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND HE HOPES THAT US AS RELIABLE FRIEND WILL FIND CHANCE BE RESPONSIVE ON MATTER HE CONSIDERS IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO IRAN'S SECURITY. THUS USG CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DECISION INVOLVES UNUSUAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE RELATED TO FABRIC OF USG-GOI RELATIONS. DECISION SHOULD ALSO NOT OVERLOOK OR UNDERESTIMATE IMPORTANCE OF IRAN FOR VITAL US NATIONAL INTERESTS.  8. ACTION REQUESTED. COUNRY TEAM URGES THAT USG GIVE PROMPT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION TO SHAH'S REQUEST FOR 1972 DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT, FROM WHATEVER SOURCES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED (INCLUDING DELIVERIES TO USAF). WE RECOGNIZE THAT REQUEST MAY RAISE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, BUT URGE THAT EVERY AVENUE BE EXPLORED TO REACH POSITIVE RESPONSE. IT IS ALSO MOST IMPORTANT THAT COUNTRY TEAM BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS TO ENABLE US CONTINUE TO MEET AND TEMPER SENSE OF URGENCY ON SUBJECT WHICH PREVAILS WITHIN GOI. IF DELAYS OR BARRIERS TO FULLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE MATERIALIZE, WE TRUST THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE (E.G. PARTIAL DELIVERY IN 1972) AND THAT PERSUASIVE RATIONALE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO SHAH REASONS FOR ANY SHORTCOMING. IN ORDER TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT.  HECK
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEHRAN 08980  E.O. 12065: GDS 8/12/85 (TOMSETH, VICTOR L.) OR-P TAGS: PEPR IRSUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS  1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT).  2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION.  3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION.  4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED "BAZAAR MENTALITY" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH GTE.  5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE'S OWN ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK.  6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN IN PLACE. "BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY WOULD GO BY MONDAY," HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS "90 PERCENT SOLVED," BUT WHEN A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY ACTION AND RESULTS.  6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY?  7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS:  - --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER.  - --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT LEAST TO THE LATTER.  - --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS.  - --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING.  - --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL'S SAKE IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED ON BOTH SIDES.  - --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN NEGOTIATOR'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL (FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

S E C R E T MADRID 05480  E.O. 12356: DECL:  OADR TAGS: PTER PINR PREL SP LYSUBJECT:  QADHAFI RETALIATES AGAINST SPANISH EXPULSIONS  REF:  A) MADRID 5426, B) MADRID 5425, C) MADRID 5418  1.  (C) LIBYA MAY 12 RESPONDED TO FRIDAY'S EXPULSION OF ITS CONSUL GENERAL, CHARGED WITH PASSING FUNDS TO A SPANISH ARMY COLONEL ON THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC RIGHT, BY PNG'ING THE SPANISH COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL COUNSELORS IN TRIPOLI.  MFA'S SUBDIRECTOR GENERAL FOR NORTH AFRICA TELLS US THAT THE GOS WILL NOT RETALIATE SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE EXPULSIONS; AS INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE INTO THE LIBYAN ACTIVITIES HERE, HOWEVER, MORE EXPULSIONS ARE QUITE POSSIBLE.  2.  (U) AFTER THIS MESSAGE WAS DRAFTED, WE RECEIVED A WIRE SERVICE REPORT QUOTING INTERIOR MINISTER BARRIONUEVO SAYING THAT SPAIN DID NOT PLAN ADDITIONAL LIBYAN EXPULSIONS.  3.  (C) COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS SERIES OF EXPULSIONS AND REPRISALS IS GOING TO TAKE SPANISH- LIBYAN RELATIONS.  THE GOS IS DRIVEN BY TWO MUTUALLY- EXCLUSIVE DESIRES.  ON THE ONE HAND, IN THIS ELECTORAL PERIOD IT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE FAR RIGHT (WHICH IT HAS DONE BY PUBLICIZING THE COLONEL'S CONNECTION TO QADHAFI - REF C), AND SHOW IT IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST TERRORISM (WHICH IT DID BY BAGGING THE 10-MAN "CALL OF JESUS CHRIST" GROUP - REF A).  AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS WANTS TO AVOID BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TARGET FOR QADHAFI BY PERSERVING AS MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP AS POSSIBLE.  FOREIGN MINISTER ORDONEZ     PLAYED  TO THE SECOND LINE THIS WEEKEND WHEN HE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES HERE, SAYING "I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT WHICH MIGHT AGGRAVATE A STATE OF RELATIONS WHICH IS PASSING THROUGH A DELICATE MOMENT."  WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR MFA SOURCE THAT SENIOR MINISTRY OFFICIALS MET TODAY TO DECIDE HOW TO REACT TO LIBYA'S RETALIATION (WHICH LEAVES THE GOS EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI WITH ONLY 3 DIPLOMATS).  THE DECISION TO DO NOTHING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MINISTRY'S LINE -- TAKEN PUBLICLY THIS WEEKEND -- THAT IT DOES NOT WANT TO SEVER RELATIONS WITH TRIPOLI.  THIS STRATEGY IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF QADHAFI PLAYS ALONG.   ENDERS
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 PANAMA 08545 E.O.12356: DECL:OADR TAGS: PGOV PREL PM USSUBJECT: PANAMANIANS HOPE FOR A SUCCESSFUL COUP -- NORIEGA PLANS FOR A NEW YEAR IN POWER 1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. -------------------------------- SUMMARY -------------------------------- 2. THROUGHOUT 1989, RAPIDLY UNFOLDING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS HELD OUT HOPE TO MANY PANAMANIANS FOR A RESOLUTION TO PANAMAS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS: THE ELECTION OF MAY 7, THE SUBSEQUENT OAS NEGOTIATIONS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF SEPTEMBER 1, THE COUP ATTEMPT OF OCTOBER 3, AND THE TREATY DEADLINE OF JANUARY 1, 1990. PROJECTING INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 1990, NO SUCH HOPEFUL EVENTS AND DATES ARE READILY APPARENT. THE OPPOSITIONS MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SURVIVE POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND LITERALLY UNTIL THE NEXT COUP. NORIEGA WILL HAVE TO TRY AND CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL OVER THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES (FDP) AND AVOID ANOTHER UPRISING. 3. PRESSURES ON NORIEGA HAVE INCREASED ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE DETERMINED THAT HE CAN MANAGE THEM. DESPITE NEW U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, THE MOST PRECIPITOUS ECONOMIC DROP IS OVER FOR NOW, FOLLOWING A TWO-YEAR, 25 PERCENT DROP IN GDP. INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION REMAINS AN IRRITANT TO THE REGIME, BUT IT IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR NORIEGAS STABILITY. U.S. ACTIONS, FROM THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CANAL ADMINISTRATOR TO RUMORED COVERT PLANS AGAINST NORIEGA AS WELL AS NEW ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, ALLOW NORIEGA TO BEAT THE NATIONALISTIC DRUM AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR HIM IS GROWING. 4. NORIEGAS WEAKEST POINT REMAINS HIS OWN INSTITUTION. WHISPERS THAT THE OCTOBER 3 COUP IS NOT OVER CONTINUE AND NORIEGA CONTINUES TO HOLD ON MAINLY BY BRUTAL REPRESSION OF ANY POTENTIAL NEW INSIDE OPPONENTS. WHEN ANOTHER ACTION TO REMOVE NORIEGA WILL TAKE PLACE IS UNCERTAIN, BUT WAITING FOR THAT POSSIBILITY IS THE MAIN PROSPECT FOR PANAMA IN 1990. END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------- THE CRISIS GRINDS ON --------------------------------------- 5. THE PANAMA CRISIS CONTINUES TO GRIND ON WITH NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT. NORIEGA TENACIOUSLY HOLDS ON TO POWER, INTIMIDATING HIS OPPONENTS AND FIRING UP HIS SUPPORTERS WITH SLOGANS CALLING FOR RETRIBUTION AGAINST PANAMANIAN TRAITORS AND THEIR U.S. MASTERS, SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM. NORIEGA IS WEAKER THAN HE WAS AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT SET OF PRESSURES HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO EJECT HIM FROM OFFICE. 6. NEVERTHELESS, RECENT PRESS REPORTS OF AN ALLEGED U.S. COVERT ACTION PLAN AGAINST NORIEGA HAVE ONCE AGAIN RAISED HOPES OF SOME PANAMANIANS THAT THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF HIS END. NORIEGA HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY ATTACHING SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE PRESS REPORTS. HE HAS REACTED NERVOUSLY BY STEPPING UP HARASSMENT OF THE OPPOSITION AND INCREASING THE SIZE, TRAINING, ACTIVITY, AND ARMAMENT OF HIS DIGNITY BATTALIONS. THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP IS CONCERNED OVER THE NEW EYE FOR AN EYE PARA-MILITARY CAMPAIGN, WHICH NORIEGA HAS USED TO REMIND THE OPPOSITION OF ITS VULNERABILITY. --------------------------------------- REGIME POLITICAL ACTIVITY --------------------------------------- 7. THE RODRIGUEZ ADMINISTRATION, UNSURPRISINGLY, REMAINS INEFFECTUAL, BUT CONTINUES TO LIMP ALONG. REGIME SOURCES INDICATE WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTITUDE THAT NORIEGA IS UNHAPPY WITH HIS CIVILIAN PUPPETS, THAT HE MAY EVEN FIRE RODRIGUEZ, AND PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE FORMAL REIGNS OF GOVERNMENT SOON. THE ASSEMBLY OF 510 LOCAL DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES (ANRC) CONFIRMED HIM AS NATIONAL COORDINATOR ON NOVEMBER 22. THIS BRINGS HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING NAMED HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH HE AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE HINTED AT FOR SOME TIME. 8. MANY VIEW THIS NORIEGA MOVE AS THE FINAL STEP TOWARD A TOTALITARIAN REGIME AND FURTHER SEVERE REPRESSION. SOME SEE THIS AS A PENDING NORIEGA MISTAKE. AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, HE WOULD HAVE TO BEAR FULL OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIME ACTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, BY INTRODUCING A NEW ELEMENT -- HIS GOVERNMENTAL ROLE -- INTO THE STALE POLITICAL SITUATION, NORIEGA MAY BE ABLE TO USE HIS USUAL MIXTURE OF OBFUSCATION AND INTIMIDATION TO BUY HIMSELF MORE TIME AND POLITICAL BREATHING SPACE. ------------------------------------------ THE OPPOSITION ------------------------------------------ 9. NORIEGAS MOST RECENT PARA-MILITARY SHOW OF FORCE FURTHER CONVINCED THE OPPOSITION THAT POLITICAL ACTION WILL RESULT ONLY IN GREATER REGIME BRUTALITY AGAINST THEM, NOT NORIEGAS DEPARTURE. THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP QUIETLY HOPES THAT CLANDESTINE (AND OTHER) U.S. ACTION, POSSIBLY COUPLED WITH ANOTHER COUP WILL REMOVE NORIEGA. THE LEADERS SEE THEMSELVES PLAYING A ROLE IN THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT AND THEIR CURRENT PREPARATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN TO FILL THE GOVERNMENT VACUUM IF THE NEXT EFFORT SHOULD SUCCEED. THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION RECOGNIZES THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT THE MILITARY IS THE MAIN POLITICAL FORCE IN PANAMA. 10. AS THE MEMORY -- AND TO SOME EXTENT THE LEGITIMACY -- OF THE MAY ELECTION RECEDES, THE PRESSURE ON THE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE OPPOSITION RANKS TO DO SOMETHING TO MAINTAIN POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IS GROWING, HOWEVER. OPPOSITION ABILITY TO CULTIVATE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND TRUST IN THE ADOC LEADERSHIP ARE HAMPERED BY EFFECTIVE NORIEGA INTIMIDATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL. MEANWHILE, U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE CONTINUING TO HURT AND NEW MEASURES ARE UNPOPULAR. THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP FEARS THAT MANY PANAMANIANS -- INCLUDING THEIR FOLLOWERS -- WILL INCREASINGLY DEMAND THAT THE AMERICANS GET OFF THEIR BACKS, IF NORIEGA WONT. 11. PANAMAS OPPOSITION AND PANAMANIANS IN GENERAL RAN UP MANY SHORT TERM HILLS IN 1989 - WITH THE END ALWAYS JUST OVER THE HORIZON. MAY ELECTIONS, THE OAS NEGOTIATIONS, SEPTEMBER 1, OCTOBER 3, AND NOW JANUARY 1, 1990 HAVE ALL TOO EASILY BEEN ACCEPTED AS TARGETS FOR WHEN THE PANAMA CRISIS WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLVED. ALREADY ADOC LEADER GUILLERMO BILLY FORD IS TALKING OF FEBRUARY 25 (NICARAGUAN ELECTION DAY) AS A DATE BEFORE WHICH NORIEGA MUST FALL IF THE U.S. DOES NOT WISH TO HAVE THE PRECEDENT OF AN ANNULLED ELECTION REPEATED IN NICARAGUA . OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITION HAS LITTLE ENERGY LEFT TO CHARGE UP ANOTHER HILL UNLESS CONVINCED IT IS THE LAST ONE. ONLY ANOTHER COUP HOLDS OUT SUCH A PROMISE, BUT THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABLE TO INFLUENCE THAT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. --------------------------------------- THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT --------------------------------------- 12. THE MOST (AND MAYBE ONLY) HOPEFUL SIGN FOR NORIEGAS OPPONENTS IN 1990 IS THAT TROUBLES INSIDE THE FDP ARE WORSE THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. REASSIGNMENTS AND PROMOTIONS FLOWING FROM THE POST-COUP PURGE ARE JUST NOW BEING MADE -- MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EVENT. MANY OF THE MORE PROFESSIONAL FDP OFFICERS AND NCOS WERE KILLED, TORTURED, OR DISMISSED AFTER OCTOBER 3. THE SUCCESSOR CROP OF TRUE BELIEVERS HAS NEITHER THE EXPERIENCE, TRAINING OR INTELLIGENCE TO FILL THE SHOES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS. NORIEGA HAS HAD TO RELY MAINLY ON HIMSELF OR THE SUPPORT OF THIS SMALL CLIQUE OF LOYALISTS SINCE THE COUP ATTEMPT. HIS INCREASED USE OF DIGNITY BATTALIONS IS ALSO WEARING ON THE CAREER SOLDIERS. WHAT LITTLE MILITARY PRIDE THEY HAVE LEFT HAS BEEN INJURED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS PARA-MILITARY RABBLE WHICH THEY FEAR WILL GET OUT OF CONTROL AND ULTIMATELY HURT THE INSTITUTION. WITH THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS AND OTHER IRREGULARS OVER 2000 IN NUMBER THE IMAGE OF A COMPETING PARA-MILITARY FORCE IS BEGINNING TO ARISE. 13. DISCONTENT AND FEELINGS OF REVENGE CONTINUE TO FESTER INSIDE THE FDP AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PREPARED TO ACT ON THESE EMOTIONS. ONE REGIME INSIDER RECENTLY CLAIMED THAT NORIEGAS NOMINAL NUMBER 2, COLONEL MARCO JUSTINES, IS HIMSELF LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCH OUT HIS BOSS. MEANWHILE, NOTORIOUS CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF NORIEGA, SUCH AS XXXXXXXXXXXXXX(STRICTLY PROTECT), ARE ALREADY LOOKING BEYOND NORIEGAS DEPARTURE IN ADVOCATING WITH EMBOFFS AN OPPOSITION DECLARATION OF AMNESTY FOR REGIME SUPPORTERS. SOURCES NOW INDICATE THAT NORIEGA SUSPECTS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO UNSEAT HIM AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 15. ------------------------------------------ THE STATUS OF UNRELENTING PRESSURES ------------------------------------------ INTERNATIONAL ------------- 14. THE RECENT RESOLUTION OF THE OASGA CONFIRMED NORIEGAS ISOLATION IN THE HEMISPHERE, BUT WAS MET WITH ONLY FLEETING INTEREST IN PANAMA. THE FDPS DISINVITATION TO THE RECENT CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN ARMIES IN GUATEMALA WAS POTENTIALLY A MORE SERIOUS BLOW TO FDP MORALE, BUT THIS COLD SHOULDER FROM THEIR LATIN COLLEAGUES PASSED LARGELY UNNOTICED BECAUSE OF NORIEGAS ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF INFORMATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE HIS INSTITUTION. 15. AMBASSADORS OF MOST NATIONS REMAIN OUTSIDE PANAMA, EITHER ON VACATION OR CONSULTATIONS, BUT LOCAL DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION MAY BE IN DANGER. THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY RETURNED FROM HIS VACATION TO REJOIN HIS ITALIAN AND SPANISH COLLEAGUES WHO NEVER LEFT. SEVERAL AMBASSADORS AND MILITARY ATTACHES (E.G. MEXICO) MAY VISIT THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ARE RESIDING HERE AT CHRISTMAS. NORIEGA IS MAKING ALL HE CAN OUT OF CONTACTS WITH THE USSR, THE PRC, LIBYA, CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND EVEN U.S. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT GROUPS. HE WILL ALSO SEEK TO CONJURE UP SOME LIMITED LEGITIMACY IN HIS PLEA FOR LATIN SOLIDARITY OVER THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR ISSUE. ECONOMIC -------- 16. THE REGIME CONTINUES TO HAVE CASH FLOW PROBLEMS, BUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAS LEVELED OFF FOR NOW. NORIEGA IS ABLE TO COMBAT THE WORST DISRUPTIONS BY SALARY ADJUSTMENTS AND CONTINUED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF LOYALISTS. UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS ON THE RISE, BUT ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THE PANAMANIAN SERVICE ECONOMY -- THE COLON FREE ZONE -- IS HAVING RECORD SALES AND PROVIDES SOMEWHAT INCREASING EMPLOYMENT IN THE POLITICALLY VOLATILE COLON AREA. 17. MEANWHILE, PARA-MILITARY DIGNITY BATTALIONS ARE ENLISTING OR SCARING THE UNEMPLOYED. BUSINESSMEN, HURT BY NORIEGA AND U.S. SANCTIONS, ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO MOVE TOWARD ACCOMMODATION WITH NORIEGA. MANY FEEL THEY HAVE TO GIVE PRIORITY TO BEING ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. U.S. PRESSURES -------------- 18. FURTHER U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS HEIGHTEN THE SENSE OF CRISIS IN PANAMA, CREATING THE PARADOX OF REGIME-OPPOSITION-CHURCH AGREEMENT IN OPPOSING THEM. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE U.S. PORT BAN FOR PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS AND THE APPOINTMENT OF A TEMPORARY CANAL ADMINISTRATOR CREATE NEW PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORIEGA. BANNING PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS FROM THE U.S. WILL ROB NORIEGA AND HIS CRONIES OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INCOME. SOME OF THE LATTER MAY EVEN JUMP SHIP AND TURN ON HIM. BUT IN THE END RESULT, MANY MORE MAY REALIZE THAT IT WAS THEY WHO DEPENDED ON HIM, NOT HE ON THEM. 19. THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTMENT OFFERS NORIEGA SOME ADDITIONAL NATIONALISTIC PEGS TO SUPPORT HIS SEARCH FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. BLOWING THE TREATY VIOLATION AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WHISTLE MAY WELL GAIN HIM SOME SUPPORT. PLAYED WELL, HE MAY AGAIN BE ABLE TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST: BUY TIME. --------------------------------------------- THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CRISIS --------------------------------------------- 20. DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPPOSITION TO NORIEGA IS SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE. FOREIGN ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR IS DISTRACTED BY MUCH HIGHER PROFILE REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, FROM EL SALVADOR TO BERLIN. OF COURSE, NORIEGA TOO IS TIRING, EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SLOWNESS IN SETTLING THE TURMOIL INSIDE HIS OWN INSTITUTION. BUT HE IS A MASTER OF SURVIVAL AND ABLE TO BUILD ON THE FATIGUE OF OTHERS. RENEWED NOISES IN RECENT REGIME PRONOUNCEMENTS OF A WILLINGNESS TO TALK ARE A CLASSIC MANIFESTATION OF TRIED AND TRUE NORIEGA TIME-BUYING TACTICS. 21. THE POLITICAL TENSION IN PANAMA, INCREASED BY RECENT PRESS REVELATIONS AND U.S. SANCTIONS ANNOUNCEMENTS, WILL LIKELY EBB IN EARLY 1990, ABSENT SOME MAJOR EVENT. NORIEGA IS SHOWING NO SIGNS THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF LEAVING VOLUNTARILY. GIVEN BROAD POLITICAL REALITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, THE ONLY HOPE FOR A FIRST STEP IN CRISIS RESOLUTION IS ANOTHER COUP. WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IS THE MAIN POLITICAL PROSPECT FOR PANAMA IN 1990. BUSHNELL

ATTORNEY ESSA MOOSA WHO SPOKE WITH HIM LAST WEEK, SAYS MANDELA FULLY EXPECTS THAT ON FEBRUARY 2 DE KLERK WILL ANNOUNCE THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE CONFIDENTIAL  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 02        CAPE T  00097  01 OF 03  182017Z  RELEASE OF SEVERAL POLITICAL PRISONERS INCLUDING MANDELA HIMSELF.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD COME SWIFTLY AFTER DE KLERK'S SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT. - 3.  THE SAG IS CONCERNED OVER ANC RELATIONS WITH THE SACP AND OVER THE WORKING DEFINITION OF "ONE MAN ONE VOTE," AMONG OTHER "WHITE FEARS" ISSUES.  MANDELA HAS PASSED DE KLERK'S "PROPOSALS" ON THESE TOPICS TO THE ANC. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS REMAIN IN PLACE MAY BE PART OF THE ANC'S REPLY TO THE SAG.  4.  TENSIONS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY THE SAG'S TACTIC OF OPENING DIALOGUE AND A COMMITMENT SHARED BY THE MDM TO REDUCE CONFRONTATIONS. WHILE MAINLY OF BENEFIT TO THE SAG, THIS PERIOD OF CALM COULD ALSO FAVOR THE ANC'S NEW STRATEGY OF PRAGMATISM.  5.  RAISING THE PENDING VISIT OF JESSE JACKSON, MOOSA EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE STRUGGLE IF JACKSON ADVOCATED LIFTING SANCTIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO THE US.  END SUMMARY. - 6.  IN A HALF HOUR CONVERSATION WITH POLECONOFF. ESSA MOOSA. THE WESTERN CAPE UDF'S LAWYER AND ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO MET WITH MANDELA LAST WEEK, MADE THE F0LLOW- ING REMARKS:  --------------------------------------------- ------------- MANDELA RELEASE WILL BE ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 2 IN PARLIAMENT --------------------------------------------- ------------- 7.  MANDELA MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HE FULLY EXPECTS CONFIDENTIAL  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 03        CAPE T  00097  01 OF 03  182017Z  PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK TO MAKE SEVERAL MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS IN HIS FEBRUARY 2 SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT. DE KLERK WILL ANNOUNCE:  -- THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER POLITICAL -  ORGANIZATIONS;  -- THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY;  -- THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA;  -- THE RELEASE OF A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, -  INCLUDING NELSON MANDELA. - 8.  THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL THE ITEMS LISTED WILL TAKE EFFECT AS OF THE TIME OF THE SPEECH.  BUT FIRM PLANS AND A COMMITMENT TO CARRY THEM OUT SWIFTLY WILL BE PART OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  ------------------------------- WHERE WILL MANDELA BE RELEASED? ------------------------------- 9.  MOOSA SIDESTEPPED A QUESTION ABOUT WHERE MANDELA'S HOME BASE WOULD BE UPON HIS RELEASE.  HE ONLY REMARKED THAT MANDELA CAN TELL THE SAG WHERE HE WANTS TO BE RELEASED AND WHERE HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE WOULD THUS TAKE PLACE.  SENTIMENTALLY, SAID MOOSA, PAARL (WHERE MANDELA IS NOW IN PRISON) SEEMED TO APPEAL TO MANDELA. (COMMENT:  BUT POLITICALLY AND PRACTICALLY THIS MAKES LITTLE SENSE.  JOHANNESBURG SEEMS BY FAR THE MOST SUITABLE VENUE.

WHEN HE MET SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WITH MANDELA, DE KLERK PROVIDED A SET OF PROPOSALS AND ASKED FOR THE ANC'S RESPONSE.  MANDELA HAS NOT DISCUSSED THOSE PROPOSALS IN ANY DETAIL WITH PEOPLE HERE (AT LEAST HE DID NOT DO SO WITH THE LAWYERS' GROUP OF WHICH MOOSA WAS A MEMBER) BUT HE DID TRANSMIT THEM TO ALFRED NZO AND THABO MBEKI. MOOSA BELIEVES (PIECING TOGETHER STRAY REMARKS WHERE AND THERE) THAT THE PROPOSALS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO THE NEED TO ALLAY WHITE FEARS.  SPECIFICALLY, HE THINKS ONE ISSUE WAS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ANC TO THE SACP (SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNIST PARTY) AND ANOTHER WAS THE DEFINITION OF ONE MAN ONE VOTE.  11.  ASIDE FROM BEING AN EFFORT TO SEIZE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND BY PUBLICLY DEMONSTRATING FLEXIBILITY, THE ANC'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS LIKE THE GROUP AREAS ACT REMAIN IN PLACE MAY BE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION'S REPLY TO DE KLERK.  12.  MOOSA UNDERSTANDS MANDELA TO HAVE WORKED OUT A GAME PLAN FOR "NEXT STEPS" IN A NEGOTIATION WITH DE KLERK SO AS TO ENSURE THAT HE IS NOT RELEASED FROM PRISON INTO A VACUUM.  13.  MANDELA HAS TOLD VARIOUS VISITORS THAT HE HAS A GOOD OPINION OF DE KLERK AS A SINCERE INDIVIDUAL EVEN THOUGH HE REGARDS HIM AS STILL THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY AND NOT MORE THAN THAT.  --------------------------------------------- --------- COMMITMENT ON SAG AND MDM SIDE TO REDUCE CONFRONTATION --------------------------------------------- ---------  14.  MOOSA AGREED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH LESS TENSE THAN EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR THE RETURN TO SCHOOL RESULTED IN THE USUAL ACCUSATIONS AND PHYSICAL CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING (DET), AIDED BY THE POLICE, AND STUDENTS SUPPORTED BY PARENTS, TEACHERS AND THE MDM. THIS YEAR THERE IS AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS DUE TO LACK OF SPACE IN BLACK SCHOOLS AND THE FAILURE OF OVER 100,000 STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR "MATRIC EXAMS." YET THERE IS A NEW SPIRIT OF DIALOGUE AT THE DET AND ACTIVISTS ARE THEREFORE ABLE TO CHANNEL STUDENT FRUSTRATIONS IN A CON- STRUCTIVE MANNER.  15.  THE SAG'S NEW "TACTIC" OF ALLOWING DISSENT AND ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF STONEWALLING "IS WORKING FOR THEM," MOOSA SAID.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT IT COULD ALSO, IF DEALT WITH POSITIVELY, WORK FOR THE MDM AND ANC.  THOUGH AN ABSENCE OF DIRECT CONFRONTATION IS "DEMOBILIZING FOR THE MASSES," FEWER RAW NERVES AMONG ACTIVISTS COULD MAKE THEM MORE AMENABLE TO THE ANC'S INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE SAG. THAT STRATEGY, MOOSA SAID, IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY MANY ACTIVISTS, ESPECIALLY YOUTH, WHO FEAR A SELL-OUT OF THEIR CAUSE.  THERE REMAINS A LOT TO DO TO EXPLAIN THE VIRTUES OF FLEXIBILITY TO THEM.  -------------------------------- PAC AND BC -- A THORN IN THE SIDE --------------------------------  16.  MOOSA DESCRIBED THE CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC FUTURE AS "NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN COOPERATION." HE OPINED THAT THE PAC AND BC COULD TURN OUT TO BE A REAL PROBLEM.  HE EXPECTS THEM TO REMAIN ALOOF, SNIPING AT THE ANC'S POSITIONS FROM THE SIDELINES AND STIRRING UP YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR.  ---------------------- JESSE JACKSON VISIT ----------------------  17.  MOOSA INQUIRED ABOUT THE DATES FOR JESSE JACKSON'S VISIT AND EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT JACKSON HAD MET WITH THE PRESS AT SOUTH AFRICAN AMBASSADOR KOORNHOF'S RESIDENCE.  MOOSA FEARED THAT THE SAG WAS GOING TOO GOOD A JOB OF CULTIVATING JACKSON AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN TO THE US AND ANNOUNCE THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LIFTED. MOOSA APPEARED TO HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN KOORNHOF'S PERSUASIVE ABILITY THAN IN THAT OF THE SACC LEADERSHIP WHICH IS HOSTING THE JACKSON VISIT.  BAQUET
