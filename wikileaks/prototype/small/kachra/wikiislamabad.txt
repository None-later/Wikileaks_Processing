C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 08251  E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR TAGS:  PREL, IR, PK, SU SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN SEES SIGNS OF UPTURN IN IRAN-SOVIET -         TIES  1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. - 2.  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY NAIK SUMMARIZED HIS AMBASSADOR'S APPRAISAL OF UPTURN IN IRAN-SOVIET TIES. THE AMBASSADOR ASSERTS IRANIAN RATIONALE IS BASICALLY PRAGMATIC AND ASSERTS TREND WILL CONTINUE. END SUMMARY.  3.  RESPONDING TO MY EARLIER REQUEST FOR GOP THINKING ON THE MEANING OF THE APRIL 5 VISIT TO MOSCOW OF IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HOSSEIN ARDEBILI, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY APRIL 19 SUMMARIZED FOR POLCOUNSELOR AND ME A CABLE JUST RECEIVED.  WE SHOULD PROTECT THE SOURCE COMPLETELY.  THE SIGNS OF AN UPTURN ---------------------- 4.  EARLY IN 1984, THE GOI HAD INDICATED ITS INTENTION TO TRY THE TUDEH PARTY LEADERS, SENT LOW LEVEL OFFICIALS TO THE SOVIET REVOLUTIONARY DAY CELEBRATIONS, AND LIMITED SOVIET DIPLOMATS' CONTACTS.  ALL THIS LEFT THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN VOICING GLOOMY AND NEGATIVE PROGNOSIS FOR RELATIONS. - 5.  THE SOVIET PATIENCE NOW SEEMS TO BE BEARING FRUIT AS:  -- THE IRANIANS POSTPONED THE TUDEH TRIALS (IN NOVEMBER);  -- RAFSANJANI ATTENDED AND SPOKE PROFUSELY AT THE 10-DAY DAWN(SIC) CELEBRATION; AND  -- THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS STARTED TO CAST THE SOVIETS IN A MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT. MOST RECENTLY A PROMINENT COLUMNIST QUESTIONED THE GOVERNMENT'S RATIONALE FOR NOT HAVING CONSULTED WITH THE SOVIETS DURING RECENT DIPLOMATIC DEMARCHES MADE WHEN THE WAR INTENSIFIED (WHY NOT INCLUDE THE NUMBER ONE SUPERPOWER--OUR STRONG NEIGHBOR?). - WHAT IRAN WANTS --------------- 6.  IN CONTEXT OF AN INCREASINGLY COSTLY WAR, THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDES IRAN SEEKS:  -- TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, E.G., WITH POSSIBILITY OF GAS SALES TO THE SOVIETS;  -- SECURE LINES OF COMMUNICATION--THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TURKISH LOC; AND  -- ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE AIR ROUTES--THE IRAQI THREAT HAS CUT MOST OF IRAN AIR'S WESTWARD SERVICE, AND THE SOVIETS HAVE OFFERED A NEW ROUTE TO FRANKFURT VIA MOSCOW.  7.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES A NUMBER OF TANGIBLE INDICATORS ALREADY REFLECTING BENEFITS OF INCREASED ECONOMIC COOPERATION:  -- THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING BUILD POWER GENERATORS, AND SEEKING TO EXPAND THIS AREA OF COOPERATION.  -- TWO-WAY TRADE IN 1985 SHOULD EXCEED $2 BILLION.  -- A JOINT MINISTERIAL MEETING WILL BE HELD IN MAY-JUNE, AND EXPERTS WILL MEET IN MOSCOW IN MAY TO LOOK AT OTHER STEPS FOR ENHANCING ECONOMIC RELATIONS. - ARDEBILI VISIT -------------- 8.  PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SURMISES THE SOVIETS WILL HAVE REITERATED OPPOSITION TO THE WAR'S CONTINUATION. HE BELIEVES THE IRANIAN SIDE LIKELY ONLY LISTENED.  THE IRANIANS WOULD HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOVIET ARMS SUPPLIES TO IRAQ--WHETHER SOVIETS TAKE NOTE WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON SOVIET PERCEPTIONS OF IRAN'S POST-WAR INTENTIONS.  THE SOVIETS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SEE IRAN TOO STRONG.  9.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES THESE CURRENT MOVES AS A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE.  IRAN FEELS INCREASINGLY ISOLATED.  ITS REMAINING ARAB SUPPORTERS, E.G., SYRIA AND LIBYA, ARE SOVIET FRIENDS.  AMBASSADOR ASSERTS MANY IRANIANS WOULD PREFER BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., BUT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY TIDE IS STILL FLOWING TOO STRONG, THE U.S. IS NOT READY FOR SUCH MOVES, AND IN ANY CASE IS TOO DISTANT.  RUSSIA ON THE OTHER HAND IS A POWERFUL NEIGHBOR WHICH CAN DO IMMEDIATE GOOD OR EVIL. - 10.  NAIK, EXTENDING THE POINT MADE ABOUT THE U.S., NOTED THAT THE IRANIAN DELEGATION AT THE RECENT ECONOMIC COOPERATION ORGANIZATION (ECO) COMMITTEE MEETINGS HAD EXPANDED THE CONSENSUS TO GET TECHNICAL COOPERATION (IF NECESSARY) FROM "WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES."  PAKISTAN AND TURKEY HAD INITIALLY PROMOTED THE IDEA OF "REST OF THE WORLD" OUT OF CONCERN THAT IRAN WOULD BALK AT A GROUPING THAT INCLUDED THE U.S.-- INSTEAD THE IRANIANS EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR THE WESTERN COUNTRIES FORMULATION.  11.  COMMENT:  NO DOUBT THE GOP IS WATCHING THESE DEVELOPMENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.  THEY UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM BUT WOULD WELCOME U.S. MOVES TO EASE IRAN'S ISOLATION.  SHORT OF THAT THEY HOPE WE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE AS THEY WORK TO HELP KEEP IRAN FROM FALLING UNDER SUBSTANTIAL SOVIET SWAY WITH ALL THAT WOULD MEAN FOR PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.  CERTAINLY THE LONG-TERM RISKS FOR OUR INTERESTS DEMAND WE TAKE SUCH AN ATTITUDE.  HINTON 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 01587  E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PK SUBJECT: KHAMENEI'S VISIT: RESURGENCE OF SHIA EXTREMISM?  1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  2. SUMMARY: THE SUCCESSFUL (FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE) VISIT OF KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BOOSTED THE MORALE OF THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS HERE. APPARENTLY FLUSH WITH NEW FUNDS, THE SHIAS HAVE BEGUN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY OVER LIBYA. SUCH CAUSES EVOKE LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY, AND THE ATTITUDES OF THE SUNNI MAJORITY -- MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK UPON ANY SIGNS OF SHIA ASSERTIVENESS WITH SUSPICION AND DISTASTE -- WILL CONTINUE TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE RADICAL SHIAS TO PURSUE SPECIFICALLY SECTARIAN GOALS. HOWEVER, SHIA EXTREMISTS WILL DOUBTLESS SEEK TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FANNING ANTI-AMERICANISM AMONG THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. A HEATING UP OF THE AL QUDS EPISODE WOULD TURN ALL GROUPS AGAINST US.  END SUMMARY.  THE KHAMENEI VISIT  2. ONE WORRISOME ASPECT OF THE RECENT VISIT OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE APPARENT NEW LEASE ON LIFE IT HAS GIVEN TO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS HERE. PAKISTANI SHIAS CLEARLY VIEWED THE VISIT PRIMARILY AS A SECTARIAN ONE, AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE WENT ALL OUT TO ENSURE KHAMENEI'S WELCOME WAS A WARM ONE. HUGE THRONGS OF SHIAS WERE BUSED TO THE AIRPORTS IN LAHORE AND ISLAMABAD TO GREET KHAMENEI AND WELCOMING POSTERS SPRUNG UP IN THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE COUNTRY.  3. THE MONEY FOR THIS MAJOR EFFORT APPARENTLY CAME FROM TWO SOURCES: WEALTHY PAKISTANI SHIAS AND THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT. THE FUNDS WERE FUNNELED PRIMARILY THROUGH TWO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS, THE TEHRIK-E-NIFAZ-E- FIQH-E-JAFFRIA AND THE IMAMIA STUDENTS ORGANIZATION (ISO). THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAD BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE SECTARIAN AGITATION LAST YEAR. HOWEVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- PERHAPS INCLUDING THE FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH -- THEY HAD BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  4. IN UTILIZING THE NEW FUNDS AVAILABLE, THE EXTREMIST SHIAS ENSURED THAT KHAMENEI'S WELCOME TOOK ON A RADICAL, ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US TINGE. THE CROWDS CHANTED ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS, MANY OF THE BANNERS WERE ON AN ANTI-AMERICAN THEME, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF SHIAS AT THE DEPARTURE CEREMONY OPENLY SHOWED DISRESPECT TO PRESIDENT ZIA, SURROUNDING HIS CAR AND MAKING OBSCENE GESTURES.  RENEWED SELF-CONFIDENCE  5. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KHAMENEI VISIT, THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEAR MORE SELF-CONFIDENT THAN THEY HAVE IN MONTHS. SINCE KHAMENEI'S DEPARTURE, THE ISO HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING THE FLURRY OF ANTI-AMERICAN, PRO-LIBYAN RALLIES WHICH OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THESE RALLIES HAVE NOT STRUCK A POPULAR CHORD -- ATTENDANCE HAS ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN SMALL -- BUT THE AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT WHICH HAS GONE INTO THEM AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE POPPED UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY MAKES THIS PHENOMENON NOTEWORTHY.  LIMITS  6. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED BY TWO FACTORS: THE  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH. THE RECENT ACTIVISM OF THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEARS TO BE A MANIFESTATION NOT ONLY OF EUPHORIA FOLLOWING THE KHAMENEI VISIT, BUT ALSO OF A GREATER AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. THE MONEY BEING SPENT NOW --MUCH OF WHICH PRESUMABLY IS LEFT-OVER FROM THE VISIT -- WILL HAVE TO BE REPLENISHED IF THE SHIAS ARE TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT -- THE MOST LIKELY PAYMASTER -- WILL THEN BECOME CRUCIAL -- WILL THE IRANIANS RISK ANTAGONIZING THE GOP TO PLAY THEIR OWN SECTARIAN GAMES IN PAKISTAN?  7. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC IMBALANCE -- AND THE GROWING INTOLERANCE OF SHIA "DEMANDS" BY THE VAST SUNNI MAJORITY, THE SHIAS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE SUCCESSFULLY A SPECIFICALLY SHIA AGENDA. INDEED, THE LEVEL OF GRUMBLING AMONGST THE SUNNIS ABOUT THE SHIAS HAS NOTICEABLY RISEN AS A RESULT OF A PERCEPTION THAT THE SHIAS "HIJACKED" KHAMENEI'S VISIT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND ARE -- ONCE AGAIN -- GROWING UPPITY. PRESIDENT ZIA HIMSELF IS REPORTEDLY ENRAGED BY HIS TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF KHAMENEI'S WELL-WISHERS AND HAS TOLD THE SECURITY FORCES TO CHECK CLOSELY INTO THE OPERATIONS --AND FUNDING -- OF THE RADICAL SHIAS.  8. PRESUMABLY, A RECOGNITION THAT THEY CAN NOT AFFORD TO GO IT ALONE AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHY THE RADICAL SHIAS ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION AND IN PARTICULAR HAVE LASHED ON TO THE LIBYAN CAUSE AS TOOL FOR AMERICAN-BASHING.  9. THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THE MOVEMENT FOR THE RESTORARTION OF DEMOCRACY (MRD), HAS BEEN WILLING TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE SHIAS. IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS A NATURAL ALLIANCE OF GROUPS ON THE OUTS WITH THE PRESENT SYSTEM. FOR THE MRD, HOWEVER, THE SHIAS REPRESENT A TWO-EDGED SWORD: SHIA EXTREMISTS MIGHT HIJACK THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT MOVEMENT FOR THEIR OWN RADICAL PURPOSES, THEREBY ALIENATING MUCH OF THE MRD'S CONSTITUENCY (MANY OF WHOM ARE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE SUNNIS).  COMMENT  10.  FOR THE MOMENT, THE TACTIS OF THE RADICAL SHIAS APPEAR UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED:  THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS FAIRLY FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE, AT LEAST OVER THE SHORT TERM; AND COLONEL QADDHAFI'S CAUSE EVOKES LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY -- TOO MANY PAKISTANIS CONSIDER HIM A TERRORIST. IF, HOWEVER, AN ANTI-AMERICAN CAUSE ARISES AROUND WHICH A LARGER SECTION OF THE PAKISTANI POPULACE CAN UNITE -- AND EVENTS SUCH AS RECENTLY HAPPENED AT THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE COULD PROVE TO BE SUCH A CATALYST -- THE RADICAL SHIAS WILL NO DOUBT DO ALL THEY CAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION.

IN FURTHER DISCUSSION JULY 22, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHAHARYAR KHAN WAS WILLING TO EXPAND ON HIS INITIAL BRIEFING AND TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RAISED IN REF A.  SHAHARYAR MADE CLEAR THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON CONVERSATIONS HE HAD HAD WITH PAKISTANI EMBASSY OFFICIALS, BUSINESSMEN AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES LIVING IN TEHRAN. HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN THERE FOR ONLY FIVE DAYS AND HAD MOVED AROUND THE CITY VERY LITTLE BUT, IN GENERAL WHAT HE HAD SEEN SEEMED TO BEAR OUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD.  HE ADDED THAT THE PRIVATE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY IN TEHRAN IS LARGE, HAS PRETTY GOOD ACCESS, AND HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME.  3.  SHAHARYAR STATED THAT HIS INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GROWING DISENCHANTMENT OF THE POPULATION WERE MEANT TO ENCOMPASS THE LOWER CLASSES.  TO HIM, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING NEW ABOUT DISAFFECTION AMONG THE BOURGEOIS ELEMENT; WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE LOWER CLASSES, BOTH IN TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE ARE INVOLVED.  WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING, HE POINTED TO THE CONSCRIPTION OF 12-13 YEAR OLDS AS THE MAJOR FACTOR, WITH PARENTS NOT BEING WILLING TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A MOVE.  4.  HE HIMSELF HAD NOT BEEN OUTSIDE TEHRAN ON THIS TRIP. HOWEVER, PAKISTAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN MOVE ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER FOREIGNERS.  (AS EVIDENCE, HE RECOUNTED AN ANECDOTE IN WHICH THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON TO HIS SKIING DESTINATION AFTER HIS SCANDINAVIAN COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN TURNED BACK AT A LOCA CHECKPOINT.)  THESE PAKISTANI SOURCES ARE IN AGREEMENT, HE SAID, THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY DIS- ENCHANTED WITH THE WAR.  5.  ACCORDING TO SHAHARYAR, THE "MODERATE" CLERICAL GROUP IS LED BY RAFSANJANI, PRESIDENT KHAMENEI AND FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI.  HE DOUBTED THAT THEY HAD CONVEYED THEI VIEWS ON THE WAR DIRECTLY TO ANY PAKISTANI OFFICIALS BUT SAID THAT IT WAS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR IRANIAN THIRD PARTIES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VIEWS TO THE PAKISTAN EMBASSY.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE LEADERS HAD YET OPENLY DEBATED ANY DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON THE WAR WITH THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENEI NOR DID HE THINK THAT KHOMENEI WAS LIKELY TO BE PERSUADED BY SUCH A DEBATE.  AS TO ANY "MIDDLE GROUND," IN SHAHARYAR'S VIEW NO ONE IN IRAN, INCLUDING KHOMENEI, WOULD SERIOUSLY HOLD OUT FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE BAATH PARTY AS A PRECONDITION FOR ENDIN THE WAR EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A PUBLIC IRANIAN DEMAND. HE RESTATED THAT WHAT THE MODERATES ARE LOOKING AT IS A SOLUTION WHICH WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE DEPARTURE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER.  6.  SHAHARYAR WAS RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO WHETHER ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER AMONG THE CLERGY IS MOVING INTO THE ASCENDANT OR ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TIME BEYOND WHICH THE PRESENT SITUATION WOULD NOT ENDURE.  HE DID SAY THAT HIS OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL PAKISTANI CONTACTS GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT ONE YEAR WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE PRESENT SITUATION COULD CONTINUE WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT DOING SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT BUT QUICKLY ADDED THAT HE HAD HEARD TOO MANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE PAST FOR HIM TO GIVE THEM MUCH CREDENCE.  7.  SHAHARYAR SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI IS ANXIOUS TO VISIT ISLAMABAD PRIOR TO THE NAM MEETING IN HARARE AND THAT DATES IN THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF AUGUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED (BUT NOT YET NAILED DOWN). ACCORDING TO HIM, THE GOI IS CONCERNED THAT IRAQ MAY BE HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN NAM CIRCLES ON A RESOLUTION THAT IRAN WOULD FIND ONESIDED AND IS ANXIOUS TO CONSULT WITH THE GOP ON THIS ISSUE.  SHAHARYAR EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO PASS ON ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE FUTURE.   MCCARTHY

REFTEL REQUESTS INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL'S QUESTIONS.  2.  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM:  THE GOP IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  IT DOES NOT/NOT SUPPORT, SPONSOR OR TOLERATE TERRORIST GROUPS, TACTICS, OR METHODS.  IT HAS NOT/NOT GIVEN ANY SUPPORT PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY TO A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL TERRORISTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR WITH SANCTUARIES AND TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOP DENIES THESE ACCUSATIONS.  HARD EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT BACK UP INDIA'S CHARGES IS LACKING.  3.  1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES THIS YEAR.  THE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN PRISON.  THEIR APPEALS ARE STILL PENDING IN THE COURTS.  4.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS IN 1989:  THE GOP HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY NEW MAJOR POLICY EFFORTS ON COUNTERTERRORISM IN 1989.  (THE GOP HAS CREATED THE PARAMILITARY "SINDH FORCE" TO HELP DEAL WITH LAW-AND-ORDER DIFFICULTIES IN SINDH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS ETHNIC COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, RATHER THAN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.)  THE GOP HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTITERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.  PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  THREE TRAINING COURSES -- EACH WITH ABOUT THIRTY PAKISTANI PARTICIPANTS -- HAVE BEEN HELD THIS YEAR IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT, AIPORT SECURITY, AND DEALING WITH EXPLOSIVES INCIDENTS.  5. GOVERNMENT RESPONSES ON TERRORISM AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES:  THERE WERE NO TERRORIST INCIDENTS AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR FACILITIES IN 1989.  THE ONE ATTACK, ON THE AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER IN ISLAMABAD ON FEBRUARY 12, IS PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS MOB VIOLENCE RATHER THAN A TERRORIST INCIDENT.  LOCAL POLICE SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE CENTER, ALTHOUGH SIX PEOPLE IN THE CROWD (NO AMERICANS) DIED FROM POLICE BULLETS AND THE BUILDING SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.   OAKLEY

REFTEL REQUESTED INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARA FIVE OF REFTEL.  2.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES THIS YEAR.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN SOVIETS ARRESTED AS A RESULT OF THE AUGUST 19, 1990, HIJACKING OF AN AEROFLOT PASSENGER AIRLINER ARE INCARCERATED IN KARACHI AWAITING TRIAL.  (THE ELEVENTH RECENTLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN PRISON.)  THREE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN PRISON.  DURING THE RECENT ELECTION CAMPAIGN, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED TO HAVE UNCOVERED A "PLOT TO DESTABILIZE" THE COUNTRY, CENTERED IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF SINDH, ENCOURAGED BY THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND IMPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH PAKISTAN'S AL ZULFIKAR ORGANIZATION ( A TERRORIST GROUP ACTIVE IN THE EARLY 1980S).  A NUMBER OF PAKISTANI SUSPECTS ARE IN JAIL; THE AUTHORITIES CLAIM TO HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION THROUGH CONFESSIONS OF INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  3.  EXTRADITIONS:  THERE WERE NONE; THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  4.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC (I.E., LEGAL, POLITICAL, OR PROCEDURAL) IMPEDIMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD.  5.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM AND, PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, HAS CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORIST VIOLENCE.  PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF NUMEROUS TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING 1990, PRIMARILY BOMBINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND AFGHAN RESISTANCE GROUPS.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN APPEARS TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INVQGATE EACH INCIDENT FULLY, RESULTS ARE HAMPERED BY THE POLICE'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES.  6.  MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT:  PAKISTAN HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY MAJOR STEPS OR DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN 1990. PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND ONE TRAINING COURSE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT WAS PROVIDED THIS YEAR TO EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTI-TERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE CENTRALIZED NATIONAL POLICE AGENCIES, AND THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED NATURE OF SENIOR LEVELS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUREAUCRACY, HAVE MADE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DIFFICULT.  SINCE THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINED GOOD AIRPORT SECURITY PROCEDURES.  7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL INSURGENTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR, INCLUDING PROVIDING OR TOLERATING SANCTUARIES AND TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN SAYS IT GIVES MORAL SUPPORT TO THE KASHMIRI INSURGENTS BUT DENIES THE INDIAN ACCUSATIONS OF TANGIBLE AID.  8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN HAS NOT GIVEN ANY PUBLIC SUPPORT TO A TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE, IT HAS NOT OFFERED ANY SUCH SUPPORT PRIVATELY EITHER.  9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989: THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INQ ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM.   OAKLEY

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PK SUBJECT:  SHARIA--WHERE DID IT GO?  1. LOU- ENTIRE TEXT  2.  ONE MONTH AGO, THE LEADING TOPIC OF POLITICAL DISCUSSION IN MUCH OF PAKISTAN WAS THE PRIME MINISTER'S SHARIA BILL, OSTENSIBLY MEANT TO "ISLAMIZE" PAKISTANI LAWS, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY. DEBATE RAGED IN THE PRESS BETWEEN CRITICS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, WHO ARGUED THAT THE BILL WAS TOO WEAK, AND LIBERALS WHO PREDICTED IT WOULD--AT A MINIMUM--INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES.  DAILY EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, AND INTERVIEWS HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIONS OF COMPETING POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEADERS.  THE BILL'S INTRODUCTION INTO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON MAY 12 THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL LINE-UP, WITH THE SECULAR PDA, ANP, AND MQM ALLIED WITH THE ISLAMIST PARTIES AGAINST THE BILL.  3.  IN CONTRAST TO POPULAR EXPECTATIONS, HOWEVER, THE GENERAL PREOCCUPATION WITH SHARIA DISAPPEARED ALMOST OVERNIGHT AFTER ITS MAY 16 PASSAGE BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  SHARIA'S PASSAGE BY THE SENATE ON MAY 28 DREW LITTLE NOTICE--THE SENATE MADE NO CHANGES, ESSENTIALLY RUBBER-STAMPING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY'S DECISION.  AT THE TIME, BOTH THE PRESS AND MEMBERS OF NAWAZ'S IJI COALITION PREDICTED PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN WOULD SIGN THE BILL INTO LAW WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.  THREE WEEKS LATER, HOWEVER, SHARIA HAS LARGELY DISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC DISCUSSION.  A SURVEY OF PAKISTAN'S LEADING DAILIES FOUND NO MENTION EITHER OF PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN'S UNEXPLAINED DELAY IN SIGNING IT, OR OF HIS FINALLY SIGNING SHARIA INTO LAW ON JUNE 14.  A TRUE NON-EVENT.  4. WE BELIEVE MOST OF THIS SUDDEN DECLINE OF INTEREST IS DUE TO NAWAZ'S SUCCESS IN CREATING AN ACT THAT IS LONG ON RHETORIC BUT BRINGS NO IMMEDIATE CHANGE TO PAKISTANIS' DAILY LIVES.  WHILE THERE WAS STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR LANGUAGE THAT COULD--FOR BETTER OR WORSE--AFFECT PAKISTANI'S LIVING CONDITIONS, THE ACT WAS OF INTENSE INTEREST.  MANY LIBERALS, WOMEN AND MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES REMAIN LEARY OF THE SHARIA LEGISLATION--CITING, FOR EXAMPLE, ABUSES OF THE HADOOD (ISLAMIC PUNISHMENT) ORDINANCES UNDER GENERAL ZIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED LEGISLATION CAN BE TWISTED TO FIT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  EVEN THEY, HOWEVER, HAVE ADMITTED TO US THAT THE TEXT OF THE ACT ITSELF IS LESS AN ISSUE THAN THE DEPARTURES THIS OR A FUTURE REGIME MIGHT TAKE FROM THE LETTER OF THE LAW.  (THE PUNATIVE ARTICLES OF THE HADOOD ORDINANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ENFORCED WHILE ACCOMPANYING PROTECTIONS GIVEN WOMEN HAVE OFTEN FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE.)  CRITICS SUCH AS THE PDA'S AITZAZ AHSAN ARE, IN FACT, MORE CRITICAL OF THE BILL'S VAGUENESS--ALLOWING NEW INTERPRETATIONS "AT WILL"--THAN OF ANY MANDATE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE ACT.  5.  THE AMENDMENTS INSERTED INTO THE ACT DURING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATE HAVE HELPED DEFUSE THE ISSUE FOR MOST PAKISTANIS.  THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED AN AMENDMENT, JOINTLY PROPOSED BY FIVE MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES, STATING THAT "NOTHING CONTAINED HEREUNDER SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON-MUSLIMS GUARANTEED BY OR UNDER THE CONSTITUTION."  SIMILARLY, NAWAZ READILY AGREED TO AN AMENDMENT STATING "THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED (BY SHARIA)."  A THIRD AMENDMENT, PROPOSED BY THE SECULAR ANP AS THE PRICE OF THEIR SUPPORT, STATES THAT "NOTHING CONTAINED HERE SHALL AFFECT PAKISTAN'S EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM."  THE INITIAL THREE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR THE ABOLITION OF INTEREST WAS REPLACING IT WITH THE VAGUE "SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME."  ANOTHER AMENDMENT, DEFINING THE QURAN AND SUNNAH AS THE SOURCE OF PAKISTANI LAW--RATHER THAN THE SUM TOTAL OF LAW, IN AND OF ITSELF--ESSENTIALLY BLOCKS ATTEMPTS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTION OR LEGISLATING WITH CITATIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE QURAN.  6.  COMMENT: MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED DURING THE WEEKS BETWEEN NAWAZ'S PROPOSAL OF SHARIA AND ITS PASSAGE BY PARLIAMENT WILL REMAIN HIGH ON PAKISTAN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA FOR YEARS TO COME.  IN FACT, THE BILL WAS ADVERTISED AS ONLY BEING A BROAD COMMITTMENT TO AN ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MUST LATER BE FLESHED OUT BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION DRAFTED TO CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BASIC LAW. WIDE DIFFERENCES REMAIN WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY OVER THE PROPER ROLE OF RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND SOCIETY, WITH A SMALL BUT VOCAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT STILL DETERMINED TO DICTATE ITS VIEWS TO SOCIETY AT LARGE.  SIMILARLY, A COALITION OF WOMEN'S, MINORITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS REMAIN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE ACT.  WHILE THEY TELL US THEY RECOGNIZE THE SHARIA ACT IS A FAIT ACOMPLI, THEY ARE MOBILIZING AGAINST FUTURE SHARIA-RELATED LEGISLATION. THEREFORE, WHILE THE SHARIA ACT PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI PARLIAMENT IN MAY 1991 DOES NOT, IN THE END, REPRESENT THE TYPE OF ATTACK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES MANY IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE FEARED, THE CONCERN OVER THE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL REMAIN.

CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT.  2.  SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF'S SHARIA (ISLAMIZATION) ACT, PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ONE YEAR AGO, WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY ON PAKISTANI POLITICS.  THE POORLY DRAFTED AND VAGUELY WORDED DOCUMENT PRODUCED NO DRAMATIC CHANGE IN PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE LAW, IN FACT, REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMISTS WHO HAD PROPOSED FAR MORE SWEEPING ISLAMIZATION LEGISLATION.  NONETHELESS, ALTHOUGH THE ISLAMIC RIGHT REMAINS BUT A PERIPHERAL FORCE IN PAKISTANI LEGISLATIVE POLITICS, THEIR SINGLE-MINDED PURSUIT OF THEIR GOAL OF AN ISLAMIC STATE IS INCREASINGLY SHAPING CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI CULURE.  3.  ISLAMIST ACTIVISM POSES A REAL THREAT TO PAKISTANI STABILITY AND PROGRESS.  BY PROMOTING INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS WIDENED THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS SECTS, CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT PAKISTAN, AND HAMPERED THE GOP'S ABILITY TO SET POLICY BOTH IN DOMESTIC AREAS SUCH AS FAMILY PLANNING AND ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES LIKE AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR.  4.  THEIR "SUCCESSES," HOWEVER, SUCH AS THEY ARE, HAVE NOT WON THE ISLAMISTS BROAD POPULAR SUPPORT. WE ANTICIPATE NEITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN PAKISTAN NOR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  RATHER WHAT WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE IS A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S ABILITY TO USE ITS MILITANT MEMBERS TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA UNCHECKED.  END SUMMARY.  -------------------------------- WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON? --------------------------------  5.  WHEN THE PAKISTAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF'S SHARIA ("ISLAMIC LAW") BILL IN MAY 1991, THE PM'S CONFIDANTS PRIVATELY DESCRIBED IT AS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY OVER THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  BY INTRODUCING HIS OWN SHARIA BILL, NAWAZ HAD ESSENTIALLY BOTH ACCEDED TO THE ISLAMISTS' CAMPAIGN PRESSING THE GOP TO INSTITUTE ISLAMIC LAW AND DERAILED IT, BY WATERING THE LEGISLATION DOWN TO THE POINT OF MEANINGLESSNESS.  6.  THE SHARA ACT ITSELF WAS POORLY DRAFTED AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF VAGUE STATEMENTS CALLING FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF PAKISTAN INTO AN "ISLAMIC WELFARE STATE" AND MANDATING THAT MUSLIM CITIZENS "ORDER THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW."  THE ONLY GOP ACTION ACTUALLY MANDATED IN ITS TEXT WAS THE CREATION OF COMMITTEES TO STUDY METHODS OF ISLAMIZING EDUCATION AND THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FROM THE ECONOMY.  IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER SHARIA BILLS DRAFTED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NAWAZ'S SHARIA ACT ALSO GUARANTEED THE INVIOLABILITY OF PAKISTAN'S PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTAINED LANGUAGE SAFEGUARDING THE RIGHTS OF PAKISTAN'S NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES.  ONE YEAR AFTER THE ACT'S PASSAGE, IT REMAINS ESSENTIALLY IRRELEVANT TO PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY.  THE FEARS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS, AND WOMEN'S GROUPS THAT THE ACT WOULD TRANSFORM PAKISTAN INTO A THEOCRACY, GUTTING THE ECONOMY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE PROCESS, REMAIN ESSENTIALLY UNREALIZED.  ----------------------------------- ISLAMIZATION THROUGH THE BACK DOOR? -----------------------------------  7.  MEANWHILE, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES ARE WEAKER THAN EVER WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE, AND WITH THE DEFECTION OF THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--THE LARGEST ISLAMIST PARTY--FROM NAWAZ'S RULING COALITION, THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY IS FURTHER DIMINISHED.  THE ISLAMISTS' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS TEACHERS AND LEADERS OF CONGREGATIONS GIVES THEM A READY PULPIT, HOWEVER, TO PROMOTE ISLAMIZATION AS THE ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OTHERWISE FAR FROM THE SPHERE OF RELIGION -- THE DIVISION BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, THE DECLINING ACCESS OF THE POOR TO EDUCATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, AND THE ERODING LAW-AND-ORDER SITUATION.  8.  THE ISLAMISTS' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR ABILITY TO BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITANT STUDENT SUPPORTERS OUT INTO THE STREETS AT SHORT NOTICE, HAVE LED SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OF PAKISTAN TO APPEASE THEM RATHER THAN CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY. UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS, SUCH APPEASEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF PROHIBITION, LEGISLATION DEFINING THE POLYDOX AHMEDI SECT AS "NON-MUSLIM," AND THE INSTITUTION OF ISLAMIC CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR EXTRAMARITAL SEX OR OTHER "UN-ISLAMIC" BEHAVIOR. DESPITE NAWAZ'S SUCCESSFUL DERAILMENT OF THE MOVEMENT FOR A SHARIA BILL, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF PAKISTANI CULTURE AND SOCIETY CONTINUES TO GROW.  9.  FOR EXAMPLE, PAKISTAN'S FASTEST GROWING RELIGIOUS PARTIES -- THE ANJUMAN SEPAH-I-SAHABA PAKISTAN (ASSP) -- ACTIVELY CRUSADES FOR THE CREATION OF A SUNNI STATE, WITH SHIAS DECLARED "NON-MUSLIM."  BOTH THE ASSP AND ITS PRIMARY NEMESIS THE SHIA TEHRIK-I-NIFAZ-I-FIQAH-JAFARIA (TNFJ) HAVE PROFITED BY ARTICULATING AND ENCOURAGING A GROWING STRAIN OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY WHICH IS FAR MORE WIDESPREAD, AND DANGEROUS, THAN ANY THE NATION HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED.  10.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INCREASING RELIANCE BY OFFICIALS ON "ISLAMIC" PROVISIONS IN THE PAKISTANI PENAL CODE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE WHICH PENALIZES BLASPHEMY IS, IN THE VIEW OF MANY OBSERVERS, INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO INTIMIDATE AND HARRASS NON-MUSLIMS.  A PENDING CASE AGAINST PROMINENT SOCIOLOGIST DR. AKHTAR HAMEED KHAN (REF B) CHARGES HIS RECENTLY-PUBLISHED CHILDREN'S STORY IS AN ALLEGORICAL SLAP AT PROPHET MOHAMMED'S FAMILY. SEVERAL CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY CHARGED IN RECENT MONTHS, USUALLY AFTER FINANCIAL OR POLITICAL DISPUTES WITH ISLAMISTS.  A CHRISTIAN TEACHER WAS KILLED IN JANUARY 1992 BY A TEENAGER WHO HAD READ AN ANONYMOUS FLYER ACCUSING THE TEACHER OF INSULTING ISLAM.  EQUALLY TROUBLING WERE THE (FORTUNATELY UNSUCCESSFUL) EFFORTS OF THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST JAMIAT ULEMA-I-ISLAM (JUI) PARTY TO PRESSURE THE BALOCHISTAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INTO DECLARING A LOCAL SECT, THE ZIKRIS, TO BE NON-MUSLIM.  A DECISION TO THAT EFFECT COULD HAVE SPARKED SERIOUS SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN THAT PROVINCE.  11.  CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI TELEVISION ALSO LARGELY REFLECTS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S IDEA OF "ISLAMIC" BEHAVIOR AND ITS GROWING INFLUENCE.  CNN BROADCASTS ARE HEAVILY CENSORED WITH SCENES OF WOMEN IN "UN-ISLAMIC" DRESS OR EVEN OF MOTHERS KISSING THEIR CHILDREN BLANKED OUT.  GUIDELINES FOR WOMEN'S DRESS IN DOMESTIC BROADCASTS WERE RECENTLY TIGHTENED, WITH WOMEN NOW REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR HEADS REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CHARACTER THEY ARE PORTRAYING. POSITIVE PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL ROLES ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  DISCUSSION OF SUCH ISSUES AS AIDS, BIRTH CONTROL, AND SEXUAL HARRASSMENT IS RARE AND GENERAL, WITH AIDS IN PARTICULAR OFTEN TIED TO "WESTERN BEHAVIOR" SUCH AS THE "FREE MINGLING OF THE SEXES."  12.  IN YET ANOTHER AREA, EDUCATION, THE GOP HAS REGULARLY ACCEDED TO ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO INCREASE THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. LONG-STANDING LEGISLATION MANDATING ISLAMIC AND QURANIC STUDIES FOR ALL MUSLIM STUDENTS HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN REVISED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME DEDICATED TO "ISLAMIA."  WHILE NON-MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE EXEMPTED FROM ISLAMIC STUDIES, ALL CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS--REGARDLESS OF FAITH--MUST PASS ORAL AND WRITTEN EXAMS ON ISLAMIC STUDIES.  THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO THIS SECTION WITHIN THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM HAS, MOREOVER, BEEN RAISED TO THE POINT THAT MUSLIM CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS HAVE COMPLAINED TO US THAT ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.  13.  THE GOP IS ALSO UNDER GROWING ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO ADD RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION TO THE INFORMATION INCLUDED ON CITIZENS' NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS, WHICH MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE A PAKISTANI CAN LEGALLY VOTE, APPLY FOR A JOB, BE ADMITTED TO UNIVERSITY, OR ENTER MILITARY SERVICE.  --------------------------------------------- -- DEMOCRACY CHALLENGED: THEOCRATIC PRIMACY AHEAD? --------------------------------------------- --  14.  CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MODERNIST AND ISLAMIST OUTLOOKS HAS BEEN SHARPEST IN REACTION TO THE FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT'S INCREASED ACTIVISM. GENERAL ZIA CREATED THE SHARIAT COURT IN 1980 TO BOLSTER HIS ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, APPOINTING AND FIRING JUDGES AT WILL TO ENSURE FAVORABLE VERDICTS. SINCE ZIA'S DEATH, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS BEEN STEERING A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE GOP.  RULINGS SINCE JUNE 1990 INCLUDE: JUDGMENTS REPLACING CIVIL PENAL CODES WITH AN "ISLAMIC" SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENTS; A NOVEMBER 1991 SHARIAT COURT RULING DEFINING ALL INTEREST PAYMENTS AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND A MAY 1992 RULING UNDERCUTTING THE PROTECTIONS IN THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY FEATURE OF THE SHARIA ACT AND A CHECK ON ISLAMIST EFFORTS TO SUBORDINATE THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO THE MULLAHS.  THE GOP REPORTEDLY HAS NO INTENTION OF IMPLEMENTING THESE JUDGMENTS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN FROZEN IN AN APPELLATE COURT.  TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT HAS ALSO AVOIDED ANY ATTEMPT TO REIN IN THE SHARIAT COURT.  15.  MOST DISTURBING TO OBSERVERS, BUT SO FAR UNDERPLAYED BY THE GOP, IS THE SHARIAT COURT'S CHALLENGE TO PAKISTAN'S CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  TECHNICALLY, THE COURT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED FROM TOUCHING CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND COURT OFFICIALS ASSURE US THEY HAVE NO INTENTION TO DO SO UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE.  THE SHARIAT COURT'S ASSERTIONS IN RECENT RULINGS, HOWEVER, THAT MAN-MADE DOCUMENTS OR HUMANLY-ELECTED PARLIAMENTS MUST BE SUBORDINATE TO ISLAMIC LAW--AS INTERPRETED BY THE SHARIAT COURT-- IMPLY JUST SUCH A WEAKENING OF THE CONSTITUTION'S INVIOLABILITY.  DURING A RECENT ISLAMABAD SEMINAR ON ISLAMIZATION, RETIRED LAHORE HIGH COURT JUDGE JAVED IQBAL DEFINED THE BASIC QUESTION AS ONE OF POWER. "WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OR JUDGES APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT?"  IN IQBAL'S VIEW, PAKISTAN NOW HAS TWO INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEMS IN OPERATION, ONE DEMOCRATIC AND ONE THEOCRATIC, NEITHER ONE OF WHICH CAN WORK UNTIL THE GOP CHOOSES BETWEEN THEM.  ------- COMMENT -------  16.  THE PRIMARY DANGER THAT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT REPRESENTS TO PAKISTAN IS THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES FUEL THE FRAGMENTATION OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE TIES THAT BIND TOGETHER PAKISTAN'S MANY ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED TO SOME DEGREE.  TOGETHER WITH MILITANT ETHNIC NATIONALIST GROUPS, THE ISLAMIST PARTIES FURTHER SPLINTER SOCIETY BY FEEDING THE PERCEPTION WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY THAT IT IS UNDER SEIGE.  BATTLES BETWEEN SECTARIAN GROUPS ARE THE MOST GRAPHIC RESULT. EQUALLY, THE ISLAMISTS POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO PAKISTAN'S LONG-TERM INTERESTS, AS FEAR OF PROVOKING THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS CONSTRAINED THE THE GOP'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS KEY ISSUES -- WHETHER DOMESTIC, SUCH AS EDUCATION AND BIRTH CONTROL, OR FOREIGN, SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR.  17.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT PAKISTAN IS HEADED FOR EITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IS TOO FRAGMENTED, IDEOSYNCRATIC,  AND--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHLY CENTRALIZED JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--FAR TOO DISORGANIZED TO FORM A BROAD-BASED NATIONAL MOVEMENT.  NO GROUP HAS YET DEMONSTRATED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT AND THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS LEADERS THEMSELVES ARE POPULARLY VIEWED AS POWER-HUNGRY, CORRUPT, AND PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECTS OF ISLAM.  EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT BOOST IN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SEATS IN 1990 DUE TO THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE WINNING IJI COALITION, THE ISLAMISTS' SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE HAS DECLINED WITH EVERY NATIONAL ELECTION SINCE THE CREATION OF PAKISTAN.  18.  THEIR LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND ELECTORAL STRENGTH WILL KEEP THE ISLAMISTS FROM POSING A DIRECT POLITICAL THREAT TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. THE SYMBOLIC AND EMOTIONAL VALUE OF THE "ISLAMIC" CALL, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE ISLAMISTS' MORE MILITANT SUPPORTERS, MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF TROUBLE.  IN SUM, WE ANTICIPATE A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELGIOUS RIGHT'S ABILITY TO TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA UNCHECKED.  19.  THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MISSION REPORTING PLAN.   PLATT 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 010894   DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR S/CT FOR REAP, AND SA/PAB  E.O. 12356:  N/A TAGS:  PTER, PK SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT  REF:  STATE 286744  1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  2.  A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP IN 1994 ARRESTED SEVERAL DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF BOMBINGS OR OTHER INTERNAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  WHILE THE GOP OFTEN CLAIMED THAT THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WAS BEHIND THE ATTACKS AND SOMETIMES LABELS THEM AS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, THE GOP HAS NOT YET PROVIDED COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF INTERNATIONAL LINKS.  WE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY PAKISTANI SECTARIAN ORGANIZATIONS OR CRIMINAL ELEMENTS.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  3.  B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT IN 1994.  THE TREATY WAS DIRECTED AT EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS LIVING IN THE TRIBAL AREAS OF PAKISTAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE WANTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES IN EGYPT.  THE TREATY HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO FORCE, AND THEREFORE THE GOP HAS NOT YET CARRIED OUT ANY EXTRADITIONS.  4.  C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION/EXTRADITION.  THE "TRIBAL AREAS" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT UNDER THE COMPLETE LEGAL OR PRACTICAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOP.  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR GOP AUTHORITIES TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE AREAS.  ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, PROVINCIAL POLICE HAVE THE PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  MANY OF THESE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT VIGOROUS ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.  5.  D.  OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO TERRORISM  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED FULLY IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING AND IN TRYING TO APPREHEND ONE OF THE SUSPECTED PARTICIPANTS IN THE BOMBING, RAMZI AHMED YOUSEF, WHO IS THOUGHT TO BE IN PAKISTAN.  6.  E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1994  THE GOP, ACTING ON THE REQUEST OF SEVERAL ARAB GOVERNMENTS, DURING 1994 REFUSED TO EXTEND THE VISAS OF MANY ARABS WHO HAD FOUGHT IN THE AFGHAN WAR AND WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE TRIBAL AREAS AND PAKISTAN'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.  MANY OF THESE ARABS ARE SUSPECTED OF LINKS TO TERRORIST OR OTHER QUESTIONABLE ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.  THE GOP ALSO CLOSED DOWN SEVERAL ARAB NGO'S IT BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS COVER ORGANIZATIONS FOR ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  7.  F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA.  GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY.  8.  G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1994 IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTS, OR COUNTRIES SPONSORING TERRORISM.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PM BHUTTO, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL.  THE GOP CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPINGS IN JUNE AND OCTOBER 1994 OF FOREIGN TOURISTS BY REPUTED KASHMIRI MILITANTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND IN NEW DELHI.  9.  H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993.  WE HAVE NOTED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOP'S COOPERATION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM DURING 1994.  END OF ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  MONJO 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 010938   S/CT FOR REAP/COLLINS  E.O. 12958:  N/A TAGS:  PTER, PK SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  1995 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT  REF:  STATE 245276  1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  2. A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  IN NOVEMBER 1995, A KARACHI COURT CONVICTED 13 MEMBERS OF AN EXTREMIST SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP AND SENTENCED THEM TO DEATH FOR ATTACKS ON TWO SHIA MOSQUES IN KARACHI IN EARLY 1995.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS IN PAKISTAN IN 1995 ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  3. B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS.  THE GOP ACTED SWIFTLY AND IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE USG IN FEBRUARY 1995 TO EXTRADITE TO THE U.S. SUSPECTED WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBER RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF.  INTERIOR MINISTER NASERULLAH BABAR HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXTRADITED TEN SUSPECTED EGYPTIAN TERRORISTS TO EGYPT.  4. C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS.  THE "TRIBAL AREAS" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN DO NOT FALL UNDER THE WRIT OF PAKISTANI LAW AND ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT.  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE GOP TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREAS.  ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, MANY POLICE OFFICIALS WITH PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.  INFLUENTIAL ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY OPPOSE GOP COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM, TERMING SUCH COOPERATION AN OPERATION AGAINST ISLAM.  5. D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION.  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN THE ONGOING USG INVESTIGATION OF THE MARCH 8, 1995 MURDER IN KARACHI OF TWO AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF THE CONSULATE GENERAL, AND ACCEPTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE INVEQEMBER 19, 1995, BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  THE GOP GRANTED A WAIVER OF SPECIALITY FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN PLOTS TO BLOW UP AIRCRAFT IN ASIA.  6. E.  CT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1995.  DURING HER TRIP TO WASHINGTON IN APRIL 1995, PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO OFFERED PAKISTAN'S FULL COOPERATION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR HAS SUBSEQUENTLY REITERATED THAT PLEDGE OF COOPERATION.  DURING 1995, GOP OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT THE GOP CLOSED DOWN SOME PAKISTANI OFFICES OF KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUPS.  7. F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA.  GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  HOWEVER, ANTI-INDIAN MILITANT GROUPS OPERATE FREELY IN PAKISTAN AND ARE PERMITTED TO RAISE FUNDS AND RECRUIT NEW CADRE.  THIS POLICY CREATES FERTILE GROUND FOR THE OPERATIONS OF OTHER MILITANT AND TERRORIST GROUPS IN PAKISTAN.  THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN KARACHI.  8. G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1995 IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR TERRORIST ACTS.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND PRESIDENT FAROOQ LEGHARI, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED TERRORISM IN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. CONSULATE GENERAL EMPLOYEES IN KARACHI, THE KIDNAPPING OF FOREIGN TOURISTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND THE MURDER OF ONE HOSTAGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER RABIN, THE BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG OFFICE IN RIYADH, AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  9. H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1994.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOP COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY IN 1995, ALTHOUGH GOP OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED AN INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE BROWN AMENDMENT, IF/WHEN SIGNED INTO LAW, WILL PERMIT EXPANDED U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN AND MAKE COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION EASIER.

S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 005972   FROM THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR.  E.O. 12958:  DECL: 7/14/06 TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PINR, PK, IZ, LY, SA, IR SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN, ISLAMIC TERROR AND HUA  1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR., AMBASSADOR. REASON:  1.5 (B), (C) AND (D).  2.  (S) DURING THE COURSE OF FRANK WISNER'S AND MY LUNCHEON WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ON JULY 12, SHE NOTED THAT SHE WAS PICKING UP DISTURBING INTELLIGENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF RELIGIOUS MADRASSAS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING YOUTH TRAINING CAMPS WHICH COULD BE SPAWNING TERRORISM.  THE MOST RECENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE ARE FUNDED FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  SHE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS PRIVATE SAUDI FINANCE INVOLVED, BUT SHE HAS DIRECTED THAT THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT BE APPROACHED.  3.  (S) IN THIS CONTEXT SHE EXPRESSED ONCE AGAIN HER SYMPATHY FOR THE KILLING OF THE 19 AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ASKED THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HER IN IDENTIFYING ANY LINES WHICH CONNECT WHAT IS GOING ON IN PAKISTAN TO OTHER TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  I UNDERTOOK TO DO SO AND ASKED THAT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHARE WITH US WHATEVER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO PAKISTAN.  4.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUED, NOTING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT A NEW ONE.  THE IRANIANS, LIBYANS AND IRAQIS HAD IN THE PAST FUNDED SIMILAR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.  THE GENERAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED AT A RECENT CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER WHICH SHE HAD CHAIRED.  THE POLITICAL CONTEXT WAS WHAT SHE SAW AS A FAIRLY ELABORATE AND WELL ARTICULATED PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT INVOLVES QASI HUSSEIN AHMED, AMIR OF THE JAMIAT-I-ISLAMI, BUT ONE OF THE GUIDING FORCES WAS FORMER ISI DIRECTOR HAMID GUL.  THE MECHANISM ENVISAGED WAS TO BEGIN WITH OPPOSITION TO THE BUDGET AND CONSTRUCT AN EVER-BROADENING POLITICAL MOVEMENT WITH DEMANDS FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.  ELEMENTS WOULD BE THE DEMAND FOR A NEW CENSUS, DEMAND FOR A NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD, AND INVOCATION OF ARTICLE 62 OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH LIMITS CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO THOSE DEFINED AS GOOD MUSLIMS.  THE INTENTION WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE DEFINITION OF A GOOD MUSLIM ONLY TO GRADUATES OF MADRASSAS OR ISLAMIC UNIVERSITIES.  THE PRIME MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS CATCHING ON.  AS SHE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE SIMPLY THE PASSIVE OBJECT OF SUCH A CAMPAIGN BUT WAS OBLIGED TO REACT AND BE ACTIVE IN ITS OWN DEFENSE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY.  5.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN TO THE VEXING ISSUE OF THE HUA.  I BEGAN BY THANKING HER FOR HER VERY FIRM COMMENTS IN HER MEETING WITH THE SPOUSES OF THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  I RECALLED IN PARTICULAR HER REQUEST THAT WE BRING TO HER ATTENTION ANY SOLID INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE THE SUSPECTS BROUGHT IN AND STRONGLY INTERROGATED.  IN FACT, SHE INTERJECTED, SHE HAD ASKED MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NASEERULLAH KHAN BABAR TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE FBI ON THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  PAKISTAN ITSELF, AFTER THE MOST THOROUGH REVIEW BY ALL AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT -- INTELLIGENCE, ARMY AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES -- HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DISCOVER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HARAKAT UL ANSAR PEOPLE THAT THEY KNEW AND THE HOSTAGE TAKERS.  AT THE SAME TIME SHE RECOGNIZED THAT ALL OUTSIDE INTERLOCUTORS WERE CONVINCED THAT THERE IS SUCH A CONNECTION.  THE BRITISH HAD MADE THIS CLEAR TO THEM AND SHE ASSUMED THAT THE AMERICANS HAD THE SAME VIEW.  6.  (S) FRANK WISNER ASSURED HER THAT THAT IS THE CASE, OUTLINING BRIEFLY THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN HAND ABOUT HUA COMPLICITY IN SEVERAL KIDNAPPING EVENTS IN INDIA, INCLUDING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGE INCIDENT.  THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SHE COULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT OF HUA MIGHT BE INVOLVED, RECALLING THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ARMY PLOT OF SEPTEMBER 1995.  SHE ASKED THE FOREIGN SECRETARY TO CONTACT THE MILITARY AND ASK IF ANY OF THE HUA PLOTTERS IN THE ARMY COUP WERE AWARE OF PLANS TO TAKE HOSTAGES IN KASHMIR.  7.  (S) WISNER AND I AGREED THAT THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL.  I ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER TO DELAY TAKING ACTION WITH BABAR ABOUT THE FBI UNTIL JOHN HOLZMAN OR I HAD A CHANCE TO BRING TO HER ATTENTION INFORMATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED ON THE HOSTAGE CRISIS.

(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR TOM PRICE. REASON: 1.5 (D).  SUMMARY -------  2.  (C) MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, TOLD POLOFF AND AARMA THAT VARIOUS OPTIONS ARE BEING REVIEWED FOR THE TALIBAN'S ATTACK ON SOROBI.  ACCORDING TO JALIL, RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE "WARM," BUT IRAN IS TRYING TO STIR UP TROUBLE.  JALIL ASSERTED THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME IN KANDAHAR.  HE WARNED THE UN SPECIAL MISSION THAT IT SHOULD NOT SET UP ITS MAIN OFFICE IN KABUL.  END SUMMARY.  ------------------ OPTIONS FOR SOROBI ------------------  3.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA MET WITH MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, AND COMMANDER HAJI BASHIR, A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN'S GREATER SHURA, ON SEPTEMBER 18.  MULLAH JALIL BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY STATING THAT THE TALIBAN ARE CONSIDERING VARIOUS OPTIONS ON HOW TO ATTACK SOROBI.  SOROBI IS NOW UNDER SIEGE FROM THE EAST AND THE SOUTH, HE CONTINUED, AND WILL BE UNDER SIEGE FROM THE WEST SOON.  HOWEVER, THE TALIBAN ARE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE KABUL REGIME HAS FORTIFIED THE SOROBI AREA HEAVILY WITH TANKS AND ARTILLERY, HE SAID.  THUS, THE TALIBAN ARE TAKING THEIR TIME TO DECIDE ON THEIR BATTLE PLANS.  JALIL NOTED THAT THE KEY TALIBAN DECISION-MAKERS WHO WILL DECIDE NEXT STEPS ARE MILITARY COMMANDER BORJAN, AND POLITICAL LEADERS MULLAH MOHAMMED RABBANI AND MULLAH ABDUL RAZAK.  4.  (C) HAJI BASHIR, WHO HAD RECENTLY RETURNED FROM JALALABAD, SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SEIZED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES IN THEIR TAKEOVER OF NANGARHAR PROVINCE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE TALIBAN HAD CAPTURED OVER 150 TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.  ACCORDING TO HAJI BASHIR, THE SEIZURE OF THESE ITEMS, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, MEANT THAT TALIBAN SUPPLY LINES HAD BEEN SHORTENED, AND THEY DID NOT NOW HAVE TO SEND FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FROM KANDAHAR.  HE ADDED THAT JALALABAD AIRPORT IS IN GOOD CONDITION; AN AN-32 FROM KANDAHAR ARRIVED THERE ON SEPTEMBER 17.  (NOTE:  AS REPORTED SEPTEL, JALIL AND HAJI BASHIR ALSO SAID TERRORIST TRAINING BASES IN PAKTIA PROVINCE HAD BEEN CAPTURED, ALTHOUGH THE "ARAB" OCCUPANTS OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED.  THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.  END NOTE.)  ----------------------------- RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM WARM... -----------------------------  5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS THAT GENERAL DOSTAM PLANS TO SEND 2,000 SOLDIERS TO KABUL TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE TALIBAN (REF B), JALIL WAS DISMISSIVE, AND EMPHATIC THAT RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE "WARM."  HE SAID HE DOUBTED THAT DOSTAM WOULD EVER ENTER INTO ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMANDER MASOOD, WHOM HE DOES NOT TRUST.  JALIL ALLOWED THAT THE TALIBAN WERE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING DOSTAM'S ACTIVITIES, BUT WERE CONVINCED AS OF THIS POINT THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO TAKE ANY "AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS" AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  ---------------------------------------- BUT THE IRANIANS ARE STIRRING UP TROUBLE ----------------------------------------  6.  (C) HOWEVER, JALIL EVINCED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE IRANIANS WERE TRYING TO PUSH DOSTAM TOWARD AN ANTI-TALIBAN ALLIANCE WITH THE KABUL REGIME.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, JALIL SAID THE TALIBAN KNEW THAT IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ALLAHUDDIN BORUJERDI IS CURRENTLY IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF ADVOCATING SUCH AN INITIATIVE (REF A). HE DOUBTED THAT THE IRANIANS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS ENDEAVOUR, BUT THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP TRYING.  7.  (C) HAJI BASHIR RELATED THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE HAD BORDER FLARE-UPS WITH THE IRANIANS IN THE LAST MONTH. TWICE, HE ASSERTED, IRANIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ENTERED AFGHAN TERRITORY AND PROCEEDED TO THE AFGHAN BORDER TOWN OF ISLAM QALA, WHERE THEY ENCOUNTERED TALIBAN RESISTANCE. IN ONE INCIDENT, HE RECOUNTED, SIX UNIFORMED IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF AFGHANISTAN.  HAJI BASHIR SAID THE IRANIANS WERE LATER RELEASED WHEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO PREVENT SUCH INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. NONETHELESS, JALIL NOTED, TEHERAN RADIO'S PASHTU AND DARI SERVICES CONTINUED TO PRESS AN ANTI-TALIBAN MESSAGE, WHICH INCLUDED ALLEGATIONS THAT THE TALIBAN ARE WORKING FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  ------------------------- ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME -------------------------  8.  (C) JALIL SAID THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT TAKE THE SEPTEMBER 12 STATEMENT OF FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH THAT HE WAS WILLING TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN VERY SERIOUSLY.  FOR ONE THING, HE SAID THE FORMER KING IS JUST TOO OLD.  IN ADDITION, NONE OF THE FACTIONS REALLY SUPPORTED THE FORMER KING, ALTHOUGH SOME--LIKE DOSTAM--CLAIMED THAT THEY DID.  THE BASIC POINT, JALIL CONTINUED, IS THAT AS FAR AS THE TALIBAN ARE CONCERNED THEY ALREADY HAVE A LEADER, AMIR MOHAMMED OMAR, AND DO NOT NEED ANOTHER ONE.  ------------------------------- UN SPECIAL MISSION SEEN AS WEAK -------------------------------  9.  (C) JALIL WAS ALSO DISMISSIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UN SPECIAL MISSION ON AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA).  HE SAID THE NEW SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, DR, NORBERT HOLL, "KEPT PROMISING SOLUTIONS TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT BUT FAILED TO PRODUCE ANYTHING."  JALIL WAS ADAMANT THAT THE TALIBAN "WANT TO WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS," BUT SAID THEY SUSPECT THE UN IS "PRO-KABUL" AND ANTI-TALIBAN.  JALIL INVITED UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP IN JALALABAD AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, NOTING THAT THE SITUATION WAS "SAFE" THERE.  HE WARNED UNSMA IN THE STRONGEST TERMS NOT TO SET UP ITS AFGHAN HEADQUARTERS IN KABUL IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN "A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION" WITH THE TALIBAN.  POLOFF AND AARMA TOLD JALIL THAT IT WAS IN THE TALIBAN'S OWN BEST INTEREST TO ENGAGE UNSMA IN A "COOPERATIVE SPIRIT" SINCE IT WAS WORKING FOR PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  (COMMENT:  RECENTLY STEPHEN EVANS (PROTECT), ONE OF DR. HOLL'S ADVISERS, OPINED TO POLOFF THAT KABUL WOULD BE THE ONLY LOGICAL PLACE FOR UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP--"JALALABAD IS NO LONGER NEUTRAL, SO ONLY THE CAPITAL REMAINS."  END COMMENT.)  -------------------------------- RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES --------------------------------  10.  (C) JALIL CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES BASED ON ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TWO ALSO SHARED A COMMON INTEREST IN HALTING IRANIAN "AGGRESSION," AND HE URGED USG SUPPORT FOR THE TALIBAN NOW THAT THEY CONTROL TWO-THIRDS OF AFGHANISTAN.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT THE USG DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY OF THE FACTIONS, BUT RATHER SUPPORTS THE FORMATION OF A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS SPIRIT, THE USG WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE TALIBAN WHENEVER POSSIBLE, POLOFF NOTED.  ------- COMMENT -------  11.  (C) JALIL PROVIDED NO HINT THAT THE TALIBAN INTEND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH UNSMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN ADDITION, JALIL APPEARED QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN WOULD REJECT THE FORMER KING'S OFFER TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN.  THIS LEAVES ONLY A CONTINUATION OF WAR--AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM, AND JALIL PROVIDED EVERY SIGNAL THAT THE TALIBAN ARE AIMING FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT.  12.  (C) IN THE WAKE OF THE TALIBAN'S MILITARY SUCCESSES, JALIL'S REMARKS ALSO INDICATE GROWING TENSION BETWEEN KANDAHAR AND TEHRAN.  IF THE TALIBAN CARRY THEIR OFFENSIVE CLOSER TO KABUL, THIS TENSION COULD GROW.   SIMONS

(C) SUMMARY:  THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER TOLD POLOFF AND AARMA ON SEPTEMBER 18 THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SEIZED HEKMATYAR/SAYYAF TRAINING CAMPS IN PAKTIA PROVINCE.  HE NOTED THAT THE "ARAB" OCCUPANTS OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED, AND HE DID NOT KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.  SEPTEMBER 19 PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT 107 "PAKISTANIS" RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING IN THE KHOST AREA OF AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AFTER ENTERING PAKISTAN.  END SUMMARY.  3.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF AND AARMA ON SEPTEMBER 18, MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR'S ADVISER, SAID THE TALIBAN CAPTURED TRAINING CAMPS RUN BY THE HEKMATYAR AND SAYYAF FACTIONS DURING THEIR SEIZURE OF PAKTIA PROVINCE IN LATE AUGUST AND EARLY SEPTEMBER.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE CAMPS CONTAINED LARGE AMOUNTS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.  4.  (C) JALIL CLAIMED THAT ALL OF THE "ARABS" BEING TRAINED IN THESE CAMPS HAVE FLED TO AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE KABUL REGIME.  ASKED ABOUT THE WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN, HE RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT HE WAS NOT IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN.  5.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA URGED JALIL TO ENSURE THAT THE TALIBAN TAKES MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THESE CAMPS ARE NOT REACTIVATED AND THAT NO FORM OF "SAFE HAVEN" IS EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS.  IN ADDITION, POLOFF AND AARMA EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TALIBAN PUT OUT THE WORD THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN'S PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT WANTED.  JALIL REPLIED THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM IN ANY FORM AND WOULD NOT PROVIDE REFUGE TO OSAMA BIN LADEN.  6.  (C) SEPTEMBER 19 PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT "AS MANY AS 107 PAKISTANIS WHO WERE RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING AT TWO CAMPS IN AFGHANISTAN'S KHOST PROVINCE WERE CAUGHT ON THE PAKISTAN-AFGHAN BORDER WHILE RETURNING HOME AFTER THE SEIZURE OF THEIR CAMPS BY THE TALIBAN." ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, THE GOP BORDER FORCES TOOK THOSE ARRESTED TO DERA ISMAIL KHAN PRISON IN NORTH WAZIRSTAN AGENCY.  7.  (C) COMMENT:  JALIL MADE ALL THE RIGHT SOUNDS CONCERNING TERRORISM, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE COUNTERTERRORISM POINTS HOME IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TALIBAN.  WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF THE PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS CITED IN PARA FIVE, BUT INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR TOLD THE DCM ON SEPTEMBER 12 THAT HE HAD ISSUED AN ORDER TO GOP BORDER FORCES TO ARREST TERRORISTS IF THEY TRIED TO ENTER PAKISTAN (REFTEL).

(C) ABDUL BAQI, AN AFGHAN BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF AND THE ASSISTANT ARMY ATTACHE (AARMA) ON OCTOBER 11 THAT FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD "UNDER TALIBAN CONTROL."  BAQI SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THIS FROM A TALIBAN SOURCE IN JALALABAD "TEN DAYS AGO" WHO HAD "PERSONALLY" SEEN BIN LADEN.  BAQI ADDED THAT BIN LADEN IS BEING "SHELTERED" IN COMMANDER YUNIS KHALIS' COMPOUND IN JALALABAD.  KHALIS IS ALSO PROVIDING SHELTER TO A NUMBER OF OTHER "ARABS," ACCORDING TO BAQI.  ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THAT BIN LADEN WAS STILL IN JALALABAD, BAQI SAID THAT HE FELT THAT HE STILL IS.  4.  (C) BAQI STRESSED THAT THE TALIBAN ARE "NOT AT ALL FRIENDLY" TOWARD BIN LADEN AND THE OTHER "ARABS."  HE ASSERTED THAT BIN LADEN WAS NOT "FREE TO COME AND GO AS HE PLEASED" AND THAT THE TALIBAN WOULD NOT "ALLOW HIM TO PLAN TERRORIST ATTACKS" WHILE HE IS UNDER THEIR CONTROL.  BAQI NOTED THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE NOT DECIDED WHAT TO DO WITH BIN LADEN AND THE OTHER "ARABS."  5.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF AND AARMA ON OCTOBER 13, AFGHAN CHARGE ABDUL WAHAB AVERRED THAT HE IS "UNAWARE OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF BIN LADEN, ALTHOUGH HE COULD BE RECEIVING SHELTER SOMEWHERE IN AFGHANISTAN." WAHAB, WHO IS A MEMBER OF KHALIS' POLITICAL PARTY, HIZB-I-ISLAMI (KHALIS), ADDED THAT IT IS "PART OF AFGHAN CUSTOM TO OFFER HOSPITALITY AND REFUGE TO STRANGERS, BUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED BY THE TALIBAN."  ASKED ABOUT THE WHEREABOUTS OF YUNIS KHALIS, WAHAB SAID THAT HE IS AT HIS HOME IN JALALABAD.  6.  (C) BOTH POLOFF AND AARMA TOLD WAHAB TO URGE THE TALIBAN NOT TO PROVIDE ANY FORM OF "SAFE HAVEN" TO TERRORISTS.  IN ADDITION, POLOFF AND AARMA EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TALIBAN TELL OSAMA BIN LADEN THAT HIS PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT WANTED.  7.  (C) COMMENT:  WE CANNOT VERIFY BAQI'S ASSERTION THAT BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT BIN LADEN AND OTHER ARABS WERE SWEPT UP IN THE CONFUSION CAUSED BY THE RAPID TALIBAN ADVANCE LAST MONTH, AND ARE NOW IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN.   SIMONS

TAYYAB HUSSAINI, A GOOD CONTACT AT THE AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS AND NOTED THAT OMAR'S COMMENTS DID NOT REPRESENT A SHIFT IN TALIBAN POLICY TOWARD BIN LADEN, BUT WERE A "WARNING."  SAUDI EMBASSY POLOFF HAMZA GASSAS TOLD POLOFF THAT OMAR'S COMMENTS COULD MEAN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BIN LADEN'S ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY.  OMAR MEETS BIN LADEN --------------------/  3.  (U) PAKISTANI NEWSPAPERS REPORTED ON MARCH 27 THAT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN LEADER, MET WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN, EX-SAUDI FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER OF RADICAL ISLAMIC CAUSES, IN KANDAHAR ON MARCH 25 TO INFORM HIM OF "THE CONCERN OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES" IN AFGHANISTAN.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, OMAR THEN TOLD BIN LADEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT USE "AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES."   HE ALSO REPORTEDLY TOLD BIN LADEN THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT U.S. FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED THERE.  ONE OF THE ARTICLES GOES ON TO NOTE THAT THE TALIBAN DELEGATION TO THE MARCH 23 OIC SUMMIT IN ISLAMABAD HAD MET WITH THE SAUDI DELEGATION AND BEEN INFORMED OF SAUDI CONCERNS ABOUT BIN LADEN.  EMBOFF SAYS TALIBAN HAVE NOT CHANGED POLICY ON BIN LADEN --------------------------------------------- -----------/  4.  (C) ON MARCH 27, POLOFF MET WITH TAYYAB HUSSAINI, SECOND SECRETARY AT THE TALIBAN-CONTROLLED AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, AND ASKED HIM TO COMMENT ON THE ARTICLES.  HUSSAINI, WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO TALIBAN OFFICIALS IN KANDAHAR EARLIER IN THE DAY, CONFIRMED THAT THE ARTICLES ARE ACCURATE:  "MULLAH OMAR SUMMONED BIN LADEN FROM JALALABAD AND REQUESTED A MEETING WITH HIM IN KANDAHAR BECAUSE HE IS CONCERNED THAT BIN LADEN IS BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS."  HUSSAINI DID NOT DIVULGE WHAT BIN LADEN HAD SAID THAT HAD AROUSED TALIBAN CONCERN.  (NOTE:  BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS IN RECENT WEEKS IN WHICH HE ATTACKED SAUDI ARABIA AND THE U.S.)  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI WHETHER THE TALIBAN DELEGATION HAD MET WITH SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES AT THE RECENT OIC SUMMIT.  HUSSAINI REPLIED THAT MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE TALIBAN DELEGATION AND CHIEF OF THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL" IN KABUL, HAD MET WITH A SAUDI OFFICIAL NAMED "NAYIF," BUT DENIED THAT THE QUESTION OF BIN LADEN HAD BEEN RAISED.  (NOTE:  WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HUSSAINI WAS REFERRING TO NAYIF SAUD, THE SAUDI MINISTER OF INTERIOR;  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM LOCALLY WHETHER NAYIF SAUD WAS A MEMBER THE SAUDI DELEGATION.)  5.  (C) HUSSAINI ALSO TOLD US THAT NOT TOO MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO OMAR'S REMARKS; "THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY SHIFT IN POLICY BY THE TALIBAN.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HIM (BIN LADEN) SHELTER, BUT HE MUST ABIDE BY OUR RULES."  (NOTE:  THE TALIBAN HAVE TOLD EMBOFFS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT BIN LADEN CAN STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN "TERRORIST ACTIVITIES" WHILE THERE.)  HUSSAINI ADDED THAT BIN LADEN SHOULD CONSIDER OMAR'S COMMENTS A "WARNING."  MEETING WITH SAUDI DIPLOMAT ---------------------------/  6.  (C) IN A MARCH 27 MEETING WITH POLOFF, HAMZA GASSAS, A POLITICAL OFFICER AT THE SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY, STATED THAT HE IS "UNSURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF OMAR'S COMMENTS."  SOME OF THE PRESS ARTICLES INDICATED THAT THE TALIBAN ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BIN LADEN, WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE, HE CONTINUED.  HOWEVER, OMAR'S COMMENTS THAT U.S. TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA WERE OF CONCERN, HE RELATED.  QUERIED WHETHER A TALIBAN DELEGATION HAD IN FACT MET WITH SAG REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MARGINS OF THE OIC SUMMIT, GASSAS RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT DID NOT THINK THAT THEY HAD MET WITH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHO HEADED THE SAUDI DELEGATION.  GASSAS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER NAYIF SAUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION, AND CONCLUDED BY PROMISING TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE FURTHER.  COMMENT -------/  7.  (C) BASED ON HUSSAINI'S COMMENTS AND THE PRESS REPORTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT BIN LADEN'S RECENT ACTIVITIES AND THE REACTION THEY ARE PROVOKING FROM THE SAUDIS AND/OR THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE FEELING THE HEAT ON THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY FROM THE SAUDIS, AS SOME OF THE PRESS STORIES HERE SUGGEST.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROBE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEARN WHO SAID WHAT TO WHOM ON THIS ISSUE.   SIMONS

(C) NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER.  HE COMES FROM A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KANDAHAR AND HIS FAMILY, WHILE RESPECTED, DID NOT BELONG TO THE AFGHAN ELITE.  A SMALL-TIME COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE, HE FORMED THE TALIBAN IN LATE 1994 AS A REACTION AGAINST "IMMORAL" LOCAL COMMANDERS.  HE RARELY APPEARS IN PUBLIC AND DOES NOT MEET WITH MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  THOSE WHO HAVE MET HIM SAY HE IS A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND LIVES IN SPARTAN SURROUNDINGS.   ALTHOUGH HIS POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE, MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT OMAR PLAYS THE KEY, AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING. END SUMMARY.  ----------------- NOT MUCH BIO-DATA -----------------  4.  (C) SHORTLY AFTER THE TALIBAN SEIZED KABUL IN SEPTEMBER 1996, THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT ANNOUNCED THAT MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER, WOULD SERVE AS THE HEAD OF THEIR "ISLAMIC STATE OF AFGHANISTAN."  IN THIS CAPACITY, HIS TITLE REMAINS "AMIR AL-MU'MININ" ("COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL"), WHICH A TALIBAN-CONVENED GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONFERRED ON HIM IN APRIL 1996 IN KANDAHAR CITY.  OMAR, WHO IS APPROXIMATELY 38, IS FROM THE MAIWAND DISTRICT OF KANDAHAR PROVINCE AND IS A MEMBER OF THE HOTAK SUB-TRIBE OF THE GHILZAI TRIBE (REF C).  OMAR WAS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR, WHO MAINTAINED AFFILIATIONS WITH HEZB-I-ISLAMI (KHALIS) AND HARAKAT-I- INQILAB-ISLAMI (MOHAMMEDI).  HE LOST HIS RIGHT EYE IN THE WAR. AFTER THE FALL OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN 1992, OMAR, WHO REPORTEDLY HAS TWO WIVES, RETURNED TO A MADRASSA, WHICH HE HAD ATTENDED IN HIS YOUTH, IN HIS HOME VILLAGE OF SANGASAR, NEAR KANDAHAR CITY.  IT WAS FROM THIS VILLAGE THAT MULLAH OMAR AND FELLOW TALIBS, ANGERED ABOUT THE "IMMORAL BEHAVIOR" OF LOCAL COMMANDERS, BEGAN THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT IN THE FALL OF 1994.  5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT OMAR'S BACKGROUND, HAMID KARZAI, THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE LARGE POPALZAI TRIBE, TOLD POLOFF MARCH 22 THAT OMAR CAME FROM A FAMILY LOCALLY RESPECTED FOR ITS RELIGIOUS PIETY, BUT NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS:  "OMAR'S FATHER WAS A LOCAL RELIGIOUS LEADER, BUT THE FAMILY WAS POOR AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO POLITICAL LINKS IN KANDAHAR OR KABUL.  THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AFGHANS AND WERE DEFINITELY NOT MEMBERS OF THE ELITE." AGREEING WITH KARZAI'S ASSESSMENT, HAMED GAILANI, SON OF PIR GAILANI AND A LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OF AFGHANISTAN (NIFA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT "OMAR IS ADMIRED BY THE TALIBAN FOR THREE REASONS:  HIS RELIGIOUS PIETY, HIS REPUTATION FOR INCORRUPTIBILITY, AND HIS BRAVERY IN THE JIHAD.  BECAUSE OF THESE QUALITIES, HE IS CONSIDERED LIKE A TEACHER, A GUIDE."  ---------------------- FEW PUBLIC APPEARANCES ----------------------  6.  (C) MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR IS RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC.  ONE OF THE FEW TIMES HE HAS MADE A PUBLIC APPEARANCE WAS IN APRIL, 1996, WHEN HE ACCEPTED THE AMIR AL-MU'MININ TITLE AND HELD THE "CLOAK OF THE PROPHET" (A KANDAHARI RELIC) IN FRONT OF A CROWD.  HE ALSO PERSONALLY INAUGURATED A TALIBAN-SPONSORED REFURBISHMENT OF THE MAUSOLEUM OF AHMAD SHAH DURRANI IN KANDAHAR.  WHETHER HE CHOOSES TO REMAIN SHROUDED IN SECRECY OR IS A GENUINE RECLUSE IS NOT CLEAR, BUT MULLAH MALANG, A FORMER RESISTANCE COMMANDER WHO KNOWS MANY OF THE TALIBAN LEADERS, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 26 THAT MULLAH OMAR HAS NO DESIRE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC PERSONALITY:  "WHAT YOU MUST REALIZE IS THAT OMAR IS TOTALLY INNER-DIRECTED.  HIS LEGITIMACY COMES FROM GOD AND NOT FROM THE PUBLIC; BECAUSE OF THIS, HE FEELS NO NEED TO EMERGE FROM HIS CHAMBERS. IN ADDITION, HE DOES NOT WANT TO MEET ANYONE WHO MAY DIVERT HIM FROM HIS CHOSEN COURSE."  -------------------------------- A RELUCTANCE TO MEET NON-MUSLIMS --------------------------------  7.  (C) MALANG'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO GET TO KNOW MULLAH OMAR:  HE DOES NOT MEET MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HE HAS MET WITH NON-MUSLIMS ONLY TWO TIMES:  HE MET UNICEF AFGHAN REPRESENTATIVE JIM MOHAN IN 1996 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AND AGAIN IN 1996 HE MET (BRIEFLY) WITH A RUSSIAN DELEGATION SEEKING THE RELEASE OF MEMBERS OF A RUSSIAN AIRCREW WHICH WAS CAPTURED AND DETAINED BY THE TALIBAN FROM 1995 TO 1996. FRANCIS OKELO, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE UN SPECIAL MISSION FOR AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 21 THAT UN SPECIAL ENVOY HOLL (A NON-MUSLIM GERMAN) HAS REQUESTED MEETINGS WITH OMAR ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND BEEN TURNED DOWN EVERY TIME.  ASKED WHETHER THE UNSMA HAD EVER RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TALIBAN, OKELO REPLIED THAT "THEY BASICALLY TELL US THAT HE IS ALWAYS BUSY AND INTIMATE THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE TO MEET WITH NON-MUSLIMS."  IN ADDITION, UNOCHA COORDINATOR ALFREDO WITSCHI-CESTARI (A NON-MUSLIM) RECENTLY EXPRESSED OPTIMISM TO THE DCM THAT HIS REQUEST TO MEET WITH OMAR IN KANDAHAR TO EXPLAIN UN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/ DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD BE GRANTED.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.)  ------------------ A MAN OF FEW WORDS ------------------  8.  (C) THOSE WHO HAVE MET MULLAH OMAR REMARK THAT HE IS A MAN OF DECIDEDLY FEW WORDS, AND ONE WHO KEEPS TO SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS.  ON MARCH 21, IBRAHIM BAKR, THE OIC SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN, TOLD DCM THAT HE HAD MET OMAR ON MARCH 15 TO REQUEST LENIENCE FOR TWO JAILED FRENCHMEN HELD IN KABUL BY THE TALIBAN ON VAGUE CHARGES OF IMMORALITY.  (NOTE:  AFTER A BRIEF TRIAL, THE FRENCHMEN WERE RELEASED ON MARCH 19.)  BAKR DESCRIBED THE MEETING:  "I EXPLAINED WHY I THOUGHT THE FRENCHMEN SHOULD BE RELEASED AND AT THE END OF MY COMMENTS MULLAH OMAR SAID 'THANK YOU.  WE WILL CONSIDER THAT.'" BAKR ADDED THAT OMAR'S OFFICE (WHICH APPARENTLY DOUBLED AS HIS BEDROOM) WAS SPARSE AND DIMLY LIT.  THE ONLY FURNITURE WAS A CHARPOY (SIMPLE WOODEN BED) AND A WARDROBE.  GUESTS SAT ON THE FLOOR, LOOKING UP AT OMAR, WHO SAT ON THE CHARPOY.  ANOTHER PERSON WHO MET OMAR, IFTIKHAR MURSHED, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (AFGHANISTAN) AT THE PAKISTANI MFA, TOLD US DECEMBER 15 THAT, DURING A DECEMBER 8 DELEGATION VISIT TO KANDAHAR, A PAKISTANI DELEGATION MET OMAR AND IN THAT MEETING "THE PAKISTANIS SPOKE FOR THE FIRST 85 MINUTES AND OMAR FOR THE LAST FIVE."   IN THIS MEETING (REF B), MURSHED RECOUNTED THAT THE GIST OF OMAR'S COMMENTS WERE, "I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE COME; I HAVE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY."  (NOTE:  MURSHED HAS ALSO TOLD DCM THAT THE PAKISTANI CONSUL GENERAL IN KANDAHAR HAS EASY ACCESS TO OMAR.")  IN DESCRIBING HIS MEETING WITH OMAR, UNICEF REPRESENTATIVE MOHAN SAID HE DID ALL THE SPEAKING AND RECEIVED LITTLE REACTION FROM OMAR.  ----------------------------- POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE -----------------------------  9.  (C) THE LIMITED ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE PROVIDES LITTLE INFORMATION ON MULLAH OMAR'S PERSONAL POLITICAL BELIEFS.  MOST OBSERVERS DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN "IKHWANI" OR "FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM" IN THE CLASSIC MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SENSE.  IN A MARCH 20 CONVERSATION, DR. GHAIRAT BAHEER, THE ISLAMABAD REPRESENTATIVE FOR HEZB-I-ISLAMI AND SON-IN-LAW OF ISLAMIC RADICAL GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR, COMMENTED THAT "OMAR IS TOO POORLY EDUCATED IN ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES TO BE AN IKHWANI; HE IS BASICALLY A FERVENT MUSLIM WITH OBSCURANTIST TENDENCIES WHOSE VIEWS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY HIS TRIBAL BACKGROUND."  INDEED, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT MULLAH OMAR IS AN ISLAMIC RADICAL WITH AN ANTI-WESTERN AGENDA. HE HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE ANTI-WESTERN STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH HE IS KNOWN TO BE ANTI-RUSSIAN BECAUSE OF THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR. HOWEVER, WE RECENTLY HEARD ONE COMMENT THAT INDICATES THAT OMAR MAY HAVE SOME ANTAGONISM TOWARD THE WEST:  ABDUL HADI, THE TALIBAN DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF ZABUL PROVINCE AND THEIR (SELF-DESCRIBED) CHOICE FOR GOVERNOR OF WARDAK PROVINCE, TOLD DCM ON MARCH 17 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A MEETING MARCH 1 IN WHICH OMAR HAD DEFENDED THE TALIBAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN -- "OMAR TOLD US THAT WE HAVE TO HELP BIN LADEN BECAUSE HE IS A GOOD, ISLAMIC PERSON, WHO IS FIGHTING THE KAFFIRS (UNBELIEVERS)."  (NOTE:  SEE REF A ON A MARCH 25 MEETING BETWEEN OMAR AND FUGITIVE EX-SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.)  -------------------------------------------- TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING:  OMAR AND THE SHURA --------------------------------------------  10.  (C) MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OMAR HAS A KEY, AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  THEY NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT VIRUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT TALIBAN EDICT ON SOCIAL ISSUES OR THE MILITARY SITUATION COMES OUT IN HIS NAME.  IN ADDITION, HE REPORTEDLY MAKES HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, A SECOND SECRETARY AT THE AFGHAN EMBASSY AND A TALIB, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 14 THAT "THE AMIR AL-MU'MININ HAS TOTAL CONTROL OF PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  OF COURSE, HE MAKES THESE DECISIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER SHURA MEMBERS."  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE OF OMAR'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE SHURA.  IN RESPONSE, HUSSAINI OBSERVED THAT POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE IN KANDAHAR AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL" IN KABUL, WHICH GIVES ORDERS TO TALIBAN PROVINCIAL CHIEFS.  SOMEWHAT CONFUSINGLY, HE THEN ADDED THAT BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS OMAR CONSULTS CLOSELY WITH MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL" AND MULLAH HASSAN, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL."  (FORMER COMMANDER RAHIM WARDAK, IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH THE DCM, ALSO INDICATED THAT OMAR CONSULTS WIDELY AMONG SENIOR TALIBAN OFFICIALS; HOWEVER, AFTER HEARING VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS, OMAR SOMETIMES COMES UP WITH A DECISION COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE EXPRESSED VIEWS AND THEN EXPECTS IMPLEMENTATION.  BASED ON WARDAK'S COMMENTS, ONE COULD CONCLUDE THAT OMAR WAS A BIT OF A "CONTROL FREAK.")  HIROSHI TAKAHASHI, AN UNSMA POLITICAL OFFICER, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 5 THAT HE THOUGHT THAT TWO OTHER KEY ADVISERS FOR OMAR ARE ANOTHER MULLAH HASSAN, THE GOVERNOR OF KANDAHAR AND FOUR NEIGHBORING PROVINCES, AND MULLAH JALIL, A TALIBAN "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER," WHO IS STATIONED IN KANDAHAR.  ------- COMMENT -------  11.  (C) WHILE REPORTS VARY OF HOW WILLING OR RELUCTANT MULLAH OMAR WAS TO ACCEPT THE TITLE "AMIR AL-MU'MININ" FROM THE ASSEMBLED TALIBAN IN KANDAHAR IN APRIL 1996, NEVERTHELESS HE DID ACCEPT IT. CREATED EARLY IN ISLAMIC HISTORY AND FIRST USED BY THE SECOND OF THE ORTHODOX CALIPHS, OMAR, THE TITLE HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY A SERIES OF MUSLIM POLITIES UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.  IN THE SUNNI ISLAMIC WORLD, THE ADOPTION OF THE TITLE IMPLIED THE CLAIM EITHER TO THE CALIPHATE OR TO AUTONOMOUS POLITICAL AUTHORITY OVER A REGION OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  NOT EVEN THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL TALIBAN CLAIM THAT OMAR WITH HIS TITLE IS A SUCCESSOR TO THE CALIPHATE, MOST RECENTLY HELD IN OTTOMAN TURKEY.  BUT, IN THE SECOND SENSE, THE TALIBAN ARE MOST CERTAINLY CLAIMING AUTHORITY OVER THE AFGHAN REGION OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  OMAR BUTTRESSED THIS CLAIM BY DISPLAYING "THE CLOAK OF THE PROPHET" WHEN HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF AMIR AL-MU'MININ. ALSO, IN MORE RECENT HISTORY, THE TITLE HAS HAD A STRONG IDEOLOGICAL RESONANCE AMONG SOME REFORMIST, MESSIANIC, AND MILITANT ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS, RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE CORRUPT AND IRRELIGIOUS WAYS OF THE EXISTING RULERS.  BESIDES THE TALIBAN, SOME OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON AFGHAN SOIL HAVE USED THIS TITLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A WAHHABI SECT WITH STRONG ARAB BACKING, MOST ACTIVE IN KUNAR PROVINCE, UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY CALLED ITS LEADER "AMIR AL-MU'MININ."  12.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO MANY OF THE HOLDERS OF THE TITLE IN CLASSICAL ISLAM OR TO MANY OF THE LAWLESS COMMANDERS THE TALIBAN OUSTED OR COOPTED, OMAR LIVES AUSTERELY, WITHOUT AN ELABORATE COURT AND ENTOURAGE, AND WITHOUT THE UBIQUITOUS PAJERO'S SO MANY MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS SPED AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE IN.  WHETHER OMAR'S ASCETIC LIFESTYLE IS BASED SOLELY ON HIS TEMPERAMENT OR IS COLDLY CALCULATED TO SET HIM AND HIS MOVEMENT APART FROM THE DISCREDITED MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS AND LEADERS THE TALIBAN REPLACED, MANY AFGHANS REACT APPROVINGLY.  SO FAR, NO PERSONALITY CULT OR EMPEROR SYNDROME APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND MULLAH OMAR.  13.  (C) OMAR, AS REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS SUGGESTS, MAY BE ADOPTING INCREASINGLY HARDLINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE WEST AND ISSUES ABOUT WHICH THE U.S. IS CONCERNED (NARCOTICS, TERRORISM). WHAT IS MOTIVATING THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS:  GENUINE IDEOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS, A GROWING RESENTMENT THAT THE WEST HAS NOT ACCEPTED THE TALIBAN AS A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT, A BAZAAR BARGAINING ATTITUDE, FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SQUEEZES ON THE TALIBAN, OUTSIDERS' ADVICE, OR SOME OTHER FACTOR COULD ALL PLAY A ROLE.  14.  (C) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE EMBASSY HAS ASKED WHETHER A MEETING WITH OMAR MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, BUT NOTHING HAS EVER COME OF IT.  THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT U.S. VIEWS GET THROUGH TO OMAR ACCURATELY, GIVEN HIS KEY ROLE IN THE TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  AT THIS POINT, BASED ON THE TALIBAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND DETERMINATION TO END THE CONFLICT BY MILITARY MEANS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF HE IS HEARING OUR MESSAGE FROM OTHER HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN AND FROM U.S. PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HE IS NOT LISTENING TO IT.

(U) CLASSIFIED BY DAN MOZENA, ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR. REASONS:  1.5 (C) (D).  2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, HAMED GAILANI, THE POLITICALLY-ACTIVE SON OF PIR GAILANI, AND MULLAH MALANG, AN AFGHAN WITH LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY THAT "RADICALS" ARE GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN THE TALIBAN.  THEY PICTURE THE "RADICALS" AS BEING STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE TALIBAN'S POLICY OF OFFERING SAFE HAVEN TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN.  THEY ADDED THAT SOME OF THE "RADICALS," INCLUDING "JUSTICE MINISTER" TURABI AND HIGH- LEVEL TALIBAN ADVISER WAKIL AHMED, WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO MULLAH MANSOUR, A STRONGLY ISLAMIST RESISTANCE LEADER, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1992.  END SUMMARY.  "RADICALS" SEEN AS GAINING THE UPPER HAND -----------------------------------------/  3.  (C) IN AN APRIL 12 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, HAMED GAILANI, THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, SAID HE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF "RADICALS" HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  IN A SEPARATE APRIL 14 CONVERSATION, MULLAH MALANG, A COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE WITH CLOSE LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD ALSO NOTED A "MORE EXTREME EDGE" TO THE TALIBAN, ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST MONTH.  BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG LISTED THE FOLLOWING TALIBAN LEADERS AS "RADICALS" WITH INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN THE MOVEMENT:  -- MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ADVISER TO TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR. -- MULLAH TURABI, THE "JUSTICE MINISTER." -- MULLAH MUTAQI, THE "INFORMATION MINISTER." -- MULLAH JALIL, THE "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER" IN KANDAHAR. -- SHER MOHAMMAD STANEKZAI, THE "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER" IN KABUL. -- MULLAH SIDDIQI, THE "ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE."  (NOTE:  SEE REF B FOR RECORD OF POLOFF'S RECENT MEETING WITH SIDDIQI, IN KABUL.)  STRONG PRO-BIN LADEN VIEWS --------------------------/  4.  (C) MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT ALL OF THESE TALIBAN OFFICIALS ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE TALIBAN'S POLICY OF PROVIDING SAFE HAVEN AND PROTECTION TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN.  IN PARTICULAR, HE NOTED, TURABI, WAKIL AHMED AND MUTAQI HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE PRO-BIN LADEN WING OF THE TALIBAN.  ON THE OTHER HAND, MALANG CONTINUED, ALTHOUGH MULLAH RABBANI, THE TALIBAN "CHIEF OF THE CARETAKER COUNCIL," AND MULLAH GHAUS, THE TALIBAN "FOREIGN MINISTER," ARE NOT AGAINST OFFERING HAVEN TO BIN LADEN, THEY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE TALIBAN OF BEING IDENTIFIED WITH BIN LADEN'S ANTI-SAUDI AND ANTI-AMERICAN POLICIES.  HOWEVER, MALANG ADDED, RABBANI AND GHAUS HAVE "LOST THE ARGUMENT" AND THE TALIBAN HAVE NO PLANS TO ADJUST THEIR POLICY ON BIN LADEN.  5.  (C) ASKED WHY BIN LADEN IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE "RADICALS," MALANG REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE RADICALS SEE BIN LADEN AS A "LEARNED MUSLIM," WHO CAN QUOTE FROM THE KORAN AND HADITHS (SAYINGS OF THE PROPHET).  IN ADDITION, THEY FEEL HE IS OWED RESPECT BECAUSE HE HELPED THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  FINALLY, MALANG OBSERVED, THE "RADICALS" ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDS THAT BIN LADEN PROVIDES THE TALIBAN.  THE "MANSOUR" GROUP -------------------/  6.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ASSERTED THAT MOST OF THE TALIBAN "RADICALS" WERE AFFILIATED WITH AN AFGHAN RESISTANCE PARTY LED BY NASRULLAH MANSOUR.  GAILANI TOLD POLOFF THAT MANSOUR WAS ORIGINALLY THE DEPUTY TO MOHAMMED NABI MOHAMMEDI, THE LEADER OF HARAKAT-I- INQILAB-I-ISLAMI (HII), BUT LEFT THE PARTY TO FORM A BREAKAWAY FACTION IN 1981.  THE ISSUE THAT LED TO THE HII SPLIT, ACCORDING TO GAILANI, WAS NABI'S BELIEF THAT MANSOUR HAD GROWN "TOO INTERNATIONALIST" IN HIS ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  HE NOTED THAT MANSOUR WAS ASSASSINATED BY UNITS LOYAL TO HEZB-I-ISLAMI (HEKMATYAR) IN 1992, AND ADDED THAT WAKIL AHMED, TURABI, AND SIDDIQI, IN PARTICULAR, ARE CONSIDERED "PROTEGES OF MANSOUR."  "MANSOURIS" SEEN AS LESS ANTI-IRANIAN" --------------------------------------/  7.  (C) NOTING THAT MANSOUR SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN IRAN IN THE 1980S, MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED "MANSOURIS" (AS SUPPORTERS OF MANSOUR ARE KNOWN) ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LESS ANTI-IRANIAN THAN OTHER TALIBAN.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, HE EXPLAINED THAT SINCE "MANSOURIS" ARE MORE ISLAMIST IN ORIENTATION AND LESS NATIONALISTIC, THEY DO NOT HOLD THE STRONG ANTI-IRANIAN BELIEFS COMMON TO OTHER AFGHANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE PASHTUNS FROM WESTERN PROVINCES LIKE KANDAHAR, HELMAND, URUZGAN, AND FARAH.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE PRO-IRANIAN, HE CONCLUDED, BUT SIMPLY THAT "MANSOURIS" ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO THE IRANIANS.  A TALIBAN "REFORM COMMISSION" -----------------------------/  8.  (C) NEITHER GAILANI NOR MALANG BELIEVED THAT THE TREND TOWARD WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE "RADICALIZATION" OF THE TALIBAN WOULD EBB IN THE NEAR-TERM.  BOTH NOTED THAT THAT THEY HAD HEARD THAT MULLAH TURABI WAS NAMED THE HEAD OF A "REFORM COMMISSION" BY TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR IN MARCH.  FROM THIS POSITION, MALANG COMMENTED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT MULLAH TURABI NOW MAINTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON PERSONNEL DECISIONS AND DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION.  IN ADDITION, SINCE IT WAS REPORTED THAT TURABI WAS CHOSEN FOR THE POST PERSONALLY BY MULLAH OMAR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE IS NOW, ALONG WITH MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ONE OF OMAR'S CLOSEST ADVISERS, HE STATED.  COMMENT -------/  9.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ARE KNOWLEGEABLE CONTACTS ON AFGHANISTAN; MALANG, IN PARTICULAR, APPEARS TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT TALIBAN PERSONALITIES AND DECISION-MAKING.  THEIR ASSERTION THAT "RADICALS" IN THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN GAINING INFLUENCE HAS BEEN REPEATED BY OTHER OBSERVERS, INCLUDING GENERAL PAYENDA, DOSTAM'S REPRESENTATIVE IN PAKISTAN (REF A).  BIN LADEN'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE PURPORTEDLY ASCENDANT "RADICALS" IS POTENTIALLY OF GREAT CONCERN, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS THAT BIN LADEN IS ABLE TO EXPAND HIS INFLUENCE ON THE TALIBAN.   SIMONS

(S)  EMBASSY IS WORKING ON GATHERING MORE INFORMATION ON THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL, BUT OFFERS THE FOLLOWING INITIAL READOUT TO ASSIST ANALYSTS.  ACCORDING TO MUSHTAQ WANI -- ALL PARTIES HURRIYAT CONFERENCE MEMBER AND KASHMIRI MILITANT LEADER -- THE JKIF WAS FORMED WHEN THE PRO- PAKISTAN IKHEWAN-UL-MUSLIMEEN GROUP SPLIT APART IN 1995.  WANI SAID THAT THE GROUP IS SMALL -- "LESS THAN 100 MEMBERS" -- BUT THAT IT IS QUITE ACTIVE IN INDIA.  TWO OF ITS MORE PROMINENT MEMBERS RECENTLY WERE ARRESTED IN NEPAL AND INDIA FOR POSSESSION OF THE EXPLOSIVE RDX, WANI SAID.  ASKED IF THE WORD "ISLAMIC" IN JKIF MEANT THE GROUP WAS ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS, WANI REPLIED NO.  WANI SAID MOST OF THE MEMBERS WERE "UNEDUCATED MEN" WHO CAME FROM KASHMIR.  2.  (S)  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS GLEANED FROM A 1996 REPORT HANDED TO POLOFF BY FIRST SECRETARY ROWAN LAXON (PROTECT) AT THE UK HIGH COMMISSION IN ISLAMABAD.  ANALYSTS MAY ALREADY HAVE THIS PARTICULAR REPORT, BUT WE OFFER IT HERE FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH: BEGIN TEXT:  " ACCORDING TO A J&K GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN, HILAL AHMED BEG, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE J&K ISLAMIC FRONT, WAS KILLED IN AN ENCOUNTER WITH J&K POLICE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SRINAGAR AROUND MIDNIGHT ON 16/17 JULY 1996.  BEG IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF SERIOUS TERRORIST ACTS COMMITTED AT THE START OF THE MILITANCY IN KASHMIR, INCLUDING THE MURDER OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF KASHMIR UNIVERSITY.  HIS DEATH FOLLOWS THAT OF SAJJAD KENU, THE FOUNDER OF THE JKIF, AND COULD LEAD TO THE DEMISE OF THE ORGANIZATION AS A SERIOUS FORCE IN THE MILITANCY."  END TEXT.  3.

REASON:  1.5 (C).  1.  (S)  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL (A) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF), POLOFF, ACCOMPANIED BY POL FSN, VISITED THE JKIF'S ISLAMABAD OFFICE ON SEPTEMBER 4.  MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THE JKIF WAS SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL, BUT POL FSN FINALLY MANAGED TO TRACK DOWN AN ISLAMABAD PHONE NUMBER (445699) FOR THE GROUP.  WHEN HE CALLED THE OFFICE, THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED REPEATEDLY ASKED IF THE CALL WAS BEING TAPED.  "IF SO, I WILL SPEAK MORE CLEARLY," HE SAID, EVEN AFTER BEING ASSURED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT BEING MONITORED.  2.  (S)  FINDING THE JKIF OFFICE WAS ALMOST AS DIFFICULT AS MAKING AN APPOINTMENT.  LOCATED IN THE CAPITAL CITY'S WESTERNMOST SUBURBS, THE GROUP'S HOUSE IS TUCKED INTO A NARROW ALLEY IN THE I/10-2 SECTOR (STREET 10, GALI (ALLEY) 27, HOUSE 1908).  POLOFFS WERE USHERED INTO THE HOUSE BY DR. HAIDER, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF.  HE IN TURN INTRODUCED BILAL BAIG, CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF, AND SYED ALI RAZA, WHOM HAIDER DESCRIBED AS THE PRESIDENT OF JKIF'S POLITICAL WING IN MUZAFFARABAD.  HAIDER, WHO HAILS FROM BARAMULLA DISTRICT OF INDIAN KASHMIR AND SAYS HE HAS A MEDICAL DEGREE, DID MOST OF THE TALKING DURING THE NEXT HOUR-AND- A-HALF, THOUGH RAZA DID SPEAK UP OCCASIONALLY, AND BAIG APPEARED TO BE FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION CLOSELY.  3.  (S)  HAIDER NEEDED LITTLE PROMPTING TO LAUNCH INTO A CONVOLUTED EXPLANATION OF THE GROUP'S HISTORY AND ITS PHILOSOPHY, MOST OF WHICH IS COVERED MORE COMPREHENSIBLY IN REFTELS B AND C.  HAIDER SAID THE GROUP BEGAN AS A PEACEFUL ORGANIZATION CALLED THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR STUDENTS' LIBERATION FRONT IN 1988 AND GRADUALLY METAMORPHOSED INTO THE JKIF OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  HAIDER SAID HIS OWN CONVERSION TO VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE IN APRIL 1992, WHEN HE WAS DETAINED AND TORTURED BY INDIAN TROOPS IN SRINAGAR.  ROLLING UP HIS PANTS LEG TO REVEAL SEVERAL UGLY GOUGES IN HIS SKIN, HAIDER SAID HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO ELECTRIC SHOCKS AND SEVERE BEATINGS WHILE IN CUSTODY.  SINCE THEN, HAIDER SAID, HIS ELDER BROTHER HAD BEEN KILLED AND HIS FAMILY HOME DESTROYED BY INDIAN TROOPS, WHILE HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE TO PAKISTAN IN 1994.  "HE TOO HAS SUFFERED," HAIDER SAID POINTING TO BAIG, WHO WAS SITTING IMPASSIVELY ACROSS THE ROOM.  BAIG'S SISTER-IN-LAW AND FATHER WERE KILLED BY INDIAN TROOPS, HAIDER CHARGED, AND HIS SISTER, FARADA BAHANJI, HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN NEW DELHI'S TIHAR JAIL FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER'S ACTIVITIES.  TO CAP OFF THIS LITANY OF ABUSE, HAIDER PRODUCED SEVERAL PHOTOS OF CORPSES, ALL OF WHOM ALLEGEDLY DIED AT THE HANDS OF INDIAN SECURITY FORCES.  ONE PHOTO PURPORTEDLY SHOWED THE REMAINS OF BAIG'S FAMILY HOME WITH A SNAPSHOT OF HIS SISTER SUPERIMPOSED ON IT.  4.  (S)  WHEN PRESSED TO ELABORATE ON THE GROUP'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, HAIDER DEFERRED TO RAZA, A YOUNG, THIN MAN WITH A FULL BEARD AND TURBAN.  RAZA SAID THE JKIF HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO FORMULATE A POLITICAL AGENDA AND THE FOCUS WAS STILL ON ARMED RESISTANCE TO INDIAN OCCUPATION OF KASHMIR.  THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE JKIF IS KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE, HE COMMENTED, BUT AFTER INDIAN TROOPS VACATE KASHMIR, THE GROUP WOULD THEN BE AMENABLE TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS, EVEN IF THAT MEANT A VOTE TO JOIN INDIA.  THE JKIF IS PRIMARILY A NATIONALIST MOVEMENT, RAZA CONTINUED, AND DOES NOT ESPOUSE A PARTICULARLY RADICAL BRAND OF ISLAM, DESPITE ITS NAME.  AT THIS POINT, HAIDER JUMPED IN AND ENDED THIS SEGMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BY EMBARKING ON A LONG, RAMBLING DISCOURSE ABOUT THE COMMON ROOTS OF JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, WHILE TAKING PAINS TO MENTION THAT THE JKIF WAS NOT AGAINST "ORDINARY HINDUS."  5.  (S)  TURNING TO THE GROUP'S MILITARY OPERATIONS, HAIDER SAID THE JKIF'S PRIMARY TARGETS ARE INDIAN REGULAR AND PARAMILITARY FORCES IN KASHMIR, THOUGH HE ADDED THAT "THOSE WHO COMPROMISE" WITH THE INDIANS WERE ALSO KILLED.  ASKED WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED "COMPROMISERS," HAIDER LISTED BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS IN THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR GOVERNMENT AS THE MAIN CULPRITS, BUT STATED THAT ANYONE WHO "BECOMES A HINDRANCE" WAS ALSO A POTENTIAL TARGET, INCLUDING MUSLIM COLLABORATORS.  HAIDER BECAME QUITE AGITATED WHEN DISCUSSING THOSE WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED ENEMIES, REPEATEDLY BARING HIS CHEST WHILE STATING THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE FOR KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE.  "I WOULD KILL THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IF I COULD," HE ASSERTED.  A FAVORITE METHOD OF ATTACKING INDIAN TROOPS IS SUICIDE BOMBINGS, HAIDER ASSERTED, "JUST LIKE HAMAS IN ISRAEL."  RDX IS THE EXPLOSIVE OF CHOICE, HE EXPLAINED, AND ATTACKS ARE CAREFULLY PLANNED AFTER TARGETS ARE CASED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. HAIDER WAS EVASIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT BOMBINGS OF NON-MILITARY TARGETS, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT THE JKIF WAS A TERRORIST GROUP.  6.  (S)  HAIDER ESTIMATED THE JKIF'S STRENGTH AT BETWEEN 500 AND 1,000 MILITANTS, DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR PEAK IN 1992, WHEN THE GROUP BOASTED 4,000 FIGHTERS.  THE INDIANS HAVE KILLED MORE THAN 2,000 JKIF FIGHTERS SINCE THEN, HAIDER ADMITTED, BUT HE SAID THE GROUP STILL FIELDED THE SECOND-LARGEST MILITANT FORCE IN KASHMIR AFTER THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN (NOTE:  ALMOST EVERY KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUP CLAIMS TO HAVE THE SECOND-LARGEST NUMBER OF FIGHTERS IN INDIAN KASHMIR, BUT ALL AGREE THAT THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN IS NUMBER ONE).  ROUGHLY 200 FIGHTERS ARE IN AZAD KASHMIR AT ANY GIVEN TIME, WHILE THE REST ARE OPERATING INSIDE INDIAN KASHMIR.  TRAINING TAKES PLACE IN CAMPS IN AZAD KASHMIR, HAIDER EXPLAINED, BUT HE DENIED THAT THE GROUP RECEIVED ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE PAKISTANI ARMY.  ALL OF THE JKIF'S FIGHTERS ARE KASHMIRIS, EITHER FROM AZAD OR INDIAN KASHMIR, HAIDER CLAIMED, THOUGH HE CONCEDED THAT "ONE OR TWO" AFGHANS COULD BE IN THE GROUP WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.  RECRUITS RANGE IN AGE FROM TEENAGERS TO MEN IN THEIR 40'S AND 50'S, AND ALL RECEIVE ONE TO TWO MONTHS TRAINING BEFORE BEING SENT ACROSS THE LINE-OF-CONTROL (LOC) INTO INDIAN KASHMIR.  CROSSING THE LOC IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, HAIDER SAID, THEREFORE THE SIZE OF INFILTRATING GROUPS IS KEPT SMALL -- NO MORE THAN 20 MEN -- SO THAT CASUALTIES ARE LIMITED IF THE GROUP IS CAUGHT IN AN INDIAN AMBUSH. HAIDER DENIED THAT PAKISTANI TROOPS PROVIDE COVERING FIRE FOR JKIF MILITANTS.  7.  (S)  COMMENT:  HAIDER SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUP AT OUR NEXT MEETING, WHILE BOTH HE AND BAIG, WHO HAD REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE U.S. VIEWED JKIF AS A TERRORIST OUTFIT (SOMETHING WHICH WE DID NOT BRING UP FOR FEAR OF PROVOKING AN ABRUPT END TO OUR VISIT).  USHERING US TO THE DOOR, HAIDER WHISPERED THAT HE WOULD ALSO SHARE WITH US "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" ABOUT THE APHC'S ACTIVITIES THE NEXT TIME WE MET.  OBVIOUSLY MUCH OF WHAT SAID BY THESE MEN WAS TAILORED TO FIT THE AUDIENCE, BUT WE OFFER IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, AND WE WILL ATTEMPT GLEAN MORE ABOUT THE GROUP AND THEIR ACTIVITIES IN FUTURE MEETINGS.

(U)  CLASSIFIED BY CDA ALAN EASTHAM, 1.5D.  2. (C)  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD SUMMONED P-5 CHIEFS OF MISSION ON A HALF-HOUR'S NOTICE APRIL 6 TO INFORM US OF THE "SUCCESSFUL TEST" OF THE "INDIGENOUS" GHAURI MISSILE, WHICH HE SAID HAD A 1,500 KM RANGE FOR A 700 KG PAYLOAD.  HALF HIS PRESENTATION WAS ON THE MISSILE; THE OTHER HALF WAS AN INDIA-CENTRIC JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE TESTING.  CHARGE' OFFERED AN INFORMAL IMMEDIATE REACTION IN PRIVATE, NOTING THAT THE TEST WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION FOR RESTRAINT MADE IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  END SUMMARY.  3.  (U)  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD CALLED IN THE AMBASSADORS OF RUSSIA, U.K. AND FRANCE AND THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN CHARGES ON APRIL 6.  FOLLOWING IS A DIGEST OF HIS PRESENTATION:  --  I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME TO INFORM YOU THAT AS A PART OF PAKISTAN'S INTEGRATED MISSILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, TODAY WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FLIGHT-TESTED THE SURFACE-TO-SURFACE "GHAURI" MISSILE IN THE HATF SERIES.  (COMMENT: AN ACCOMPANYING PRESS RELEASE CALLS THIS MISSILE THE "HATF-FIVE" (ROMAN NUMERAL HATF-V).  --  THIS MISSILE HAS A RANGE OF 1,500 KM AND A PAYLOAD OF 700KG.  --  THIS TEST REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD IN OUR INDIGENOUS MISSILE AND SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAMS.  WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS INDIGENOUS CAPABILITY THROUGH THE COMMITMENT OF PAKISTANI SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS.  --  WE DO NOT HAVE TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY REGARDING INDIAN FLIGHT TESTS.  INDIA HAS CONDUCTED 16 TESTS OF THE PAKISTAN-SPECIFIC PRITHVI MISSILE AND HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED IT ALONG OUR BORDERS. INDIA HAS ALSO TESTED THE AGNI MISSILE FOUR TIMES.  --  IN SPITE OF THE INDIAN PROVOCATIVE TESTS IN THEIR NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXERCISED EXTREME RESTRAINT. BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT PAKISTAN'S SECURITY.  --  LET ME REITERATE THAT PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW RESTRAINT. WE DO NOT WANT TO SPARK A NUCLEAR AND MISSILE ARMS RACE IN SOUTH ASIA.  --  WE HAVE ALREADY MADE FORMAL PROPOSALS TO INDIA FOR MUTUAL AND EQUITABLE RESTRAINT IN THE NUCLEAR AND MISSILE AREA WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY RESPONSE.  WE ARE PREPARED TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH INDIA ON NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE ISSUES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE, WHICH AS YOU KNOW REMAINS STALEMATED BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES.  --  ON OUR PART WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO OVERCOME THESE PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES;  WE HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  4.  (C)  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHERE THE TEST HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT; THE FS SAID "IN PAKISTAN, ON LAND."  SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP REVOLVED AROUND THE DIALOGUE WITH INDIA, WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OFFERING NOTHING NEW.  ACCOMPANYING PRESS RELEASE (FAXED TO SA/PAB) ADDS NOTHING TO WHAT IS REPORTED ABOVE.  5.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE GROUP SESSION, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ASKED TO SEE CHARGE' PRIVATELY TO DISCUSS ANOTHER MATTER.  IN HIS OFFICE, CHARGE' SAID THAT NEWS OF THIS TEST MAY BE TAKEN BADLY IN WASHINGTON, SINCE IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE U.S. BELIEVES THE DECISION TO TEST A NEW MISSILE COULD HAVE BEEN POSTPONED IN ORDER TO LET THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISH ITSELF.  HOW THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT IS UNPREDICTABLE.  6. (C) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY RESPONDED BY REITERATING THE POINTS CITED ABOVE ON INDIAN TESTS, ADDING THAT "NO ONE EVER SAID ANYTHING" ABOUT INDIAN MISSILE TESTING. CHARGE' SAID THAT OF COURSE IT WAS UP TO PAKISTAN HOW PAKISTAN TOOK CARE OF ITS OWN SECURITY, BUT FROM HIS RECOLLECTION IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE INDIANS HAD COMPLETED THE "TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION" PHASE OF AGNI TESTING.  THE DIFFICULTY OF MISSILE SYSTEMS WAS THEIR DESTABILIZING EFFECT IN TIMES OF TENSION.  ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TARIQ ALTAF QUICKLY ADDED THAT THE BJP PLATFORM CALLED FOR "INDUCTING" NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO INDIA'S FORCES, A POINT WHICH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY QUICKLY ENDORSED.  CHARGE' CLOSED THE SESSION BY SAYING THAT AS THE SECRETARY HAD SUGGESTED IN HER LETTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD ACCEPTED IN HIS REPLY, THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION DURING THE VISIT OF AMBASSADORS RICHARDSON AND INDERFURTH AND MR. RIEDEL.  7. (C) COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD USE AMBASSADOR KHOKHAR'S CALL ON ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH TODAY TO CONVEY MORE FORMAL REGRETS ABOUT PAKISTAN'S DECISION TO TEST THIS MISSILE, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY'S LETTER SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING RESTRAINT IN MISSILE TESTING.  (FYI, WE HAD A SUGGESTION FROM ANOTHER SENIOR PAKISTANI OVER THE WEEKEND THAT SOME AT LEAST THINK PAKISTAN DID EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN NOT TESTING BEFORE MARCH 23 AND IN NOT DISPLAYING THE MISSILE THAT DAY DURING THE PAKISTAN DAY PARADE.)  8. (C) NOTE ALSO THAT THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A "FLIGHT TEST," AND NOT/NOT AS INDUCTION OF THE MISSILE INTO PAKISTAN'S ARMED FORCES. THE PAKISTANIS VIEW THIS AS CATCHING UP TO THE INDIANS, SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO AGNI, AND NOT AS LEAPFROGGING THEIR MISSILE CAPABILITIES.   THE TIMING IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE BJP GOVERNMENT IN INDIA AND EXTREME PAKISTANI NERVOUSNESS ABOUT BJP PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE NUCLEAR AREA, SPECIFICALLY THE DECLARATIONS OF THE INTENTION TO "INDUCT" NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  THE PAKISTANIS DECIDED TO LAY DOWN A FIRM MARKER BOTH TO THE INDIANS AND THE PAKISTANI PUBLIC THAT PAKISTANI CAPABILITIES IN THIS FIELD ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  THIS TEST WILL PRESENT THE BJP- LED GOVERNMENT IN INDIA WITH A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE SECURITY FIELD AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF IN DELHI.   EASTHAM

ISLAMABAD 3446; B. ISLAMABAD 3358  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ALAN EASTHAM.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D).  1. (C) SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED COMPLAINED TO THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 8 ABOUT THE "ONE-SIDED VIEW" OF THE JUST-RELEASED USG REPORT ON TERRORISM, LAMENTING THAT INDIA WAS PORTRAYED MORE POSITIVELY THAN PAKISTAN.  ACKNOWLEDGING A RECENT RESPITE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 KILLINGS OF 22 PEOPLE IN AZAD KASHMIR -- REF B), SHAMSHAD URGED THE U.S. TO USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO STOP INDIAN SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.  CONCERNING THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP HAD CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED NOT TO RETALIATE, BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUCH RESTRAINT IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH INCIDENTS.  HE NOTED THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE, DIALOGUE WITH INDIA WOULD BE DIFFICULT, BUT HE SAID THE GOP NEVERTHELESS LOOKS FORWARD TO A SUMMIT MEETING WITH THE INDIANS IN COLOMBO IN JULY TO EXPLORE HOW TO PROCEED WITH THE DIALOGUE.  THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE GOP RESTRAINT IN THE WAKE OF THE "SHOCKING" EVENT OF APRIL 26/27 AND NOTED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD SHAMSHAD'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE LIMITLESS IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH TRAGIC INCIDENTS. SHIFTING TO AFGHANISTAN, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS ENHEARTENED BY THE TALIBAN AGREEMENT TO RELEASE 1000 TONS OF FOOD FOR BAMIYAN AND SAID ISLAMABAD IS PUSHING FOR A COORDINATORS' MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.  (SEE REF A FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENT POWER PROJECTS.) END SUMMARY  2. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR MAY 8 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RECENTLY-RELEASED USG REPORT, "PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM."  ACCORDING TO SHAMSHAD, THE REPORT GAVE A "ONE-SIDED VIEW" OF THE SITUATIONS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE PAKISTAN SECTION OF THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND THE HARAKAT-UL-ANSAR, WHILE THE INDIA SECTION EMPHASIZED THE MILITANCY IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, WHICH -- SHAMSHAD STRESSED -- IS ACTUALLY "AN INDIGENOUS FREEDOM STRUGGLE." HE DECRIED THAT THE REPORT REFERRED TO NUMEROUS BOMBINGS IN INDIA (ASCRIBED TO CROSS-BORDER SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM), WHILE THE REPORT MAKES NO MENTION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN, IN WHICH THE INDIANS HAVE HAD A ROLE, HE ADDED.  "WE EXPECTED THE USG TO UNDERTAKE AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE SITUATIONS IN BOTH COUNTRIES," HE LAMENTED.  "WASHINGTON," HE CONTINUED, "MUST USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO STOP GOI SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM." FINISHING HIS THOUGHT, SHAMSHAD NOTED THAT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN A "RESPITE" IN INDIAN-SUPPORTED TERRORISM IN PAKISTAN, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 SLAYINGS OF 22 KASHMIRIS IN AZAD KASHMIR (REF B).  3. (C) SHUFFLING NOTES, SHAMSHAD GAVE A VIRTUALLY VERBATIM REPEAT OF A MAY 4 BRIEFING GIVEN BY MFA ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (SOUTH ASIA) TARIQ ALTAF (AND ATTENDED BY POLOFF) ON THE KILLINGS IN AZAD KASHMIR.  DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT AS "VERY SERIOUS," SHAMSHAD SAID THE INCIDENT WAS THE FIRST "TRANS-LINE OF CONTROL" INCIDENT OF THAT NATURE -- "THE ATTACK ACROSS THE LOC VIOLATED THE SANCTITY OF THE LINE OF CONTROL, SOMETHING WHICH MUST BE RESPECTED."  PAKISTAN, HE SAID, HAS MADE A DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO RETALIATE TO REDUCE RISKS OF THE SITUATION "GETTING OUT OF CONTROL."  HE ADDED THAT THE INCIDENT HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC OPINION, AND THERE MUST BE AN IMMEDIATE END TO SUCH EVENTS, WARNING THAT IF THERE ARE MORE SUCH INCIDENTS, "PAKISTAN WOULD FIND IT HARD NOT TO RETALIATE."  OBSERVING THAT PAKISTAN CONDEMNS TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, SHAMSHAD DECLARED THAT THERE IS A "QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE" BETWEEN VIOLENT ACTS ON THE INDIAN SIDE -- "THERE'S A FREEDOM STRUGGLE UNDERWAY THERE" -- AND THE PAK SIDE, "WHERE THERE IS NO SUCH STRUGGLE."  4. (C) SHIFTING FOCUS, SHAMSHAD ASSERTED THAT "PAKISTAN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNE TIME TO PICK UP THE THREAD OF INDO-PAK DIALOGUE."  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT DELHI WOULD "ADOPT A SERIOUS ATTITUDE" TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESUMING THE DIALOGUE. DECLARING THAT THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED TO BE CONVINCED ON THE DIALOGUE, SHAMSHAD SAID THAT IN THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE "NO GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO CARRY ON THE TALKS."  SHAMSHAD OBSERVED THAT ISLAMABAD NEVERTHELESS IS "EARNESTLY LOOKING FORWARD" TO THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS' MEETING IN COLOMBO "TO EXPLORE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE."  HE SAID ISLAMABAD WOULD SEND INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS HIGH COMMISSION IN DELHI TO THIS EFFECT, BUT "ONLY AFTER THE CURRENT PUBLIC ATTITUDE SUBSIDES."  WASHINGTON, HE ADDED, CAN PLAY A ROLE IN KEEPING TEMPERS LOW.  RETURNING TO HIS THEME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, SHAMSHAD SAID WASHINGTON SHOULD AVOID TAKING PRO-INDIAN STANCES WHICH PROVOKE A PAKISTANI REACTION, ADDING THAT THE GOP "IS DOING ITS BEST" TO CONTROL THE PUBLIC REACTION TO THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED MTCR-RELATED SANCTIONS ON KHAN RESEARCH LABORATORIES.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE GOP SEEMED TO BE SUCCEEDING IN THAT REGARD AS THE REACTION HAS BEEN "MODEST."  5. (C) RESPONDING TO SHAMSHAD'S LENGTHY MONOLOGUE, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD CONVEY TO WASHINGTON THE GOP'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE TERRORISM REPORT.  DODGING THE AMBASSADOR'S SEVERAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHY THE ATTACKERS IN THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT FOCUSSED ON ONLY TWO FAMILIES, SHAMSHAD SAID THE KILLERS WANTED TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS "AN INSIDE JOB."  RESPONDING TO ANOTHER QUERY, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP WAS SURE THE ATTACKERS HAD COME FROM ACROSS THE LOC -- "WE HAVE INTERCEPTS THAT MAKE THAT CLEAR," HE NOTED.  TERMING THE INCIDENT "SHOCKING AND UNFORGIVABLE," THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE RESTRAINT THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXERCISED IN THE WAKE OF THE INCIDENT, ADDING THAT HE UNDERSTANDS SHAMSHAD'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE LIMITLESS IF SUCH INCIDENTS WERE REPEATED.  THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THAT THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION FOR THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE.  RETURNING YET AGAIN TO HIS THEME OF USG ONE-SIDEDNESS, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE KILLINGS, REITERATING THAT WASHINGTON DOES NOT MENTION THE INDIAN ROLE IN FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN PAKISTAN -- "FOR US THIS IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE," HE ADDED. WARMING TO THIS THEME, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THE REPORTED WASHINGTON DENIAL THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING SANCTIONING INDIA ON THE SAGARIKA MISSILE.  "BREAKTHROUGH ON AFGHANISTAN" -----------------------------  6. (C) TURNING TO THE RECENT AFGHANISTAN STEERING COMMITTEE TALKS IN ISLAMABAD BETWEEN THE TALIBAN AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, SHAMSHAD SAID THE TALKS HAD BEEN "A GOOD SUCCESS, A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH, THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS THAT THE SIDES SAT TOGETHER FACE-TO-FACE."  HE GAVE THE U.S. AND HIS OWN GOVERNMENT CREDIT FOR THE MEETINGS.  PAKISTAN'S DESIRE, HE ADDED, IS TO FACILITATE THE AFGHANISTAN DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND HE RECOUNTED PAK EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT THE TALKS.  HE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIVE DAYS OF TALKS HAD BEEN "INCONCLUSIVE," ONE SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED -- "PAKISTAN IS KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH ALL PARTIES." TAKING CREDIT FOR THE RECENT TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN PROVINCE, SHAMSHAD SAID THIS "MAKES QUITE CLEAR THAT IF YOU DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN, THEN YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING."  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT "MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING."  WHAT IS IMPORTANT, SHAMSHAD UNDERSCORED, IS HOW ONE DEALS WITH THE TALIBAN.  SCORING THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS NOW PUSHING FOR A "COORDINATORS' MEETING" BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES -- "PAKISTAN IS INTENSIFYING ITS EFFORTS TO GET THE TWO SIDES BACK TOGETHER SOON; WE MUST NOT LOSE THE MOMENTUM."  HE PROMISED TO KEEP THE AMBASSADOR FULLY INFORMED OF THE GOP'S PROGRESS ON THE AFGHANISTAN FRONT.  7. (C) NOTING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOP ON AFGHANISTAN, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING AS "A STEP FORWARD" RATHER THAN A BREAKTHROUGH.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE GOP'S CONTRIBUTION IN HELPING MAKE THE MEETING HAPPEN.  SHAMSHAD SAID NORTHERN LEADER PROFESSOR RABBANI HAD RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT ON ALLOWING 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN AND WAS NOW CONSULTING HIS ALLIANCE COLLEAGUES.  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE WAS "THE BIGGEST PROBLEM," TO WHICH THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE TALIBAN, TOO, HAD TROUBLES WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS.  SUPPORTING THE NOTION OF A COORDINATORS' MEETING, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. AND PAKISTAN ARE "ON THE SAME WAVE-LENGTH."  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED, IS THAT THE SIDES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AGREEMENT ON "NO MILITARY OFFENSIVES."  ALL SIDES, HE UNDERSCORED, MUST STAY FOCUSSED ON THIS ESSENTIAL POINT.  8. (C) DREDGING UP AN OLD THEME, SHAMSHAD CALLED FOR AN ARMS EMBARGO ON AFGHANISTAN AND ASSERTED THAT PAKISTAN IS READY TO COOPERATE ON THIS.  HE SAID ISLAMABAD IS "SURPRISED" THAT THE SIX PLUS TWO PROCESS IS "SO CASUAL" ON THE NEED FOR AN EMBARGO. RESPONDING, THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE LAKHDAR BRAHIMI AS SAYING THAT IF PAKISTAN AND IRAN AGREE TO CUT OFF ARMS, THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AN EMBARGO, AND, WITHOUT PAK- IRANIAN AGREEMENT, AN EMBARGO WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.  9. (C) COMMENT:  THIS MEETING WAS VINTAGE SHAMSHAD, WHO DUTIFULLY-- AND WITH SOME PLEASURE -- LAMBASTED AMERICA ON THE LATEST PERCEIVED SLIGHT, BUT WAS BEREFT OF ANY FRESH THINKING ON HOW BEST TO PROCEED IN STRENGTHENING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP OR ON HOW TO WORK TOGETHER MOST CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ADVANCING PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  BUT, WE HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH.   EASTHAM

PYATT, REASON 1.5 (D)  THIS IS LAHORE 315  1. (C) SUMMARY: MEETING MAY 25 WITH PRINCIPAL OFFICER, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO SAID SHE WOULD NO LONGER PRESS THE GOVERNMENT TO TEST ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME FOR A DETONATION, BENAZIR ARGUED, BUT AT THIS STAGE A TEST WOULD BE COUNTER TO PAKISTAN'S INTERESTS.  INSTEAD, SHE SAID, THE PPP WILL REDIRECT ITS CRITICISM OF NAWAZ SHARIF TO FOCUS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S "INDECISION" AND "MISMANAGEMENT."  BENAZIR ARGUED THAT MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN'S HISTORY WHICH REQUIRES A FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY STRATEGY.  SHE PREDICTED THAT NAWAZ MAY HAVE TO BE "SACRIFICED" IN ORDER TO HEAL THE WOUNDED PRIDE OF PAKISTAN'S MILITARY.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER CAUTIONED THAT BENAZIR'S BELLICOSE REACTION TO INDIA'S TESTS HAD DRAWN HARSH CRITICISM IN THE WEST AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PPP STATE PUBLICLY THAT TESTING IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE USED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED HER WIDELY-REPRINTED OP-ED CALLING FOR A PREEMPTIVE MILITARY STRIKE ON INDIA, CLAIMING THAT SHE INVOKED THIS POSSIBILITY ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE -- NOT AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION.  ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, SHE RECOMMENDED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD FOLLOWED BY NEGOTIATIONS TO RATIFY THE CURRENT DIVISION OF KASHMIR. END SUMMARY.  2. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER MET MAY 25 AT HER REQUEST WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO, WHO WAS IN LAHORE FOR AN APPEARANCE BEFORE THE HIGH COURT'S ACCOUNTABILITY BENCH.  SHE WAS JOINED BY PPP PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT RAO SIKANDER IQBAL AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR QASIM ZIA.  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS IN WHICH PPP LEADERS HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED OUR ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF RESTRAINT (REFTEL) AND TO HAVE CONVINCED BENAZIR TO SOFTEN HER RHETORIC.  SENATE OPPOSITION LEADER AITZAZ AHSAN WENT SO FAR AS TO CLAIM ON MAY 24 THAT BENAZIR HAD "TAKEN A U-TURN" AND OPENLY OPPOSED NUCLEAR TESTING IN RECENT PPP LEADERSHIP MEETINGS.  BACK FROM THE BRINK -------------------  3. (C) ASKED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT SHE HAD URGED NATION-WIDE DEMONSTRATIONS IN FAVOR OF TESTING, BENAZIR CLAIMED THAT NO ONE IN THE PPP WOULD CALL FOR TESTING FROM NOW ON.  THE MOMENT HAS PASSED. WE UNDERSTAND THAT A TEST NOW WOULD HAVE A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON PAKISTAN'S ECONOMY AND INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.  I CANNOT SAY THESE THINGS PUBLICLY, BENAZIR SAID, BUT NEITHER WILL I CALL FOR A DETONATION.  AT THE OPPOSITION'S MAY 21 HYDERABAD RALLY, SHE NOTED, THE LINES THAT GOT THE MOST APPLAUSE WERE NOT TAHIR-UL-QADRI'S CALL FOR NUCLEAR TESTING, BUT HER OWN ATTACKS ON NAWAZ SHARIF'S ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP AND MANHOOD.  WHEN PRESSED ON THE PPP'S POSTURE, BENAZIR CONCEDED THAT EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AGAINST TESTING SHE COULD NOT, SINCE THIS WOULD BE ATTACKED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WE WERE DRIVEN INTO THIS ALLIANCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO DEAL WITH US A LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT -- SO NOW WE MUST LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.  4. (C) MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN'S HISTORY, BENAZIR SAID.  WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE OUR SECURITY AND HOW WE LOOK AT INDIA.  ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES, BENAZIR CONTINUED, THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS IN NO HURRY TO TEST A NUCLEAR DEVICE.  HOWEVER, AT LOWER LEVELS OF THE MILITARY THERE IS A FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE SIMILAR TO SENTIMENTS AFTER THE 1971 LOSS OF BANGLADESH.  "I'M AFRAID NAWAZ MAY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED TO HEAL THAT SENSE OF SHAME," BENAZIR ADDED, "BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHO MIGHT TAKE HIS PLACE."  5. (C) EVEN IF I AM NOT CALLING FOR A NUCLEAR TEST, BENAZIR SUGGESTED, NAWAZ SHARIF WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE TO CRITICISMS OF HIS INDECISION IN THE FACE OF INDIA'S AGGRESSION.  "NAWAZ IS TRYING TO PUT HANDCUFFS ON ME," BENAZIR QUIPPED, "BUT I'M GOING TO PUT BANGLES ON HIM." (NOTE: BY SUGGESTING THAT NAWAZ WEARS BANGLES, AS SHE DID IN HYDERABAD, BENAZIR IS QUESTIONING HIS MASCULINITY -- A DEEP INSULT IN THIS SOCIETY.)  SHIFTING THE DEBATE -------------------  6. (C) IF THE PPP HAS DECIDED NUCLEAR TESTING WOULD BE AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS, PRINCIPAL OFFICER SUGGESTED, THEN IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAKE THIS POINT PUBLICLY.  SO FAR IN THIS DEBATE, THE OPPOSITION HAS APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED MORE BY POLITICS THAN BY NATIONAL INTERESTS.  AT THE VERY LEAST, THE PPP SHOULD SIGNAL TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE PARTY HAS DECIDED THIS ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE TREATED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. BENAZIR WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND INSTRUCTED HER COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW-UP.  7. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER ALSO QUESTIONED BENAZIR ON HER MAY 17 LOS ANGELES TIMES OP-ED, WHICH CONCLUDED BY DANGLING THE POSSIBILITY OF A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON INDIA IN RESPONSE TO THE TESTS.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED THIS INTERPRETATION, CLAIMING THE PIECE WAS DRAFTED TO ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE RESPONSES, NOT AS A PRESCRIPTION FOR ACTION. ACTUALLY, BENAZIR SAID, THE IDEA CAME FROM ROBERT MCNAMARA, WHO SUGGESTED WHEN I WAS IN LONDON THAT A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE WOULD BE ONE OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THE UNITED STATES WAS FACED WITH A SIMILAR THREAT.  8. (C) ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, BENAZIR SUGGESTED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS, AFTER WHICH NEGOTIATIONS COULD BEGIN TO MAKE THE LINE OF CONTROL A PERMANENT BORDER.  GIVEN THE NEW STRATEGIC REALITIES, DIVIDING KASHMIR WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY OPTION.  SHE ASSUMED THAT WESTERN SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR RESTRAINT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE FOLLOWED BY PRESSURE TO COME CLEAN AND ADHERE TO THE CTBT AND NPT.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER REPLIED THAT DECISIONS ON NATIONAL SECURITY WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PAKISTANIS, NOT BY OUTSIDE POWERS.  WE HOPE THE DEBATE OVER PAKISTAN'S SECURITY WILL INCLUDE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE SWATH OF POLITICAL OPINION, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON A MORE CIVILIZED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PML AND PPP.  9 COMMENT: BENAZIR REMAINS FIRMLY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF DRIVING NAWAZ SHARIF FROM OFFICE, AND IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HER TO PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT AWAY AT HIS PUBLIC BASE.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE MOST IN THE OPPOSITION, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LASTING DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE DONE BY A NUCLEAR TEST, AND APPEARS GENUINE IN HER VIEW THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT NOW TEST.  CRITICISM FROM HER MORE COURAGEOUS PARTY COLLEAGUES AND ADVISERS IN THE U.S. MAY ALSO HAVE HELPED TO MODERATE HER OPINION.  THIS SHIFT MAY BUY THE GOVERNMENT A LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM, BUT NOT MUCH.  INDEED, BENAZIR'S NEW TACTIC OF QUESTIONING NAWAZ' MANHOOD MAY PROVE A POWERFUL CATALYST TOWARDS THE NUCLEAR TEST THAT SHE NOW CLAIMS TO OPPOSE.   SIMONS

REASON:  1.5(D).  1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER'S OPPONENTS SEE NAWAZ SHARIF'S HESITATION IN RESPONDING TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR CHALLENGE AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDAS. PAKISTAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP) LEADER BENAZIR BHUTTO HAS CALLED FOR NAWAZ'S RESIGNATION AND THE FORMATION OF A "NATIONAL GOVERNMENT." THE OPPOSITION COALITION PAKISTANI AWAMI ITTEHAD (PAI) -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST ELEMENT -- HAS DEMANDED THAT PAKISTAN CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES (NOT PART OF THE PAI) ARE THREATENING TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO CARRY OUT A NUCLEAR TEST BY MAY 30.  IN PRIVATE, HOWEVER, BENAZIR HERSELF (REF C) AS WELL AS THE PPP'S SPOKESMAN AND ONE OF THE PARTY'S SENATORS SEPARATELY TOLD US THEY FEEL THE TIME IS PAST FOR A NUCLEAR TEST IN RESPONSE TO INDIA'S MAY 11 AND 13 BLASTS. DESPITE OPPOSITION ATTEMPTS TO DEPICT HIM AS WEAK AND INDECISIVE, A RECENT GALLUP POLL GIVES NAWAZ A 77 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING ON HIS HANDLING OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS.  END SUMMARY.  PPP SPOKESMAN SEES INDIAN TEST AS "GODSEND" -------------------------------------------  2.  (C)  PAKISTAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP) SPOKESMAN FARHATULLAH BABAR TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS ON MAY 11 AND MAY 13 WERE A "GODSEND" FOR HIS PARTY'S EFFORTS TO SHAKE NAWAZ SHARIF'S HOLD ON POWER.  BABAR SAID THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS IN KIND HAS NOW BEEN LOST AND IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT PAKISTAN REASSERT ITS DETERMINATION TO RETAIN ITS NUCLEAR OPTION (WITHOUT CONDUCTING A TEST) AND THAT THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT STEP DOWN AND MAKE WAY FOR A "NATIONAL GOVERNMENT" THAT COULD EFFECTIVELY CONFRONT THE INDIAN MENACE.  FOLLOWING A SIMILAR LINE, PPP SENATOR RAZA RABBANI TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT THE TIME FOR PAKISTAN TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S TEST WITH A TEST OF ITS OWN WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN 48 TO 72 HOURS AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS.  NOW, HE SAID, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS WEAKNESS AND INDECISION AND SHOULD STEP ASIDE IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  3.  (U)  THE PPP, THE PAI, AND BHUTTO HERSELF HAVE BEEN SENDING MIXED SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR TEST.  ON MAY 25 BHUTTO TOLD LAHORE PO THAT SHE HAS DROPPED HER CALL FOR PAKISTAN TO CONDUCT ITS OWN NUCLEAR TEST (REF C).  BUT ON MAY 27, THE PRESS QUOTES HER AS SAYING THAT "A NUCLEAR TEST BY PAKISTAN IS NECESSARY TO KEEP INDIA AT BAY AND TO REVITALIZE THE STRUGGLE IN KASHMIR." FOLLOWING HER MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER GOHAR AYUB ON MAY 22, BENAZIR SAID SHE WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH INDIA, BUT THEN REPEATED HER CALL FOR THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  IN LAHORE ON MAY 24, THE PAKISTAN AWAMI ITTEHAD -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT -- CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO INDIA'S NUCLEAR CHALLENGE BY TESTING A PAKISTANI BOMB, OR TO RESIGN.  THE PAI MEETING IN LAHORE WAS ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM 41 POLITICAL PARTIES IN PAKISTAN (MOST OF WHICH HAVE NO ELECTORAL WEIGHT); MINISTER FOR TOURISM SHEIKH RASHID AHMAD ATTENDED TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE.  AFTER DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS WEAK RESPONSE TO THE INDIAN CHALLENGE, BENAZIR BHUTTO ACCUSED NAWAZ ET AL OF SPENDING THEIR TIME LOOKING FOR WAYS TO VICTIMIZE HER AND HER FAMILY RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE COUNTRY'S GRAVE SECURITY SITUATION.  MAY 28 PRESS ACCOUNTS REPORT THAT PAI PRESIDENT PROFESSOR TAHIRUL QADRI HAS SUPPORTED THE MAY 30 DEADLINE FOR A NUCLEAR TEST SET BY THE ISLAMIST PARTIES (SEE BELOW).  ISLAMIC PARTIES DEMAND NUCLEAR TEST -----------------------------------  4.  (U)  ALL OF THE MAJOR ISLAMIC PARTIES, INCLUDING THE JAMAAT-I- ISLAMI (JI) LED BY QAZI HUSSAIN AHMAD, THE JAMIAT-UL-ULEMAI ISLAM (F)(JUI-F), LED BY MAULANA FAZAL-UR-REHMAN, AND THE FACTION OF THE JAMIAT ULEMA E-PAKISTAN (JUP-N) LED BY MAULANA SHAH AHMED NOORANI HAVE PUBLICLY CALLED FOR A PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST.  REFLECTING PERHAPS THE LACK OF PUBLIC DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, THE JI'S CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE ON MAY 22 TO PROTEST THE FAILURE TO CONDUCT A TEST WAS LARGELY IGNORED BY SHOPKEEPERS. VARIOUS OTHER PARTIES HAVE CALLED FOR A NATIONWIDE PROTEST CAMPAIGN IF A TEST DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MAY 30.  IRONICALLY, IN AFGHANISTAN THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM THE JI AND THE JUI-F, HAS ENDORSED PAKISTAN'S RIGHT TO CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST, WHILE CALLING UPON IT TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. MEANWHILE, THE LEADER OF THE PML/N'S COALITION PARTNER, THE SHIIA TEHRIK-E-JAFRIA PAKISTAN (TJP), ALLAMA SAJJID ALI NAQVI, HAS URGED NAWAZ TO REJECT AMERICAN HELP AND TO GO AHEAD WITH A NUCLEAR TEST. IN A REPORT APPEARING IN THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF "THE MUSLIM," NAQVI IS SAID TO BELIEVE THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT MOVE TOWARD THE U.S. AS THIS COULD ENDANGER ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS "TRADITIONAL ALLIES IRAN AND CHINA."  DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS, NOT POLICY ------------------------------------  5.  (C)  BHUTTO'S CRITICISMS OF THE SHARIF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MORE AT ITS TACTICS IN DEALING WITH THE INDIAN THREAT THAN AT ITS POLICY.  HER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE ECHOED BY BABAR IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF MAY 26.  THE PPP'S LINE APPEARS TO BE THAT IF BENAZIR HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER, THE INDIANS WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKELY TO TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  (BABAR, FOR INSTANCE, CREDITED BENAZIR'S PREEMPTIVE DIPLOMACY IN 1995 WITH HEADING OFF AN INDIAN TEST AT THAT TIME.)  SPEAKING AT THE MAY 24 PAI MEETING IN LAHORE, BENAZIR SAID NAWAZ SHARIF'S "GOOD MAN GUJRAL" LINE LAST YEAR HAD BROUGHT PAKISTAN TO "THE BRINK OF DISASTER."  ONCE INDIA DETONATED ITS BOMBS, BENAZIR (AND BABAR) SAID SHARIF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN VIGOROUS ACTION TO LINE-UP INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AND CONDEMNATION OF INDIA. BABAR TOLD POLOFF THAT SHARIF HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS TO SEEK SUPPORT RATHER THAN SENDING A "LOW-LEVEL" CAREER DIPLOMAT LIKE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED.  SHARIF HAD ALSO FAILED TO RALLY THE MUSLIM WORLD TO PAKISTAN'S SIDE, BABAR SAID, AND HE CLAIMED THAT BENAZIR WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN NAWAZ IN WINNING WESTERN SUPPORT.  MEANWHILE, BENAZIR IS CLAIMING CREDIT FOR PAKISTAN'S CAPABILITY OF READYING FOR A TEST IN TWO WEEKS; SHE SAID EARLIER PAKISTAN HAD REQUIRED 30 DAYS TO READY FOR A TEST, BUT SHE HAD CUT THAT BACK.  6.  (C)  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER BABAR NOR BENAZIR HERSELF HAS WARNED NAWAZ AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE RESTRAINT ON NUCLEAR TESTING BY PROMISES OF AID.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES AND MOST OF THE MAJOR URDU AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS HAVE CAUTIONED NAWAZ TO BEWARE OF AMERICAN BLANDISHMENTS.  BENAZIR AND THE PPP, HOWEVER, SEEM WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE U.S. WILL DO IN RETURN FOR PAKISTANI RESTRAINT.  7.  (C)  COMMENT:  POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM -- NOT CONCERNS FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR PAKISTAN -- SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE OPPOSITION'S UNRELENTING ATTACKS ON THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN IN OVERDRIVE DEPICTING NAWAZ AS INDECISIVE AND WEAK, GIVING HIM NO CREDIT FOR TAKING TIME TO WEIGH CAREFULLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF PAKISTAN'S CONDUCTING (OR NOT CONDUCTING) A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE OPPOSITION'S SUCCESS IN TURNING THE PUBLIC AGAINST CONTINUED RESTRAINT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION.  A JUST-RELEASED GALLUP POLL, FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTS THAT OVER TWO-THIRDS OF RESPONDENTS FAVORED A PAK NUCLEAR TEST, BUT "IN RESPONSE TO FRIENDLY ADVICE" TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT, NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD THEN FAVOR CONTINUED RESTRAINT.  77 PERCENT WERE "SATISFIED" WITH HOW NAWAZ SHARIF HAS HANDLED THE SITUATION.  (SEPTEL PROVIDES MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE POLL.)   SIMONS

REASON:  1.5 (B).  1. (U) SOMBER AND TIRED LOOKING, PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF TOLD HIS NATION MAY 28 EVENING THAT PAKISTAN HAD SUCCESSFULLY EXPLODED FIVE NUCLEAR DEVICES SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER IN THE DAY.  A RECURRING THEME THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH WAS THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR THREAT BEGINNING AS FAR BACK AS THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST IN 1974 AND AS RECENTLY AS THE TESTS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS MONTH.  NAWAZ SAID IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TAKEN THE INDIAN THREAT SERIOUSLY, THEN PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT HAVE NEEDED TO TEST.  2. (U) NAWAZ TRIED TO STEEL HIS NATION FOR TOUGH TIMES AHEAD AND DECLARED THAT HE AND ALL GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE READY FOR AN ERA OF AUSTERITY AND SIMPLICITY, STARTING WITH NAWAZ'S GIVING UP THE NEWLY-OPENED AND PALATIAL PRIME MINISTER'S SECRETARIAT BUILDING, WHICH HE PROPOSED COULD BE CONVERTED INTO A HOSPITAL, WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY, OR SOME OTHER CHARITY USE.  HE URGED PAKISTANIS TO BRACE THEMSELVES FOR DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD AND TO FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES COURAGEOUSLY AND BOLDLY.  HE DECLARED PAKISTAN'S OPTIONS OF BECOMING SLAVES OR LEADING HONORABLE AND INDEPENDENT LIVES LEFT PAKISTAN NO CHOICE.  3. (U) REFLECTING INDO-PAK TIT-FOR-TAT MENTALITY, NAWAZ SAID PAKISTAN HAD RESPONDED TO INDIA'S MISSILE TESTS WITH ITS OWN TEST OF THE GHAURI MISSILE LAST MONTH, AND PAKISTAN HAS NOW RESPONDED TO INDIA'S FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS WITH FIVE OF ITS OWN.  HE DECLARED THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PAST DAYS IS NOW GONE, AND IF INDIA IS AGGRESSIVE, PAKISTAN WILL FIGHT BACK -- THE ARMED FORCES ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT AND THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS ARE PREPARED TO MEET ANY CHALLENGE.  NAWAZ SAID THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS HE WILL AGAIN SPEAK TO THE NATION TO ANNOUNCE A "NATIONAL AGENDA."  4. (U) IN A DIPLOMATIC SOP, NAWAZ PRAISED THE CHINESE, WHOM HE CALLED GREAT AND RELIABLE FRIENDS AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE JAPANESE, WHOM HE SAID WOULD HAVE AVOIDED HAVING HAD THEIR CITIES SUBJECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACK HAD JAPAN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE SAID HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FIVE CALLS AND SAID THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD PAKISTAN'S DIFFICULTIES.  5. (C) COMMENT:  AT THE END OF THE DAY, NAWAZ FELL VICTIM TO THE HARDLINERS BOTH IN THE OPPOSITION AND WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT WHO WERE RELENTLESS IN WHIPPING UP A MEDIA FRENZY DEMANDING A PAKISTANI RESPONSE IN KIND.  THERE WERE FEW EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC COUNTERVAILING FORCES BUILDING MEDIA AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR RESTRAINT.  NAWAZ'S DECISION TO TEST WAS FUELED BY CONCERNS THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO GIVE HIS FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION THE "NAWAZ-IS-WEAK-ON-INDIA" ISSUE TO COALESCE AROUND IN THEIR BID TO FORCE HIM FROM POWER.  IN HIS SPEECH, NAWAZ PLAYED TO PAKISTANI FEARS OF INDIAN EXPANSIONISM AND DISTRUST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW LONG PAKISTANIS WILL RALLY AROUND THE FLAG ONCE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS KICK IN, FURTHER CHALLENGING THIS ALREADY VULNERABLE ECONOMY.  NAWAZ'S NOTION THAT PAKISTANIS WILL "SACRIFICE" BY GIVING UP LONG CHERISHED "RIGHTS" SUCH AS STEALING NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY AND AVOIDING TAXES STRIKE US AS MORE WISHFUL THAN REALISTIC.  PAKISTANIS HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED TALKING ABOUT EATING GRASS (IN PURSUIT OF NATIONAL SECURITY) RATHER THAN ACTUALLY HAVING TO EAT IT.   SIMONS

THE GROUP WILL MEET WITH IRANIAN RELIGIOUS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WILL COMMEMORATE THE DEATH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENI ON JUNE 3.  THE TRIP SUGGESTS THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO PROMOTE SHIA-SUNNI HARMONY HERE, RATHER THAN DISCORD, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPECTED PREVIOUSLY.  2. (C)  BOKHARI DOWNPLAYED POLITICAL CONFLICT IN IRAN, CHARACTERIZING THE KHAMENI-KHATAMI SPLIT AS "MINOR."  HOWEVER, HE FRANKLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  HE BELIEVES THE PROGRAM IS PROCEEDING QUICKLY, THANKS TO FORMER SOVIET SCIENTISTS "PURCHASED" FROM RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AZERBAIJAN AND UZBEKISTAN.  WHILE HE SAID HE HAD NEVER MET SUCH SCIENTISTS, WHO ARE KEPT HIDDEN AWAY IN RESEARCH FACILITIES, HE SAID LEADING IRANIAN POLITICIANS HAD TOLD HIM THEY WERE PERFORMING WELL.  3. (C)  FOUR TJP ACTIVISTS HAD BEEN KILLED (TWO IN MUZZAFFARGARH DISTRICT AND TWO IN MULTAN) SINCE OUR LAST MEETING WITH BOKHARI ON APRIL 21. HOWEVER, BOKHARI BELIEVES THAT ONLY ABOUT 20 DANGEROUS SUNNI LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI TERRORISTS REMAIN AT LARGE.  BASED ON HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADING LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, HE IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE KILLERS CAN SOON BE CAPTURED OR GUNNED DOWN. BOKHARI DID NOT REPEAT ASSERTIONS (REFTEL) THAT THE USG SUPPORTED OR SUPPORTS THE LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI.  SIMONS

CLINTON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WASHINGTON, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,  I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERILOUS SITUATION RESULTING FROM INDIA'S NUCLEAR TESTS.  OUR TELEPHONIC CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST FORTNIGHT CONVINCED ME OF YOUR SINCERITY AND YOUR GENUINE CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN'S SECURITY AND THE STABILITY OF THE REGION.  THE OVERT NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION OF INDIA HAS CREATED A STRATEGIC IMBALANCE, EMBOLDENING INDIAN LEADERSHIP TO HOLD OUT THREATS OF NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL AGAINST PAKISTAN AND AGGRESSION ACROSS THE LINE OF CONTROL IN KASHMIR.  AS ADVISED BY YOU AND OUR OTHER FRIENDS, WE PONDERED HARD AND DELIBERATED CAREFULLY ON OUR DIRE SECURITY PREDICAMENT.  DETERMINED TO ACT WITH UTMOST RESPONSIBILITY, DESPITE GRAVE PROVOCATIONS, WE ALSO CLOSELY EVALUATED THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION, WHICH REGRETTABLY DID NOT FACTOR THE THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND TO REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY.  WHILE I WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SECURITY CONCERNS, THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO INDIA'S CROSSING OF THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD WAS REGRETTABLY DEFERENTIAL, BORDERING ON ACQUIESCENCE.  WE SAW A FAMILIAR PATTERN, WHEREBY INDIA'S INCREMENTAL STEPS ON THE NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC LADDER HAD ONLY GENERATED PRESSURES AND EVEN PUNITIVE ACTIONS AGAINST PAKISTAN.  FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, PAKISTAN ADVOCATED, IN ALL EARNEST, THE GOAL OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION.  OUR IMPECCABLE RECORD OF RESTRAINT AND RESPONSIBILITY NEVER EARNED US ANY APPROBATION. SELECTIVE SANCTIONS ONLY SERVED TO DEGRADE OUR CONVENTIONAL CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCED A TOTALLY UNTENABLE SECURITY EQUATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  THE EVIDENT SELECTIVITY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE GLOBAL NON- PROLIFERATION GOALS, WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY PROBLEMS THAT IMPEL PROLIFERATION, HAD INCENSED OUR PEOPLE.  AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AT WHICH OUR VERY LIFE AND EXISTENCE ARE AT STAKE, THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN WERE UNANIMOUS IN DEMANDING THAT WE SEEK TO RECTIFY THE STRATEGIC IMBALANCE RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION BY INDIA.  HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS AND LEFT WITH NO CHOICE, WE HAVE IN OUR SUPREME NATIONAL INTEREST DECIDED TO EXERCISE THE NUCLEAR OPTION.  THIS DECISION, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN WITH A HEAVY HEART, WAS NECESSITATED BY THE IMPERATIVES OF SELF-DEFENCE AND TO DETER AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE NEED FOR URGENT STEPS TO BRING ABOUT NUCLEAR STABILIZATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  I HAVE, THEREFORE, OFFERED TO DISCUSS WITH INDIA, ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE REGION AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  WE TRUST THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MAJOR POWERS WILL ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE NOT ONLY THE RESUMPTION OF THE PAKISTAN- INDIA TALKS BUT EARLY CONCLUSION OF MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RESTRAINTS, ACCOMPANIED BY CONFIDENCE ENHANCING MEASURES.  WE WOULD ALSO URGE YOU TO FULLY ENDORSE AND SUPPORT OUR PROPOSAL FOR A NON-AGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA, ON THE BASIS OF AN EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR DISPUTE.  I AM ALSO REQUESTING THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER G-8 COUNTRIES TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER COLLECTIVELY INITIATING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO URGENTLY ADDRESS STABILIZATION MEASURES SO AS TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND TO REDUCE THE DANGERS OF A NUCLEAR CONFLICT IN SOUTH ASIA. 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 006509  DEPT FOR SA/PAB, DS, AND S/CT; CENTCOM/CINCPAC ALSO FOR POLAD; LONDON FOR POL/SUTPHIN; PARIS FOR RAVELING  E.O. 12958:  DECL:  8/29/03 TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PK SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  A CONVERSATION WITH BENAZIR BHUTTO  (U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. REASON 1.5(D).  1.   (C)  SUMMARY:  WITH HER RIVAL NAWAZ SHARIF IN DEEP POLITICAL TROUBLE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO IS SEEKING TO RESHAPE HER IMAGE AND REVIVE HER OWN TATTERED POLITICAL FORTUNES. IN A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON AUGUST 27, SHE CONDEMNED THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, ADVOCATED DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, CALLED FOR THE END OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN AN ALL-PARTY CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT WHEN AND IF THE NAWAZ REGIME FALLS .  WILLING ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER OWN MISTAKES, SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PORTRAY HERSELF TO A U.S. AUDIENCE AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, PRO-WESTERN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL FORCES AT LARGE IN THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY  2.   QNGERS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  ALTHOUGH NO FRIEND OF NAWAZ SHARIF, BENAZIR EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, DESPITE ITS OVERWHELMING PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, WAS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS PARTIES, PREEMINENTLY THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND THE JAMAAT-ULEMA-I-ISLAMI.  SHE FEARED THAT, IF THE SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY BEGAN TO BRING PEOPLE OUT INTO THE STREETS, THESE ELEMENTS WOULD MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH SYMPATHETIC RETIRED GENERALS FROM THE ZIA ERA TO SPEARHEAD A FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC TAKEOVER.  SHE NOTED THAT THE NEWSPAPERS WERE FULL OF ARTICLES BY INFLUENTIAL FORMER GENERALS MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  (COMMENT:  WE DOUBT SHE REALLY BELIEVES THAT HEADLINE-GRABBERS SUCH AS FORMER COAS MIRZA ALSAM BEG AND FORMER DG/ISI HAMEED GUL ARE A THREAT.)  3.   (C)  ON THE ARMY.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE ALSO PLENTY OF ACTIVE DUTY MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICERS SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST CAUSE.  THE TOP ARMY LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER, REMAINED SOLID AND MODERATE.  INDEED, SHE CONCEDED THAT ARMY INTERVENTION OF SOME SORT COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO AVERT A FUNDAMENTALIST TAKEOVER IF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO CRUMBLE. SHE THOUGHT THE ARMY COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE BY SETTING UP A TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING HER OWN PPP AND NAWAZ'S PML (WITHOUT NAWAZ, OF COURSE).  BUT SHE WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL THAT THE ARMY COULD RULE EFFECTIVELY ON ITS OWN BASED ON ITS PAST PERFORMANCE.  4.   (C) ON NAWAZ.  BENAZIR MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE HER DISLIKE OF NAWAZ SHARIF, WHOM SHE REGARDED AS BOTH WEAK AND NOT VERY BRIGHT. SHE APPEARED TO HARBOR AN EVEN GREATER DISLIKE FOR HIS BROTHER SHAHBAZ, WHO SHE CHARACTERIZED AS MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT ALSO MORE BRUTAL, RELATING A BRIEF ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW HE HAD ORDERED A HAPLESS BUREAUCRAT THROWN INTO A SEWER IN A MOMENT OF PERSONAL PIQUE.  INTERESTINGLY, SHE WAS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE NAWAZ'S GROWING FLIRTATION WITH ISLAMIZATION TO HIS OWN LIGHTS RATHER THAN SIMPLY TO POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM.  SHE CONTENDED THAT NAWAZ'S FATHER HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE TO "TALIBANISH" (HER WORD) ULEMA (RELIGIOUS LEADERS) IN LAHORE AND HAD INCULCATED THESE SORTS OF VALUES IN THE YOUNG NAWAZ.  SHE SAID THAT NAWAZ HAD DONE THE SAME TO HIS OWN SON, NOTING THAT THE YOUNGER SHARIF HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS AGE WHEN INTERVIEWED RECENTLY ON TELEVISION IN KEEPING WITH A CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SUPERSTITION.  5.   (C) ON HER OWN MISTAKES.  ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO DIFFQHAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, BENAZIR SAID SQ WOULD ENDED THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM THAT LAID THE BASIS FOR THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF HER AS CORRUPT.  SHE LAMENTED THAT THERE HAD DEVELOPED IN PAKISTAN A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH INCOMING GOVERNMENT PACKED THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH ITS OWN CRONIES.  THIS WAS A RECIPE FOR BOTH INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION. SHE HAD BEEN AS GUILTY OF THE PRACTICE AS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT LEADER BUT NO MORE SO.  SHE NOTED THAT SHE HAD YET TO BE CONVICTED ON ANY CORRUPTION CHARGE DESPITE TWO YEARS OF GOVERNMENT DIGGING.  NONETHELESS, THE PRACTICE OF PATRONAGE WAS DESTRUCTIVE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE.  THIS WOULD BE A KEY ELEMENT OF HER POLICY WERE SHE EVER TO RETURNQT: DURING THIS EXCHANGE, SHE DID NOT MENTION HER HUSBAND, WHO WAS HER CHIEF BAG MAN AND PATRONAGE DISPENSER.)  6.   (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. HER CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES WAS STANDARD FARE. SHE SAID THE EFFORT TO FORCE THE INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS (IPPS) TO RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS SIGNED BY HER REGIME HAD HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR GOVERNMENTS TO HONOR THE AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR PREDECESSORS EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE THE TERMS.  OTHERWISE, THE PREDICTABILITY AND CONFIDENCE SO ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT WOULD BE LACKING.  BENAZIR WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FREEZE HARD CURRENCY ACCOUNTS IN THE WAKE OF ITS NUCLEAR TESTS.  SHE BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO CLUE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION SAVE FOR BEGGING FROM RICH ARAB NEIGHBORS AND THROWING ITSELF ON THE MERCY OF THE IMF.  7.   (C) ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HER OWN PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION TO PROFESSIONALIZING THE CIVIL SERVICE, BENAZIR SAID SHE STRONGLY FAVORED DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS.  GOVERNMENT-OWNED ENTERPRISES SHOULD BE SOLD OFF AND THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND BUREAUCRATS SHARPLY REDUCED.  THE MILITARY BUDGET WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE REDUCED.  PAKISTAN COULD NOT PRETEND TO MATCH INDIA SOLDIER FOR SOLDIER AND MACHINE FOR MACHINE AND WOULD NEED TO TAILOR ITS FOREIGN POLICY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS REALITY. AS FOR THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, SHE SAID SHE FAVORED SHUTTING DOWN THE MADARASSA SCHOOLS THAT WERE CHURNING OUT SO MANY YOUNG FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HER BASIC THEME, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT FUNDAMENTALISM WAS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY BY ENDING CORRUPTION, DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AND ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  8.   (C) ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  BENAZIR TOLD POLCOUNS SHE HAD SEEN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD AGREED TO SIGN THE CTBT DURING THE SHAMSHAD-TALBOTT TALKS IN LONDON ON AUGUST 25.  SHE HOPED THIS WAS TRUE, SINCE PAKISTAN COULD NOT AFFORD A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE WITH INDIA OR BAD RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  SHE SAID THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT FLOWING FROM THE MAY NUCLEAR TESTS WAS ITS IMPACT ON THE U.S. THE TESTS HAD FORCED THE UNITED STATES TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN NEEDED ACTIVE U.S. ENGAGEMENT AND SHE HOPED THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE REGION.  9.   (C) ON THE TALIBAN AND BIN LADEN.  BENAZIR SAID SHE HAD STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS AND WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM OF ANY KIND.  BUT SHE FELT THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE PURSUED USAMA BIN LADEN THROUGH THE UN PROCESS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE AUGUST 20 CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES HAD ALIENATED PUBLIC OPINION THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  SHE SAID SHE WAS NO FAN OF THE TALIBAN, WHOM SHE VIEWED AS AN EXTENSION OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  INDEED, SHE WAS FEARFUL THAT RETURNING TALIBAN MIGHT SERVE AS FOOT SOLDIERS FOR RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS IN A FUTURE CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES.  10.  (C) ON WHAT IS GOING RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  DESPITE HER OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND FEAR OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, BENAZIR SAID SHE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN MANY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN PAKISTAN IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE DEATH OF ZIA (AUGUST 17, 1988) AND RETURN OF DEMOCRACY.  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD FELT ITS STING MORE THAN ANY OTHER PAKISTANI POLITICIAN, SHE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PAKISTAN HAD DEVELOPED A REMARKABLY FREE PRESS, WHICH SHE BELIEVED WAS AN ESSENTIAL UNDERPINNING OF GENUINE DEMOCRACY.  SHE SAID SHE ALSO BELIEVED THAT THE JUDICIARY HAD ACHIEVED A LARGE MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM POLITICAL AUTHORITIES.  SHE ALSO THOUGHT THAT ORDINARY PAKISTANIS HAD BEGUN TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND TO QUESTION WHAT THEY WERE TOLD BY THE GOVERNMENT AND BY POLITICIANS RATHER THAN PASSIVELY ACCEPT SIMPLISTIC SLOGANS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE.  11.  (C) ON HER CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THE WEAKNESS OF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT HAD IMPROVED HER OWN POLITICAL POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRONG IN RURAL AREAS, BUT REMAINED WEAK IN URBAN PUNJAB.  SHE RUED THE FACT THAT THE ELECTORAL WEAKNESS OF HER OWN PPP PARTY (REDUCED IN THE LAST ELECTION TO ITS SINDHI BASE) HAD FORCED HER TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER, MORE EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS PARTIES UNDER THE  PAKISTAN AWAMI ITIHAT (PAI) UMBRELLA.  BUT SHE FELT THAT HER PARTY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF OPPOSITION ON ITS OWN.  MORE RECENTLY, SHE HAD ALSO BEGAN REACHING OUT TO SOME OF THE NATIONALIST REGIONAL PARTIES, SUCH AS THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE-BASED ANP.  HOWEVER, WHEN ASKED HOW SHE COULD MANEUVER FROM WHERE SHE WAS NOW BACK INTO A POSITION OF POWER HER ONLY COMMENT WAS A RUEFUL "THAT IS THE 64 DOLLAR QUESTION."  12.  (C) COMMENT.  BENAZIR WAS RELAXED AND TALKATIVE DURING A CONVERSATION THAT STRETCHED ON FOR NINETY MINUTES.  HER COMMENTS WERE CLEARLY CALCULATED TO GO DOWN WELL WITH AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE AND SHE CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING HERSELF AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, MORE WESTERN-ORIENTED ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND ITS EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALIST FOES.  SHE HAS RECENTLY TURNED FOR ADVICE TO A MODERATE FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, RETIRED GENERAL TALAT MASOOD, WHO IS NOTED FOR PROMOTING THE NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN PAKISTAN.  AS FOR WHETHER BENAZIR BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING, THAT IS HARD TO SAY.  HER BEST CHANCE OF ONE DAY RETURNING TO POWER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY AS PART OF A COALITION RATHER THAN ON HER OWN.  THAT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD THING, GIVEN THAT, LEFT STRICTLY TO HER OWN DEVICES, SHE WOULD REMAIN BEHOLDEN TO THE LANDLORDS OF HER FEUDAL SINDH BASE, AND THESE ARE NOT THE SORT OF PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENDING PATRONAGE AND PROMOTING INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REFORMS.  END COMMENT.   MILAM 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 007870  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/08 TAGS: PGOV, PTER, MNUC, ENRG, PK SUBJECT: SHAHBAZ SHARIF ON NUCLEAR ISSUES, ISLAMIZATION AND POWER  REF: LAHORE 500  CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY PYATT, REASON 1.5 (D)  THIS IS LAHORE 572  1. (C) SUMMARY.  MEETING OCTOBER 14 WITH VISITING AMBASSADOR MILAM, PUNJAB CHIEF MINISTER SHAHBAZ SHARIF EMPHASIZED HIS BROTHER'S COMMITMENT TO FINDING COMMON GROUND WITH THE UNITED STATES ON PROLIFERATION ISSUES, JUSTIFIED THE RECENT REDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS AS A POLITICAL IMPERATIVE, AND DEFENDED THE GOVERNMENT'S ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT AS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT WOULD NOT ALTER PAKISTAN'S HISTORICALLY MODERATE COURSE.  SHAHBAZ RECALLED HIS MID-AUGUST MEETINGS WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, AND CLAIMED THAT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE ROADMAP WHICH HE HAD DISCUSSED.  HE PROMISED IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON EXPORT CONTROLS BUT INDICATED THAT FURTHER MOVEMENT TOWARDS A FISSILE MATERIAL CUT-OFF WOULD REQUIRE STEPS TO REDRESS THE INHERENT IMBALANCE OF THE INDO-PAK SECURITY RELATIONSHIP.  IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE OSAMA BIN LADEN ISSUE IN AFGHANISTAN, URGED SHAHBAZ TO SPEAK TO THE PM ABOUT INCREASING GOP EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL AND ABOUT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY'S RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW THE AMBASSADOR TO ENGAGE THE PM ON AFGHANISTAN.  SHAHBAZ AGREED TO TALK TO THE PM.  END SUMMARY.   THE WAY FORWARD ON NON-PROLIFERATION ------------------------------------  2. (C) AFTER A FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTETAKER WAS ESCORTED OUT OF THE MEETING, SHAHBAZ SPOKE CANDIDLY AND AT LENGTH ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES AND ITS HOPES FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY, THE CHIEF MINISTER LAMENTED, BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO GET BACK ON COURSE TO FOCUS ON PAKISTAN'S URGENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS.  3. (C) RECALLING HIS LATE SUMMER MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED THAT GOP ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE "ROAD MAP" THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT. WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE FOR US TO DO, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  SOME STEPS, SUCH AS ENHANCING EXPORT CONTROLS, WE WOULD TAKE EVEN WITHOUT YOUR PRESSURE.  THIS IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  OTHER STEPS, INCLUDING THE FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF, REQUIRE THAT WE FIRST DETERMINE HOW TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM DETERRENCE VIS-A-VIS INDIA.  WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT INDIA IS THE AGGRESSOR WHICH STARTED THE CYCLE OF NUCLEAR TESTING.  IT FRUSTRATES US, SHAHBAZ ADDED, THAT FRIENDS LIKE THE UNITED STATES SOMETIMES APPEAR TO OVERLOOK THIS BASIC FACT.  WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING IN GENEVA, BUT UNCONDITIONAL PAKISTANI ADHERENCE TO THE FMCT IS A PROBLEM.  WE MUST FIND A WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCKPILES AND BRING SOME FORM OF PARITY TO OUR SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA, SHAHBAZ CONCLUDED.  4. (C) THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE THREE PARTNERS IN THESE DELIBERATIONS, AMBASSADOR MILAM RESPONDED.  BUT WE THINK FMCT IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD.  BOTH PAKISTAN AND INDIA NEED TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THEIR NUCLEAR POLICIES.  SHAHBAZ AGAIN CAME BACK TO THE POLITICS OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION DEBATE. NAWAZ SHARIF MUST BE SEEN TO BE DEFENDING PAKISTAN'S SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS.  FOR THAT REASON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED, WHATEVER STEPS ARE REQUIRED AND WHATEVER INDUCEMENTS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PROVIDES MUST BE VIEWED AS EQUITABLE AND FAIR.   SOUTH ASIA'S KOSOVO -------------------  5. (C) SHAHBAZ TURNED TO THE BROADER ISSUE OF INDO-PAK RELATIONS, NOTING THAT "WE'D BE LIVING IN A FOOLS PARADISE" TO SEEK PROGRESS ON NON-PROLIFERATION WHILE IGNORING THE CONFRONTATION OVER KASHMIR.  THIS WAS NOT WHAT INDIA AND PAKISTAN WERE MEANT TO BE, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED, FIGHTING PROXY WARS AND SQUANDERING EACH OTHER'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  LOOK AT TRADE.  THINK HOW MUCH WE COULD SAVE IF PAKISTAN WERE ABLE TO BUY COAL FROM INDIAN MINES INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT FROM THE AMERICAS.  BUT THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE CAN MOVE THE RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL, BUT WE NEED YOU TO THROW YOUR WEIGHT BEHIND A SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.  AS YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO, THE UNITED STATES MUST BRING IT'S AUTHORITY TO BEAR ON THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.   THE POWER IMBROGLIO -------------------  6. (C) AMBASSADOR MILAM RAISED THE ISSUE OF INDEPENDENT POWER PROVIDERS (IPP'S), NOTING OUR PUZZLEMENT ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN CONSUMER ELECTRICITY RATES COMING IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF.  WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE ELECTRICITY TARIFFS, SHAHBAZ INSISTED.   FROM KHYBER TO KARACHI, PAKISTANIS WERE CLAMORING FOR RELIEF FROM UTILITY BILLS THAT WERE CONSUMING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOMES.  PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.  THIS GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF REVERSING THE MARKET-ORIENTED DIRECTION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SET IN HIS FIRST MONTHS; THAT'S NOT EVEN AN PEOPLE A SENSE OF HOPE.   THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT -----------------------  7. (U) AS THE CONVERSATION DREW TO A CLOSE, THE CHIEF MINISTER RAISED THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON ISLAMIZATION.  YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT UP, SO I WILL, SHAHBAZ NOTED.  THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT'S WESTERN, LIBERAL ORIENTATION.  THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN WEARING ALL MY OLD WESTERN BUSINESS SUITS, HE JOKED, INSTEAD OF THE SHALWAR THAT MOST PAKISTANI POLITICIANS TREAT AS THEIR UNIFORM.  SHAHBAZ ALSO DREW ATTENTION HIS OCTOBER 14 SPEECH AT A WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION MEETING IN LAHORE WHERE HE HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE THAT FEMALE MANAGERS, ADMINISTRATORS AND SCIENTISTS MUST PLAY IN PAKISTAN'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  CAN WE THINK OF DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING WOMEN WHO WEAR A VEIL OR SIT AT HOME, SHAHBAZ ASKED IN HIS SPEECH. IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE.  8. (U) THERE SHOULD BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR REASONS FOR ADVANCING THE 15TH AMENDMENT, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  AFTER WESTERN PRESSURE ON CTBT AND THE AIR STRIKES ON AFGHANISTAN, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES WERE RIDING HIGH.  BUT THIS ONE ACTION OF INTRODUCING THE ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT HAS TAKEN THE WIND OUT OF THEIR SAILS.  9.  (C) IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED HIS INCREASING PREOCCUPATION WITH AFGHANISTAN, AND ESPECIALLY THE ISSUE OF THE TALEBAN HARBORING OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE TO THE U.S., AND OUR SENSE IS THAT, PERHAPS, WITH ADDED PUSH THE U.S., PAKISTAN AND SAUDI ARABIA CAN PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL.  WE NEED A STRONGER PUSH ON THIS BY THE GOP.  THE AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO SEE THE PM ON THIS BUT WAS BEING SCREENED OFF BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SHAHBAZ TO TALK TO THE PM ABOUT THIS.  THE CHIEF MINISTER SAID HE WOULD.  COMMENT -------  10. (C) IN BOTH THIS MEETING AND A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH WITH HIS SENIOR ADVISORS, SHAHBAZ DISPLAYED THE MIXTURE OF IMPATIENCE AND REFORMIST ZEAL THAT HAVE BECOME HIS HALLMARK.  COMPARED EVEN TO THE LAST MEETING WITH HIM IN LATE AUGUST (REFTEL), WE FOUND HIM MORE CONVERSANT AND MORE WILLING TO VENTURE AN OPINION ON THE SECURITY ISSUES THAT FORM THE CORE OF THE U.S.-PAKISTAN BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  IMPLICIT IN THE SCOPE OF OUR TWO HOUR CONVERSATION AND LUNCH WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT PROGRESS ON NON- PROLIFERATION AND THE RELATED SANCTIONS, THE EXPERIMENT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM THAT SHAHBAZ HAS LAUNCHED IN PUNJAB (LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF) MAY COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND. END COMMENT.   MILAM 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 008066  DEPT FOR D, P, SA/PAB; LONDON FOR POL/SUTPHIN; PARIS FOR POL/RAVELING  E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/27/08 TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PK SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: FUNDAMENTALISM AND SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE (C-NA8-01076)  REFS:  (A) STATE 190698, (B) ISLAMABAD 7155  (U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON 1.5(D).  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH A SAMPLING OF RURAL PUNJABI POLITICIANS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT RECRUITMENT TO MILITANT RELIGIOUS GROUPS IS INCREASING IN POORER AREAS OF THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE (PRIMARILY SOUTHERN PUNJAB), BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING.  THESE SAME SOURCES ALSO CONTEND THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN ARE HIGHLY POPULAR AMONG POORLY EDUCATED PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS (AND PROBABLY URBAN AREAS AS WELL).  SUCH POPULARITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED, BUT EXISTS AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, REFLECTING THE NEED FOR SUCCESSFUL ROLE MODELS ON THE PART OF ORDINARY MUSLIMS FED UP WITH THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO MEET BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.  END SUMMARY.  2.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL A, POLCOUNS HAS RECENTLY SPOKEN WITH THREE PML MNAS REPRESENTING RURAL CONSTITUENCIES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  THE THREE ARE MUMTAZ AHMED TARAR, A NAWAZ SHARIF LOYALIST WHO SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SERVICES COMMITTEE, COL (R) GHULAM SARWAR CHEEMA, A PARTY SWITCHING FORMER PPP MINISTER OF STATE WHO NOW SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE COMMITTEE, AND SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, A LIBERAL-MINDED MNA NOW SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, TO WHOM POLCOUNS PAID A REPEAT VISIT.  THE SUBJECT WAS SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE TALIBAN IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  3.  (C) IN THE JUDGMENT OF POLCOUNS, TARAR WAS THE MOST COMPELLING WITNESS.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION, HE CONTENDED THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM (DEFINED AS SUPPORT FOR MILITANT RELIGIOUS GROUPS) IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ONLY IN RURAL DISTRICTS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE LANDHOLDINGS (I.E., QUASI-FEUDAL AREAS), WHERE THERE WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE NOTS.  THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY IN THESE REGIONS HELPED TO FUEL EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES.  HE CITED THE MULTAN, BAHAWALPUR, MIANWALI AND SARGHODA AREAS AS EXAMPLES.  IN OTHER DISTRICTS, WHERE SMALL LANDHOLDERS PREVAIL AND THERE IS A FUNCTIONING MIDDLE CLASS, THERE ARE FEWER SOCIAL TENSIONS AND EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES ARE HELD BY ONLY BY A FEW.  HIS OWN DISTRICT, MANDI BAHAUDIN IN CENTRAL PUNJAB, FELL INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY.  LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BELONGED TO MILITANT GROUPS, USUALLY THE SUNNI SECTARIAN SIPAH-E-SAHABA PAKISTAN (SSP).  4.  (C) TARAR SAID THE CASE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE BELIEVED THAT UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN HIS DISTRICT AND, INDEED, THROUGHOUT URBAN AND RURAL PUNJAB, HAVE A HIGHLY FAVORABLE OPINION OF BOTH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE OPINED THAT BIN LADEN IS THE HERO OF THE MOMENT IN PAKISTAN AND WOULD WIN ANY ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ANY WELLSPRING OF FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE NOT PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS.  IT WAS DUE RATHER TO THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN APPEARED TO ORDINARY FOLK AS ISLAMIC HEROES WHO HAD NOT ONLY STOOD UP TO THE ANTI-ISLAMIC WEST BUT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SO DOING.  THIS WAS A HEADY CONTRAST TO THE PERCEIVED INEFFECTUALITY OF THEIR OWN LEADERS.  5.  (C) TARAR ADDED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE 15TH AMENDMENT WAS SIMILARLY WIDESPREAD IN HIS DISTRICT.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO RELIGIOUS CONVICTION, BUT BECAUSE HIS CONSTITUENTS BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD EMPOWER THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING SWIFT JUSTICE AND LAW AND ORDER TO THE COUNTRY.  DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN IN RURAL AREAS, TARAR SAW LITTLE DANGER THAT PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE COULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE MILITANT ACTION.  THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE AND TOO REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS OF POWER.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS WERE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON OBTAINING GOVERNMENT LOANS WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY AGENTS TO SMUGGLE THEM INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  HE ESTIMATED THAT FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE WORKING OR HAD WORKED ABROAD.  THE REAL DANGER CAME FROM THE URBAN AREAS, WHERE THERE WAS A MUCH LARGER CADRE OF FUNDAMENTALIST RABBLE ROUSERS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY MOBILIZE LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE.  6.  (C) THE URBANE, HIGHLY POLISHED COL CHEEMA REPRESENTS A RURAL PUNJABI CONSTITUENCY NEAR GUJRANWALA AND OWNS PROPERTY IN THREE OTHERS (NEAR LAHORE, FAISALABAD AND JHANG).  HE WAS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIONISTIC AND LESS SPECIFIC IN HIS OWN VIEWS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM IN RURAL PUNJAB.  HIS OWN BELIEF WAS THAT THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE PEOPLE HAD DESTROYED THE FAITH OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS IN THE ABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL CLASS (MILITARY AND CIVILIAN) TO PROVIDE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND SATISFY BASIC ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NEEDS.  THIS, IN TURN, HAD MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALTERNATIVE MESSAGES, SUCH AS THOSE CONVEYED TWO DECADES AGO BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND, MORE RECENTLY, BY THE TALIBAN.  7.  (C) RICH WITH ANECDOTES, HE TOLD THE STORY OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO HAD COME TO HIM FOR HELP DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HIS DISTRICT.  ALTHOUGH THE ONLY ELECTRICAL ITEM IN HER ONE ROOM HOUSE WAS A LIGHT BULB HER BILL AMOUNTED TO 3000 RUPEES (60 DOLLARS, A FORMIDABLE SUM).  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD A FAN, SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO RUN IT.  CHEEMA SAID THAT, WHILE HE HAD MANAGED TO GET HER BILL REDUCED TO 2500 RUPEES, THE WOMAN WAS TYPICAL OF THE CASES HE GETS DURING HIS WEEKLY AUDIENCES WITH CONSTITUENTS.  HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF INCREASING POVERTY, WHICH MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS MESSAGES.  8.  (C) CHEEMA ALSO BEMOANED THE MANY FUNDAMENTALIST MADRASSAS (RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS) THAT HAD SPRUNG UP RECENTLY.  HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE SON OF A CONSTITUENT WHO HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO DROP OUT OF STANFORD BY A VISITING PAKISTANI "TABLIGHI" (LAY ISLAMIC PROSELYTIZER) AND RETURN TO PAKISTAN TO ENROLL IN A MADRASSA NEAR LAHORE.  HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LOST TO HIS FAMILY, WHO STRUGGLED TO GAIN PERMISSION TO SEE HIM AND RECEIVED FOR THEIR TROUBLES A PERFUNCTORY HELLO AND GOOD-BYE.  HIS SENSE WAS THAT RECRUITMENT TO RADICAL MADRASSAS HAD BEEN SHARPLY ON THE INCREASE RECENTLY, SERVING AS A MAGNET FOR DISAFFECTED YOUTH.  MUHAMMAD KHALID MASUD, PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, ECHOED THIS IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON OCTOBER 24 CONTENDING THAT EXTREMIST VIEWS WERE COMING TO DOMINATE THE ENTIRE MADRASSA SYSTEM.  9.  (C) CHEEMA SAID IT WAS HIS SENSE THAT SUCH TRENDS WERE FRAYING AT THE VERY FABRIC OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY, CAUSING THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.  SWITCHING METAPHORS, HE LIKENED PAKISTAN TO A DRIED OUT BALE OF HAY THAT NEEDED ONLY THE SLIGHTEST OF SPARKS TO SET IT ALIGHT.  NOTING THE SHARP INCREASE IN SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND APPEARANCE OF MYRIAD SECTS ALL HOLDING THEIR OWN MONOPOLIES ON THE TRUTH, HE FEARED THAT ONCE THE SPARK WAS LIT ALL THESE GROUPS WOULD BE AT EACH OTHERS THROATS.  LOOKING AT POLCOUNS RUEFULLY, HE COMMENTED THAT WHILE POLCOUNS WOULD SERVE IN PAKISTAN FOR ONLY A YEAR OR TWO, HE AND HIS COUNTRYMEN WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN BEHIND.  10.  (C) IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH TARAR AND CHEEMA, POLCOUNS ALSO PAID A RETURN VISIT TO SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, WHO HAD EARLIER REPORTED A SHARP INCREASE IN FUNDAMENTALISM AND PRO- TALIBAN SENTIMENT IN HIS RURAL PUNJABI DISTRICT (REFTEL B). TAMMAN DID NO BACKING AWAY FROM HIS EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM TAKING HOLD IN HIS DISTRICT.  HE SAID THE POVERTY IN HIS DISTRICT HAD HELPED ATTRACT CONVERTS TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  AKRAM AWAN, A MIDDLE CLASS LANDLORD AND FOUNDER OF THE RADICAL AKHAN UL MUSLIMIN PARTY, ALSO HAILS FROM HIS DISTRICT. LIKE TARAR HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT, SINCE THE U.S. CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN, THE FORMERLY UNKNOWN OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BECOME A CELEBRITY AND SOMETHING OF A FOLK HERO AMONG THE ORDINARY PEOPLE IN HIS DISTRICT.  11.  (C) SOME OF THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN NOTED BY CONSULATE LAHORE.  PO WAS STRUCK BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FLAGS, BANNERS AND SLOGANS FOR THE JIHADIST LASHKAR-E-TAIBA (LT) HE NOTED IN SAHIWAL DISTRICT DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HARAPPA.  THIS GROUP SPECIALIZES IN RECRUITING YOUNG PUNJABIS TO FIGHT IN KASHMIR.  CONSULATE CONTACTS HAVE ALSO NOTED A CONTINUING STRENGTHENING IN SUPPORT FOR THE SSP IN RURAL PARTS OF KHANEWAL, TOBA TEK SINGH AND MULTAN DISTRICTS.  THE SSP ALSO RECENTLY CAPTURED CONTROL OF THE JHANG MUNICIPALITY (ITS URBAN BIRTHPLACE) ALTHOUGH THE RURAL JHANG HINTERLAND REMAINS FIRMLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE LOCAL SHIA LANDLORD.  ACCORDING TO CONSULATE LAHORE, MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE SSP AND THE LT APPEAR TO BE EXPANDING THEIR SUPPORT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS PARTIES, SUCH AS JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND JAMAAT-ULEMA-I- ISLAM.  12.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD A CLEAR PICTURE OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE BASED ON A SMALL HANDFUL OF CONVERSATIONS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT DEVELOPING IN THE RURAL AREAS.  OUR SENSE, RATHER, IS THAT THE CONTINUING DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IS FUELING A STEADY INCREASE IN THE RECRUITMENT OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE INTO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS LIKE THE SSP IN AREAS OF RURAL PUNJAB (PRIMARILY THE SOUTH) WHERE POVERTY BITES THE HARDEST.  IN RAISING A RED FLAG, TAMMAN IS PROBABLY REACTING MORE TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY OF A LOCAL MILITANT GROUP WITH PRO-TALIBAN SYMPATHIES THAN TO A LARGESCALE INCREASE IN NUMBERS.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE DANGER IS NOT THAT RURAL PUNJAB IS TURNING FUNDAMENTALIST, BUT THAT RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS ARE MAKING INROADS HERE JUST AS IN URBAN AREAS, FRAYING GRADUALLY BUT INEXORABLY AT THE STABILITY OF THE STATE.  13.  COMMENT CONT.  AS FOR THE ALLEGED WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE, OUR INSTINCTS TELL US THIS MAY WELL BE CORRECT, BUT FOR THE REASONS CITED BY TARAR.  SUCH ATTITUDES DO NOT REFLECT RADICAL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT OR EVEN ACTIVIST POLITICAL SUPPORT BUT OPERATE AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, WITH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN VIEWED AS A SUCCESSFUL ISLAMIC ROLE MODELS.  (PUNJABIS, AFTER ALL, ARE MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN KASHMIR THAN IN AFGHANISTAN.)  14.  COMMENT CONT.  NONETHELESS, THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN CAN FUNCTION AS CULTURAL ICONS IS CLEARLY AN INDICTMENT OF THE PAKISTANI POLITICAL CLASS, WHICH HAS MISERABLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EITHER GOOD GOVERNMENT OR POSITIVE ROLE MODELS.  IT IS ALSO AN INDICATION OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS TO ANTI-WESTERN PROPAGANDA, ITSELF NOURISHED BY THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER THE GOODS, BUT REFLECTING ALSO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF YEARS OF WHAT HAS BEEN PERCEIVED HERE AS ANTI-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES.

CLASSIFIED BY PUBLIC DIPLOMACY COUNSELOR RICHARD HOAGLAND FOR REASONS 1.5(D)  2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IT IS OUR IMPRESSION THAT THE USG IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT PROJECTING PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON USAMA BIN LADIN (UBL).  WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WASHINGTON CONSIDER A REVIEW OF THIS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT.  END SUMMARY.  --------------------- PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS ---------------------  2.  (C)  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS:  --  THE PRO-TALIBAN AL-RASHID TRUST IN KARACHI CONTINUES TO CHURN OUT PRO-UBL -- AND CORRESPONDINGLY ANTI-U.S./ANTI-WESTERN -- BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND POSTERS IN URDU, ENGLISH, AND AFGHAN LANGUAGES AT NOMINAL COST OR FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION.  E.G., THE TRUST RECENTLY INTRODUCED A 3' X 2' FOUR- COLOR PRO-UBL POSTER WITH PHOTOS, MAPS, AND IDEOLOGICAL TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR 15 RUPEES, ABOUT 30 CENTS -- JUST A BIT MORE THAN THE COST OF A SIDEWALK HAIRCUT.  THIS POSTER BEAT THE USG'S UBL "WANTED" POSTER TO THE STREET.  --  WE FREQUENTLY HEAR REPORTS THAT SOME IN THE LOWER-MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES, BOTH URBAN AND RURAL, CONSIDER UBL AN ISLAMIC HERO BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS NAMED HIM "PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE."  THAT SAID, IT'S OUR IMPRESSION THAT THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS, AT LEAST IN PAKISTAN, DO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT THIS VIEW.  THE PENDING USG DISTRIBUTION OF UBL "WANTED" POSTERS AND MATCHBOOKS IN PAKISTAN MAY INCREASE UBL'S STATURE AS A KIND OF FOLK HERO.  --  U.S. AND BRITISH EFFORTS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TERRORISTS, LIKE BIN LADIN, AND "GOOD MUSLIMS" ARE SOMETIMES PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA AND BY RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN THEIR WRITINGS AND SERMONS AS ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE ALL MUSLIMS BY CO-OPTING WESTERNIZED -- MEANING (TO THEM) "MORALLY CORRUPT" -- MODERATES.  (NOTE:  THIS REPRESENTS THE PHILOSOPHICALLY ROMANTIC VIEW THAT ISLAM PER SE ERASES ALL DIVISIONS, THAT THE MUSLIM UMMAH IS "ONE," AND THAT AN ATTACK ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.  END NOTE.)  --    IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR ORDINARY EXECRABLE PUBLIC RELATIONS PERFORMANCE ON THE BIN LADEN QUESTION, THE TALIBAN HAVE PRE- EMPTED US CONSISTENTLY SINCE AUGUST, FIRST BY ANNOUNCING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE AFGHANISTAN;S SUPREME COURT EXAMINE THE CHARGES AGAINST BIN LADIN AND THEN BY ANNOUNCING THAT NO "EVIDENCE" (BY WHICH THEY MEANT HARD FACTS IN PROOF OF THE CHARGES) HAD BEEN PRESENTED.  OUR RESPONSE IN EACH CASE WAS MUTED AND DELAYED.  CONTINUING THIS TREND ON THE TALIBAN'S PART, EARLY IN JANUARY, THE TALIBAN SPONSORED A SEMINAR IN KABUL, REPORTED BY RADIO SHARIA, ON THE LIFE, TIMES, AND THOUGHTS OF UBL (REFTEL).   --  ACCORDING TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, PAKISTANI TALIBS WHO HAVE SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN, ALONG WITH AFGHAN TALIBS, ARE BEGINNING TO ENFORCE THEIR DOGMAS AND SOCIAL CONTROLS IN PAKISTAN'S TRIBAL TERRITORIES AND IN SOME PLACES IN BALOCHISTAN AND NWFP PROVINCES.  ALSO, LAST WEEK, THE GOP ENFORCED ISLAMIC LAW BY DECREE IN MALAKAND DIVISION AND IN A PART OF KOHISTAN.  ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED AS YET, THEY SUGGEST A DISTURBING TREND.  INDEED, THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE PAKISTANI CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHING SHARIA AS THE SUPREME LAW OF PAKISTAN -- AN AVOWEDLY HIGH PRIORITY OF THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT -- HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND IS PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE.  -------------------- WHAT SHOULD BE DONE? --------------------  4.  (C) WE ARE UNLIKELY EVER TO MAKE MUCH INROAD WITH UBL'S HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE-BELIEVER ABSOLUTISTS AND TEND TO THINK AND REACT LARGELY EMOTIONALLY:  FACTS ARE LESS IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN EMOTIONS.  THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO PERSUASION.  FURTHER, WE FACE A FORMIDABLE FOE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE CHURNING OUT AND WIDELY DISSEMINATING PRO-UBL PROPAGANDA AND TAKING OTHER ACTIVE MEASURES.  5.  (C) HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LARGE MIDDLE GROUND, IN PAKISTAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN, WHICH IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ANTI- U.S./ANTI-WESTERN AND WHICH IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO UBL AND HIS PAN- ISLAMIST REVOLUTION.  THIS MIDDLE GROUND, SOMEWHAT SUSCEPTIBLE TO REASON, OR AT LEAST TO OTHER INFORMATION, SHOULD BE OUR PRIMARY TARGET.  THE MESSAGE CRAFTED FOR THEM WOULD ALSO BE WELCOMED BY THE EDUCATED, WESTWARD- LOOKING ELITE OF BOTH PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN WHO FEEL THREATENED BY UBL'S ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE AND THEOLOGICAL OBSCURANTISM.  6.  (C) THE FOCUS OF ANY ENHANCED USG PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD BE TO PORTRAY UBL AND OTHERS AROUND HIM AS CRIMINALS, BOTH BY INTERNATIONAL AND BY ISLAMIC STANDARDS. WHERE POSSIBLE, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MOVEMENT "AL-QAIDA" SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED, NOT JUST UBL AS AN INDIVIDUAL.  --  WHEN WE FOCUS ON BIN LADIN, AND ESPECIALLY FOR AFGHAN CONSUMPTION, WE SHOULD MAKE THREE POINTS:  1) THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST AFGHANISTAN AND THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, 2) THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR AFGHAN POLITICAL FACTION, AND 3) THE U.S. WANTS UBL EXPELLED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO A PLACE WHERE HE CAN BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  --  THE BROADER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT COULD INCLUDE, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A "CHARGE SHEET" OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY UBL, BY HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES, AND BY HIS FOLLOWERS, NOTING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEIR VICTIMS HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  --  RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO PROTECT SOURCES AND METHODS AND NOT TO COMPROMISE ON-GOING INVESTIGATIONS AND JUDICIAL PROCESSES, WE SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS, AS WELL AS ABOUT UBL'S AND HIS MOVEMENT'S OTHER CRIMES.  --  THIS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE VALIDATION FROM ISLAMIC SOURCES THAT THESE CRIMES ARE INDEED RECOGNIZED AS CRIMES UNDER ISLAM.  RATHER THAN STATEMENTS BY U.S.- OR UK-BASED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS, IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO USE THE TEACHINGS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF MAJOR ISLAMIC SCHOLARS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, AND ELSEWHERE.  IN SELECTING/ELICITING SUCH CITATIONS, IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND THAT UBL AND THE PAN- ISLAMISTS DISMISS SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT AS ONLY NOMINALLY ISLAMIC STATES CAPTIVE TO U.S.-TOADYING, DESPOTIC, AND APOSTATE LEADERS.  --  KEEPING IN MIND THAT IN HIS DECEMBER 23 INTERVIEW UBL JUSTIFIED KILLING MUSLIMS IN HIS JIHAD AGAINST "CRUSADERS AND JEWS," AND RECOGNIZING THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF OUR TARGET AUDIENCE, WE SHOULD PREPARE FOR DISSEMINATION MORE HUMAN INTEREST STORIES OF UBL'S VICTIMS, ESPECIALLY HIS MUSLIM VICTIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  U.S. MEDIA REPORTS OF BLINDED KENYANS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECEIVED GOOD COVERAGE IN THE PAKISTANI PRINT MEDIA.  7.  (7)  EFFECTIVE METHODS WOULD NATURALLY INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL USG PUBLIC DIPLOMACY TOOLS:  VOA LANGUAGE SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH UBL'S MUSLIM VICTIMS; CAREFULLY TARGETED WORLDNET INTERACTIVES; WIRELESS-FILE TEXTS AND FACT SHEETS FOR TRANSLATION INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES; AND COMMISSIONED ARTICLES FOR PRESS PLACEMENT.  8.  (C) CONSIDERATION COULD ALSO BE GIVEN TO PRODUCTION OF A BOOKLET IN LOCAL LANGUAGES ON THE CRIMES OF BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES, ALONG WITH VICTIMS' STORIES, FOR NON- CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION IN MOSQUES, MADRASSAS, ISLAMIC STUDY CENTERS, ISLAMIA DEPARTMENTS OF UNIVERSITIES, AND BOOKSTORES.  9.  (C) A NON-USG-IDENTIFIED WEB SITE COULD ALSO BE CREATED TO POST THE ABOVE MATERIAL AND THE URL WIDELY DISTRIBUTED.  ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE COUNTER-INTUITIVE -- THAT THE MASSES DON'T USE THE INTERNET -- ALMOST ALL ISLAMIC AND ISLAMIST GROUPS DO INDEED HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND USE IT EXTENSIVELY.

A JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING CONSIDERED THE CASE OF HIJACKER SULIEMAN AL-TURKI ONLY.  ACTION ON AL- TURKI'S DEPORTATION REMAINS PENDING AS THE LIBYAN EMBASSY HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT AL-TURKI IS A LIBYAN CITIZEN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE FURTHER MOVEMENT ON THIS CASE UNTIL AL-TURKI'S ATTORNEY FILES ANOTHER PETITION WITH THE COURT. THE DEPORTATIONS IN QUESTION WOULD BE BACK TO THE DEFENDANTS' CLAIMED COUNTRY OF ORIGIN -- NOT, AT THIS POINT, TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND TRIAL.  2.  (C)  (SUMMARY, CONTINUED)  MEANWHILE, AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM FROM FBI'S WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE ARRIVED ON JANUARY 30 TO CONTINUING THE INTERVIEWING OF WITNESSES AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY PERSONNEL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL PAN AM 73 INVESTIGATION.  THE TEAM WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP ON PREVIOUS FBI REQUESTS FOR ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  3.   (C)  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1986, SIX ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) TERRORISTS HIJACKED PAN AM 73 IN KARACHI.  TWENTY-TWO PASSENGERS WERE KILLED AND 125 WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE HIJACKERS RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY, WHICH WAS THEN REDUCED TO LIFE, AND THEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS (NOW COMPLETED).  ONE OF THE HIJACKERS DIED WHILE IN CUSTODY; THE OTHER FIVE -- SOULIEMAN AL TURKI, MUSTAFA HASSAN SAEED BOMER, MANSOOR AL-RASHID, MUHAMMAD ABDUL KHALIL HUSAIN AL-RAHAYAL AND JAMAL SAEED ABDUL RAHIM AL-FAHID -- REMAIN INCARCERATED IN ADIALA PRISON IN RAWALPINDI.  4.  (C)  THE NATIONALITY OF SEVERAL OF THE HIJACKERS REMAINS IN QUESTION.  BOMER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A JORDANIAN NATIONAL, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT DEPORTATION DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERWAY WITH THE GOJ.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAS NOT YET ACCEPTED AL TURKI'S CLAIM THAT HE IS A LIBYAN.  AL TURKI'S JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING WAS THUS STYMIED; WE EXPECT AL TURKI'S LAWYER TO FILE ANOTHER PETITION FOR RELEASE/DEPORTATION (TIMING UNKNOWN).  THE REMAINING THREE HIJACKERS CLAIM TO BE PALESTINIAN, A CLAIM THAT THE PALESTINIAN EMBASSY HAS THUS FAR REPORTEDLY REJECTED.  5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS AWARE OF THE USG'S INTEREST IN THE FUTURE PROSECUTION OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS.  WE HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE WITH INTERIOR MINISTER HAIDER A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND HE HAS DIRECTED HIS MINISTRY TO ASSIST US WITH OUR REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND WITNESS ACCESS RELATED TO DEVELOPING THE CASE. IN ADDITION, AT THE EMBASSY'S REQUEST, INTERIOR MINISTRY DEPUTY SECRETARY (POLITICAL) HUSSAIN CHAUDRY BRIEFED US ON FEBRUARY 1 ON THE AL-TURKI DEPORTATION HEARING (ONE OF CHAUDRY'S OFFICER HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO ATTEND THE HEARING).  6.  (C)  THE JANUARY 31 HEARING HAD BEEN SPURRED BY A PETITION FILED BY AL TURKI'S ATTORNEY SEEKING IMMEDIATE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY (THE DEFENDANT HAS NOW SERVED TIME IN EXCESS OF 14 YEARS).  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN'S REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA TO ARRANGE FOR SOULIEMAN'S DEPORTATION.  THE GOP REPRESENTATIVE ALSO INFORMED THE JUDGE THAT CONSULAR ACCESS HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY TO MEET WITH THE DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAD NOT YET CONFIRMED AL TURKI'S CITIZENSHIP. ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS, THE JUDGE APPARENTLY DID NOT SPECIFY A TIMEFRAME IN HIS RULING, BUT INSTRUCTED THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN REPRESENTATIVE TO WORK TO EXPEDITE AL TURKI'S DEPORTATION.  7. (C) THE FBI HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PROCESS THE HIJACKERS FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS.  THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN LOCATING AND ARRANGING INTERVIEWS OF A NUMBER OF THE GOP WITNESSES.  THE GOP HAS PROVIDED THE FBI WITH A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE CASE PROPERTY, THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT (FIR) PREPARED ON THE CASE, AND AN UNSIGNED COPY OF A JOINT STATEMENT BY THE HIJACKERS.  8. (C)  THE VISITING FBI WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE TEAM CONTINUES IN ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE (A) COMPLETE COPIES OF INTERROGATION REPORTS PREPARED BY THE PAKISTANI INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE (ISID) FOR EACH OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS; (B)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT; (C)  A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COURT RECORD; (D) INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS OF THE FIVE HIJACKERS; (E)  A DUPLICATE VIDEOTAPE TAKEN OF THE CRIME SCENE; (F)  LEGAL COMMENTS MEMORANDUM DATED 9/6-9/87; AND (G) MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL ADVISOR JAMSHED HAMID.  9.

UNCLAS  ISLAMABAD 008950   S/CT FOR REAP  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PTER, PK SUBJECT: 2003 TERRORISM REPORT FOR PAKISTAN  REF: STATE 301352  A)  Pakistan continues to be one of the United States' most important partners in the Global Coalition against terrorism. Pakistan's military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies are cooperating closely with the U.S. and other nations to identify, interdict and eliminate terrorism at home in Pakistan and abroad.  This includes ongoing efforts to capture and destroy the remnants of al-Qaida and the Taliban that remain in the region.  To date, over 500 suspected operatives of these groups have been successfully apprehended with the cooperation of Pakistani authorities. Among those captured in 2003 were Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a key figure in the events of September 11, and Waleed bin Attash, a prime suspect in the October 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole. The GOP has also demonstrated its resolve by cracking down on previously banned militant organizations that had regrouped under new names, freezing their assets and detaining their leaders.  Along its historically porous border with Afghanistan, Pakistan's military is undertaking operations to capture or kill trans-border terrorists.  In October 2003, security forces achieved notable success in an operation that killed 8 and captured 18 al-Qaida and Taliban in the remote tribal area of South Waziristan Agency.  Pursuant to its obligations under U.N. resolutions 1267, 1390 and 1455 Pakistan continues to work with the U.N. Sanctions Committee to freeze the assets of individuals and groups identified as terrorist entities.  At the same time, Pakistan faces difficult challenges as it does its part in prosecuting the war on terrorism.  The GOP has drafted but has yet to submit to Parliament for approval anti-money laundering legislation, a critical weapon in the terror-fighting arsenal.  Pakistan's beleaguered public education system is a source of concern both from a security standpoint and in terms of the country's future.  Religious schools, offering a limited curriculum and sometimes promoting violent ideologies have stepped in to fill the vacuum.  Reform and investment are urgently needed to broaden curriculum content and revitalize the public education system.  B)  Pakistan's judicial system continues to respond to both international and domestic cases of terrorism.  In 2003, Pakistan continued to use its Anti-Terrorism Courts (created in 1997 to expedite the handling of terrorist cases). Following in the wake of the Daniel Pearl kidnap/murder convictions in 2002, government prosecutors in April 2003 obtained convictions for defendants charged with organizing the bombing of the US Consulate in Karachi the previous year.  Mohammad Imran and Mohammad Hanif both received the death penalty while two accomplices were given life sentences for their roles in the vehicle bomb attack on the Consulate which killed 12 Pakistanis.  In November 2003, the same court handed death sentences to three members of the banned extremist group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, for planning and committing sectarian murders.  Pakistani investigators, as demonstrated in the aftermath of the 2002 church attack in Islamabad that killed two Embassy family members, have shown greater willingness to grant their U.S. counterparts access to evidence.  C)  No Pakistani nationals were formally extradited to the U.S. under the 1931 Extradition Treaty in 2003.  However, the GOP continues to facilitate and has stepped-up the transfer of captured terrorists to U.S. custody.  D)  Impediments to the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists include the lack of centralized databases to collect, process and disseminate timely information leading to criminal convictions.  Pakistan lacks a National Crime Information Center, Department of Motor Vehicles, Social Security System or other database systems commonly used in developed countries.  Sophisticated law enforcement and investigative techniques need greater development as well.  Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism have also been hampered by its delay in passing key anti-money laundering legislation.  In 2002, key anti-money laundering legislation - drafted with U.S. assistance - failed to be enacted.  A revised version has, however, been approved by the Cabinet and is expected to be sent to Parliament.  This legislation is an essential tool in broadening the capacity of Pakistani authorities to monitor suspicious financial transactions. Such legislation will enable law enforcement and financial regulatory agencies to develop the necessary resources and technical infrastructure to pursue sources of terrorist financing.  Despite these hindrances, Pakistan has made a significant step forward with the recent implementation of a central fingerprint repository system which now includes some 70,000 10-print cards. Pakistan's progress with respect to developing the legal and technical infrastructure required to track terrorist financing has been incremental and the USG is encouraging it to do more in this area.  The GOP has taken many important steps to bolster its terror-fighting capabilities.  However, many of its resources are new, untested and will require time to prove their effectiveness.  E)  President Musharraf, Prime Minister Jamali and other senior Pakistani officials have repeatedly condemned terrorism and reaffirmed the government's commitment to putting a stop to it both inside Pakistan and abroad.  There is an understanding at all levels of the government that it is in Pakistan's interest to be a proactive member of the global fight against terrorism.  This commitment has been manifested in the high-level of cooperation the U.S. has received from the GOP in ongoing terrorist investigations in the United States and abroad.  With regard to threats on U.S. soil, such efforts include providing timely intelligence and support to U.S. agencies in identifying and neutralizing terrorist cells.  These efforts play an important role in helping prevent attacks on American citizens, installations and interests.  Pakistan also provides significant assistance in the investigation of international terrorism, acting on leads provided to its counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies by the U.S. and other nations.  In September 2003, Pakistani intelligence and law enforcement agents raided two religious seminaries in Karachi, uncovering a major student terrorist cell.  Those arrested included foreign nationals from Malaysia, Indonesia and Burma.  Following the November 2003 bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in which 21 people died, Pakistan's National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attack and praising President Musharraf's "courageous and consistent support to the war on terrorism."  After the September 11 attacks, Pakistani authorities arrested hundreds of suspected extremists and banned five militant groups.  However, many of the detainees were later quietly released and a number of the organizations resurfaced under new names and became active in 2003. Jaish-e-Muhammmad, for example, reemerged under the name Jamat-ul-Furqan while Lashkar-e-Taiba was reconstituted as Jamaat-ul-Dawa.  Both jihadi groups have been associated with terrorist activity in Kashmir while others are known to promote sectarian violence.  In November 2003, responding to increasing alarm over the active reemergence of these and other extremist groups, the Musharraf government ordered a major crackdown, banning 5 groups:  Jamat-ul-Ansar (formerly Harakat ul-Mujahedin) Jamat-ul-Furqan (formerly Jaish-e-Muhammad) Hizbu-ul-Tahreer (UK-based) Millat-e-Islamia (formerly Sippah-e-Sihaba) Tahreek-e-Pakistan (formerly Tehnik-e-Jafria Pakistan)  A sixth group, Jamaat-ul-Dawa was placed on a "watch list." As part of its actions, the government closed offices, froze assets and detained over 60 individuals.  Although it is too early to determine the duration or effectiveness of these actions, the USG is encouraged by the GOP's willingness to forcefully address the problem.  (F)  In 2003, there has been significant progress in several areas of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to enhance its terrorist-fighting capabilities both within and beyond its borders.  Perhaps the most important development is the implementation of the first federal civilian counterterrorism force, established within the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).  Special Investigation Group (SIG) --------------------------------- Established in late 2002 with U.S. financial and technical assistance, the Special Investigation Group (SIG) is tasked with facilitating a unified investigative response at both the national and provincial levels.  The SIG is comprised of 4 components: intelligence collection, investigations, agency liaison and cyber-terrorism.  On October 7, the SIG graduated 50 officers trained in special counterterrorism techniques. Provincial Criminal Investigation Divisions (PCIDs) in all 4 provinces will create sections to mirror the SIG structure and expand its reach to the regional level.  The SIG and its constituent parts are expected to be fully operational by mid-2004.  The USG and other governments are working closely with the GOP to explore more ways to augment Pakistan's terror-fighting capabilities, particularly in the areas of DNA collection/analysis, post-blast forensics and cyber-terrorism.  Crisis Response Team -------------------- To provide a tactical dimension to Pakistan's counterterrorism program, the USG is now training and equipping Crisis Response Teams (CRT).  Modeled after SWAT teams in the United States, the CRTs are being trained to deal with "high risk" encounters with violent criminals and terrorists.  Central Fingerprint Repository ------------------------------- Pakistan's first central fingerprint repository is being established following Pakistan's conversion to the international standard 10-print card.  A key step forward in aiding authorities to identify terrorists and other criminals, the 10-print card file now holds 70,000 cards. Another 10,000 cards will be added by the end of 2003.  The next step now underway is to procure and install an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), a highly sophisticated data management system that will assist law enforcement agencies to rapidly identify suspects.  Funded by the USG, the system should be operational in 2004.  PISCES ------ The Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES) is now operating at all major international airports in Pakistan and an expansion program is underway to install the system at all official sea and land entry points by the end of 2004.  PISCES technology is helping Pakistan identify wanted criminals and terrorists attempting to transit its borders at official crossing points.  Pakistani authorities report that the system is already yielding results.  Border Security Assistance Program ---------------------------------- The USG remains committed to assisting Pakistan in securing its borders against trafficking in weapons, drugs, and infiltration by terrorists.  Created in 2002, the $73 million dollar Border Security Assistance Program provides aircraft, surveillance technology, communications equipment, transport and training to assist Pakistan in securing its western borders with Afghanistan and Iran.  Related assistance efforts also provide funding for outpost construction and upgrade, training and other commodities.  To date, 183 border personnel have been trained in port-of-entry operations and small unit tactics.  In the previously inaccessible Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), $24 million is being invested in the construction of 400k of roads.  These roads provide critical access to security forces and have the added benefit of assisting in the economic advancement of historically underdeveloped areas.  G)  While the GOP does not overtly support any international terrorist groups, it does provide diplomatic and moral support for Kashmiri militant groups, some of whom are linked to terrorist acts.  There are indications that infiltration across the Line of Control between Pakistani and Indian-held Kashmir continue.  H)  Host government's public statements have been uniformly supportive of our joint efforts in the war against terror.  I)  President Musharraf said recently that Pakistan is at a "critical crossroads," faced with both immense opportunities in the world economy yet burdened by continuing threats from terrorism, religious extremism and sectarianism.  Measured in terms of its public pronouncements and deployment of resources to counter these threats, Pakistan's commitment-level to the war on the terrorism can best be described as steadfast in 2003   POWELL

PASS TO USAID  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2015 TAGS: AEMR, CASC, EAID, MASS, PK, PREL, SENV, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: WHAT THEY NEED  REF: ISLAMABAD 15130  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, B   1.  (c) Summary and Comment:  The scale of devastation from yesterday's earthquake is becoming increasingly clear as information comes in from remote, outlying provinces.  The Government now estimates that the number of fatalities could range between 32,000 and 40,000 -- and possibly more. Villages have been wiped out by the quake itself or by resulting landslides and large areas of the north have been rendered inaccessible by damage to roads.  It is now clear that a sizable, coordinated effort will be needed to provide relief and to support reconstruction.  Having returned from a tour of the north, Musharraf's top priorities are helicopter lift, tents, blankets and medicine. Other donors have joined us in assembling relief packages, but Pakistani officials have made clear that they will need significant helicopter capacity to deliver assistance -- something they will likely need for the foreseeable future and that the United States is uniquely positioned to provide.  Given U.S. interests in Pakistan and the region, it is imperative that we come forward with a substantial and flexible relief package.  We have an opportunity to win considerable goodwill -- particularly within affected populations in the Northern Areas, Pakistani Kashmir and the NWFP -- and to demonstrate that we are a strategic partner they can count on.  In line with our other commitments to Pakistan, we recommend we seize the high ground and be prepared to announce an assistance package of at least $20 million, and be the first off the block to say that we are interested not only in relief, but also rebuilding.  (By way of comparison, we would note that the appropriation for Tsunami relief totaled $901 million.) End Summary and Comment.  The Toll --------  2.  (u) While the GOP is literally digging out from the wreckage of Saturday morning's earthquake -- the worst in Pakistan's recorded history -- it is clear that the scope of Saturday morning's earthquake will be a major humanitarian disaster, far exceeding initial estimates.  On Sunday morning, GOP officials went public with a figure of roughly 18,000 fatalities, but they are telling the international donor community their own estimates are 32,000 fatalities, and they realistically assume that figure could rise to 40,000.  Four million people will be affected by quake damage, split roughly between the North West Frontier Province and Azad Jammu-Kashmir/Northern Areas. International media coverage has focused on discrete incidents of damage and building collapse in the major urban areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore, but it is already clear from phone reports that the scale of devastation is considerably greater in the inaccessible mountainous area near the epicenter, where there are reports of entire villages being leveled by landslides.  Landslides have closed many of the mountain roadways that form the principal means of access to the hill communities near the epicenter; while the GOP optimistically estimates they will reopen most within several days, some of the worst hit could take weeks to repair.  Here in Islamabad, donor coordination has been hampered by an inability to move back into the high rises where many UN bodies and ngo's have their offices, until their structural soundness has been confirmed.  3.  (u) The Embassy and American Citizen community in Pakistan has largely been spared.  Our Consular Section's warden system, as well as a quick check of the hospitals here in Islamabad, has uncovered no American Citizen casualties. We have confirmed that the entire American staff of the Embassy, as well as TDY staff, is unhurt.  We have confirmed that no FSN employees were killed or seriously injured; as best we know, only one FSN family member (the son of the DCM's driver) was killed, in the Azad area near the epicenter.  It appears the Embassy's physical plant -- chancery, residence, housing compound and leased and owned residential properties -- did not sustain significant damage.  Identified Needs ----------------  4.  (u) U.N. agencies are working together to put together a flash appeal for donor contributions that they plan to release on Monday evening.  Our understanding is the flash appeal will focus on relief needs but also contain a preliminary assessment of the reconstruction needs.  The GOP has outlined its near term priorities to the donor community as the following: -- shelter for up to four million affected.  (Embassy Note: the majority of quake damage occurred in a mountainous region where temperatures will drop significantly within about a month.  There will be significant need for winter-weight tents, building supplies, and possibly prefab housing); -- health support -- hospitals (both civil and military), mobile hospitals, surgical supplies, and disease control supplies; -- water (containers, purification equipment and water itself) -- search and rescue support.  5.  (u) In the near term, there is also a need for earth moving equipment to help clear roads to the affected areas. It is possible that the damage will prompt a flow of displaced persons out of the mountains south to the plains around Islamabad and Rawalpindi, in which case supplies to support camps will be needed.  The U.N. country team, led by UNDAC (UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination) has organized itself around the following clusters of priorities, with the indicated body in the lead:  health (WHO) nutrition (UNICEF); water and sanitation (UNICEF), shelter (International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies); logistics (WFP); emergency telecommunications (WFP); protection (UNHCR) and camp management (UNHCR).  U.S. Response to Date ---------------------  6.  (u) On Sunday, the Embassy released a press statement outlining our initial contribution to help Pakistan address this disaster: -- an immediate contribution of $500,000 for emergency relief supplier, to be provided through NGOs -- eight U.S. military helicopters to assist in bringing in emergency relief to communities and villages affected by the earthquake. -- A seven-person Disaster Assistant Response Team (DART), scheduled to arrive on October 10 and 11, which will assess humanitarian needs, assist with targeting and coordination of USG assistance, and provide technical assistance as needed; -- Relief commodities being airlifted to Pakistan from USG stockpiles in the region, including:  250 rolls of plastic sheeting (sufficient for approximately 2,500 families), 5,000 blankets, and 5,000 water containers. -- An ongoing military airlift of other relief supplies. -- U.S.-funded Ministry of Interior Airwing is providing helicopters for aerial relief support. -- Two C-130 aircraft in-bound to Islamabad tonight (October 9) with humanitarian relief supplies.  Other Donors ------------  7.  (u) Most major donors have also made contributions, and have indicated they anticipate providing significantly more as more detailed information becomes available.  Nine countries are sending search and rescue teams (China, Korea, Russia, Turkey, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and the United Arab Emirates).  NGOs working in country, including Save the Children, Mercy Corps and Oxfam, have established an NGO secretariat in Islamabad to coordinate delivery.  Next Steps ----------  8.  (u) Musharraf toured the north today.  His Military Secretary and ISI Director General Kiyani both contacted me  SIPDIS subsequently to convey Musharraf's urgent request for helicopter lift, tents, blankets and medicine. Both were very grateful for CFC-A's quick action to make available eight aircraft.  It is clear, however, that the magnitude of the task will require more assets, and for a prolonged period of time.

ISLAMABAD 15208      B. ISLAMABAD 15130  1.  Summary and introduction:  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) says that it has confirmed 19,136 deaths and 42,397 injuries from the October 8 earthquake; both figures will climb as rescue/recovery efforts continue.  The GOP has centralized disaster relief coordination in the Prime Minister's office, under the leadership of a military officer.  The UN estimates that a population of four million has been directly affected by the earthquake, with one million in the most severly affected zones.  USG assistance -- humanitarian and logistical assistance and eight helicopters to provide airlift -- has begun arriving in Islamabad, and DART disaster assessments are underway.  Post has facilitated press coverage of incoming U.S. assistance and the Ambassador has conducted a series of interviews with major U.S. and international media outlets.  As the GOP has now begun to organize itself to confront the full implications of this disaster, post will focus on determining the specific material and services required for the relief effort.  2.  The U.S. announcement of an initial USD 50 million in relief and reconstruction assistance struck just the right chord.  The Vice Chief of Army Staff Gen. Hayat telephoned the Ambassador to express the GOP's gratitude for the contribution and the arrival of U.S. helicopters for air lift support.  Having just returned from a tour of affected areas, LTG Hayat indicated that Pakistan will require as many helicopters as possible for an indefinite period, as areas north of Mansehra and Muzzafarabad are inaccessible by road. In Gen. Hayat's words, "the U.S. offer of assistance has given both the Pakistani military and public a huge psychological boost," so much so that it is now possible to imagine that the country will pull through this crisis.  End summary and introduction.  GOP and NGO Relief Efforts --------------------------  3.  Disaster Relief Structure:  Coordination for relief efforts is now centered in the Prime Minister's office, under the leadership of MG Faruk.  Thus far, the military has been the most visible agency on relief efforts, with other government agencies scrambling to get in the game.  The MFA and other agencies have established task force-style coordination centers.  Activity has shifted out to the airport, where the Interior Ministry has relocated its National Crisis Management Cell and other agencies are sending out liaison officers.  Various political parties have established relief funds; prominent politicians are following President Musharraf's lead in making large public donations to earthquake relief.   4.  Donor Coordination:  Post will report on GOP outreach to the donor community septel.   USG Assistance - October 10, 2005 ---------------------------------  5.  USAID Response:  A IL-76 carrying Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) relief supplies arrived in Islamabad midday October 10.  Save the Children was positioned with trucks to transport the cargo (Blankets, plastic sheeting, water cans).  Disaster Assistance Reaction Team (DART) team leader arrived at post on October 9 and has been assessing damage; the remainder of the team will arrive October 11 and 12.  6.  Military Assets:  The Office of the Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) has coordinated the arrival of the following U.S. military assets:  -- One (1) C-17 arrived early morning October 10, carrying relief supplies (Halal MREs, blankets, water), as well as a 10-ton fork lift and two (2) enlisted cargo handlers who have remained to off-load relief planes at Islamabad/Chaklala Airport.  -- Eight (8) helicopters from CFC-A arrived midday, but did not fly any relief missions today.  Helo crews will receive relief missions assignments on October 11, per coordination with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) air operations center.  -- Two (2) C-17s from McGuire AFB will arrive on October 10 carrying a 23-person Contingency Response Team and airfield management equipment.  -- One (1) C-17 out of Kuwait will arrive late October 10 carrying blankets, medical supplies and water.  -- One (1) C-130 out of Bahrain will arrive late October 10 carrying RDML Lefevere and a humanitarian coordination team.  7.  CFC-A Coordination:  CFC-A Commander LTG Eikenberry arrived in Islamabad midday for consultations with Embassy and GOP officials.  The GOP has accepted an offer of four helicopters by the Government of Afghanistan (GOA); CFC-A will provide support for the Afghan helos and ODRP will provide ground support to the crews while in Pakistan.  8.  NAS Assistance:  Early on October 10, post's Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) dispatched seven (7) vehicles and drivers to Manshera to assist with transportation needs at the request of the District Coordinating Officer.  The Ministry of Interior Air Wing, a joint NAS-GOP program, remains engaged in aerial relief support.  NAS helos have transported British search-and-rescue teams to remote areas and flown DART/Bill Berger on an aerial surveillance mission of the Muzzafarabad area.  Public Diplomacy ----------------  9.  Ambassador Crocker has given telephone interviews for the Monday morning shows on ABC, Fox, CNN and BBC Radio (UK and World Service).  The GOP has facilitated access by international media access to both the civilian and military sides of the Islamabad airport, allowing video and camera coverage of incoming international assistance, including the arrival of USG relief flights.  Post has distributed copies of the October 9 Statement by the White House Press Secretary to local media and to GOP officials.    CROCKER

(SBU) Summary and Introduction:  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) now has a firmer grasp on managing relief efforts, but still faces coordination problems between its civilian and military leaders.  The Prime Minister's coordination center is considering a USG proposal to have embassy liaison officers assigned to its working groups; If the GOP agrees, the liaison team will assist the GOP as it determines its assistance requirements and reconstruction needs.  U.S. military and civilian helicopters are flying dozens of sorties, transporting relief workers and supplies to the affected areas.   U.S. military planes are arriving with humanitarian assistance cargo, but the number of incoming flights has been limited by the capacity of the Chaklala air field to manage a flood of international relief flights.  The GOP is still grappling with how it will manage and distribute donor contributions, but is open to U.S. offers of technical assistance.  Despite a generally positive assessment of the GOP's management of the crisis thus far by NGOs and international relief coordinators, a frustrated Pakistani public is beginning to criticize the GOP for a slow and inadequate response to the millions traumatized by the earthquake.  End summary and introduction.  GOP Relief Coordination -----------------------  2. (SBU)  In a morning meeting with the Prime Minister's Disaster Relief Coordination Group, Embassy officials briefed the PM's Additional Secretary Zamir Akram on USG assistance on the ground and in the pipeline.  Post representatives also outlined the other assistance that the U.S. could offer Pakistan.  Akram said that the GOP has a good idea of the extent of the devastation in urban areas, but does not have a clear grasp of the situation in outlying areas. Akram broke assistance requirements into two categories:  immediate needs through late October (shelter; pre-cooked food, dry rations; bottled water and water purification tablets; medical supplies), followed by medium-term materiel (pre-fab housing; winterized tents; warm clothing).  Akram responded favorably to the Embassy's offer of disaster relief planning teams, logistic planning and tracking capability; and coordinating offers of assistance with assessed needs.  The GOP is considering an Embassy offer to assign liaison officers to work directly with the Disaster Coordination Group (and sub-groups); post has identified a four-person interagency liaison team that would be available to support the Coordination Group on site. The embassy liaisons have already passed a complete menu of available USG assistance for the GOP to consider at its federal-level interagency coordination meeting Wednesday morning, post expects that the Coordination Group will pass back the GOP's preferences by midday October 12.  3. (SBU)  Illustrating the close cooperation that is developing between USG agencies and GOP relief coordinators, the Pakistan Army today sent the Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) detailed reports on Pak relief sorties, incoming assistance, loads shifted, etc., along with maps of supply lines and photos.  Post has forwarded these reports to Task Force-1 via email.  USG Relief Flights - Military -----------------------------  4. (S) ODRP reports that two (2) C-130s and three (3) C-17s carrying relief supplies and personnel will have arrived in Pakistan on October 11.  The military airport at Chaklala is operating at full capacity, leading the Pakistani Air Force (PAF) to restrict, for a time, fixed wing aircraft to nighttime take-offs/landings, reserving day-light hours for rotary wing craft.  PAF difficulties in managing incoming traffic have led to delays in the arrival of other U.S. aircraft originally scheduled to arrive today. 5. (S) The eight (8) U.S. Army helicopters that arrived October 10 began flying sorties at first light on October 11, completing 14 sorties (7 sorties returned to Chaklala due to adverse weather conditions).  The helos transported 223 passengers, more than 32,000 lbs. of supplies, and returned 102 evacuated casualties to Islamabad.  Four (4) MI-17s from the Afghan National Army, which arrived in the afternoon, will be ready to join the U.S. helos on missions tomorrow. Two German helicopters have also arrived and will be folded into the U.S. operation.  6. (S) ODRP reported that there are requests pending for ten (10) CH-53s, ten (10) UN-60s, and 4-6 medevac helos.  If approved, the estimated time of arrival in Pakistan would be at least a week.  USG Relief Flights - NAS ------------------------  7. (SBU)  Post's Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) Air Wing (a joint project with the Ministry of Interior) helicopters flew five (5) HU-60s for 15 sorties, including airlifting a Japanese medical team and their supplies to Battagaram, Following a request from the Swiss Embassy, NAS will work on providing airlift to the four-person Swiss relief team and their supplies from Mansehra to a location further north. NAS helo teams are working flat out; with indications that the GOP may begin allowing night missions, NAS' problem will be managing crew rest and a pilot shortage.  Donor Coordination ------------------ 8. (U)  Given persistent communication gaps between GOP military and civilian relief coordinators, USG agencies may have a better grasp of the nexus between donor contributions, incoming assistance and its distribution.  USAID/OFDA are in close contact with NGOs on the ground, and the UN is continuing daily coordination meetings with donors and NGOs.   In a meeting with USAID and DART representatives today, the MOF previewed a GOP's proposal to task the Prime Minister's Coordination Group with immediate relief efforts, then transferring long-term reconstruction oversight to the MOF. The U.S. officials suggested the inherent disconnects that could follow if relief efforts are not closely knitted to eventual reconstruction, and offered other models for the GOP to consider.  USAID and DART will meet again with the MOF and other bilateral donors tomorrow.   9. (SBU)  Both the UAE and Kuwait have announced donations of USD 100 million to assist Pakistan, with Kuwait's offer split evenly between concessionary loans and cash.  Post will carefully monitor how the GOP elects to use these funds and stands ready to offer assistance.  (Note:  We would welcome updates from Embassy Abu Dhabi and Embassy Kuwait on the donors' disbursement plans.  End note.)  Private donors have also stepped up:  The U.S.-Pakistani Business Council has already donated USD 100,000; Boeing has advised that they will announce a USD 1 million donation on October 12; and the Coca-Cola Company/Coca-Cola Foundation have pledged USD 1 million to Pakistani relief efforts and USD 1 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.   Shifting Public Mood -------------------- 10. (SBU)  In an echo of U.S. public reaction in the days following Hurricane Katrina, Pakistani public opinion starting to turn against President Musharraf and the government for not reacting swiftly enough to the crisis, particularly as bad weather (severe thunderstorms accompanied by hail), equipment shortages and blocked roads hamper the government's relief efforts  Survivors' expectations for immediate response have not been matched by actual delivery. Sporadic episodes of looting and raids on relief centers only add to survivors' feelings of vulnerability.  The Pakistani and international press are increasingly airing reports critical of the President and the government's efforts.  For example, Survivors in Muzzafarabad and NWFP asked why rescue teams did not arrive in their regions until Monday, complaining that the GOP bureaucracy had been paralyzed in day-long coordination meetings.  Keenly sensitive to criticism, the government has defended its efforts, pointing to the numerous obstacles to transporting relief to remote mountainous regions. The President, Prime Minister and Army spokesperson have all appeared on national television, assuring Pakistani that the government is deploying all its assets to assist those in need.  Ironically, the consensus in the NGO community is that the GOP response to the earthquake has been relatively good -- a perspective shared by this Embassy.  CROCKER

(U)  Summary:  Pakistan's political parties are mobilizing their own relief/recovery operations for victims of the South Asian earthquake.  All have promised to send funds, supplies, and teams to the affected areas and several are setting-up independent relief camps.  In addition, Kashmiri militant/terrorist organizations and Pakistani sectarian extremist groups have initiated their own fundraising drives and relief operations ostensibly to benefit earthquake survivors.  End Summary.  2. (U) While public criticism of the GOP response to the October 8 earthquake has increased, political parties have taken a largely constructive line.  In parliament, leaders of all parties pledged not to try and score political points off the national tragedy and promised to cooperate in an effort to help victims.  Members of the National Assembly voted unanimously to donate the equivalent of a month's salary each to a National Assembly fund to help earthquake victims.  The Senate is expected to follow suit.  The opposition cancelled its long-planned anti-government demonstrations for October 12.  However, provincial leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) have not uniformly followed the cooperative national line with several publicly criticizing the slow pace of GOP relief.  3. (U) Cooperation between parties in administering aid, however, is noticeably lacking.  The Pakistan Muslim League (PML), PPP, and PML-N have all established separate relief funds to assist earthquake victims.  All intend to establish relief camps in the hardest hit areas, and PML has already set-up a national camp at its headquarters in Islamabad.  The Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) has dispatched a team of doctors to the earthquake zone and has promised to send additional relief teams.  4. (U) The Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F) are providing support to NWFP and Azad Kashmir victims of the earthquake through their respective charitable arms, the al-Khidmat Foundation and the al-Khair Trust.  JI leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed has been critical of the size of initial pledges from western donors and has demanded that the Pakistan military not participate in relief operations as it "has lost the trust of the Pakistani people."  5. (SBU) Jamaat-ud-Dawa (parent organization of the designated FTO Lashkar-e-Tayyaba), which has an already-established social development program in Azad Kashmir and NWFP, has promised to provide relief assistance to victims, including supplies and medical relief.  Similarly Jamaat-ul-Ansar (an alias of designated FTO Harakat ul-Mujahidin) and Hizbul Mujahidin (a Kashmiri militant group) have pledged supplies, funds, and personnel for relief operations in Azad Kashmir.  Sectarian extremist organizations Sunni Tehrike and Sipah-i-Sahaba have both established funds to support earthquake victims.  It is unclear how these will be used to provide relief.  6. (C) Comment:  With public opinion increasingly critical of the perceived slow-pace of the GOP response, opposition leaders have decided there is little to be gained by involving themselves directly in a political confrontation. Qazi's statements aside, their decision to "cooperate" in the national interest has been uniformly praised.  While the parties' relief operations are likely to remain small and uncoordinated, such humanitarian activism is seen as a routine and necessary extension of "constituent services," which are critical to votes.

(A) HUNT/TASKFORCE E-MAIL 10/12/05      B. (B) ISLAMABAD 15278 AND PREVIOUS NOTAL  1. (SBU) Summary and introduction: Relief supplies and assistance teams are beginning to reach affected areas even as transportation remains a serious on-going problem.  There is great concern that deteriorating weather conditions -- snow has already begun falling in parts of Kashmir -- may exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.  Emergency shelter remains a top, largely unmet priority.  Raids of relief convoys and distribution centers by locals in the earthquake zone demonstrate growing frustration with delays in provision of supplies.  The GOP coordination effort remains hampered by a hierarchical structure and failure to adopt an open engagement policy with donors.  Public sentiment nationwide continues to shift against the Government of Pakistan (GOP), as images of human suffering bombard the media.  Criticism of international relief efforts is growing with public figures chastising the lack of airlift support and the lack of response from Muslim countries.  President Musharraf took advantage of Secretary Rice's October 12 visit to Pakistan to publicly thank the U.S. for its generosity and steadfastness as Pakistan faces this major crisis.  The Secretary assured the President and the people of Pakistan that the U.S. would provide both immediate relief assistance and long-term reconstruction support.  End summary and introduction.  GOP Efforts -----------  2. (U) The Pakistan military remains the focal point for relief operations and continues to transport relief supplies and humanitarian teams to the worst-affected areas.  Limited airlift capability (essential to reach many remote areas), crowded roads, and attacks on relief convoys by frustrated victims continue to hamper this process.  Military and civilian officials remain concerned about inadequate stocks of tents and plastic sheeting for temporary shelter in impacted areas.  With winter approaching, there is a real concern that deteriorating weather conditions could further imperil earthquake survivors.  Police and civilian medical personnel have been detailed from unaffected areas of the country to support military relief operations, although shortages in certain areas such as surgeons and paramedics reportedly remain.  Collection of domestic funds and relief supplies continues with reasonable success.  Relief supplies collected by district government in unaffected areas are making their way to Islamabad for onward distribution.  Many organizations are channeling contributions to the President's Relief Fund.  The exception to this rule has been political parties, many of which have established their own collection drives.  3. (C) A 29-member Federal Earthquake Relief Cell, located in the Prime Minister's Secretariat and chaired by MG Farooq Ahmed Khan, comprises of all relevant sectors of the civilian and military bureaucracies.  The cell is intended to be the nucleus of the central civil-military operations center for which post and other donors have been pressing.  The GOP has declined, however, to convene this cell in a central location to allow donors periodic access to the members.  Donors must instead liaise individually with the designated sectoral points of contact.  Decision-making on assistance proposals remains hierarchical, with proposals reviewed during a daily 0900 meeting of the cell.  Those given preliminary approval will be referred to more senior decision-making levels. Despite the Embassy's urging, the GOP has not adopted  a collaborative, on-the-spot decision-making model.  The Prime Minister's Office, however, has welcomed regular engagement with the USG on relief efforts, establishing a daily 1100 meeting with Embassy liaisons to discuss and coordinate relief operations.  (Comment:  This level of engagement will not get the job done. Post's designated interlocutor at these 1100 meetings,  Additional Secretary Imtiaz, has so far failed to respond to any of the proposals or questions put forward by our liaisons.  DCM and Embassy liaisons met with MG Farooq after COB October 12th to raise our concerns about the need for better communication from the GOP on matching USG resources to the GOP's needs.  MG Farooq offered the Embassy direct access to his deputy -- also a Gen. Farooq -- who offered to join the edaily 1100 meetings.  End comment.)  USG Relief Efforts ------------------  4. (C) DOD continues to deliver regular supplies of tents, medical supplies, water, and meals ready-to-eat through Chaklala airbase in Islamabad.  The schedule of twice daily C-17 and C-130 flights will need to continue for the foreseeable future, although the Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) is working with Pakistani military to improve airfield efficiency so that more flights can get in each day.  Post has e-mailed ODRP reports of daily operations directly to Department's Task Force-1.  5. (SBU) The Ministry of Health has agreed to accept three (3) U.S. military field hospitals for the duration of the crisis, including staffing assistance from U.S. military personnel.  While the GOP has yet to identify specific personnel needs, the Ministry of Health believes that surgeons and paramedics top the list of those specialties required.  The Prime Minister's Office has promised to provide a list of priority deployment sites likely on October 13.  The GOP recognizes that there is a 4-5 day ship-deliver-operation lag time on these items.  6. (U) The USAID/DART team is now in-country following flight delays and is up-and-running.  All assistance items provided in the initial USAID airlift have been distributed through Save the Children.  Post believes that it is essential for USAID to identify and provide additional assistance on a priority basis in order to increase the civilian side of USG earthquake relief.  DART anticipates arrival in coming days of a second cargo flight of relief supplies, including 1500 tents, 5000 blankets, plastic sheeting, WHO health kits designed to serve 100,000 patients, two water treatment units and 5000 water containers; USAID has also transferred USD 9.3 million in response to the UN Flash Appeal and has increased the grant to the IFRC to USD 2 million.  Corporate Donations -------------------  7. (SBU)  Each of the sixty members of the American Busines Council in Karachi will contribute Rupees 100,000 (a total of approximately USD 100,000).  Many members are making additional contributions through their U.S. headquarters or foundations, including Citibank (USD 4 million), Coca-Cola (USD 2 million), Boeing (USD 1 million), Pfizer (USD 1 million), Caltex (USD 300,000), IBM (USD 50,000) and El Paso Energy (USD 50,000).  Other firms are making in-kind contributions:  medical supplies (Abbott Labs, Johnson and Johnson, Becton Dickinson, Pfizer), tents (Gillette), food (Sheraton) and software support (IBM).   Proctor and Gamble (which manufactures PuR water purification sachets in Pakistan for worldwide distribution) has given 500,000 sachets to NGOs for distribution in affected areas.  (Note: Please protect information on these donations, as several of these companies have not yet made public announcements.  End note.)  USG Distribution Support ------------------------  8. (U) Distribution of relief supplies by air is critical in isolated parts of Kashmir and NWFP.  USG military air assets in-country consist of 5 CH-57s and 3 UH-60s (as of 1200 October 12).  Four (4) MI-17s from the Afghan National Army, which flew ten sorties on October 12.  These air assets are supplemented by the Joint Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) - Ministry of Interior Air Wing consisting of 5 UH-60s.  All air assets have been fully committed ferrying relief supplies and teams during daylight hours on October 11 and 12. Mission priorities are determined by the Pakistan military. Fixed wing air traffic control and aircraft support are being provided by a self-contained team deployed from McGuire AFB now operational at Chaklala Air Base.  Pakistan military is considering nighttime operation of rotary-wing aircraft. There is also discussion of establishing a second operations base for U.S. rotary wing aircraft at PAF Minhas.  9. (C) GOP continues to seek additional helicopter support from the USG.  Twenty (20) CH-47 helicopters are scheduled to arrive at Baghram in approximately two days for deployment in Pakistan within a week.  ODRP, in coordination with CENTCOM and CFC-A, is considering other sources of helo support to propose to the PAF, including four (4) State Department/INL MI-17s in Afghanistan and Tajikistan national MI-17s.  10. (C) During his October 12 meeting with CFC-A LTG Eikenberry, VCOAS Hayat agreed to ODRP's proposal to air drop rations into remote areas not presently accessible by road. High population density in some areas will complicate planning and force protection; drops will be possible only in areas where the Pakistan military has sufficient personnel on the ground to clear a drop site.  Planning for these missions is underway; missions could begin as early as October 13.  Public Perception -----------------  11. (U) Public anger over the GOP's perceived inability to meet humanitarian needs in the affected areas continues to grow.  There appears to be a widespread belief that the GOP is not doing enough to ensure expeditious delivery of relief supplies.  This sentiment is fueled by media reporting, interviews, and photographs displaying clearly-suffering individuals in the assistance zones.  In affected areas, frustrated individuals have attacked and looted relief convoys and distribution centers and have attempted to forcibly board relief aircraft with the objective of evacuation.  Public figures have also initiated criticism of international relief efforts, calling for additional helicopters to support air lift operations.  Some commentators also took Muslim countries, in particular, to task for failing to respond rapidly and sufficiently.  12. (U)  Mindful of public frustrations, President Musharraf took advantage of the press presence at the top of his October 12 meeting with Secretary Rice to praise the strong U.S. response to Pakistan's appeal for international assistance.  (Note:  Full reporting of the Secretary's meetings in Pakistan will be forwarded septel.  End note.) He thanked the United States for its pledge of an initial USD 50 million in relief and reconstruction assistance, noting that he highlights U.S. air lift and material support when travels to affected areas of Kashmir and NWFP.  The Secretary assured the President that the U.S. would support the Pakistani people through this crisis, starting with emergency relief and continuing through long-term reconstruction of the devastated regions.

(C) Summary: The GOP and the Pakistan military have faced substantial media and public criticism, much of it unjustified, for their perceived ineffectiveness in earthquake response.  Musharraf's public address on October 12, a damage control exercise, was overshadowed by continued media images, interviews, and commentary on victims who are still without meaningful assistance.  The opposition parties, sensing a vulnerability, have joined the attacks and sought to portray themselves as constructive players in national relief efforts.  With damage concentrated in Azad Kashmir and North West Frontier Province (NWFP), there is a near term possibility that resentment at the central government may fuel the Kashmiri independence movement and Pashtun nationalist calls for increased provincial autonomy.  Over the medium-term, however, if reconstruction efforts are adequately funded and executed in these areas, government authority and credibility may be enhanced.  End Summary.  2. (C) International aid agencies and NGOs believe that the GOP and the Pakistan military have conducted a largely credible relief operation despite significant logistical challenges and infrastructure limitations.  This assessment is not widely shared in the Pakistani public or media. Images and stories of victims in dire need continue to flood the pages and television screens of an increasingly skeptical public.  Reported verbal abuse of Pakistani military and government personnel arriving in affected villages, coupled with stories and images of desparate survivors looting relief convoys and distribution points, adds to the perception of government paralysis.  The media has been demonstrating that it is completely free, but less than fully responsible.  For example, local journalists stationed at Chaklala Airbase in Islamabad report a chaotic scene, with the Pakistani military unable to prioritize assistance missions for timely delivery of aid and no visible decisionmaking chain-of-command.  In fact, the whole operation at Chaklala is running well, as the international media seems to be portraying today.  The absence of an effective media/public relations strategy within the GOP, coupled with the military's long-standing reluctance to provide operational information to journalists, plays into the hands of critics.  The Ambassador joined the Pakistan Army's air chief at Chaklala this morning for a Pakistan TV interview to set the record straight.  3. (C) To blunt criticism of GOP relief operations, President Musharraf addressed the nation on October 13.  While the speech contained some detail on military relief operations and praised international donor assistance, most commentators remained unmoved.  Media analysts charged that Musharraf came across as defensive when he articulated logistical challenges in aid delivery and appeared to open the military to additional criticism when he stated that 72-hours had been necessary to arrange for full mobilization.  4. (C) Nevertheless, Musharraf himself has been generally viewed in a favorable light during the crisis.  He continues to project an aura of leadership in meetings with foreign officials and relief workers and during well-publicized tours of the earthquake zone.  His astute political decision to create, in relatively short order, military and civilian relief cells that answer to others in the GOP, may allow him to shift future blame to other institutions, particularly the Prime Minister's Office and the military command.  5. (C) Prime Minister Aziz's image has suffered, despite tours of the earthquake zone and significant personal monetary donations.  Aziz lacks the leadership persona of Musharraf and has frequently seemed overwhelmed.  The Prime Minister is not helped by a bureaucracy that has done little other than designing numerous organigrams for relief operations and establishing multiple cabinet-level relief committees, few of which have delivered results.  The public perception has been of a Prime Minister (and government) involved in endless meetings while victims suffer.  Aziz, who has faced opposition within his party and government almost from the day he assumed office, may well end up as the government's scapegoat.  6. (C) The public welcomed the decision to appoint the military as lead agency for disaster response, but had unrealistic expectations of its capabilities.  (Note:  The military has always enjoyed a much higher level of trust than the civilian bureaucracy.)  The slow pace of relief delivery, an inevitable result of the scope of the disaster and the inaccessability of the terrain, undermined confidence. Military personnel in the disaster zone have been verbally abused, and commanders are under constant media scrutiny. General Farooq, the military's Disaster Relief Coordinator has explained publicly and privately that the area of devestation coincided with the area of the army's deployment in Kashmir leading to significant military casualties that hindered its rapid response capability.  7. (C) The media has carried positive stories of the opposition (both secular and Islamist) dispatching relief supplies and assistance teams to the affected areas.  The decision to conduct relief efforts independently through the parties' existing charitable foundations arguably sacrifices efficiency in an effort to gain political advantage.  In contrast, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League's decision to focus its efforts on the President's Relief Fund has inextricably linked its efforts with the GOP.  The opposition's decision to refrain from vocal criticism of GOP efforts has allowed its leadership to appear constructive players.  NWFP Chief Minister Durrani's decision to attend, for the first time, the National Security Council meeting on October 12 to discuss earthquake relief allowed parties to seem above partisan squabbling.  8. (C) Comment:  The most severely earthquake-impacted areas, Kashmir and the NWFP, viewed themselves as isolated from the central government prior to this tragedy.  The GOP has steadfastly maintained the fiction of an autonomous Azad Kashmir government and in the NWFP calls for increased political autonomy are a well-established tradition.  In the near-term, public unhappiness over the relief effort could fuel both Pashtun and Kashmiri nationalist movements and give additional platforms to their principal advocates the Awami National Party (ANP), the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman, and the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front.  However, over the medium term, if reconstruction efforts are adequately funded and executed, the GOP is likely to weather the storm and may come out ahead.  Indeed, a massive, GOP-led reconstruction effort could ultimately help bind both regions more tightly to Pakistan.  End Comment. CROCKER

(C)  Summary and introduction:  Relief efforts in Pakistan are pushing forward, as the government begins to implement a coherent Concept of Operations for managing its response to the crisis.  The U.S. has received diplomatic clearance to double its milair relief flights into Islamabad, and additional U.S. helicopters arrive each day to join the mission.  Even with the ramp up in relief operations, many areas hit by the October 8 earthquake remain inaccessible to relief workers.  U.S. C-130s began air-drops of rations to survivors in these remote areas.  Military coordinators are now considering whether some U.S. air assets should redeploy to alternative air fields, as operations at the Qasim and Chaklala sites are reaching saturation.  The UN and NGO relief continues to move forward, but coordination with the government remains a challenge.   The press continues to berate the government for an inadequate response to the crisis, with some actually suggesting that the failure to reach victims in remote areas as "politically-motivated neglect."  (Note:  In a meeting in which the Ambassador urged the government to proactively engage the media, he repeated this baseless characterization to National Security Advisor Tariq Aziz.  After a moment of stunned silence, Aziz replied, with perfect comedic timing,"That's nonsense -- the region voted PML" (i.e. , for President Musharraf's party).  End note.)  No AMCIT Casualties -------------------  2.  (SBU)  The Embassy has not had any reports of American citizens killed or injured.  Consular officers have cleared eleven (11) welfare-and-whereabouts inquiries as of October 13; they are following up on two additional inquiries received October 14.  U.S. Relief Flights and Helicopter Operations ---------------------------------------------  3.  (C)  The Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) scored a major victory today, obtaining blanket diplomatic clearance for eight (8) U.S. milair flights daily, doubling the number the USG had earlier in the week.  Five flights came in on October 13, carrying tents, cots, rations, maintenance parts.  The  Contingency Response Group (CRG) at Chaklala airfield is doing well and is lashed up with the Pakistan Air Force.  The CRG was able to dramatically improve the efficiency of the airfield's cargo operations by connecting two NGO workers who have worked for DHL to Pakistani logistics officers:  the NGO/DHL workers showed the Pakistanis the advantages of getting cargo onto pallets and quickly converted a haphazard operation into an organized, efficient warehouse.  In another stroke of serendipity, CRG cargo handlers came to the rescue when an IL-76 bearing Iranian relief supplies could not find a Pakistani team to off-load its cargo; a photo of the U.S. ground crew unloading the Iranian supplies made the morning papers.  4.  (C)  Task Force Griffen conducted seventy-six helicopter sorties, conveying 208,680 pounds of relief supplies and 675 injured passengers. Two Navy CH-53s arrived at Qasim AFB on October 13.  Twenty CH-47s are still on schedule to arrive in staggered flows in Baghram over the next fourteen (14) days. On the State side, two (2)INL-sponsored MI-8s from Kabul due in Pakistan on October 14 have been delayed at least one day, as the Bulgarian and Tajikistani firms from whom the helos are leased must seek national government approval to transfer the assets to Pakistan.  Pieces Falling Together:  GOP Concept of Operations --------------------------------------------- ------  5.  (SBU)  In post's morning meeting with Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Relief Commission (FRC) BG Farooq, USG liaisons received a presentation outlining the GOP's Concept of Operations for the relief effort.  (Note:  Post has emailed the full presentation to Task Force-1.  End note.) The liaison team will reciprocate on October 14 by giving the FRC an outline of how the U.S. military can support the GOP Concept of Operations.  Once approved by the GOP, the U.S. military response will be knitted together with the Pakistani concept.  Post liaisons will then weave support from U.S. civilian agencies (DART, USAID, etc.), the UN and NGOs into the fold.  6.  (C)  The GOP has identified three sites (Rawalkot, Muzzafarabad and Mansehra) as potential forward operating bases, from which relief supplies would be transported.  An U.S. military engineering assessment team arrived in Islamabad October 13 and will assess the roads to these three sites on October 14 to determine where they are clear and capable of supporting a steady flow of supply conveys.  Air Drops ---------  7.  (C)  The U.S. military currently has 51 pallets of food, water and blankets ready at Baghram air field to supply air drops from C-130s to earthquake survivors in areas relief teams cannot access by road.  Military assessment teams in Blackhawks conducted surveys of possible drop zones on October 12, but the situation of these isolated survivors is so desperate that Pakistani military officials have requested that the U.S.conduct blind drops.  Ambassador supports this position.  U.S. C-130s air drop operations should begin on October 14.  Alternate Air Bases -------------------  8.  (C)  After some confusion as to the genesis of the concept of establishing a separate base of operations for Task Force Griffen (Note:  As a result of a communication garble, the USG thought that the GOP came up with the idea of moving U.S. milair flights to a designated air field, while the GOP believed that the USG had formally requested a separate air field.  End note.)  U.S. military planners are now examining whether it makes sense to move some U.S. air assets to alternate bases, as operations at Qasim and Chaklala are reaching capacity.  Coordinating with Other Donors -------------------------------  9.  (C)   The UN Disaster Assistance Center (UNDAC) has now organized sector cluster groups, which are establishing websites to improve coordination.  A UN Humanitarian Information Center team should be set up by October 14.  Post representatives at the daily UNDAC coordination meeting came away concerned that there is no comprehensive picture of the distribution of relief supplies.  ODRP will try to link the UN and NGOs into Pakistani military channels in order to improve tracking of the movement of humanitarian relief materials.  Another emboff officer attending the October 13 UNDAC meeting reported a dramatic change in atmosphere from the previous day, with NGO representatives increasingly frustrated by a lack of coordination with the GOP.  Relief agencies cannot get slots for flights to bring in relief cargoes.  The GOP sent an unprepared MFA officer to the October 13 session, rather than the officials who had participated the day before.  The MFA officer had no answers to the NGOs' questions, saying only that he would try to have responses by the following day.  UN U/SYG Jan Egeland arrived October 13; in public statements calling for the international community to increase its assistance, he indirectly suggested that the Pakistani relief effort was failing.  Return to Muzzafarabad ----------------------  10.  (SBU) An emboff who had been in the devastated city of Muzzafarabad October 11 returned two days later to find a city reborn:  people on the streets, tractors and other earth-moving equipment moving about, volunteer relief workers from Pakistan proper distributing food supplies from Sindh from the back of jingle trucks.  Much of the credit for this transformation goes to the Punjabi police, who arrived late October 12 and immediately began to restore order amongst chaos.   11.  (U)  Kabul minimize considered.

Summary:  A USG survey team consisting of personnel from State, USAID, and DOD visited Muzzafarabad and surrounding areas of Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) from October 11-13.  During the visit, the team met with officials from the local and AJK government, the Pakistani military, and relief workers to assess needs and relief efforts in the aftermath of the October 8 earthquake. All interlocuters believed that the immediate need was shelter for the ensuing 3 to 4 months followed by a permanent water supply.  By the fourth day following the earthquake, most of those with life-threatening injuries had been evacuated. Medical personnel felt that re-establishing electricity and running water was critical to preventing and treating disease.  Relief efforts by the Pakistani military, local government, Pakistani population and the international community were enormous, but coordination could be drastically improved.  Relief officials believed that the major focus of disaster response efforts should now shift to communities surrounding Muzzaffarabad. End summary.  A Long Way to Normalcy ======================  2. The one thing that all interlocutors -- from senior military generals to laborers who lost family -- agreed upon was the need for tents to be used as semi-permanent shelter for about 3 to 4 months.  While most stressed winterized units, a minority argued that securing any shelter was more important than waiting for winterized tents.  The latter group added that affected populations were resilient and needed only basic protection from the elements.  The Pakistani military, which was spearheading and directing most relief operations, had yet to establish a long-term reconstruction plan and was primarily focused on getting to and stabilizing the injured.  Logistics Will Win the War ==========================  3.  Much of the civilian leadership of AJK and Muzzafarabad were killed or severely injured.  The military was leading relief efforts but found coordination with the central command in Islamabad and with non-military relief efforts in the city complicated.  In many cases, private citizens were simply hiring trucks to ship goods to Muzzafarabad and then throwing the goods off the trucks while driving through the city.  Survivors heard of ad hoc collection and distribution centers by word-of-mouth; these sites lacked security elements to ensure orderly disbursement.   Many main roads to the city were passable, although cluttered with rocks and debris.  Several points along the road from Murree to Muzzaffarabad were limited to a single lane of traffic. These choke points were barely wide enough for a local "jingle" truck to pass, causing traffic jams and delaying needed relief supplies.  Getting out of the Big City ===========================  4.  Most relief personnel considered the situation in Muzzaffarabad to be stable and were encouraging relief efforts to shift to smaller communities in AJK.  Pakistani military officers considered Chokoti, Jure, Sawan, Dhani and Patika to be priority areas.  Almost a week after the disaster, these areas had yet to receive any assistance.  Comment =======  5. Our team believed that the military, civilian officials, and relief personnel in Muzzafarabad were doing a credible job in attempting to deliver assistance in the face of this overwhelming disaster.  There was a strong recognition and desire to do more both in Muzzafarabad and surrounding areas, limited only by the logistical challenges in transporting relief supplies and personnel.  While coordination could certainly be improved among those providing relief on the ground and with central authorities in Islamabad, we believe that such challenges will diminsh as the military and civilian authorities regain firm control and communications infrastructure recovers.

Butenis, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1. (C)  Summary and introduction:  One week after the October 8 South Asian earthquake, public and private relief operations on the ground are pushing forward.  The Government of Pakistan's (GOP) strategic concept of operations for the relief campaign, however, continues to evolve, with the Army's GHQ now offering its own vision for the relief campaign to supplant the plan unveiled by the Prime Minister's Federal Relief Commission only three days ago. U.S. military and civilian assistance continue to bring relief supplies into Pakistan and then out to affected areas, while members of post's earthquake working group serve as discreet liaisons between the civilian and military sides of the GOP and between the GOP and the UN and NGO relief organizations.  As the crisis moves into its second week, critical issues must be addressed to protect survivors in the affected areas and to ensure that the relief operation has the necessary logistical resources to increase movement of supplies to the far reaches of the quake zone.  Pakistani interlocutors have been effusive in their praise and gratitude for the  U.S. response to this natural disaster; if managed correctly, the USG relief effort will broaden and deepen our relationship with this often-mistrustful ally. End summary and introduction.   AMB Visit to Bagh:  Relief Underway, Next Step is Shelter --------------------------------------------- ------------  2. (SBU)  On October 14, Ambassador Crocker traveled by helicopter to the Azad Kashmir town of Bagh, where he saw relief efforts proceeding in good order.  Under the direction of a Pakistan Army brigadier, military troops had laid out and secured landing zones for relief helos, organized quick off-load of incoming supplies and on-load of wounded evacuees and erected a medical tent staffed by a Korean physician and Spanish rescue team.   The brigadier had only one message for the Ambassador to take back to relief coordinators in Islamabad:  "Send winterized shelter."  The change of seasons is well along in this Himalayan region.  The USAID/DART team and U.S. military are investigating global inventories and manufacturers of winterized tents, as significant numbers of such tents and other pre-fabricated, quick-erect shelters must be imported to Pakistan soonest.   GOP Coordination:  Firm Grip or Still Grasping? --------------------------------------------- --  3. (C)  Post received information late October 14 indicating that the GOP's initial earthquake relief model -- with immediate disaster relief under MG Farooq at the Federal Relief Commission (FRC) and long-term recovery under a new Reconstruction Authority headed by MG Zubair -- has already been recalled.  Brigadier Nasser Janjua, Director General - Military Operations (DGMO) told an ODRP liaison that it was unrealistic to expect an hoc organization like the FRC to conceive, communicate and implement a vision for a crisis of this magnitude.  While Mg Farroq and his staff have been sorting out office space and learning their phone numbers, BG Nasser said, the Pakistani military has imposed order on chaos.  On the morning of October 15, DGMO briefed Vice Chief of Army Staff Hayat on a military concept of operations to supersede that devised by the FRC.  The DGMO plan would base U.S. forces near Islamabad, in support positions for Pakistani assets deployed to forward operating bases (FOBs). The DGMO concept reflects GHQ sensitivities to force protection issues raised by the prospect of U.S. military operations in remote areas known to harbor extremist elements.  BG Nasser urged ODRP to consider GHQ the "central planning cell" for relief operations and requested a copy of the list of available USG assistance that had earlier been passed to the FRC.  (Note:  As of this writing, ODRP and post liaisons are at GHQ for a briefing on the DGMO concept.  If Gen. Hayat (4-star) approves the proposal, FRC Coordinator MG Farooq (2-star) will quickly abandon the FRC concept presented three days ago in favor of the DGMO model.  End note.)  Relief Flights Operations -------------------------  4. (C)  Seven U.S. milair cargo flights arrived in Pakistan on October 14:  four (4) C-130s and one (1) C-17, carrying tents, medical supplies and food (Halal).  A KC-10 carrying relief personnel and a NATO 707 with medical teams and supplies also arrived at Chaklala air field.  Ten U.S. military helicopters completed 65 sorties, transporting 216,000 lbs. of relief supplies and evacuating 557 injured passengers.  The U.S. Contingency Response Group (CRG) supported four (4) Afghan National Army helos on 14 sorties on October 14, transporting 12,000 lbs of supplies and 65 injured passengers.  The State Department-funded NAS Air Wing Helos flew 19 sorties on October 14, carrying 8400 kg of relief supplies and evacuating 88 passengers.  Two U.S. C-130s conducted air drops operations in the Muzzafarabad area on October 15; given the dangers of low-altitude flying in the mountain terrain surrounding many villages, additional planning will be required before operations can begin to drop rations to survivors isolated in these areas.  Incoming Air Assets -------------------  5. (C)  Additional helicopter support is in the pipeline, giving the U.S. military Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) a window to identify alternate air fields for operations.  The first three of an expected twenty-four (24) CH-47s are scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on October 21.  One NAS-funded MI-17 arrived in Pakistan the morning of October 15; a second is expected later the same day.  With the arrival of these helos, the DAC will reach full capacity for the space allotted at the Qasim and Chaklala air fields. ODRP and DAC representatives are working to bring Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and Army coordinators together to expedite the process of selecting alternative venues for helo basing and operations.  Other U.S. Military Assets -------------------------- 6. (C)  Additional U.S. military relief supplies will begin arriving at the port of Karachi on October 17, with the morning arrival of the commercial vessel Northern Lights, followed by the U.S.S, Pearl Harbor later the same afternoon.   The ARCENT 831st Transportation Battalion will receive, off-load and transfer the cargo (relief supplies and heavy earth-moving and engineering equipment) to trains for transport north to the quake zone.  Media Coverage --------------  7. (SBU)  With a live feed from Chaklala air field, CNN broadcasts throughout October 14 were filled with images of U.S. helicopters moving relief supplies north and returning with injured survivors, who were then carried to a PAF field hospital for treatment on the side of the taxi-ways.  During CNN's live interviews with the Ambassador and RDML Lefever, U.S. ground crews could be seen off-loading fixed wing cargo planes from around the world.  State and military public affairs officers have been directing Pakistani and international journalists onto U.S. helos to ensure coverage of the relief campaign and its results.  Before departing Chaklala air field, the Ambassador pressed a senior Pakistani military official to put Pakistani media onto Pakistani military helos, particularly those pushing deep into isolated areas from forward operating bases in Kashmir.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 015531  SIPDIS  KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: AEMR, EAID, MASS, PARM, PGOV, PK, PREL, AID, Earthquake, UN SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  UNHCR PLANS FOR CAMPS AND SHELTER  REF: A. ISLAMABAD 15522 AND NOTAL      B. HUNT/SWAMY/GRENCIK EMAIL TO SA/PB 14-16 OCTOBER         2005  1.   The October 8, 2005 magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Pakistan left an estimated 3.3 million people without shelter (UN Office of Humanitarian Coordinator, October 15).  Providing temporary shelter from them remains a top priority of the international assistance effort and the government of Pakistan.  The United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) and the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) group is focused on establishing small temporary camps only where necessary, putting primary emphasis on providing shelter close to the destroyed homes of survivors.  CAMPS FOR EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS -----------------------------  2.  The UNDAC Camp Management Cluster, led by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), received a written request on October 13, 2005 from Pakistan's Federal Relief Coordinator, Major General Farooq Ahmed Kahn, to establish camps for those left homeless by the earthquake. The UN Flash Appeal for the South Asia Earthquake contains a request for $22 million for the UNDAC Camp Management Cluster to provide everything needed to operate camps for up to 500,000 people except food (which is included in the Food Cluster Request).  UNHCR and the fourteen non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the Camp Management Cluster, recognizing that camps can be magnets for those looking for assistance and become unnecessarily large, have agreed to minimize the number of camps and to aim to keep them open only for six months.  The Camp Management Cluster will work with the Shelter and other UNDAC clusters to achieve this goal.  To keep camp sizes small, it plans to:  -- Prevent interim displacement by delivering tents and blankets to the most remote areas possible to enable people to remain near their destroyed homes;  -- Provide tents, blankets, non-food items, and organizational assistance to spontaneous settlements;  -- Keep those camps it is necessary to establish as small as possible;  -- Work to establish and maintain in the camps Sphere standards (which set minimum levels of assistance for disaster assistance).  UN HAS NO PLANS TO ESTABLISH LARGE CAMPS ----------------------------------------  3.  UNHCR and NGO members of the Camp Management Cluster are currently completing site surveys for the small camps in Muzaffarabad, Balakot and Batagram and in other locations. Although October 14 newspaper reports referred to a Government of Pakistan (GOP) plan to create "tent cities" to house earthquake victims, the UN has received no formal request from the GOP for such camps.  If asked, UNHCR will provide technical advice to GOP on establishing and operating large camps, but it will not itself take a role in management of camps in urban areas or camps located great distances from the homes of survivors.  PROVIDING SHELTER TO THOSE OUTSIDE CAMPS ----------------------------------------  4.  UNHCR is encouraged by assurances from the GOP that those in the earthquake-affected area will want to stay as close to their destroyed dwellings as possible.  It has already provided 2,400 winterized tents to its NGO partners for distribution, and an additional 15,415 winterized tents and 220,000 blankets from UHCR stockpiles in Afghanistan, Turkey and Dubai are scheduled to be delivered by October 20, The Shelter Cluster is also working to provide tents to the displaced who want to remain near their homes.  UNDAC and the Shelter Cluster are in the process of determining how many tents have already been delivered, how many are being shipped, and how many of them are winterized.  The Shelter Cluster reports that estimates of the need for tents varies; initial estimates were that between 100,000 and 200,000 tents would be needed, but the Shelter Cluster now estimates the number required could be as high as 600,000.  As of October 15, 2005, the Shelter Cluster estimated that 15,000 tents had already been delivered and that 66,000 were in the pipeline, but stressed that these are preliminary figures and that it lacks complete information from all donors.  5.  Comment:  The need to shelter survivors of the earthquake is growing more acute each day, as the shift in weather conditions has left thousands exposed to the elements. Post's contacts in the Kashmiri community agree with the GOP assessment that strong cultural imperatives will make survivors extremely reluctant to abandon their land and homes.  The sizable Kashmiri community in Islamabad/Rawalpindi is already housing extended family members affected by the earthquake, but will not be able to absorb the thousands of displaced survivors.  Post will continue to monitor UNHCR and GOP resettlement plans as Pakistan shifts from emergency relief toward sustainable mid-term housing for the homeless. CROCKER

(SBU)  SUMMARY:  On October 15, Foreign Secretary Muhammed Riaz Khan, in a meeting with Ambassador Crocker, explained the GOP,s highest near term priority was obtaining winterized tents and blankets for the three million people needing shelter in the affected areas, and he requested U.S. assistance in locating throughout the world supplies of suitable tents.  The Ambassador assured him the Embassy was acutely aware of the need for tents and blankets, which we had heard at all levels from detachment commanders to President Musharraf, and had already sent back requests for Washington agencies to determine global availability.  Action requested:  Both the U.S. military via CENTCOM and USAID/DART are working this issue.  Washington agencies are requested as an urgent priority to identify from sources around the world supplies of winterized tents that can be provided as part of earthquake assistance to Pakistan.  End summary.  2.  (U)  This is an action request -- see para 7.  3.  (U)  Foreign Secretary On October 15, Ambassador was asked to meet with Foreign Secretary Muhammed Riaz Khan. Khan was accompanied by Tariq Osman Hyder, Additional Secretary for UN Affairs, who is the Foreign Office's  SIPDIS earthquake coordinator.  Khan expressed Pakistan,s gratitude for the support of the United States since the earthquake, specifically referencing the early and substantial pledge of $50 million in assistance, the provision of airwing and helicopter support, the visit by Secretary Rice, and President Bush,s visit to the Pakistani Embassy to sign the condolence book (Khan noted President Bush was the only foreign leader to do so).  All these gestures were deeply appreciated by the GOP and Pakistani people.  4.  (SBU)  Khan said that he wished to convey the GOP,s urgent request for winterized tents and blankets.  The earthquake happened to coincide with the onset of fall weather, and it would soon be getting much colder in the affected areas.  The GOP had located about 100,000 tents, and was asking local manufacturers to make more, but this would accommodate but a small fraction of the 3 million people who would need lodging.  The GOP would be grateful if the U.S. had any tents in storage (particularly in the region like Turkey or Jordan) it could provide.  Ambassador noted the Embassy had put the word out through both DOD and AID channels to obtain a reliable inventory of winterized tents. At present we had provided roughly 3000 winterized tents.  If the GOP was already working with local manufacturers, the U.S. would refrain from tapping that resource but would look to international suppliers.  Khan noted U.N. officials had told him UNHCR had 20,000 tents available in Turkey (which he understood it would take 37 sorties of C-130s to transport to Pakistan).  (Embassy note:  we have subsequently been contacted by NAVEUR about a supply of tents in Turkey, and provided those tents are confirmed to be suitable, we would strongly support the use of NATO strategic lift to bring them to Pakistan.)  5.  (SBU)  Turning to longer term reconstruction, Khan noted the GOJ would soon announce its reconstruction organization. For now, Finance Advisor Salman Shah (along with the Economic Affairs Division, which handles foreign assistance) was working to develop an overall financial estimate of reconstruction costs, while the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority under LTG Zubair was preparing to begin (within a couple of days) an on-the-ground assessment of reconstruction needs.  In time these two organizations would come together, with LTG Zubair having more of the lead on implementation but not playing as big a role on working with international donors.  Coordinating with donors would be key, since the GOP had limited expertise in some of the reconstruction goals (e.g., quake-proof construction codes).  6.  (SBU)  Hyder noted that while Pakistan would be seeking the greatest possible amount of donor assistance, the people of Pakistan "also want to earn our way."  The only way to do that would be through greater trade access to the U.S. and EU, Pakistan,s two largest markets.  Pakistan was urgently requesting the U.S. to consider emergency legislation to lower dutires on textiles, which account for 80 percent of Pakistan,s exports to the United States (Hyder noted virtually all other Pakistani exports enter the U.S. duty free under the GSP program).  Pakistan would also like the U.S. to fast track Pakistan,s request to launch FTA negotiations.  President Musharraf would be writing a letter on these topics soon (and sending a similar letter to the European Union).  Khan remarked that Pakistan understood the U.S. had extended trade benefits to countries affected by the December 2004 tsunami, and asked that in a similar vein the U.S. empower Pakistan to earn the money to pay for its reconstruction.  Hyder said that while most textile production in the affected areas was small-scale handicraft textiles, the migration of working-age Kashmiris out of the affected areas to major manufacturing centers like Karachi and Lahore meant that the health of Pakistan,s industrial sector (of which textiles represents roughly 60 percent of exports) would have a great impact on the flow of reconstruction funds to the affected areas.  7.  (SBU)  Action requested:  following up on Khan,s request for U.S. assistance in locating winterized tents -- a priority which has been emphasized at every level from division commanders to President Musharraf -- Washington agencies are requested as an urgent priority to identify worldwide supplies/sources of winterized tents that can be provided to those left homeless by the earthquake.

From October 13 to 15, the USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) conducted an assessment in Muzaffarabad.  The USAID/DART,s assessments confirmed that winterized tents are the priority in earthquake affected areas.  The health cluster estimates that 67,000 persons are in need of immediate medical attention, and 13,000 people have been evacuated as of October 15.  Participants at the October 15, U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) meeting reported that there is a need for additional field hospitals in more remote areas of Pakistani Kashmir, as well as women health care providers.  Operational hospitals lack adequate water supply, and some water treatment units are needed for these facilities and communities.  End summary.  ------------------------------------------- USAID/DART Assessment Trip to Muzaffarabad -------------------------------------------  2.  From October 13 to 15, three members of the USAID/DART and a U.S. Embassy representative traveled to Muzaffarabad to conduct assessments.  The USAID/DART met with the UNDAC team leader, and stated that as of October 13, the local government had called off all search and rescue operations in Muzaffarabad, and all search and rescue teams were being sent home.  The UNDAC leader noted that cooperation between the U.N. and the military has been excellent in Muzaffarabad. UNDAC is in the process of starting coordination meetings, and is currently trying to determine which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are operating in Muzaffarabad.  The UNDAC leader noted that there is a lack of coordination with local NGOs.  3.  According to the USAID/DART, the German government has two helicopters in Muzaffarabad and on October 14, one helicopter traveled north to Neelum, and the other helicopter traveled south to Jhelum.  On October 14, the German helicopters evacuated 171 Level One trauma victims.  4.  The USAID/DART reported that in Muzaffarabad, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will take the lead in shelter, the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) in health, and the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) in food.  5.  On October 14, the USAID/DART was told by an Indian Kashimiri who left Indian Kashmir after the earthquake that a 600-person camp was set up on the road to the airport in Muzaffarabad.  The USAID/DART was told that of the 600 camp residents, 50 to 60 people are in tents and the rest are sleeping on the ground.  Throughout the team,s assessment trip in Muzaffarabad, members were repeatedly told by local residents and government officials that tents were the number one priority.  On October 16, three USAID airlifts of relief commodities carrying a total of 1,570 tents are scheduled to arrive in Pakistan. (Note: The USAID/DART is working on a comprehensive shelter strategy.  End Note.)  6.  The team reported that the airport at Muzaffarabad receives four to five C-130 airdrops of food, medical supplies, blankets, and water per day.  However, no tents are being delivered.  The airdropped items are then airlifted to affected villages by helicopters or provided to villages on the road to the airport.  7.  The Federal Minister for Communications for Pakistani Kashmir visited the USAID/DART and stated that local officials are having problems accessing affected villages. The USAID/DART reported that the Minister,s priorities are tents (assuming 5 persons per family), blankets, and bulldozers or earth moving equipment to dispose of the debris from collapsed houses.  8.  The USAID/DART Health Officer (HO) reported that a 100-bed hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and located in the new stadium will be operational on October 18.  The hospital will have a heavy surgical capacity, as well as primary care, OB/GYN, and pediatric services.  The hospital will have 2 surgeons, 2 anesthesiologists, and 40 professional personnel, including doctors and nurses.  9.  The USAID/DART HO visited the Pakistani Air Force Hospital at the airport in Muzaffarabad.  The hospital opened on October 11 and staff saw 174 patients on that day.  Since October 11, hospital staff members have seen between 300 and 350 patients per day.  Most of the patients do not stay in the hospital and return to their homes or camps.  There are very few inpatients.  The hospital has x-ray capability, OB/GYN and labor and delivery services, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and medical doctors.  The USAID/DART HO spoke with a doctor at the hospital who told him that tents are the priority.  10.  Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-Belgium) conducted an assessment by road during the week of October 10 and observed that tents are a priority.  Jackets and winter coats are also needed since residents will use them to protect themselves from the cold weather and also as minimal shelter.  11.  The USAID/DART HO helicoptered up to the Jhelum Valley to deliver emergencyrelief supplies.  The road along Jhelum is blocked in multiple places, and only one bridge across the Jhelum River is intact.  The USAID/DART HO visited a village where 20 houses were all heavily damaged or completely flattened.  The unloading of relief supplies at this village was orderly; however, residents rushed the helicopter with injured people, and the situation became violent as residents fought each other to ensure that their injured relatives could be evacuated.  ---------------------------- USAID/DART Trip to Mansehra ---------------------------  12.  On October 14, the USAID/DART Structural Specialist traveled to Mansehra on an assessment trip with the U.S. military and U.S. Embassy representatives.  The team scouted forward operation bases and conducted infrastructure assessments.  The USAID/DART Structural Specialist reported that Mansehra sustained minimal damage from the earthquake and primarily mud houses on the hills were damaged.  Roads in Mansehra are in good condition and are not blocked by debris.  The USAID/DART Structural Specialist noted that the bridges in Mansehra were all passable.  --------------- Security ---------------  13.  The U.N. reported on October 15 that the roads from Balakot to Hajipur are now open.  A field hospital that was being transported from Muzaffarabad to Chakoti became stuck at Gahri Dupatta due to landslides blocking the road in both directions.  As of October 14, the Pakistani military is deployed on all major roads, and there were no further reports of looting.  --------- Shelter ---------  14.  Participants at the UNDAC team meetings determined that providing shelter for residents affected by the earthquake before winter arrives is the top priority.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) requested that U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) take the lead in the camp management cluster.  As of October 14, UNHCR distributed 2,400 winterized tents, and in the next week several flights will arrive with plastic sheeting and other emergency relief supplies.  On October 13, Pakistan,s Federal Relief Coordinator requested that the U.N. Resident Coordinator (UN RC) establish camps for residents displaced by the earthquake.  The GOP will be responsible for assisting UNHCR identify locations for the camps, logistics, and security. UNHCR will provide all other camp functions, except food which will be provided by the U.N. food cluster.  On October 16, UNHCR, accompanied by NGO representatives and 150 tents, will fly to Muzaffarabad for a site survey.  UNHCR is also assessing Balakot and Batagram. UNHCR plans small cluster arrangements versus large tent cities.  15.  The U.N. remains concerned that the internally displaced person (IDP) camps do not become a quote pull end quote factor attracting large numbers of victims who may be better housed in smaller, spontaneous settlements or elsewhere.  The U.N. will make a decision soon on sites for other camps as well as sites for five warehouses for general use.  Relief organizations will be able to temporarily store relief supplies in these warehouses before shipping them to beneficiaries.  As of October 14, 15,000 tents are available in-country, and 67,000 tents are in the pipeline.  Joint shelter assessments will take place starting on October 17. The current gaps in the shelter cluster are mainly procurement shortages; however, solutions, such as supporting local providers to increase the production of tents, are being suggested.  16.  The Red Cross has 22,000 tents in their pipeline and is setting up production lines.  Donors are urged to bring in more tents.  UNHCR stated that it is urgent to provide assistance to remote areas in order to avoid mass displacement of people.  Helicopter assets are expected to at least double in the next week.  ---------- Food -----------  17.  At the October 14 food cluster meeting, participants stated that the distribution of high energy biscuits (HEB) to earthquake affected persons is continuing in the areas of Mansehra and Muzaffarabad.  As of October 14, 30 tons of HEBs have been distributed in Muzaffarabad and 20 tons in Mansehra.  NGOs reported that food and relief supplies are being distributed by individuals and communities, and the local procurement of food commodities is progressing.  NGOs are concerned that relief supplies are focused in areas such as Muzaffarabad, and many remote villages are not being reached.  At present, there is insufficient information available on the nutritional situation of earthquake victims.   --------------------- Water and Sanitation ---------------------  18.  According to the U.N., there is an urgent need for latrines, and sanitary conditions are reportedly poor in all IDP sites.  Operational hospitals lack adequate water supply, and some water treatment units need to be provided to these facilities as well as communities.  --------------- Health ---------------  19.  The health cluster estimates that 67,000 persons are in need of immediate medical attention, and 13,000 persons have been evacuated as of October 15.  The hospitals in Islamabad are filled to capacity.  Punjab Province has cleared 3,000 to 5,000 beds for patients to be transferred from Islamabad. WHO reported 8 cases of bloody diarrhea on October 14 and 80 cases on October 15.  Participants at the October 15 UNDAC meeting reported that there is a need for additional field hospitals in more remote areas of Pakistani Kashmir as well women health care providers.  CROCKER 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 015677  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL -- PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PREL, PK, MASS, AEMR, PREF, ASEC, PGOV EAID, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: ONLY MINOR MISSTEPS IN MILITARY RESPONSE  REF: ISLAMABAD 15559 AND NOTAL  1.  (U)  In the days since a violent 7.6 earthquake rocked northern Pakistan at 0853 October 8th, the Pakistan military has responded to the national crisis with valor and dedication.  Army helicopters were in the air less than two hours after the quake struck, flying reconnaissance missions over the North West Frontier Province and the Pakistan side of Kashmir. Before noon that same morning, Pak helicopter crews were flying the casualties back to Islamabad, bringing with them first accounts of the widespread devastation suffered in this mountainous area.  Since that day, the Pakistani military has personified patriotism and professionalism, demonstrating precisely why the military is the most highly-respected national institution in this country.  2.  (U)  Despite their own casualties and losses, military units -- from GHQ commanders to the lowest jawan -- have worked unceasingly over the past ten days executing rescue and relief missions in the most challenging conditions, organizing a massive air lift of humanitarian relief supplies into Pakistan and pushing those supplies north by helicopter sorties and truck convoys.  There has been no indication that any military unit has shirked its duty during this national crisis.  Indeed, post has heard Pakistanis proudly cite the dedication of those who have soldiered on, regardless of their personal losses, such as the brigadier organizing rescue and relief operations in near Balakot even as his own family lay buried beneath the rubble.  3.  (SBU)  Although the military quickly shifted into response mode after the earthquake, it took the Government of Pakistan (GOP) a full 24 hours to begin to comprehend the scope of this natural disaster, and another 48 hours to establish the relief infrastructure necessary to coordinate relief operations.  (Note:  Looking back at the recent U.S. experience with Hurricane Katrina, it is not surprising that the GOP lost precious days struggling to grasp the parameters of this unprecedented calamity.  One high-ranking politician confided to emboff, "We didn't have a FEMA, so we had to start from scratch."  End note.)  While the newly-created Federal Relief Commission (FRC) set up an office in the Prime Minister's Secretariat and began hammering out a concept of operations, the Army and Pakistani Air Force (PAF) conducted organized, coordinated and professional relief missions 24/7.  Army helos carried supplies to hastily-established forward-operating bases in Muzzafarabad and Mansehra, flying into narrow valleys to survey areas inaccessible by road. the danger was underscored by the loss of an MI-17 and its crew on October 13th when a change in weather trapped it in a valley. PAF C-130s began air drops of relief supplies within the first few days of operations.  The military has deployed every resource at its disposal -- from sophisticated air assets to mule trains -- to get help to those who need it. In many leveled towns, civil administration vanished as the physical infrastructure collapsed, with thousands of public officials and service providers among the quake victims. The army worked to fill that void, imposing order on chaos.  4.  (SBU)  Troops (11th Corps) garrisoned in the region immediately began relief operations in the NWFP, even though their units lost suffered close to 1300 casualties, with more than 450 killed.  (Note:  Many troops would have not only lost comrades, but also family members living near the garrisons.  End note.)  Despite the new mission that nature involuntarily thrust upon it, the Army has capably responded to these new demands without compromising on-going security operations in the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas to the west of the quake zone.  Instead, the 10th Corps has reinforced its brother unit with troops and supply lines from the Punjab.  In effect, since the earthquake, the entire Pakistani military (the 11th Corps in particular) has been waging the equivalent of a two-front war -- and, in post's view, doing so with distinction.  5.  (SBU)  Of course, there have been missteps and the occasional institutional friction along the way, as the nascent FRC has bumped against the near omnipotent GHQ.  Even with these growing pains, the military has effectively (if not always seamlessly) managed a relief system that has moved more than a half milllion pounds of humanitarian assistance, along with rescue teams, medical personnel and crisis managers, into some of the most unforgiving terrain imaginable.  Ten days into the crisis, the trends continue to be encouraging. GHQ acknowledges the FRC's leadership role, telling emboffs that the FRC "speaks for the GOP." Coordination between military and civilian agencies improves daily.  6.  (SBU)  The best evidence of Pakistani military professionalism has been the grace with which U.S. military assistance has been accepted and welcomed.  Confident that our assurances that U.S. forces are to support the Pakistani relief mission are sincere, both the Army and PAF have shown an increasing level of transparency and openness in coordinating with U.S. military interlocutors.  Simply put, our uniforms speak the same language as their uniforms; together, they have made things happen.  Two weeks ago, post's military liaisons were haggling to secure access for Embassy motorcades at the Chaklala air field; today, at that same air field, NAVCENT's 209-person Disaster Assistance Center is running independent flight operations for 400 fixed-wing and helo sorties and managing a logistical operation pushing tons of relief supplies to the disaster area.  7. (SBU)  It cannot have been easy for the proud Pakistani military to admit that it needed help to respond to the needs of its citizens; that it has done so demonstrates that its commitment to duty trumps institutional vanity.  By according the Pakistan military the respect it deserves for its competent and comprehensive emergency response, the U.S. makes it easier for military leaders to be receptive to our guidance and suggestions for improving coordination and efficiency.  In the end, we must always remember that this is Pakistan's crisis; as a FRC contact told emboffs on October 18, "As much as we appreciate the U.S. effort, it is up to our internal organizational abilities to bring relief to our nation."

C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 015728  SIPDIS  FROM THE AMBASSADOR KABUL PLEASE PASS CFC-A  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/2015 TAGS: EAID, PK, PREL, SENV, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  NEXT STEPS   Classified By: AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER.  REASONS: 1.4(B)(D).   1.  (C) Eleven days into Pakistan's earthquake disaster, substantial U.S. assistance continue to encourage the Pakistani public and give confidence to the government that it has strong international backing as it confronts the worst catastrophe in its history.  Over the next several days, a U.S. military engineering company and field hospital will deploy into the affected area, strengthening the sense of an ongoing, reliable relief effort.  The Pakistani government, led by the military, has responded well to this crisis, demonstrating an impressive organizational ability, both in Islamabad and in the quake area.  2.  (C) That is the good news.  The reality is that the magnitude of the damage and the inhospitable terrain in which the quake occurred will mean that Pakistan and the international community must stay focused on the relief effort for the weeks and even months ahead.  The human losses are almost unbelievable with the government now estimating more than 60,000 dead and many more than that injured.  The remote, isolated locations of many of the villages compound the difficulty of delivering effective relief, and we are only a few weeks away from the onset of winter in a mountainous area where several hundred thousand are without shelter.  Some in the international community--and in Pakistan--are already talking about a shift from relief to reconstruction.  If we start backing away from relief operations, a lot more people are going to die.  3.  (C) As I judge it from here, the overall international response has been less than impressive.  The United Nations was slow to engage on this crisis, and its response remains lackluster.  As of today, for example, only four U.N. helicopters are operating in country.  The UNSYG is basically missing in action.  He has not visited Pakistan, nor has he done much to signal that earthquake relief is a top U.N. priority.  From our contacts here, I sense that other donors are looking at what the U.N. is doing and deciding on that basis that there is no need to be overly generous.  4.  (C) Against this backdrop, I am concerned that the Geneva Donors Conference on October 26 will not be a success.  The Europeans in particular are lagging, and the press here is speculating that grants from the European Union collectively or its members bilaterally may reflect simply a reprogramming of existing aid commitments.  5.  (C) To sustain the momentum that we and the Pakistani government are developing, and to prevent this devastated region from sliding into a fresh disaster, I recommend three steps:  -- a call to Kofi Annan to spark a more energetic U.N. effort.  In particular, Annan should visit Pakistan immediately and/or personally chair the Geneva Conference.  -- a call to Jack Straw, both as our leading European ally and because of the UK's EU presidency to assess the extent of European commitments and to urge more robust pledges.  -- a decision now by Washington to commit $150 million in new funds to the relief and reconstruction effort.  6.  (C) It is hard to overstate the magnitude of this disaster and its potential impact.  We have gotten off to a very good start, but it is only a start.  What we do and what we are able to get others to do in the coming days will be critical to determining what happens to hundreds of thousands of people, the way in which the government of Pakistan and its supporters are perceived by the people of this country and for the image of the U.S. and the West in the Muslim world.

The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that there are 100,000 to 250,000 people who are not receiving relief in remote areas.  UNICEF will be assessing these un-accessed areas.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) requested that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) establish camps at sites in Balakot, Batagram, Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Shangla, and Gari Habibullah.  The shelter cluster group reported that 2 million people need shelter.  The Pakistani military plans to establish camps in Balakot, Gari Habibullah, and Batagram within the next 24 hours.  End summary.  -------------------- Logistics --------------------  2.  On October 18, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended the Logistics cluster group meeting and reported that the lack of information regarding needs of earthquake affected residents as well as the specific areas affected is still the major problem.  The group reported that it is difficult to determine what relief supplies are in the pipeline.  3.  One group participant estimated that on the civilian side of the airport, there are 300 metric tons or 120 pallets still on the ground.  In response to increasing traffic, the GOP has just announced that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have six hours to clear cargo after it arrives.  Cargo that is not moved during that time will be picked up by the Pakistani military, presumably for distribution.  --------------------- Water and Sanitation ---------------------  4.  On October 18, a USAID/Pakistan representative attended a water and sanitation cluster group meeting and reported that UNICEF has set up a team to assess un-accessed areas. UNICEF estimates that there are 100,000 to 250,000 people who are not receiving relief in remote areas.  The UNICEF team will conduct a rapid assessment of these villages. Meeting participants reported that there is no additional need for mobile treatment units in Muzaffarabad.  5.  UNICEF and the Ministry of Environment (MOE) are collaborating to provide safe and clean drinking water in affected areas.  The MOE has constituted a survey team that has already surveyed Muzaffarabad and is currently surveying Balakot in order to assess the feasibility of installing water purification plants.  The survey team will identify the water source, quality, and the capacity of the treatment plant in terms of the treated water output.  The MOE has ordered four plants, one of which will be installed in Muzaffarabad on October 19.  ---------------------- Camp Management ----------------------  6.  On October 18, UNHCR briefed the diplomatic community on its efforts as leader of the camp management cluster for the relief effort.  UNHCR reported that it needs funding for the camp management category of the U.N.'s 2005 South Asia Earthquake appeal in the amount of $22 million.  The food cluster appeal contains funding for food for those in the camps, but the camp management appeal includes funding for all other elements needed to establish camps logistics, water and sanitation, health, shelter, and emergency relief supplies such as kitchen sets and blankets.  UNHCR has already spent USD 7,584,000 from its operational reserve, which must be replenished.  7.  UNHCR reported the following main points:  --UNHCR's main goal is to discourage additional displacement by providing technical and organizational assistance to informal settlements and tents and emergency relief supplies to individual families who want to remain near their homes;  --The GOP requested that UNHCR establish camps at sites in Balakot, Batagram, Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Shangla, and Gari Habibullah;  --UNHCR will plan camps of 5,000 persons except in Muzaffarabad where there is limited space.  UNHCR will not erect tents until people request to stay in the camp.  UNHCR will not object if those in the camp decide to leave and take their tents nearer to their homes;  --UNHCR has already distributed 3,000 winterized tents and 2,000 kerosene stoves.  UNHCR has an additional 10,000 tents, 20,000 blankets, and other emergency relief items on the way;  --UNHCR plans for the camps to remain open only six months; after this period, UNHCR anticipates that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) or another agency will assume management of any camps that may still be necessary;  --Camp size will be limited to 5,000 persons because of the difficult terrain, and UNHCR will rely on the GOP to identify appropriate locations for camps;  --UNHCR has no plans to establish camps in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, or other urban areas; however, UNHCR will provide technical assistance to the GOP if it decides to construct urban camps.  ------------------ Shelter ------------------  8.  On October 18, the USAID/DART Structural Specialist and the U.S. Military Officer Liaison to the USAID/DART attended the shelter cluster meeting and reported that 300,000 tents are necessary.  The cluster group reported that some residents who live in higher altitude areas are trying to relocate to camp cities in lower areas as they fear landslides and snowfall.  Blankets and tents are the most critically needed items.  The shelter cluster reported that 2 million residents need shelter, and 500,000 people may need to move to camps.  The Pakistani military plans to establish camps in Balakot, Gari Habibullah, and Batagram within the next 24 hours.  UNHCR reported that they will be operating here on a temporary basis for six to seven months.  --------------------------- USAID/DART Assessment Trips ---------------------------  9.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 015731  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/19/2015 TAGS: PK, PREL, PGOV, IN, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: AN OPEN DOOR TO KASHMIR?   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, B    1. (C) Summary:  During an October 18 press conference, President Musharraf sent out a trial balloon on Kashmir, announcing that Pakistan would allow Kashmiri civilians--including Kashmiri politicians--from across the LOC to come to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) to meet relatives and assist in reconstruction work. Musharraf also proposed opening mobile and landline communication links between Kashmiris on either side of the border, a move that was matched by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a few hours later. Musharraf's announcement supporting the free movement of Kashmiris across the border apparently had not been coordinated with the GOP Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Indian counterparts. Musharraf told the press that the idea was a "suggestion" from Pakistan, and that the modalities would have to be worked out. Reaction on both sides of the border appeared positive, leaving open now only the question of when and how. End Summary.  A NEW MUSHARRAF PROPOSAL ON KASHMIR ----------------------------------- 2. (U) During a press conference in Muzaffarabad, President Musharraf unveiled a new plan to allow Kashmiris from across the Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC) to enter AJK to "help their brothers in reconstruction work on this side." While categorical that the proposal was only for civilians, Musharraf said he was open to the idea of allowing political leaders from the two sides to meet and interact on reconstruction issues. He also suggested the opening of landline and mobile phone links between Kashmiris on either side of the border, something which has been unavailable for several years.  3. (C) Musharraf described his announcement as a "suggestion" and said that the modalities would have to be worked out formally by both sides. A call to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Director for Kashmir Affairs Miriam Aftab today confirmed that it was an idea developed by Musharraf (or his close aides) and not by the MFA. (Comment:  If left to the MFA, there would be no creative thinking on this or any other aspect of the Kashmir issue.  End note.)  Aftab candidly admitted that she had been cut out of the loop and was unable to answer questions on how or when Musharraf's proposals would be implemented, whether dialogue with the Indian side had begun, or who the key players in the process were.  PAKISTANI AND INDIAN REACTION ----------------------------- 4. (C) Musharraf's announcement received front-page coverage in this morning's Urdu and English language dailies, which continue to be otherwise consumed by earthquake-related news. Newspaper articles covering Musharraf's proposal were upbeat and positive in most Pakistani newspapers; editorial comment will take another day to emerge. Thus far, opposition parties--including the MMA--have remained quiet on the proposal. Militant groups, including the Islamabad-based United Jihad Council, welcomed the move, saying it would strengthen the cause of Kashmiris.  5. (C) Press reports indicate that the Indian Government reacted warmly to Musharraf's proposals, portraying them as well in line with what India has long advocated--greater movement across the LOC. India's External Ministry Spokesman Natvej Sarna and former Indian Ambassador to Islamabad G. Parthasarthy were quoted in the Indian Express and Reuters saying that India welcomed the remarks, and that they "vindicated India's advocacy of the need for a soft border." Sarna said he is waiting for word from Pakistan to work out the "practical details" of implementing Musharraf's proposal. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh immediately acted on Musharraf's call for better communication links, ordering the Department of telecommunications to set up four Telecom Facilitation Centers (one each in Srinagar, Jamu, Uri, and Tangdhar). The Indian telecommunications centers are supposed to be operational for two weeks, starting today. Kashmiri groups--including the main separatist alliance in Indian Kashmir--the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) said they welcomed the offer. COMMENT ------- 6. (C) Musharraf's proposal is a well-timed attempt to turn public opinion in Kashmir to his side. Given the beating the GOP has taken for reacting too slowly to the crisis and several media accounts of militant groups being first on the ground, Musharraf's suggestion to reunite divided families and allow freer movement of relief personnel across the LOC is a welcome step. Consistent with Musharraf's usual style, he announced first and has left it to the bureaucrats to work out later. What happens to the proposal sticks remains to be seen; the Pakistani bureaucracy will only move on the proposal if consistent pressure is applied from the top. CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 015736  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/18/2015 TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, EAID, MASS, PGOV, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: PUBLIC REACTION TOUR D'HORIZON  REF: ISLAMABAD 15463  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1. (SBU) Summary:  Public criticism of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) relief operations continues.  Media images of angry survivors still waiting for adequate relief, coupled with often-inaccurate and inflamatory editorials are fueling this resentment. Opposition parties have seized on this criticism to demand a full debate in the National Assembly in an effort to discredit the GOP.  Private individuals, companies, political parties and non-governmental organizations have initiated charitable drives, establishing collection points nationwide.  Some of these efforts are being channeled into GOP relief operations, while in other cases direct delivery to victims is being undertaken. Efforts by radical clerics to argue against acceptance of relief supplies from non-Muslim countries has failed, and public opinion seems very much in favor of taking aid from any donor, including Israel and India.  End Summary.  Islamabad/Rawalpindi --------------------  2. (SBU)  With numerous Kashmiri families living and working in Islamabad, nearly everyone knows someone affected by this natural disaster.  Collection and donation points have been established by government entities, private businesses, political parties, and NGOs.  Banners and advertisements exhort residents to contribute generously, and many are doing so.  Prominent politicians and businessmen have used the opportunity to publicize their generosity.  Many of the donations collected are funneled to GOP-relief efforts, although in some cases private individuals, charities, and political parties are attempting to transport donations by road to Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) with decidedly mixed results.  Public criticism of the government-relief efforts remain vocal and widespread.  Anger remains over the collapse of the Margalla Tower apartments, the substandard construction of which appears to be the result of local government corruption.  Media continues to criticize the speed and coordination of the GOP's response; there are daily stories from areas that have yet to recieve sufficient help. Opposition parties are attacking the GOP relief effort.  A National Assembly open debate on October 14 degenerated into a shouting match with opposition politicians denouncing the GOP as incompetent.  The opposition has requested a full parliamentary debate on relief efforts.  Foreign donor aid has been uniformly welcomed and the magnitude of the response (which is visibly apparent at the international airport) has won praise from even normally critical audiences.  Indeed, initial Islamist objections to aid from non-Muslim countries, particularly Israel and India, were quickly silenced as public opinion seemed firmly in the other direction.  Kashmir and NWFP ----------------  4. (SBU) Post has reports from Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir (AJK) that the GOP response has not been well-received.  Unrealistically high expectations of the army's ability to deliver relief supplies coupled with severe logistical challenges and deteriorating weather conditions have created a well-spring of resentment.  Reports of attacks on aid convoys and distribution centers by villagers continue to filter back from the area, indicating a continuing sense of desperation.  While the GOP's growing focus on reconstruction may overcome this initial anger, for the moment AJK appears to feel largely neglected by the center. This perception endures despite international relief worker assessments that relief efforts (both GOP and private) are being distributed equitably among the affected areas based on need and accessibility.  5. (SBU) In the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), business remains entirely focused on earthquake relief.  Charity drives are on the upswing, as people grasp the enormity of the damage to northeastern districts that now face a very difficult winter.  The relief effort continues to be hampered by a lack of overarching authority.  The Islamist Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) government has been on the move throughout the hardest hit areas to coordinate the relief efforts with federal and Army units.  Within the MMA, officials are sniping at each other over the first-time attendance of Chief Minister Durrani at the October 12 National Security Council meeting.  JI officials are saying "once, but never again," while JUI-F leaders argue such attendance is necessary to mount a more effective relief response.  In the Provincial Assembly, parties passed a unanimous resolution on October 17, calling for a specific earmark of international relief funds for NWFP.  This reflects a deeply-rooted distrust in national decision-making that the assembly feels will short change the province.  The English-language provincial press remains critical of the Army for an insufficient initial response, its refusal of Indian helicopter support, and its failure to divert more defense resources to the crisis.  The Urdu-language provincial press has, in contrast, been uniformly complimentary of army efforts in the province. Punjab ------  6. (SBU) In Punjab, provincial and local efforts to collect and funnel relief efforts north are prominent and ongoing. While opposition parties remained relatively quiet during the first week following the earthquake, they have now begun to break their silence.  Opposition members explained that they had refrained from criticizing the government relief efforts in order to present a unified front, as well as to avoid the appearance of taking political advantage of the crisis.  The initial grace period has now come to an end and they will raise their complaints at the October 20 provincial assembly session.  Both opposition politicians and PML members have begun to criticize the lack of information and transparency in the collection and distribution of relief goods and donations.  They additionally criticized a perceived lack of concern from both federal and provincial leaders.  The continued absence of the Chief Minister is cited as the prime example.  Instead of being in the affected areas with the people, the leadership remains in Islamabad or, in the case of the Chief Minister, hosting fundraisers in Washington, DC.  One PML member noted that although Nawaz Sharif had major faults, during the flood in Punjab he was seen distributing goods to to the victims. She stated "This is not a people's government and it comes across at a time like this."  Karachi -------  7. (SBU) Karachi is taken with the call to help fellow Pakistanis in the earthquake zone.  Collection sites for relief goods have sprung up at schools, on military bases, near mosques and bus stations.  Karachi university students and others have lined up to give blood and appeals for monetary donations are plastered on bill boards and the sides of buildings.  Large amounts of money have reached NGO's such as the well respected Edhi Foundation.  Pakistan Navy Karachi Commander Vice Admiral Muhammad Asad Qureshi stated that each of Pakistan's armed services stationed in Karachi have "adopted" a zone in the earthquake effected area and plan to focus their individual attention in those particular areas. (Note:  It is unclear if this is an organized effort.  End note.)  All major local press was dock-side for the October 18 arrival of the USS Pearl Harbor and off-loading of its humanitarian relief cargo, providing favorable coverage of this USG assistance.  In courtesy calls with the Pakistan Navy's District Commander, the Fleet Commander and the Karachi Port Trust, Pakistani hosts thanked the United States for assisting relief operations, saying that they would facilitate future port calls to the maximum extent possible. This warmth seems to be shared by many here in Karachi.  In full dress whites, our visiting US Navy officials received waves and smiles as they passed in a Pakistan Navy motorcade from call to call.  At one traffic intersection a group of covered women leaned out of the back of a taxi-bus to smile and wave.  Pakistani men on the side of the road nodded their heads in agreement.  Balochistan -----------  8. (SBU) In contrast to other parts of the country, sources in Balochistan report that business continues as usual in much of the province.  Collection points appear active only in Quetta and Pashtun areas in the north.  Baloch-audience papers reportedly returned to their normal news coverage at the end of last week.  According to one Baloch tribal leader, most Baloch view AJK and NWFP as totally outside their area of interest.  While tribal loyalty among Pashtuns compel sympathy with their NWFP compatriots, there is no prevailing sense of national tragedy in Baloch areas.  If anything, a certain amount of resentment prevails that a similarly massive national and international relief operation did not materialize when massive floods devestated parts of Balochistan earlier in the year.  9. (C) Comment:  One-week after the earthquake, resentment over what the public views as slow and uncoordinated GOP relief operations continues to build.  President Musharraf remains above-the-fray, leaving the military and the Federal Relief Commission in the Prime Minister's Office (the designated execution coordination points for relief efforts) to bear the brunt of the criticism.  While the opposition hopes to use public anger over the GOP response to discredit the President, neither the childish name-calling at the October 14 National Assembly debate or its refusal to attend an October 18 FRC briefing held at the PM's Secretariat helped the opposition's cause.  The media is asking increasingly uncomfortable questions about the state's historic failures on disaster preparedness and tolerance of shoddy construction projects.  Those in the affected-areas remain skeptical of GOP-assistance, largely a factor of their current desperation and beyond the GOP's control.  We believe that as the situation stabilizes and reconstruction begins, the GOP retains the opportunity to rebuild its image with these parts of the population.  End Comment. CROCKER

The Government of Pakistan (GOP) estimates that the earthquake killed 41,121 people and injured 67,634 others, and these numbers are likely to increase.  The USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) reports that the GOP has made a credible effort to respond to the earthquake given the difficult circumstances, and relief activities are moving at a much faster pace than the USAID/DART has observed during other disasters.  Too many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are operating in easy to reach places, and humanitarian agencies involved in the response are concerned that too much humanitarian assistance will be provided in these areas, while the more remote areas will continue to be neglected.  The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) reports that water purification plants, chlorine tablets and/or water treatment sachets, tents, blankets, and mobile operation theaters are the most urgent health needs.  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that between 300,000 and 600,000 winterized tents are necessary.  To date, approximately 20,000 tents from the international community have been distributed, and 130,000 tents are in the pipeline.  The GOP reports that 100,000 tents have been distributed, and 150,000 tents are in the GOP pipeline, but this has not been confirmed.  End summary.  ------------ Health ------------  2.  On October 16, the USAID/DART Health Officer (HO) attended the health cluster meeting.  The USAID/DART HO reported that the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is setting up a 200-bed hospital and equipment in Abbottabad and has excess surgical equipment.  IOM reported that there is an urgent need for paramedics, doctors, and volunteers in Muzaffarabad.  Meeting participants expressed concern about reports from Mansehra indicating that blood is being transfused without adequate screening.  3.  The Pakistani military has established a 100 to 200-bed triage hospital at Chaklala airbase to admit patients directly on arrival.  The Pakistani Ministry of Health (MOH) will decide where to send the patients after treatment.  4.  The GOP will be opening up 10,000 hospital beds throughout the country within the next few days.  The MOH reported that at least 50,000 people are in need of hospital care and have not yet received any medical care. The Pakistani military plans to send a field hospital to the Neelum Valley.  5.  According to WHO, the lack of basic necessities such as food, water, blankets, and tents is also affecting health workers in the field.  The previously existing health system no longer exists as many health facilities have been destroyed or damaged, and health staff are either highly traumatized, injured, dead or taking care of their own family members.  6.  WHO reported that medical and surgical teams are treating thousands of patients per day, and patients are now arriving with infected open fractures and gangrene.  WHO expects that the lack of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities for the affected population could soon create a major health threat if sufficient quantities of drinking water are not provided.  WHO reported that the major risks are diarrheal and pulmonary diseases and the non-treatment of injuries of earthquake victims.  7.  On October 17, the health cluster reported that urgent surgical requirements include both surgical supplies and anti-tetanus globulin.  Additional referral sites are being established in Sindh and Punjab.  WHO reported that the urgent health needs are water purification plants, chlorine tablets and/or water treatment sachets, tents, blankets, and mobile operation theaters.  --------------------- Water and Sanitation ---------------------  8.  On October 17, the U.N. Liaison Officer (LO) attended the water and sanitation meeting and reported that while the situation is reportedly improving, it is still serious.  It has been estimated that less than 20 percent of the critical water and sanitation needs have been met.  The water and sanitation cluster reported that there are more than two million people lacking sanitation facilities.  The priorities are to obtain adequate and safe drinking water, sanitary disposal of excreta, and ensure basic hygiene.  ------------- Food -------------  9.  Food distributions have started in Muzaffarabad.  The food cluster reports that 67,400 people in 29 villages in the Muzaffarabad area have been supplied with high energy biscuits from 19 distribution points.  A second round of distributions will start shortly.  The food cluster reports that 100 metric tons (MT) have been delivered to the Muzaffarabad area as of October 16.  10.  On October 17, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended the food and nutrition cluster meeting.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) reported that a revised flash appeal will be announced on October 24.  WFP is still attempting to assess areas that were affected by the earthquake.  WFP will conduct an aerial reconnaissance in the next two days to determine which roads were damaged and what areas are accessible.  WFP will also try to assess the migration patterns of people.  From the current migration patterns, there is already an assumption that there will be two outcomes regarding food distributions:  large camps for people where food will be needed and food will have to be transported to inaccessible and remote areas.  11.  WFP is examining transporting food from Muzaffarabad to more remote areas for distribution.  WFP is also trying to determine the following:  the amount of food in country, what additional food is coming into the country, percentage of affected areas needing food, and how much food is required to assist affected areas.  WFP's goal is to assist the one million most vulnerable people.  Currently, the ration requirements are: 450 grams of wheat flour, 70 grams of vegetable oil, 5 grams of iodized salt, 200 grams of high energy biscuits, and 80 grams of dates.  --------------- Shelter ---------------  12.  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) continues to report that tents are the top priority, and IOM reported that the immediate need for shelter is becoming more critical as survivors continue to live outdoors in the rain and the cold nine days after the earthquake.  At the October 17 shelter meeting, IOM provided tentative figures and estimated that between 300,000 and 600,000 winterized tents or non-tent shelters would be required.  To date, approximately 20,000 tents from the international community have been distributed, and 130,000 tents are in the pipeline, including tents on the way and those on order that may not arrive until November.  The GOP reports that 100,000 tents have been distributed, and 150,000 tents are in the GOP pipeline, but this has not been confirmed.  Urgent shelter needs exist in Bagh, Balakot, Mansehra, and Batagram.  All tents must be winterized.  According to the GOP, 600,000 tents are needed to support a vulnerable population of 3,000,000 affected residents.  The critical window for the delivery of tents is the next four weeks, as the weather will then worsen.  13.  Although UNHCR would prefer to support spontaneous settlements, the GOP is pressuring UNHCR to establish large camps.  UNHCR is now working in five different locations, and the cluster reported that earthquake victims are now coming to UNHCR camps sites to obtain supplies and are then returning to their home sites.  This leads UNHCR to believe that the problem is one of distribution rather than the need for camps.  ----------------------- Camp Management -----------------------  14.  At the camp management cluster meeting on October 17, participants agreed that the goals of the camp management cluster are to avoid displacement by providing shelter and emergency relief items to people near their homes; provide assistance to informal settlements as a means of preventing the need for larger camps; establish camps only when necessary and keep them as small as possible; when necessary, provide technical assistance to camps established by others; and aim to adhere to Sphere standards.  The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) noted that in four weeks, the weather will change and there will be heavy snowfall.  ------------------- Protection -------------------  15.  The GOP is enforcing a quote No-Adoption end quote policy for the immediate future.  The GOP is also placing orphans in camps with relatives.  Children are currently not being registered as they are evacuated from hospitals. Assessments are being conducted at local hospitals to identify the number of children not registered.  -------------- Logistics --------------  16.  According to the USAID/DART, the military side of the airport is functioning efficiently; however, one of the major problems is the logjam at the civilian airport, as there are many pallets whose contents and owners are unknown.  The logistics cluster group meeting reported that a mapping system is needed for the distribution network. The USAID/DART Team Leader reported that the USAID/DART continues to work with military colleagues to coordinate the offloading and distribution of relief commodities.  For extremely large amounts of commodities, the USAID/DART has recommended that the military link with the U.N. Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) and /or the Pakistani military to arrange delivery.  The UNJLC is in the process of setting up a presence at the airport.  ------------------- Relief commodities -------------------  17.  On October 15, the USAID/DART Administrative Officer and the USAID/DART Public Affairs Officer flew by Chinook with the U.S. military to deliver a pallet of 225 blankets and water containers to Mercy Corps in the village of Jabori in the Sonar Valley.  After delivering the blankets and water containers, the team flew to Balakot to transport women and children needing additional medical treatment to Islamabad.  18.  On October 16, 17, 18, three USAID airlifts of relief commodities carrying tents arrived in Pakistan.  A total of 1,570 tents will be provided to Mercy Corps and transported to the Mansehra region to be distributed between the Battal and Siran valleys.  The value of this assistance including transport is USD 471,436.  19.  On October 18, a USAID airlift of 20 concrete cutting saws arrived in Pakistan.  The value of assistance, including transport, is USD 64,617.  20.  On October 18, two USAID airlifts of relief commodities arrived in Pakistan.  The two airlifts carried a total of 650 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,000 blankets, and 5,000 water containers.  The total value of this assistance, including transport, is USD 301,750.  ------------- Coordination -------------  21.  On October 17, the USAID/DART Team Leader met with representatives from DFID's Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (DFID CHAD) and the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department's Disaster Preparedness Program (DIPECHO) to discuss the coordination of relief efforts and develop a comprehensive response strategy between the three organizations.  22.   The USAID/DART reports that the GOP has made a credible effort to respond to the earthquake given the difficult circumstances, and relief activities are moving at a much faster pace than has been observed by the USAID/DART in other major disasters.  Although there are many problems, the USAID/DART expects to see an improvement in coordination as the GOP moves from a tactical to a more strategic mode.   CROCKER

(A) ISLAMABAD 15736      B. (B) ISLAMABAD 15463  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, d  1. (S) Summary: Islamist parties, clergy, and militant/extremist groups are using the Kashmir earthquake to strengthen their public image in affected areas...and to raise money.  Member parties of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) are engaged in independent relief efforts through their charitable foundations.  Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JUD), the parent organization of designated FTO Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LT) and most visible extremist group currently involved in relief operations, has already received favorable media coverage. In keeping with its long-standing practice, JUD will likely funnel a portion of charitable contributions for earthquake relief to support militant operations.  A number of Muslim charities are also engaged in relief efforts, most prominently Islamic Relief, which while not yet designated as a specially designated national and blocked person has been monitored by the USG for some time.  End Summary.  2. (S) The Islamist parties comprising the MMA are engaged in fundraising for earthquake relief through their charitable foundations.  Most prominent MMA leaders have already traveled to the earthquake zone for well-publicized tours. Al-Khidmat, the Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) charitable arm, is most prominent in Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK), while it shares the stage in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) with Al-Khair, Jamiate Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman's (JUI-F) charitable wing.  JI officials privately claimed to have raised nearly $5 million for relief.  (Note:  Post believes this figure is exaggerated.)  Both have established clinics and distribution points for blankets, food, water, and over-the-counter medicine.  JI and JUI-F have used their charitable arms to raise funds for terrorist/militant organizations in the past.  JUI-F seems to have severed its financial relations with such organizations, although the JI link with the FTO Hizbul Mujahideen may still exist and a portion of funds may be diverted there.  Officials from Jamiat Ulema Pakistan (JUP) and Tehrike Islami Pakistan (TIP) admitted that their parties' relief efforts have been miniscule, but claimed that they were a necessary and effective public relations tool.  3. (S) JUD is the most visible militant group engaged in relief operations, although we understand that Jaish-i-Muhammad, Harakat-ul-Mujahadeen, Harakat-ul-Jihad-i-Islam, and Hizbul Mujahideen have all launched smaller efforts.  Sectarian extremist groups Sipah-i-Mohammad, Sipah-i-Sahaba, and Sunni Tehrike are also carrying out relief work.  Only JUD and Sunni Tehrike are overtly fundraising, as others are officially "banned" organizations.  Regardless of their "banned" status, post suspected that these groups still raise funds through affiliated and sympathetic mosques, madrassas, and clergy, who routinely collect "charitable" donations during this Ramadan season.  JUD, like most Pakistani militant and sectarian organizations, has a long history of channeling a portion of all donations to their militant arms; post believes it will continue to do so.  4. (S)  JUD relief efforts have been prominently and positively highlighted in the local media.  Articles have praised JUD's working alongside the USG in distributing assistance, despite the USG's desire to have JUD declared a terrorist organization.  While the GOP has professed a desire to close JUD relief operations, no action has yet been taken.  5. (S) Several Kashmiri militant/terrorist and sectarian extremist organizations are raising funds overseas, either directly or through supportive clerics, particularly in the Persian Gulf, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt and Singapore. This revenue flow increases during Ramadan, as clergy seek zakat to support "charitable" efforts in Pakistan.  Pakistani clergy fundraise among Islamic communities in Europe and the United States; however, increasingly stringent visa requirements have limited the ability of supporters of extremist/militant/terrorist organizations to travel to these countries.  International Islamic charities are, of course, raising funds for the victims of the earthquake disaster worldwide.  Islamic Relief, in particular, has gained post's attention for its relatively aggressive posturing, including having its website listed on CNN and BBC as a possible contact for charitable donations.  (Note:  As Washington is aware, although Islamic Relief is not on Treasury's sanction list, it has been investigated and monitored by various USG agencies for some time. End note.)  6. (S) Comment:  The GOP faces a serious dilemma dealing with the proliferation of fundraising and relief efforts by militant/terrorist/extremist organizations, which President Musharraf has publicly promised to close as part of his crackdown on extremism.  While the fact that a portion of the money raised may be diverted to militant activity is disturbing, post is also concerned that volunteers from extremist parties have become the face of relief operations in some difficult-to-access parts of AJK.  With organized relief efforts reaching into remote areas of the disaster zone, post believes that GOP and international actors will supplant militant organizations as the primary source of assistance, leading to quiet closure of militant relief operations with little negative public reactions.

A) ISLAMABAD 15769 (NOTAL)      B. B) BUTENIS-ENGELKEN OCT 20 E-MAIL  1.  With snow already falling on some areas affected by the October 8 earthquake, getting winterized tents or other forms of shelter to those whose homes were destroyed is quickly emerging as a critical element of relief efforts.  Given the magnitude of the crisis -- the current estimate is three million people were left homeless by the quake -- we will clearly need to draw on tent supplies throughout the world, and call on the resources of the international community to help transport them to Pakistan.  2.  GOP Vice Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Hayat, contacted Ambassador on October 19 and explained that a Mr. Khalid Osman, a Pakistani living in Toronto (tel:  416-938-6909) has raised funds and purchased 7500 winterized tents, each accommodating six people, and is now looking for assistance in transporting them from Canada to Pakistan.  (Note:  we have not been able to confirm the whereabouts of these tents or their suitability for the harsh winter climate of northern Pakistan.  end note.)  Apparently Mr. Osman contacted Pakistan International Airlines, which said it would take three months to transport all the tents -- clearly too long to meet the urgent need.  The GOP has asked for U.S. assistance in transporting those tents to Pakistan, but our own lift capability is already taxed.  3.  Post would appreciate Department or Ottawa contacting the Canadian Government to ask that, as part of Canada's contribution to earthquake relief, it arrange to air lift these tents to Pakistan, either through milair or by chartering civilian aircraft.  Providing winterized tents for 45,000 people would be a major step in addressing the shelter crisis.  4.  On October 21, Embassy raised this with Canadian High Commission in Islamabad, which is now conveying Mr. Osman's request to Ottawa.  5.  Early response would be appreciated so we can factor this into our own planning.  For Department and Embassy use: should the tents prove suitable for the affected areas, and Canadian Government not be prepared to tranport them to Pakistan, post will recommend using U.S. earthquake relief funds to charter aircraft to bring them to Pakistan.

On October 21, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that 62,000 tents were delivered to Pakistan by the international community and 50,000 tents have been delivered by the Government of Pakistan (GOP). IOM further stated that there are currently 194,000 tents available in the international community pipeline, and 45,000 to 210,000 shelters are needed.  The Pakistani military has established sites for 5,000 families (30,000 individuals) in Balakot and Batagram and 3,000 families (18,000 individuals) in Gari Habibullah.  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is also discussing with the Pakistani military the establishment of additional camps in Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Shangla, and 10 other locations. USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) team members in Muzaffarabad continue to report that tents are the priority.  On October 21, the shelter cluster group in Muzaffarabad reported that 1,300 to 1,400 tents have been distributed in the district to date.  Seven to eight percent of Muzaffarabad is considered at high altitude and/or inaccessible, and access to small villages remains a problem.  End summary.  --------------------- Death Tolls ---------------------  2.  According to the Pakistani Federal Relief Commissioner, as of October 21, the October 8 earthquake killed 49,739 people and injured 74,000 others.  The official death toll in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) alone is 37,958. The most-affected district is Mansehra, where 32,653 deaths and 12,814 injuries have been confirmed thus far.  ------------ Health ------------  3.  On October 19, a USAID/Pakistan representative attended an emergency health cluster meeting and reported that the Ministry of Health (MOH) discussed the importance of the non- governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting widows, children, orphans, and the elderly.  Anti-tetanus globulin remains an urgent need, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is trying to meet this need.  The MOH representative at the cluster meeting reported that the number of amputations is increasing, and this will lead to a significant need for rehabilitation services.  A committee has been formed to assess the rehabilitation needs of the affected population. The MOH is setting up intermediate centers in Islamabad to house women and children who are displaced because they are in Islamabad to receive medical care.  4.  According to the GOP, 100 3-person medical teams, consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a medical student, have been dispatched to affected areas to treat people, particularly children, suffering from shock.  The health cluster group also reported that Save the Children- U.S. has opened a field hospital in Batagram.  -------------- Food --------------  5.  On October 19, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended the food cluster group meeting and reported that the flash appeal will be completed on October 21.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) reported that there is still an urgent need to determine the number and locations of people who need food assistance, as well as the number of people migrating to cities from villages.  Vitamin A supplementation distribution and measles vaccinations have begun in affected areas.    ----------------- Shelter -----------------  6.  On October 19, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended the shelter cluster meeting and reported that a shelter cluster working group paper was circulated and proposed the following alternatives to winterized tents:       --Improvised housing:  constructed using materials from donated buildings and donated materials, most likely with wooden frames.       --Rehabilitated housing: repairing structurally sound earthquake damaged buildings.       --Warm Room: (variant of rehabilitated housing) winterizing and heating a single room of a structurally sound damaged building.       --Host family housing:  survivors share housing with families whose housing is intact.  7.  IOM reported that statistics on the number of tents being provided for earthquake survivors and those on the way are still not exact.  The shelter cluster is trying to determine if the 100,000 tents reportedly at GOP disposal and the 150,000 tents in the GOP pipeline include donated tents.  On October 21, the USAID/DART Deputy Team Leader spoke with an IOM representative who stated that 62,000 tents were delivered to Pakistan by the international community and 50,000 tents have been delivered by the GOP. IOM further stated that there are currently 194,000 tents available in the international community pipeline, and 45,000 to 210,000 shelters are needed.  The IOM representative noted that there is no information regarding the GOP's pipeline.  IOM has also not been able to confirm whether the GOP has requisitioned tents.  8.  IOM stated that it has had discussions with the leaders of the camp management and logistics cluster on an overall shelter strategy but that so far no conclusions had been reached.  9.  The Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN) reported that it has been working from Mansehra, in conjunction with the Pakistani military and local officials, and has established approximately 11 camps of 50 tents each.  RSPN discovered that rather than staying in large camps, people preferred to live closer to their own property; for this reason RSPN's camp sizes are small, and many people have chosen to take tents and supplies to locations closer to their own property.  10.  On October 21, a shelter meeting was held in Muzaffarabad and the cluster group reported that 1,300 to 1,400 tents have been distributed in the district to date. [Note.  This does not include GOP data or data on tents flown in or trucked in directly from Islamabad.  End Note.] Alternative shelter kits are being developed, as well as a shelter repair (warm/dry room concept) strategy.  Seven to eight percent of Muzaffarabad is considered at high altitude and/or inaccessible, and access to small villages remains a problem.  Teams from Oxfam are making visits to villages and organizing deliveries of relief supplies upon returning to town.  IOM does not yet have a presence in Muzaffarabad, and they are needed to centralize data as well as interface with the GOP and others.  ---------------------- Camp Management ----------------------  11.  UNHCR continues to work closely with the Pakistani military to establish camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).  The Pakistani military has established sites for 5,000 families (30,000 individuals) in Balakot and Batagram and 3,000 families (18,000 individuals) in Gari Habibullah. The Gari Habibullah site needs brush clearance and leveling before it can be expanded.  Thus far, UNHCR has provided the Pakistani military with 1,000 tents, and approximately 400 tents have been erected.  UNHCR has 12,000 tents in Mansehra, but it will release them and emergency relief supplies gradually to the Pakistani military, which can erect about 200 tents a day.  The International Medical Corps has already established basic health units in the Balakot and Batagram camps.  12.  UNHCR is also discussing with the Pakistani military the establishment of additional camps in Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Shangla, and 10 other locations.  Since land is at a premium in the mountainous terrain, camps will be crowded and need careful planning, especially in the water and sanitation sectors.  13.  UNHCR has had only a small team of its Pakistani staff in the field; however, with its supply chain in place, UNHCR will deploy international staff and plans to staff five locations by October 21.  UNHCR has brought in seven additional international staff members to help with its camp management activities.  UNHCR's primary goals are organization and assistance to informal settlements and the provision of tents and emergency relief supplies to those who want to be located near their destroyed homes.  UNHCR will continue to publicize its efforts to provide camp and non-camp alternatives to those who have lost their homes.  ---------------- Protection -----------------  14.  According to the GOP, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has been mobilized to register and collect data and photographs of all injured and displaced persons, as well as unattended children and women to ensure their safety and security.  --------------- Logistics ---------------  15.  The U.N. Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) is working with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on logistical issues.  Map Action will be conducting a slope analysis of earthquake affected areas to determine what terrain can support tents.  On October 20, the logistics cluster meeting reported that the NATO airbridge has started, and NATO has agreed to let non-NATO members and U.N. related agencies use the air bridge on a one-off basis.  16.  The USAID/DART was distressed to hear that the U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan Egeland was calling for a quote Berlin-style airlift end quote for Pakistan.  The USAID/DART reports that the airports are already congested, and forward movement from the airports to remote areas is the main constraint.  The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has worked closely with the GOP to ensure the maximum number of airlifts within the constraints of safety and air traffic congestion.  The number of landing slots available for helicopters is saturated, and additional airlift capacity that is not coordinated with the GOP or Pakistani military could exacerbate the problem.  The USAID/DART is trying to meet with the U.N. to obtain clarification on Egeland's comments.  --------------------- Education ---------------------  17.  The USAID/DART U.N. Liaison Officer (UNLO) met with the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) to discuss the use of medium and large tents for clinics and schools.  Both organizations were interested in the USAID/DART's suggestions, and the USAID/DART will further discuss this option once the needs have been determined.  The USAID/DART is working with USAID/Pakistan to determine appropriate spaces for these tent schools and clinics and working with the DOD to provide the large tents to UNICEF and WHO.  USAID/Pakistan sent a three-person foreign service national (FSN) team to Muzaffarabad to work with Ministry of Education (MOE) authorities to test the concept of tents for schools.  USAID/Pakistan will expand the project based upon this assessment.  --------------------------------------------- ----- USAID/DART Activities in Muzaffarabad - October 19 --------------------------------------------- -----  18.  As of October 19, two members of the USAID/DART have established a full-time USAID/DART presence in Muzaffarabad. The team reported that according to the U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team representative in Muzaffarabad, all relief commodities arriving in Muzaffarabad are being helicoptered to affected villages for distribution.  The U.N. stated that relief commodities are not arriving in Muzaffarabad quickly enough.  The team reported that that the Pakistani Kashmir government has said that 239,000 tents are needed in the area. [Note.  There are many contradictory figures on the number of tents that are currently needed.  These numbers are unconfirmed.  End Note.]  19.  The U.N. reported that all trauma patients in the area have been evacuated from Muzaffarabad.  The USAID/DART Health Officer (HO) reported that the U.N. believes that the number of casualties being flown to Muzaffarabad has markedly decreased in the last day or so.  20.  On October 19, representatives of several international militaries, the U.N., and NGOs planned to meet to discuss dividing affected areas geographically and to establish priorities in geographic areas.  This plan will be given to the Pakistani military for approval.  21.  The USAID/DART reports that the U.N. will try to place a U.N. Liaison officer with the Pakistani military in Muzaffarabad in order to facilitate flights and coordination.  22.  The USAID/DART spoke to a representative of the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) who reported that Balakot is completely destroyed.  The USAID/DART Structural Specialist also confirmed this information at the shelter cluster meeting where the group reported that the earthquake damaged between 73.5 percent and 90 percent of Balakot.  --------------------------------------------- ------ USAID/DART Activities in Muzaffarabad - October 20 --------------------------------------------- ------  23.  On October 20, the USAID/DART conducted assessments of the two villages of Doong and Dunna, both located approximately 40 minutes northwest of Muzaffarabad.  The team reported that there is no running water, and the villages have not received any relief supplies as supplies are being distributed to villagers at lower altitudes.  In the village of Doong, there are approximately 300 residents and 71 houses.  Fifteen people were killed by the earthquake.  The only building that is still standing is the primary school, and students started their first day of school after the earthquake on October 19.  In Dunna, there are approximately 40 houses, and while the school was damaged, students have started classes again elsewhere. AD/W FOR DCHA/OFDA  24.  According to the USAID/DART, both villages need approximately 50 tents each, and local residents reported that it will start snowing in a month and will continue to snow in some areas until June.  Both villages previously received water through a pipeline that was disrupted due to the earthquake.  Villagers are now obtaining water from streams, distribution points, or bringing it back from elsewhere.  The team noted that both villages have some food and water, but sanitation is now becoming a major issue.  25.  The USAID/DART HO reported that at Abbas hospital in Muzaffarabad, many patients do not want to leave after they have been treated since they have nowhere to go as their homes are destroyed.  The Abbas hospital will have to shut down its surgical capacity as there is a lack of bed space. The USAID/HO noted that doctors are starting to see patients with respiratory illnesses, and there does not appear to be any type of disease tracking system in place.  --------------- USAID Airlifts ---------------  26.  On October 18, two USAID airlifts of relief commodities arrived in Pakistan.  The two airlifts carried 650 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,000 blankets, and 5,000 water containers.  The total value of this assistance, including transport, is USD 301,750.   The relief commodities were provided to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and will be delivered to Bisham, Kohistan, and Mansehra.  27.  On October 18, a USAID airlift of 20 concrete cutting saws arrived in Pakistan.  The value of assistance, including transport, is USD 64,617.  The saws were given to Pakistani Civil Defense.  28.  According to the USAID/DART Military Liaison Officer (MLO), as of October 21, the U.S. military has transported 3,124,000 pounds of relief commodities including food, medicines, tents, water, blankets, and clothes to Pakistan to assist earthquake affected victims.  The USAID/DART has facilitated the distribution of approximately 15 percent of these commodities.  29.  As of October 20, USAID/OFDA has provided shelter materials for 67,500 people and blankets for 15,000 persons. USAID/OFDA has distributed medical supplies for 100,000 people for 3 months to treat injuries and disease.  To keep people healthy, USAID/OFDA is providing water treatment to supply safe drinking water to 20,000 people every day, water containers for 15,000 families, and water storage capacity for 8 communities.

Butenis, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1. (C)  On October 21, the Afghan Embassy confirmed to post that AfghQsident Karzai plans to make a short condolence visit to Pakistan on Monday, October 24.  According to Afghan Ambassador Tarzi, President Karzai will call on President Musharraff and PM Aziz, followed by a press event.  The Pakistani MFA confirmed to post that a Karzai visit is in the works, but could not confirm the October 24 date.  In addition to preparing for this brief half-day visit, the Afghan Embassy is waiting for the Goverment of Pakistan (GOP) to propose a date for a longer official visit by President Karzai after Ramadan.  (Note:  Ambassador Tarzi attributed the delay in fixing a date for this longer visit to the government's attention being focused on earthquake relief, rather than to any reluctance by the GOP to receive the Afghan delegation.  End note.)  2.  (C)  Karzai would be the third head of state to visit Pakistan to offer condolences following the October 8 earthquake, following visits by King Abdullah of Jordan (October 16) and PM Erdogan of Turkey (October 20-21).  3.  (C)  Comment:  If the October 24 meeting visit occurs, it will be the first Musharraf-Karzai meeting since President Karzai's visit to Islamabad in March 2005.  Although personal relations between the two presidents have been strained since then, this visit is a sign that the atmosphere is continuing to warm following a Karzai-Musharraf telephone conversation earlier this month.

ISLAMABAD 15680 AND PREVIOUS       B. ISLAMABAD 15728      C. RIYADH 7591  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  As the United States prepares for the October 26th Geneva Donors' Conference on the South Asian Earthquake, we face a challenge and an opportunity of almost unprecedented magnitude.  Without indulging in hyperbole, I can assure you that Pakistan - our frontline ally in the war on terror -- is faced with a calamity of stunning proportions.  In the two weeks since the October 8 earthquake, we have come to realize that early projections of human and property losses were well short of the emerging reality.  Today the UN almost doubled its flash appeal for relief assistance to Pakistan:  the inital call for USD 272 million has been raised to USD 522 million to fund shelter, nutrition, health care and logistical support for the next six months.  In order to make a difference on the ground, given the scale of the destruction, and to retain our position on the moral high ground here and throughout the Muslim world, I urge that the U.S. delegation arrive in Geneva prepared to pledge USD 500 million in relief and reconstrution assistance.  Relief Operations -- Acute Need for Months, Not Weeks --------------------------------------------- --------  2.  (SBU) Official estimates from Government of Pakistan (GOP) now place the confirmed death toll at more than 50,000, with another 75,000 seriously injured and 2.5 - 3 million homeless.  These numbers will continue to rise as relief crews push into ever more remote valleys and hamlets. Despite 16 days of 24/7 operations, relief has yet to reach perhaps one-quarter of the population in inaccessible areas of the disaster zone.  Entire cities have been leveled and hundreds of isolated villages have simply vanished. Infrastructure -- roads, bridges, power supplies, telecommunications -- throughout Pakistan-controlled Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) and large swaths of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) has been destroyed.  I do not exaggerate when I say that the GOP is facing a cataclysm of relief and reconstruction needs, demands on a scale that no country other than the U.S. could face alone.  3.  (C)    For our part, we are rapidly burning through the initial USD 50 million announced by the White House on October 9th.  This does not included the non-monetized expenses of the U.S. military units that are sustaining the GOP's present relief operations.  This will not/not taper off anytime soon.  The hard truth is that the "acute phase" of the disaster will last for months and that Pakistan will require the combined assistance of USG agencies -- USAID/DART, State and all four military services -- for the foreseeable future.  Even with this extraordinary U.S. mega-relief mission, we are not even close to addressing the magnitude of the relief and reconstruction challenges facing Pakistan.  U.S. officials who have seen the disaster zone first-hand have immediately understood that we must factor acute relief needs for shelter, heavy engineering, health care and logistical support continuing well into the next year into our assistance strategy, even as we simultaneously map out long-term support for the region's reconstruction.  Looking Toward Reconstruction -- What Can the U.S. Do? --------------------------------------------- ---------  4.  (C)  To make a lasting difference as Pakistan rebuilds AJK and NWFP -- two regions which collectively qualify as a jihad heartland -- we must go to Geneva prepared to challenge all donors to think big and dig deep.  The near complete loss of physical and social infrastructure demands a multi-national reconstruction effort on the scale of the international response to tsunami earlier this year.  I therefore urge that the U.S. delegation inspire other donors by announcing a pledge of USD 500 million directed toward reconstruction of the education and health sectors:  -- In health care, the USG would have a significant effect by committing to rebuild, equip and staff both tertiary hospitals destroyed in NWFP and AJK, as well as dozens of district hospitals and primary health care facilities.  -- In education, some 2500 schools were destroyed in NWFP and more than 3100 in AJK.  The USG should rebuild at least 200 primary schools, 20 middle schools and 10 high schools in each of the two provinces, as well as restore the Hazara University in the Mansehra District of NWFP and AJK University in Rawalkot.  5.  (C)  In addition to these two vital tasks, the U.S. should also offer to facilitate the GOP's reconstruction plans by offering technical assistance in earthquake-resistant construction technologies, including hands-on training for the architects, engineers and construction workers who will rebuild houses, schools, clinics and businesses.  What Can the U.S. Get Others To Do? -----------------------------------  6.  (C)  Even a pledge of USD 500 million will only scratch away at the mountain of reconstruction needs facing the GOP. Just as Pakistan cannot shoulder this burden alone, neither can we -- we must do everything possible to ensure a strong international commitment to Pakistan's long-term recovery. Although I remain concerned about the success of the October 26th Geneva Conference (Ref B), an early and strong USG pledge at Geneva is the best means of spurring other donors into action.  Several of the Gulf states have made generous pledges and may be willing to do more.  Europeans hesitant to donate to the GOP out of fear of corruption and questions regarding transparency could take heart from a vigorous U.S. response.  We must encourage these donors to take on projects of a similar scale: rebuilding roads, restoring bridges, reconnecting power grids and communication systems.  Just as the USG is leveraging its emergency relief assistance -- responding to GOP requests for four hospitals by supplying two ourselves and identifying partners who can provide the remainder -- we must also leverage our reconstruction dollars to challenge the international community to do the same.   Generosity Now Will Pay Dividends Later ---------------------------------------  7.  (C)  The U.S. role in the Geneva Conference will be a pivotal point for securing Pakistan's new-found confidence that we are sincere in our commitment to a long-term strategic relationship.  Our strong showing in supporting emergency relief operations has prompted many in Pakistan to re-evaluate their image of America.  The U.S. has not enjoyed such a positive reception by the Pakistan people, press and public officials in decades.  Expectations are high, both here and throughout the Muslim world.  Other donors are looking to us to set the bar.  (Note: In addition to snipes in the international press that the inital U.S. pledge of USD 50 million was parsimonious, we have seen reports that other large donors -- including the Saudis (Ref C) -- have been less than impressed with the USG's public donation. End note.)  We risk squandering these gains if our leadership in Geneva, both in terms of the generosity of our pledge and our ability to generate commensurate international support, is insufficient to the task.  If we arrive in Geneva with a bold program and the resources to back it up, even the skeptics will take note that the U.S. is as willing to fight extremism and instability by investing in Pakistan's recovery -- and, by extension, the Muslim world -- as it is to underwriting the war on terror.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 015959  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2015 TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, EAID, MASS, PGOV, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: KASHMIRI GOVERNMENT VIEWED AS INEFFECTIVE IN EARTHQUAKE CRISIS  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1. (C) Summary:  The autonomous Government of Azad Jammu Kashmir (GAJK) has played virtually no role in earthquake relief.  Its bureaucracy was devastated along with the capital of Muzzafarabad, while its political leadership (most of which was in Islamabad at the time of the earthquake) has been roundly criticized for a non-existent performance. Senior Kashmiri politicians are involved in individual relief activities and well-publicized tours of disaster areas, but have not wanted to be linked with GOP-relief efforts that many Kashmiris view as inadequate.  Recognizing that their political fortunes are inextricably linked to continued GOP support, most Kashmiri politicians have been silent on GOP relief efforts.  Several prominent Kashmiris have privately cautioned against any involvement by the GAJK or its bureaucrats in reconstruction efforts, citing widespread corruption in previous development projects.  Instead, they believe that coordination should be done through local community councils and legitimate Kashmiri politicians (read Muslim Conference (MC) and All Parties Huriyat Conference (APHC)).  End Summary.  2. (C) To date, the GAJK has played a minimal role in relief efforts.  Its bureaucracy, mostly based in Muzzafarabad, was decimated by the earthquake, leaving many employees dead, injured, mourning family members, or homeless.  Although there were some stories of amazing efforts on the part of individual AJK civil servants, government generally was absent in the quake's immediate aftermath.  When authority was reestablished, it was largely by the military, which remains in effective control in the affected areas with some support from federal civil servants imported from other parts of the country.  Many Kashmiri civil society activists actually welcomed the GAJK bureaucracy's absence from relief efforts, noting its tendencies towards corruption and inept management.  3. (C) The political leadership of the GAJK was largely outside of Muzzafarabad at the time of the earthquake. (Note:  Most senior Kashmiri politicians divide their time between Muzzafarabad and Islamabad, spending the majority in the federal capital.  End Note).  Many, like the AJK Prime Minister, returned to Muzzafarabad within 48-hours of the earthquake, generally with television crews and journalists in tow.  While all have spent a great deal of time touring the affected areas and raising funds, none have taken an active role in the coordination of relief or long-term planning for reconstruction.  Even erstwhile political allies have criticized the AJK Prime Minister and his cabinet for being largely absent from disaster management activities and allowing the federal bureaucracy to take the lead.  Following long-standing practice, the Federal Relief Commission has coordinated central government efforts with minimal GAJK involvement.  4. (C) Kashmiri politicians have for the most part chosen to absent themselves from formal GOP relief efforts.  Instead, they and their respective political parties have been independently raising and distributing funds and donations to earthquake victims.  Those that we have spoken with since the disaster, largely from the MC and the APHC, claim privately that many Kashmiris remain resentful of what they view as inadequate central government assistance.  Even so, with the exception of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (a pro-independence party with few ties to the GOP), Kashmiri leaders have been largely silent on GOP-relief efforts. Comment:  This likely reflects the historical reality that politicians in AJK are largely dependent on the GOP for their political viability.  End Comment.  5. (C) All interlocutors agree that the Kashmiri people must be actively involved in reconstruction.  There is a high-level of skepticism, however, that the GAJK is suited to administer, or even play an active role, in such efforts. The GAJK is widely-viewed as corrupt, incompetent, and illegitimate.  One long-time civil society activist claimed that nearly 65 percent of development projects previously launched by the GAJK were never carried out, despite funds being spent.  Others report that senior GAJK officials and their family members, including the Prime Minister, have already established new "construction companies" in the hope of obtaining a portion of reconstruction funds.  The JKLF is advocating that Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent organization of designated foreign terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyaba) be taken seriously as a reconstruction partner.  Senior APHC and MC figures have publicly and privately suggested that reconstruction is best coordinated through local community councils (appointed advisory bodies established throughout the area that substitute for local elected government) and that "legitimate" Kashmiri parties (i.e. MC and APHC) should be invited to participate in federal reconstruction bodies.  6. (C) Comment:  The earthquake has swept away even the nominal fiction of an autonomous GAJK.  The paralysis of both its bureaucracy and political leadership during this crisis has made federal intervention essential.  As focus shifts from immediate relief to reconstruction, it will become increasingly important for Kashmiris to be involved in planning and execution.  While coordination through the GAJK would be the simplest route logistically, post believes that its poor development track record disqualifies the GAJK as a credible implementing partner.  The GOP, will need to find ways to involve local communities, perhaps through community councils and political parties, directly in reconstruction, as a corollary to more robust discussions with the GAJK leadership.  End Comment. CROCKER

CROCKER.  REASONS: 1.4(B)(D)  1.  (C) Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a brief visit to Pakistan October 24 to express condolences and support for Pakistan in the aftermath of the October 8 earthquake. Afghan Ambassador Tarzi told us that from his perspective, the visit went very well.  Karzai first met with Musharraf who expressed his appreciation for helicopter support and a medical team from Afghanistan.  Musharraf also said that Pakistan hoped to benefit from Afghanistan's expertise in managing a massive reconstruction effort with international assistance.  The two leaders then discussed their remarkably similar and largely negative views of NGOs and their agenda, which Tarzi said may not have been overly helpful as Pakistan looks to international assistance but served to strengthen the personal rapport between the two.  Karzai emphasized his visit was a show of solidarity and support, and he and Musharraf agreed that Karzai would return after the Eid holiday for broader-ranging discussions.  2.  (C) Karzai subsequently saw Prime Minister Aziz who emphasized that a strong, stable Afghanistan was at the top of Pakistan's regional priorities.  He stressed in particular the importance of the economic relationship, noting that when he had visited Kabul as finance minister and predicted bilateral trade at the $1 billion level, he had been greeted with considerable skepticism.  Trade now exceeds $1.2 billion.  When the discussion veered over into NGOs, Aziz provided something of an antidote noting that they could be an annoyance but also played a crucial role in mobilizing and sustaining international support.  Tarzi said that Karzai and Aziz had a 30-minute one-on-one; he did not have a readout.  3.  (C)  Aziz accompanied Karzai back to the airport and joined him for a brief meeting with the Afghan helo crews and medical teams, with a huge gaggle of Pakistani media in tow. Tarzi said that Karzai had been especially appreciative of this gesture, and predicted it would have a very favorable impact in Afghanistan.  4.  (C) Comment:  This was a good gesture by Karzai, well received and reciprocated by the Pakistani leadership.  It adds further momentum to our combined efforts to get this important relationship back on an even keel. CROCKER

The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) continues to facilitate the movement of excess U.S. military commodities to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for distribution in affected areas.  The USAID/DART  observed market activity and the delivery of food stocks to private businesses in Muzaffarabad.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) is attempting to obtain a needs assessment of the affected areas.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) hospital is receiving patients in Muzaffarabad, and a U.S. mobile army surgical hospital (MASH) is becoming operational.  The U.N. and the Pakistani military have developed a long-term six-week transportation plan for relief commodities that will be presented for approval to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) on October 25.  ------------ Death Toll ------------  2.  As of October 23, the GOP reported that the earthquake killed 51,382 people and injured 74,498 others.  According to the U.N., the number of severely affected people is 1.9 million.  Severely affected refers to those individuals who have been affected in more than three clusters (clusters include food and nutrition, shelter, health, and water and sanitation).  --------------------------------------------- --------- Water and Sanitation - October 22 meeting in Islamabad --------------------------------------------- --------- 3.  On October 22, the USAID/DART Water and Sanitation Officer (WSO) attended the water and sanitation cluster meeting and reported that the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other members of the water sanitation sector are aggressively addressing water and sanitation needs in earthquake affected areas.  While water issues are being successfully addressed as relief organizations gain access to affected populations, sanitation related interventions are not as aggressively implemented.  Therefore, the water and sanitation cluster group is promoting sanitation interventions in affected areas and making sanitation the primary focus of the water and sanitation sector.  The cluster group believes the focus by relief organizations on safe water interventions without a corresponding aggressive sanitation intervention campaign will place the affected populations at risk of gastro-intestinal diseases.  The cluster group is actively promoting sanitation and has stated that future meetings shall be devoted to strategizing and identifying solutions to sanitation related issues. 4.  The water and sanitation cluster group's plan to address needs in rural areas is to establish supply centers in valleys where water treatment tablets, soap, and water containers will be distributed and hygiene education will occur.  These activities are a priority due to the possibility that rural residents may soon be isolated due to winter weather.  The plan for urban areas is to meet SPHERE standards in urban camp settings, focusing on sanitation interventions such as latrine construction, soap distribution, and hygiene promotion. 5.  UNICEF stated there is a shortage of pre-fabricated latrine slabs.  Oxfam is supplying 1,000 plastic slabs, and UNICEF has contracted with a metal shop in Islamabad for the construction of 1,000 metal latrine slabs.  The metal shop reported to UNICEF that they could construct 100 slabs per day.  If the metal slabs prove acceptable, UNICEF hopes to contract with other metal shops to increase production. 6.  UNICEF is facilitating water and sanitation cluster meetings three times weekly in the humanitarian relief hubs of Muzaffarabad and Mansehra.  Cluster meetings have unofficially started in the hubs of Batagram, Bagh, and Balakot.  Water sanitation meetings in these areas are facilitated by NGO entities designated by UNICEF with the approval of the sector cluster.  Leads in the three hubs are as follows: Batagram-Life for Relief and Development; Bagh- Islamic Relief; Balakot- Oxfam.  UNICEF stated that water sanitation interventions will be directed at the district level. 7.  UNICEF stated that the greatest immediate need is human resources.  UNICEF is expanding its water and sanitation staff to nine employees and hopes to increase the number of national water and sanitation specialists on their staff. UNICEF stated that the present numbers of relief workers addressing water sanitation issues in country is inadequate for the huge area affected by the earthquake.  The cluster group hopes to see an increase in NGO presence in-country over the next several weeks. --------------------------------------------- --- Water and Sanitation - Meetings in Muzaffarabad --------------------------------------------- ---- 8.  On October 24, the USAID/DART conducted a survey of the water and sanitation situation in Muzaffarabad and observed that the streets were relatively free of large piles of solid waste.  Residents were observed obtaining water from public water taps.  The USAID/DART tested water from the piped water system, and the test indicated the water was treated with chlorine.  There was no evidence of open defecation in public areas visited by team members. 9.  A U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) medical officer in Muzaffarabad told the USAID/DART WSO that the infectious disease surveillance system revealed no unusual increases in communicable diseases in the areas reporting data.  The WHO medical officer stated that sanitation in rural areas is a concern, and WHO is adding a water and sanitation specialist to the WHO team to improve its technical capacity in sanitation intervention activities. 10.  The Oxfam Public Health Coordinator stated that Oxfam and the local government have initiated a solid waste clean- up program which had been very effective.  Oxfam supported the local government in re-establishing solid waste collection and is having community clean-up campaigns.  The Public Health Coordinator stated that Oxfam is heavily involved in providing water and building latrines.  Oxfam has built 89 community latrines at camps in Muzaffarabad. Oxfam reported that there were not many people in the camps, and most people are staying near their homes or have left to go to Islamabad. 11.  The CRS Water Sanitation Specialist stated that CRS is no longer providing water sanitation services in Muzaffarabad.  CRS is focusing water sanitation interventions on rural and semi-urban areas.  ----------------------- Food and Nutrition -----------------------  12.  On October 21, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended the food and nutrition cluster group meeting and reported that cluster group participants are still uncertain as to how food will actually get to people in affected areas.  The group reported that the U.N. Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) and the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) needs to double and triple some of their services, especially air capacity within Pakistan.  As the weather starts to changes, ration requirements will change.  WFP will try to incorporate this information into its plans. WFP hopes that its aerial assessments will be able to produce a need assessment of what food is needed, what bridges and roads are accessible, etc. by October 26.  WFP is putting together a strategy for rubhall (tent warehouse) storage capacity at the three hubs in Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, and Bagh.  WFP plans to have a 45-day supply of food at each rubhall hub.  --------------- Health ---------------  13.  The USAID/DART Health Officer (HO) reported that a 100- bed ICRC hospital in Muzaffarabad opened on October 21. ICRC is tracking the names of family members and villages, and if a child is under the age of 15, an adult may remain with the child in the hospital.  The ICRC hospital started receiving patients on October 21.  14.  The Abbas hospital in Muzaffarabad received 787 patients on October 20.  The hospital was damaged, but reopened a few days after the earthquake and has received a total of 10,549 patients since then.  Abbas hospital currently has zero bed capacity and is two to three days from stopping intake of new patients.  15.  Many are encouraging the medical quote tent village end quote idea due to the lack of capacity at the Abbas hospital.  The GOP is starting a basic health unit.  The establishment of a U.S. MASH started on October 21.  The hospital will be located at the Prime Minister's Secretariat.  The U.S. MASH will be able to start surgeries  SIPDIS by the evening of October 25.  16.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to immunize 120,000 people against measles, tuberculosis (TB), diphtheria- pertussis-tetanus (DPT), and polio.  Vitamin A distributions are also occurring.  The MOH mobilized four mobile health teams on October 21, and started a health unit in Bagh and Relakot on the same day. --------------------------- Logistics and Coordination ---------------------------  17.  The USAID/DART U.N. Liaison officer (UNLO) reported that the U.N. and the Pakistani military have developed a long-term six-week transportation plan.  The plan will be presented to the GOP for approval on October 25.  Under this plan, all critical items such as shelter materials, emergency relief supplies, and food would be transported from Islamabad to Abbottabad primarily by truck.  At Abbottabad, the Pakistani military and U.N. would establish a heavy lift capacity helicopter base.  From Abbottabad, heavy helicopters would be used to move goods to four locations:  Batagram, Naran, Muzaffarabad, and Chakothi. From these four locations, smaller helicopters would be used to transport items to villages at higher elevations and valleys. 18.  The USAID/DART reports that as of October 24, the U.N. currently has 5 MI-8 helicopters in country, and they are expecting 3 additional Chinook CH-47s in the next 24 hours. These Chinooks were provided by the U.K. Royal Air Force and donated by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID)  19.  On October 24, the USAID/DART team facilitated the movement of excess U.S. military commodities to include 15,000 blankets to GOAL for distribution in Bagh, 43 tents to UNICEF, 1,536 sleeping bags and 840 cases of rations to Mercy Corps, and 107 cartons of medical supplies to WHO.  Of the 43 tents, 22 will be transported to Muzaffarabad and 21 to Mansehra.  These medium-sized tents will be used for schools.  20.  The USAID/DART UNLO reported that UNHAS plans to schedule a meeting with militaries who have flight capacity in Pakistan.  This includes the Pakistani, Japanese, German, American, and British militaries.  The meeting will also include the U.N. and international organizations.  The UNLO spoke to the Joint Task Force (JTF) Liaison Officer (LNO) at the Civil Military Coordination cell to request that the U.S. military possibly play a role in the planning of this meeting.  21.  The U.N. has three hubs in Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, and Bagh.  One-thousand NATO troops will be arriving on October 24.  This mixed battalion will include engineering and medical specialists, and they will be focusing on road infrastructure, latrines, and clearing land for temporary shelters and structures.  --------------- Tent Cities ---------------  22.  According to local media reports, the Cabinet Committee on Earthquake Relief, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation has decided to set up two quote tent cities end quote for earthquake victims.  The committee has decided that these tent cities will be in Fateh Jang and Chakal.  The tent cities will have electricity, water, and health, and education services.  ----------------------- USAID/DART Assessments -----------------------  23.  On October 23 and 24, the USAID/DART in Muzaffarabad examined damage in Muzaffarabad.  While the team observed many destroyed buildings, streets were clear of debris and a large number of businesses were open.  The team observed many customers visiting shops.  Goods being sold included large amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables and freshly butchered meat.  Streets were clogged with traffic including large commercial trucks transporting food, dry goods, and animal fodder.  The team saw residents rehabilitating buildings and clearing debris and rubble.  The team's interpreter reported that food is being sold on the market in Muzaffarabad at 10 percent above the pre-earthquake price.   CROCKER

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ISLAMABAD 016051  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A MANILA - PLEASE PASS TO USADB AMB PAUL SPELTZ  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, PREF, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  MBS GEARING UP FOR RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE IN ADVANCE OF OCTOBER 26 GENEVA MEETING AND NOVEMBER 18 ISLAMABAD DONOR CONFERENCE   1.  (SBU) Summary:  Although the detailed needs assessment is just beginning, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are trying to come up with funds to support reconstruction needs following Pakistan's October 8 earthquake.  The World Bank board will vote October 25 on a $200 million package of earthquake-related enhancements to two existing Bank projects; the board will also take a first look at upcoming initiatives to provide an additional $270 million for earthquake reconstruction ($240 million in new funds for existing projects, $30 million in reprogrammed funds from savings identified in existing programs).  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is trying to come up with $200 million ($80 million in grant aid, $120 million in Asian Development Fund concessional lending), and is also trying to obtain GOP agreement to reprogram $100 million in savings from some long-standing existing projects to earthquake relief.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has, consistent with past practice in similar disasters, offered Pakistan a concessional emergency loan of $375 million (or roughly one quarter of Pakistan's IMF quota); having successfully argued to the IMF it would not agree to Post-Program Monitoring by the Fund, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) must now decide if it wishes to draw on the loan.  The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has offered $252 million in earthquake support, but $200 million of that would be for import finance and lease finance at LIBOR or similar rates.  2.  (SBU) The World Bank and ADB have just launched a jointly coordinated reconstruction needs assessment in the affected areas, with the participation of the GOP and major donors, and results will be presented to the GOP on November 5.  That document will be the basis for a major Pakistan reconstruction conference scheduled in Islamabad for November 18, to which the GOP has reportedly already invited World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz and UNSYG Kofi Annan, who apparently has plans to be in the region at that time.   End Summary.  3.  (SBU) Comment:  It appears that the MDBs appreciate the magnitude of the reconstruction job ahead, though their current plans may need to be scaled up if the needs assessment reveals greater financing needs than anticipated. Given the compelling humanitarian need and the GOP's record of strong economic management over the past few years, MDBs think that obtaining their boards' approval for these plans shouldn't be difficult.  We are pleased to see that even if it is just a negotiating tactic, the GOP for now is holding a firm line, saying it does not want MDBs shifting resources away from existing projects designed to meet urgent development needs in social sectors and infrastructure.  End comment.  -------------------------------------- WORLD BANK:  IDENTIFYING $470 MILLION -------------------------------------- 4.  (SBU) John Wall, Country Director for Pakistan (protect), explained that the World Bank was looking at a near-term figure of roughly $470 million for reconstruction and rehabilitation.  This would be comprised of additional funds pumped into existing Bank projects in Pakistan, circumventing the need for the Bank's usually extensive review of new projects/designs, and facilitating the rapid disbursal of the new funds.  Two of these project expansions would be voted on SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  MDBS GEARING UP FOR at the Bank's October 25 board meeting: $50 million more for the Development Policy Credit for North West Frontier Province and $150 million more for the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (a nationwide program that, inter alia, funds provincial operations in Azad Jammu Kashmir since AJK is not officially counted as one of Pakistan's provinces).  The rationale for the infusion of new credit into these programs would be that since both programs were appraised and designed based on a three-year projection of provincial policies and expenditures, any significant change in those -- as the earthquake will certainly require for both AJK and NWFP -- will require adjustments of the projects' finances (so the provinces aren't forced to dislodge other necessary expenditures in order to meet their obligations under these two Bank projects).  The documentation for the expansion of these two projects was complete, and it was expected the Bank board would vote to support their expansion.  5.  (SBU) Bank staff would also on October 25 be bringing before the board - not for approval, since the necessary paperwork hasn't been completed, but to give the board a heads up that these projects will be ready for approval within a few weeks -  the expansion of several other existing Bank projects to include earthquake reconstruction:  $100 million more for the National Highways Project (although the highway project is designed to upgrade the main Karachi-Lahore artery, it would be expanded to cover three damaged roads connecting the quake-affected areas with central Pakistan where the main highway runs); $100 million more for the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (to expand the operations of the 61 partner NGOs currently working on microcredit, community infrastructure and capacity building, and mobilize them to rebuild communities); and $30-40 million more for the NWFP and AJK Community Infrastructure Project (to build out infrastructure including water, roads and schools).  In addition, Bank staff would preview for the Board roughly $30 million in undisbursed funds from existing projects that they hope to reprogram to support cash grants for livelihood support and housing reconstruction.  6.  (SBU) Subsequent to this initial package, after the World Bank/ADB joint needs assessment is completed in November, the Bank will consider whether it is necessary to fund an Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) for Pakistan.  ERCs were announced for India after the Gujarat earthquake and for Sri Lanka after the tsunami, worth several hundred million dollars, but those were funded out of undisbursed balances on Bank projects in those countries.  Since undisbursed balances on Bank projects in Pakistan totals only $30 million (see para 4), any funding for an ERC for Pakistan would have to come from new funds.  7.  (SBU) Wall said it wasn't clear to him if the Bank's plans would be announced at the Geneva conference on October 26, noting that strictly speaking the conference was about raising money for the United Nations' flash appeal for relief rather than for longer term reconstruction (this theme reappeared in discussions with most MDBs).  It wasn't even clear who from the Bank would be attending the Geneva conference, but not the Bank's President.  That said, Wall noted the timing of the October 25 Board meeting would allow the Bank to announce it had identified $470 million in reconstruction financing for Pakistan's reconstruction, and SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  MDBS GEARING UP FOR that the Bank's Board had already approved $200 million in expanded projected finance.  ----------------------------------------- ADB:  LIKELY TO OFFER $200-300 MILLION ----------------------------------------- 8.  (SBU) ADB's Ed Haugh (protect) said ADB was trying to identify earthquake reconstruction funds, since its three-year allocation for Pakistan was already settled and the GOP had made clear it didn't want any cannibalization of projects already in that three-year plan.  In view of that, the ADB was planning to come up with $200 million in new money -- $80 million in grant aid, and $120 million from the Asian Development Fund concessional resource (on IDA-equivalent terms).  Beyond that, the ABD was hoping to persuade the GOP to agree to identify savings of $100 million in some long-standing, lingering projects dating back to the early 1990's, and reprogram the money from those projects to earthquake assistance (but not cancel those projects). Longer term, the ADB was thinking of ways it could rejigger existing projects to meet reconstruction needs -- for example, the existing NWFP social sector project could shift its focus from programs to school reconstruction.  9.  (SBU) Asked how this compared to the kind of assistance ADB provided in response to the tsunami, Haugh explained that after the tsunami, the ADB took the unprecedented step of dipping into its own resources to fund a $600 million Tsunami Relief Fund.  The largest recipient, Indonesia, ended up receiving roughly $290 million from that Fund, so if the ADB were to announce $200-300 million for Pakistan earthquake relief, the amount would be roughly comparable.  Haugh mentioned the Tsunami Fund currently contained $30-40 million in unspent funds, which might be added to the Pakistan earthquake relief (aternatively, the fund might be re-designated the Asian Emergency Fund).  10.  (SBU) Haugh noted that while the size of contributions was important, both for reconstruction and for sending a political message of support, what was equally important was the effectiveness of the aid--specifically, that it materialize quickly, and be spent within a year or two. Gujarat earthquake aid had been effective in this regard, particularly because there was good local institutional capacity to build on for rapid disbursement; tsunami assistance had been less effective.  Cash grants -- for rubble clearance and for housing -- would be critical.  Haugh noted that NWFP, whose capital Peshawar was not seriously damaged by the earthquake, would be in a much better position to administer assistance than AJK, whose capital Muzaffarabad was one of the worst hit cities.  --------------------------------------------- IMF:  HAS OFFERED $375 MILLION EMERGENCY LOAN --------------------------------------------- 11.  (SBU) The IMF's ResRep Henri Lorie (protect) confirmed press reports that IMF Managing Director Rato had, on a brief October 17 visit to Pakistan, extended a $375 million emergency assistance loan, with a 3-5 year repayment term and 0.5 interest rate.  This amount would be roughly equivalent to 25 percent of Pakistan's IMF quota; extension of a Fund loan of this magnitude is fairly customary following major natural disasters (both Sri Lanka and the Maldives borrowed SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  MDBS GEARING UP FOR on these terms from the Fund after the tsunami, and Turkey did after its earthquake).  Lorie noted the GOP had been adamant with Rato it would not draw on such a loan if it would involve Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) (which had also been a sticking point when the GOP concluded its special IMF program in December 2004 -- and the Fund had relented). Rato had said given the generally sound state of Pakistan's macroeconomy, the Fund would not insist on PPM (Lorie noted this was a judgment call.  Since Pakistan is already borrowing close to 100 percent of its IMF quota, borrowing an additional 25 percent would push Pakistan's borrowing to the level where the Fund could insist on PPM, but given IMF confidence in the GOP's economic policy team, Rato did not think it necessary).   This exchange has already been reported in the Pakistani press, with Pakistan's refusal to accept PPM being characterized as a point of national honor (as was the "breaking of the begging bowl" associated with ending of the IMF program in 2005).  The GOP even asked the IMF for written confirmation of Rato's statement that the Fund would not insist on PPM--an odd request to make of the Fund Managing Director, Lorie noted, but one that would likely be addressed in Rato's letters to his GOP interlocutors thanking them for a productive visit.  This "victory" could give the GOP the cover it needs to draw on the IMF emergency loan.  12.  (SBU) Mechanically, Lorie said no further IMF action was necessary to offer the loan; all that remained was for the GOP to send in a letter formally requesting it.  (Note:  we understand such a loan would require IMF board approval.  End note.)  Therefore, Lorie noted, it was possible that the Fund might choose the occasion of the Geneva conference to officially confirm it has extended such a loan to Pakistan. But Lorie noted the U.N. conference on relief was not really a Fund function, and he was not even aware if an IMF representative would attend.  --------------------------------------------- --------- IDB:  HAS ANNOUNCED AID PACKAGE TOTALLING $252 MILLION --------------------------------------------- --------- 13.  During an October 23 meeting with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, IDB President Ahmad Mohammed Ali (accompanied by OIC SecGen Ekmeluddin Ihsanoglu) announced that IDB would provide $251.6 million to Pakistan as emergency assistance.  $1.6 million of that amount would be grant funding; $50 million as a Sharia interest-free loan (but up to a 1.25% service charge on actual expenses); $100 million would be lease finance (for such things as equipment purchases) with a rate of 3.825 percent, five-year grace period, and 25 year repayment term; and $100 million would be trade finance for the import of petroleum products, with a concessional rate of one year LIBOR (currently approx 4.4%) and 18 month repayment.  IDB Resident Rep Shahid Miah reported that IDB President Ali initially maxed out his individual authority by offering $11 million in emergency assistance and then approached the IDB Board.  The IDB Board, "in the spirit of Ramadan," expanded the package to $251.6 million.  When asked about the relatively high interest rates, Miah explained that while not competitive with other MDBs, they were lower than what IDB normally charges (approximately 5% for petroleum products and 5.1% for lease financing).  Miah also noted that OIC financing includes a preference for purchasing products from OIC countries, including in cases where lowest bids may be SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  MDBS GEARING UP FOR from non-OIC countries.  --------------------------------------------- --------------- NEXT STEPS:  PREPARING FOR NOVEMBER 18 DONORS CONFERENCE ON RECONSTRUCTION --------------------------------------------- --------------- 14.  (SBU) The MDBs and major donors have agreed on a needs assessment that will begin imminently.  Of the 15 functional areas the needs assessment will survey, the World Bank will take the lead on nine and the ADB will take the lead on six; GOP technical experts will participate in all the teams, and the project coordinators will meet on a weekly basis with de facto Finance Minister Salman Shah and Chairman of the new Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority LTG Zubair.  The assessment team will present its report to the GOP on November 5.  That will be followed by a November 18 Donors conference in Islamabad on reconstruction.   Prime Minister Aziz has already asked World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz to represent the Bank at that event, and has also invited Kofi Annan, who reportedly has plans to be in the region at that time.

Crocker, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  On October 25, Ambassador received USN VADM Stufflebeam, commander of the NATO team visiting Islamabad to coordinate NATO's earthquake relief deployment to Pakistan. VADM Stufflebeam told Ambassador that he would only be on the ground in Pakistan for the time necessary to conduct a Commander's assessment of the situation.  He said that NATO has authorized an initial 90-day Rapid Response Force deployment. NATO has already identified two hospital units that can be deployed in support of earthquake relief:  a Netherlands unit now in Afghanistan, but not currently being used by ISAF, and a Finnish unit.  VADM Stufflebeam reviewed the components of the NATO deployment, saying that Spain would take the lead on light engineering, France on aviation and Italy on maritime transport.  He said that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has suggested that NATO operate out of the Lahore air field.  He also noted that the UN has solicited a significant level of logistical support from the NATO mission.  2.  (C)  In response to VADM Stufflebeam's question, Ambassador discouraged locating the NATO operational center outside Islamabad, although it might make sense for NATO's air assets to work out of Lahore.  The Ambassador described the long time horizon for clearing many of the major roads in northern Pakistan, which the U.S. has only begun to fully appreciate as it prepares to deploy an engineering battalion to restore the Neelum Valley road.  He suggested that NATO take on a similar high-impact engineering project. Ambassador also alerted VADM Stufflebeam to Pakistani Army Aviation's need for MI-17 parts and maintenance support. Ambassador advised the NATO team to first become familiar with the Pakistan military operations and CENTCOM's Disaster Assistance Center - Pakistan (DAC-PAK) at Chaklala air field, then call on Federal Relief Coordinator MG Farooq to determine how NATO could support the GOP's operational priorities.  Noting that the proposed early deployment of two hospitals would get the NATO mission off to a great start, Ambassador underscored the importance of all donors staying on point that we are here to support the GOP and people of Pakistan through this crisis.  The Admiral concured. CROCKER

From October 22 to 23, a team of three Foreign Service nationals from USAID/Pakistan conducted an assessment in Muzaffarabad and several villages that were affected by the earthquake.  The team visited Muzaffarabad city, Shaeed Gali, Hasan Gali, Jabbi Haider Shah, Lamian Battian, and Gari Habibullah.  The team conducted assessments in the health, shelter, livelihoods, and education sectors.  End summary.  -------------------- Current Situation --------------------  2.  The team met with Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials, including the Chief of the Education, Planning, and Development Department and the Additional Home Secretary for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) to discuss the current situation.  The team learned that the earthquake destroyed the majority of GOP buildings in Muzaffarabad, including civil secretariat buildings, district government offices, and the judicial complex.  The remaining buildings that are still standing have not been inspected or cleared and cannot be used unless they are assessed or repaired.  The majority of school buildings (primary, secondary, high, and university) are destroyed or completely damaged.  3.  These GOP officials told the team that the GOP's Annual Development Plan (budget) is being reprioritized for earthquake relief.  The Asian Development Bank project has also been reprioritized for education.  U.N. liaison offices have been established in Muzaffarabad, but there is no AJK government-led coordination system in place.  4.  The USAID team reported that the GOP sent out teams for assessments in areas that are accessible.  The North West Frontier Province (NWFP) provincial government is establishing teams that are going house to house in affected areas giving vouchers to affected residents.  The villagers must come to a main office to receive relief supplies that are listed on the voucher.  The team reported that planning for relief activities must take into account the access restrictions of different affected areas: easy access by main roads; medium access by main roads/jeep-able tracks, short walking tracks; and remote/no access by roads.  For local transportation to villages from the city center, porters with donkeys and small jeeps are available.  Due to the difficulty of access to some villages, the GOP is trying to bring people from higher altitude, inaccessible areas to lower, accessible areas for the winter.  5.  The team met with residents in rural areas and most people are worried about shelter for the upcoming winter. Many residents in earthquake-affected areas are afraid to use structures that are partially damaged.  People are receiving emergency supplies, but not in adequate quantities and not in all locations.  People who are the least affected are receiving the most assistance as they are located closer to distribution points or are able-bodied.  6.  The team reported that buildings constructed using stone masonry were the most affected in terms of damage.  Most houses in rural areas use stone, wood, and soil (for roofs). Those residents who are more affluent use cement blocks for walls.  Some residents have already started clearing up space and are thinking of temporary shelter for winter.  In terms of shelter, tents are not the only option, and the team believes that using tin sheets as well as tarpaulin sheets on structures is an option.  The team noted that in Muzaffarabad, there are between 1,500 and 2,000 masons who could be trained to assist with reconstruction.  7.  The onset of winter is a problem as rains and snow in higher altitude villages will arrive soon.  However the team reports that major infrastructure damage occurred in areas that do not receive snow.  Many residents are sleeping outside in school spaces as the spaces around their houses are full of debris.  The team reported that residents seem eager to participate in a cash-for-work program for rebuilding damaged houses or rubble removal.  ----------------- Shelter ------------------  8.  Tents or temporary shelter are the major concern of all affected residents.  Most of the rural residents located in accessible villages, near roads, and in areas where snowfall is not heavy do not want to move away from their land.  Some have animals and stored food but no shelter and are sleeping outside.  9.  Other residents in rural areas have already started clearing space and are thinking about reconstruction but are constrained by lack of resources.  These residents have requested iron/tin sheets for roofs as they feel that even a tent will not be sufficient after snowfall, and they want to build a temporary room for the winter.  10.  The USAID/DART is working with USAID/Pakistan to re- establish schools using tents from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).  DOD Seabees are also engaged in large rubble removal and the USAID/DART is supporting cash-for-work activities for hand rubble removal and site preparation removal.  These emergency interventions will lay the groundwork for some of USAID/Pakistan's longer-term reconstruction initiatives.  ----------------- Livelihoods -----------------  11.  According to the team, most community members in affected areas, especially young men who were day laborers in various businesses, are out of jobs and need a source of income.  This is an immediate requirement as many adults and young people who worked in hotels, garages, transport, and daily labor are currently unemployed.  Some options for cash for work include debris removal, restoring sanitation facilities, and reconstruction activities.  12.  Women in rural areas assist in managing households, rearing cattle, collecting firewood, bringing water etc. They are dependent on men for the receipt of relief supplies.  Women who have lost husbands and have young children are now dependent on communities for support.  The team believes that creative ways can be used to get them involved in some sort of economic or reconstruction activity.  The team suggested that widows could be included as educators in tent schools as some surviving teachers may not be able to return to the schools due to injuries or migration.  Educated women may be able to be employed in health and education activities.  13.  Cash-for-work or commodities-for-work will be an important activity.  Cash alone might be an issue, as the cost of commodities rise.  Muzaffarabad has manpower and skilled labor for construction, but they will need training for quality construction in case new design or materials are introduced. In rural areas, immediate reconstruction of houses may be possible but not in urban areas. Removal of debris is an important issue in urban areas.  The GOP plans to build camps in accessible areas, and a center for orphaned children and widows is expected to be built in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur.  14.  The team also reported that Muzaffarabad has two other population groups, in addition to the majority of local residents.  There is a population of approximately 25,000 refugees from border areas of India and a similar number of migrant laborers.  These groups are recipients of relief assistance and will also provide labor for reconstruction and rehabilitation.  ------------------ Education -------------------  15.  The team reported that both the old and new campuses of the University of AJK were completely destroyed in Muzaffarabad.  There are some buildings on the new campus that are still standing, but they have cracks.  The buildings will have to be assessed by experts. It is estimated that 250 students died.  Eighty percent of the student population was from the neighboring districts of AJK.  16.  Almost all the degree and inter-colleges have also been severely damaged.  The reconstruction of the University of AJK is critical as this is the only university serving the region.  17.  Tent schools are an immediate requirement in rural areas and in some parts of the city to bring normalcy to the lives of children affected by the earthquake.  Almost 80 percent of schools have been damaged completely and require rubble removal for site clearance.  All community members agreed that it is important to re-establish schools and involve children in some constructive activity that will assist them in getting over the trauma of the earthquake.  --------------- Health ----------------  18.  According to the team, the buildings of the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), the largest tertiary care hospital, run by the Pakistani military through an agreement with the Government of AJK, have completely collapsed.  According to the Commanding Officer (CO) of the CMH, the earthquake killed approximately 80 percent of the hospital staff.  19.  The CMH was a 450-bed hospital with a staff of 350. Two-thirds of the staff was from the Pakistani military, and the rest were from the Government of AJK.  The hospital also had a large training institute for paramedics.  The team reported that all equipment has been destroyed, and medical assistance is being provided in the existing premises by the French Military Hospital Camp.  There were no facilities nearby to refer complicated cases, until the U.S. Mobile army surgical hospital (MASH) opened on October 25.  20.  The Department of Health in Muzaffarabad has effectively ceased to function as most staff are direct or indirect victims of the disaster and are not reporting for duty.  Medical and surgical field teams report 2,000 patients are being treated daily in Muzaffarabad.  The first three days after the earthquake, most patients were treated for trauma injuries. Currently, about 40 percent of patients are being treated for trauma, and the rest have acute respiratory infections.  21.  The team heard that approximately 50 people are being operated on each day at Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), which is designated as the principal hospital in Muzaffarabad.  The infrastructure at the Abbas hospital is intact, but it is not fully functional.  Surgical services have been re-established with four operation theaters for general and orthopedic surgeons.  The Pakistani military will transfer people and supplies to this hospital.  Abbas hospital has also established a vaccination service.  A dialysis unit is being set up in the next few days to prevent renal complications from crush injuries.  Three vaccination centers and mobile teams have been established in Muzaffarabad (in the central camp, stadium camp, and Neelum Stadium) to vaccinate people against measles and tetanus.  22.  According to statistics provided to the team by the Government of AJK, prior to the earthquake, there were 564 health facilities in AJK and NWFP, and the earthquake destroyed 291, partially damaged 74, and 199 health facilities are currently operational.

As of October 25, the death toll in Pakistan reached 53,000, and the total affected population was between 2.7 and 2.8 million people.  Shelter continues to be the primary need of those affected by the earthquake.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) continues to monitor the water and sanitation sector, and the construction of latrines recently increased. The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) reported no significant increase in the spread of communicable diseases. The GOP continues to work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish additional internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.  The U.N. camp management and protection clusters are concerned with the registration of IDPs in camps.  End summary.  ------- Shelter -------  2.  As of October 25, the total affected population was between 2.7 and 2.8 million people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Approximately 600,000 tents are needed to shelter a population of this size.  To date, the international community and the GOP have each delivered approximately 60,000 tents to affected populations.  With an estimated 180,000 additional tents in the consolidated pipeline, the total number of tents delivered and in the pipeline to date is 300,000.  3.  A shortfall of approximately 300,000 tents exists.  Of this number, OCHA estimates the need for quote shelter solutions end quote to be between 45,000 and 210,000. Approximately 220,000 to 1,000,000 people will likely not receive shelter assistance from the international relief effort.  4.  On October 25, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA) and the USAID/Pakistan Mission Director met with the GOP Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Task Force to discuss housing reconstruction.  Meeting participants discussed the importance of linking relief and reconstruction efforts through emphasis on transitional shelter, and the significant potential that shelter sector investments have for generating livelihoods.  5.  Also on October 25, the USAID/DART SSA, USAID Pakistan Mission Director, and USAID/DART Team Leader met with the GOP Relief Task Force to discuss tent supply and demand issues.  The USAID representatives cautioned that over- reliance on tents might preclude the GOP and international community from addressing other, more appropriate means of shelter.  The USAID/DART SSA provided meeting participants with details on other shelter interventions, including quote one dry room end quote and host/guest family support options.  6.  The USAID/DART Deputy Team Leader attended a meeting with OCHA and IOM on October 25.  Meeting participants noted that to date, hosting and spontaneous camps are accounting for much, if not most, of the accommodations of affected populations.  This trend will likely continue.  Water and sanitation problems are becoming hazards in spontaneous camps.  7.  Many NGOs providing shelter are focusing on rural communities and developing different toolkit models.  They acknowledge that they will not be able to provide large quantities of supplies in this short time period and are consequently working to develop alternate models of supplying winterized housing.  -------------------- Water and Sanitation --------------------  8.  On October 24, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), the research center of the Pakistan Ministry of Science and Technology, announced that the condition of drinking water in the earthquake-hit areas of Abbottabad and Mansehra in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is satisfactory, but the drinking water in Pakistani- administered Kashmir is not as good.  The PCRWR dispatched 10 field teams to Abbottabad, Mansehra, Balakot, Batagram, Rawlakot, Muzaffarabad, and Bagh to assess the drinking water situation.  These teams found that the condition of the drinking water in Pakistsani-administered Kashmir had deteriorated to a large extent.  9.  In Muzaffarabad, the PCRWR teams continue to monitor water resources, rehabilitation of water supply structures, and the installation of two filtration plans with a capacity of 48,000 liters of water per day.  Approximately 90 percent of the city's water mains are functioning.  Remaining leaks in the city's water mains will be repaired by next week.  10.  According to the USAID/ART FO, latrine construction in IDP settlements has increased with the arrival of plastic latrine slabs.  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)-Holland is initiating a concrete latrine slab reconstruction program.  ------ Health ------  11.  The USAID/DART FO reported that according to WHO, the vaccination campaign in Muzaffarabad is proceeding very well.  Having nearly completed vaccinations in the Muzaffarabad area, 19 two-person teams have expanded their operations to rural areas.  12.  The USAID/DART FO reported that Oxfam has established hygiene promotion committees in each IDP settlement. Islamic Relief has distributed 490 hygiene kits in settlements.  13.  According to the USAID/DART FO, WHO has reported no significant increase in communicable diseases in the earthquake-affected region.  After observing a slight increase in scabies in IDP settlements, WHO requested that hygiene promotion teams and clinical programs include scabies prevention in their hygiene promotion programs.  ------------------ Food and Nutrition ------------------  14.  A U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative reported that in the October 24 food cluster group meeting, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that in almost all of their camps, the Pakistani military has provided most of the food.  Participants in the October 24 U.N. food cluster meeting noted that Save the Children is feeding approximately 150 patients and staff in the Batagram field hospital.  Meeting participants agreed that obtaining shelter is a more pressing problem than obtaining clean drinking water.  --------- Logistics ---------  15.  A representative of the U.S. Embassy/Pakistan reported that in the October 24 U.N. general coordination meeting, the U.N. logistics cluster group discussed the need to create a rough plan for cargo distribution in affected areas.  The U.N. Joint Logistics Center (JLC) is the point of contact for air operations.  As such, the JLC is responsible for comparing requests by NGOs for air shipments to the priority needs list and validating requests.  The U.N. logistics cluster group will present its six-week operations plan at the October 27 coordination meeting.  At present, however, the JLC is not fully active in its role as the point of contact for air operations, and USAID/DART representatives continue to work at coordinating air operations.  16.  According to the JLC, in the past week, JLC staff deployed to the airport operation have more than doubled, aided by the seconding of two GOP liaison officers.  In the next week to ten days, the cargo-carrying capacity of the combined Pakistani and international rotary wing fleet deployed to the emergency is likely to double with the arrival of heavy lift military helicopters.  ---------------------- National Recovery Plan ----------------------  17.  The USAID/DART U.N. Liaison Officer (UNLO) reported that in the October 24 U.N. general coordination meeting, participants stated that President Pervez Musharraf will convene a National Recovery Plan conference on November 18 in Islamabad.  The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, joined by the G7, are the main partners in the development of this plan, under the direction of the GOP. In the first week of November, President Musharraf will receive a draft document of this plan.  ----------------- U.N. Flash Appeal -----------------  18.  In the October 25 U.N. coordination meeting, participants discussed the revision to the U.N. Flash Appeal, to be introduced on October 28 in Geneva.  The revised appeal will be for USD 500 million.  A major target in the revised appeal will be sustained helicopter operations during the winter months.  ------------------ Damage Assessments ------------------  19.  The USAID/DART UNLO reported that in a U.N. coordination meeting on October 25, participants stated that earthquake modeling has established three levels for use in damage estimates: high, medium, and low.  High impact areas include the cities of Shangla, Batagram, Lari, Balakot, Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Abbottabad, Bagh, Rawalakot, Kahuta, and Punch.  Medium impact areas include the cities of Bathela, Topi, Indus, Tarbela Dam, Haripur, Wah, and Islamabad.  Low impact areas include Risalpu, Kamra, Nowshera, Mardan, Indus, and Campellpore.  Meeting participants noted that route 25 from Islamabad to Muzaffarabad route 35 from Wah to Shangla are both open.  ----------------------------------------- IDP Movements, Camps, and Camp Management -----------------------------------------  20.  According to the USAID/DART FO, NGOs are reporting that IDP movement is limited because many of the roads in affected areas are closed.  At this point, it appears that people prefer to stay closer to their homes rather than migrate to cities.  The international community is concerned that if supplies do not reach the most vulnerable, this population will begin migrating in the coming weeks.  21.  At present, 19 unregistered IDP camps are located in Muzaffarabad.  Almustafa, a local NGO, is constructing new camps and working with the GOP to move IDPs in unregistered camps to the camps under construction.  In Thori Park, one of the new camps, this NGO plans to provide space and supporting infrastructure for at least 600 tents.  Numerous unresolved issues about security, water and sanitation, and other aspects of the camps characterize the plan for Thori Park.  UNHCR is satisfied with this camp, which will house up to 1,500 tents, and would like to set up additional camps with this NGO.  Many other NGOs, however, have expressed concerns with the camp setup, noting that mega camps are not the correct solution for this environment.  22.  According to the USAID/DART UNLO, participants in the October 25 U.N. coordination meeting reported that seven camps have been established in Mansehra and one in Muzaffarabad.  The UNHCR was absent from the meeting, and other meeting participants were unable to confirm the population present in each camp.  23.  The U.N. camp management and protection clusters are concerned with the registration of IDPs in camps.  UNHCR plans to register IDPs in the camps it is administering and is considering establishing registration for other camps.  -------- Children --------  24.  The international community has asked those who find unaccompanied children in earthquake-affected areas to contact the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediately.  If children (under the age of 18) in affected areas are transported to other areas, a relative should accompany the children when possible.  --------------------- USAID/DART Activities ---------------------  25.  The USAID/DART has requested 30,000 blankets for those affected by the earthquake.  The USAID/OFDA warehouse in Dubai will supply these blankets.  Pending aircraft availability, the blankets will be delivered to Islamabad October 30.  26.  Prior to October 24, the USAID/DART had facilitated the transport of 1,150 rolls of plastic sheeting.  On October 24, the USAID/DART facilitated the first of six additional transports of rolls of plastic sheeting.  On October 24 and October 25, two shipments containing a total of 1,660 rolls of plastic, or enough for 8,300 families, arrived in Islamabad.  The first shipment of 820 rolls of plastic sheeting went to GOAL for distribution, and ACTED will distribute the second shipment of 840 rolls.  On October 26, a USAID flight carrying 840 rolls of plastic sheeting, provided to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) for distribution, arrived in Islamabad.  The USAID/DART expects three additional flights containing plastic sheeting to arrive within the week.     CROCKER

As of October 25, the death toll in Pakistan reached 53,000, and the total affected population was between 2.7 and 2.8 million people.  Shelter continues to be the primary need of those affected by the earthquake.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) continues to monitor the water and sanitation sector, and the construction of latrines recently increased. The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) reported no significant increase in the spread of communicable diseases. The GOP continues to work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish additional internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.  The U.N. camp management and protection clusters are concerned with the registration of IDPs in camps.  End summary.  ------- Shelter -------  2.  As of October 25, the total affected population was between 2.7 and 2.8 million people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Approximately 600,000 tents are needed to shelter a population of this size.  To date, the international community and the GOP have each delivered approximately 60,000 tents to affected populations.  With an estimated 180,000 additional tents in the consolidated pipeline, the total number of tents delivered and in the pipeline to date is 300,000.  3.  A shortfall of approximately 300,000 tents exists.  Of this number, OCHA estimates the need for quote shelter solutions end quote to be between 45,000 and 210,000. Approximately 220,000 to 1,000,000 people will likely not BANGKOK FQ OFDA SENIOR REGIONAL ADVISOR TOM DOLAN receive shelter assistance from the international relief effort.  4.  On October 25, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA) and the USAID/Pakistan Mission Director met with the GOP Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Task Force to discuss housing reconstruction.  Meeting participants discussed the importance of linking relief and reconstruction efforts through emphasis on transitional shelter, and the significant potential that shelter sector investments have for generating livelihoods.  5.  Also on October 25, the USAID/DART SSA, USAID Pakistan Mission Director, and USAID/DART Team Leader met with the GOP Relief Task Force to discuss tent supply and demand issues.  The USAID representatives cautioned that over- reliance on tents might preclude the GOP and international community from addressing other, more appropriate means of shelter.  The USAID/DART SSA provided meeting participants with details on other shelter interventions, including quote one dry room end quote and host/guest family support options.  6.  The USAID/DART Deputy Team Leader attended a meeting with OCHA and IOM on October 25.  Meeting participants noted that to date, hosting and spontaneous camps are accounting for much, if not most, of the accommodations of affected populations.  This trend will likely continue.  Water and sanitation problems are becoming hazards in spontaneous camps.  7.  Many NGOs providing shelter are focusing on rural communities and developing different toolkit models.  They acknowledge that they will not be able to provide large quantities of supplies in this short time period and are consequently working to develop alternate models of supplying winterized housing.  -------------------- Water and Sanitation --------------------  8.  On October 24, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), the research center of the Pakistan Ministry of Science and Technology, announced that the condition of drinking water in the earthquake-hit areas of Abbottabad and Mansehra in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is satisfactory, but the drinking water in Pakistani- administered Kashmir is not as good.  The PCRWR dispatched 10 field teams to Abbottabad, Mansehra, Balakot, Batagram, Rawlakot, Muzaffarabad, and Bagh to assess the drinking water situation.  These teams found that the condition of the drinking water in Pakistsani-administered Kashmir had deteriorated to a large extent.  9.  In Muzaffarabad, the PCRWR teams continue to monitor water resources, rehabilitation of water supply structures, and the installation of two filtration plans with a capacity of 48,000 liters of water per day.  Approximately 90 percent of the city's water mains are functioning.  Remaining leaks in the city's water mains will be repaired by next week.  10.  According to the USAID/ART FO, latrine construction in IDP settlements has increased with the arrival of plastic latrine slabs.  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)-Holland is initiating a concrete latrine slab reconstruction program.  ------ Health ------  11.  The USAID/DART FO reported that according to WHO, the vaccination campaign in Muzaffarabad is proceeding very well.  Having nearly completed vaccinations in the Muzaffarabad area, 19 two-person teams have expanded their ANE DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINQRATOR MARK WARD operations to rural areas.  12.  The USAID/DART FO reported that Oxfam has established hygiene promotion committees in each IDP settlement. Islamic Relief has distributed 490 hygiene kits in settlements.  13.  According to the USAID/DART FO, WHO has reported no significant increase in communicable diseases in the earthquake-affected region.  After observing a slight increase in scabies in IDP settlements, WHO requested that hygiene promotion teams and clinical programs include scabies prevention in their hygiene promotion programs.  ------------------ Food and Nutrition ------------------  14.  A U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative reported that in the October 24 food cluster group meeting, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that in almost all of their camps, the Pakistani military has provided most of the food.  Participants in the October 24 U.N. food cluster meeting noted that Save the Children is feeding approximately 150 patients and staff in the Batagram field hospital.  Meeting participants agreed that obtaining shelter is a more pressing problem than obtaining clean drinking water.  --------- Logistics ---------  15.  A representQve of the U.S. Embassy/Pakistan reported that in the October 24 U.N. general coordination meeting, the U.N. logistics cluster group discussed the need to create a rough plan for cargo distribution in affected areas.  The U.N. Joint Logistics Center (JLC) is the point of contact for air operations.  As such, the JLC is responsible for comparing requests by NGOs for air shipments to the priority needs list and validating requests.  The U.N. logistics cluster group will present its six-week operations plan at the October 27 coordination meeting.  At present, however, the JLC is not fully active in its role as the point of contact for air operations, and USAID/DART representatives continue to work at coordinating air operations.  16.  According to the JLC, in the past week, JLC staff deployed to the airport operation have more than doubled, aided by the seconding of two GOP liaison officers.  In the next week to ten days, the cargo-carrying capacity of the combined Pakistani and international rotary wing fleet deployed to the emergency is likely to double with the arrival of heavy lift military helicopters.  ---------------------- National Recovery Plan ----------------------  17.  The USAID/DART U.N. Liaison Officer (UNLO) reported that in the October 24 U.N. general coordination meeting, participants stated that President Pervez Musharraf will convene a National Recovery Plan conference on November 18 in Islamabad.  The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, joined by the G7, are the main partners in the development of this plan, under the direction of the GOP. In the first week of November, President Musharraf will receive a draft document of this plan.  ----------------- U.N. Flash Appeal -----------------  18.  In the October 25 U.N. coordination meeting, participants discussed the revision to the U.N. Flash Appeal, to be introduced on October 28 in Geneva.  The revised appeal will be for USD 500 million.  A major target in the revised appeal will be sustained helicopter operations during the winter months.  ------------------ Damage Assessments ------------------  19.  The USAID/DART UNLO reported that in a U.N. coordination meeting on October 25, participants stated that earthquake modeling has established three levels for use in damage estimates: high, medium, and low.  High impact areas include the citiesQangla, Batagram, Lari, Balakot, Mansehra, Muzaffarabad, Abbottabad, Bagh, Rawalakot, Kahuta, and Punch.  Medium impact areas include the cities of Bathela, Topi, Indus, Tarbela Dam, Haripur, Wah, and Islamabad.  Low impact areas include Risalpu, Kamra, Nowshera, Mardan, Indus, and Campellpore.  Meeting participants noted that route 25 from Islamabad to Muzaffarabad route 35 from Wah to Shangla are both open.  ----------------------------------------- IDP Movements, Camps, and Camp Management -----------------------------------------  20.  According to the USAID/DART FO, NGOs are reporting that IDP movement is limited because many of the roads in affected areas are closed.  At this point, it appears that people prefer to stay closer to their homes rather than migrate to cities.  The international community is concerned that if supplies do not reach the most vulnerable, this population will begin migrating in the coming weeks.  21.  At present, 19 unregistered IDP camps are located in Muzaffarabad.  Almustafa, a local NGO, is constructing new camps and working with the GOP to move IDPs in unregistered camps to the camps under construction.  In Thori Park, one of the new camps, this NGO plans to provide space and supporting infrastructure for at least 600 tents.  Numerous unresolved issues about security, water and sanitation, and other aspects of the camps characterize the plan for Thori Park.  UNHCR is satisfied with this camp, which will house up to 1,500 tents, and would like to set up additional camps with this NGO.  Many other NGOs, however, have expressed concerns with the camp setup, noting that mega camps are not the correct solution for this environment.  22.  According to the USAID/DART UNLO, participants in the October 25 U.N. coordination meeting reported that seven camps have been established in Mansehra and one in Muzaffarabad.  The UNHCR was absent from the meeting, and other meeting participants were unable to confirm the population present in each camp.  23.  The U.N. camp management and protection clusters are concerned with the registration of IDPs in camps.  UNHCR plans to register IDPs in the camps it is administering and is considering establishing registration for other camps.  -------- Children --------  24.  The international community has asked those who find unaccompanied children in earthquake-affected areas to contact the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediately.  If children (under the age of 18) in affected areas are transported to other areas, a relative should accompany the children when possible.  --------------------- USAID/DART Activities ---------------------  25.  The USAID/DART has requested 30,000 blankets for those affected by the earthquake.  The USAID/OFDA warehouse in Dubai will supply these blankets.  Pending aircraft availability, the blankets will be delivered to Islamabad October 30.  26.  Prior to October 24, the USAID/DART had facilitated the transport of 1,150 rolls of plastic sheeting.  On October 24, the USAID/DART facilitated the first of six additional transports of rolls of plastic sheeting.  On October 24 and October 25, two shipments containing a total of 1,660 rolls of plastic, or enough for 8,300 families, arrived in Islamabad.  The first shipment of 820 rolls of plastic sheeting went to GOAL for distribution, and ACTED will distribute the second shipment of 840 rolls.  On October 26, a USAID flight carrying 840 rolls of plastic sheeting, provided to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) for distribution, arrived in Islamabad.  The USAID/DART expects three additional flights containing plastic sheeting to arrive within the week.     CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 016140  SIPDIS  DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/27/2015 TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, EAID, MASS, MCAP, MOPS, PGOV, PK, PREL, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  PARTS SHORTAGE MAY SOON GROUND PAKISTANI MI-17 RELIEF OPERATIONS  REF: A. ISLAMABAD 15861       B. STATE 196411  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  Summary and introduction:  Since October 8, Pakistan's Army Aviation has kept its fleet of heavy-lift MI-17 helicopters in the air flying daily sorties transporting relief supplies to areas devastated the South Asian earthquake.  To accomplish this dramatic shift in its mission, reourceful Army Aviation maintenance crews have turned to cannibalizing grounded MI-17s for parts after having quickly depleting their normal stockpiles of parts.  A shortage of replacement parts will increasingly impair Army Aviation support for earthquake relief operations, as helo sorties decline because aircraft must wait for maintenance (Ref A).  Post estimates that an infusion of USD 16 million is required to restore Pakistan's MI-17 fleet to a 70 percent availability level over the next six months.  End summary and introduction.  Pakistani Army Aviation Operations ---------------------------------- 2. (C)  Pakistan Army Aviation has 40 MI-17s, five of which had been seconded to other GOP agencies (Note:  The MI-17 that crashed on October 16 was one of these five.  End note.)  Information available to post's Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) and CENTCOM's Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) indicated that, as of October 26, ten (10) MI-17s have not been operational recently:  six (6) are being overhauled; one (1) would be uneconomical to repair; one (1) suffered crash damage and two (2) have been identified as excess defense articles and are being cannibalized for parts.  Of the remaining thirty MI-17s:  -- four (4) are out of the country supporting UN missions -- four (4) are out of service for phased maintenance -- two (2) are out of service for inspection -- one (1) is out of service because of a rotor strike -- one (1) is out of service because of a tail boom strike by the main rotor -- eighteen (18) are available for EQ relief operations*  *  Based on ODRP and DAC observations, post believes that true daily availability rate for Pak Army helos is closer to fourteen (14), as maintenance on each aircraft can take 1-2 days.  3. (C)  Pakistan Army Aviation had budgeted for 5000 flying hours for the fiscal year beginning June 30, 2005.  In the weeks since the October 8 earthquake, the MI-17 fleet has been flying at a dramatically accelerated operational tempo: Pakistan Army Aviation claims that it is flying an average of six (6) hours per operation aircraft per day.  At this rate, Army Aviation will burn through its flying hour allotment for the year in the next month.  The cost for 5000 hours of flying based on thirty (30) operational MI-17s is approximately USD 3 million.  Pakistan Army Aviation planners estimate that 15,000 MI-17 flying hours will be required to support earthquake relief through April, based on thirty (3) available MI-17s, the current rate of operation and the eventual withdrawal of USG and other donors' rotary wing assets.  The current budget to operate Pakistan's entire 380 ship aviation fleet is only USD 40 million.  4.  (C)  Pakistan Army Aviation is in danger of becoming Non-Mission Capable within a month; ODRP and DAC have already noted a significant degradation in available aircraft for daily sorties.  Although  Army Aviation Fleet Maintenance Chief BG Najeeb Tariq has requested additional funding for MI-17 parts and services, none has been forthcoming.  Army Aviation maintenance personnel have shared their concerns with ODRP and DAC regarding the availability of parts in the mid- to long-term, as they are quickly consuming available stocks.  (Note: Having ten MI-17s that are not operational has turned into a boon for the maintenance crews, which has been relying on stripping grounded aircraft for parts as a short-term panacea.  End notes.)  5.  (C)  ODRP and DAC estimate that USD 16 million would be necessary to bring Pakistan's MI-17 fleet to a sustained 70 percent availability rate:  -- Restoration of one MI-17 with major damage:  USD 1.2 million -- Restoration of two EDA MI-17s cannibalized for parts:  USD 1 million -- Operational costs - 15,000 flying hours for thirty MI-17s over six months:  USD 9 million -- Previously contracted overhaul of six MI-17s:  USD 4.8 million  6.  (C)  If Pakistani Army Aviation fails to maintain a 70 percent availability rate, post questions how the GOP will sustain relief operations throughout the winter.  Many roads in the disaster area will soon be cut off by snow and/or future landslides.  Army Aviation's heavy-lift MI-17 fleet is the only realistic mechanism for delivering supplies to earthquake survivors in isolated areas.    CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 016190  SIPDIS  STATE FOR SA AND EB DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2015 TAGS: AEMR, EAGR, EAID, ECIN, ECON, MASS, PGOV, PK, PREF, PREL, SENV, AESC, UN, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  UN TRYING TO GET UP TO SPEED  REF: ISLAMABAD 16140 AND PREVIOUS  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)  1. (C) SUMMARY:  Mission staff with direct interaction with the UN's earthquake relief effort - from the team leader for USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to emboffs attending UN sectoral cluster groups -- characterize the UN response thus far as "a day late and a dollar short," with improvements coming slowly.  Post gives UNICEF, the World Food Program (WFP), UNHCR, and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) relatively good marks, but the UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) and UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) have gotten more mixed reviews.  As the resident UN representative in Pakistan has no/no background in emergency relief operations, post believes that the UN should immediately appoint an experienced disaster relief coordinator to manage its humanitarian assistance programs in Pakistan. END SUMMARY  UN Helicopter Support ---------------------  2. (C) From the beginning of the relief effort following the October 8 earthquake, U.S. military planners have worked hand-in-glove with Government of Pakistan (GOP) civilian and military authorities, with U.S. helicopters flying relief supplies to affected areas shortly after the earthquake hit. In contrast, twenty days after the disaster, many have wondered what happened to the promised UN helicopters, despite well-publicized UN promises to provide significant additional airlift capacity unfulfilled.  UNHAS has offered twenty MI-8 and six or eight MI-26 helicopters, but DART is skeptical that UNHAS can fund so many aircraft, noting that one MI-26 costs $11,000/hour to operate, not including the cost of the fuel.  DART does credit UNHAS's newly-arrived coordinator (a former U.S. Air Force officer) with doing a good job setting up a joint air operations center that meshes well with existing operations led by Pakistan military and CENTCOM's Disaster Assistance Center-Pakistan (DAC).  The Embassy's Office of Defense Representative-Pakistan (ODRP) also noted that UNHAS is close to finalizing an agreement with the Pakistan Air Aviation to set up a forward operating base in Abbotabad.  Logistic Coordination ---------------------  3.  (C)  The UNJLC has been and continues to be slow in becoming operational; some staff believe that UNJLC should have helped get UN helicopters here faster.  The World Food Program (WFP) is working to maximize the use of existing helicopters by purchasing a fleet of 90 30-ton trucks and 100 10-ton trucks to transit supplies to areas accessible by road, in order to free up helicopters to supply the most isolated areas.  Nutrition, Health Care and Education ------------------------------------  4.  (C)  WFP deserves high marks for quickly opening its warehouses in Afghanistan and sending trucks with high energy biscuits to affected areas.  WFP has not updated its initial estimate of providing food for 1 million people; some experts believe the true figure is actually between 2 and 2.5 million.  WFP must also compile information on how many farmers are harvesting crops and planting new ones, which will determine how much food will be needed in the spring.  5.  (C)  On health care and education, the World Health Organization is doing a good job.  With Pakistan's already underdeveloped health system in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Pakistan-controlled Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) shattered by the earthquake, DART wonders whether the GOP will be able to meet enormous needs over the long term. DART has observed some disconnects, such as patients being evacuated from Muzaffarabad even though hospital space was still available there.  UNICEF appeared to be working well with the GOP to set up schools.  Shelter and Camp Management ----------------------------  6.  (U)  UNHCR, which leads the Camp Management cluster has spent $7.6 million from its reserves to fly in over 860 tons of relief supplies including 15,000 winterized  tents.  UNHCR has been working closely with the GOP to establish camps for earthquake survivors, but the difficult terrain in the areas directly affected by the earthquake has made siting camp locations difficult.  Of the sixty sites suggested by the GOP, UNHCR found that two-thirds did not meet UNHCR standards.  UNHCR is working in nine camps, with a potential capacity of over 30,000. UNHCR is also in the process of identifying the locations of the many informal, makeshift camps in the earthquake-affected area, lending a hand to organize and assist the larger ones.  UNHCR has offered technical assistance to the GOP for the camps the government proposes to establish in Islamabad and outside the area affected by the earthquake, but will not play a role in the management of these camps.  DART team members have noted that UNHCR/Geneva is still debating whether UNHCR (vice the International Organization for Migration) should assist internally-displaced persons; this debate could delay UNHCR actions.  Information Coordination ------------------------  7.  (U) DART appreciated OCHA's efforts to set up Humanitarian Information Centers (HICs), which provide good demographic, statistical, and mapping information.  One HIC is already running in Muzaffarabad, and two others slated for Mansehra and Bagh.  Hit-or-Miss Coordination with the GOP -------------------------------------  8.  (SBU) Continuing a pattern post flagged early in the crisis, no GOP representative attended the UN's October 27 Camp Management Cluster or Shelter Cluster meetings.  The government's failure to actively participate in this and other UN cluster group meetings has been a continuing source of frustration to the UN and its NGO partners, many of which do not have sufficient experience with the GOP bureaucracy to know how things get things done here.  Burning Through UN Funding --------------------------  9.  (C) With only one-third of the UN's original flash funded, DART noted that WFP is already $40 million in the red, UNICEF $29 million in the red and UNHAS was also deficit spending. Comment -------  10.  (C)  Comment:  At best, the UN's coordination on the ground has earned only middling marks three weeks into relief operations.  In many sectors, the UN has struggled to identify and establish effective working relationships with GOP contacts.  The UN's lackluster performance to date stems primarily from a deficit of emergency coordination expertise and leadership. Resident UN Representative Jan Vanderhoosle had only been in office a month before the October 8 earthquake, arriving in Pakistan after spending seven years at UNHQ in New York.  He has no/no emergency coordination experience.  Post believes that the U.S. must strongly push the UN to send an experienced expert in disaster coordination to lead the UN effort here.  One name mentioned with approval by the UK's Department for Internatioanl Development (and which post would endorse) is Kevin Kennedy. CROCKER

The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) reports that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) is increasingly open to non-tent shelter alternatives.  In Muzaffarabad, the U.N. Children,s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that it has met 80 to 90 percent of SPHERE standards for water.  The GOP has begun registering children in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).  The USAID/DART is assisting with the relief to development transition.  The USAID/DART continues to facilitate the arrival of plastic sheeting, and it recently transferred U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) tents to implementing partners, who will distribute them for use as medical clinics and classrooms.  At present, 22 USAID/DART representatives are in Pakistan.  End Summary.  ------- Shelter -------  2.  On October 25, the USAID/DART Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA) accompanied the USAID Mission Director to meetings with the GOP Relief and Reconstruction Task Forces and discussed a range of shelter sector issues and options other than tents, including transitional shelter and quote one warm dry room end quote options.  The USAID/DART SSA provided the GOP Relief Task Force Coordinator with a copy of the SPHERE project guidelines for humanitarian activities. This document offers insights on the humanitarian community,s activities, protocols, and outputs.  3.  In discussions between the USAID/DART SSA and the GOP Relief Task Force Coordinator (RTFC), it became clear that the GOP is increasingly open to non-tent shelter options. The RTFC provided a specific example of the Pakistani military deploying three battalions of engineers to the earthquake-affected areas to distribute corrugated metal sheeting and provide guidance on the construction of quote one warm dry room end quote. 4.  The USAID/DART SSA attended an October 27 shelter cluster group meeting in which the International Organization for Migration (IOM) discussed its new shelter strategy paper. IOM plans to organize a group with two or three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to meet with GOP representatives and discuss pressing shelter issues, including a shift from emphasis on providing tents to implementing other solutions such as shelters improvised from available materials, repair kits for homes, warm rooms, and host family grants.  -------------------- Water and Sanitation --------------------  5.  According to the USAID/DART Water and Sanitation Officer (WSO), UNICEF reported on October 27 that 90 percent of the IDP camps in Muzaffarabad have water tanks in place.  UNICEF is directly managing three water tanker trucks dedicated to delivering water to the Muzaffarabad camps.  UNICEF stated that their control over water delivery to camps will improve the reliability of this service.  UNICEF estimates that it has met 80 to 90 percent of SPHERE standards for water in camps in Muzaffarabad.  UNICEF aims to meet 100 percent of SPHERE standards in the coming days.  6.  The USAID/DART WSO reported that UNICEF intends to meet SPHERE latrine standards in all IDP camps in Muzaffarabad. UNICEF has completed 30 percent of the work necessary toward meeting SPHERE standards, and UNICEF plans to make major progress toward meeting this goal in the next two to three weeks.  The limiting factor in the construction of latrines is the availability of latrine slabs.  UNICEF is investigating and testing different construction techniques in order to increase slab construction.  --------- Logistics ---------  7.  On October 26, a U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative attended a U.N. logistics cluster group meeting.  The U.N. Joint Logistics Center (JLC) plans to have a presence at every logistics base.  Due to looting of CARE cargo in the absence of a CARE representative at the time of the cargo arrival, JLC now requires confirmation of cargo pickup before allowing helicopters with cargo to fly.  8.  At the U.N. logistics cluster group meeting, JLC reported having a productive meeting with GOP officials on October 25.  In this meeting, the GOP reviewed the JLC operational plan, and both parties declared a need for a joint logistical hub and operational center.  The chair of the October 25 meeting stressed the importance of cooperation among humanitarian groups, the Pakistani military, and the U.S. military.  ------------------------- Camps and Camp Management -------------------------  9.  A U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative who attended an October 27 camp management cluster group meeting reported that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is maintaining its focus on preventing population displacement. UNHCR is transporting tents and supplies to people near their destroyed homes, setting up camps at lower elevations that can be supplied by road during the winter, and identifying and helping to organize and supply the many informal camps.  10.  The U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative stated that UNHCR will not manage camps far from the earthquake-affected areas, but it has offered technical assistance to camps it will not manage.  At the request of the GOP, UNHCR will tour Fateh Jang and Chatwal, two sites in the Punjab District far from the area damaged by the earthquake.  The GOP has proposed this area be used as a site for camps for up to 300,000 people.  11.  Participants at the camp management cluster group noted that UNHCR and its partners, many of them local NGOs, are operating nine camps in earthquake-affected areas.  These camps have a total estimated capacity of 5,200 tents, each large enough for a family of 6 or 7.  As of October 27, 1,308 tents were in the camps, and the total population was 7,170 people.  NGOs are serving hot meals in some camps, but UNHCR expects this service will not last long.  12.  According to the U.S. Embassy/Pakistan representative, meeting participants noted that the GOP Interior Ministry's National Database and Registration Administration (NADRA) is registering earthquake victims who are in hospitals.  UNHCR plans to register IDPs in the camps it is administering and is considering registering IDPs in other camps as well.  ---------- Protection ----------  13.  According to reports from the USAID/DART FO, the GOP Office of Social Welfare (OSW) plans to register all children ) both accompanied and unaccompanied (orphan) ) in IDP camps.  However, the OSW lacks training on identifying unaccompanied children and needs assistance to deal with the long-term needs of such children.  14.  On October 27, the USAID/DART FO reported that the GOP has started registering children in the IDP camps in Muzaffarabad.  In one of the new IDP camps, the GOP registered 930 children and did not find any unaccompanied children.  UNICEF reports that it has child protection officers protecting unaccompanied or separated children in the hospitals.  The USAID/DART FO reported that the GOP Ministry of Social Services (MSS) is in need of assistance, as the MSS building and office equipment were destroyed, and 355 staff members are homeless. The MSS also urgently requires technical assistance to deal with the short- and long-term needs of unaccompanied children.  --------- Education ---------  15.  The USAID/DART FO reported that the GOP is encouraging the opening of schools, and UNICEF needs assistance setting up schools in newly registered IDP camps.  Both UNICEF and the GOP Ministry of Education welcome U.S. military assistance to clear debris from 20 priority school sites within affected areas.  Debris-clearing will begin on October 29.  ------------ Coordination ------------  16.  The U.S. military Liaison Officer (LNO) to the USAID/DART attended a U.N. general coordination meeting on October 27.  The LO reported that the GOP plans to move tent camps below the snow line.  Meeting participants stated that three storage facilities will be located at Abbottabad, and each will be capable of storing 400 tons of humanitarian supplies for NGO use.  17.  The USAID/DART Water and Sanitation Officer (WSO) reported that the U.N. Humanitarian Information Center (HIC) will place all its information on a common server at the U.N. compound.  Relief groups will be able to access this server using a wireless network that serves the compound.  18.  The USAID/DART is working with USAID/Pakistan to ensure a smooth transition from humanitarian relief programs, implemented in response to the earthquake, to USAID/Pakistan,s longer term development programs.  ----------------------------- Pakistani Military Activities -----------------------------  19.  According to local media reports, the Pakistani military set up three main reporting and information centers for the security and effective execution of relief, rescue, and rehabilitation operations in the earthquake-hit areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).  The Pakistani military set up these centers at Havelian, Mansehra, and Gari Habibullah, and military and civil police are jointly manning the centers.  The Pakistani military established 52 free public call offices to facilitate coordination of relief activities. -------------------------------- Relief to Development Transition --------------------------------  20.  The USAID Mission Director, USAID/DART Team Leader, and USAID/DART SSA attended an October 28 meeting of the GOP Federal Relief Cell.  In the meeting, the RTFC gave a detailed, multi-sectoral presentation on current GOP strategy for relief activities through March 2006.  Representatives of international organizations requested that the GOP create a joint strategic planning committee to provide further guidance on sectoral activities.  Following the meeting, the RTFC met with USAID/DART representatives and others and requested additional USG technical advice.  The initial meeting of the strategic planning committee will occur on October 30.  21.  The USAID/DART reported that in the October 28 meeting, representatives of international organizations discussed the pledges made at the recent Geneva conference on the South Asia Earthquake, and noted that the bulk of pledges was for reconstruction activities.  These representatives requested that the GOP emphasize the continued importance of funding relief activities in the near future.  --------------------- USAID/DART Activities ---------------------  22.  On October 27, the USAID/DART facilitated the arrival of 1,770 rolls of plastic sheeting, enough to provide shelter alternatives for 8,850 families.  The plastic sheeting was provided to Save the Children/US for distribution.  23.  The USAID/DART continues to facilitate the movement of excess U.S. military relief commodities.  On October 27, the USAID/DART transferred 29 tents to be used as clinics or hospital support facilities to WHO.  Also on October 27, the USAID/DART facilitated the movement of six tents to UNICEF to be used as classrooms.  24.  On October 28, the USAID/DART transferred 28 DOD tents to UNICEF that will be transported to Muzaffarabad for use as schools; 10 to Mansehra for use as schools; and 3 to Mansehra to be used for child protection purposes.  The USAID/DART also transferred tents to WHO.  WHO transferred 29 tents to Muzaffarabad and 8 tents to Mansehra, all of which WHO will use for medical facilities.  25.  The USAID/DART Economic and Livelihoods Officer (ELO) has been coordinating the initiation of the cash-for-work (CFW) program among international NGOs, local NGOs, and USAID/Pakistan.  USAID/DART coordination will lay the groundwork for a smooth transition between USAID/DART emergency relief activities to USAID/Pakistan rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  The USAID/DART plans to implement the CFW program in various earthquake-affected areas and will likely center the program on clearing rubble for the reconstruction or improvement of schools, shelter, and possibly hospitals.  The CFW program will inject cash into local economies and facilitate activities that will both prepare for reconstruction and provide locals with a sense of a return to normalcy.  26.  According to the USAID/DART ELO, the USAID/DART has held discussions with the U.S. military Seabees to facilitate the use of their heavy equipment in rubble clearance.  The USAID/DART reported that Seabees seem to be highly interested in joint activities.  Details about implementation are forthcoming.  27.  The USAID/DART ELO met with InterNews on October 28 to discuss information dissemination to earthquake-affected populations.  The USAID/DART ELO noted that earthquake-affected populations need humanitarian assistance as well as access to information, particularly regarding health, water and sanitation, winterized shelter and access to food and NFI.  The USAID/DART will continue to work to facilitate information sharing from relief agencies to affected populations.  ----------------- USAID/DART Status -----------------  28.  Currently, 22 USAID/DART representatives are in Pakistan, working to facilitate USG humanitarian assistance in response to the recent earthquake.  At present, a three-person USAID/DART team, comprising a communications officer, a field officer, and a protection officer, are based in Muzaffarabad.  The team is conducting follow-up assessments and coordinating relief activities with the U.N.  29.  On October 27, a USAID/DART field officer (FO) was deployed to Mansehra to set up a field office for the USAID/DART.  The USAID/DART FO is conducting assessments and coordinating humanitarian assistance.  The USAID/DART will be deploying additional team members to Mansehra in the coming days, including a water and sanitation officer who will travel to Mansehra on October 29. CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 016473  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/2015 TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, EAID, MASS, PGOV, PREL, PK, PAS, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: CHANGING PERCEPTIONS OF AMERICA   Classified By: DCM Patricia Butenis, derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1. (C) The isolation of many areas impacted by the October 8 earthquake has long afforded Islamist politicians and conservative religious clerics an uncritical audience for their at times extremist worldviews, in which America (or the West) as enemy of Islam featured prominently.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that prominent American and other Western assistance to earthquake victims is chipping away at the heretofore unquestioned acceptance of this worldview and may be isolating its proponents on the ground.  According to civil society contacts, the presence of international relief workers is uniformly welcomed in these areas.  Anti-American or anti-Western sentiment has largely been abandoned in the face of overwhelming need.  2. (SBU) Contacts report that a handful of extremist clergy have attempted to thwart this pervasive change in attitude towards outsiders.  In some villages, religious leaders have spoken against accepting aid from any source other than Islamic donors and have pressed GOP, military, and private Pakistani NGOs to refuse supplies donated by the West.  Their entreaties have been ignored.  Even the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent organization of designated foreign terrorist organziation Lashkar-e-Tayyaba) have gratefully accepted supplies for their relief camps from whatever the source.  A few stories of religious leaders going even further have emerged.  In one case, a local cleric railed against accepting American relief goods that had recently arrived in the village by U.S. military helicopter.  He then attempted to place himself between villagers and the much needed supplies.  NGO sources reported that his own followers removed him, thrashed him, and then began to distribute the supplies to appreciative villagers.  3. (C) During recent iftar dinners with civil society and NGO representatives, poloff inquired whether this change in attitude would endure after relief and reconstruction efforts cease.  The view on NWFP districts was mixed.  Some felt the assistance provided would be remembered, particularly if the USG actively engages in reconstruction of important community institutions like schools or health centers.  Others argued that cultural/religious traditions in this part of the NWFP mandated subservience to religious leaders.  Ignoring such leaders in a crisis was possible, but over the long term, clerics would reestablish their firm grip on public opinion. In Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK), all interlocuters believed that the changes were irreversible.  They attributed the clerics' hold on AJK to the area's isolation from the rest of Pakistan; the region's military sensitivity led the GOP to limit travel to AJK by foreigners and Pakistanis alike.  Due to the earthquake, the military had opened the floodgates to facilitate relief and reconstruction.  Shutting them again would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  4. (C) Comment:  The anecdotal evidence available suggests that public perception of the USG in the earthquake-impacted areas is changing for the better.  The endurance of this shift in public opinion will largely be determined by the durability of American engagement through the reconstruction phase and the success of such reconstruction in more firmly tying these previously isolated regions to Pakistan.

From October 30 to 31, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) Economic and Livelihoods Advisor (ELO), Program Officer (PO), Water and Sanitation Officer (WSO), Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA), Earthquake Expert (EE), Military Liaison Officer (MLO), Field Officer (FO), and U.S. Army Engineer conducted a multi-sectoral assessment in Batagram District to better understand conditions and the response of the donor community.  This cable summarizes the results of their assessment and analysis, and it provides recommendations for action.  ----------------- Batagram District -----------------  2.  In Batagram District, the USAID/DART performed building assessments in order to devise an effective earthquake mitigation strategy.  The USAID/DART EE and SSA observed that approximately 65 percent of the buildings are stone masonry, 15 percent are reinforced concrete frame, 15 percent are brick masonry, and 5 percent are other types, including adobe.  Nearly one hundred percent of the building stock is non-engineered, was built with poor quality materials, and demonstrates poor workmanship.  Most buildings are two to three stories, but some are four stories.  3.  According to the USAID/DART EE and SSA, buildings in Batagram District manifest a number of major deficiencies. In general, buildings lack integrity between structural elements; the wall-to-wall, wall-to-roof, and column-to-beam connections are not structurally sound.  Reinforcement detailing such as splicing, 90-degree bends in stirrups, large spacing of stirrups, and inadequate reinforcement bars in columns and beams, is a major problem.  Measures for improving earthquake resistance are basic and simple, and local masons, technicians, and engineers can learn such methods.  4.  The USAID/DART EE and SSA reported that some of the families affected in the Allai Valley have traveled to other settlements where they are temporarily living with relatives in a hosting arrangement.  Others have obtained shelter materials (primarily tents) and returned to upland villages, a small number have moved to informal camps, and some affected people have moved into a newly-established government of Pakistan (GOP) camp.  An unknown portion of those who remain will encounter difficulties obtaining adequate food during the winter.  It is uncertain whether camp size will increase as winter sets in.  In general, people prefer to stay near their homes, especially when their livestock and belongings remain in their home area.  5.  The USAID/DART EE, SSA, and WSO paid a visit to the Batagram office of the Sarhad Rural Support Program (SRSP). Following the earthquake, SRSP began implementing relief programming.  SRSP has established 42 tented villages in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), including seven tented villages in Batagram District.  SRSP has not yet erected a tented village in Allai Valley.  Each of SRSP's tented villages serves an average of 30 families.  To date, SRSP has served 9,000 people NWFP.  SRSP works with World Vision (WV), the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Mercy Corps. SRSP is distributing family kits, which include tents, blankets, a tarpaulin, utensils, and other supplies, provided by UNICEF.  SRSP/Batagram employs one engineer and six humanitarian aid workers.  ------ Jessul ------  6.  After the office visit, the SRSP staff joined the USAID/DART EE, SSA, and WSO on a visit to the tent village in Jessul, which SRSP has developed for 25 families.  The USAID/DART EE and SSA observed damaged houses and other building structures and met with people affected by the earthquake.  Affected people in Jessul stated that their first priority is finding a job and their second is repairing and rebuilding their houses.  Currently, the tents in Jessul are pitched in the upland agricultural land. People are using the same traditional water sources that they were using prior to the earthquake, and they are using drainage ditches next to fields for sanitation.  These practices, coupled with the small number of households occupying tents in the village, minimize the need for water and sanitation interventions.  Beginning in March, the affected population will need the land on which the tents are pitched for sowing crops.  Therefore, it is imperative to facilitate seismic-resistant construction training immediately to ensure that imminent repair and rebuilding activities do not reflect past building practices.  This could be achieved through a cash-for-training (CFT) program that would rapidly expand knowledge of seismic-resistance construction among local masons, carpenters, and building professionals.  7.  Cognizant of the need to commence with agricultural activities at the outset of spring, people are beginning to repair and rebuild their houses, to the extent possible, in hopes of beginning full reconstruction in the spring.  Those interviewed remarked that they were waiting for aftershocks to subside before beginning to rebuild their homes.  They expressed the hope that the GOP would help them reconstruct through loans, compensation, or other mechanisms.  They plan to begin repair activities in approximately two weeks.  ----- Mehra -----  8.  The USAID/DART MLO and the U.S. Army Engineer traveled with representatives from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to the Mehra site, approximately 40 kilometers (km) northwest of Batagram, on the banks of the Indus River and just off the Karakorum highway.  At this site, the GOP military proposes to build a tented camp to house 40,000 to 50,000 people.  The USAID/DART team observed very little earthquake-related damage along the Karakorum highway, with the exception of one small village, about half of which had slid down a slope.  Survivors from this village are living in tents in their fields along the river.  Road damage to Karakorum highway is minimal.  9.  At Mehra, the team spoke with the Pakistani colonel responsible for establishing the tented camp.  He stated that the GOP intends for people living at higher elevations to move to the camp, which is well below the snow line, before winter begins.  Although the slope of the tent site is not too steep, and the camp has access to water, the site is not large enough to meet Sphere Project Guidelines (SPG) for the projected population.  Currently, 1,000 people are at the site and are receiving support from local non- governmental organizations (NGOs).  The OCHA representative stated that up to 70 percent of the total local population of 140,000 to 190,000 people may move down from the mountains.  Representatives of local NGOs, however, believe that many of these people will likely stay with relatives or in other villages.  10.  GOP military representatives at Mehra told the USAID/DART that the GOP military has a few hundred tents but needs 6,000 to 7,000 tents for this tent city.  The GOP military plans to divide the camp into six to eight sectors, to correspond with existing villages, and proposes to build a helipad to facilitate movement of supplies to the camp. The OCHA representative stated that OCHA plans to remain closely involved in the planning process, providing the GOP military with advice and coordination with NGO partners as needed.  GOP military representatives at Mehra are aware of their knowledge gaps, and appear willing to work with OCHA on camp establishment and management.  ------------------------ Technical Considerations ------------------------  11.  The site for the proposed 40,000-person GOP camp near the Allai Valley is significantly smaller than SPG would suggest.  A 40,000-person camp requires 1.8 million square meters of space, whereas the current useable camp area may be less than 100,000 square meters, according to a representative of OCHA.  Many people leaving the valley are staying with family and friends, or they are obtaining shelter materials and then returning to upland villages. Others would remain in a lowland shelter of some kind only until aftershocks subside. [Comment. At this time, aftershocks continue.  End comment.]  Most people interviewed suggested that social and cultural concerns would undermine occupancy in a camp setting, indicating that people will probably not remain in the GOP camp through the winter.  12.  Many people suggested that as an alternative to tents, which people are willing to accept in lieu of alternative shelter options, they could utilize corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets and a small package of tools and household items in order to create a habitable space from salvaged building materials, and cover it with a solid, weatherproof roof.  Of note, all people interviewed preferred CGI sheets over tents, stating that they could re-use the CGI sheets as part of a more permanent shelter solution in the spring. This finding suggests the need for the design of transitional shelter packages featuring CGI sheets, which can bridge the gap between relief and reconstruction activities.  These packages could be supplemented with straightforward information on seismic-resistant construction measures that could be featured in the CFT program discussed above.  Such an effort would promote the broader objective of quote Building Back Better, Safer, and Faster end quote.  ----------------------------------- Save the Children Food Distribution -----------------------------------  13.  The USAID/DART FO and ELO visited a Save the Children (SC) distribution activity.  The distribution included sleeping bags, tents, and a one-week supply of food rations for one family.  Using effective local community organizers, SC distributed these baskets at a location approximately 45 minutes outside the town boundary.  The USAID/DART witnessed a well-organized distribution at which needy families, who were previously identified and provided with a coupon by local leaders, came to redeem the coupon for the relief package.  The USAID/DART heard reports that the recipients appreciated this orderly system, and the system allowed SC to systematically and efficiently cover their target area.  14.  This system of distribution gives SC strong relations with their beneficiaries and a solid network of capable leaders.  It therefore provides them with a solid platform on which they can carry out the rest of the USAID/OFDA grant in shelter, cash-for-work (CFW), education, and psychological and social work with youth.  SC proposes to carry out these activities in Batagram and in Bana village in the Allai valley.  Though SC is still in the beginning stages of implementation of this grant, the USAID/DART was impressed with the plans and preparations for the execution of grant activities.  ------------------------------------------- USAID/DART Meeting With OCHA Representative -------------------------------------------  15.  Upon the arrival of the USAID/DART, Edward Pearn of the OCHA Field Camp briefed the team.  On October 30, the U.N. had begun holding general donor coordination meetings, and recently the U.N. began holding health cluster meetings with the NGOs and other humanitarian relief agencies operating in Batagram District.  The USAID/DART attended the general donor coordination meeting and listened to progress reports from organizations working in various sectors, including organizations involved in the camp initiated by the GOP military at Mehra.  16.  [Comment:  Regarding U.N. coordination efforts, the USAID/DART noted that nearly one month after the earthquake, the U.N. is just beginning to coordinate relief efforts in this area.  At present, only three U.N. representatives work in this camp.  In addition, local and international NGOs have stated that establishing camps as proposed by the GOP may not be the best approach to address the shelter crisis for those in the Allai valley who reportedly prefer to stay in their home areas.  Many international agencies recognize that the establishment of centralized camps should be used as a back-up to other shelter options.  In summary, to date, the U.N. has not effectively carried out its responsibility of coordinating the relief efforts, and the U.N. may be supporting a potentially ineffective shelter solution.  End comment.]  ------------------------------- Conclusions and Recommendations -------------------------------  17.  Based on its assessment, the USAID/DART concluded the following:  -- The U.N. is slow in starting its task of coordinating relief activities in Batagram District.  -- SC appears to be doing well distributing commodities provided by the U.S. military.  SC appears to be on track for effective implementation of its USAID/OFDA grant.  -- NGOs question the priority of establishing temporary camps.  -- The camp proposed at Mehra could not house as large a population as proposed and comply with SPG.  The tent village at Jessul that was spontaneously established does not currently comply with SPG, although there are no major water and sanitation problems now.  18.  Based on its conclusions, the USAID/DART recommends the following:  -- CFW and CFT programs should be implemented in villages similar to Jessul.  Villages like Jessul are ideal settings for these types of programs.  -- Under the umbrella management of local organizations such as Rural Support Program Network (RSPN), SRSP would be an effective implementing partner for CFW or CFT programs and shelter activities.  -- Relief programs should address the need to enhance the knowledge and capacity of those engaged in construction of earthquake-resistant structures.  This type of program should begin immediately, as people are attempting to repair and rebuild houses.  -- As a complement to CFT programs to build capacity to engage in seismic-resistant construction practices, USAID- funded programs should raise earthquake awareness among the general population through public information campaigns.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 016480  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT PASS TO USAID  E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2015 TAGS: EAID, MARR, MASS, PNAT, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE: WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE'RE GOING  1.  (U) Summary.  As we approach the one-month anniversary of the earthquake, post offers this overview of relief efforts to date and an assessment of key priorities for the future. The earthquake itself caused much more damage and loss of life than initially estimated, but the Pakistani and international response has generally been strong -- with the United States leading in most categories of assistance.  The humanitarian relief phase of the assistance effort began with clearing operations and the delivery of search and rescue teams, medical aid, food and shelter.  This phase is continuing with a heavy focus on preparation for harsh winter conditions and it will last at least until winter begins to subside at the end of March.  (We expect the November 19 donors conference will set the agenda for the reconstruction phase of the donor response.)  In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the U.S. and international donors have focused on airlifting urgently needed supplies and equipment into the theater and onward by helicopter into the affected areas.  The need for air shipments into Pakistan will continue as we prepare for the onset of winter, but the need will diminish over time as NGOs and international organizations find more sustainable sources locally and in the region. The need for helicopter lift into quake-hit regions will continue at least through the winter.  End Summary.  Earthquake Response to Date ---------------------------  2.  (U) As more reliable numbers begin to emerge, the full impact of the 7.6 magnitude earthquake and the level of international response are becoming clear.  The GOP is now reporting 73,000 dead and 69,000 injured.  Press reports suggest that in some areas men are virtually the only survivors, as women and children were predominantly in homes or schools that collapsed. An estimated 2.8 million Pakistanis require shelter assistance.  The humanitarian response to the earthquake is a work in progress, but has for the most part been timely and effective.  The Pakistani military response has been especially impressive, and the GOP response structures have begun to coalesce.  Personnel on the ground are learning fast.  3.  (U) The United States has been quick to respond and has played a very significant and visible role in earthquake recovery.  Six Navy ships have delivered 115 pieces of heavy equipment and 158 tons of humanitarian relief supplies from US, Egyptian, and Gulf State donations.  The USAF has run well over a hundred airlifts into Pakistan.  The US Army, Navy, and NAS have flown over 1,500 helicopter sorties into the north delivering more than 4.3 million pounds of goods. Thirty one U.S., and US funded, helicopters are flying relief missions.   Of the roughly 8,900 tons of relief supplies received by Pakistan by November 3, the U.S. accounts for some 4,100 tons (46 percent), dwarfing any other single donor.  US helicopters have delivered over 2,100 tons of relief supplies; the closest runner up among donors is the UK, with 182 tons (8 percent of the US total).  Even Pakistan (at 496 tons) has delivered less than a quarter of the U.S. total.  4. (U) USAID has committed $41.8 million, with the focus on shelter, water and sanitation and other relief supplies. Military humanitarian assistance is at least $60 million thus far.  DoD has 933 deployed personnel to provide relief and reconstruction assistance and has established a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in Muzaffarabad.  To date, almost 600 patients have been served, including 46 surgeries.  By 7 November a U.S. Marine field hospital will be open in Mansehra.  The Embassy has established and staffed Forward Operating Bases in Muzaffarabad and Mansehra to help coordinate USG aid and assist Pakistani Authorities.  Get Them Through The Winter ---------------------------  5.  (U) The strategic objective of the current relief phase is to get the population of the affected area through the winter, until the end of March.  The key needs include shelter, blankets, food and medical supplies.  6.  (U) Shelter: We estimate that 400,000 households will require some form of shelter assistance and at least 10,000 large tents will be needed to house clinics, schoolrooms, offices and the like.  The GOP maintains that a combination of donor contributions, existing supplies and intensive domestic production will generate 500,000 tents by the end of November.  Assuming the GOP is correct and that the domestically manufactured tents are adequate, the unmet need will be for the larger tents, plus plastic sheeting to upgrade family tents as necessary.  However, we also expect that at least 60 percent of families will choose to stay at or near their existing (destroyed) homes, so the tents will need to be augmented by selected building materials to enable families to self-engineer a "warm dry room" during the winter.  These materials include plastic sheeting, corrugated metal roofs and stoves, fuel and household goods.  7.  (U) Blankets: The GOP hopes to provide two blankets per person for an affected population numbering an estimated 3.3 million (i.e., 6.6 million blankets).  Some 3.8 million blankets have been provided to date, leaving a gap of 2.8 million.  8.  (U) Food:  While there is not an immediate acute need for food, orders must be placed soon in order to ensure adequate supplies for the winter, particularly if a large population of refugees moves into the camps being established by the GOP.  The World Food Program estimates the food need at 720,000 metric tons, enough to feed 2.8 million people for 6 months.  As a net food importer, Pakistan will not be able to meet this incremental food need via domestic production; much of it will have to be shipped in.  9.  (U) Other Supplies: Roughly 65 percent of the health infrastructure in the affected area has been destroyed.  Over the longer term, this infrastructure will have to be reconstructed, but there is an immediate need to replenish stocks of antibiotics and other drugs.  We will be ordering up to ten health kits (that can serve up to 10,000 people each for three months).  Other needed supplies include family hygiene kits, tool kits and cooking kits.  An Evolving Relief Effort -------------------------  10.  (U) The initial emergency phase of this humanitarian relief effort has required rapid delivery of supplies and, in many cases, direct execution of relief operations by U.S. and Pakistani military elements.  This emergency phase will last for at least another two weeks as we prepare for the onset of winter.  During this period, U.S. military airlift capacity will be urgently required for delivery to Pakistan of shelter materials, blankets, food and other supplies identified in paras 5-9. Over time, however, there will be a natural transition toward more cost effective and efficient sea-lift transport and delivery mechanisms as partner NGOs develop local sources for these goods.  Despite daily improvement in some road networks, medium helicopter lift will remain essential through the winter to deliver supplies from depots in Islamabad and elsewhere to remote areas in the north isolated by massive land-slides.  Comment -------  11.  (C) The quantity and timeliness of U.S. assistance is beginning to pay measurable dividends in terms of local perceptions of the United States in general and the U.S. military in particular.  English and Urdu press regularly carry pictures of U.S. helicopters and relief supplies as well as articles that credit the U.S. for its response.  In our judgment, U.S. actions have already had a measurable impact on perceptions among Pakistani Kashmiris and within the Pakistani military (most of whom have never had sustained contact with the U.S. military).  In view of what we have already invested, and the positive impact it has had, we will need to be careful as we approach the transition toward a more sustainable USG relief effort. It is essential that Pakistanis not see this transition as a lessening of U.S. commitment and we should seek to preserve the positive visibility our military has received.  12.  (C) U.S. military assets -- including helicopter lift and medical units -- will continue to be needed in some amount through the winter for essential humanitarian reasons. We should also begin to consider whether there are aspects of the reconstruction phase the U.S. military could usefully participate in. The positive and benign aspect of the US military on display in Pakistan and throughout the region may offer a strategic opportunity for continued humanitarian activity as a major premise of military engagement over the next two years.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 016553  SIPDIS  DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL -- PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, MASS, MOPS, PGOV, PK, PTER, ECON, PREF, ASEC, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  A VISIT TO BATTGRAM   1.  (C)  Forward Operating Base Mansehra Officer-in-Charge and Econoffs visited Battgram district on November 5. Settlement patterns have complicated relief as damage is spread across mountain villages with low population densities.  Interlocutors were concerned for villages in the Allai tehsil, many of which have been established at high elevations and would become isolated by winter snow beginning in 15 to 20 days.  The Pakistan military is encouraging the relocation of these villages to a relief camp established at Meira on November 2.  Military officials aim to resettle 40,000 to 50,000 people. Around 2500 have arrived with approximately 50 families (average size of 8-10 people) coming to the camp daily.  Uncertainty persists as to the number who will eventually resettle in Meira, as many may choose to remain in their mountain villages.

Settlement patterns have complicated relief as damage is spread across mountain villages with low population densities.  Interlocutors were concerned for villages in the Allai tehsil, many of which have been established at high elevations and would become isolated by winter snow beginning in 15 to 20 days.  The Pakistan military is encouraging the relocation of these villages to a relief camp established at Meira on November 2.  Military officials aim to resettle 40,000 to 50,000 people. Around 2500 have arrived with approximately 50 families (average size of 8-10 people) coming to the camp daily.  Uncertainty persists as to the number who will eventually resettle in Meira, as many may choose to remain in their mountain villages.

Due to the enormity and complexity of this emergency and the major focus on providing shelter to villages in the mountains, it has been extremely difficult to monitor relief distributions in order to ensure that vulnerable populations, including those without effective male protection, are identified and receive adequate assistance. In the urban areas, especially in Muzaffarabad city, one month after the earthquake there has not been a registration of vulnerable populations and a prioritization of needs. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the lead in camp management under the cluster system, does not have enough presence on the ground in order to manage the camps. However, the numbers of unaccompanied children are extremely low and the government is working with the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) to register children in order to assess their needs.  The international community is still trying to meet the population's basic needs such as shelter, but much more needs to be done to identify and provide assistance to extremely vulnerable populations such as women-headed households and children at risk.  End summary.  ----------------- Current Situation -----------------  -- Relief Distributions  2.  The emergency relief operations are extremely complicated given the mountainous terrain and lack of information about population movements.  The provision of a safe, warm place to live is the first line of protection for vulnerable populations as winter approaches.  To date, the bulk of the relief operations have centered on providing shelter for people remaining close to their homes in the mountains.  However, in order to get these provisions to the population, the relief community has had to rely on the government of Pakistan (GOP) military, air drops, and relief agencies trekking or airlifting supplies to the mountain villages.  3.  Women in Pakistan are severely disadvantaged and discriminated against, and many fear that the current relief distribution only reinforces this situation.  The issue of ensuring that vulnerable groups receive adequate supplies is extremely difficult to monitor given the logistical difficulties of this operation and the lack of information about vulnerable populations.  Partner organizations asked about this issue have replied that they must rely on the villages to distribute supplies fairly.  One partner organization reported that they sent teams to villages to identify the most needy and vulnerable families.  These families were given tokens to take to a distribution site the following day.  The following day only men attended the distribution site, and there was no follow-up to determine whether the neediest families received the supplies.  Women reportedly received tokens, but no women claimed the relief supplies for which these tokens were issued.  Because there was no monitoring, it is unclear whether the women who received tokens were able to access the aid for which the tokens were issued.  4.  In urban areas there are many reports that women without effective male protection are made to sit in tents at GOP or GOP military sites while relief supplies are distributed to males first, leaving what is left for unaccompanied women. In most distribution sites, only men are visible standing in lines.  In addition, the USAID/DART has received many reports that women are being left behind in the villages to tend to what is left of their property and livestock while the men and the children come down to the valleys and urban areas to receive aid.  Some of the men who have come down to the valleys to receive aid report that there are women- headed households that are still in the mountains that may not be able to travel with their families.  5.  Some organizations are trying to ensure that families that do not have effective male protection or vulnerable families that have taken in separated children are receiving adequate relief supplies.  These organizations do state that they could be doing more to ensure that such families are identified and receive adequate relief supplies.  Some report that the first wave of relief distribution was so overwhelming that they simply have not asked the questions about vulnerability and that systems are not set up to ensure that these cases are being identified and addressed. Setting up these systems will require more resources so that the GOP military and individuals involved in the distribution are trained and sensitized to this issue.  More female workers are needed to distribute relief supplies to vulnerable populations.  Additionally, work needs to be done with communities so that communities ensure that vulnerable families, especially those without effective adult male protection, are receiving adequate relief supplies both in the mountains and the urban areas.  -- Camp Management in NWFP and AJK  6.  With the push to get shelter supplies to the mountain areas there has been less attention focused on camp management and services in the valleys and urban areas.  In the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the GOP is pushing to establish large IDP camps.   In Azzad Jamu and Kashmir (AJK), the government's policy on establishing IDP camps is unclear.  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has the lead in the U.N. cluster system for camp management, but UNHCR staff on the ground have stated that it does not have sufficient resources, staff, mandate, or leverage to manage the camps.  UNHCR only has a minimal presence of international staff on the ground.  7.  In NWFP, UNHCR stated that the GOP military is doing a good job trying to set up the camps, but the major difficulty is finding sufficient land on which to build the camps and organizations to provide services to the camps. The GOP military reported that it cannot take care of a large number of people in camps and is looking for serious help from the international organizations.  The government in NWFP is trying to set up large camps, because it believes that many people will migrate down to the valleys in the coming weeks.  UNHCR does not believe that there will be a massive migration from the Allai Valley and therefore does not want to put its resources into establishing large camps. UNHCR is providing the military with 18,000 tents and a very general site plan for the camps, and it is identifying the gaps in non-governmental organization (NGO) assistance in the camps.  UNHCR stated that it will only provide assistance for six months and that it does not have the ability to provide assistance to the GOP if there is a massive movement to camps.  8.  In NWFP the GOP military is trying to get the government to take over the responsibility of managing the camps. UNHCR reported that it believes the biggest issue is the unregistered spontaneous camps.  UNHCR is not concerned with individuals camping near their homes in a few tents or less; however, it is extremely concerned over the spontaneous camps.  These camps are being sponsored by political parties or religious organizations.  The conditions in these camps are unacceptable due to lack of sanitation facilities. UNHCR has advised the GOP to zone the area and give specific zones to NGOs to monitor and deliver services to the spontaneous camps.  The GOP should then decide on which camps should be moved into larger camps and develop a long- term plan.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported when they went into these spontaneous camps they found vulnerable families such as women headed households that needed assistance.  At this time there has not been a registration of these spontaneous camps in either NWFP or AJK.  9.  In Muzaffarabad city there are many spontaneous unregistered camps, and to date the GOP has only sanctioned two camps run by local NGOs.  The GOP has not stated its policy with regard to establishing IDP camps in Muzaffarabad, and the military in AJK does not have the same resources to manage the camps as in NWFP.  There are many gaps in the camp services, but water and sanitation is the biggest problem at this time, and security is also a problem.  USAID is coordinating with the U.S. military to build hundreds of latrines for these camps, and other NGOs such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Islamic Relief and Oxfam are also building latrines for the camps.  At this time, UNHCR does not have the resources on the ground to effectively manage the camps.  This problem is compounded by the fact that there are few international NGOs on the ground in Muzaffarabad city providing services.  It is clear that additional assistance is needed in order to provide basic services for the population of the registered camps as well as the spontaneous camps.  In camps that USAID visited, people are still lacking basic necessities such as shelter. In addition, the GOP needs to decide which camps it will close and which camps it will allow to remain open so that basic services can be provided that meet international standards.  10.  No international organization is taking the lead monitoring the movement of people.   For example, in AJK there is no agency monitoring the movement of the population or any agency receiving individuals when they arrive in Muzaffarabad to provide basic information on emergency relief.  Organizations do not want to draw people to urban areas, but people are wandering the city looking for shelter, tents and supplies.  People do not have access to an ongoing reliable flow of information of where they can access emergency relief.  -- Health  11.  The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that as many as 60 to 80 percent of the basic health centers and other health care facilities were destroyed in the earthquake-affected areas.  One of the biggest protection issues facing women is the lack of female doctors and nurses.  Some Pakistani doctors report that women have died because they could not be examined by male doctors.  The lack of female health care workers is severely limiting female patients' access to health care. WHO and other health agencies report that more female doctors and nurses are urgently needed in the earthquake-affected areas.  -- Child Protection  12.  The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) is the lead on protection activities for the protection cluster.  The GOP imposed a national ban on the adoption of children for a period of six months.  Islamabad has also restricted the relocation of children from quake-affected areas to prevent the abuse and trafficking of children affected by the earthquake.  UNICEF, together with the Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW), has begun registering all children currently living in emergency settlements across quake-hit areas of Pakistan and AJK.  The GOP wants to have some sort of statistics of affected children including those unaccompanied, with specifications regarding their age and gender groups to facilitate future planning.  In a joint effort with the ICRC, the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA), and several other national and international NGOs, MoSW intends to devise a comprehensive strategy to deal with the problems of orphaned, unattended, separated, injured and missing children.  Organizations are concerned that the MoSW is setting up institutions in other cities such as Peshawar that will care for unaccompanied women, children and separated children with vulnerable families.  13.  In conjunction with MoSW, ICRC is identifying unaccompanied children and tracing their families.  There are very few reports of unaccompanied children by ICRC, UNICEF and NGOs, and there are only a few unconfirmed reports of attempted kidnapping.  It is clear that the MoSW will need a great deal of technical assistance and support in providing care and services for unaccompanied children, separated children with vulnerable families, women-headed households with children, and child-headed households.  This is extremely critical in AJK where the government's infrastructure was severely damaged and many government workers were killed or lost their homes and other family members.  International organizations and NGOs will have to advocate for establishing good practices in the area of child protection and monitor the work of the government.  -------------------------- Response of USAID Partners --------------------------  14.  The provision of a safe, warm place to live is the first line of protection for vulnerable populations.  IOM, Save the Children (SC), ACTED, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the International Refugee Committee (IRC), and GOAL are providing winterized tents, shelter kits, blankets and other materials for rebuilding.  In addition, many partners are starting to focus on doing more to identify vulnerable families such as female-headed households and ensuring that they receive adequate assistance.  15.  In the registered and spontaneous camps, water and sanitation are critical needs, and many of USAID's partners are working to establish water supplies and latrines.  In Muzaffarabad, USAID is working with the U.S. military to build latrines in camps where latrines have not been built. In camps where latrines are being built, USAID's partners are working to ensure that women have safe access to these facilities.  16.  Credible reports from organizations including UNICEF cite fliers and other information about religious madrassas opening up.  It is critical that the schools are opened quickly not only to counter madrassas but also to try and bring normalcy back to children's lives.  In Muzaffarabad, USAID has worked closely with UNICEF and the U.S. military to coordinate the removal of rubble from school sites and set up tent schools as quickly as possible.  USAID and UNICEF have worked closely with the Ministry of Education to identify school sites, including girls' schools, for rubble removal and tent distribution.  USAID is also establishing cash-for-work (CFW) programs in Muzaffarabad to remove rubble from additional school sites.  USAID partners are establishing school-in-a-box programs and will be addressing psychological and social needs.  17.  International NGOs such as SC, World Vision (WV), and IRC have set up Child-Friendly Centers.  These centers are set up to support play and educational opportunities.  These organizations are reporting that vulnerable families are identifying themselves.  Additional programming needs to be established to help identify these vulnerable families without effective male protection, vulnerable families with separated children, and children-headed households. However, organizations are struggling to provide additional resources to these families.  With USAID assistance, WHO has established permanent teams to provide mental health assistance in the region.  ------------------------------------------- Gaps, Additional Needs, and Recommendations -------------------------------------------  18.  The first wave of relief distribution was so overwhelming that many organizations simply have not asked the questions about vulnerable families focusing on women and children.  Adequate systems are not set up to ensure that these cases are being identified and addressed.   These systems will require more resources so that the GOP military and individuals involved in the distribution of relief commodities are trained and sensitized to identifying vulnerable families and ensure that they receive relief supplies.  In addition, more female workers are needed to distribute relief supplies to vulnerable populations and address health care issues for female patients.  Work needs to be done with communities so that they ensure vulnerable families, especially those without effective adult male protection, are receiving adequate relief supplies both in the mountains and the urban areas.  19.  A registration and prioritization system must be created for vulnerable women and children in the urban areas.  UNICEF and the GOP are registering children, but the purpose of this registration is unclear.  In addition, it will take a considerable time to register all children in the quake-affected areas.  Once identified, these groups must have access to relief supplies, psychological and social help, and other resources.  20.  UNHCR stated that they will only provide limited assistance for six months and that they do not have the ability to provide assistance to the GOP if there is a massive movement to camps.   The GOP and military have better control over the situation in NWFP than in AJK. While there is more control, information, and planning with the registered camps in NWFP, there is still a critical need for additional services in the camps, including latrines and security.  In AJK, the information concerning which spontaneous camps will be kept open and where additional camps will be built is extremely confusing.  To date in Muzaffarabad city, the government has only designated two camp sites.  There are still significant needs in these two camps for basic services.  However, the water and sanitation issues are finally being addressed in most of the camps. The GOP needs to decide which spontaneous camps will be kept open and designate additional sites.  Many of the conditions in the spontaneous camps are unacceptable.  UNHCR needs to identify additional partners to provide basic services in the camps and needs to address the spontaneous camps in both NWFP and AJK.  UNHCR needs additional staff and more resources.  More international NGOs are needed to work in the camps to provide basic services on a long-term basis. This is an extremely urgent issue that is being overshadowed by the critical need to get shelter to the mountain areas and the lack of enough UNHCR staff on the ground.  21.  More assistance needs to be provided for female patients.  The lack of female health care workers is severely limiting female patients' access to medical services. WHO and other health agencies report that more female doctors and nurses are urgently needed.  22.  More technical assistance should be provided to the MoSW.  This technical assistance would help the GOP deal with the issue of unaccompanied children now and create a long-term plan to handle these issues in the future.  23.  It is clear that the MoSW will need a great deal of technical assistance and infrastructure support in identifying and providing care and services for unaccompanied children, separated children with vulnerable families, women-headed households with children, and child headed households.  International organizations and NGOs will have to advocate for establishing good practices in the area of child protection and monitor the work of the government in this area.

As of November 2, approximately 981,800 affected beneficiaries in Pakistan are receiving food aid.  This is 98% of the 1 million caseload identified by the U.N. World Food Program (WFP).  WFP's recent assessment estimates more than 2.3 million people are in need of food aid.  Various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have stated that the number of 2.3 million people in need is too high.  WFP representatives in Pakistan have stated that WFP will maintain its caseload of 1 million people.  WFP has requested that the GOP provide food assistance to the remaining affected populations.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) is bringing in a food expert to assess the need for U.S. food assistance.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- ------------- WFP Joint Emergency Food Security and Nutrition Assessment --------------------------------------------- -------------  2.  Shortly after the earthquake, WFP issued EMOP Pakistan 10491.0.  The EMOP listed the number of beneficiaries as 1,000,000.  On October 26, WFP, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and OXFAM completed a joint Emergency Food Security and Nutrition Assessment to determine the following: the amount of food in country, the amount of additional food coming into the country, the percentage of affected areas needing food, and the amount of food required to assist affected areas.  This assessment identified 2,313,857 people in need of food assistance.  The EMOP figures have been revised accordingly with the Food Requirement for a 5-month period (1 November 2005 through 31 March 2006) at 212,865 metric tons (MT).  3.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) agrees with this finding and is calculating food needs accordingly.  However, various NGOs cite the number of 2.3 million people in need as too high.  WFP representatives in Pakistan have told USAID and USAID/DART representatives that the WFP will maintain its caseload of 1 million and requests that the GOP provide food assistance to the remaining affected beneficiaries.  4.  Additional findings from the WFP Joint Assessment indicate that rice and maize harvest could not be completed in some areas due to landslides and land fissures.  Winter wheat planting would have started in November, but many seed stocks have been buried or spoiled.  The next wheat planting season is summer 2006 with harvest in October 2006.  Fifty percent of the heads of households interviewed in the assessment reported a total loss of grain stocks. Supplementary feeding will be necessary for 440,000 pregnant and lactating women, as well as children under the age of five in rural areas.  ------------------------------ GOP Reaction to WFP Assessment ------------------------------  5.  GOP Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL) Secretary Ismail Qureshi agreed with the WFP assessment that  SIPDIS 2.3 million people are in need of food aid.  In order to meet the food aid need brought on by the earthquake, MINFAL requests 130,000 MT of wheat; 80,000 MT and 50,000 MT will be allocated to the AJK and NWFP, respectively. Calculations are based on a 6-month time frame.  ------------------------------ NGO Reaction to WFP Assessment ------------------------------  6.  On October 29, the USAID/DART Economic and Livelihoods Officer (ELO) met with representatives of the International Refugee Committee (IRC) and Mercy Corps (MC), each of which has at least 20 years experience working in country and employs a number of local residents.  These NGOs hold that fewer than 2.3 million people are in need of emergency food assistance, given existing food stocks, local residents' coping strategies and strong social networks in earthquake- affected areas.  The NGO representatives remarked that if populations living at high elevations are threatened with food insecurity, they travel to lower elevations for food. Because residences at high elevations are scattered and fairly inaccessible, effective food distribution programs would provide food at strategic distribution points.  Food distribution will become more important in the winter months, as stocks run out.  --------------------------------- Other Reactions to WFP Assessment ---------------------------------  7.  An interagency assessment is currently underway and is expected to be completed on/about November 8.  The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are facilitating this assessment; a damage and needs assessment for the agriculture and livestock sector is being conducted by the FAO with MINFAL.  Preliminary findings of damage to crops and food stocks show that slides, collapse of stores, and subsequent rains caused widespread damage.  ------------------------------------- USAID/DART Reaction to WFP Assessment -------------------------------------  8.  According to the USAID/DART ELO, a major coping strategy for food insecurity is male heads of households journeying to the lowlands to purchase food, which they provide to their families upon their return.  Many roads are impassable, but some back trails are accessible, allowing those who live at higher elevations to travel to lower elevations to access markets and purchase food.  WFP reports of widespread loss of food are contrary to information gathered by the USAID/DART in the field and by NGO partners. These reports indicate that although some people lost food stocks in the earthquake, people in earthquake-affected areas have fairly significant stocks of food at present, given the recent harvest.  People in affected areas store food underground or keep food in the form of livestock, thereby insulating themselves against food shocks. Populations in affected areas also draw upon their social networks for safety nets.  Although some food assistance is needed, it is not an immediate need because of existing food stocks, coping mechanisms, and safety networks.  According to the USAID/DART ELO, it is estimated that in general, existing food stocks of those sheltering in place could last up to two months, although those who choose to reside in camps will require immediate food assistance.  -------------------------- GOP Request for Assistance --------------------------  9.  The Pakistan Agriculture Storage Services Corporation (PASSCO) has "operating reserves" of 1 million MT of wheat. Prior to the earthquake, the planned distribution of the 1 million MT of stocks was: NWFP 270,000 MT; AJK 250,000 MT; Defense Department 150,000 MT; Northern Areas 100,000 MT; Balochistan 230,000.  This distribution is based on last year's needs in these food deficit areas.  The GOP estimates requirements of 123 kilograms (kg) of wheat per person per year.  The provinces of Punjab and Sindh meet their own wheat needs by production and private commercial purchases.  10.  The GOP does maintain an operating reserve of 1 million tons.  Therefore, it does not have any reserves to support the affected beneficiaries.  The GOP requests a total of 130,000 MT of wheat to meet the needs of 2.3 million affected people.  To date, the GOP has loaned the WFP 30,000 metric tons (MT) of food aid.  According to the GOP, the Government of Turkey has donated 50,000 MT of food aid which will arrive in 30 days.  The GOP requests that the U.S. Government donate the remaining 50,000 MT of food aid.  -------------------------- Food Distributions to Date --------------------------  11.  WFP has the lead in coordinating food aid and logistics under the UN clusters groups framework.  WFP reported that to date, 518,000 people have received WFP food rations, including high energy biscuits, wheat flour, vegetable oil, and pulses.  Because many roads in valleys are fully or partially blocked, food distributions are taking place at roadblocks as far into the valleys as possible.  From distribution points, mule packs carry food further up into the mountains.  WFP reported a number of distribution constraints.  12.  On October 30, a WFP representative told a USAID/DART representative that WFP plans to provide food assistance for 1 million people because it expects the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide food assistance for 150,000 people and the GOP to provide food assistance for the remaining people in need.  13.  MINFAL does not anticipate any disruption of commercial sales by importing additional wheat for the affected areas. Commercial sales since July 2005 total approximately 580,000 MT.  The commercially purchased wheat stays in Karachi and is not transported to the rest of Pakistan.  Therefore, MINFAL does not anticipate a disruption in local markets by additional imported wheat.  --------------------------------- Constraints to Food Distributions ---------------------------------  14.  With the onset of winter, food aid will need to be pre- positioned for approximately 200,000 affected beneficiaries in remote areas.  Preliminary findings of damage and food need assessments show damage to crops and stores of seed and fertilizer.  Food aid will become increasingly important in the winter months as remaining food stocks run out.  The November winter wheat planting has been limited by damages to land and the destruction of agricultural inputs. Therefore, the 2006 spring/summer harvest of wheat will be drastically affected and may require food aid to continue through October 2006.  15.  A USAID/DART food expert will arrive in country by 8 November to ascertain the level of U.S. food assistance that will be required.   CROCKER

From November 2 through 9, Deputy Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Greg Gottlieb visited Pakistan to work with USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) on developing programming and staffing plans for next approximately 150 days of the earthquake emergency.  Mr. Gottlieb also visited several field sites to discuss current programs and concerns with partners, the government of Pakistan (GOP) military, and others.  -------- Staffing --------  2.    The USAID/DART currently consists of 18 members with a broad array of skills.  The general approach is to maintain critical functions in all program, technical support, logistics, and administration as the USAID/DART pushes to meet pressing needs for affected populations prior to the onset of heavy winter.  Several essential staff members are rotating out close to the Thanksgiving holiday.  The USAID/DART has been working with the Response Management Team (RMT) to develop a staffing plan for this critical period. Most positions now have names assigned or proposed, and the USAID/DART is confident that critical functions will be met during the critical period.  While the total number of positions will likely diminish as certain functions are collapsed into a single position, particularly for certain logistics and administrative functions, all essential functions will continue to be filled.  3.    Staffing must be addressed, however, for the period of January through April of calendar year 2006.  Personnel for at least two program officer positions and an administrative officer position in Islamabad, as well as two field officer positions outside Islamabad, must be identified to serve at least for 90 to 120 days.  It would be preferable if a USAID/DART leader also served for the same period of time, but it is foreseeable that experienced leaders could rotate in and out for lesser periods.  4.  The USAID/DART anticipates that it will need to maintain an active and thorough presence at least through April 2006, when the onset of spring will allow many people displaced by the earthquake to return home, especially to remote areas, and actively begin reconstruction.  The presence of longer-term staff will provide consistency of leadership to partners and programs, and enable the USAID/DART to work on a sustained basis with the USAID Mission on integration of relief programs into reconstruction programs.  ----------- Programming -----------  5.  Focus over the next four to six weeks is on securing populations through the spring.  The USAID/DART will continue to support shelter-in-place programs, particularly for more remote areas.  The USAID/DART is not downplaying the need to prepare for many more people coming into camps, but it feels that current programming must focus on supplying those who will stay in place at higher elevations with shelter or shelter materials adequate to get them through the winter. The USAID/DART recognizes that many of those affected may eventually come into camps, in which case the USAID/DART intends to structure funding so that programs can be shifted to camp situations if necessary.  6.    Shelter will therefore be the focus of future funding, along with water and sanitation, and livelihoods and cash-for-work (CFW) programs.  The USAID/DART is currently reviewing proposals to add additional partners in geographic areas that USAID is not now serving.  The team is also considering adding on to current grants to deepen and broaden the reach of existing partners during the next six weeks.  In addition, the USAID/DART Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA) is working with all current international NGO partners, as well as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which is both a USAID/OFDA grantee and a cluster leader, to develop an overall strategy.   The USAID/DART SSA has brought a high level of expertise to a situation still lacking cohesiveness.  The SSA has effectively persuaded the GOP that tents are not the only solution to shelter problem. The USAID/DART shelter strategy will help partners to focus their efforts on appropriate approaches.  It is clear that partners are anxious for leadership in the shelter sector.  7.    The USAID/DART will also focus on support aspects to field programs, including support to civilian air operations.  The USAID/DART anticipates and sees the need forhJe?8@b true in every place of operation, the overall feeling is of a need for improvement. The USAID/DART hopes that the arrival on November 5 of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Chief of Operations will bring about better coordination between and by UN agencies.  Moreover, the USAID/DART will pursue discussions with OCHA on making U.N. offices more operational.  It appears that several U.N. agencies, notably UNICEF and UNHCR, are still struggling to define their roles as either advisors or operational agencies, when it is apparent that they need to pursue both aspects.

On November 5, Deputy Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Greg Gottlieb, accompanied by the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), traveled to earthquake-affected areas.  The group met with implementing partners and members of the Government of Pakistan (GOP) military in Mehra tent camp, Batagram, and Balakot.  This cable summarizes the group's findings.  -------- Batagram --------  2.  The USAID/DART Field Officer (FO) working at the forward base in Mansehra accompanied the group for the day.  Mr. Gottlieb and the USAID/DART traveled to Batagram, where they met with representatives of the GOP military, the Austrian Red Cross, and two of USAID's implementing partners, Save the Children (SC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  The SC representative told the USAID/DART that SC has treated 25,000 patients and performed 450 operations in SC medical facilities in Batagram.  GOP has designated SC as the coordinating agency for all of Batagram District.  3.  Mr. Gottlieb met with the regional GOP army commander, Brigadier Khalid, to discuss current relief efforts in Batagram.  The GOP military remains focused on providing shelter materials, particularly tents, to populations in remote areas, although they did not present statistics on how many households have been reached.  The team observed a large stock of tents being airlifted to mountainous areas.  ----- Mehra -----  4.  The USAID/DART traveled with Mr. Gottlieb to the Mehra tent camp, where they met with GOP camp commander Colonel Fraz and other GOP representatives operating the camp, as well as representatives of NGOs providing services to the camp.  The tent camp currently occupies an area of 53,000 square meters.  The GOP plans to add three additional subsectors, each with an approximate area of 50,000 square meters, for a total of 195,000 square meters.  GOP representatives estimate that each subsector can accommodate 900 to 1,100 families.  5.  With an average family size in this camp of eight or nine people, the Mehra site will accommodate up to 30,000 people and has been designed to house people from the Allai mountains and valley, which has a total population of approximately 190,000 people.  Established on October 31, the tent camp was a temporary home to approximately 300 families, or approximately 2,700 people, as of November 5. Thirty new families arrived in the morning of November 5, and Colonel Fraz stated that he expected high numbers of families to arrive as winter approaches.  After the Eid holidays, more people may come down from higher elevations. Since the camp site is only at about 2,000 feet elevation, snowfall should be minimal.  6.  Colonel Fraz stated that when a family arrives, the GOP requests the family's identification cards to register camp inhabitants.  Following registration, the GOP gives each family a basket of commodities, which comprises a tent, mattress, blankets, utensils, and food rations for a week.  -- Food  7.  Inhabitants of the Mehra tent camp arrive without food. They are dependent upon the GOP for food.  There appeared to be adequate food stocks for the current population.  Colonel Fraz told the USAID/DART that he would like a communal kitchen to be built.  At present, women are cooking meals for their families inside their tents, which presents a fire hazard.  SC is procuring 300 small propane burners for cooking.  -- Water and Sanitation  8.  At present, two 10,000-liter water purification units, provided by the Austrian Red Cross, are in the camp.  Water from the Indus River is pumped into these units, where it is purified and then pumped to access points in the camp.  The GOP plans to install two water tanks, with a 100,000-liter capacity each, on a hill above the camp.  9.  When the USAID/DART visited Mehra, sanitation was the primary problem in the Mehra tent camp.  As of November 5, there were no latrines in the camp.  However, according to representatives of Save the Children, who spoke with the USAID/DART on November 9, 100 latrines - 50 for men and 50 for women - had recently been installed in the camp.  -- Health  10.  The GOP told Mr. Gottlieb and the USAID/DART that 14 doctors from Cuba are volunteering in the camp.  However, the doctors speak minimal English and no Urdu.  Camp inhabitants have reported a number of illnesses, including bloody diarrhea, watery diarrhea, a few cases of tetanus, and many cases of scabies.  -- Livelihoods  11. According to a SC representative, more people would come to the Mehra tent camp if the camp had a site for livestock grazing, which it currently does not.  People are afraid of coming to the tent camp if that means leaving their livestock, which is often their livelihood, behind.  SC is planning a corral for animals, with an attendant veterinarian.  This will enable families to maintain their animals rather than sell now in a depressed livestock market.  12.  SC plans to establish a cash-for-work (CFW) committee to maintain the tent village.  SC will pay members of the committee to perform maintenance and repairs on the physical facilities of the camp.  The GOP military representative told the group that because many of the men living in the camp are skilled workers, the GOP is interested in implementing CFW programs.  -- Protection  13.  Colonel Fraz stated that the majority of the population of surrounding areas lived in mud houses prior to the earthquake.  In order to preserve a sense of community and local culture, the GOP has laid out the tent camp site at Mehra such that people in the camp live close to people from their home village, in separate areas representing the major villages in the region.  14.  Among the Cuban doctors in the camp are female doctors. Members of the GOP military and NGO representatives working in the camp were acutely aware of the cultural needs for females, ranging from having female doctors to adequate latrines and working stations, in addition to better lighting for the camp.  15.  IOM representatives told the USAID/DART that male heads of households might send their families to the camp but remain with their livestock.  If this happens, additional protection issues will arise.  -- NGO Assistance at Mehra  16.  NGOs have provided a significant amount of the commodities and services at Mehra.  SC provided blankets, rations, and tarpaulins, and it is in the process of procuring hygiene kits and establishing a play space, educational center, and area for livestock grazing.  As described above, the Austrian Red Cross is working to meet the water and sanitation needs of the camp.  The U.N. was seemingly absent.  Colonel Fraz noted several times that representatives from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had visited several times but had not done anything to date.  -- Outstanding Needs  17.  The GOP military representative in charge of the camp remarked that the Mehra tent camp needs additional large generators for the health unit and water system; searchlights, which provide light and enhance camp security at night; and latrines.  -- GOP and NGOs' Two-Pronged Strategy  18.  The GOP and NGOs are engaged in a two-pronged strategy to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the earthquake.  The GOP and relief organizations are simultaneously delivering relief commodities to hard-to- reach areas in order to promote shelter in place, and the GOP and relief organizations are also attempting to provide basic services to tent camps to encourage people in need of shelter to temporarily relocate to camps.  19.  This strategy is evident in Mehra camp.  The GOP military, in conjunction with NGOs in Mehra camp, is attempting to move supplies up the Allai Valley.  The road up the valley recently opened to small vehicles and pickups. The GOP and NGOS have a limited ability to move humanitarian commodities up the valley, however.  Under the direction of the GOP military, IOM is sending small pickups up the valley to encourage people in the valley to come down to the Mehra tent camp.  Concurrently, the GOP is overseeing the establishment of facilities in the Mehra camp to entice people to come down from the valley and into the camp.  -- USAID/DART Assessment and Recommendations  20.  The USAID/DART acknowledges that many more people may come down into tent camps.  However, the USAID/DART holds that current programming must focus on supplying those who will stay at higher elevations with shelter or shelter materials, sufficient to protect them against the winter weather.  Many of the affected people may eventually come into camps, in which case the USAID/DART intends to adjust funding and shift program focus to camp situations if necessary.  ------- Balakot -------  21.  Mr. Gottlieb and the USAID/DART also traveled to Balakot, where they discussed the distribution of humanitarian relief supplies with GOP military representatives in charge of the distribution and assessed the situation on the ground.  The population of Balakot and the surrounding areas is approximately 350,000 people.  In this area, approximately 20,000 people perished in the earthquake, according to a member of the GOP military. Areas of Balakot, including the area that the USAID/DART visited, are nearly 100 percent destroyed.  A member of the GOP military told the USAID/DART that despite this total destruction, people are reluctant to leave their homes, as they hope that they will be able to salvage any remaining personal effects once they are able to sift through the rubble.  The USAID/DART observed a number of people living in makeshift shelters above the ruins of their destroyed homes.  Recovery of bodies had only ended a few days previously.  22.  A representative of the GOP military told the USAID/DART that the GOP encourages the establishment of tent villages because such villages facilitate the distribution of commodities.  The USAID/DART observed piles of commodities for distribution near the helicopter landing pad in Balakot.  The GOP military was coordinating the distribution of these commodities.  (Comment:  In Balakot, as at the Mansehra tent camp site, Mr. Gottlieb and the USAID/DART observed a distinct absence of the U.N.  End comment.)  -- Meeting with ACTED  23.  In Balakot, Mr. Gottlieb and the USAID/DART met with two representatives of ACTED, one of USAID's implementing partners.  According to these representatives, ACTED arrived in Balakot and Bagh o/a October 15.  ACTED is targeting remote areas in the west valley above Balakot, where other NGOs are absent.  Through funding from the USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), ACTED aims to reach 3,000 beneficiaries with housing interventions.  ACTED might decrease the materials it is distributing to each family in order to serve more families.  Many heads of households located at higher elevations are descending to Balakot to obtain blankets and quilts, which they bring with them back to their families.  Very little information about targeted populations is available.  It is unclear how many people live in the valley where ACTED is working, although there are indications that the number is very large.  24.  ACTED reported effective cooperation with the GOP military.  ACTED stated that when it has commodities for distribution, it relays this message to the GOP military the day before the distribution, who in turn relays this information to affected populations.  People from affected areas travel by foot up to four hours to obtain commodities supplied by ACTED.  25.  In the absence of a shelter strategy from the international community, ACTED is distributing plastic sheeting and tools.  ACTED is attempting to procure these materials and move these materials as quickly as possible to remote locations.  26.  ACTED stated, and the USAID/DART observed, that the U.N. was noticeably absent from Balakot.  ACTED representatives told the USAID/DART that Balakot lacks coordination from the U.N.  Thus, the GOP military hosts daily coordination meetings with NGOs.  Because of a shortage of undamaged office space, the majority of the NGOs active in Balakot are based in Mansehra, which compounds the coordination problem in Balakot.  Most of the NGOs in Mansehra are focused on humanitarian relief efforts in Batagram, not Balakot.  -- USAID/DART Assessment and Recommendations  27.  As is the case with other areas that the USAID/DART has assessed, the U.N. was absent in the area of Balakot that the USAID/DART surveyed on November 5.  The U.N. is not coordinating cluster group meetings in this area, and the GOP military has begun hosting such meetings.  The apparent absence of the U.N. in its role as coordinating mechanism, as well as the lack of U.N. commodities in this area, is problematic.  28.   Organizations providing humanitarian assistance in Balakot, as in Mehra, should pursue the two-pronged strategy of both providing humanitarian commodities for those who have sought refuge in camps and also transporting and distributing commodities in hard-to-reach areas.

The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) subscribes to the overall Government of Pakistan (GOP) Federal Relief Commission (FRC) strategy that primary focus at this stage in the relief effort should be placed on providing in-situ shelter and food security support for earthquake-affected residents.  Through its non-governmental organization (NGO) programming, the USAID/DART supports this strategy with implementation activities that focus on commodity distribution, shelter, water and sanitation, livelihoods, protection, health, and education.  The USAID/DART has programmed its NGO funds judiciously to cover the key sectors in critical geographic areas in a balanced, strategic manner.  End summary.  ---------------- Funding Strategy ----------------  2.  The USAID/DART subscribes to the overall GOP FRC strategy that primary focus at this stage in the relief effort should be placed on providing in-situ shelter and food security support for earthquake-affected residents. Secondary focus should be placed on camp-based needs for those who come down from higher elevations due to their inability to endure the harsh winter conditions.  This dual strategy both addresses the priorities of the locals and implements a fail-safe mechanism to assure survival.  3.  USAID/DART field reports as well as reports from NGOs indicate that much of the earthquake-affected population will remain in place, but a significant number will move down to lowland areas to reside in both spontaneous and organized tented camps.  A two-pronged strategy provides the best means to address both situations.  --------------- NGO Programming ---------------  4.  Through its NGO programming, the USAID/DART supports this overall strategy with implementation activities that focus on commodity distribution, shelter, water and sanitation, livelihoods, protection, health, and education. As of November 10, nine international NGOs have been selected to receive an approximate total of USD 20 million through USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  The activities funded in these grants emphasize the primary focus of in-situ shelter, livelihoods, health, and education.  They also cover camp-based needs in water and sanitation, livelihoods, health, and protection.  U.N. organizations have received more than USD 12.9 million in OFDA funding in response to the earthquake.  In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have received USD 8 million in OFDA funding.  OFDA has funded NGOs and U.N. organizations in order to target affected populations in rural and urban areas, respectively.  5.  The USAID/DART is regularly meeting with the country directors of the NGOs currently receiving USAID funds to discuss their issues, bottlenecks, and collective means of maximizing impact.  The USAID/DART believes that targeting NGO activities to the greatest needs of the two-pronged strategy, and facilitating frequent discussions to optimize and possibly redirect activities, represents a targeted yet flexible means of addressing the greatest needs in the relief effort of Pakistan.  6.  This support to NGOs has been provided in a deliberate, phased manner.  The USAID/DART has committed three tranches of funds.  The first round total was approximately USD 22 million, including support for four U.N. agencies:  the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Joint Logistics Center (JLC), the U.N. World Food Program (WFP), and the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO).  Through this first round of funding, the USAID/DART also committed support to IOM, ICRC, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), primarily for cluster-based coordination and technical support.  The second round total was USD 11.5 million, provided to Action Contre la Faim (ACF), ACTED, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), GOAL, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to kick-start field activities in non-food item distribution, shelter, water and sanitation, health, education, and livelihoods.  7.  The third round of proposals is currently under review. For this round, international and local NGOs have submitted approximately 25 proposals.  The USAID/DART, including its technical experts, is carefully scrutinizing these proposals to ensure focus on strategy, high-quality implementation, appropriate geographical distribution based on need, accountability of funds, and current gaps.  Various proposals passed the initial screening for the third round, and thus far three are recommended for funding.  8.  The USAID/DART is utilizing maps provided by the U.N. and U.S. military to determine where to meet the needs of the earthquake-affected population.  The USAID/DART is also encouraging NGOs to work in the most affected areas.  Before approving funding, the USAID/DART undertakes checks to ensure that NGOs do not overlap coverage.  9.  These three tranches of grants constitute a step-by-step approach in order to ensure that NGOs are not only working effectively but also are able to address the emergency relief needs that evolve over the course of this disaster relief operation.  ------------------------------- NGOs and GOP Military Relations -------------------------------  10.  While NGOs typically tend to be critical of government responses in disaster situations, the USAID/DART's NGO partners have praised the GOP military's participation in this disaster.  NGOs active in this disaster response have indicated that the GOP military is distributing tents in an appropriate manner and in critical need areas.  Despite media reports to the contrary, USAID cites reports from NGO field representatives to assert that the GOP military has assumed a great deal of responsibility in the relief efforts and performed well under difficult circumstances. Not only has the GOP military proven effective in this exercise in terms of its reach and responsiveness, but it has also been keen to learn from the donor community best practices in addressing technical issues such as camp management, relief commodity distribution, and water and sanitation interventions.  ---------------------------------- USAID/DART Collaboration with NGOs ----------------------------------  11.  The USAID/DART thus continues to work closely with NGOs that have potential to be effective in this context, and will achieve the balance of providing strong and effective support to the relief efforts while exercising flexibility and judiciousness in the use of available resources.

On November 6, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) met with representatives of all seven implementing partners in Pakistan.  On November 7, Deputy Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Greg Gottlieb and USAID/DART staff met with Kevin Kennedy, the new U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Senior Humanitarian Advisor for Pakistan.  Building on input the USAID/DART received in the November 6 meeting, Mr. Gottlieb, Mr. Kennedy, and others discussed the current state of U.N. activities and humanitarian coordination.  End summary.  ---------- Background ----------  2.  On November 6, the USAID/DART met with representatives of OFDA,s implementing partners in Pakistan:  ACTED, Action Against Hunger, International Rescue Committee (IRC), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), GOAL, Mercy Corps, and Save the Children/US.  In this meeting, representatives of all seven implementing partners stated that the U.N. is not operational in most areas, and in areas where it is functioning, it is ineffective.  According to the non-governmental organization (NGO) partners, the U.N. is neither stepping up to its role as coordinating mechanism nor sending effective representatives to the field.  ----------------------------------- Meeting between USAID/OFDA and OCHA -----------------------------------  3.  On November 7, Mr. Gottlieb and members of the USAID/DART met with Mr. Kennedy, who has just arrived in Pakistan as the OCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor.  At present, the U.N. has a permanently positioned Resident Coordinator whose responsibilities generally include managing emergency relief operations.  Mr. Kennedy assumed humanitarian duties that the Resident Coordinator has previously shouldered alone.  4.  In the meeting, Mr. Gottlieb drew from the information he received at the November 6 meeting and from two days of field visits, outlining the problems that the USAID/DART has identified in the current U.N. cluster system.  Mr. Gottlieb stated that at present, an insufficient number of U.N. personnel are on the ground, and those who are on the ground lack adequate experience coordinating emergency relief efforts.  Mr. Gottlieb noted that within the U.N. cluster system, little coordination between the cluster groups in Islamabad and the field exists.  The shelter cluster is particularly weak, and it has not made plans for protection in the camps.  Mr. Gottlieb stated that he believes a disconnect exists between the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and NGO activities.  5.  Mr. Kennedy stated that the international community needs to recognize the primacy of the GOP military in the humanitarian relief operation, relative to other disasters. Based on his limited time in country, Mr. Kennedy agreed with the USAID/DART,s observation that coordination in the field appears to be much better than coordination in Islamabad.  He also remarked on the importance of coordinating helicopter operations, which are currently being conducted by seven groups, both military and civilian.  6.  Mr. Kennedy remarked that the GOP Army Engineers, current rate of shelter repair is far too slow.  Mr. Kennedy stated that he hoped that the Operation Winter Race concept developed by the U.N. Joint Logistics Center (JLC) and World Food Program (WFP) will help close the gap.  Mr. Gottlieb noted that NGO representatives throughout earthquake-affected areas have stated that the U.N. Children,s Fund (UNICEF) is the most effective U.N. agency in this disaster response, while NGO representatives and others working in the field are most concerned with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, (UNHCR) performance in camp management and protection and the International Organization for Migration,s (IOM) performance in shelter.  7.  The USAID/DART team leader highlighted the importance of influencing Major General Nadeem Ahmed, Deputy Chairman of the Federal Relief Commission, on shelter construction.  Mr. Kennedy replied that it is critical that UNHCR staff in Pakistan take a more active role in camp establishment and management.  He also stated that a full-time U.N. presence is necessary in any Joint Operations Center that the GOP may establish.  ----------- Conclusions -----------  8.  USAID,s NGO implementing partners in Pakistan are unanimous in their concern with the poor performance ) and, in some cases, total absence ) of the U.N. in the humanitarian relief efforts.  9.  The USAID/DART believes that the arrival of Mr. Kennedy as Senior Humanitarian Advisor will have a very positive impact on U.N. management of the emergency relief operation as it enters a critical phase.

This cable summarizes the current situation with regard to a number of critical items, and reviews OFDA efforts to address shortfalls where necessary.  While it is difficult to identify shortfalls with any degree of precision, it appears that while there may be an overall surplus of tents in general, properly winterized tents (both family sized and larger ones) remain in short supply.  End summary.  1. DART staff has reviewed documents from the Government of Pakistan Federal Relief Commission (FRC), information from various UN reports, and input from a number of NGO implementing partners, in order to evaluate current requirements and available supplies for a number of critical non-food items.  These include tents, blankets, stoves, plastic sheeting, corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets, and plywood.  2. While the overall number of available tents is close to the FRC requirement, most of these are not designed for cold weather, and sufficiently winterized tents remain in short supply.  Estimates of total tents now distributed, in warehouses awaiting distribution, and in the pipeline (with estimated delivery by 30 November) vary from 500,000 to over 600,000.  The current overall requirement, according to the FRC, is 473,000, suggesting a surplus ranging from 25,000 to over 100,000.  Several caveats should be noted regarding these numbers.  On the one hand, UN OCHA believes that many tents have been double counted, because of both donors and implementing NGOs taking credit for the same tents, which would reduce the available supply.  Also, a number of tents were evidently lost during airdrops to remote areas.  On the other hand, the pipeline estimate does not include additional surplus tents from DOD (over 3,000) which we anticipate receiving.  In addition, the FRC tent requirement has not been adjusted downward to account for various non-tent shelter-in-place solutions (plastic sheeting, CGI roofs, etc.).  3. In addition to small (family-sized) tents, there is still a major requirement for large tents that can serve as schools or medical clinics.  The GOP estimates that over 6,000 schools were destroyed, and another 5,500 damaged, in the two affected provinces, as well as over 350 health facilities. Based on this damage, the GoP has projected a need for 30,000 large tents as a subset of the overall requirement.  We have provided about 300 military GP Medium and Large tents to NGO partners, and several hundred more are in the DOD pipeline. We are now in the process of bringing in over 100 large high altitude tents from Alaska for the Government of Pakistan, and over 450 large tents, now in Kabul, for the Pakistani NGO RSPN.  The FRC has not provided an estimate of current and projected supplies for large tents.  The DART believes that the anticipated US contribution will not be sufficient to close the gap, and will continue to seek additional DOD tents and encourage other donors to contribute large tents.  4. The requirement for blankets is somewhat ambiguous.  FRC estimates a total requirement of 3.3 million, with over 2.7 million now provided.  According to UN OCHA, there are about 400,000 more in the pipeline.  However, the FRC just this week halved its blanket requirement (from 6.6 million), and identified a new requirement for an equal number of mattresses (3.3 million).  There are no figures available on current or projected supplies of mattresses.  Some NGO partners are providing foam pads, which they are easily sourcing locally, while others are providing extra blankets (anywhere from two to five per recipient) instead of mattresses.  As such, we can assume an outstanding blanket requirement of anywhere from 200,000 to over 2 million. Discussions with NGO partners indicate that, although there may not be sufficient blankets available in Pakistan, there are more stocks in the region that may be accessed.  About 200,000 additional blankets have been identified in DOD stocks for this operation.  If needed by NGOs, DART logistics team has found several local sources for commercial procurement of blankets.  5. Small stoves for cooking and heating are another new item recently added by the FRC.  Their estimate is identical to the tent requirement (473,000), suggesting one stove per household.  However, NGO partners believe that a significant number of people, at least 20 percent, would have kept stoves from their permanent homes, reducing the overall requirement.  Again, there is no way of accurately estimating the current supply or pipeline.  Some NGOs are procuring propane stoves, for use in urban areas at lower altitudes where gas supply is possible, while most are looking at wood burning, Bukhari type stoves.  Some NGOs have found that these are now in short supply in Pakistan, and lead times are too long (45 days or more).  DART Logistics has found local commercial sources if needed by NGOs, and such stoves can be procured in India and other countries in the region.  6. In addition to items identified by FRC, DART has looked into the availability of several other critical commodities. One item consistently requested by partners is additional USAID specification plastic sheeting (in fact, one NGO alone requested 2000 to 4000 rolls).  To date we have provided 6,150 rolls of sheeting to NGOs, but given its multiple uses the requirement is significantly higher.  DART is now procuring on a test basis 5,000 locally produced plastic tarps (roughly equivalent to 450 rolls, though of a thinner grade) for implementing partners, and has identified other commercial sources for such sheeting.  Already two implementing partners alone are in the process of procuring over 35,000 sheets of such plastic.  While this thinner plastic may not be ideal, the DART does not at this time anticipate a need to completely exhaust all worldwide OFDA stocks of plastic sheeting for this operation.  7. A second item which is essential to our shelter strategy is corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) for roofing of damaged houses.  DART has conducted a market analysis of locally available CGI and provided this info to implementing partners.  Several NGOs are already procuring CGI from these and other sources.  In addition, the Government of Pakistan is making major purchases of CGI itself to support shelter. The DART does not anticipate a requirement to import CGI from the US or other sources outside the region.  8. Finally, the DART has looked into available sources of plywood, which are critical to construction of latrines. Both DART assessments and discussions with implementing partners indicate that latrines are in dreadfully short supply.  Failure to address this need rapidly will exacerbate public health problems, especially in tented camps.  DART is now procuring 500 sheets of plywood locally, which will probably be provided to UNICEF.  In addition the US Navy Engineers (Seabees) now operating at Muzaffarabad are constructing latrines.  DART Logistics has identified local commercial sources of plywood for our NGO partners.  9. In addition to supplies of key commodities, the FRC has identified other critical requirements that are quantified by budget figures rather than numbers of items.  In the water/sanitation sector, the FRC estimates $10 million is needed for water tankers, pumps, generators, purification tablets, trucks and incinerators.  This figure, however, does not include any funding for construction of latrines.  In the public health sector, the FRC has estimated that $8.5 million is needed for immunizations, disease surveillance, drugs, medical equipment, and vector control.  The donors, conference scheduled for November 19 will address these and other longer term sectoral needs in much greater detail.  10. In the next few weeks, the Government of Pakistan, UN, and NGOs will undertake a major effort to move critical supplies to vulnerable earthquake affected areas before the onset of winter.  It is expected that estimates of anticipated supplies and shortfalls of key items will change, as more items are distributed and the better information is available from the field.  The DART will continue to refine its analysis and report on the changing situation in the weeks to come.     CROCKER 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 016850  SIPDIS  DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, AEMR, ASEC, MASS, MOPS, ECON, PGOV, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  KAGHAN AND ALLAI VALLEYS  1. Summary: A team from the Embassy's Forward Operating Base in Mansehra (Officer-in-Charge (OIC), USAID/DART Field Officer, U.S. Military Liaison Officer) and representatives of five USAID-funded NGOs visited the Northern Kaghan and Allai Valleys on November 9.  In both areas, Pakistan military commanders are strongly encouraging villagers to relocate for the winter to facilitate assistance efforts.  In northern Kaghan, where most families migrate south to Balakot annually, this advice is being followed.  In Allai, however, most people appear reluctant to leave and will continue to require significant assistance.  Alternative shelter programs will be critical to survival in Allai during the winter months.  Geological activity in Allai remains a significant concern and rumors of volcanic activity continue to persist. Villagers appear grateful for USG assistance and have a generally positive view of Pakistan army efforts.  They are, however, resentful at the provincial government and many political parties for their perceived lack of response.  End Summary.  Kaghan Valley -------------  2. The northern end of the Kaghan Valley centered around the town of Narang was completely isolated by landslides that destroyed the area's one access road.  Resupply of this area of Kaghan has been limited to helicopter support flights from the Pakistan militar.  The road opened for the first time to light vehicle traffic on the morning of the delegation's arrival.  According to local villagers, the area around Narang has traditionally been seen as having too harsh a climate for winter settlement.  Most villagers spend 8 months of the year in Narang engaged in both agriculture and the tourist industry and then move down the valley to Balakot for the winter after the final potato harvest.  Prior to the earthquake most families had temporary shelter for themselves and their livestock in Balakot.  This is now destroyed.  3.  Villagers told us that, as in previous years, only about 25 people will remain in the Narang area during the winter. Most will stay in the tourist hotels, which did not appear to sustain significant damage during the earthquake.  Foodstocks in the village are sufficient for these remaining individuals.  Those intending to leave the village will do so in about 12 days, after the harvest is in.  There is a serious concern among villagers that the tent camp being established in Jaba Farms (where the army is encouraging villagers to go) lacks sufficient tents, facilities for livestock, and education for children.  The private schools in Balakot in which parents usually enrolled their children are now piles of rubble.  This migratory pattern contrasts with the southern Kaghan Valley, where at least half the population has told NGOs that they intend to remain in place for the winter.  Based on this information, U.S.-funded NGOs intend to continue to focus their supply efforts in southern Kaghan operating out of Paras.  Allai Valley ------------  4.  FOB Team visited two sites in the Allai Valley: the Rashang Union Council and the town of Bana, the center of relief operations.  Military officials present in both locations were adamant that villagers had to leave the valley to survive.  They were strongly encouraging villagers to migrate south to the tent city being established in Marai, Shangla District.  For a variety of reasons, villagers seemed reluctant to make this transition.  Those we spoke with cited concern for their property, safety of their domestic animals, historical ties to their villages, and suspicion about conditions in the camps.  Military officials, in cooperation with NGOs, faced an uphill battle addressing these concerns. Even the most optimistic officials that we spoke with estimated that only half the area's population of 60,000 would move south. Based on movement to date (the harvest in Allai is essentially finished), the final numbers departing may be far lower.  5.  The major need in the Allai Valley appears to be shelter.  Insufficient numbers of winterized tents have arrived, although shipments by helicopter (essential due to blocked roads in many areas) continue to arrive.  Military and NGO representatives were skeptical that even properly winterized tents would be sufficient to allow individuals to survive in the harsh winter climate of the area.  In addition, transport of such tents before the weather shifts appears a near impossible task.  As an alternative, NGOs strongly pushed for funding of alternative shelter programs.  These would provide construction kits and advice to enable villagers to rebuild appropriate accommodation using materials from their collapsed houses.  Villagers seemed open to the idea and were already recovering stones, timber, and corrugated sheeting from their collapsed properties, most of which could easily be reused.  Foodstocks in Allai appear in relatively good shape, despite some damage from the earthquake, although no comprehensive study is available.  Prepositioning of food is still a welcome activity, although some of it may go unused. Villagers continued to report smoke and fire coming from some mountains in Allai.  Military commander in Rashang reported that Battela Mountain was a particular concern.  Political Perceptions ---------------------  6.  Villagers were uniformly positive about the USG role. Many had received supplies from U.S. military and INL helicopters and clearly believed that we were going to assist long-term.  The active presence of U.S.-funded NGOs in the Allai Valley further enhances this positive view.  Similarly, villagers were grateful to the Pakistan Army for its role in facilitating assistance.  Soldiers were often the first relief personnel on the ground and had delivered a great deal to the local populace.  The only tinge of resentment was towards the consistent messages requesting villagers to leave their homes.  The provincial government was routinely criticized for its virtually invisibility.    Villagers claimed that, although provincial ministers and officials had visited, they had done nothing to provide needed relief. Asked about the political parties, there was great resentment towards the Pakistan Muslim League, Pakistan People's Party, Awami National Party, and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman.  Village elders claimed none of them had done anything to help and were only interested in votes.  Frequent contrasts were made with Jamaat-i-Islami, whose on-the-ground relief camps appear to have done a great deal to improve its image.  Comment -------  7.  The northern Kaghan Valley appears unique in the area, as it already has a long history of winter migration to the south.  We do not believe that other areas will follow this pattern.  Particularly in the Allai Valley, in-place assistance will be critical through the winter months and must include an immediate emphasis on alternative shelter that can be developed in relatively short order.  Food supplies in these areas will need to be monitored by on-the-ground personnel and logistical plans will need to be developed to distribute on an as-needed basis.  8.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 016875  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE  KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A DEPT - PLEASE PASS TO USAID  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, ECON, ASEC, AEMR, MASS, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE:  AREAS IN MANSEHRA DISTRICT WITHOUT ASSISTANCE   1. (U)  Summary:  Embassy Forward Operating Base - Mansehra Officer-in-Charge (OIC) and Emboff accompanied NWFP Parliament minority leader on a November 7 tour of Mansehra tehsil.  During the visit, it became clear that relief was not reaching several areas damaged by the October 8 earthquake.  Resentment at the provincial and national governments remains high in these areas and may cost the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) and Pakistan Muslim League (PML) significantly.  Ironically, the natural beneficiaries of such resentment, the Awami National Party (ANP) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) are noticeably absent.  End Summary.  2.  (U)  At the invitation of the NWFP parliament minority leader, OIC and Emboff visited the towns of Bafa, Ghulibal, Guidepur, and Kularha, all located in Mansehra tehsil. During the visit, OIC observed that, despite reports to the contrary, damage in these villages was extensive.  Much of the damage was in the interior of housing compounds, where back and interior residential walls had collapsed, thereby evading the initial rapid assessments.  With most NGOs and IOs focused on the more visibly damaged areas of Balakot, Battgram, and Allai, villagers have received little or no assistance.  Shelter needs appear particularly acute in these areas.  Only tens of tents, most sent by friends and relatives in other parts of the country, have reached the area although up to 6000 may be needed.  3.  (U)  Minority leader Khan has generated significant goodwill in this area, which he claimed had not supported him in the last election, through provision of 200 tents distributed throughout the area.  According to local leaders, no other political leader has provided any significant support.  Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F), the previously leading party in the area, was described as hypocritical by local leaders.  It had sought support during elections, but abandoned the people in their time of need. Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), whose al-Khidmat Foundation had established nearby camps, clearly had little support in the villages.  Elders claimed a reluctance to accepts JI support, as "the party always wanted something in return."  4. (U)  Locals expressed the strongest ire for the provincial government and the civilian side of the federal government, which they equated with the Pakistan Muslim League (PML). Villagers claimed that they accepted that the army and internationals needed to focus on more devastated and inaccessible areas like Battgram, Balakot, and Allai.  The provincial and federal government should, however, also be able to provide assistance to less affected areas.  They called on the provincial government to do more to provide emergency shelter and financing for rebuilding.  They also requested government assistance in re-designing houses to prevent collapse in the future.  No village elders directly requested USG assistance, instead seeking our help in pressing the provincial and federal government to do more. At a lunch attended by the Brigadier commanding the NCO school at Shinkiari, villagers expressed gratitude for Pakistan Army efforts to assist.  They requested help, however, in obtaining victim registration cards, which would allow them to obtain assistance at Army supply distribution centers.  Most claimed that their villages had been bypassed by Army damage surveyors who had issued the cards.  The Brigadier promised to raise the problem with superiors.  5.  (U)  OIC asked villagers about the role of secular opposition parties in providing aid to their areas.  Elders claimed that neither the ANP nor the PPP had been seen.  Both appeared only at election time and had no real grassroots base in the area.  The somewhat surprising beneficiary of this political vacuum is a little-known local party - the Hazara Quami Movement (HQM).  Financed by an expatriate local who lives most of the time in the United States, HQM has established relief camps near the area, and its graffiti has begun to appear throughout Mansehra and Battgram.  HQM's calls for increased autonomy for the three Hazara districts of Abottabad, Mansehra, and Battgram appears to be gaining resonance.  Locals repeatedly cited neglect from Peshawar and Islamabad as the reasons for their growing sympathy towards the HQM.  6. (SBU)  Comment:  The lack of assistance to villages in this part of Mansehra is not unique.  NGOs are consistently finding pockets missed by initial surveys as they push further into Mansehra and Battgram districts.  Anger at the provincial and civilian side of the federal governments is likely to persist absent a more proactive assistance program.  While we believe that the HQM fascination is likely to be short-lived, its underlying premises of neglect from Peshawar and the need for increased local control of resources may well endure.

From October 19 through November 13, a water and sanitation officer (WSO) was deployed to Pakistan as part of the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART).  Through numerous trips through affected areas; assessments, and interviews with representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials, and others, the USAID/DART WSO has determined that the greatest water and sanitation needs are in urban camps, particularly those in Muzaffarabad.  The lack of water and sanitation facilities in these camps places the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the camps at risk of acquiring sanitation-related diseases.  The U.N. Children,s Fund (UNICEF) and other relief groups are gradually addressing this critical issue, although progress is slow.  In rural areas, the water and sanitation situation is not ideal, but people appear better able to cope with existing conditions. The primary risk to the rural population is the damage to spring systems, which forces rural residents to obtain their water from contaminated streams.  The primary water and sanitation intervention in rural areas is the distribution of hygiene kits and individual water purification materials.  In rural areas with denser populations, the quick repair of heavily used spring systems is necessary.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Coordination of Water and Sanitation Interventions --------------------------------------------- -----  2.  The coordination of water and sanitation interventions is being conducted at the five humanitarian hubs:  Mansehra, Balakot, Batagram, Muzaffarabad, and Bagh.  Overall water and sanitation coordination is being conducted out of Islamabad. The following information is based on site visits made from October 22 through November 9.  --------------------------------------------- ---- Islamabad: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------- ----  3.  At the national level, water and sanitation activities focus on acquiring and delivering resources to implementers at the humanitarian hubs, developing a national disaster strategy, and allocating UNICEF human water and sanitation resources.  At present, the critical resource shortage is the limited supply of latrine slabs.  However, the USAID/DART has purchased plywood for the U.S. Navy Construction Battalion,s (Seabees) construction projects in earthquake-affected areas.  Additionally, UNICEF has investigated numerous options to resolve the shortage, including procuring locally manufactured sheet metal slabs, obtaining plastic latrine slabs manufactured in Dubai, arranging for the local manufacture of plywood slabs, and accessing slab construction materials.  UNICEF is aggressively addressing this issue.  4.  UNICEF has developed an immediate water and sanitation relief strategy that involves four major interventions.  The first is the delivery of hygiene kits with basic instructions to rural populations.  Where feasible, rural gravity-flow spring systems will be repaired.  Where this is not feasible, individual water purification supplies will be provided to families.  The second intervention is providing basic water and sanitation interventions to residents of spontaneous camps in urban areas.  Basic interventions proposed include providing a chlorinated water supply, simple pit latrines designated by sex, hygiene kits for each family, and rudimentary solid waste collection.  The third intervention is providing water and sanitation interventions in planned camps.  Given the more permanent nature of planned camps, proposed interventions include potable water sources on site, pour flush latrines designated by sex, washing areas designated by sex, hygiene kits for each family, and solid waste collection.  The fourth intervention is coupling simple, standard hygiene education programs with all water and sanitation interventions delivered to affected populations.  5.  UNICEF is actively recruiting and assigning water and sanitation professionals for the relief effort.  UNICEF water and sanitation professionals who deployed at the beginning of the relief effort are due to return to their permanent positions.  UNICEF says it will replace them with locally recruited staff.  6.  The USAID/DART will continue to monitor UNICEF,s progress in resolving the latrine supply issue.  UNICEF has requested that USAID provide 10,000 sheets of marine-grade three-quarter-inch plywood and plans to construct latrine slabs from the plywood.  The USAID/DART has sourced a local supply of marine-grade plywood for the Seabees and UNICEF.  7.  The USAID/DART will also monitor UNICEF,s replacement of field staff.  Failure of UNICEF to replace field personnel in a timely manner will result in disruption of water and sanitation coordination activities at the humanitarian hubs.  --------------------------------------------- ------- Muzaffarabad: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------- -------  8.  The USAID/DART WSO reported that UNICEF is coordinating water and sanitation activities in the Muzaffarabad humanitarian hub, where water and sanitation cluster meetings are held twice weekly.  Addressing unacceptable water and sanitation conditions in the urban tent camps is the priority water and sanitation issue in the region around Muzaffarabad.  The Muzaffarabad city water plant is operating, and the water distribution system is functioning. Tanker trucks are delivering water to tent camps.  9.  In the Muzaffarabad urban area, over 19 camps are a temporary home to more than 10,000 people.  With many residential, government, and retail structures destroyed, Muzaffarabad city sustained extensive damage in the earthquake.  While drinking water has been provided in the tent camps, sanitation conditions in the camps have been neglected.  The poor sanitation conditions in the urban camps are due to several factors:  the lack of camp managers and latrine slabs, limited water and sanitation human resources among the relief agencies due to NGO focus on rural areas, and the failure of NGOs to monitor and ensure proper maintenance of the urban camp latrines.  10.  Recent outbreaks of diarrhea in urban camps have brought increased attention and resources to bear on improving sanitation conditions in urban camp areas.  The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, USAID, and the rest of the relief community are actively working to improve sanitation conditions in urban camps.  The relief community is refurbishing or replacing latrines.  UNICEF has coordinated the reassessment of the urban camps, using a survey tool approved by the water and sanitation cluster group.  The reassessment will allow the cluster group to appropriately target resources and water and sanitation interventions.  11.  Water and sanitation interventions in rural areas of Muzaffarabad District are limited to providing basic hygiene items and dispatching emergency response teams.  These joint WHO/UNICEF teams take specimens to investigate the cause of severe diarrhea cases, provide water purification materials, and conduct basic hygiene education.  12.  The USAID/DART will closely monitor water and sanitation activities in urban camps in Muzaffarabad and, when possible, provide technical support.  The Seabees, construction of latrines and latrine slabs for urban camps is an excellent example of directing U.S. military assets towards addressing critical needs.  --------------------------------------------- --- Mansehra: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------- ---  13.  Mansehra city was not as severely damaged by the earthquake as was Muzaffarabad.  Because the urban population in Mansehra was not heavily impacted, sanitation in urban camps, while an important issue, is not a priority.  Rather, the priority in the region is the water and sanitation issues at planned camps in the area.  The GOP military has assumed responsibly for management in many camps.  Unfortunately, camp managers have allowed IDPs to settle in these camps prior to the completion of the camp infrastructure.  This has led to rapid unplanned construction of inadequate water and sanitation facilities.  The cluster group in Mansehra focuses much of its efforts on responding to the water and sanitation needs in these camps.  14.  In Mansehra District, UNICEF has assumed responsibility for coordination of the water and sanitation sector. However, UNICEF appears to be more a passive participant than the coordinating agency.  In Mansehra, the water and sanitation cluster meeting occurs twice weekly and is led by the Mansehra District Water, Environmental, and Sanitation Department (WES) manager.  Water and sanitation cluster meetings focus primarily on water and solid waste.  When the USAID/DART WSO asked the WES manager whether latrine-related issues were ever discussed at these meetings, the WES manager stated that Oxfam was building   latrines.  Oxfam told the USAID/DART WSO that they were building latrines but that the latrine construction program was poorly coordinated and NGO resources were scarce.  15.  In Mansehra District, the local Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program has identified a total of 107 camps, each of which has more than 20 tents.  Of these 107 camps, the cluster group is focusing its efforts on 47 camps designated by the government as critical camps.  IDP camps in Mansehra region are in rural areas and appear to have adequate space for planned sanitation facilities.  16.  According to UNICEF, the UNICEF Hygiene Promotion Specialist for Mansehra District held a Hygiene Program training on November 12 and 13.  NGO hygiene promotion specialists attended the training, where they were trained on implementing a standardizeD hygiene promotion program.  17.  The USAID/DART has encouraged the water and sanitation cluster in Mansehra meeting to include latrine construction activities in its meeting agenda.  The USAID/DART has also encouraged the establishment of a latrine working group, if time constraints do not allow this issue to be discussed at the regular cluster meeting.  Such a group could tackle latrine construction issues and report at the water and sanitation cluster meeting.  18.  The USAID/DART closely monitors progress on the development of water and sanitation in planned camps.  It is highly likely that camp managers will allow tent camps to become overpopulated.  If the USAID/DART determines that the population of a camp is overloading the camp,s sanitation facilities, the team can take immediate action to encourage the camp management to stop settlement in the camp or, if possible, increase the number of sanitation facilities in the camp.  --------------------------------------------- --- Batagram: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------- ---  19.  In Batagram District, the earthquake significantly damaged rural homes.  However, Batagram town itself does not appear to be severely damaged.  The commercial district of Batagram does not appear to have sustained significant damage.  Local shops are open, and business appears brisk. The Batagram city water plant is functioning.  Only one major urban camp with approximately 100 tents was observed in Batagram city.  The USAID/DART WSO received reports that residents of this camp were IDPs from the hills surrounding the town.  20.  UNICEF is coordinating water and sanitation sector issues in Batagram District.  Water and sanitation cluster meetings are held twice weekly.  The priority water and sanitation issue in Batagram District is increasing NGO presence in the region and at Mehra tent camp, located one hour north of Batagram on the Indus River.  The GOP is planning Mehra tent camp to accommodate 40,000 IDPs, who the GOP expects will arrive from higher elevations in the Allai Valley.  In Mehra tent camp, Save the Children/US has done an excellent job providing basic sanitation interventions in a timely manner as residents have begun to arrive at the camp. The Austrian Red Cross is providing safe water at the camp.  21.  In rural areas of Batagram District, the water and sanitation priority is the delivery of hygiene kits and water purification supplies to remote areas.  22.  As in Mansehra, the USAID/DART will closely monitor progress on the development of water and sanitation in planned camps in Batagram District.  It is likely that camp managers will allow overpopulation of tent camps if left unmonitored.  If the USAID/DART determines that the population of a camp is overloading the camp,s sanitation facilities, the team will take immediate action to encourage the camp management to stop settlement in the camp or, if possible, expand the camp,s sanitation facilities.  --------------------------------------------- -- Balakot: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------- --  23.  A town of approximately 50,000 people, Balakot was completely destroyed by the earthquake.  Local NGOs reported an 80% fatality rate in the urban area.  The lack of large numbers of urban camps in the city of Balakot supports this figure.  The absence of urban IDPs may also be the result of previous residents evacuating Balakot city.  24.  ACTED reported that in Balakot, the GOP military is coordinating relief operations, and Action Contre la Faim (ACF) is holding informal water and sanitation coordination meetings.  Representatives of ACF stated that they are constructing 100 latrines per week for the IDPs located in Balakot.  ACF is combining the latrine construction ) the informal sector priority in Balakot ) with a hygiene promotion program.  In Balakot, the German Red Cross is providing clean water  25.  In rural areas of Balakot, the water and sanitation priorities are repairing gravity-flow spring systems in valleys north of Balakot and supplying remote rural residents with hygiene kits.  26.  The USAID/DART is encouraging UNICEF to place a water and sanitation professional in Balakot to coordinate sector activities and assist NGOs with the implementation of water and sanitation interventions.  UNICEF must take an active role in the coordination of water and sanitation activities in the area, as the Balakot water and sanitation sector cannot be effectively managed from Mansehra, as is currently the case.  -------------------------------------------- Bagh: Current Water and Sanitation Situation --------------------------------------------  27.  The USAID/DART WSO visited Bagh but had insufficient time to assess the area.  Like Balakot, Bagh is a small rural community.  Although the town sustained significant damage, businesses appeared to be operating.  The displaced urban population did not appear to have access to latrines. Displaced urban residents are living in spontaneous camps along a mountain stream and at a larger camp near the center of town.  UNICEF is the lead water and sanitation sector coordinator in Bagh.  Cluster meeting are held regularly but meeting dates and times were not available at the time of the visit. CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 ISLAMABAD 017267  SIPDIS  DEPARTMENT PLS PASS USAID MANILA PLS PASS USADB  E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11/20/2015 TAGS: EAID, ECON, PK, PREL, SENV SUBJECT:  SUCCESSFUL DONOR CONFERENCE GIVES MAJOR BOOST MUSHARRAF AND U.S. IMAGE  CLASSIFIED BY:  DSCG 05/01 JANUARY 2005, EDITION 1, REASON: 1.4(D)  1.  (SBU)  summary and comment.  The Musharraf Government is basking in the glow of a successful November 19 donor reconstruction conference that raised $6.0 billion (GOP's current internal figure, as of November 21 evening) in pledges for earthquake reconstruction, comfortably in excess of both the World Bank/ADB needs assessment estimate (of $5.2 billion) and the GOP's own estimates of its likely take going in (closer to $3.5-4.0 billion).  The largest pledges at the conference (preliminary figures including both new commitments and previously announced commitments) were:  World Bank:  $1 billion; Asian Development Bank:  $1 billion; United States:  $510 million; Saudi Arabia: $420-573 million (depending on whether export credits are included); Islamic Development Bank:  $502 million; China:  $326 million; and Iran:  $200 million.  While most major bilateral donations came from OECD countries and the Gulf states, Musharraf made a point of praising the (smaller) donations and participation of regional neighbors including India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan.  2.  (U)   President Musharraf outlined a blueprint for reconstruction that contained:  a plan to give cash grants to owners to rebuild their houses (with guidance to make them earthquake proof); plans to rebuild and improve the education and health systems in the affected areas; a GOP initiative to make facilities like schools or hospitals or even entire villages or tehsils (boroughs) open to "sponsorship" by donors from within Pakistan and abroad; and an announcement that Pakistan woul create a permanent volunteer corps to build on the spirit of voluntaris evident in the earthquake aftermath.   3.  (C)  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) and media are characterizing the conference as a tremendous success that reflects how Pakistan's post-9/11 foreign policy has ended the country's international isolatio and brought it the support of the rest of the world. The substantial U.S. contribution of $510 million (which is one of the two largest bilateral contributions, along with that of Saudi Arabia) has been singled out for special praise by Musharraf and the media.  Privately, GOP interlocutors from Musharraf and Aziz on down have note a pledge of this magnitude will do much to change America's image in Pakistan, while Aziz and others have also thanked us for U.S. efforts to encourage other donors to make robust pledges.  4.   (SBU)  In coming days, post will try to obtain the GOP's final tally of the pledges made at the conference (including trying to determine where U.S. encouragement for rapid disbursement may be productive) as well as ascertain further details on the reconstruction program sketched out by Musharraf at the conference.  5.  (C)  Comment:  the substantial U.S. pledge for reconstruction, following on the momentum generated by our pivotal role in the earthquake relief effort, has given us a rare opportunity to reshape public perceptions of America here in Pakistan, and to diminish the appeal of extremism more generally.  Our efforts have led to real changes in attitudes and behavior, not just among GOP interlocutors but also among the Pakistani public and media.  Post is working now on ways we can consolidate and build on those gains.  End comment and summary.  The donor conference:  pledges of $6 billion 6.  (U)  After a brief introductory video (in which the image of a big American flag hanging across the interior of a relief helicopter was th only image of a foreign flag), and brief introductory remarks by Conference Chair PM Shaukat Aziz and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, President Musharraf delivered the keynote address, laying out Pakistan's detailed blueprint for post-earthquake reconstruction. Among the highlights, he: -  Thanked the 75 countries and organizations represented at the conference, and singled out for special thanks the participation of India; -  Outlined the scope of the devastation (73,00 people died; an equal number seriously injured; 400,000 households affected, affecting 3.5 million people; an entire generation of children in the affected areas lost in collapsed schools); -  Praised the quick response of the Pakistani people and army, and explained that Pakistan had launched a national volunteer movement to tap into the energy of young Pakistanis who had voluntarily left their jobs to help with rescue operations;  -  Expressed the "deep gratitude of the Pakistani people" to the foreign participants in the rescue operation, and praised as "massive" the foreign support to the relief operation; -  Outlined the steps being taken to address the challenges of the relief operation (logistics, shelter, economy) and updated the "on the whole satisfactory" progress made to date. -  Explained that in order to restart economic activity to the region, the GOP would, by the end of November, pump 20 billion rupees ($350 million) in the local economies, giving 100,000 rupees ($1667) to the next of kin of those killed in the quake, 50,000 rupees ($833) to the seriously wounded; 25,000 ($417) to the less seriously wounded; and 25,000 ($417) rupees to each of the 400,000 affected households. -  Noted that in the needs assessment agreed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the GOP, $3.5 billion would be for reconstruction; $1.6 billion would be to sustain the relief operation for the coming year; and $100 million would be for rehabilitation efforts; -  Explained that for the 400,000 homes destroyed or seriously damaged by the earthquake, Pakistan would use an owner-driven approach, with each household receiving $3300 dollars to rebuild, and receiving guidance from military engineers and the new national volunteer corps o how to make the new homes earthquake proof. Musharraf noted the GOP's goal would be to complete the reconstruction of homes by the end of 2006.  Given the demand for construction material, some may be sourced from abroad and paid for by assistance pledges. -  Explained the GOP would be encouraging sponsorship of specific reconstruction projects by donors (both within Pakistan and from abroad).  Information on specific projects open for sponsorship would b available on a GOP website; -  For housing, a village cluster of 100 houses could be sponsored for $330 K, and for that sum the village would be named after the sponsor (Musharraf noted the Pakistan still has major cities like Abbotabad and Jacobabad named after their founders). Sponsoring home reconstruction throughout an entire tehsil (borough) would cost $50 million; sponsoring home reconstruction throughout an entire provincial district would cost $150 million. -  Explained that the GOP would prefer that sponsorship be applied to health and education facilities.  For housing, rather than have direct sponsorship by donors or self- construction by donors -- both of which could lead to disparities in housing levels (and/or unsuitable housing) -- the GOP would prefer that money be contributed to the President's Relief Fund from which it will be used to finance owner-driven housing reconstruction. -  Said that the education infrastructure in the affected areas would be rebuilt in a manner that is modular and earthquake proof, and would be rebuilt with a goal of universalizing education in the affected area (this meant the GOP's estimate for the cost of reconstructing the education system in the affected areas was $614 million, or roughly 30 percent higher than the $472 million figure cited in the needs assessment); -  Said that for the health sector, rebuilding in line with needs (rather than simply duplicating the facilities destroyed in the earthquake) would come to $412 million, or roughly 36 percent more than the figure cited in the needs assessment (to rebuild earlier facilities). -  Explained that in order to protect destitute women, the orphaned, and disabled (the rehabilitation phase), the Ministry of Social Welfare would create rehabilitation centers modeled on the Ashyana (nest) project in Hattian, and in order to generate economic activity there would encourage microfinance (including the Khushalli Bank of Pakistan) and skill development by NGOs and volunteer groups. -  Appealed to Pakistanis both within Pakistan and throughout the world to donate generously, sponsoring the reconstruction of facilities or even "adopting" entire villages, tehsils, or districts.   (Later in the conference it was explained a subsequent donor conference would be held to raise reconstruction funds from domestic and expatriate Pakistanis.) -  Assured that the reconstruction plan, and the receipt and disbursement of funds, would be implemented in a transparent manner, an be monitored by both external auditors and an oversight committee of eminent persons.  Committees comprised of parliamentarians, local government and military representatives would oversee local-level disbursement of funds. -  Appealed to India, "to the government of Indian Held Kashmir ... to the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and other Kashmiri groups" to work together to turn the earthquake into an opportunity to improve Indo-Pak relations and solve the Kashmir dispute.  This, he said, could be "India's donation" to the earthquake relief effort.  7.  (SBU).  Prime Minister Aziz closed the conference by noting his quick calculation indicated that pledges of assistance were received fo $5.4 billion, in excess of the $5.2 billion figure cited in the needs assessment (and closer to the GOP's own calculation that rebuilding the health and education systems in the affected areas with necessary improvements would push the total reconstruction cost to $6 billion). November 20 Pakistani press reports cited a figure of $5.8 billion.  These numbers seem to include both new pledges and previous pledges, as most donors did in their presentations (an unconfirmed November 21 press report said the conference raised $3.4 billion in new assistance), and include grant and loan assistance; it i not clear whether all pledges (e.g., export credits, IMF emergency loan are included in these initial tallies.   The GOP's Economic Affairs Division, which handles foreign assistance issues, is still compiling final figures, which Embassy will report septel.  On November 21 evening, GOP contacts told us their current internal calculation -- still preliminary --is that the pledges made at the conference totaled $6 billion, of which roughly $3.6 billion were new pledges (and $2.4 billion were pledges announced previously).  8.  (U)  Individual donors made the following pledges (NOTE:  this reflects initial numbers committed by delegates to the conference, as recorded by embassy notetaker and the press, with additional details as available). -  World Bank (represented by Praful Patel, Vice President, South Asia region):  $1 billion -  Asian Development bank (Haruhiko Kuroda, President): $1 billion; -  United States (USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios):  $510 million; -  Saudi Arabia:  $593 million (of which $133 million grants, $187 concessional loans, $120 million in private donations, and $153 in export credits, which are not usually counted as assistance); -  Islamic Development Bank (Ahmed Mohamed Ali, President):  $502 million (reflecting an additional $250 million that IDB management will propose to the IDB board, on top of $252 previously committed); -  IMF (Iqbal Zaidi, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director): reiterated offer of $375 million loan for balance of payments support (NOTE:  GOP contacts told us this number was not being included in the final tally of assistance pledges); -  China (Wu Dawei, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs):  press reports $326 million (of which the majority is a new $300 million concessional loan); -  Iran (Mohammed Saeedi Kia, Miinister for Housing and Urban Development):  $200 million (in medium term credits); -  Turkey (Mehmet Ali Sahin, Deputy PM and Minister of State):  $150 million (appears this was previously announced); -  France (Philippe Douste-Blazy, Minister for Foreign Affairs):  $124 million (of which $94 million in new concessional loans on top of $30 million previously announced); -  United Kingdom (Gareth Thomas, Deputy Minister of International Development): $120 million in new contributions; -  Japan (Yasuhisa Shiozaki, Senior Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs):  $120 million ($100 million in new yen loans on top of $20 million in grant aid previously announced); -  European Commission (Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner):  $110 million in grants (not clear if this figure includes Commission assistance previously announced); -  Germany (Ambassador Gunter Mulack):  $100 million (in a new package of commitments agreed November 16.  This appears to be on top of earlie contributions of $31 million from the German Government and $24 million from private donations in Germany); -  UAE (Ali Bin Abdullah Al-Kaabi, Minister for Labor):  $100 million (previously announced); -  Kuwait:  $100 million (previously announced); -  Netherlands (Ambassador Willem Andreae):  has pledged over $72 million so far, and will consider additions to that when Development Minister visits Pakistan in two weeks; -  Norway:  $70 million (Government will ask Parliament for an additional $35 million on top of $35 already spent; will also consider debt swap). Other countries announcing contributions included:  Indonesia; Azerbaijan, Australia (which will announce a new assistance package during Prime Minister Howard's upcoming visit);  Jordan; Bangladesh ($2 million); Afghanistan; India (re-affirmed Geneva pledge of $25 million in export credits); Ireland; Italy; Malaysia (additional $1 million on top of 3.3. million in cash and kind previously pledged); Cuba, Sweden (additional $20 million in grants over three years on top of $25 million already pledged); Korea; Morocco; Thailand (additional $300 K on top of previous commitment of $250 K); Denmark ($18.5 million total to date, and considering more); Switzerland ($40 million over five years, plus several million in private donations from Swiss citizens); Bhutan; Czech Republic; Spain; Singapore; Canada; Greece.  The reaction:  praise for Musharraf, Aziz ... and the United States   9.  (C)  The GOP has publicly termed the conference a big success, and has privately told us they were elated by the strong showing since they went into the conference knowing of only $3.5 billion in pledges.  President Musharraf was quoted as telling the press the results showed Pakistan enjoyed the respect of the world community, was not in isolation, and would be receiving help from around the world to help rebuild.  At his luncheon following the conference, Musharraf said (this was subsequently released to the press):  "I would be remiss if I did not single out some countries who have been particularly generous.  And in this, I would like to pinpoint two countries who have exceeded $500 million dollars, that is, the United States of America and Saudi Arabia. We are extremely grateful to these countries for contributing so much to us."  (Musharraf also singled out for thanks countries that pledged more than $100 million --  the United Kingdom, German, UAE, Kuwait, and European Union/Commission -- and the World Bank, ADB and Islamic Development Bank.)  At the luncheon, Musharraf privately asked the USDel to express thanks to President Bush and said U.S. generosity at the conference would have a lasting positiv impact on America's image in Pakistan in a way that an incremental approach would not have.  Prime Minister Aziz also thanked the USDel for the significant U.S. pledge, which he said helped set the tone for the entire conference, and he also expressed appreciation for U.S. efforts to encourage other donors (the Japanese delegation and ADB delegation each also noted that U.S. encouragement had been helpful to efforts to strengthen their contributions).  10.  (U)  Media reaction to the November 19 conference has been uniformly positive, both for the GOP and for the United States.  In a November 20 editorial, the Dawn (Pakistan's leading English language daily) said the conference resulted in "an encouraging pledge of $5.8 billion ... [which] should serve to cheer up a government that had been fighting with its back to the wall and facing intense criticism from the opposition [for slowness of relief operations]," and stated "The U.S. is the single biggest donor country, having increased its contribution to $510 million (including money already given)."  [NOTE:  the Dawn editorial reported the Saudi contribution as $391 million, which apparently leaves out the $153 million in export credits and some other part of the Saudi aid package.]  The November 20 "The News" had the front-page headline "PM basks in 'foreign policy success' and quoted PM Aziz as saying the conference results demonstrated that "The foreign policy being pursued by President General Pervez Musharraf has started showing results;" other articles in the News called the Saturday conference "a celebration of Pakistan's foreign policy." On November 21, the Daily Times had an editorial (headline:  "World Rallies around Pakistan") noting the earlier decision of opposition parties' (ARD and MMA) to stay away from the conference, said there was "definitely an incomprehensible sense of dismay in thE opposition camp at the success of the government to get the world together." The editorial continued, "In the final tally of aid pledges, there are a few surprises for the pessimists and for those who think that Pakistan's post-9/11 foreign policy has isolated the country instead of bringing it in tune with the rest of the world. The U.S., together with Saudi Arabia, is at the top of the list of countries in bilateral pledges.... The American pledge of half a billio dollars has come in the wake of opinion surveys in Pakistan saying 90 percent of the respondents hated President Bush and loved Osama bin Laden and that Al Qaeda was not responsible for 9/11 attacks."  11.  (U)  The Urdu press has been equally upbeat about the donor conference results.  The leading mass circulation daily "Jang" in a Monday editorial called the conference results "not only testimony of the success of the efforts of President Musharraf and PM Shaukat Aziz but also a reflection of trust in the government's efforts for the rehabilitation" of quake-affected areas and people.  The second highest circulation daily "Nawa-e-Waqt" noted "Among those provided the most ai are the World bank, Asian Development Bank, America and Saudi Arabia."  A Monday editorial in the Urdu daily "Din" stated "It is worth mentioning here that the U.S. increased its assistance three-fold, raising the final figure to $510 million out of which 300 million would be provided in cash."  The populist Urdu daily "Khabrain" stated in a November 21 editorial, "The international community's response has been beyond Pakistan's expectations.  Undoubtedly, President Musharraf and PM Aziz deserve praise for organizing this conference, although some circles in Pakistan were creating the impression that the international community was not interested in helping Pakistan."  The center-right daily "Pakistan," in a November 21 editorial, said "America has announced the most aid in the Donors Conference, which is approximately $510 million.  American Congress had urged the Administration to increase it to one billion.... The Government can rightly feel proud of the outcome of the conference... America and its allies have lent wholehearted support to their ally Pakistan; it is also a reflection of the confidence reposed in Presiden Musharraf."  12.  (SBU)  By November 21, print media had begun to give some space to (inside) stories reporting opposition parties' criticism that the donor conference has not been as great a success as asserted since much of th assistance is being provided in the form of loans, which will ultimatel increase Pakistan's debt burden (Note:  no individual country's assistance is referenced in these stories.  It is post's understanding that the U.S. $510 million aid package is likely to be al in grants or in-kind).  Next steps   13.  (SBU)  In the coming days, post will try to obtain the GOP's final tally of the pledges made at the conference (including trying to determine where U.S. encouragement for rapid disbursement may be productive).  Post will also try to obtain further details on the reconstruction program sketched out by Musharraf at the conference, and try to pinpoint how the various components of the U.S. assistance pledg (USAID funds and programs, DOD support, and private sector financing) can be most effective.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ISLAMABAD 017311  SIPDIS  DEPT PASS TO USAID  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, ECON, PHUM, PK, AORC, UN, Earthquake SUBJECT: SIX WEEKS AFTER PAKISTAN'S EARTHQUAKE:  ASSESSING THE UN'S PERFORMANCE   Summary -------   1.   With few exceptions, UN agencies were inadequate to the task in the weeks immediately following Pakistan's earthquake.  In some cases they remain so.  Certainly the challenges have been great, involving overwhelming needs, difficult terrain, multiple donors and the need to work closely with Pakistani leaders and agencies that were initially uncertain and uncoordinated.  That said, some UN agencies have been remarkably slow to adapt, despite the obvious urgency as winter conditions set in.  Because these agencies are responsible for coordinating donor activities in their sectors, these shortcomings have had a cascading impact on the effectiveness of other relief operations operating in affected sectors.  NGOs working in the field have been frustrated by sometimes interminable discussions on minutiae and have pushed hard for better UN leadership.  Overall Assessment ------------------  2.  This cable is based on observations in Islamabad and the field by Embassy staff and USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and reflects numerous meetings with UN representatives and NGO implementing partners.  3.  The UN was late in appreciating that a second disaster was looming after the initial search and rescue phase -- specifically that hundreds of thousands, if not millions would require shelter assistance to survive the harsh Himalayan winter.  In contrast to many NGOs, the UN was slow to provide funding and deploy qualified personnel and assets in response this threat.  One UN employee characterized the UN response to date as a "disgusting operation" and a "pathetic show."  His view, almost one month after the earthquake, was that UN agencies did not generally send their best people.  The UN also had initial difficulties in dealing with Pakistani authorities, though coordination improved after the GOP established the Federal Relief Commission (FRC) as the coordination entity for disaster response.  While the performance of UN agencies improved over time, their failures in the early weeks suggest they are not equipped to deal with crises like this one, where lives depend on a rapid response.   4.  The UN and its defenders assert that UN agencies were inadequately funded and that performance improved as funds came in.  There is some truth to this, but we note that on October 12 (four days after the earthquake) the U.S. disbursed two million dollars each to UNICEF and WHO, three million to IOM and almost four million to WFP ($3.5 million for air operations and $300,000 for the Joint Logistics Center).   U.S. NGOs that were provided similar sums a few days later have much more to show for their efforts in terms of impact on the ground.  (Though in fairness, these NGOs were able to focus more exclusively on relief delivery and in some cases had more latent in-country capacity.)  5.  Beginning at para 10 below, we rank the key UN agencies on their performance over the first month following the disaster, with the strongest performers first and the weakest last.   We acknowledge an inherent degree of unfairness in this ranking as UN agencies are not funded equally; it is probably no coincidence that WHO and UNICEF, the best funded agencies, get the best marks.  Moreover, the varying sectors in which UN agencies operate also vary in complexity.  Donor Coordination ------------------  6.  The UN was quick to assume leadership of Islamabad-based "clusters" that seek to coordinate emergency response in various sectors.  However, in most sectors there have been too few qualified UN personnel on the ground to provide effective leadership, and little vertical coordination between the clusters in Islamabad and corresponding ones in the field.  As such, the overall effectiveness of the UN, both in field operations and in providing technical advice to NGOs and the GOP, has been limited.  There has been a general disconnect between Pakistani Government and NGO activities, and while the UN is not entirely responsible, more effective UN coordination could have helped considerably.  USAID NGO implementing partners are fairly unanimous in their concern with the poor performance (and in some cases, total absence) of the UN in humanitarian relief efforts.  7.  The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been heading donor coordination meetings in Islamabad since the day after the earthquake.   In early November (following guidance provided by US and UK reps) OCHA dispatched a Senior Humanitarian Advisor, Kevin Kennedy, to more effectively pull together the efforts of different agencies.  Kennedy, a former U.S. Marine officer with extensive disaster coordination experience, has been a welcome addition, and recognizes the leading role the Pakistani military must play.  His initial assessment was that coordination in Islamabad lagged well behind coordination in the field and indications are that he has already reduced the disparity in the weeks since he arrived.  8.  In the field, UN Disaster Assistance Coordination (UNDAC) teams were sent to coordinate the initial donor response. The U.S. Forward Operating Base in Mansehra gives UNDAC good marks for its work in the NWFP.  OCHA is now assuming this coordination function from UNDAC and the transition seems to be proceeding smoothly.  However, while the UN's coordination efforts in the field under UNDAC and OCHA seem to be reasonably strong, they have not succeeded in improving the implementation record of other UN agencies.  9.  Soon after the operation began, the UN established a HIC (Humanitarian Information Center), collocated with OCHA at the UNICEF building in Islamabad.  The HIC has provided some useful maps and contact information, but has generally been in a passive mode, receiving information from clusters and NGOs rather than proactively seeking information on concentrations of vulnerable people and field conditions. HIC staff in Pakistan were largely trained in an operations model for working in slow-onset, complex humanitarian disaster and have not yet adjusted to the need to work in the compressed time scale of a natural disaster.  WHO ---  10.  The World Health Organization (WHO) could have done more to promptly address dangerously unsanitary conditions in Muzzafarabad camps, but overall it gets good marks, both in coordinating the health cluster and in addressing needs on the ground.  WHO continues to provide disease surveillance through 29 reporting sites, diligently quashing unconfirmed rumors of epidemic outbreaks while continuing to monitor for important indicative diseases such as cholera.  It has helped restart health facilities that were damaged by the earthquake, through provision of tents, mobile units, medicines and medical supplies, and conducted with UNICEF a mass measles vaccination campaign for those between 6 months to 15 years old.  No massive outbreak has broken out in any of the camps or settlements, indicating that the vaccination has been generally successful.  11.  WHO was the first and only UN agency to deploy to hard-hit Balakot, where it has been a continuing presence for over two weeks now, coordinating with the NGOs and monitoring health trends in the area.   Under WHO leadership, the health cluster group in Mansehra is working well together to cover health needs and gaps in assistance for the affected population, and is trying to increase collaboration between emergency care and medical practitioners who will eventually take over the long-term care for these patients.  UNICEF ------  12.  NGO representatives throughout the affected area say UNICEF is performing reasonably well as the lead agency for water and sanitation, protection, education and nutrition. UNICEF has done an adequate job in the water and sanitation area, developing  a comprehensive relief strategy involving four major interventions, including hygiene kits for rural populations, basic interventions for residents of spontaneous camps in urban areas (chlorine tablets, simple pit latrines, hygiene kits, rudimentary waste collection), interventions in planned camps (potable water sources on site, pour flush latrines, washing areas, hygiene kits, waste collection), and standard hygiene education programs for all affected populations.  In Muzaffarabad, UNICEF has been aggressive in addressing the shortage of latrine slabs, purchasing plywood for the U.S. Navy Seabees projects, procuring locally manufactured sheet metal slabs, obtaining plastic slabs from Dubai, and arranging for local production of plywood slabs. The story is not as favorable in the NWFP, where its sanitation efforts have lagged.  (In Shangla District's Mehra camp, which houses 6,200 people, UNICEF has built only 20 pit latrines.) It has been less effective in coordinating the work of other NGOs in the field, which has led to a duplication of effort in several camps.  A lack of UNICEF leadership has also sometimes allowed Pakistan's Department of Water and Sanitation to steer donor funding toward a wishlist of long-standing water projects at the expense of crucial hygiene and sanitation efforts.  13.  UNICEF seems to be doing better in coordinating and implementing protection, education and nutrition programs  It has helped restart schools that were damaged by the earthquake by providing large tents and school supplies and working with NGOs to set up child-friendly spaces in camps. It has also offered psychological support to those traumatized by the disaster and disseminated health messages throughout the communities.  In addition, UNICEF working with WFP has distributed high energy biscuits to some 25,000 children through the school system, and has completed a nutrition survey training this month.  Assessments from the field suggest that UNICEF logistics personnel have been effective and energetic.  WFP ---  14.  The World Food Program (WFP), which chairs the logistics and food/transportation clusters, has a poor, but improving record.  On the logistics front, its initial efforts were weak but improved dramatically after the arrival of one of its most able people, Amer Daoudi, Chief of its Logistics Service in Rome.  WFP's role in this cluster is complex, in that it can directly task the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) which operates the helicopters leased by the UN, but not the UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC), an interagency body funded by separate contributions that oversees schedules and coordinates all modes of transport (ground, fixed wing aircraft, and helicopters).  15.  Field assessments of WFP's performance in the food cluster do not paint a favorable picture.  It has been slow in gathering information on where the NGOs are working and areas that are not being served.    NGOs have bitterly complained about the lack of coordination resulting in duplication of food distributions and competition for food supplies among NGOS.  While some of this can be blamed on NGOs, strong WFP leadership would certainly have led to a more effective and timely distribution of food resources.  UNJLC -----  16.  The performance of the UN Joint Logistics Center in coordinating transportation has been mixed.  Early in the operation there were a significant logistical problems in managing air cargoes arriving at Islamabad Airport.  These problems have receded somewhat with improved inventorying of incoming goods.  The most complex challenges in the logistics field have related to use of helicopter assets where UNJLC is not yet up to the task of coping with the numerous actors involved.  UNJLC is tasking not only the UNHAS helicopters, but also British helicopters, while the U.S. military is receiving helicopter taskings from the Pakistani military. As a result, too many missions have been flown to sites that were accessible by road, resulting in longer wait times for some NGO cargo that did actually need to move by air. In some cases UN pilots did not have proper maps or grid coordinates and were hampered by limited English language facility.  17.  The WFP's Amer Daoudi was instrumental in the recent establishment of a Joint Air Operations Center, in which the Pakistani military, UN, US, and other militaries would divide up necessary helicopter missions to avoid duplication and ensure all areas are reached.  UNHCR -----  18.  UNHCR is responsible for the camp management cluster, and of all the UN agencies, it has probably been the weakest performer.  In part this is because it conceives its role as planning and training -- equipping others to administer camps.  It has not adjusted easily to the existing emergency situation where lives are at stake and there is no time to train others to do the work.  (By the third week UNHCR had over 20 people working on earthquake relief in the NWFP, but the affected area in the NWFP is very large.)    In addition, UNHCR has been hampered by a lack of qualified personnel, effective leadership and limited resources on the ground. During a number of visits to the field, DART personnel encountered no UNHCR presence whatsoever, including in major tented camps.  Pakistani military representatives made reference to UNHCR driving through their areas of operation, talking briefly with them, and then leaving with no follow-up visits.   One DART field officer had a discussion with a UNHCR representative who was, nearly a month into the operation, unsure of the exact mandate of his agency, and the degree to which it should be involved in camp design and management.  Other UN representatives pointed out the need to push UNHCR to take a more active role in this area.  19.  In fairness, part of the difficulty was that UNHCR had to wait until the army and the government's Federal Relief Commission (FRC) provided sites.  The very rugged terrain of the affected area offers few flat areas, and some suitable sites are not available. Once sites were identified, the army often pitched tents without consulting anyone, making it necessary for UNHCR to work with the military to reconfigure the camp to make it meet appropriate standards for displaced people.   As with other UN agencies, UNHCR's early performance suffered because no government entity was speaking authoritatively for the GOP on relief plans.  The UN also had to adjust when the FRC made major changes to the shelter plan.   (Performance has improved recently as UNHCR has fielded additional staff, allowing it to dispatch quick impact teams to fix water, sanitation and other problems in camps.)  IOM --- 20.  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has failed to offer effective leadership for the critical shelter cluster.  It has adopted a facilitative, rather than a leadership role and was slow to establish effective avenues of cooperation with the GOP.  IOM has devoted considerable time and human and financial resources to field operations focused on the movement of supplies, which has diverted attention from the important task of strategically managing the Shelter Cluster.   NGOs in the NWFP complain that IOM employees are ineffectual and spend too much time collating databases instead of addressing urgent needs.    CROCKER 
UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 017384  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, AEMR, ASEC, MASS, ECON, PGOV, PREL, PK, Earthquake SUBJECT: PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE: THE SITUATION IN KOHISTAN    1. Summary:  Southern Kohistan fared somewhat better than neighboring provinces during the October 8 earthquake with only two subdistricts affected and comparatively less damage.  In terms of assistance, however, the 50-55% of the affected areas, population left homeless have fared far worse.  Only limited assistance has reached the area and corruption at the local and provincial government level has diverted needed resources.  International and national NGOs are entirely absent in the district,s Pattan subdistrict, and even the Islamist parties, which enjoy broad support in the district, have not initiated relief camps.  The Pakistan army is cognizant of the lack of aid, and has promised to divert additional resources, particularly shelter, to the area. Officials, however, stress that their impact will be limited without additional support from the UN and international NGOs.  End Summary.  2.  OIC, Emboff, and A/RSO visited the Pattan subdistrict in southern Kohistan on November 15 to review damage and assess relief and recovery operations in the area.  The earthquake in southern Kohistan was relatively less severe than in other areas of NWFP.  Most damage that we observed was caused by landslides that were triggered by the initial quake as opposed to the outright collapse of buildings that we have witnessed elsewhere.  While deaths were reportedly minimal (locals who are familiar with landslides took evasive action in the minutes after the quake which probably saved lives), injuries, particularly broken bones and contusions from falling rock were frequently observed.  Between 25,000 and 30,000 people (50-55% of the populations) were left homeless by the earthquake/landslide and significant damage was caused to the limited road network and electricity/communication infrastructure.  3.  Locals in Pattan subdistrict identified shelter as their priority need.  Absent assistance, they claimed that it will be impossible for many to survive the upcoming winter.  In their view, between 4000 and 5000 winterized tents or alternative shelters would be necessary to meet the need in this area.  Only a few hundred tents had arrived in the subdistrict.  Locals expressed a willingness to build alternative shelter if provided with needed tools, but were very concerned that it would be impossible to complete such shelters before significant snowfall began in the area.  4.  The equitable distribution of the limited available supplies within Kohistan was a significant concern.  Military relief flights have been turning over all goods to the local governments for distribution (in contrast to other areas where direct distribution by the military is the norm). Local military commanders attributed this decision to a lack of personnel to handle distributions unilaterally.  According to locals, the district, subdistrict, and union council nazims have been distributing supplies based on political and family affiliation rather than need.  For example, close relatives of the district nazim had been provided with several roles of plastic sheeting despite having suffered no damage to their houses.  That sheeting was now for sale in the local market.  In addition, locals claimed that the Provincial Revenue Minister had been channeling all provincial (and to the extent that he could) federal relief goods towards Palas subdistrict (his home constituency). They adamantly maintained that conditions in that subdistrict were far better than in theirs (due to time constraints, OIC could not visit Palas).  5.  Despite their concerns over distribution, locals were effusive in their praise for relief flights organized by the Pakistani and American militaries ) their only source of assistance to date.  In contrast, they were dismissive of UN entities and NGOs who they maintained had not been seen in the region.  OIC observed that northern Shangla and Kohistan were virtually devoid of the presence of any NGOs and IOs (in contrast to other areas where they are much in evidence). Similarly, locals were disappointed by the absence of relief efforts from Islamist parties in the district.  Neither JI nor JUI-F had relief camps in the Pattan subdistrict despite steadfast political support for these parties from locals. Locals claimed to be reevaluating whether these parties merited their support in future.  6.  The Pakistan military was aware of the serious deficit in relief supplies reaching southern Kohistan.  OIC spoke with NWFP Chief of Relief Operations, Maj. Gen. Shakil who was visiting the district by helicopter on the same day.  Shakil admitted that supplies had been inadequate, largely because the military had not previously obtained a clear picture of need in the area.  Shakil instructed his officers to send six relief flights per day to Pattan over the following week. Military officials in Mansehra claimed that a portion of those were sent but that they included largely food and NFIs not shelter.  Shakil stressed that absent an IO/NGO presence in the district, the army would be hard-pressed to meet the significant needs in the area.  7.  Comment: Due to the comparatively less damage in Kohistan, NGOs and IOs have yet to focus on this area.  While we agree that needs are unquestionably greater in other areas of the NWFP, complete neglect of this area is of significant concern, especially given the typically harsh winters and a lack of viable alternatives for most of the population.  The Pakistan military seems genuine in its desire to assist, but is also cognizant that its resources are limited and cannot meet the needs without outside assistance.  Nepotism has certainly complicated relief efforts in the area, but is likely an outgrowth of limited resources and may well evaporate with significant relief supplies.  We believe that additional focus on Kohistan needs to be a priority for the international community.  End Comment.  8. Embassy Islamabad is transmitting this cable on behalf of FOB Mansehra. CROCKER

With the onset of winter, some Pakistanis living at higher elevations are beginning to relocate temporarily to lower elevations.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) has received reports, however, of people moving not just from the mountains to camps at lower elevations, but also from the camps back up to the mountains.  Movement varies by district, as well as by location within the district.  This population movement is likely the result of a number of factors, including the need to find food and shelter during the winter months, Government of Pakistan (GOP) payments for earthquake-related losses, seasonal migration patterns, and the lack of basic services in some tent camps.  Agencies providing humanitarian aid must structure their programs to take into account population movement.  As additional information regarding population movements becomes available, the USAID/DART will adjust funding as necessary.  End summary.  ---------- Background ----------  2. With the onset of winter, some Pakistanis living at higher elevations are beginning to relocate temporarily to lower elevations.  The percentage of the population that relocates for the winter varies throughout the country.  The October 8 earthquake has disrupted typical movement patterns this year.  ----------------------------------- Movements of People within Pakistan -----------------------------------  3. The USAID/DART has received reports of people moving not just from the mountains to the camps but also from camps at lower elevations back up to the mountains.  Movement varies by district and location within the district.  On November 13, a representative of USAID/Pakistan reported that in Mansehra, approximately 90 percent of people from the northern Kaghan Valley intended to leave the valley within the week.  However, this pattern is a part of an annual migration pattern, as the winters at elevations in the northern Kaghan Valley are harsh.  Approximately 30 percent of people who live in the southern and central Kaghan Valley have already left their homes.  In some parts of Mansehra, up to half of the people who left in the aftermath of the earthquake have returned to their homes, and as of November 13, people living in this area continue to return.  In the Kala Dhaka Tribal Area, however, less than 5 percent of the population has left their homes as people in this area are essentially self-sufficient and typically do not leave home.  4. A representative of USAID/Pakistan reported that in Batagram tehsil, approximately 10 percent of people living in isolated areas have left for other locations.  Most of these people have joined family members elsewhere in Pakistan, and people who have not left have expressed an intention to remain.  5. In Allai tehsil, approximately 10 percent of the population has left for other locations, with most going to Mehra Tent Camp.  A USAID/Pakistan representative reported that as temperatures drop, more people will continue to leave their homes, although it is unlikely that 50 percent of the population in this area will leave, as the GOP military predicts.  -------------------------------- Reasons for Population Movements --------------------------------  6. Recent population movement in Pakistan is likely the result of a number of factors, although the most basic reason is to find shelter and food.  In addition, some individuals or families are likely moving in order to claim GOP payments for earthquake-related loss.  Further, seasonal migration is a traditional coping mechanism of many who live at higher altitudes.  The USAID/DART has also observed that in some areas of Pakistan, people living in tent camps have returned to the site of their former homes.  7. GOP Payments for Earthquake-Related Loss: One of the factors affecting Pakistanis' movements is the GOP's commitment to disburse funds to those affected by the earthquake.  On November 11, President Musharraf announced that the GOP would immediately disburse 100,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR), which is approximately USD 1,666, to the next of kin of those who died in the earthquake, PKR 50,000 (USD 833) to people injured in the earthquake, and PKR 25,000 (USD 416) to those whose houses were damaged or destroyed. According to a USAID/Pakistan representative in Mansehra, reports from the field suggest that the GOP's progress with the monetary distributions is mixed.  8. A USAID/Pakistan representative reported that in earthquake-affected areas, district governments have received funds to make payments for deaths of family members.  District governments are organizing payment disbursal.  Each district government appears to be disbursing funds differently.  Among districts, the progress at which disbursal is proceeding varies.  9. As of November 14, Pakistani citizens who lost property in the earthquake had not received compensation. Compensation for the loss of loved ones, however, was being paid in Abbottabad, Mansehra, Batagram, and Shangla. District officials who spoke with USAID claimed that payments will continue until the available GOP funds run out or all victims are compensated.  10. While some people can claim payments in camps, others are required to return to their villages to collect their compensation.  In Mansehra and Abbottabad, affected people can file a claim in any union council in the district. Before payment is made, the claim is verified against the record in the union council where the death occurred.  In Batagram, people filing a claim must do so in the union council where the death occurred.  Officials from Batagram district have stated that they have no way of cross-checking records from offices elsewhere in the district.  Payment is particularly complicated for those who have moved from Battgram's Allai Tehsil to Mehra Camp, which is located in the neighboring Shangla district.  Shangla claims that it will make immediate payments based on a death certificate issued within the district boundaries that identifies earthquake as the cause of death.  11. Seasonal Migration: The USAID/DART has received numerous reports that people in certain areas of Pakistan, especially Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), have two and sometimes three homes at varying altitudes.  This allows them to move to lower altitudes as temperatures drop.  The USAID/DART is unable to ascertain the extent to which current movement is part Pakistanis' annual migration patterns.  12. Lack of Basic Services in Tent Camps: The USAID/DART has received reports of individuals in tent camps returning to their home sites, even though the homes were damaged or destroyed.  At this time, the USAID/DART cannot definitively ascertain the reason for people's departure from camps to their home sites; however, the USAID/DART believes that this is likely due to lack of water and sanitation, shelter, food, or other basic services in certain camps.  ------------------------------- Implications for Relief Efforts -------------------------------  13. Because affected populations continue to be mobile more than a month after the October 8 earthquake, agencies providing humanitarian aid must structure programs to take into account this population movement.  The USAID/DART, GOP, and relief organizations are structuring relief efforts around a two-pronged strategy.  The USAID/DART, GOP and relief organizations are simultaneously delivering relief commodities to hard-to-reach areas in order to promote shelter in place.  At the same time, those providing humanitarian aid are also attempting to provide basic services to tent camps to encourage people in need of shelter to relocate temporarily to camps.  14. Through the use of its Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Coordinator from the interagency Humanitarian Information Unit of the State Department, the USAID/DART is also guiding partners to identify and assist areas of the greatest unmet needs.  The Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) established by the US military has provided the USAID/DART with maps, indicating areas where earthquake destruction, lack of road access, and population density intersect, which roughly represent areas of greatest unmet needs.  Supported by these maps and the GIS coordinator, the USAID/DART is strategically programming resources by guiding NGO partners to target assistance in the areas identified.  This critical collaboration among USG agencies and NGOs will enhance the impact and efficiency of USAID/DART program funds.  15. Through funding to its implementing partners, the USAID/DART follows this two-pronged strategy, both providing basic services to tent camps and delivering relief commodities in hard-to-reach areas.  The USAID/DART maintains that current programming must focus on supplying those who will stay at higher elevations with shelter or shelter materials, sufficient to protect them against the winter weather.  If many of the affected people do come into camps, the USAID/DART will adjust funding and shift program focus to camp situations if necessary.  The USAID/DART continues to monitor the movement of people within Pakistan. As additional information becomes available, the USAID/DART will adjust funding accordingly to ensure that assistance reaches affected communities.   CROCKER

Immediately following the October 8 earthquake, relief agencies concentrated efforts on providing affected populations with urgently needed humanitarian assistance and shelter to assure survival during the upcoming winter months.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team's (DART) program has provided robust support for these activities, but has also taken steps to promote livelihoods and market revitalization.  The USAID/DART has led this transition and to date, has provided approximately USD 4.5 million to seven NGO partners to implement cash-for-work (CFW), cash-for-training (CFT), and voucher activities.  The USAID/DART has collaborated closely with USAID/Pakistan to design, fund, and implement programs that can transition to longer-term, mission-supported programs.  End summary.  ---------- Background ----------  2. Since the October 8 earthquake, USAID, the Government of Pakistan (GOP), UN agencies, and NGOs have focused their efforts on emergency medical care, distribution of food and emergency relief supplies, and shelter activities to assure survival of the earthquake-affected population during the winter months.  Such activities have been and will continue to be important to address the immediate needs of earthquake- affected population.  To complement these activities, the USAID/DART is also promoting livelihoods and market revitalization that will assist people in obtaining their own food, shelter, and other needs.  3. To promote livelihoods and revitalize local markets, the USAID/DART has funded seven NGO partners to undertake activities including clearing roads; removing rubble and salvaging construction materials on-site at destroyed schools and hospitals; clearing shelter sites and community infrastructure by community-based groups; rebuilding community infrastructure; performing carpentry work to assist in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of family dwellings; constructing and rehabilitating latrines; and performing other labor-intensive camp-based activities.  --------------------- Implementation issues ---------------------  4. Implementation of additional livelihoods activities has had to wait, however, due to several factors.  During Ramadan, which began on October 4, the vast majority of Pakistanis fasted during the day and were, therefore, not enthusiastic about participating in CFW activities until Ramadan's end in early November.  In addition, the scarcity of local NGO implementing partners, poor road access in proposed activity areas, generous cash remittances from diaspora communities, and the difficulty in organizing activities due to the dispersal of settlements in the rural hillsides, also delayed livelihood programs startup.  --------------------------------------------- - President Musharraf's cash disbursement scheme --------------------------------------------- -  5. On November 11, President Musharraf announced that the GOP would immediately disburse 100,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR), which is approximately USD 1,666, to the next of kin of those who died in the earthquake, PKR 50,000 (USD 833) to people injured in the earthquake, and PKR 25,000 (USD 416) to those whose houses were damaged or destroyed.  This has created disincentives for affected populations to engage in CFW activities due to the promise of large inflows to communities.  6. As reported septel, this payment scheme has generated much publicity, although early reports received by USG officials at the Forward Operating Base in Mansehra suggest that implementation of the program has been inconsistent. Some district governments have already received funds to disburse to families that lost members.  In Mansehra, officials are allowing victims to file claims in any union council in the district, which are then verified against the record in the union council where the victim died. Battagram, however, is requiring victims to file in the union council where the death occurred, as officials are unable to cross check records from offices elsewhere in the district.  Payment is particularly complicated for those who have moved from Battagram's Allai Tehsil to Mehra Camp, which is located in neighboring Shangla district.  Shangla authorities claim that they will make immediate payments based on a death certificate issued within the district boundaries that identifies earthquake as the cause of death. Abbottabad is using the Mansehra model.  7. To date, no money has been provided to compensate for lost housing.  Payment is administered by the district governments, with each seeming to have its own disbursement mechanism.  As a result, progress is varying from district to district.  For example, the Mansehra district government claims to have made payments for deaths to the families of 70 percent of victims, although NGOs claim the actual rate is closer to 40 percent.  The Battagram district government claims to have made payments for deaths to the families of approximately 50 percent of victims.  The Shangla district government claims to have compensated 100 percent of those who lost family members, but this cannot be verified due to the scarcity of NGOs working with victims in this district. The Abottabad district government reports to have made payments for deaths to the families of 60 percent of victims, but NGOs believe the figure may be closer to 20 percent.  8. District authorities indicate that payments will continue until available federal funds are exhausted or until all victims are compensated, but no officials were able to estimate a timetable for the program's end.  The USAID/DART observes that the process of settling claims and disputes will likely take many months if not years to complete.  The USAID/DART will continue to monitor the implementation of this program to assess the impact on proposed USAID livelihoods and market revitalization activities.  ---------------------------- USAID/DART-FUNDED ACTIVITIES ------------------------------------------  9. In addition to facilitating the distribution of urgently needed relief commodities, the USAID/DART believes that livelihoods and economic revitalization will play a key role in the food security and recovery of the earthquake-affected area.  To date, the USAID/DART has provided approximately USD 4.5 million to seven NGO partners to implement Cash for Work (CFW), Cash for Training (CFT), and voucher activities. NGOs have undertaken assessments, identified priority areas and beneficiary populations, and mobilized teams to implement programs.  For quick start-up, some NGOs are working directly with community leaders rather than continue searching for local partners:  10. ACTED: Providing CFW for individuals to clear debris, salvage reusable materials, and engage in basic reconstruction of the infrastructure.  11. American Refugee Committee (ARC): Providing opportunities for 7,000 heads of households to rebuild homes with professional assistance, and is hiring skilled carpenters to supervise the building process.  12. Catholic Relief Services (CRS): Focusing programs on debris clearing, rehabilitation of public spaces and shelter rehab/reconstruction are currently underway.  13. GOAL: Providing non-agricultural workers with employment on civil and public works rehabilitation.  14. International Rescue Committee (IRC): Thus far, IRC is engaging in limited CFW activities to assemble emergency household shelter kits.  15. Mercy Corps: Employing local residents to clear rubble, prepare sites, and undertake shelter reconstruction and rehabilitation at a rate of 100 per day.  16. Save the Children/US (SC/US): CFW activities to improve Mehra camp have begun and SC/US plans to undertake CFT activities to promote seismic building guidelines.  17. In total, CFW and CFT programs funded by USAID will directly benefit approximately 45,000 people and indirectly benefit an additional 250,000 people.  The USAID/DART will continue engaging in discussions and sharing information regarding the implementation of livelihoods programs with its implementing partners.  This dialogue allows implementing partners to increase their implementation pace and efficacy.  ---------------------------- Transition to USAID/Pakistan ----------------------------  18. The USAID/DART has collaborated closely with USAID/Pakistan throughout the earthquake response and is developing a program to transition livelihoods activities to USAID/Pakistan.  The USAID/DART will fund proposals that both address immediate opportunities for livelihoods and market revitalization, while transitioning to longer-term reconstruction activities in support of the Mission reconstruction program.  Proposed activities under review and development include community-based earthquake-resistant shelter construction training, which will eventually bridge to mission-supported earthquake-resistant construction of schools and hospitals.  The USAID/DART is also exploring the possibility of revitalizing local markets through activities to support micro-finance and/or promotion of business development skills.    CROCKER

In October 2005, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) reported that preliminary assessments by the UN World Food Program (WFP) estimated more than 2.3 million Pakistanis in need of food assistance per reftel.  At that time, several NGOs suggested this figure was too high, but more recent assessments and field work by WFP, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock (MINFAL), support the original WFP estimate of at least 2.3 million people requiring food aid as a result of the October 8 earthquake.  2. Since November 9, the USAID/DART Food For Peace Officer (FFPO) has been assessing the food aid needs of earthquake- affected populations in consultations with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Attache, Government of Pakistan (GOP), WFP, UK Department for International Development (DFID), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Currently, the amount of wheat in country is adequate to meet food needs until April 2006.  WFP requires additional support, however, to cover the associated costs of food distributions through April.  The USAID/DART, in collaboration with the US Mission, continues to work closely with the GOP, donors, WFP and other UN agencies, ICRC, and NGOs to address food issues, and prevent any breaks in the pipeline in the coming months. End Summary. -------------------- FFPO Assessment Trip --------------------  3. Since November 9, the USAID/DART Food For Peace Officer (FFPO) has been in-country assessing the food aid needs of earthquake-affected populations in Pakistan.  To obtain information about the food, agriculture, and livestock situation on the ground, the FFPO reviewed the recently completed joint MINFAL/FAO report, quote Assessment of Damage to Crops and Livestock Sectors Due to Earthquake unquote.  In addition, the FFPO conducted field assessments and coordinated closely with the USDA Attache, the GOP Federal Relief Commission's (FRC) food cluster, WFP, DFID, and ICRC.  4. On November 15, the UN undertook an extensive assessment of the major earthquake relief hubs to determine the food security situation and assistance needs over the coming months.  The FFPO accompanied the WFP Special Envoy for the earthquake disaster, DFID disaster assessment expert, UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) Head, and WFP Head of Logistics for the earthquake disaster response.  The team visited WFP operational centers in Abbottobad, Mansehra, Batagram, Muzaffarabad, Garhi Habibullah, and Balakot.  WFP cooperation with the GOP Military and local authorities was good and the WFP implementing partners responsible for food distribution, although still setting up their operations, were beginning to receive and distribute food aid.  The FFPO noted that after initial start-up difficulties, the WFP logistics operation was becoming more efficient.  The USAID/DART will remain engaged to ensure that WFP operations continue to improve as assets grow and relations with other responders to the earthquake relief effort are consolidated and harmonized.  5. During the field visit, the FFPO observed that the GOP is providing compensation, as promised, to those who have lost their homes or family members during the earthquake.  As reported septel, death compensation is 100,000 Pakistan Rupees (approximately USD 1,666), while assistance for housing losses is 25,000 Rupees (USD 416).  In Balokot, residents have begun receiving 3,750 Rupees (USD 62) per month as a tent compensation for those who are in tented villages following the earthquake.  Officials expect that persons displaced will be able to use this subsidy to purchase food and necessities.  -------------------------------------------- The FAO/MINFAL Livestock and crop assessment --------------------------------------------  6. Completed in early November 2005, the FAO/MINFAL assessment results are consistent with the earlier WFP/UNICEF earthquake assessment, which found 3.5 million people affected by the earthquake.  Of this number, FAO/MINFAL indicated that 2.3 million people were homeless and in need of additional food and material assistance. This number has also been accepted by the GOP.  In the hardest hit areas, up to 50 percent of livestock was lost and 95 percent of all animal shelters destroyed.  Up to 75 percent of the maize crop, 50 percent of the wheat crop, and more than 30 percent of the rice crop was lost, as well as substantial animal fodder.  According to FAO/MINFAL, direct and indirect losses to crops, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure were more than USD 440 million.  Prior to the earthquake, six of the nine affected districts were already among the most food insecure parts of Pakistan.  As the winter progresses, livestock losses will likely increase due to exposure and a shortage of fodder. Earthquake victims are widely reported to be asking for assistance with shelter for their livestock.  7. The GOP, WFP, and ICRC are responsible for ensuring that the 2.3 million affected persons receive food.  WFP is responsible for the 1 million most inaccessible beneficiaries, ICRC has targeted another 150,000 in the Neelum Valley, and the GOP is tasked with assisting the remainder in accessible areas and major urban centers.  8. According to all indicators, Pakistan has enough wheat this year to meet needs countrywide.  Assuring that the wheat reaches the vulnerable and homeless, however, may present a challenge.  Of the 2.3 million earthquake victims identified as requiring food aid by the various assessments to date, WFP's caseload of 1 million for the next 6 months will require nearly 102,000 MT of food aid, including 76,000 MT of wheat.  Regardless of how the wheat is procured-even if donated-it will still require considerable financial inputs to mill, transport, store, handle, and distribute. Presently WFP has resources to process and deliver 16,000 MT.  WFP requires additional support to cover associated costs of food distributions.  Transport cost of delivering food aid to earthquake victims is significant, due to the need for helicopter support to reach up to 200,000 people in mountainous and inaccessible areas.  ----------------------- USDA Wheat contribution -----------------------  9. To date, USAID/OFDA has provided more than USD 8.9 million to WFP for humanitarian air operations, logistics, and administrative support.  USAID/FFP has provided WFP with 2,880 MT of PL Title II food assistance valued at more than USD 3.4 million.  On November 21, USDA offered Pakistan a USD 12 million wheat contribution, assuring adequate supplies to meet the needs of WFP's 1 million caseload until April 2006.  The USAID/DART will continue to assess conditions during the winter to determine food needs after April.  10. USDA's contribution of USD 12 million will cover costs for an estimated 46,000 MT of bulk wheat, plus the cost of shipping to Karachi.  The donation will not include port charges, handling and transport from Karachi, milling, fortification, storage, or final distribution to beneficiaries.  Instead, these costs will have to come from donor contributions to WFP's Emergency Operations (EMOP) appeal for the Pakistan earthquake.  11. According to WFP's latest resource update, the EMOP for 1 million beneficiaries over 6 months calls for 101,501 MT of food aid at a cost of nearly USD 26.5 million for food, and a total cost of more than USD 55.8 million, including food and all associated costs.  As of November 18, the EMOP has received approximately USD 21.1 million against its appeal, leaving a shortfall of more than USD 34.7 million. As of November 20, WFP is reaching 845,000 beneficiaries, including the ongoing operation for 200,000 Pakistanis in the most difficult to reach areas of the earthquake zone before the onset of the winter snow.  ---------- Conclusion ----------  12. Developing a clear picture of food aid needs for the population affected by the Pakistani earthquake and coordinating an appropriate response is an ongoing challenge.  Presently, sufficient wheat exists in country to allow WFP to draw down its needs.  The USDA offer of a USD 12 million contribution, replacing wheat used by WFP for immediate distribution, provides reassurance that WFP operations will continue beyond the winter.  USAID/FFP is also working on sending 2,600 MT of vegetable oil for WFP distribution.  With these two contributions in place, the WFP pipeline will be healthy.  WFP has funding to cover operations until the end of 2005, but does not yet have the necessary funds to cover associated costs, including road transportation and distribution, to continue its obligation through April 2006.

With the onset of winter, relief activities are moving into a critical stage where the needs of the earthquake- affected populations must be met efficiently and quickly. The difficulty of this task has been exacerbated by the changing climatic conditions, which are significantly altering the number and locations of people moving into tented camps.  Field reports indicate the need to improve the distribution network for relief commodities, the winterization of tents, and sanitation conditions in the growing camps.  The USG continues to play a vital role in meeting Pakistan's requirements for earthquake relief and recovery.  DOD services and excess commodities have been vital and will continue to be critically needed as winter sets in. End Summary.  -------------------------------------- Federal Relief Commission (FRC) Update --------------------------------------  2. In early November 2005, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) analyzed requirements, supply, and pipeline for relief commodities to determine critical shortfalls, per reftel.  This exercise drew available information from the latest FRC documents, USAID implementing partners, US Military, and the UN.  3. Unlike previous versions, the latest November 26 FRC report did not provide an update on needs, but focused on what relief communities had provided thus far.  Although the report contained flaws and was incomplete, the update gave humanitarian agencies an opportunity to refine information on their contributions.  The difficulty for the FRC in undertaking a gap analysis has been exacerbated by recent changing demographic and climatic conditions, which affect the number and location of people moving into spontaneous and planned tent camps and, consequently, relief requirements.  --------------------------- USAID Field Reports of Gaps ---------------------------  4. With the first snowfall in earthquake-affected areas on November 27, the requirement for detailed information on evolving needs is becoming more urgent.  Although the available information is incomplete, the DART has been able to draw the following conclusions:  5. Shelter: At this time, sufficient tents appear to have been distributed, but according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), only 15 percent are winterized.  Following the snowstorm on November 27, a report from the Sirin Valley indicated that many of the tents had fallen.  In addition, there continues to be a shortage of large-sized tents that could be used for dormitory style arrangements.  Size, quality, and winterization remain top priorities for this commodity.  6. Shelter Commodities Pipeline: Shelter commodities such as corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets are available in Pakistan although prices in-country have increased and quality is variable.  In addition, shelter commodities can be procured regionally.  One NGO has opened up a supply chain of CGI sheets from Dubai and report that it takes approximately one week from order date to clearance of customs in Karachi.  At an NGO coordination meeting convened on November 24 by the DART, eight organizations discussed the possibility of pooling together to submit group orders to assure a smooth flow of reasonably priced, high quality shelter materials from Dubai, India, or China.  7. Water and sanitation: Sanitation, particularly in camps, is an increasingly critical issue because of the onset of winter, the lack of appropriate shelter, and the resulting movement of people from the hills into spontaneous and planned tent camps.  Sanitation problems are not only a matter of constructing latrines, but are strongly related to camp management and education.  Effective camp management and education programs would allow organizations to site sanitation areas in the correct location, as well as teach camp residents the appropriate use of sanitation facilities.  8. Logistics: Several USAID-funded NGOs report increased landslides and slippery roads in the Neelum and Allai valleys because of the recent rain and snowfall.  Seven roads are currently impassable at various points, totaling 35 kilometers, and the conditions will worsen as winter sets in.  Regarding airlift, UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) states that present funding levels of USD 38 million have secured operation of current air assets through April (thirteen MI-8s and two MI-26 helicopters).  This falls short of their USD 99 million goal, which would provide 22 MI-8s and 5 MI-26 helicopters for 6 months.  9. Field reports indicate that food availability is sufficient at this time, but difficulties remain in the distribution network.  As winter worsens, and if there is an increase in the movement of dwellers into camps, it will be more difficult for the FRC to track the critical commodity needs of the affected popultion.  ---------------- DOD'scriica ole -------------------  10. Although civilian air support has increased in recent weeks, DOD air assets remain the backbone and most reliable component of the Pakistani military logistics chain.  With the onset of winter, already significant humanitarian needs in earthquake-affected areas of Pakistan will likely increase and logistics will be even further constrained. The adverse effects of snow and rain on relief supply distributions and the unpredictability of movements of populations will require strengthened transportation and logistics networks.  Given this outlook, it is clear that DOD plays a key role in the earthquake relief operation. DOD services and excess commodities have been vital and will continue to be critically needed as winter sets in.  --------------------- DART Response Actions ---------------------  11. USAID has provided more than USD 18 million in alternative shelter activities and winterization of tents to eight NGOs, assisting an estimated 420,000 beneficiaries. Further, the DART is planning to provide an additional USD 4.5 million for critical shelter activities.  To address water and sanitation problems, the DART has already provided USD 1.16 million to four NGOs for activities that will assist 97,000 beneficiaries.  In addition, the DART is committing approximately USD 3 million to address water and sanitation problems in spontaneous and planned tent communities in Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) and Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP).  The DART is continuing to program its resources to address changing needs as they arise.  CROCKER

Coordinating relief efforts and ensuring that USAID implementing partners reach populations in need without duplicating efforts are significant aspects of the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team's (DART) work.  Given the difficulties of this humanitarian operation, there is a need for collaboration and the sharing of both resources and information.  The USAID/DART is collaborating intensively with the U.S. military, other donors, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) military, and other GOP entities.  Members of the USAID/DART have greatly facilitated collaboration in areas of critical need.  Coordination, collaboration, and the sharing of information and material resources have helped maximize the impact of the USAID/DART's field work and programming.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- - Overview of USAID/DART Coordination Activities --------------------------------------------- -  2. Since October 10, the USAID/DART has been on the ground in Pakistan to coordinate the humanitarian response to the October 8 earthquake.  The USAID/DART is supporting programs in the areas of emergency and transitional shelter, water and sanitation, livelihoods, and emergency health.  The USAID/DART is also supporting airlifts of relief commodities, logistical activities, and coordinating U.S. military contributions to the relief effort.  Coordinating relief efforts and ensuring that USAID implementing partners reach populations in need without duplicating efforts are significant aspects of the USAID/DART's work.  3. A number of difficulties, including damaged and impassable roads, bottlenecks in the supply chain, and the rapidly narrowing window of opportunity due to the onset of winter, hamper the provision of humanitarian assistance. Given the difficulties of providing assistance in this setting, there is a need for relief agencies to share both resources and information.  -------------------------------- Collaboration with U.S. Military --------------------------------  4. The USAID/DART has collaborated intensively with the U.S. military, other donors, GOP military, and other GOP entities such as the Federal Relief Commission (FRC).  The USAID/DART includes a Military Liaison Officer (MLO) who, on a regular basis, meets with U.S. military officers to facilitate the distribution of commodities to both local and international NGOs, as well as other organizations.  5. The USAID/DART has collaborated with U.S. Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) officers in the planning of field activities.  The DAC shares its geospatial information on vulnerable populations, based on criteria that include road access, population density, earthquake-related damage, and altitude.  The USAID/DART is using this information to channel NGO implementation activities to these most vulnerable areas.  The DAC has also provided satellite photos that USAID/DART and its implementing partners use to target and plan interventions.  --------------------------------------------- --------- Collaboration with NGOs and other relief organizations --------------------------------------------- ---------  6.  The USAID/DART also collaborates with international NGOs, UN agencies, and aid organizations of foreign governments.  The USAID/DART has met with the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the Australian Government's Overseas Aid Program (AusAID), and the government of the Netherlands.  The USAID/DART has engaged in discussions and shared information with these organizations on their strategies, program priorities, performance of and support to the UN, and NGO funding.  In addition, DART is providing the part-time services of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coordinator to assist the UN's humanitarian information center (HIC) to establish base maps, obtain and interpret information on what donors and NGOs are implementing in the field, and present them in a format that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall relief effort.  ------------------------------- Collaboration with GOP military -------------------------------  7.  The USAID/DART attends coordination and strategy meetings-both sector level and gap analysis-with the FRC and GOP military on a daily basis.  The USAID/DART is a key player in the determination of the most effective means to support earthquake-affected populations.  In the field, USAID- and USAID/DART-funded NGOs collaborate extensively with local GOP military officials.  NGOs work under the protection of the GOP military and provide technical information to them in their execution of important relief activities, particularly camp administration and the distribution of food and relief commodities.  ------------------------------- Collaboration in Affected Areas -------------------------------  8.  The USAID/DART Field Officers (FOs) and Protection Officer (PO) have greatly facilitated collaboration in areas of critical need in Mansehra and Muzaffarabad.  In these areas, the FOs and PO have attended coordination meetings on a regular basis, where they meet with USAID implementing partners and other humanitarian relief agencies active in the earthquake response to help plan and better target their activities.  The USAID/DART FOs and PO work with implementing partners and others in the field to identify and meet needs in order of priority and solve problems that arise.  Technical specialists in shelter, wat/san and livelihoods also have collaborated extensively both in the field and in Islamabad to coordinate and improve the overall relief effort.  ---------- Conclusion ----------  9.  Taken together, all of the above coordination, information sharing, and resource sharing activities have helped to maximize the impact of the USAID/DART's fieldwork and programming.  The USAID/DART continues to seek further collaboration with donors, NGO partners, U.S. government organizations, and GOP organizations.  CROCKER

ISLAMABAD 013943      B. STATE 202805  Classified By: DOS Classification Guidelines  1.  (C) SUMMARY:  GOP officials took Ref B demarche points on the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline under consideration but had no immediate reply.  Petroleum Secretary Waqar met with Iranian officials in Tehran November 16-17 in what was termed a "confidence building" meeting that discussed routing options, gas quality, and price for the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.  The meeting follows the Government of Iran's passing a terms sheet on the proposed pipeline similar to one that it gave to the Government of India on September 10.  Waqar will visit India in mid-December, and a tripartite meeting in Tehran is expected to follow.  The GOP also will attend a January meeting in Ashgabat on the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, while the visits of two Chinese energy delegations to Pakistan reflect China's growing interest in the region.  END SUMMARY.  Pakistan Petroleum Secretary's Nov 16-17 Visit to Tehran ============================================= =========== 2. (C) On November 14, Deputy Econ Counselor met Pakistan Petroleum Additional Secretary Shawkat Durrani and delivered Washington's Ref B points, which Durrani took under consideration.  Durrani reported that after a two-month delay (Ref A), the Government of Iran in early November had passed the Government of Pakistan (GOP) a terms sheet that he believed was similar to one that Iran had given to the Government of India on September 10.  Durrani indicated that Iran has offered to sell gas from its South Pars fields, but his frustration with Iranian interlocutors was evident.  He described his Iranian counterparts as "very cunning and mercantile....They place no value on time and are willing to discuss all but the price."  3. (C) Duranni expressed concerns about Iran's insistence that all aspects of any pipeline arrangement be made "according to Iranian law."  Specifically, he said that the Iranians were insisting on a "buyback scheme," requiring that any gas purchased under a pipeline deal be sold to the National Iranian Gas Company and resold to the government/consortium purchasing the gas.  As he saw it, a private company developing the Pars Gas Field would sell the gas to the Iranian Government, which would then sell it to new GOP-owned Interstate Gas Company.  (Interstate is the new GOP-owned entity that the GOP has tasked with working on the Iran pipeline).  Interstate would then sell the gas to the Sui North and Sui South gas companies (both currently being privatized).  The Sui companies then would sell to the end-user customers.  Regulatory, commercial, legal, and financial issues under Iran's framework were also concerns. Durrani noted that India had hired a financial advisor for the project and the GOP hoped to select its own advisor by the mid-December.  4. (C) At a November 25 follow-up meeting with Durrani, he confirmed that he had shared the Washington talking points with Petroleum Secretary Waqar but that Waqar had made no comment on the points, describing the Iran pipeline discussions as "a long process."  Durrani related that at the Tehran meetings Waqar had discussed pipeline routing options, gas quality-- and price.  He informed that Waqar would travel to Canada soon, and in mid-December he would visit India to discuss the Iran pipeline.  Durrani said that following Waqar's meeting in India, a tripartite Iran-Pakistan-India meeting would be held, most likely in Tehran.  Progress on TAPI and LNG ======================== 5. (C) Regarding the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, Durrani indicated that Petroleum Secretary Waqar would attend a January meeting in Ashgabat, and Petroleum Minister Amanullah Khan Jadoon might also attend.  He confirmed that the Government of Turkmenistan had not confirmed quantity or availability of gas from its Dovelatabad reserves, and he speculated that GOT might finally disclose information on the reserves at the meeting.  For the GOP to proceed, however, Durrani indicated that the GOP would need reassurances about the security of a pipeline running through Afghanistan.  6. (C) On liquified natural gas (LNG), Durrani confirmed that a financial advisor resident in Karachi had been selected and the GOP was hoping to get an initial set of suggestions for setting up a GOP regulatory policy framework shortly (though he reiterated that LNG would not be sufficient to meet all of Pakistan's growing energy needs).  He stressed that the GOP was continuing its efforts to completely privatize the natural gas sector and due diligence continued apace in preparation for privatization of the Sui North and South Gas companies.  Growing Chinese Interest in Pakistan's Energy Sector ============================================= ======= 7. (C) Asked about press reports that the GOP was considering establishing a Pakistan-China Energy Forum, Durrani confirmed that a six-member delegation of the China Development and Reform Commission, led by Zhang Yuquing, had just visited Pakistan to explore investment opportunities in the oil and gas sector.  Durrani described the commission as one of China's highest decision-making bodies for energy policies, and said that the visit was an outgrowth of Prime Minister Aziz's 2004 visit to Beijing.  He said that the delegation had good discussions, including on the proposed  Iran pipeline, and the delegation then visited India.  Durrani said that the Chinese had expressed interest in becoming a partner in building pipelines, refineries, and fuel transport.  Durrani added that the Chinese National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation (CNEGC) was expected to visit Pakistan November 29 to discuss working in the energy sector, including developing the Thaar coal fields, constructing a refinery/oil storage facility along Pakistan's coast, and installing an LNG facility near Karachi (Pakistan is simultaneously pursuing multiple pipeline/LNG options.  While LNG will help, LNG cannot fully meet Pakistan's growing energy needs).  Minimal Earthquake Damage to Pakistan's Natural Gas Network ============================================= ============== 8. (C) Durrani reported that earthquake damage to Pakistan's 64,000 KM natural gas network was minimal because most pipelines are built in the southern part of the country, stopping short of Abbottabad, about an hour's drive south of where the most severe damage occurred.  Damage was mostly to Liquid Propane Gas (LPG) shops and petrol pumps.  As part of the national relief effort, public and private gas companies had donated approximately 430 million rupees (approximately $7.3 million). CROCKER

Since the beginning of the earthquake response, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) has included a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Officer.  The GIS Officer, currently from the U.S. Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit, regularly prepares maps and information products to demonstrate the extent and type of humanitarian requirements and show the locations of partner activities.  USAID-funded nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) recently submitted information on the coverage area of their activities, which was transferred to a GIS program and displayed in a comprehensive map.  The USAID/DART used the map to identify unmet humanitarian needs and avoid duplication of services.  The GIS Officer has provided an important service to the USAID/DART by providing the team with "eyes on the ground" knowledge.  End Summary.  ------------- Scope of Work -------------  2.  In the early stages of a disaster, maps are developed to show areas that are most severely affected, the number of people in need, and accessibility to the affected areas. Much of this information is reported and mapped as large polygons, each colored to reflect a single piece of data such as the percent of damage.  Once this information is mapped, demand is often created for more detailed information about specific areas.  --------------------- Maps as Program Tools ---------------------  3.  In recent years, GIS has become an important tool for the humanitarian and disaster response community and at present is widely used in the earthquake response in Pakistan.  The US military is using GIS for helicopter landing zones and delivery of materials; the UN Humanitarian Information Center and Joint Logistics Center both have GIS staff for production of specialized maps; and some NGOs are using GIS for information management.  Additional details regarding multi-agency information management in the Pakistan earthquake response will be reported septel.  4. The USAID/DART is creating maps to track the operational locations of implementing partners in order to determine if needs are being met and if areas exist where people are not being reached.  Maps are also used to identify gaps in coverage to enable implementing partners to expand their areas of operation to cover these needs.  On November 17, the USAID/DART invited partner nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to a coordination meeting in Islamabad that included a mapping exercise.  Each partner delineated their area of operation on a paper topographic map and the information was then transferred to a GIS system through on-screen digitization.  The partners' working areas were displayed as distinct polygons.  Once all of the partner program data was digitized onto one map, the USAID/DART had a collective visual representation of all NGO program areas.  5.  The USAID/DART Program Officer held follow-up meetings with individual NGOs and took along maps showing the combined program areas as well as a detailed map showing the operational area of each NGO.  The maps triggered discussions about on-the-ground coordination between NGOs working in the same location, areas where needs appeared to be unmet, delivery routes to the areas, and possible duplication of NGO services in a particular area.  Partners were also asked to add any program updates to the maps.  The changes were subsequently relayed to the GIS Officer to more accurately reflect the reality on the ground.  6.  The USAID/DART used the maps produced by the GIS Officer to assist with grant proposal reviews.  Program staff entered new or second tranche grant proposal information in the GIS to determine if the areas specified in the proposal were already covered, whether the proposal appeared to extend into an area with no previously identified damage, and to ascertain whether the proposed program location could be modified to cover an area of identified need. Information from this process was used to support funding decisions.  7.  At a second coordination meeting on November 24, NGOs were asked to provide additional information for mapping. NGOs responded to a questionnaire that asked if partner programs were meeting all or partial needs for shelter and emergency relief commodities.  They were also asked if they knew of areas where these needs were not being met.  In some cases, individual NGOs were working in up to seven separate sites and implementing different programs at each site. Data from the questionnaire was then linked to the respective NGO polygons in the GIS by the GIS Officer.  Maps were produced showing commitments for winter shelter kit distribution and emergency relief commodity distribution.  ------------------ A Replicable Model ------------------  8.  To promote donor collaboration, the USAID/DART shared map products with colleagues at the UK's Department for International Development (DFID).  Recognizing the value of the GIS program, DFID has begun to implement a similar program to map the program location of DFID-funded NGOs.  At DFID's request, the GIS Officer is providing assistance in duplicating the same model with DFID-funded NGOs.  ----------------------------- Value Added for USAID Mission -----------------------------  9.  USAID/Pakistan requested the assistance of the GIS Officer in identifying and testing GIS software for possible use in the Mission.  To more effectively display the geographical coverage of programs, USAID/Pakistan aims to import spreadsheets with location coordinates into a comprehensive map.  The GIS Officer recently gave a one-hour GIS presentation and demonstrated ways that GIS tools can be useful for program management.  The Mission plans to use maps created by the GIS Officer designed to track the locations of USAID-funded earthquake activities as a starting point for reconstruction planning, thereby allowing USAID to build on existing relationships with local government officials, NGOs, and other stakeholders.

On December 3, 2005, the UN Resident Representative and Humanitarian Coordinator (UNHC) in Pakistan stated that the relief effort is on a knife,s edge and called for increased donor support for the USD 550 million UN Flash Appeal.  Local and international media picked up on the UNHC,s remarks and have recently painted an increasingly dire picture of the humanitarian situation in the earthquake-zone and the under-funded response effort to date.  Often based on incomplete and inaccurate information, many reports fail to recognize significant efforts by the entire humanitarian community, especially donors, NGO partners, and the Pakistani military, in providing timely and effective humanitarian interventions.  Although much work remains, the response to date has undoubtedly saved lives.  With the situation continuing to evolve and the emergency phase expected to continue through the spring, the USG is committed to responding rapidly as winter conditions arrive.  End Summary.  ---------- Background ----------  2. On December 3, the UNHC, Jan Vandemoortele, convened a press conference to draw attention to humanitarian conditions and appeal for additional UN funding.  Although the precise text of Mr. Vandemoortele remarks is not available, quotations from the conference were widely carried by the local and international media.  The comments require further clarification as they have often been based on incomplete and inaccurate information, thereby presenting a skewed picture of the situation on the ground.  ---------------- Response efforts ---------------- 3. UNHC comment: The worst enemies we face are not the mountains, not the winter; the worst enemies we face are complacency and pessimism.  a. USG Response: The USG welcomes the UN recognition of the importance of action, particularly in the face of a delayed initial response by UN agencies per reftel.  This assertion, however, fails to recognize the large-scale efforts by the entire humanitarian community to the October 8 earthquake, and the significant impact of the response.  b. Donors: In addition to the response to the UN appeal, bilateral assistance from the USG, the UK,s Department for International Development (DFID), and the European Union is well over USD 200 million.  c. Department of Defense (DOD): Although civilian air support has increased in recent weeks, DOD air assets remain the backbone and most reliable component of the Pakistani military logistics chain.  As of November 30, DOD had completed 2,004 sorties, carrying more than 4,817 tons, 11,544 passengers, and 3,656 medical evacuations; off loading 254 aircraft and approximately 7,289 tons of humanitarian cargo.  DOD commodities provided include 3,116 tents, 200,058 blankets, and 600 tent heaters.  d. Government of Pakistan (GOP): The GOP military has assumed a great deal of responsibility in the relief effort and performed well under difficult circumstances.  Not only has the GOP military proven effective in terms of reach and responsiveness, but it has also been keen to learn from the donor community best practices in addressing technical issues such as camp management, relief commodity distriution, and water and sanitation interventions.  Moreover, the GOP is reportedly building 5,000 shelters a day, and assuming the costs for the shelter provided.  e. NGOs: USAID implementing partners were on the ground within days of the earthquake, and remain at the forefront of emergency response efforts.  ----------------------- Increased Funding Needs -----------------------  4. UNHC comment: The situation remains very difficult and indeed we are on a knife,s edge.  a. USG Response: To date, the UN has received USD 158.2 million to the Flash Appeal, and USD 64.5 million more pledged.  With the addition of an estimated USD 100 million bilaterally from donors, more than half of the amount requested has been received thus far.  In the face of a compressed timeline for response, the UN appeal for more funding needs to be packaged with clear indication of how monies will be expended.  The Flash Appeal has requested USD 550 million, but includes funding for secondary and tertiary programs, rather than just immediate, life-saving needs.  On December 2, the UN released a Winter Plan for the critical period of December 2005 through February 2006.  However, the Winter Plan does not indicate how much funding is needed for the critical emergency sectors.  As not all sectors are on a knife,s edge, UN agencies need to triage and better prioritize needs.  -------------- Food Situation --------------  5. UNHC comment: Emergency food stocks were built up, but rations had been cut so they could last longer.  a. USG Response: Actually, rations were not cut to extend resources, but rather because in some areas, food was already available as was the case in ICRC,s distribution area, where full rations were not needed.  The UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) is covered at the current level (nearly meeting its target of 100 MT a day), through February, based Q.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: EAID, AEMR, ASEC, MASS, ECON, KMDR, KPAO, OIIP, OPRC, PGOV, PREL, PK SUBJECT: PAKISTAN - EARTHQUAKE:  UN CREATES ANOTHER MEDIA STORM  on a caseload of 1 million people.  With a recent USDA donation of 46,000 MT of wheat, the food pipeline is healthy.  b. With the food aid pipeline stabilized, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) recommends a shift away from a primary focus on food assistance to addressing unmet shelter needs.  ------- Shelter -------  6. UNHC comment: Vandemoortele stressed that most people were using blankets, tarpaulins and whatever else they could lay their hands on to bring their tents up to standard to get through the winter.  a. USG: This takes a negative slant on people using available materials to rebuild, despite the fact that the use of recycled materials is an important component of the widely supported shelter strategy, as it speeds up reconstruction and allows people to remain in place.  This protects assets and livelihoods, rather than forcing them to go to makeshift camps and facing the associated health hazards of displacement.  To support this strategy, the USAID/DART is providing NGO partners with shelter kits to assist rebuilding efforts in affected areas.  7. According to media reports, a UN official in charge of providing shelter also warned that 90 per cent of the 420,000 tents handed out were not ready for winter.  a. USG: Inaccurately attributed to the UN, this is a statement by an International Organization for Migration (IOM) official.  The UNHC acknowledges that although 90 per cent of tents are not winterized, it does not mean that they are inadequate; the proportion of inadequate tents is much smaller.  Moreover, non-winterized tents can be used at lower elevations or reinforced with additional materials such as blankets, plastic sheeting, or bubble wrap for insulation. ---------------- Health/Nutrition ----------------  8. Recent media reports have highlighted the possibility of deteriorating health status as harsh winter conditions are realized.  Although cases of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections (ARI), and pneumonia have been reported, to date, no major communicable disease outbreaks have been reported. Accurate health baseline data for northern Pakistan is limited.  The earthquake-affected residents, in particular those living in remote areas at high altitudes, are vulnerable each year, with high levels of chronic malnutrition.  According to USAID/DART field staff, a significant number of people die each year from ARI and pneumonia.  The UN has acknowledged that conclusions regarding increased cold weather-related mortality rates are premature.  ----------------------------- Improved Health and Education -----------------------------  9. With limited medical facilities in northern Pakistan prior to the earthquake, many residents are likely accessing health services for the first time, due to the influx of clinics in the affected areas as part of the humanitarian response. This may lead to the appearance of a higher incidence of disease compared to normal levels, but may be attributed to improved disease surveillance and more consistent reporting.   10. One positive aspect of the humanitarian response that has been largely overlooked by the media is the higher number of children enrolled in school in the IDP camps*some for the first time.  In past years, schools are usually closed for a few months during the winter; however, this year the schools will likely remain open, due in part to the presence of the international aid community.  While some media reports have criticized the quality of tents used for temporary schools, the tents are meant to be used as daytime structures.  The children attending school also receive the benefits of hygiene education, which includes lessons on the use of latrines, a skill that will improve the children,s health when they return home.  ---------------------------- Conclusions: The Big Picture ----------------------------  11. Although recent media reports have seized on the shortfalls of the earthquake relief operation and the UNHC has publicly remarked that the relief effort is on a knife,s edge, it is important to note that incomplete reports are misleading, fail to recognize significant efforts by the entire humanitarian community, and do not provide an accurate picture of the evolving situation.  12. While it is important to anticipate and prepare for a deteriorating situation, some media reports are basing a worst-case scenario on faulty assumptions.  One often repeated scenario is that massive population movements from remote higher elevation areas to the valley will overwhelm the limited space available in existing camps, resulting in large-scale deaths from freezing temperatures.  USAID/DART field reports, as well as reports from NGOs, indicate that much of the earthquake-affected population will remain in place rather than moving to camps.  In addition, the GOP has prepared for this contingency by developing plans to move displaced populations if necessary to Punjab Province, an area with a milder climate where concerns about winter conditions, lack of access, and crowded conditions are insignificant.  13. The earthquake-affected population faces an uncertain future and significant challenges remain.  The USG remains committed to responding rapidly as winter conditions set in. USG resources have been vital in meeting Pakistan,s requirements for earthquake relief and recovery and will continue to be critically needed during the coming months. Misleading media reports, generated in this and other cases by comments from UN officials, only cloud the overall picture and make accurate assessments and responses that much more difficult.

The rapid onset of the Himalayan winter has brought greater urgency to efforts to winterize shelters of earthquake-affected populations.  Agencies are stepping up efforts to ensure that families receive adequate winterization materials and tools, including blankets and plastic sheeting to reinforce non-winterized tents.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) is strongly advocating for shelter needs to receive higher priority through the Shelter Cluster mechanism-an interagency working group chaired by IOM comprised of GOP officials, UN representatives, NGOs, and donors.  The USAID/DART is also working closely with the US Embassy and Departments of State and Defense to reinforce this message with GOP officials. Further, USAID is airlifting an additional 6,000 sheets of tarpaulin and 2,500 blankets that can be used to insulate the walls and floors of tents or shelters.  In coordination with the Shelter Cluster, the USAID/DART is also exploring other winterization options in order to rapidly address immediate shelter needs.  End Summary.  -------------------------------------------- Coordinating the Race for Thermal Protection --------------------------------------------  2. The USAID/DART Shelter and Settlements Advisor (SSA) reports that there has not been a significant increase in the population requiring shelter assistance as estimated soon after the earthquake of October 8, 2005.  What has changed, however, is the worsening of conditions due to the onset of the Himalayan winter.  As a result, winterization of current shelters has become increasingly urgent.  3. At present, the number of people requiring shelter assistance remains imprecise, with agencies using a range of planning figures.  Per reftel, the USAID/DART estimates that 400,000 households or 2.8 million people have shelter needs as a result of the earthquake.  The International Organization for Migration's (IOM) planning figure for a worst-case scenario is 3.2 million homeless.  4. The number of remaining shelter needs is also ambiguous. According to the GOP's Federal Relief Commission (FRC), shelter needs have largely been met, particularly for residents at the 5,000 feet elevation, above which people are particularly at risk due to extreme cold and lack of access during the winter months.  IOM staff in Islamabad also reported that 100 percent of people still living above 5,000 feet will have received shelter assistance by December 10.  5. (Comment: These assertions of 100 percent shelter coverage are widely disputed by USAID/DART field staff, NGOs, and IOM staff in the field, all of whom argue that the level of shelter assistance achieved thus far falls far short of 100 percent.  At a December 8 Cluster Meeting, NGOs even disagreed with an estimate that 80 percent of shelter needs had been met, indicating that the coverage was even lower in areas where they were working.  In its latest draft of the winterization strategy, IOM reduced the 100 percent estimate to 90 percent and, in light of the discussion at the December 8 meeting, may reduce it even further.  In addition, IOM clarified that the 100 percent figure refers to the actual distribution of shelter materials.  However, residents may not have used the materials for shelter construction.  6. Comment continued: Local commanders responsible for populations in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) are taking two approaches to meeting shelter needs.  In AJK, there is a strategy to shelter people in place, outside of camps, whereas in NWFP, the GOP has encouraged camp settlements.  The disconnect in how to best address shelter needs stems in part from the fact that initially the GOP position on shelter was to encourage all affected populations to migrate to camps and in part from the fact that AJK has relatively few sites suitable for camps and NWFP has many. End comment.)  ------------------- Shifting Priorities -------------------  7. In light of rapidly approaching winter conditions when access to populations requiring shelter assistance will be restricted, the percentage of shelter materials presently carried by helicopters should receive higher priority.  One reason for urgency is that shelters cannot be built once snow is on the ground.  8. Due to concerted efforts by donors, the UN World Food Program (WFP), and the GOP, the food supply in high altitude areas is generally considered within the humanitarian community to be adequate, with a healthy pipeline of food though the winter.  In addition, there is locally-produced food available from this year's harvest.  9. As a result, USAID/DART field staff and NGO partners report that at present, shelter is the primary concern of affected populations remaining in or near their homes.  The GOP and WFP recently redistributed geographic responsibilities to manage the effective distribution of food commodities, with WFP covering the most difficult areas to access.  As of December 1, WFP began to move its operations from main population centers to Allai, Kaghan, Neelum, Lipa and other high elevation valleys.  These areas are unlikely to be served by the market because of snowfall, landslides, or the fact that normal harvest and trading patterns were interrupted by the effects of the earthquake.  Further, the USAID/DART Food for Peace Officer is currently in Mansehra to assess food needs and explore options for food relief at a later date should the situation change and pockets of needs emerge.  -------------------------------------------- Delays in Transportation of Shelter Supplies --------------------------------------------  10. One reason for delays in the delivery of shelter materials is the inexperience of some NGOs with logistical operations.  For example, the UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) has cited cases of improperly packaged shelter materials and instances when NGOs have not followed established channels to request air support from UNJLC.  As a result, at times helicopters have been ready to pick up NGO shelter commodities but could not transport them as scheduled.  11. Further complicating the timely provision of shelter assistance are some GOP restrictions on the importation of commodities, which have caused long sourcing and procurement delays.  For example, corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets, manufactured in India but purchased in Dubai, have been stalled in customs for nearly three weeks.  To date, waivers appear to have been granted on case-by-case basis, and the humanitarian community has requested a blanket waiver from the FRC to facilitate relief efforts.  There is some speculation that delays are due to market protection issues; however, this has not been confirmed.  In an effort to take immediate corrective action, the USAID/DART is pursuing the possibility of establishing a joint commodity warehouse, likely in tandem with the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), where commodities would be collectively warehoused and made available to the humanitarian community as needed.  --------------------------------------------- - USG Efforts Regarding Urgency of Shelter Needs --------------------------------------------- -  12. At this time, the USAID/DART's strategy reflects an emphasis on expedited shelter relief to the high altitude affected region.  It is anticipated this will be the case for the next several weeks, with the main objective being to meet critical shelter requirements while there is access to these elevations and needs persist.  The bulk of relief commodities transported during this time will consist of CGI sheets, plastic sheeting and blankets.  Based on recommendations from USAID/DART's SSA, further commodities for shelter kits, such as nails, screws, rope and sand bags, are being considered.  A "Special Standards Task Force" was also established as of December 4 at the Forward Operating Base in Muzaffarabad to ensure quality control and consistency in shelter supplies.  In addition to the attention to high elevation areas, the USAID/DART will be closely tracking shelter requirements below 5,000 feet, especially in organized and spontaneous camps and congested urban settings.  In this regard the USAID/DART strategy entails diligent oversight of humanitarian relief in the areas of health, and water and sanitation needs.  13. With the situation becoming more critical, the USAID/DART has undertaken the following actions in recent days to raise awareness regarding the urgency of shelter needs:  14. Encouraged agencies to take immediate action to transport a greater percentage of shelter materials to affected areas, and to increase emphasis on meeting shelter needs.  The priority should be providing more emphasis on shelter needs, rather than discussion leading to consensus on what percentage of shelter needs remained to be met.  15. Advocated with the FRC to prioritize the immediate shelter needs of affected populations, especially located in hard to reach areas above 5,000 feet.  With the deadline for intervention December 15 to 20, the USAID/DART advocated a shift to shelter rather than continued emphasis on food. With food largely available in Mansehra and Muzaffarbad, according to USAID/DART field assessments, and the fact that food aid can be transported after winter sets in; the provision of shelter assistance to those without should be prioritized.  16. Refocused dialogue at Shelter Cluster meetings at the Islamabad and field levels in Mansehra and Muzaffarabad to ensure that shelter needs receive appropriate attention. USAID/DART staff reported a continued disconnect between the field staff and the agencies in Islamabad.  17. Engaged multi-agency efforts, including DOD, UNJLC, and WFP to ensure that movements of shelter commodities are most effectively transported.  On December 9, DOD Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) staff attended an NGO meeting to provide training and guidance on the proper procedures for requesting air support and the appropriate packaging and off- loading of relief materials.  18. The USAID/DART is in discussions with DFID, regarding joint support of a commodities warehouse with resource materials purchased locally or within the region for NGOs to access easily, compared to the current bureaucratic system that is subject to significant delays.  -------------------------- Assistance Efforts to Date --------------------------  19. USAID: In support of the overall shelter strategy, USAID has provided 66,500 sheets of tarpaulin, 45,000 blankets, 1,570 winterized tents, and 455 tents since the beginning of the emergency.  In addition, USAID funded eight NGO partners to provide shelter assistance to approximately 75,500 households.  As agencies step up winterization efforts, USAID is airlifting an additional 6,000 sheets of tarpaulin and 2,500 blankets that can be used to insulate the walls and floors of tents or shelters.      In addition, the USAID/DART is conducting field assessments to gauge the capacity of implementing partners to scale up current operations in light of winterization needs.  20. DOD: Through the Joint Operations Center (JOC), the US military is working with the UNJLC and the GOP Military to develop a "smart pull" or requirements based strategy to appropriately distribute relief supplies.  Instead of instituting a set percentage of the type of commodities that are delivered across the board, the shipments are determined by the end point receivers to "pull" the most-needed commodities to the field.  In addition, as of December 7, DOD had provided 4,602 tents, 250 rolls of plastic sheeting, 232,092 blankets, and 600 heaters.  Additionally, DOD provided air support to transport shelter commodities.  21. Multi-agency efforts: The Shelter Cluster is coordinating the multi-agency winterization and shelter efforts.  On December 5, the Shelter Cluster reported that approximately 35,000 self-help shelter kits have been distributed and the GOP military has built an estimated 40,000 transitional shelters.  In addition, the international humanitarian community and the GOP military have distributed more than 612,562 tents and more than 4.1 million blankets.  By December 10, the Shelter Cluster estimates that agencies will have distributed 174,000 sheets of CGI.  CROCKER

On December 11, 2005, the US Military provided helicopter transport to Pashtu and Gangwal villages in the remote earthquake-affected Allai Valley for three USAID/DART members, the Commander of the 3rd Marine Hospital Shinkiari and Mansehra, and the US Embassy's Mansehra Forward Operating Base Officer in Charge (OIC).  The team was accompanied by a representative from USAID partner NGO, Save the Children US (SC-US), which is working in eight Union Councils in the Allai Valley.  Due to access constraints to this area, air support is imperative for transport of emergency relief.  SC-US is distributing urgently needed household and shelter kits and food to these areas, and plans to cover the eight union councils by December 23. Distribution is ongoing, and is addressing the particular issue of women's access to relief in these communities.  The USAID/DART will continue to conduct field visits to monitor humanitarian conditions in affected areas. End summary.  ------------------------------------ Limited Access to Pashtu and Gangwal ------------------------------------  2. On December 11, the US Military facilitated site visits by helicopter to two villages in the remote earthquake- affected Allai Valley for three USAID/DART members, the Commander of the 3rd Marine Hospital Shinkiari and Mansehra, and the US Embassy's Mansehra Forward Operating Base OIC. The team was accompanied by a representative from USAID partner SC-US, which is working in eight Union Councils in the Allai Valley, including Pashtu, a village located at 5,161 feet, with a population of approximately 17,000 people, and Gangwal, which had 12,000 residents, and is located at 5,413 feet.  3. Descent into the valley was striking in that homes throughout the region were nestled into steep hillsides-many close to the tree-line on snow-clad mountains.  Gusts of wind made landing difficult in Pashtu, and provided a strong indication that winter conditions are at the doorstep of the valley's residents.  The USAID/DART noted that helicopter assistance is imperative for transporting relief items to this area.  According to SC-US staff, the one road providing access to Pashtu has been blocked since the October 8 earthquake, and the primary means of movement between the larger town of Banna, located in the main Allai Valley, and Pashtu village is a steep trail that drops deeper into the valley.  ------------------------- Distributions In Progress -------------------------  4. During the USAID/DART's visit to Pashtu, a distribution of non-food items (NFIs) was underway for a targeted 2,000 households to receive winter shelter and/or household kits, containing plastic sheeting, saws, hammers, picks, wire, nails, axes, stoves, shawls, and blankets.  (Note: SC-US is targeting distributions of food and shelter and household kits to an estimated 12,288 households in Pashtu, Bateela, Rashang, Banna, Biari, Sakargah, Jambera, and Batkool union councils in the Allai Valley. End note).  SC-US is providing the kits to 2-3 villages a day, with plans to cover all 25 villages by December 23 if weather conditions permit.  5. SC-US has also completed a survey in Gangwal village, Rashang Union Council, and already delivered shelter and household kits to half of the 1,700 families identified for assistance.  Similar to the distribution strategy employed throughout SC-US operational areas, households at higher elevations-as high as 7,000 feet in Rashang-are receiving priority for distribution of the kits.  6. The UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) has been providing the necessary helicopter support to airlift these relief commodities.  SC-US staff reported that in the past week, UNHAS delivered a combination of food and emergency supplies, with airlifts of NFIs exclusively in the last four days in response to the urgent need for transport of shelter and winterization materials.  The USAID/DART observed that the GOP military, CARE, and Swiss Humanitarian Aid have also provided relief to this village, and another NGO has just arrived to help the Pashtu people construct dome tents.  ------------------------------------- Women's Access to Relief and Services -------------------------------------  7. During the course of the visit, USAID/DART members observed only a few women in the distance, in the midst of hundreds of men and boys who were lined up to receive household and shelter kits.  The ability of women to access relief remains one of the foremost concerns of the USAID/DART.  In an effort to ensure that women are not excluded, SC-US worked with community members and local NGOs to identify beneficiaries through a community survey.  Among the most vulnerable population, widows and female-headed households received priority.  In Pashtu, SC-US identified 214 widows with the assistance of the local population.  As these women were registered, they were given three "chits", or colored pieces of paper, which entitled them to a special relief package containing shelter and household kits and food.  At the same time, the women were asked to select a trusted family/community representative who would be authorized to submit these chits for commodities to transport to the women's shelters.  SC-US is following-up with monitoring activities and home visits to ensure that the materials reach each widow.  8. On December 6, SC-US established a temporary hospital in nearby Banna, staffed with male and female physicians, several of whom are Pashtu and Urdu speaking.  Of particular note is that more than 60 women are lining up daily to access health care as a result of the presence of female doctors at the hospital.  SC-US staff noted that some women in the community are receiving health services for the first time, as this access to services did not exist in the past. To improve access even more, SC-US plans to add a separate hospital entrance for women in the coming days.  9. SC-US efforts to ensure access for women to shelter materials and health services demonstrate how USAID/OFDA partners are providing equitable life-saving relief while respecting cultural sensitivities.  In early January, a gender specialist will join the USAID/DART as a Protection Officer to address this and other gender concerns.  -------------------------------- Shelter Remains Priority Concern --------------------------------  10. The USAID/DART paid special attention to the issue of food availability during the site visits to Pashtu and Gangwal and the flyover of the Allai Valley.  Through SC-US, WFP has provided a 45-day ration for blanket distribution in Pashtu.  Throughout the valley, the team observed mounds of recently reaped maize and wheat on the terraced rice paddies next to damaged homes.  Some of the mounds were covered with plastic tarpaulin to protect the harvests from the elements. While it is unclear what percentage of the normal crop yields were lost as a result of the earthquake, the USAID/DART continues to find in interviews with villagers that food needs appear to be adequately addressed.  At this juncture, shelter is the primary concern. 11. According to several residents who were waiting to receive their shelter kits, people generally want to stay in their communities, even in high elevation areas.  This sentiment was corroborated by SC-US's field staff in Pashtu, many of whom are from the affected village.  12. Supplies for construction of sturdier shelters are in great demand.  The USAID/DART continues to raise related questions about the viability of tents to withstand the harsh winters and whether or not villagers are "saving" tents.  It may be that some people are safeguarding the tents that are too flimsy to live in, but could serve as shelter for livestock and/or grain storage.  The USAID/DART will continue to follow this issue in order to assure the best use of commodities distributed at these high elevations.  -------------------- Water and Sanitation --------------------  13. Traditionally, villagers in these remote communities walk several miles to obtain potable water.  Although there were some functioning pipes in Pashtu that provided a trickling of water, SC-US noted that pipes had been damaged and water availability is limited.  In discussions with SC- US staff, the team learned that it is not uncommon for men to bathe infrequently during the winter months.  Some men bathe when visiting the larger town of Banna, where they can purchase a bucket of hot water at a barber shop with special rooms for washing.  However, this is reportedly not an option for women.  These cultural hygiene habits are likely to have health implications for communities in "spontaneous" camps if more people move to these areas.  ----------- Conclusions -----------  14. With the rapid onset of winter conditions, the USAID/DART continues to address the shelter needs of vulnerable populations.  Based on the monitoring visit to Pashtu and Gangwal, distribution of key survival shelter and household kits appears to be proceeding on schedule.  In particular, SC-US is recognizing the needs of women in obtaining relief commodities, specifically shelter materials and health services.  On December 11, USAID airlifted an additional 6,000 sheets of tarpaulin and 2,500 blankets that can be used to insulate the walls and floor of tents or shelters per reftel.  The USAID/DART will continue to conduct field visits to monitor humanitarian conditions.  15. The USAID/DART extends a special thanks to the US Military in Pakistan for its services in enabling the team and its partners access to conduct rapid assessments and monitor program progress.

On December 1, 2005 the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and the Government of Pakistan (GOP) implemented a new division of geographic responsibilities to distribute food to approximately 2.3 million people in the earthquake-affected areas of Northern Pakistan.  The GOP requested that WFP move its urban-based operations from main population centers to Allai, Kaghan, Neelum, Lipa and other high altitude valleys to take advantage of WFP's logistical capacity delivering food in difficult to access areas.  The GOP is covering urban areas and rural areas easily accessible by road and has taken over WFP operations in Mansehra.  However, in the geographic areas covered by the GOP,  WFP is maintaining food distributions within UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) tented camps, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) tented schools, hospitals, and supplementary feeding programs for children under five and pregnant and lactating women.  USAID nongovernmental partners (NGOs) have expressed frustration that the local government has not effectively communicated the terms of the new agreement to beneficiaries, creating unmet expectations.  Despite these concerns with the details of food distribution responsibilities, there is currently an adequate supply of food in Pakistan for earthquake victims. End Summary.  ---------------------- Splitting the Caseload ---------------------- 2. At the outset of the emergency, the international humanitarian community took a collegial approach to determining areas of operation for food distribution.  For the most part, NGOs on the ground identified their areas of operation and coordinated with WFP to target beneficiaries and establish emergency food distributions.  In addition to WFP and NGO efforts, the GOP was also providing food, leading to some duplication of efforts.  3. On December 1, a new agreement went into effect that clarified areas of responsibilities and caseloads, making the entire movement and provision of food more efficient and maximizing individual organizational strengths.  WFP is using a combination of land transport and helicopters to provide food to UNHCR tented camps and the difficult to access rural areas.  The GOP and the provincial governments are covering urban and less affected areas, as well as insuring that markets and commercial food distribution networks are uninterrupted.  WFP and the GOP are each responsible for providing food to 1.1 million people. Additionally, the International Committee for the Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC) is continuing its feeding and support program in the lower Neelum Valley for 150,000 beneficiaries.  ----------------------------------------- Food Operations under the New Arrangement -----------------------------------------  -GOP Operations-  4. The GOP is responsible for ensuring food security to approximately 1.1 million people living below 5,000 feet elevation by reactivating markets in the earthquake zone and launching cash compensation programs for earthquake victims who lost family members and/or had homes damaged or destroyed.  When necessary, the GOP will provide direct food distributions; however, to the extent possible, the GOP will rely solely on market mechanisms to provide food and other commodities at reduced prices as well as government subsidized stores called "Utility Stores."  The GOP is DCHA/FFP FOR JONATHAN DORKEN allocating more than 300,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat flour to Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) governments to be channeled through the utility stores and other market outlets.  On December 9, the FRC reported that there are 30 operational utility stores in the earthquake-affected areas and a further 12 will be established.  -WFP Operations-  5. WFP is assisting its caseload of 1.1 million people through direct food distributions and supplementary feeding though March 2006.  As of November 30, WFP had distributed 23,101 MT of emergency food commodities, of which 1,924 MT were distributed via air transport.  This figure represents approximately 25 percent of the overall 101,000 MT required to feed the WFP caseload.  6. Through cooperating partners, WFP is providing blanket one-month food rations of 96 kilograms per six-person family to 751,221 people living above 5,000 feet elevation and other difficult to access areas in AJK and NWFP.  Of this total, there are an estimated 441,221 beneficiaries in AJK and 310,000 in NWFP.  WFP has sub-offices in Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Ghari Habibullah, and Batagram.  7. In addition to the general food distribution, WFP is providing or will provide food in UNHCR tented camps for up to 250,000 persons who have lost their homes, means of livelihoods, and income and are now living in tents in rural, urban, and semi-urban areas.  In facilities supported by UNICEF and the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO), WFP is providing hospital feeding for up to 5,000 patients.  8. To support the nutritional needs of children, WFP is providing fortified blended cereal along with the general food distribution for children aged 6 months to 5 years.  In affected villages and tented camps, these children are receiving wheat soya blend (WSB) as a supplementary ration, and WFP has the capacity to reach up to 150,000 beneficiaries.  WFP is also conducting emergency school feeding for 150,000 primary school children in UNICEF- supported tent schools.  In tented and open air schools, UNICEF/WFP-supported schools that were destroyed, and selected government schools that were destroyed, children are receiving high energy biscuits and dates.  ----------------------------------- WFP's Winter Logistics and Pipeline -----------------------------------  9. WFP will continue to provide rations through March 2006 by helicopter in snow-covered inaccessible areas and by truck to accessible UNHCR camps, school feeding sites, and supplementary feeding programs.  WFP has deployed 46 mobile warehouse tents with a total capacity of approximately 23,000 MT, utilized for food storage as well as for non-food item pre-positioning.   All NGOs and agencies assisting in the earthquake relief effort have free access to mobile warehouse storage.  An additional 22 mobile warehouse tents are in the pipeline and will be used to strengthen the logistics capacity of WFP and its cooperating partners. This is particularly valuable as it supports the ongoing effort to establish storage points as close as possible to beneficiary populations.  10. According to the USAID/DART Food for Peace Officer (FFPO), the WFP food commodity pipeline is quite healthy. WFP is currently distributing 2,400 Metric Tons (MT) of vegetable oil provided by USAID/FFP.  An additional USAID/FFP donation of 2,490 MT of vegetable oil is currently being finalized.  Presently, sufficient wheat exists in country to allow WFP to draw down its needs.  Per reftel, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offer of a USD 12 million contribution to replace wheat used by WFP provides reassurance that WFP operations will continue beyond the winter. (Note:  Although the WFP food commodity pipeline is healthy, WFP does not yet have the necessary funds to cover associated costs, such as road transportation and distribution, to continue its obligation through April 2006. The USAID/DART, in collaboration with the US Mission in Pakistan, continues to work with the GOP, donors, UN agencies, ICRC, and NGOs to address this important need. End note.)  ------------------------------------------- Confusion over Division of Responsibilities -------------------------------------------  11. The new division of food assistance responsibilities makes good use of the respective operational capabilities of WFP and the GOP since WFP is delivering food to the most difficult to reach areas and the GOP is supporting areas that are easier to access.  However, preliminary field reports suggest some difficulties with the handover process. NGOs have expressed frustration over the fact that the GOP has not effectively communicated the division of responsibilities to beneficiaries, leading to confusion among the population and unmet expectations.  12. In Mansehra, where WFP has handed over food assistance responsibility to the GOP, NGOs are particularly frustrated with the closure of WFP's office, which has left the logistics, food and nutrition, and information technology clusters without leadership.  WFP is now handling NWFP operations from Ghari Habibullah but cluster meetings are still held in Mansehra.  Field staff from some of WFP's cooperating partners are also concerned that the GOP has not yet taken over food distribution in several areas in Mansehra since WFP's departure.  13. In one example of NGO frustration, in Bagh District, AJK, USAID implementing partner GOAL was providing food and shelter assistance in eight union councils prior to the shift in operational areas.  As parts of Bagh District now fall under the GOP's operational area, GOAL ceded food responsibilities in five of the union councils to the GOP. However, GOAL is still implementing USAID shelter projects in these five union councils.  As GOAL is still present, but no longer providing food, GOAL's community mobilizers are receiving complaints.  GOAL reported that even the local Bagh Administrator and military representatives were not aware of the shift.  14. According to the USAID/DART FFPO, the disconnect between the decision to divide food aid areas and the local governments' knowledge of this decision is fairly universal in both NWFP and AJK.  At a December 9 food cluster meeting in Islamabad, humanitarian agencies recommended to the FRC that the GOP raise community awareness via radio campaigns. At the meeting, the FRC representative seemed surprised by NGO statements that local government and GOP military representatives on the ground were not aware of the new agreement.  He stated that although the local government should spread the message at the district level, the FRC Commissioner could also make a radio address.  15. The USAID/DART FFPO is currently in Mansehra, and is meeting with a range of humanitarian actors to assess the food situation and address questions raised regarding food distribution responsibilities.

More than two months into the earthquake relief effort, the UN has made some improvements in response to early criticisms of start-up delays and performance issues reported in ref A.  However, a lack of overall UN leadership, poor coordination, and insufficient staff continues to undermine the Pakistan earthquake response.  Most urgently, the UN should deploy a disaster expert to oversee the entire UN humanitarian operation. End summary.  ------------------------ Overview of the Response ------------------------  2. The humanitarian community marshaled massive resources to respond to the devastating October 8 earthquake in Pakistan. Overwhelming humanitarian needs, difficult terrain, and harsh winter weather conditions make the response particularly challenging.  There were also a large number of stakeholders, including numerous donors, humanitarian agencies, and GOP officials.  3. Rather than deploying a disaster expert to supervise multi-UN agency efforts at the start of the earthquake response, the UN Resident Coordinator who was already overseeing the UN Development Program,s portfolio in Pakistan became the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (UNHC).  The deployment of OCHA,s Director for Coordination and Response Kevin Kennedy was a welcome step to pull together the efforts of UN agencies more effectively, but Mr. Kennedy,s tenure in Pakistan was too brief.  4. The UN also piloted a &cluster lead8 system to replace the &collaborative approach8 of informal sectoral working groups that had been employed in previous emergencies.  Under the cluster system, agencies are appointed as leads to represent the interests of and formally develop a strategy for an entire sector.  Therefore, the cluster response places heavy demands on staff time for meetings and planning, taking away from operations.  Cluster leads are also failing to communicate and coordinate among themselves, which is hampering an integrated response.  While it may be too late to abandon the cluster approach in Pakistan, the UN needs leadership to pull together the cluster leads to ensure more information-sharing and cohesion among and across the sectors.  --Coordination and Information Management--  5. Undermining UN coordination and information sharing is the inadequate staffing of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  In particular, OCHA,s Humanitarian Information Center (HIC) has insufficient staff to manage and respond to large-scale information needs. According to its mandate, the HIC serves as the primary information collection point and gathers information submitted voluntarily by NGOs, other UN agencies, and the GOP.  Cluster leads are responsible for submitting sector information to the HIC; however, they have not yet developed standardized reporting formats.    Without enough HIC staff, there is no comprehensive information management system, and competing and often contradictory information streams have emerged.   ---------------------------------- Progress of Individual UN Agencies ----------------------------------  --Relief commodities--  7. There were significant early logistical problems managing air cargo shipments arriving at Islamabad Airport (Ref A). These have receded with improved inventory of incoming goods, and the slowdown in the number of airlifts arriving.  One remaining concern is that current UNJLC procedures do not identify transportation missions according to urgency of need but by location and access.  As a result, transportation is logical and efficient, but may fail to consider time sensitivity.  8. A UN Operational Data Management Team is now being formed to collect information systematically about the commodities pipeline. The arrival of a new UNJLC head on December 13 may also improve information collection and dissemination.  --WFP Food Assistance--  9. WFP has made progress since ref A and the food aid pipeline is healthy.  WFP field staff is dedicated and knowledgeable; in general, WFP and its cooperating partners are doing a competent and sometimes innovative job.  One concern is that WFP may have too quickly passed its responsibility to the GOP in Mansehra.  NGOs there are frustrated with the closure of WFP,s office, which has temporarily left the logistics, food and nutrition, and information technology clusters without leadership.  --Essential Services--  10. UNICEF staff have demonstrated strong technical skills in the water and sanitation sector.  Some UNICEF staff have shown more initiative than others, but have generally coordinated well with local government officials and the overall effort has been satisfactory to very good.  One concern is that UNICEF field staff are overstretched and unable to monitor closely projects in such a large coverage area.  To augment UNICEF efforts, the USAID/DART provided technical assistance to repair the damaged well at Mehra camp.  USAID also funded two staff positions through an NGO partner to provide surge capacity and oversight of water and sanitation activities.  11. The Camp Management Cluster lead, UNHCR, has doubled its camp management budget and increased the number of personnel and teams in the field per ref B.  To date, UNHCR has received USD 30 million in contributions, which is sufficient to cover camp management through March 2006, when the FRC and UNHCR plan to close camps. --------------------------- Comment and Recommendations ---------------------------  12. Overall, UN agencies have made progress since the early days of the response.  The deployment of experienced staff including Kevin Kennedy, and WFP Chief of Logistics Service, Amer Daoudi, led to significant improvements in UN operations.  The UN Secretary General, as well as directors from UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO traveled to Pakistan in the past two months, helped to rally agencies, efforts. Post also welcomes the announcement of former President Bush as Special Envoy for the South Asia Earthquake Disaster to pressure donors to honor pledges made in Geneva and Islamabad.  13. Although most individual agencies have shown improvement since ref A, the lack of sufficient staff and poor overall coordination continue to undermine the earthquake response. Post recommends the following:  a) The UN should immediately deploy a disaster expert to assume the role of the UNHC and oversee the entire UN operation.  Post recommends conveying this recommendation to the UN Secretary General, possibly through former President Bush.  At present, there is no leadership to hold the cluster leads accountable and ensure that information is shared between the field to headquarters and across different clusters.  The UNHC also needs special authorities for procurement and staffing.  b) Introduction of the cluster system concept was inappropriate for this major disaster response.  At this stage, it is too late to abandon the cluster approach, but the situation would improve by deploying UN staff with disaster experience and improving decision making authority for cluster leads. c) The HIC lacks sufficient staff to manage and disseminate incoming data.  Competing systems must be streamlined to better prioritize immediate interventions, identify gaps, and avoid duplication of efforts. CROCKER

A USAID/DART update of the water and sanitation situation in Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) is reported septel.  End Summary.  --------------------------------------------- --- Addressing Water and Sanitation Problems in NWFP --------------------------------------------- ---  2. USAID/DART WSOs are currently based at the US Embassy's Forward Operating Bases in Mansehra, NWFP, and Muzaffarabad, AJK, to monitor water and sanitation conditions in the earthquake zone and ensure adequate water and sanitation to prevent environmental health risks.  A USAID/DART WSO has been conducting assessments and providing technical guidance to agencies implementing emergency water and sanitation programs.  WSO recommendations have emphasized correcting critical gaps in community water and sanitation systems, and supporting field coordination.  3. As reported reftel, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) is coordinating water and sanitation issues in the affected areas of NWFP, with priority on interventions in camps. Mehra tent camp, located one hour north of Batagram on the Indus River, is currently the largest planned camp in the earthquake zone, with an estimated population of 16,000. The GOP has planned for Mehra to accommodate up to 30,000 people.  According to the USAID/DART, the camp growth rate is declining, but may increase if weather conditions worsen in the higher elevations of the Allai Valley.  4. The USAID/DART WSO reports that UNICEF's coordination of water and sanitation activities in Mehra has generally been good.  However, initial camp latrines built by contractors collapsed due to poor construction.  Following an assessment of Mehra, the USAID/DART WSO worked with the GOP military and UNICEF to upgrade the latrine design, supervise repairs of collapsed latrines, and oversee the construction of new ones.  In addition, the WSO established a construction tracking system to assure an adequate number of latrines were built to stay ahead of population increases at Mehra and other camps.  UNICEF is working with a new contractor, Solidarites, to construct latrines and maintain existing ones.  5. Another concern in Mehra Camp was the reduced supply of drinking water due to technical problems with the camp's well.  In response, the WSO provided guidance on proper well operation and arranged for US military electricians to rewire the control box.  Currently, the well is operating at full capacity.  To assure that water supplies remained adequate, the WSO advised the camp management to construct a second well.  This process is underway as of December 24. The WSO also worked directly in planning and implementation of backup water delivery to other camps.  --------------------------- Providing Technical Support ---------------------------  6. Since arriving in Mansehra, the USAID/DART WSO has actively engaged with UN agencies, NGOs, and local GOP officials on water and sanitation issues, especially in the interagency cluster meetings in Balakot and Batagram.  One important intervention by the WSO was focusing the cluster to support local authorities in conducting assessments and identifying priorities for reconstruction.  During December, the WSO accompanied GOP engineers on assessments in 35 destroyed and severely damaged communities.  USAID partners International Medical Corps (IMC) and ACTED have arranged for transport of materials to targeted communities.  The WSO has also coordinated with UNICEF, IMC, and ACTED for interventions in Paras, where people are reportedly drinking water from the river.  7. According to the USAID/DART, UNICEF field staff have demonstrated strong technical skills in the water and sanitation sector, but are overstretched and unable to monitor closely projects in such a large coverage area.  To augment UNICEF efforts, USAID funded two additional staff positions through NGO partner IMC to provide surge capacity and additional oversight of water and sanitation activities. One staff member is already on the ground and working on UNICEF water and sanitation activities.  8. To support sanitation activities and improve health surveillance, the USAID/DART WSO has been collaborating with partner agencies on disease reporting to monitor conditions, particularly in more densely populated camps.  The WSO has arranged for waterborne hygiene disease reporting to support the water and sanitation clusters.  Maintaining disease reports allow agencies to remain current on trends and provide advanced indication of potential outbreaks.  The WSO has collaborated with the UN World Health Organization (WHO) to provide "early warning" information to field cluster meetings.  9. Sanitation and hygiene promotion are critical activities for curbing the spread of disease in urban and densely populated camps.  Managing the use of latrines, as well as providing facilities with warm water for washing during the winter months are current priorities, especially in unorganized camps.  To support improved hygiene and bathing, the WSO met with partner NGO Action Contre La Faim (ACF) and the UN Development Program (UNDP) to review a plan for heating water and setting aside a bathing area in camps. The WSO has provided recommendations to modify the program that ACF plans to initiate in Balakot.  CROCKER

Effective information management, implemented from the earliest stages of a natural disaster, can improve the quality of the humanitarian response.  In the Pakistan earthquake, the UN introduced the cluster system without providing supporting documentation or comprehensive terms of reference and without internal information management capacity.  The UN clusters did not prioritize data collection and information management, and disaster specific information strategies were not implemented by UN agencies immediately following the disaster.  Information management at the cluster level remains an ongoing problem, and the UN's Humanitarian Information Center (HIC), which is responsible for providing technical advice and promoting data collection standards for the humanitarian community, currently does not have the staff or resources to assist. To strengthen the HIC and more effectively guide cluster- level management of information vital to relief and reconstruction efforts, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) recommends that donors, including USAID, provide two liaison officers and a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialist in the HIC specifically to work with the clusters.  End summary.  ------------------------------------ Importance of Information Management ------------------------------------  2. Effective information management during disasters is achieved by understanding what information decision-makers need in order to effectively steer the emergency response. The process begins with analysis: what do we need to know, how often do we need to know it, how can this information be made operational, who is responsible for the data management, what products will be produced, to whom will it be reported, what format will we use to collect the data, who will do the data collection, where will it be done, and what kind of training will we provide to support this process?  A critical step to managing information effectively is to prioritize the process early in a disaster so information management becomes an effective tool to support decision-making throughout the response. Lastly, information management strategies should be developed in advance of disasters and then modified to fit the circumstances of the disaster rather than being developed during the course of the disaster.  3. One essential component of information management, particularly in a disaster, is geo-referenced data used to build maps that make sense of a chaotic situation.  To determine gaps in coverage, it is essential to understand which geographical areas are covered and by which humanitarian agencies.  The Pakistan earthquake response demonstrated the importance for geo-referenced data; the lack of spatial coordinates for critical locations has hampered the response.  Less than half of the 300 known displaced person camps (spontaneous and planned) are geo- referenced.  As a result, the humanitarian community does not have a standard list of the exact locations of each camp.  In a recent shelter survey of 3,000 locations conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which is the head of the Emergency Shelter Cluster, surveyors did not collect coordinates, making it difficult to independently verify the results.  --------------------------------------------- -- Agencies and Organizations Managing Information --------------------------------------------- --  4. Presently, several agencies are primarily involved with information management in the Pakistan Earthquake response:  a) The UN Humanitarian Information Center (HIC) - The HIC is a common service to the humanitarian community and provides orientation products including contact lists and meeting schedules as well as map products.   The HIC initiated and continues to host weekly meetings for GIS users and information managers to coordinate efforts and prevent duplication of efforts.  During this disaster, the HIC has been unfairly blamed for not providing information management for the Clusters.  However, although the HIC has the responsibility for providing technical advice and promotion of standards for the humanitarian community to help them manage data and information more effectively, it is not responsible for data collection and internal information management within the clusters.  That is the responsibility of the UN cluster heads.  b) UN Cluster Heads - As reported reftel, the UN Cluster system was introduced in Pakistan without first establishing internal information management support in the clusters.  As a result, many clusters failed to establish an effective data collection system for information management within the cluster.  When it became increasingly apparent that information was needed for decision making, the clusters initiated several uncoordinated and competing requests for data several weeks after the earthquake.  Some hubs developed their reporting independently using non- standardized data collection forms-a situation that hindered uniform information analysis of all hub data.  c) The UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) - UNJLC is a common service frequently co-located with the HIC.  In Pakistan, the HIC and UNJLC were not co-located, but had strong collaboration, particularly among GIS staff.  UNJLC works on pipeline data and provides logical support to the humanitarian community.  d) ACTED - A USAID-funded international NGO, ACTED set up and managed an information management and GIS system that was exemplary in its effectiveness.  ACTED has used information management as part of their operations for several years.  For the Pakistan earthquake, they were able to bring information management staff from existing operations in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.  e) US Military - The US Military Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) information managers and GIS specialists coordinate with the USAID/DART and the humanitarian community and attend weekly meetings held at the HIC.  The DAC has made a commendable effort to reconcile data and share unclassified products; unclassified information has been essential since it is more accessible to a wider audience.  f) USAID/DART - The USAID/DART GIS Coordinator, from the U.S. Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit, worked in an advisory role with the HIC, represented the USAID/DART at information management meetings, and met with implementing partners to address information management and other issues.  The USAID/DART collected standardized data on partner location, activities, coverage of assessed shelter and emergency relief item needs, commodities in the pipeline and materials distributed.  The international NGOs were extremely helpful in these exercises.  Data was shared with the HIC and UNJLC.  h) The GOP Federal Relief Commission (FRC) - The FRC hired an information management consulting firm to install an operations center at the Prime Minister's Secretariat and to provide guidance in information management.  Although the operations center was completed, FRC indicated they did not have funding to staff the center.  During meetings at the FRC, the humanitarian community provided data and information to the FRC and requested information from the Pakistani military on their relief activities.  The FRC was unable to provide this, at least partly due to the fact that each of the three battalions working in the response use different non-standardized reporting formats.  Although the HIC made a strong effort to resolve this problem, only summary information has been received from the FRC to date.  ------------------------------------------ Information Management Gaps and Shortfalls ------------------------------------------  5. In early December, the head of the Emergency Shelter Cluster suggested the creation of a Strategic Information Cell (SIC) in the HIC to achieve closer integration of data collection and management.  It was proposed that FRC, UNJLC, and the Emergency Shelter Cluster provide staff. However, the SIC concept was abandoned by the Emergency Shelter Cluster head after three weeks of discussion.  6. Several agencies are working to identify and analyze gaps in the shelter and emergency relief item pipeline.  On November 26, the FRC issued a report that provided some information regarding the total amount of relief commodities distributed thus far.  The report did not, however, provide information on what commodities were available or needed.  7. On December 10, UNJLC asked donors to share emergency relief item data from their NGOs in order to determine the amount of emergency relief items in-country and in the pipeline.  The request did not provide a standardized reporting format so the information returned required tremendous effort to consolidate.  UNJLC entered all of the information in a Logistics Support Software (LSS) database to enable analysis.  At present, the data entry process is still ongoing and by the time it is completed, the information will be dated.  Additionally, accuracy of UNJLC's tracking is an issue as UNJLC relies on humanitarian agencies to supply and update commodity information.  As UNJLC has not yet instituted a standardized reporting format, it is likely that they will continue to receive non-standardized data. 8. Poor information management leads to multiple and non- coordinated requests that fall heavily on the international NGOs.  Many have complained that it is increasingly burdensome to try to meet the multiple information requests from hubs, clusters, donors, and offices such as HIC and UNJLC.  --------------- Recommendations ---------------  9. There continue to be urgent information management needs to effectively manage the humanitarian relief operation through the winter.  If not addressed, the lack of effective management systems and geo-referenced data will also negatively impact the transition from relief to reconstruction.  At present, there are no information management officers at the HIC to liaise between the clusters and the HIC.  Based on respective expertise, the USAID/DART recommends that USAID provide a GIS specialist and the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) provide two liaison officers to the HIC to work with the clusters to improve information management and provide timely processing of data.  The USAID/DART has begun to discuss this idea with DFID representatives in Islamabad.  CROCKER

(S/NF) Post welcomes intiative described reftel to target prominent inciters of terrorist acts.  Should these test cases prove successful, we believe that a number of individuals from terrorist and militant organizations in Pakistan would make appropriate targets for future consideration.  Post looks forward to consultation with Department on derivation of other possible designees under this provision.  2. (S/NF) While Muhammad Adil Khan is not/not one of the senior Harakatul Mujahidden or Harakat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami leaders, we believe that he continues to play a critical role for these (and possibly other terrorist/militant organizations) as a fundraiser and recruiter.  Sufficiently strong ties (reftel) clearly exist for his designation as a prominent inciter of terrorism.  Post does not believe that the GOP would have any strong objections to Adil Khan's designation per se.  Both HUM and HUJI are banned by the GOP and operatives from each were detained as part of Musharraf's crackdown on extremist organizations.  The GOP may, however, object to the overall notion of designating prominent inciters.  It has historically pressed for relatively narrow parameters for designation (likely hoping to keep some prominent Kashmiri groups and individuals from the lists). We have no reason to believe that designation would unduly raise Adil Khan's prominence.  His publicized deportation from the United States has already made him a well-known figure in extremist circles, and we do not believe designation would increase his following.  3. (S/NF) It is unclear what specific impact the solitary designation of Adil Khan would have on either HUJI or HUM operations.  Adil Khan's activities on behalf of these organizations are already theoretically banned under Pakistani law.  Most fundraising operations are conducted in cash and would not be easily traceable by law enforcement for seizure.  In addition, we are uncertain that the GOP would aggressively pursue Adil Khan's personal assets, and we have no evidence that he has significant seizable assets in other countries.  For this reason, we would strongly urge that this designation go forward only as the first in a series of sanctions against HUM and HUJI officials designed to maintain pressure on these organizations.

Visas: Everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  5.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  6.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  7.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section, or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled  ISLAMABAD 00003253  002 OF 004   departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  8.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  9.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  10. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services:  NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED).  TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  ISLAMABAD 00003253  003 OF 004    Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after  ISLAMABAD 00003253  004 OF 004   dark.  CROCKER

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 003542  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/2016 TAGS: AF, MARR, MASS, MCAP, MOPS, PK, PREL, PTER SUBJECT: 15TH PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN-U.S. TRIPARTITE MEETING  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1. (C) Summary: The 15th U.S.-Afghanistan-Pakistan Tripartite Commission meeting, held at Bagram on February 25, was characterized by frank discussion between the Afghan and Pakistani delegations.  The agenda focused on cross-border issues, intelligence sharing, steps to counter IEDs, and the link between enhancing security, governance and reconstruction.  Participants noted that the open discussion was a sign of the usefulness of the Tripartite Commission and of growing comfort levels between Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, but both delegations emphasized the need to cultivate trust as the key enabler for continued progress. (Contrary to press reports, the Pakistanis did not cite the Bajaur incident, though their allusion to "increased border violations" was clearly a reference to the incident.  The U.S. response "noted" Pakistan's concerns, while emphasizing the need to take effective measures to counter the threat posed by the common enemy.)  End summary.  2. (C) On February 25, Afghan, Pakistani and U.S. military representatives met at Bagram for the 15th Tripartite Commission meeting.  The Pakistani delegation was led by Major General Yousef, Director General of Military Operations, and the Afghan delegation by ANA Chief of Operations Lieutenant General Karimi.  The U.S. delegation was led by CFC-A Commander Lieutenant General Eikenberry. The NATO-ISAF observer was Brigadier General Tabor, Special Advisor to the NATO-ISAF Commander.  Khowst officials, including the Governor and his provincial police chief, the RC East Commander, the Khowst PRT Commander, and PRT civilian representatives from State and USAID participated via a VTC link.  Presentations were made by the Chairs of the Border Security Sub-committee, the Counter-IED Working Group, and the Military Intelligence Sharing Working Group.  3. (C) The focus of the 15th tripartite was civil-military affairs, including enhanced military-military cooperation and the importance of improving security through reconstruction and governance on both sides of the border.  Briefing topics included a US presentation on how PRTs function, and a following briefing focused specifically on Khowst province, with a range of Khowst officials offering their insights on civil/military cooperation.  The Pakistan delegation provided an in-depth briefing on its three-tiered (military-political-development) strategy in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  Beyond civ/mil issues, the delegations had in-depth discussions on ways to enhance intelligence sharing and to deepen cooperation on combating IEDs.  The NATO observer briefed on NATO transition in Afghanistan.  Countering IEDs ---------------  4. (S) Discussions began with a substantive exchange on strategies to counter the growing threat of IEDs.  It was agreed that a common database of the types of IEDs used/found should be developed.  Both sides underscored the need for improved intelligence sharing in creating this database.  The Pakistani side pointed out that a lack of technical capability in protecting forces against IEDs weakens Pakistan's ability to manage the growing use of IEDs.  Afghan representatives noted that as the majority of casualties from IEDs are civilians, engaging border area inhabitants on both sides through a public information campaign to teach civilians to identify an IED and to notify authorities would be useful.  The session ended with LTG Eikenberry emphasis on the need to attack all nodes of the IED employment and attack cycle by aligning counter-IED efforts into a comprehensive framework that incorporates intelligence, public engagement and information, attack against IED cells, TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures), force protection, and exploitation. Pointing to an example of the relationship  ISLAMABAD 00003542  002 OF 003   between security and development (the theme of the talks), LTG Eikenberry noted that in Konar Province, the paving of a stretch of road had dramatically reduced the volume of IED attacks.  Intelligence Sharing --------------------  5. (S) After a briefing on the last meeting of the Military Intelligence Sharing Working Group, Pakistani Director of Military Intelligence, Brigadier General Reza Muhammad, stated that intelligence that was neither timely nor actionable, no matter how well-shared, was akin to having a "doctor after death."  The Afghan side responded that they often provide actionable intelligence -- especially regarding the location of Taliban and Al Qaeda in Pakistani territory and the use of madrassas as recruitment centers -- but they rarely see results.  Both sides emphasized the need for greater intelligence sharing at the tactical level and faster response times to take maximum advantage of opportunities for action against insurgents or drug traffickers.  Continued Cross-Border Violations ---------------------------------  6. (S) Pakistani and Afghan delegations discussed continued cross-border movement )- in both directions -- of insurgents, arms, and drugs. The Pakistani delegation cited cases of Afghan weapons smuggled into Balochistan and the flow of "miscreants" from Afghanistan into Pakistan.  The Afghan side noted examples of Pakistani citizens in Afghanistan caught planning suicide bombings in Kandahar and Taliban insurgents arrested entering Afghanistan.  Pakistani officials responded with assurances that the over 80,000 Pakistani soldiers in the frontier tribal areas were prepared to respond to useful intelligence passed to them, and that Pakistani forces are tightening border passage to Afghanistan.  With scanners and passports, cross border movement could be even more restricted.  The Pakistani delegation also noted an increase in border violations by Coalition Forces since the last Tripartite meeting in December.  (Note: Contrary to press reports, the Bajaur incident was not specifically mentioned, though this was likely the intended reference.  The US response was to &note, Pakistan's complaint while emphasizing the need to take effective measures to counter the threat posed by the common enemy.)  Building Security Through Reconstruction ----------------------------------------  7. (C) All participants agreed that reconstruction and economic and political development are crucial to improving security in the border areas.  Pakistani Director of Military Operations, Brigadier General Nasser Janjua, presented a comprehensive Pakistan strategy for improving security in the FATA through military,  political and development means.  The CFC-A Regional Command ) East Commander, Colonel Pat Donahue the Governor of Khowst, Merajoddin Pathan, and the Khowst PRT Commander Lieutenant Colonel Sammons presented a similar three-pronged strategy for improving security and enhancing development in that province.  LTG Eikenberry noted the similarities of these strategies and encouraged greater Pakistani-Afghan coordination and collaboration in these efforts to improve conditions on both sides of the border, pointing out that tribes and clans span both sides of a common border, thus necessitating a common strategy. LTG Eikenberry's Wrap-Up and Proposals --------------------------------------  8. (S) LTG Eikenberry closed the meeting with three proposals for the Pakistan delegation (already vetted and approved by the ANA delegation).  He announced that CJTF-76 is presently planning "Operation Mountain Lion", a coordinated Afghan-CFC  ISLAMABAD 00003542  003 OF 003   spring offensive against the Taliban.  He suggested that the Pakistan Army be included in aspects of the operational planning with the aim of achieving common effects on both sides of the border. The second proposal was that the Tripartite's successful Border Security Subcommittee be expanded to RC South starting in April and include participation by the Canadian RC South Multi-National Brigade Commander.  The Pakistani side welcomed this idea, but indicated on the margins of the meeting that it is unsure if the counterpart would be the Frontier Corps or 12th Corps, pointing out that unlike 11th Corps stationed in Peshawar, 12th Corps was not deployed along the Afghan-Pakistan border.  They will consider options and re-engage.  LTG Eikenberry's third proposal was that NATO representation at the April tripartite in Pakistan be upgraded and that NATO become a full Tripartite member in June, sharing  the third leg of the Tripartite with CFC -) in the run up to NATO Stage three transition in the South later in the summer and stage four thereafter.  These proposals met with approval in principle, with details to be worked out. Both delegations concurred with the CFC proposal to backbrief the results of the mid-March AFG-PAK Mil seminar at the Marshall center in Germany on common security issues -) the first in a series of planned conferences aimed at developing common perspectives on security and nurturing personal and professional relationships among Pakistani and Afghan officers at the 05 and 06 (Lt Col and colonel) levels.  Two dates were suggested for the next Tripartite Commission meeting (a 4-star event)in Islamabad: April 11-13 or April 18-20.  Comments --------  9. (S) The 15th Tripartite Commission meeting highlighted the Afghans' frustration over continued IED and suicide attacks in Afghanistan, and their conviction that Pakistan could do more.  Though LTG Karimi did his best to reframe their observations in diplomatic terms, his DGMI and the Governor of Khowst delivered tough messages.  The Pakistanis responded by defending their efforts and going on the offensive, challenging the Afghans to do more to combat gun-running into Balochistan and narcotics trafficking.  The discussion was frank but the tone was controlled throughout and the sides parted with embraces at end of the session.  More importantly, over the past months the concept of a common enemy has taken firm root in underpinning the need for these discussions.  Afghans and Pakistanis also recognize the fragility of the relationship, given the inherent lack of trust.  The problem of trust can be overcome to the extent exchanges like these generate action on each side, and also through tangible successes such as those produced by the Border Security Subcommittee and, prospectively, by cooperation in Operation Mountain Lion.  Still, improved military operational effectiveness must be achieved in the coming year or the Tripartite Talks will be seen by the Afghan side as without substance.  10. (S) Considerable progress is being made in setting the stage for expanded Coalition-Afghan-Pakistani military coordination across the Balochistan border (i.e. CFC-A Regional Command ) South, Afghan National Army 205th Corps, and either the Pakistan army's 12th Corps or the Frontier Corps), as well as for a seamless NATO-ISAF transition into the lead international military position in the Tripartite Talks.  This will be important for the Coalition and NATO, as well as key individual nations (UK, Canada, etc.) during the upcoming command changes in Afghanistan.  Offers to exchange liaison officers (LNOs) initiated outside of the Tripartite framework risk confusing Kabul and Islamabad, and undermining their confidence in the continuity and coherence of the process.

Pakistani politicians at all levels--from President Musharraf and PM Aziz to a wide-spectrum of political party representatives--have reached out to US Embassy and Consulate officials to offer their condolences and express their condemnation of the 2 March bombing outside of the US Consulate General in Karachi. Reactions have been uniform, regretting the loss of lives, vehemently critical of the bomber's actions,  and simultaneously concerned about the bombing's impact on Pakistan's image abroad. End Summary.  REGRET, SORROW, AND ANGER FROM MOST POLITICAL PARTIES... --------------------------------------------- --------- 2. Publicly and privately, a spectrum of the Mission's political and civil society contacts have reached out to express their sincere grief over the death of Karachi Consulate personnel. Several called in to express "sincere condolences" and concern over the continuing "menace" of terrorism and sabotage on Pakistan's public image.  Others used the media to convey their condolences and their anger at those responsible for the attack. Thus far, condolence calls have come in from over 25 officials but there has been a notable absence from JI and PML-N thus far. A snapshot of callers includes:        --President Musharraf       --Punjab Chief Minister Pervaiz Elahi, PML       --Punjab Governor Khalid Maqbool       --Makhdoom Amin Fahim, Chairperson of the PPP       --PML Secretary General Mushahid Hussain       --Riyaz Fatiyana, PML MNA       --Kashmala Tariq, PML MNA       --Mufti Abrar Ahmed, Private Secretary to Maulana Fazlur Rahman (Jamait-e Ulema-e Islam Fazlur Rehman Faction)       --Sahibzada Abdul Khair Muhammad Zubair, VP Jamait-e Ulema-e Pakistan       --Jalal Naqvi, Tehrik-e Islami Pakistan       --Inayat Ali Shakir, Tehrike Akhuwat-e Islami Pakistan (Shia)       --Mufti Munib-ur Rehman, President, Tanzeem-ul Madaris (Barelvi madrassa board)       --Mehboob Sada, Christian Studies Center       --Om Parkash Narain, Chairman, Pakistan Minorities Forum   ...AND CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN'S IMAGE ------------------------------------ 3. Government politicians and several civil society representatives also pointedly noted in their messages their concern that the bombings could further tarnish Pakistan's delicate image abroad or harm US-Pakistan relations. President Musharraf and PM Aziz both made a point of telling reporters that the "sensless acts" would not deter Pakistan's fight against terrorism and expressed concern that the terorists were "defaming" Pakistan's soft image.  PML Law and Justice Minister Wasi Zafar said that the bombing was intended to sabotage President Bush's visit to Pakistan, and told reporters that the bombing reinforced the fact that "the menace of terrorism needs to be wiped out." Lastly, Sindh Chief Minister Ishrat-ul Abad and Governor Ghulam Arbab Rahim told reporters to "tell the world that no Muslim considers terrorism a correct path." CROCKER

MAIER - QUINN EMAIL MAIL 06 MARCH 06      B. B. LAMBERT - ENGLEKEN EMAIL 21 FEB 06  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S)  After reviewing the time line presented in ref A and B for moving forward with the UN 1267 and domestic terrorism finance designation of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) as an alter-ego of current terrorism finance designee Lashkar-e-Tayyba (LeT), Ambassador requests a two-week delay in pre-notificaion, presentation to the UN 1267 Committee and in the domestic designation.  Post's preferred timeline is:  -- pre-notification:  no earlier than 30 March -- request to UN 1267 Committee:  no earlier than 15 April -- domestic action:  no earlier than 15 April  2.  (S)  Post's reasoning for requesting this delay is based solely on force-protection considerations.  DAC-PAK personnel will continue flying helicopter sorties in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Pakistan-administered Kashmir (AJK) until the end of March; ground support personnel will be deployed in Muzaffarabad, AJK as long as the helicopters are flying.  By the end of the first week of April, U.S. military personnel will have redeployed from NWFP and AJK to the Islamabad area, awaiting onward tranport out of Pakistan.  In order not to increase the risk to our military personnel as they conclude their successful mission to Pakistan, post recommends that no action on the JuD designation be taken until all DAC-PAK operations have concluded and DAC personnel are in the Islamabad area.

UNCLAS ISLAMABAD 003754  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, OTRA, PK SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR US GOVERNORS DELEGATION  REF: STATE 37316  1.  Post welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Gov. James Douglas, Gov. Kenny Guinn, Gov. Phil Bredesen, Gov. Tim Kaine, Maj. Gen. Summaral, Maj Patrick Lewis, Dan Wilmot, Claude Chafin and Ltc. John Schroeder for March 15 and 16. The purpose of the visit is to transit Pakistan.  2.  Control officer for the visit will be Mohammed Motiwala. He can be reached at the following numbers: Embassy: 92-51-208-0000; Office: 92-51-208-2624; Cell: 0300-501-2202.  3.  The control officer will meet visitors upon arrival at the airport in Islamabad.  Please inform control officer of any change in itinerary.  4.   Visitors must/must obtain separate post clearance if they plan to visit any of the three Mission Pakistan consulates (Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore) or any other areas under the jurisdiction of the consulates.  Most travel outside of Islamabad will require separate post clearance. Post clearance for the consulates should be requested via cable to the consulate(s) on the planned itinerary.  5. Unless only transiting Pakistan, everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  6.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  7.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  8.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section, or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  9.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  10.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  11. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services:  NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED). TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.  CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 003804  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2021 TAGS: PGOV, KISL, KDEM, PK SUBJECT: CARTOONS FAIL TO UNITE OPPOSITION  REF: ISLAMABAD 3022 AND PREVIOUS  ISLAMABAD 00003804  001.2 OF 002   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1. (C) Summary:  For a brief moment, Pakistan's political opposition appeared poised to transform popular anger over the Danish cartoon issue into protests against the Musharraf government.  In the end, however, self-interest and government inducements have combined to split the divergent parties within the political opposition, diffuse the issue, and eliminate any potential threat to the sitting government.  The more moderate (and larger) secular and Islamist opposition parties, the Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F) refused to participate in the street tactics being advocated by their counterparts.  Absent their participation, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Pakistan Muslim Leaque - Nawaz (PML-N) protest strategy appears unlikely to be losing momentum.  End Summary.  2. (C) With anger over the Danish cartoons running high, JI sought to direct this anger against the Musharraf government.  Through proxies and in concert with the local leadership of the PML-N, it was responsible for early (and sometimes violent) protests in which demands for Musharraf's immediate resignation were part and parcel of the uprising.  JI convinced a skeptical PPP and JUI-F to participate in combined and individual party protests in Islamabad and Peshawar (the latter turning violent) and to frame the issue as a movement against their common enemy Musharraf.  At the high point of such protests, JI leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed publicly promised that a street movement would oust Musharraf by March 23, Pakistan National Day.  JI ruling council member Shahid Pervez told poloff that the party's strategy was to create a security situation such that the military would have to intervene, oust Musharraf, and install a popular caretaker government led by the political parties in advance of the 2007 elections.  Large-scale, nationwide demonstrations to coincide with the President Bush's visit were the focal point of this strategy.  3. (C) The violence in Peshawar appears to have been the first breaking point within the opposition alliance. According to JUI-F Foreign Relations Committee Chair former Ambassador Mohammad Jalalud-Din, the JUI-F, which controls the NWFP provincial government and was an active proponent of the protests, appears to have been caught off-guard by the scale of the violence and the central government's and public's strong reaction against it.  This, he claims, caused the JUI-F to reassess its strategy of supporting JI's street tactics.  Jalalud-Din admitted that JUI-F's primary goal was to retain the government in NWFP and that subtle threats by the GOP had accompanied their urging of a JUI-F change in tactics.  In addition, Jalalud-Din expressed doubt that a "security crisis" would result in military intervention to impose a civilian government.  Martial law, in his view, was the more likely outcome.  4. (C) According to PPPP Chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim, his party was never comfortable with the JI (and PML-N) protest strategy.  He stressed that the PPPP had purposely avoided participation in the Lahore demonstrations and had given only tacit support to the Islamabad demonstrations.  The party had organized its own protests in response to growing public condemnation of the cartoons and a need to burnish its "Islamic" credentials.  Fahim admitted, however, that the PPPP did not believe protests were the best way to achieve democratic change.  The PPPP ultimately broke with the JI on this issue after Benazir Bhutto personally instructed the party not to participate in protests against President Bush (septel).  Fahim claimed that the party would instead attempt negotiations with the GOP on a national unity government and/or necessary changes to ensure free and fair elections in 2007.  5. (C) Comment:  The Danish cartoon issue illustrates the  ISLAMABAD 00003804  002.2 OF 002   difficulties that the opposition faces in building a true anti-Musharraf coalition.  The smaller parties, JI and PML-N, believe that their interests lie in "embarassing" the Musharraf regime.  With little stake in the current structure and minimal possibility of a deal with the GOP, neither is concerned about negative government reaction to their tactics.  In contrast, the JUI-F (which holds the government in NWFP and is a coaltion partner in Balochistan) and the PPPP (which continues to believe that a deal with Musharraf is possible) are wary of undertaking any action that puts them too far at odds with Musharraf.  For these reasons, we believe that a united opposition anti-Musharraf coalition will continue to exist in name only for the foreseeable future, posing minimal threat to the sitting government.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ISLAMABAD 003807  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2016 TAGS: KDEM, MARR, MASS, MOPS, PGOV, PK, PREL, PTER SUBJECT: POLITICAL SCENESETTER FOR PM - A/S JOHN HILLEN  REF: STATE 36300  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (S) The U.S. Mission in Pakistan warmly welcomes your planned March 15 - 18 visit to Pakistan.  As demonstrated during President Bush's recent visit to Islamabad, both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz are western-oriented modernizers who are trying to move Pakistan toward Musharraf's goal of "enlightened moderation."  They viewed the President's visit as a landmark in the relationship and were gratified that he decided stay overnight in Pakistan.  Your visit comes as Pakistan's leaders are trying to contain the fallout from the Danish cartoon controversy, while simultaneously suppressing violent separatists in Balochistan, combating al-Qa'ida and extremists in the Tribal Areas along the Afghan border and guiding earthquake recovery operations.  The government remains fully engaged in earthquake recovery operations, with attention turning from emergency relief toward long-term reconstruction.  Robust USG participation in the earthquake relief effort will help promote a more positive public perception of the United States in what has long been a tough public diplomacy environment, helping us advance key U.S. objectives, including democratization, regional stability and progress in the global war on terror.  The Cartoon Controversy -----------------------  2. (C) Over the past month, tens of thousands of Pakistani demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest the publication of the Danish cartoons.  Early rallies in Lahore and Peshawar were particularly destructive, with rampant looting and vandalism in parts of downtown Lahore and Peshawar and six protesters killed.  Although more demonstrations throughout Pakistan followed (including a widely-observed nationwide strike on the day of President Bush's arrival), enhanced security measures by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has prevented any repetition of the unrestrained violence seen in February.  Over time, the protests have taken on a greater political tone.  The outrage against the Danes and the EU still festers, but opportunistic politicians have attempted to subvert public sentiment in order to condemn the West as a whole (including the U.S.) and to embarrass the Musharraf government.  3.  (C) Following President Bush's lead, your visit presents an opportunity to remind the Pakistani people that the United States understands the sentiments of the Muslim community and that, while we strongly support freedom of expression, we also believe the press should behave responsibly.  More broadly, it will be an opportunity to underscore our desire for warm relations with the Muslim world and a sustained partnership with Pakistan as it addresses the long-term challenges of development and the immediate challenge of earthquake recovery.  Earthquake Relief -----------------  4. (U) The October 8 earthquake (7.6 on the Richter scale) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was the strongest to hit the region in over a century.  The GOP estimates that more than 73,000 individuals died in the quake, with more than 69,000 wounded and some 2.8 million survivors left homeless.  The United States has been Pakistan's most visible international partner in delivering emergency relief over the last two months.  5.  (U) The U.S. military has been on the ground since October 10.  At the peak of initial relief efforts, more than 1,200 personnel and 24 helicopters provided vital transport, logistics and medical and engineering support in affected areas.  As the emergency relief phase is coming to an end, we have closed the two U.S. military hospitals, turning over USD 2.5 million in medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts. Our Seabee unit has also departed Muzaffarabad, leaving behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineering units.  U.S. airlift operations will be phased out in late March.  6.  (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services in camps and villages.  USAID has provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to help the affected population make it through the harsh Himalayan winter.  USAID recently made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15  ISLAMABAD 00003807  002 OF 004   million to rebuild schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged USD 510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately USD 24 million.  Independent estimates place total U.S. private donations at over USD 130 million.  7.  (C) Our prompt and generous response has helped initiate a shift in Pakistani attitudes about the United States, qualitatively improving bilateral relations at official levels and sustaining the relationship during popular unrest surrounding the Danish cartoon controversy.  The hand-in-glove cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army.  As we have drawn down our military presence, we have emphasized that our transition parallels the overall shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort. Pakistanis, who have long been convinced that we are fair-weather friends, are beginning to understand that we are interested in a long-term relationship.  Democratization ---------------  8.  (C) President Musharraf has committed - publicly and privately - to move Pakistan toward a civilian-led democracy by the next national elections, which must be held by 2007. U.S. visitors should remind their Pakistani interlocutors (particularly those in the military) of the importance our elected leaders - including President Bush and members of Congress - attach to this transition.  The government must address significant organizational issues before the 2007 national elections, not least of which is an empowered and well-trained election commission.  As a first step, we have urged President Musharraf to appoint a permanent, independent Chief Election Commissioner who is acceptable to all mainstream parties.  When engaging Pakistani contacts, U.S. officials should reinforce the need for civilian control of the military and for the military's full and permanent disengagement from electoral politics.  At the operational level, USAID supports democratization efforts with programs to promote institutional development of the courts, the legislatures, and the political parties.  Afghanistan -----------  9.  (S) The roller-coaster relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan continues to suffer from mutual suspicion and recrimination, with Afghans concerned about cross-border infiltration and Pakistan worried that India is using its assets in Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  President Musharraf, his government and military leaders recognize that Pakistan must support the Karzai government as it attempts to solidify its control over the country.  To that end, the Government is committed to cooperating on operational security matters with the Afghan government and coalition forces through regular Tripartite Commission meetings.  10.  (S) As illustrated by the recent heavy fighting in North and South Waziristan, Pakistan is struggling to curb insurgent activity, challenged by rugged terrain, Pakistan border security forces' limited resources and sometimes uneven support within the Pakistani military, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps.  The greatest hurdle is the Government's lack of a coherent strategy in the Tribal Areas along the Afghan border.  We consistently press the GOP to move forcefully against al-Qaida, Taliban and other anti-coalition militants, while simultaneously acknowledging the significant progress Pakistan has made in countering terrorist elements since September 2001.  The recent military operations initiated in North Waziristan by Pakistan's Special Services Group, supported by Pakistan Army Aviation and 11th Corps assets, marks a new level of commitment commensurate with America expectations. For the first time since 2001, the Pakistan military may clearly see the challenge to sovereignty posed by foreign militants who have been allowed sanctuary in the Tribal Areas.  India and Kashmir -----------------  11.   (S) President Musharraf and his senior advisors have consistently told us that they have made a strategic decision to end the militancy and even Indian officials acknowledge that the level of violence and cross-border infiltration has declined (though New Delhi attributes this to Indian security measures).  President Musharraf believes the GOP's ability to  ISLAMABAD 00003807  003 OF 004   control Kashmiri militants will be greatly enhanced if there is measurable progress with India on Kashmir.  He has specifically pushed for a withdrawal of Indian forces from key population centers in Indian-administered Kashmir (a demand viewed with great skepticism in Delhi).  Musharraf has privately signaled flexibility on final status of Kashmir, but in public remains steadfast in rejecting the Line of Control (LOC) as a permanent international boundary.  While there has been little progress on these core issues relating to Kashmir, senior Indian and Pakistani officials meet regularly through the Composite Dialogue process, which has produced some confidence-building measures, including a pre-notification agreement for ballistic missile launches and the opening of five bus routes between the two countries.  12.  (C) Responding to widespread public opinion, the two governments agreed to open five new LOC crossing points and to permit cross-LOC cell phone service following the October 8 earthquake, to allow divided Kashmiri families the opportunity to comfort one another. These limited measures have the potential to changes the dynamic in Kashmir and may accelerate internal pressure on Islamabad and New Delhi to create additional space for interaction between Kashmiris in India and Pakistan.  13.  (S) India has long resisted the involvement of third parties in settling the Kashmir issue, and Pakistani leaders understand that any move toward a direct mediating role by the U.S. would be counterproductive.  President Musharraf was pleased by President Bush's even-handed statements about the need for good relations between India and Pakistan and for a peaceful and mutually agreeable solution in Kashmir.  Global War on Terrorism -----------------------  14.  (S) Pakistan deserves commendation for standing with us in the global war on terror, including its efforts against al-Qaida to deny safe haven to extremist elements in Pakistan's untamed Tribal Areas along the Afghan border. Following the GOP's decision to extend central government control into the Tribal Areas (historically a "no go" region for government forces), we have regularly encouraged Pakistani security forces to stay the course in the face of armed resistance.  The Pakistan military has suffered over 1000 casualties in the Tribal areas, with particularly heavy fighting in the first week of March, when militants occupied a key town in North Waziristan.  In recent months, the security situation, especially in Waziristan, has deteriorated, forcing the GOP to rethink its strategy. Musharraf has articulated a three-pronged approach comprising political initiatives, economic development and military operations that are faster, leaner and more targeted than in the past.  We have offered to assist Pakistan's economic development efforts in the Tribal Areas and to provide training and rapid strike capabilities as it realigns its military tactics.  15.  (C) In the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings, President Musharraf cracked down on terrorist/extremist organizations in Pakistan to much public fanfare.  We have reserved judgment on whether the President has the will to hold the line against Pakistan's extremist elements for the long run.  Initial law enforcement actions targeted the usual suspects -- conservative clerics and Islamist politicians -- prompting a strong popular backlash, with conservatives decrying the focus on Islamists.  Ultimately, the government released most detainees and watered down regulations intended to provide transparency on madrassa operations.  We have repeatedly pressed senior GOP officials to act decisively against the operational leaders of key terrorist and extremist groups.  We have also encouraged GOP officials to take action against madrassas that support, recruit for or shelter these organizations.  Balochistan -----------  16.  (S) Pakistani leaders are also struggling to cope with an insurgency in the resource-rich province of Balochistan, as local Baloch tribesmen seek to redress historic grievances against Pakistan and seize a greater share of their provincial patrimony.  President Musharraf has swung back and forth between civilian advisors who are counseling caution and a negotiated settlement that addresses Baloch concerns, and military advisors who view the insurgency as an Indian-sponsored threat to national unity to be suppressed. Currently, the pendulum appears to have swung toward the military option. This has clear implications for the  ISLAMABAD 00003807  004 OF 004   military's ability to pursue shared U.S.-Pakistan objectives in the Tribal Areas and in the war on terror.  Pakistani security forces are already over-stretched along the Afghan border, in North and South Waziristan, in earthquake relief and in managing domestic unrest over the cartoons.  An escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year.  CROCKER

(C) In a follow-up to the January 2nd "retirement" of 50 Senators (reftel A), Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) in each of Pakistan's four provinces were charged with electing replacements on March 6. Each Provincial Assembly elected 11 Senators in a secret-ballot overseen by the Provincial Election Commission; Senators from the Islamabad Capital Territory (1) and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (4) will be elected on March 10. The election saw the return of 20 Senators selected for retirement, as well as a slight gain of 5 seats for the ruling coalition (3 seats for the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and 2 for its coalition partner, the Muttahidda Quami Movement (MQM)). Among the opposition, the six-party Islamist alliance, the Muttahidda Majlis-e Ammal (MMA) won 10 seats (a loss of one from the previous election), the PPP won 5 (a loss of two seats), the middle-class Baloch National Party (NP) won its first seat, and the rest of the opposition picked up one seat each. Newly elected Senators will take the Oath of Office on Friday March 12.  WINNERS AND LOSERS: COALITION- 56, Opposition-39 --------------------------------------------- --- 2. (U) The following is a provincial breakdown of the outcome.  BALOCHISTAN (MMA loses one seat, NP gains a seat) --------- Ruling      PML   5 (Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali,Mir Mohabbat Khan Marri, Saeed Ahmad Khan Hashmi, Rehana Yaya Baloch)  MMA   3 (Mohammad Ismail, Sabina Rauf,Rehmatullah Kakar )  NP    1 (Abdul Malik Baloch)  Opposition  BNP-A 1 (Mir Isarullah Khan)  JWP   1 (Shahid Hussain Bugti)  PUNJAB: (PML gained two seats, PPP lost one seat) ------ Ruling      PML   9  (Sardar Mohammad Khan Leghari, Syed Javed Ali Shah, Javed Ashraf Qazi (Minister of       Education),Mohammad Ali Durrani, Naseem Chatha, S.

(C) Notably, there were few surprises among the winners and losers of the March 6th contest. Most parties had calculated ahead of time the number of seats they were likely to win, and awarded tickets accordingly. On the government side, the decision to dump Punjab Senators and Cabinet Members Shehzad Waseem and Dr. Hafiz Sheikh was made several weeks in advance. The same holds true for the PPPP decision to deny prominent party leader Dr. Abdullah Riar a ticket from Sindh. The GOP insisted the BNP-A deny troublesome Senator Mohim Khan Baloch a ticket as a condition of continued PML support to the party; his replacement is viewed as more pliable. As a condition of its MPAs' support to other nationalist parties, the NP insisted on support for one Senate Seat, a seat now held by former Provincial Education Minister Abdul Malik Baloch.  The surprise defeats came on the PPP side: in NWFP, well-regarded Farhatullah Babar was unable to fend off a concerted PML campaign for his seat, while in Punjab, former World Bank official Dr. Akhbar Khwaja lost his technocrat seat to a PML challenger. Babar's defeat, however, marks the political rebirth of former PML Secretary General Salim Saifullah, who gained a seat.  4. (C) Comment. Embassy contacts in both the ruling and opposition parties, as well as several English language newspapers indicate that the March 6 Senate election can be judged fair. It was held by secret-ballot and monitored by officials from both the Provincial Election Commissions and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) who traveled to each Province from Islamabad. The campaign process, however, was marred by allegations of illegal activities, including vote-buying and promises of development resources to MPAs by all sides. Overall, in the Embassy's judgement, the ruling coalition's slightly increased edge in the Senate will not have any significant policy or legislative impact. In the opposition, the PPP, however, may suffer in the medium-term from the loss of three of its more articulate, active members. CROCKER

March 1st and 2nd raids on militant training facilites by the Pakistan Special Operations Task Force (SOTF) in Miram Shah and Sedgai, North Waziristan led to the biggest clashes in the region in three years. The GOP military attacks and subsequent retaliatory strikes reportedly led by militant leaders Maulana Abdul Khaliq and Sadiq Noor--which included a one-day takeover of government buildings in Miram Shah-- have led to approximately 100 militant casualties and the death of four soldiers, according to GHQ. As of March 7th, Frontier Corps forces had largely regained control of Miram Shah, though militants are still engaged in attacks against military and government forces. Pakistani military spokesmen have blamed the porous Pakistan-Afghan border and what they are calling Afghanistan's inability to control the Taliban insurgents on its side of the border for the escalating military conflict in the Waziristan region. End Summary.  Strike Leads to Heavy Clashes ----------------------------- 2. (S//NF) On March 1, GHQ reports that the Pakistani SOTF raided a militant training compound near  Miram Shah. A day later, Pakistan military forces struck a militant training facility in Sedgai, North Waziristan. The March 2nd attack killed 35 "foreign fighters"--including "Arabs and Chechens" as well as 10 local facilitators, according to Interservices Public Relations Spokesman Shaukat Sultan. Militant leaders Maulvi Abdul Khaliq Haqqani and Maulana Sadiq Noor--who Pakistani military officials say have been spearheading attacks against Pakistani military forces and government officials since December--ordered an immediate retaliatory attack against Pakistani military forces in the Miram Shah area. During the attack, militant forces temporarily took control of some government buildings, and launched rockets against Pakistan military camps. GHQ reports that the attacks led to the death of one Army soldier and three Frontier Corps soldiers; they also damaged telephone and electricity infrastructure in Miram Shah.  3. (S//NF) The military has launched several raids, including on the compounds of Abdul Khaliq, Sadiq Noor, and Siraj Haqqani. Pakistani military officials indicate that up to 100 militants have been killed. On March 7, the North Waziristan Political Agent oversaw the demolition of Khaliq's madrassa in Miram Shah. Later that evening, he was nearly killed when his vehicle was ambushed while travelling on the main road from Miram Shah to Mir Ali.  4. (C) As of March 6, GHQ and North Waziristan Political Agent Zahir-ul Islam reported that the military had re-asserted control over Miram Shah, though pockets of resistence may remain. The political administration has enforced a curfew and cordon of Miram Shah, including suspending traffic on the main road between Miram Shah and Bannu. Peshawar contacts and press reports indicate that the populace of Miram Shah has emptied out into neighboring Bannu and Karak to avoid the fighting. The military is attempting to stop the exodus of local residents to Bannu, Mir Ali, Kohat, and DI Khan, fearing that militants may also find safe-haven in the "settled" areas of NWFP.  Background on Abdul Khaliq Haqqani and Saddiq Noor --------------------------------------------- ---- 5.(C) Several Pakistani press reports dating back to September and November 2005 tie Maulvi Abdul Khaliq Haqqani and Maulana Saddiq Noor to known anti-coaltion militants Abdullah Masood, Zakeem Khan, former Afghan Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Siraj Haqqani. Abdul Khaliq heads the Darul Uloom Fareeda Gulshan-Ilm madrassa in Miram Shah, the target of a March 7 raid. ISPR Spokesperson Shaukat Sultan called Maulana Sadiq Noor a "key Al Qaida facilitator"  ISLAMABAD 00003895  002.2 OF 002   and placed him on the military's "most wanted" list in November 2005. Some reports indicate that he was targetted during the September 14 raid on the Haqqani Madrassa in Mir Ali because of his communications with Abdullah Masood; he continued to elude capture during a subsequent November 2005 negotiation with the Utmanzai Wazir tribe  Musharraf Blames Afghanistan ---------------------------- 6. (C) Some press reports indicate that some of the militants killed were Afghan. President Musharraf and Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao were quick to point fingers via the press at Afghanistan for the continued militant "incursion" across the porous Afghan-Pakistan border. As part of a continuing offensive on Afghanistan over the past few days, Prime Minister Aziz yesterday suggested to reporters that Afghanistan's inability to control its borders is destabilizing the FATA and told reporters critical of the military operations in the region that the sustained military action in Waziristan was necessitated by armed militants entering Pakistani territory.  Comment ------- 7. (C) If the casualty estimates are accurate, then this series of engagements is one of the most serious since Pakistani military forces first entered Waziristan.  In the Embassy's judgement, the Pakistan Military's strikes on March 1-2 stirred up a hornet's nest that the military was underprepared for. Though the situation has calmed in the last two days, it is too soon to assess the medium and long term effects. End comment. CROCKER

S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 004373  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  JCS: PLEASE PASS TO GENERAL PACE  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/2016 TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, PK, PREL, PTER, KTFN SUBJECT: POLITICAL SCENESETTER FOR GENERAL PACE  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1. (S) The U.S. Mission in Pakistan warmly welcomes your planned March 20 - 22 visit to Pakistan.  As demonstrated during President Bush's recent visit to Islamabad, both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz are western-oriented modernizers who are trying to move Pakistan toward enlightened moderation.  They view the President's visit as a landmark in the relationship and were gratified that he decided stay overnight in Pakistan.  Energy Secretary Bodeman's March 13 follow up visit addressing  SIPDIS Pakistan's concerns about energy was also helpful.  Your visit comes as Pakistan's leaders are working to contain the fallout from the Danish cartoon controversy, while simultaneously suppressing violent separatists in Balochistan, combatting al-Qa'ida and extremists in the Tribal Areas along the Afghan border and guiding earthquake recovery operations.  The government remains fully engaged in earthquake recovery operations, with attention turning from emergency relief toward long-term reconstruction.  We are optimistic that robust USG participation in the earthquake relief effort will promote more positive public opinion toward the United States and help us advance key U.S. objectives, including democratization, regional stability and progress in the global war on terror.  Our mission in Pakistan remains a critical high-threat post, as demonstrated by the March 2 bombing at the U.S. Consulate in Karachi that killed two staff members.  The Cartoon Controversy -----------------------  2. (C) Since mid-February, tens of thousands of Pakistani demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest the publication of the Danish cartoons.  Rallies in Lahore and Peshawar have been particularly destructive, with rampant looting and vandalism in parts of downtown Lahore and Peshawar and six protesters killed.  Although more demonstrations throughout Pakistan followed (including a widely-observed nationwide strike on the day of President Bush's arrival), enhanced security measures by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has prevented any repetition of the unrestrained violence of last month.  Over time, the protests have taken on a greater political tone.  The outrage against the Danes and the EU still festers, but opportunistic politicians have subverted public sentiment in order to condemn the West as a whole (including the U.S.) and to embarrass the Musharraf government.  4.  (C) Following President Bush's lead, your visit presents an opportunity to remind the Pakistani people that the United States understands the sentiments of the Muslim community and that, while we strongly support freedom of expression, we also believe the press should behave responsibly.  More broadly, it will be an opportunity to underscore our desire for warm relations with the Muslim world and a sustained partnership with Pakistan as it addresses the long-term challenges of development and the immediate challenge of earthquake recovery.  Earthquake Relief -----------------  5. (U) The October 8 earthquake (7.6 on the Richter scale) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was the strongest to hit the region in over a century.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) estimates that more than 73,000 individuals died in the quake, with more than 69,000 wounded and some 2.8 million survivors left homeless.  The United States has been Pakistan's most visible international partner in delivering emergency relief over the last five months.  6.  (U) The U.S. military has been on the ground since October 10.  At the peak of initial relief efforts, more than 1,200 personnel and 24 helicopters provided vital transport, logistics and medical and engineering support in affected areas.  As the emergency relief phase is coming to an end, we have closed the two U.S. military hospitals, turning over much of the medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts.  Our Seabee unit has also departed Muzaffarabad, leaving behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineering units.  U.S. airlift operations will be phased out in late March.  7.  (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services in camps and villages.  USAID has provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to help the affected population make it through the harsh Himalayan winter.  USAID recently made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15 million to rebuild schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged $510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately $24 million.  8.  (C) Our prompt and generous response is shifting Pakistani attitudes about the United States, qualitatively improving bilateral relations and sustaining the relationship  during popular unrest.  The hand-in-glove cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army.  As we have drawn down our military presence, we have emphasized that our transition is in parallel with the shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort.  Pakistanis, who have long been convinced that we are fair-weather friends, are beginning to understand that we are interested in a long-term relationship.  Democratization ---------------  9.  (C) President Musharraf has committed - publicly and privately - to move Pakistan toward a civilian-led democracy by the next national elections, which must be held by 2007. U.S. visitors should remind their Pakistani interlocutors (particularly those in the military) of the importance our elected leaders - including President Bush and members of Congress - attach to this transition.  The government must address significant organizational issues before the 2007 national elections, not least of which is an empowered and well-trained election commission.  As a first step, we have urged President Musharraf to appoint a permanent, independent Chief Election Commissioner who is acceptable to all mainstream parties.  When engaging Pakistani contacts, U.S. officials should reinforce the need for civilian control of the military and for the military's full and permanent disengagement from electoral politics.  At the operational level, USAID supports democratization efforts with programs to promote institutional development of the courts, the legislatures, and the political parties.  Afghanistan -----------  10.  (S) The roller-coaster relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan remains susceptible to suspicions and recriminations on both sides, with Afghans concerned about cross-border infiltration and Pakistan worried that India is using assets in Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan. President Musharraf, his government and military leaders recognize that Pakistan must support the Karzai government as it attempts to solidify its control over the country.  To that end, the Government is committed to cooperating on operational security matters with the Afghan government and coalition forces through regular Tripartite Commission meetings.  Over the longer term, President Bush's announcement of Reconstruction Opportunity Zone trade benefits could help boost employment opportunities on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.  11.  (S) The uptick in Pakistani military-militant clashes in North and South Waziristan, which began in December 2005 and surged in early March 2006 in North Waziristan, underscores Pakistan's difficulty in curbing insurgent activity.  Despite a stated commitment by GOP and Pakistani military officials, limited resources, rugged terrain, and uneven capability and support within the Pakistani military, Frontier Corps, and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) limit Pakistan's ability to deliver quick results. We acknowledge the significant progress Pakistan has made in countering terrorist elements since September 2001, but we continue to press the GOP to move forcefully against al-Qa'ida, and more recently, the Taliban and other anti-Coalition militants (ACMs).  India and Kashmir -----------------  12.   (S) President Musharraf and his senior advisors have consistently told us that they have made a strategic decision to end the militancy and even Indian officials acknowledge that the level of violence and cross-border infiltration has declined (though Delhi attributes this to Indian security measures).  President Musharraf believes the GOP's ability to control Kashmiri militants will be greatly enhanced if there is measurable progress with India on Kashmir.  He has specifically pushed for a withdrawal of Indian forces from key population centers in Indian-administered Kashmir (a demand viewed with great skepticism in Delhi).  Musharraf has privately signaled flexibility on final status, but in public remains steadfast in rejecting the Line of Control (LOC) as a permanent international boundary.  While there has been little progress on these core issues relating to Kashmir, senior Indian and Pakistani officials meet regularly through the Composite Dialogue process, which has produced some confidence-building measures, including a pre-notification agreement for ballistic missile launches and the opening of five bus routes between the two countries.  13.  (C) Responding to widespread public opinion, the two governments agreed to open five new LOC crossing points and to permit cross-LOC cell phone service following the October 8 earthquake, to allow divided Kashmiri families the opportunity to comfort one another. These limited measures are changing the dynamic in Kashmir and may accelerate internal pressure on Islamabad and Delhi to create additional space for interaction between Kashmiris in India and Pakistan.  14.  (S) India has long resisted the involvement of third parties in settling the Kashmir issue, and Pakistani leaders understand that any move toward a direct mediating role by the U.S. would be counterproductive.  President Musharraf was pleased by President Bush's even-handed statements about the need for good relations between India and Pakistan and for a peaceful and mutually agreeable solution in Kashmir.  Global War on Terrorism -----------------------  15.  (S) Pakistan deserves commendation for standing with us in the global war on terror, including its efforts against al-Qa'ida and its forceful -- though so far unsuccessful -- efforts to deny safe haven to extremist elements in Pakistan's untamed Tribal Areas along the Afghan border. Following the GOP's decision to extend central government control into the Tribal Areas (historically a "no go" region for the GOP), we have regularly encouraged Pakistani security forces to stay the course in the face of armed resistance. The Pakistan military has suffered over 1,000 casualties in the Tribal areas, with particularly heavy fighting during the days surrounding President Bush's visit.  In recent months, the security situation, especially in Waziristan, has deteriorated, forcing the GOP to rethink its strategy. Musharraf has articulated a three-pronged approach comprising political initiatives, economic development and military operations that are faster, leaner and more targeted than in the past.  We have offered to assist Pakistan's economic development efforts in the Tribal Areas and to provide the Pakistani military training on rapid strike capabilities as it realigns its military tactics.  16.  (C) In the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings, President Musharraf cracked down on terrorist/extremist organizations in Pakistan to much public fanfare.  We have reserved judgment on whether the President has the will to hold the line against Pakistan's extremist elements for the long run.  Initial law enforcement actions targeted the usual suspects -- conservative clerics and Islamist politicians -- prompting a strong popular backlash, with conservatives decrying the focus on Islamists.  Ultimately, the government released most detainees and watered down regulations intended to shine light on madrassa operations.  We have repeatedly pressed senior GOP officials to act decisively against the operational leaders of key terrorist and extremist groups. We have also encouraged GOP officials to take action against madrassas that support, recruit for, or shelter these organizations.  Balochistan -----------  17.  (S) Pakistani leaders are also struggling to cope with an insurgency in the resource-rich province of Balochistan, as local Baloch tribesmen seek to redress historic grievances against Pakistan and seize a greater share of their provincial patrimony.  President Musharraf has swung back and forth between civilian advisors who are counseling caution and a negotiated settlement that addresses Baloch concerns, and military advisors who view the insurgency as an Indian-sponsored threat to national unity to be suppressed. To date, the pendulum appears to have swung toward the military option. This has clear implications for the military's ability to pursue shared U.S.-Pakistan objectives in the Tribal Areas and in the war on terror.  The Pakistani military is already overstretched along its western borders, in North and South Waziristan, in earthquake relief and in managing domestic unrest over the cartoons.  Moreover an escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year.  CROCKER

Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d  1.  (C) Summary: A three-day gathering of Kashmiris, Pakistanis and Indians in Islamabad highlighted the continuing effort of President Musharraf to build support for his peace proposals.  The meeting featured a two-and-a-half hour exchange with Musharraf on his ideas for demilitarization, self-government and joint management. Separately, Musharraf met with pro-Indian Kashmiri politician (and member of Parliament) Omar Abdullah, who by all accounts was favorably impressed with Musharraf's flexibility and commitment to peace.  On the negative side, the Kashmiris fought bitterly among themselves, with some (including the JKLF's Yasin Malik) stressing the need to include the militants in any peace dialogue.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Kashmiris from both sides of the Line of Control (and the diaspora), representing a range of political positions gathered in Islamabad with Pakistani and Indian politicians and academics for a March 10-12 conference that highlighted the changing dynamics of the Kashmir issue and the deep divisions among Kashmiri groups.  The conference was organized by Pugwash, an international organization based in Washington, London, Geneva and Rome, that focuses on security and conflict resolution.  Kashmiri leaders included Omar Abdullah (National Conference), Yasin Malik (JKLF), Sajjad Ghani Lone (People's Conference), Mehbooba Mufti (Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party), Sardar Qayyum (Muslim Conference) and Abdul Ghani Bhatt (Muslim Conference -- Indian Kashmir).  The three days of meetings proceeded under the rotating chairmanship of Pakistani General (ret.) Talaat Masood (a respected policy analyst and Embassy contact), his Indian counterpart and Pugwash Secretary General Paolo Cotta-Ramusino.  Two leaders who were notably absent were Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (APHC) and Syed Ali Geelani.  The Mirwaiz's public explanation for his absence was an injury to his ankle, though our colleagues in the diplomatic community suspect that having boycotted an earlier Indian roundtable, the Mirwaiz felt he should boycott this event too.  3.  (C) On the eve of the conference, PolCouns met with Yasin Malik and several Pakistan-based JKLF leaders.  Malik downplayed the significance of the conference, predicting that meetings on the margins would be more important than the session itself.  He repeatedly stressed the need to include Kashmiri militant groups in the peace process, saying that he had made the same point to Manmohan Singh.  He said he had told Singh that outside of Jammu, India and its supporters (i.e., Omar Abdullah) had "zero support" in Kashmir, and that for any peace initiative to succeed it would have to draw in militants.  He had made the same point directly to moderates like Abdullah who, in his view, were in danger of being seen as Indian appeasers and of losing support in Kashmir.  4.  (C) President Musharraf spent two and half hours with the group on the opening day, explaining his proposals for demilitarization, self-governance and joint management of Kashmir.  The objective, he said was to find a solution that would not involve redrawing borders or making the Line of Control (LoC) permanent, but to instead make the LoC irrelevant.  He stressed that these were simply ideas, and that Pakistan would welcome Indian input but that time was of the essence.  Leaders on both sides needed to seize the "fleeting opportunity" for peace.  5.  (C) Musharraf also held a separate 45-minute one-on-one with Omar Abdullah, whose visit represented the first trip to Pakistan in recent memory by a leading pro-Indian Kashmiri leader.  According to press reports (including The Hindu), Abdullah emerged from the meeting impressed that "Musharraf has shown greater flexibility than Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."  He remarked that Musharraf was "the best bet for India to do business with," as he had "shifted from the traditional maximalist position on Kashmir and shown flexibility."  6.  (C) Talaat Masood told PolCouns that the actual proceedings of the conference were less important than the opportunity it provided for discussions that would never have happened otherwise. For the first time people who had avoided each other were sitting at the same table.  Masood credited the Indian leadership for allowing broad participation.  ISLAMABAD 00004386  002 OF 002   Secondly, according to Masood, the conference had highlighted that "the age of favorites is over" as evidenced by the fact that Pakistan and India had been talking to a range of Kashmiri leaders.  Masood noted that Pugwash had been talking to Kashmiri militant groups, including Hizbul-Mujahedin (but not "dangerous groups" like Lashkar e-Tayyiba), and that they too were interested in dialogue.  Thirdly, Masood thought it was significant that a number of Indian officials who participated had come away impressed with both Musharraf and Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri, who had hosted a reception on the opening night.  7.  (C) Masood observed that the conference had highlighted a significant challenge, namely the divisions among the militant groups.  He reported that during one session, the Kashmiris from the diaspora and from both sides of the LoC had been sent into a room to deliberate on possible solutions to the Kashmir conflict, while the Pakistani and Indian delegates were sent into a second room with the same instructions.  The latter group came to agreement on some recommendations, while the Kashmiris "could not agree on anything."  In part, Masood blamed diaspora Kashmiris, who had created "an industry" out of the Kashmir conflict. However, the Kashmiri "rightists" were also unhelpful because of "insecurities" as they were caught between militant groups on the one hand and an evolving peace effort on the other. As a prominent case in point, he remarked that Yasin Malik was trying to be a champion of the militants, but that militant groups were shunning him out of concern that he was too accommodating on Musharraf's agenda.  Masood held Malik largely responsible for blocking the proposed concluding statement of the conference, which would have stated that "violence in all its forms should cease forthwith."  (One press report recounts a shouting match on the steps of the Foreign Ministry among Kashmiri participants and members of the Pakistani press corps.)  8.  (C) Masood was also concerned that, as he saw it, Musharraf's advisors in the military and intelligence services were "out of sync" with the President himself. Musharraf was much more forward-leaning and flexible than some of his supporters.  Masood considered the Foreign Ministry to be an exception, however, assessing Kasuri's performance with the delegates as "brilliant."  Comment -------  9.  (C) This was the third visit to Pakistan of leading Kashmiris over the past year, following a visit by an APHC delegation last June (that included the Mirwaiz) and a visit by Yasin Malik and others after the October earthquake. The conference nonetheless represented a milestone in that it saw the joint participation of an unprecedented range of Kashmiri groups and included a meeting between Musharraf and a pro-Indian Kashmiri politician.  The event also marked a continuation of Musharraf's effort to broaden the constituency in India and Kashmir for his "out of the box" ideas.  The anti-conference stance of militant groups, as reported in the press, is also a backhanded indication of its significance.  Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen Commander "General" Abdullah called the conference a "sellout" and accused Musharraf of seeking to foist Omar Abdullah on the Kashmiri people.  The commander of Al Umar Mujahideen charged Musharraf with damaging the Pakistani cause at American behest and characterized Pugwash as "an attempt to put Kashmir on the back-burner."    CROCKER

(C) Summary:  Post has designed an electoral support strategy in order to promote free and fair elections national and provincial elections in 2007.  In order to implement fully the various aspects of this strategy, we will require dedicated funding support from DRL to complement our USAID DG and PAS funding, which will support other aspects of the electoral support program.  For funding to be effective, we will need to begin now to solicit specific election-related proposals with the intention of seeing implementation as early as June 2006.  Post requests that DRL make funds available and solicit proposals for the following projects discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs:  International Election Observation including Parallel Vote Count Development of an Election Code of Conduct Voter Education Activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas Training of Police Forces on Election Security  End Summary  Election Observation:  Estimated Cost $10-20 million  2. (C) Opposition political parties and the general public understandably have a low-level of confidence in election processes in Pakistan.  Fraud and rigging of elections, up to and including the 2005 local bodies contest, have occurred with great regularity in the nomination, campaign, voting, and counting phases.  Post believes, therefore, that it will be imperative to ensure that international observation covers all of these phases in an effort to provide both international validation of the contest and increased confidence in the results.  Given the persistent allegations of rigging during the counting process, a parallel vote count needs to be included as part of the observation.  Post has discussed the need for international observation with other donors.  While there is uniform agreement on the need for such a mission, there is, as yet, no readiness on the part of other local missions to commit to funding.  As it will take significant time for any implementing partner to organize the observation and parallel vote count, we strongly recommend that DRL move immediately to conduct a limited solicitation by invitation (NDI, IRI, IFES, Carter Center, etc.) and award a grant to enable an international NGO to begin this process.  We will look to DRL to determine the necessary funding level and to coordinate with other donor nations on their contributions to this process.  Election Code of Conduct: Estimated Cost $500,000  3. (C) Developing an electoral code of conduct that is agreeable to all parties will be essential during the 2007 election process.  In the past, the code has been imposed on parties by the Election Commission with no consultation and had significant loopholes that have been routinely exploited by the ruling party.  For this reason, post believes that international technical assistance will be necessary (1) to ensure that the code adequately prevents any behavior that could unduly prejudice the outcome of the election and (2) to facilitate negotiations among the parties and with the Election Commission.  PAS is willing to use its Speaker's Program to fund travel and support of one or more international experts for this process.  Additional support from DRL will allow for the participation of additional experts including from the region.  Development of an Electoral Code of Conduct will need to take place in December 2006/January 2007 in order to meet the likely election timeframe of late 2007.  Funding for this activity can occur from FY 07 funds, but the solicitation and award process will need to take place in October for this to occur.  Voter Education: Estimated Cost $1 million  4. (C) Political transformation of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is a high-priority USG objective.  The 2007 National Assembly elections are a key opportunity to begin this transformation and to expand the franchise beyond the small number who traditionally vote from this region. Post believes that additional voter education/"get out the vote campaigns" particularly targeting women are an essential component of holding a credible election in this area in 2007.  We look to DRL to finance such education through a grant to an international NGO through a limited selection process.  NGOs would need to be strongly encouraged to utilize established local partners as a key component of their program given the difficulties of working in the FATA.  ISLAMABAD 00004595  002 OF 002    Training of Police: Estimated Cost $250,000  5. (S/NF) In advance of the 2005 local bodies elections, post successfully engaged with the GOP to prevent the involvement of intelligence agencies in the electoral process.  With this channel of manipulation closed, provincial and district governments turned to the local police to intimidate, harass, and manipulate candidates and voters.  We believe that training of District Police Officers on the appropriate methodology for providing security during an election can help to inculcate a sense of professionalism within the force, thereby limiting abuses.  In addition, given the violent nature of Pakistani polls, professional training may well help to increase security.  Post already has an active police training program run through DOJ's ICITAP.  We recommend for this reason that DRL transfer necessary funds to ICITAP to carry out this additional specialized training approximately two months in advance of the election date.  Comment  6. (C) Post appreciates DRL's consideration and prompt funding of these proposals.  We believe that these discreet programs will play a crucial role in ensuring free and fair elections in Pakistan and will build on USAID and PAS work in complementary areas. CROCKER

(U) This is an action request.  See para. 5  2. (C) Senator Asfandyar Wali Khan, Chairman of the secular Pashtun-nationalist Awami National Party (ANP) called on Ambassador on March 17 to discuss his recent meeting with President Musharraf (septel).  According to Asfandyar, the ANP has taken a strategic decision to support the GOP's efforts against extremist and Islamist elements operating in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).  As historically the strongest rival to the Islamists in these regions, ANP cooperation with the government is critical to combating successfully terrorist and extremist elements in these regions and to advancing the government's overall strategy of political, economic, and social transformation.  3. (C) Asfandyar's decision to cooperate with the GOP marks a significant change in ANP tactics that carry with it potential risks in breaking from the united anti-Musharraf opposition platform.  We believe that those in the ANP who wish to challenge Asfandyar's leadership, such as his stepmother Begum Nasim Wali Khan, may attempt to exploit Asfandyar's overtures to divide the party.  Such leaders do not/not share Asfandyar's willingness to work with the United States and the GOP on our efforts to combat extremism/terrorism.  For this reason, we believe that immediate overtures showing strong support for Asfandyar, as a result of his decision to cooperate with Musharraf, are essential.  Senior-level meetings in Washington will help to reassure his constituents that he is in a position to advocate effectively on their behalf and will offer us an opportunity to exchange views and strategies with a like-minded Pashtun leader.  4. (U) Senator Asfandyar Wali Khan will be visiting Washington from April 3-13.  We recommend in keeping with our general practice for Pakistani opposition leaders, including former PM Bhutto, that meetings be arranged at the Deputy Assistant Secretary or Office Director level. Based on Asfandyar's requests, post recommends meetings with the following USG offices/individuals:  -- National Security Council, Senior Director for South Asia -- Office of the Vice President -- Central Intelligence Agency -- National Counterterrorism Center -- Department of State, Bureau of South Asian Affairs, Deputy Assistant Secretary -- Department of State, Director of Policy Planning -- Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Deputy Assistant Secretary -- U.S. Agency for International Development, Bureau of Asia and the Near East, Deputy Assistant Administrator -- Department of Defense, International Security Affairs, Near East and South Asian Affairs -- Department of Transportation, Office of International Transportation and Trade -- Department of Energy, Office of Policy and International Affairs  In addition, Asfandyar has requested assistance in organizing meetings with the Rand Corporation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  5.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  During a March 17 conversation with PM - A/S Hillen, Pakistan's Vice Chief of Army Staff GEN Ahsan Saleem Hyat said that he would welcome the expanding a joint exercise between the U.S. and Pakistan military schedule for later this spring to include a unit from the Afghan National Army (ANA).  The exercise in question -- Inspired Gambit -- is scheduled for May 2 - 10, with a training location at Tarbela and exercise site at Cherat, NWFP. The exercise will focus on preparation of air assault operations at a battalion level and execution at a company level.  GEN Ahsan believed that including an ANA unit (perhaps one ANA squadron attached to each participating U.S. and Pakistani unit) would increase interoperability and cross-border cooperation, as well as help to cool the heated public rhetoric that has characterized the Pakistani-Afghan bilateral relationship over the past month.  2.  (C)  GEN Hyat first raised the prospect of ANA forces joining the Inspired Gambit exercise during his March 6 meeting in Islamabad with GEN Abizaid.  His fulsome discussion of the proposal in his meeting with A/S Hillen reveal that he has given the idea serious consideration in the interim.  Emb Islamabad supports GEN Hyat's suggestion, agreeing that folding an ANA unit into this exercise offers an early opportunity to advance cross-border cooperation and build trust between these neighbors.  3.  (C)  Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) officers raised the possibility of ANA participation in a March 20 Inspired Gambit planning meeting with the Pakistan Army's Directorate General-Military Training (DGMT); DGMT representatives were receptive, although surprised to hear that the idea originated with GEN Ahsan.  The Pakistani side said that -- for cultural, dietary and language reasons -- they would look into providing mess and billets for the ANA contingent, while the ODRP representative would take on responsibility for transporting the ANA troops to/from Afghanistan.  4.  (C)  Comment:  As we work to increase positive interaction between Pakistn and Afghanistan, this is a positive development.  We hope that Embassy Kabul and CFC-A will encourage Afghan participation in this exercise.  5.  (U)  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. CROCKER

(S) Summary:  In recent separate meetings, Awami National Party (ANP) Chairman Senator Asfandyar Wali Khan and Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) Chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim delivered closely coordinated messages to the Embassy. Both leaders were prepared to support an alliance of "liberal" forces under Musharraf, as their parties and the ruling party would face a common enemy in the 2007 elections -- the Islamists.  If this were not possible, the parties would accept a post-electoral alliance.  The ANP and PPPP were prepared to cooperate with the GOP on the Global War on Terrorism and its concept of "enlightened moderation." Asfandyar, however, made several suggestions to improve GOP performance in this area, including: transfer of intelligence personnel previously involved in supporting the Taliban, increased emphasis on economic/social development and political reform in FATA, and closer coordination between liberal parties and the GOP in pursuit of extremist/terrorist elements.  End Summary.  Awami National Party --------------------  2. (C) In a March 17 meeting with the Ambassador, ANP Chairman Senator Asfandyar Wali Khan stated that following extensive discussions the ANP had finally arrived at a common understanding with the GOP.  Asfandyar's call followed immediately from his first meeting with President Musharraf since the 2002 elections.  According to Asfandyar, the two leaders agreed that they shared a common vision to promote a moderate, democratic Pakistan and a common goal of defeating terrorist and extremist elements.  Asfandyar promised his party's cooperation in the GOP's efforts to track and apprehend terrorists in FATA and NWFP and agreed to share any information that his party developed on their whereabouts. Asfandyar sought an electoral understanding for 2007 with the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and other like-minded parties, including the PPPP, in which they would support common candidates in order to minimize the success of Islamist parties.  Asfandyar indicated that Musharraf was receptive but non-commital.  Asfandyar made clear that, absent such an agreement, his party would still offer its support to GOP counterterrorism efforts and would participate in a post-election coalition government.  Asfandyar seemed relatively convinced that the ANP would be given a fair chance during the 2007 elections following his discussions with Musharraf.  3. (S) While Asfandyar termed his meeting with Musharraf "positive," he shared a number of concerns about the GOP's counterterrorism efforts.  Asfandyar maintained that, although the leadership of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) was committed to tracking and apprehending al-Qaida and former Taliban, its on-the-ground operatives were not.  Many had previously supported these elements and had personal connections that have led them to defy Musharraf's policy.  To overcome this problem, Asfandyar recommended the immediate transfer of all ISI agents from FATA that had previously worked with the Taliban and mujahideen.  Asfandyar argued that increased emphasis needed to be placed on social and economic development in the FATA as a complement to military/law enforcement efforts.  He praised the new GOP development plan and stated that he was providing Musharraf a copy of his party's own plan so that the two could be merged. Asfandyar asserted that political reform was necessary in the FATA.  Immediate progress could be made in all agencies, save North and South Waziristan, where extremists groups had a stranglehold on local politics.  As a first step, administration should be shifted from the federal to the NWFP provincial government, thereby building political ties between the agencies and the NWFP.  Asfandyar  ISLAMABAD 00004767  002.2 OF 002   claimed to have pressed Musharraf for closer cooperation with his party as it pursued terrorists in the FATA.  He cited several cases in which local leaders from the ANP had been erroneously arrested and interrogated for alleged links to extremists.  Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians  5. (C) In a separate meeting the same evening with poloff, PPPP Chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim raised many of the same points, including the need for an electoral understanding with ANP and PML and the PPPP's willingness to participate in a coalition government.  Fahim again pressed for a resumption of serious negotiations between the PPPP and the government, lamenting the fact that his party had not been included in the ANP meetings.  According to Fahim, the PPPP is willing to negotiate all issues, including the future status of Benazir Bhutto, in pursuit of a common pre-election understanding and would not/not insist on her candidacy in the 2007 National Assembly elections.  He also expressed a strong desire to move quickly to bring together leaders of all parties to negotiate and implement changes in the election law.  Fahim stressed that the recent meeting between Bhutto and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Shahbaz Sharif in Dubai was "meaningless."  The PPPP wants to keep its alliance with the PML-N only long enough to recapture the opposition leader job in the Senate for Raza Rabbani.  After that, the PML-N can be easily abandoned.  Fahim emphasized that most of those remaining in the PML-N were neither democrats nor liberals, making the PML-N's participation in any common understanding problematic.  Comment  6. (C) Post believes that the ANP and the PPPP had coordinated their messages and are serious about their shared desire to build a pre-election coalition of like-minded moderate parties, including the PML.  Both recognize that a united opposition which includes the Islamists is contrary to their political goals and will ultimately weaken their parties.  With Fahim's statement that the PPPP is prepared to consider a non-elected role for Bhutto (at least until the National Assembly elections are over), the "like-minded coalition" may well be achievable.  The ANP's decision to cooperate actively with the GOP in counterterrorist operations in FATA and NWFP is important.  Its on-the-ground presence in these areas can help both to spur residents to increased cooperation and extend the government's information network in these critical areas.  7.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S)  Summary:  On March 24, MFA Director Tasneem Aslam advised DCM that the GOP seeks "hard evidence" from the USG that could be used in domestic legal proceedings on the implemenation of terror financing sanctions against organizations designated by the UN 1267 Committee.  Aslam claimed that the GOP has no/no information linking three organizations to terror activity or financing, and that it feared that it would be required by domestic courts to seek the organizations' delisting if it could not conclusively demonstrate that these organizations have engaged or supported terrorist activity.  Aslam also asked that the U.S. identify the specific members -- "the worst cases" -- in these organzations, so that terror financing links could be severed by targeted criminal prosecution of those individuals directly involved, rather than by sanctions applied to institutions widely regarded as legitimate charities by the Pakistan public.  End summary.  2.  (S)  On March 24, MFA Director General (UN and Policy Planing Directorate) Tasneem Aslam asked to meet Deputy Chief of Mission Peter W. Bodde to discuss the GOP's implementation of terror finance sanctions against organizations and individuals designated by the UN 1267 Committee.  Assuring the DCM that the GOP "persistently applies" all 1267 sanctions, Aslam said that the government has particular concerns regarding three organizations:  Al Rashid Trust, Al Akhtar Trust and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD).  (Note:  Although Aslam referred several times to Jamaat-ud-Dawa as a 1267 Committee designee, she later corrected herself and noted that she was speaking in anticipation of a USG request in early April to amend the current Lashkar-e-Tayyba designation to include its charitable wing, JuD. End note.)  Aslam raised two key issues:  --  A request that the U.S. provide the GOP "hard evidence" that the GOP could use in domestic legal proceedings to defend its implementation of terror finance sanctions following a 1267 Committee designation; and  -- A request that the U.S. identify specific individuals in these three organizations -- particularly JuD -- that it believes to be connected to terrorist activity, so that actions could be brought against these individuals rather than against the whole organization.   3.  (S)  Aslam explained the GOP request by citing the current case before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in which the GOP appealed a Sindh High Court decision ordering the release of Al Rashid Trust funds that the GOP had frozen following the 1267 Committee designation.  Aslam said that the GOP expects Al Akhtar Trust and JuD to eventually file similar court cases, which will shift the burden of proof of the organizations complicity with terrorist financing to the GOP.  If the GOP loses the Al Rashid Trust and other future cases, it will have no choice but to formally request that the 1267 Committee de-list the designee.  4.  (S)  The GOP faces not only this legal burden, Aslam continued; the earthquake relief work done by JuD and Al Rashid Trust has earned them high public esteem.  The GOP would be hard pressed to explain to the Pakistani people why it has imposed sanctions on these organizations unless it can publicly articulate the organizations' offenses...and back up its claims with verifiable evidence.  The GOP has kept a tight rein on these militant organizations providing relief in the earthquake zone, preventing them from engaging in any fund-raising activity  5.  (S)  According to Aslam, the GOP received no/no information on the terror finance connections of Al Rashid Trust and Al Akhtar Trust at the time of their designation by the 1267 Committee, and it presently has no/no information linking either these two groups or JuD to terrorist activity.  (Note:  In addition to pressing Aslam on this assertion during the meeting, the DCM raised the issue again in a follow-up telephone call.  Aslam remained firm that the GOP has no information tieing these three organizations to terrorist activity.  End note.)  6.  (S)  Aslam then approached the designation issue from a different angle, beginning with an overview of the GOP's policy goal of persuading militant organizations to abandon the use of violence, followed by a program to "reintegrate" former militants back into society, as the GOP has done with detainees released from Guantanamo Bay.    This effort is not well served by imposing terror financing sanctions on popular militant organizations (e.g., JuD), which are seen as serving  ISLAMABAD 00005070  002 OF 003   local communities.  Aslam requested that the U.S. identify to the GOP those individuals in JuD against whom it has evidence of terrorist connections and then share that evidence with the GOP for use in appropriate criminal proceedings.  7.  (S) Throughout Aslam's presentation, DCM and poloff pressed for clarification of whether the GOP would continue to implement and enforce 1267 Committee sanctions, per Pakistan's international obligations.  Aslam replied that the GOP must abide by the decisions of its domestic courts.  When asked whether the GOP believed that a militant organization's participation in earthquake relief activities obviated terror finance offenses, Aslam replied that the GOP's present concern is one of due process for the designees:  these organizations will use the legal protections available under Pakistani law to demand that the GOP defend it's implementation of terror finance sanctions.  If the GOP cannot do that, the designees will have won both a judicial victory and the fight for public opinion.  DCM telephoned Aslam after the meeting to underscore the U.S. position that Pakistan has an international obligation to implement and enforce all 1267 Committee sanctions against designated organizations, that the USG views these organizations as having taken advantage of the GOP's willingness to allow them to participate in earthquake relief operations to bolster their public image, expand their recruitment base and develop new sources of terrorist financing, and that the U.S. strongly urges that the GOP take all necessary action to end relief activities by sanctioned organizations.  8.  (S)  Comment:  Post finds much of Aslam's presentation dubious, particularly her denial that the GOP has any information linking JuD (aka LeT, an organization that has been banned domestically in Pakistan since 2002) or the others to terror finance activity.  Post requests that Department advise on the extent to which information on these organizations' terror finance links were/are available to the GOP through the 1267 Committee designation process.  In the interim, Ambassador will raise U.S objections to the substance of Aslam's demarche when he next sees the Foreign Secretary.  SIPDIS   9.  (S)  Text of the non-paper passed during Ms. Aslam's demarche are reproduced below:   (Begin text.)  Pakistan's commitment to fight terrorism, root and branch, needs no elaboration.  We are fulfilling all our international obligations flowing from UNSC resolutions which recommend specific measures against Taliban and Al Qaida organizations particularly resolution 1267 and subsequent resolutions to mprove the sanctions regime.  The sanctions are imposed in accordance with domestic laws as the relevant resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter (Ref.SC Act of 1948).  This, however, does not end the political and legal predicament the Government has to face while explaining the rationale behind imposing sanctions to domestic audience at least against some of the organizations such as Al Rashid Trust.  Legal:  because, in the absence of incontrovertible evidence, some people view sanctions as an attempt to give ascendency to executive over judiciary.  Political:  because, again unless proof is provided to public, they view sanctions as unjustified because of the participation of certain organizations such as Al Rashid and Jamat ud Dawa in good charity work.  The case of Al Rashid Trust is pending in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.  As the Government had appealed against the decision of the Sindh High Court to release the funds of the Trust, it would, in addition to certain other domestic legislations (UNSC Act 1948), need hard evidence against the Al Rashid Trust to plead its case.  Use of UNSC Act alone may fulfill immediate legal requirement but seeking decision only on its basis may create legal and political complications mentioned earlier.  We would, therefore, require credible evidence against Al Rashid Trust, Al Akhtar Trust and Jamat-ud-Dawa for more  ISLAMABAD 00005070  003 OF 003   effective actions against them.  I would also like to explore the possibility of isolating, and, punishing only those criminal individuals (if they could be identified with evidence), who are using these organizations for terrorist activities instead of sanctioning whole organizations as per the current procedures of 1267 Committee.  These organizations would be asked to purge themselves of all identified individuals (and sanction would be imposed on them), failing which the whole organization would be sanctioned.  This would help us deal with political implications of the sanctions by maintaining transparency in the process.  (End text.) CROCKER 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ISLAMABAD 005123  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2015 TAGS: PK, PTER, MOPS, MASS, MCAP, PREL SUBJECT: A/S HILLEN VISIT TO PAKISTAN  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1. (C) Introduction:  On his March 15-18 visit to Pakistan, A/S John Hillen and PM/RSAT Tom Canahuate met with senior Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials, as well as Pakistan's top military leadership.  Describing his role in soliciting support for USG security assistance to Pakistan from the U.S. Congress, A/S Hillen urged Pakistan's defense leaders to come to a decision soonest on the desired configuration for its purchase of F-16s.  A/S Hillen described the process by which the Administration notifies Congress of the transfer of defense assets, and counseled the Pakistanis on steps they could take to facilitate Congressional approval of the F-16 transfer.  Turning to the Global War on Terror (GWOT), A/S Hillen praised Pakistan's commitment to routing anti-Coalition militants and other extremists in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Pak-Afghan border, and sought Pakistani perspectives on how the U.S. could best configure its security assistance to support Pakistan's security operations in the region.  Many Pakistani interlocutors raised questions regarding the expanding bilateral relationship between the U.S. and India, noting that it has led to much public speculation as to the value that Washington ascribes to the U.S.-Pakistan relationship.  A/S Hillen stated flatly that President Bush does not view our bilateral relations with India and with Pakistan as a zero sum game; he stressed that the Administration seeks a sustained, strategic relationship with Pakistan. End introduction.  National Defense College (NDC) ------------------------------  2.  (SBU) At NDC Commandant LTG Raza Muhammed Khan and his staff briefed A/S Hillen on the institution's history, mission and organization.  In a broad discussion of security issues, LTG Raza raised a number of "irritants" in the Pakistani-Afghanistan relationship, citing difficulties in achieving effective security cooperation along the common border and Pakistan's vulnerability vis-a-vis India's "foreign hand," which he alleged is operating out of Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  Raza voiced his concern at the expanding U.S.-Indian relationship, saying that new Delhi received "far more than it deserved" during President Bush's recent visit.  A/S Hillen assured LTG Raza that although India is an important global power with whom the U.S. has a broad and complex relationship, this does not detract from the sustained and enduring partnership that the U.S. and Pakistan have built over decades.  A/S Hillen and LTG Raza agreed that NDC will play a vital role as the U.S. and Pakistan strive for a partnership of strategic vision, not simply military hardware.  Ministry of Defense (MoD) -------------------------  3.  (C)  At the MoD, A/S Hillen was received by Minister of State Zahid Hamid and Additional Secretary RDML (ret.) A.H. Chaudhary.   Hamid thanked the U.S. for its assistance following the October 8 South Asian earthquake.  A/S Hillen turned the conversation to the value of the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, which he would like to expand for Pakistan.  When Hillen asked for an assessment of Government of Pakistan's (GOP) current thinking on F-16 aircraft purchase,  Minister Hamid said that the GOP is definitely interested in purchasing new aircraft, as well as refurbishing its current fleet and perhaps acquiring airframes through third-country buy-backs.  (Note:  Hamid was not specific as to the number of new aircraft the GOP would seek.  End note.)  Hillen encouraged the MoD to forward its desired mix of F-16s to the USG as soon as possible, so that the administration can move forward with Congressional Notification on the transfer.  Minister Hamid was pleased to  ISLAMABAD 00005123  002 OF 004   hear A/S Hillen say that he is trying to increase USG financial support for Pakistani forces currently engaged in security operations in the Tribal Areas along the Afghan border.  Recognizing Pakistan's leading role in international peace-keeping operations, Hillen also encouraged the MoD to consider offering training to African militaries interested in enhancing their conflict prevention and stabilization capacities.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) ---------------------------------  4.  (C) At the MFA, Chief of Protocol (and former Director General - Disarmament) Nazir Hussain briefed A/S Hillen on Pakistan's programs to enhance its non-proliferation regime. The Protocol Chief expressed gratitude to the U.S. for earthquake relief assistance, but also shared deep dismay that President Bush had resurrected the A.Q. Khan legacy by citing Pakistan's non-proliferation record as the reason the U.S. would not consider offering Islamabad a civil nuclear deal to parallel that with India.  "Your man cut Musharraf off at the knees" with that public comment, Hussain said, noting that his President has a tough time selling his close relationship with the U.S. to a deeply skeptical Pakistani public.  (Note:  Nazir Hussain's briefing on a special PM program will be reported septel.  End note).  Additional Secretary (Americas) Shahid Kamal told A/S Hillen that  SIPDIS Pakistan is looking forward to moving forward after the successful visit by President Bush earlier in March.  The public now has high expectations for the bilateral relationship, which presents a challenge to both sides.  When Hillen asked for one area in which Pakistan could use U.S. assistance, Kamal quickly took the opportunity to name two: education and market access for textiles.  Additional Secretary for International Organizations Tariq Usman Haider  SIPDIS asked to see A/S Hillen to discuss the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), asking whether the U.S. would be willing to discuss possible Pakistani PSI participation; A/S Hillen agreed to take the question back to his T-Bureau colleagues in Washington.  Pakistan Air Force Head Quarters --------------------------------  5.  (C) At PAF HQ March 17, Air Vice Marshall (AVM) Khalid Chaudhry (Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Operations) and Air Commodore Jamshed listened carefully as A/S Hillen outlined concerns raised by some Members of Congress regarding the pending sale of F-16s to Pakistan.  AVM Chaudhry assured A/S Hillen that Pakistan is prepared to address all USG security concerns regarding the F-16s. Citing PAF's long history of cooperation with USAF, he was perplexed that some in the U.S. are still anxious about Pakistan's security protocols for the F-16s.  Chaudhry acknowledged that the Chinese JF-17 (another staple in the PAF fleet) is simply not comparable to the F-16 in terms of quality, particularly its avionics and weapons systems. Chaudhry then contrasted PAF's F-16 fleet to the array of fighters possessed by the Indian Air Force (IAF), supported  by strong defense acquisition relationships with the U.S. and Israel.  "The math just doesn't add up," Chaudhry said, admitting that the PAF has no hope of matching the IAF's resources.  Even the proposed F-16 purchase will not make that much difference in the relative imbalance of power, although it will enable Pakistan to maintain a minimum deterrent capability.  The F-16s have acquired a mythic quality in Pakistan, AVM Chaudhry admitted, taking on an inflated symbolic importance in the public imagination.  He concluded by asking A/S Hillen to ensure that the F-16 deal has enough sweeteners to appeal to the public -- a complete squadron of new F-16s, with JDAM and night-vision capability -- but not to offer the PAF things that it cannot afford.  6. (C)  Warming to his subject, Chaudhry told the delegation  ISLAMABAD 00005123  003 OF 004   that Pakistan would certainly establish adequate security protocols for the F-16s, but that at the end of the day, the U.S. simply needs to trust its partner.  He cautioned that the U.S. should not "mock" Pakistan by offering "bone-yard" F-16s as part of the sale, saying that offering to transfer mothballed aircraft only plays into the hand of President Musharraf's extremist enemies, who already find a ready audience amongst Pakistan's uneducated masses.  In contrast, Chaudhry said, the Chinese "understand the Pakistani psyche" and therefore "they offer us everything," always on advantageous financial terms.  7. (S)  Given all that Pakistan has done for the U.S., Chaudhry said, Pakistan's military leaders have a difficult time maintaining positive attitudes toward the U.S. amongst enlisted personnel.  He cited the suseptibility of the enlisted ranks -- most of whom come from rural villages -- to the influence of extremist Islamic clerics:  "You can't imagine what a hard time we have trying to get to trim their beards."  (Note: This last comment refers to the tradition of conservative Muslims to grow full beards as a sign of piety. End note.)  Chaudhry claimed to receive reports monthly of acts of petty sabotage, which he interpreted as an effort by Islamists amongst the enlisted ranks to prevent PAF aircraft from being deployed in support of security operations in the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Afghan border.  (Note:  Speaking off the record, Chaudhry told A/S Hillen that PAF aircraft are regularly called to provide air support to military and security forces when they get into tight spots in the FATA...dryily adding that Army brass and the ground forces commanders would deny it.  End note.)  Vice Chief of Army Staff (VCOAS) --------------------------------  8.  (C) VCOAS GEN Ahdan Saleem Hyat greeted A/S Hillen with thanks for American generosity and steadfast support following the October 8 earthquake, fondly describing how U.S. Chinook helicopters became a symbol of the relief effort.  He offered his condolences on the deaths of two Embassy Karachi employees in a March 2 suicide bombing, before turning to Pak-Afghan relations. Praising the Tripartite Commission, GEN Ahsan opined that increased mil-mil interaction and cooperation -- including exchanges and intelligence-sharing -- would squelch the unhelpful public bickering widely reported in the media in recent weeks. GEN Ahsan renewed a proposal first presented to GEN Abizaid and LTG Eikenberry on March 6 to incorporate Afghan National Army (ANA) troops into a joint Pak-U.S. counter-terrorism (CT) exercise scheduled for May 2006.  GEN Ahsan said that Pakistan must succeed in its current CT operations in the FATA along the Aghan border for its own sake.  Grateful for U.S. assistance thus far, GEN Ahsan said that future assistance must be more sharply focused, particularly citing Pakistan's need for top-of-the-line air assault assets equipped with night-vision capability.  Ahsan gave special emphasis to the need to minimize collateral damage in the FATA, in order not to alienate the local population whose cooperation was critical to identifying and dislodging militant forces seeking refuge in the area.  A/S Hillen responded that the U.S. fully understood the benefits of night operations in support of a counter-insurgency campaign.  He also praised GEN Ahsan's description of the GOP's integrated strategy to extend government control to the FATA, securing military gains with development assistance and political engagement.   Field Trip to Shahbaz and Mushaf Air Bases ------------------------------------------  9.  (C)  On March 16, A/S Hillen led a U.S. delegation to the Shahbaz Air Base near Jacobabad, Sindh Province, for  ISLAMABAD 00005123  004 OF 004   briefings on the Falcon Talon F-16 joint USAF-PAF exercise. After an initial greeting and briefing by Base Commander Air Commodore Athar Bukhari, A/S Hillen and delegation toured the airbase and visited with USAF F-16 ground crew and support staff. The Falcon Talon exercise is the first unified USAF/PAF exercise on Pakistani soil.  The exercises covered daytime air combat intercepts and unified strike missions. Non-flying exercise objectives covered EOD, flight safety and quality assurance.  On March 17, A/S Hillen and delegation traveled to Mushaf Air Base in Sargodha, which has been the home of Pakistan's F-16 fleet since 1983.  The delegation received a thorough briefing of security and maintenance procedures at the base before touring key facilities.  10. (U)  This cable has been cleared by A/S Hillen. CROCKER

Crocker, DSCG 05-01, January 2005, Edition 1, Reason: 1.4 (B,D)   1. (C) Summary.  President Bush's March 3-4 visit to Pakistan inspired a range of opinions on the state of the US-Pakistan relationship.  Government officials, such as President Musharraf, PM Aziz, and FM Kasuri expressed satisfaction with the visit and its outcomes, including the launching of a strategic dialogue and progress on counterterrorism and defense cooperation.  Opposition parties, who are typically critical of US policy, applauded the President,s comments on democracy.  As expected, most criticism centered on a familiar sticking point for Pakistan: India.  President Musharraf and other GOP officials, however, sought to counter the widely held view that what is good for India must be bad for Pakistan.  End Summary.  GOVERNMENT POSITIVE ON US-PAKISTAN RELATIONS... --------------------------------------------- -- 2. (SBU) In public statements and private conversations following President Bush,s March visit to Pakistan, GOP officials have expressed satisfaction with the visit and its outcomes.  President Musharraf and PM Aziz have repeatedly said that the visit went as they expected, and that it strengthened Pakistan,s strategic relationship with the US and institutionalized dialogue on energy, economic relations, and defense cooperation.  President Musharraf, in particular, has led the way in trying to give the visit a positive spin. Sitting through an hour-long barrage of negative and pointed questions from eminent newspaper editors, Musharraf insisted that he was pleased that the President overnighted in Pakistan, and that he mentioned the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute.  ...BUT CONCERNED ABOUT THE US-INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR INITIATIVE --------------------------------------------- ------------- 3. (C) MFA officials*notably FM Kasuri and Pakistani Ambassador to the US Karamat*were initially positive about the visit, but their favorable comments were subsequently overshadowed by their criticisms of the US-India civil nuclear deal.  The MFA criticized the deal on two (mutually inconsistent) fronts, arguing on the one hand that it would destroy the NPT and on the other that in the interest of regional stability, Pakistan should get a similar deal.  On March 16, FM Kasuri told the "Financial Times" that "Once this (deal) goes through, the NPT will be finished.  It's not just Iran and North Korea.  Brazil, Argentina, and Pakistan will all think differently." (Kasuri subsequently maintained to the Ambassador that his remarks were distorted.)  On March 17, the Foreign Ministry issued a press-release saying, "The grant of a waiver as a special case will have serious implications for the security environment in South Asia, as well as for international non-proliferation efforts.  The objective of strategic stability in South Asia(would have been better served if the United States had considered a package approach for Pakistan and India."  Continuing on this track, it also stated, "The Agreement...would only encourage India to continue its weapons programme without any constraint.  On its part, Pakistan would not accept any discriminatory treatment...Pakistan will neither be oblivious to our security requirements, nor to the needs of our economic development, which demand growth in the energy sector, including civilian nuclear power generation.8 Ambassador told PM Aziz that official comment critical of the nuclear deal was helpful to neither Pakistan nor the US. Aziz agreed.  There has been no further official word on the issue over the last week or so.  OPPOSITION WELCOMES DEMOCRACY FOCUS ----------------------------------- 4. (U)  In the days following President Bush's visit, opposition politicians who routinely criticize US policy towards Pakistan hailed President Bush,s statements on democracy.  PPP Chairperson Benazir Bhutto, former Pakistani  ISLAMABAD 00005307  002 OF 002   Ambassador to the US Syeda Abida Hussain, and Jamait-e Islami officials took the President's statement that the 2007 elections should be fair as a very positive sign.  Bhutto was particularly effusive in her praise, telling reporters that the President's statement pushing for a democratic future and fair elections reflected the sentiments of the Pakistani people.  She also praised the President for assuring Pakistanis that "Washington,s commitment to democracy applies to America's allies as well."  Jamait-e Islami deputy Liaquat Baloch and other MMA leaders took the President's speech as a sign that Musharraf would have to take off his uniform immediately and hold new elections, because "the US is watching."  "GIVE US SOMETHING JUST AS GOOD" -------------------------------- 5. (C) Despite the efforts of Pakistani and US officials to de-link the US-Pakistan and US-India relationship, many Pakistani politicians and the ordinary public want equal treatment with India.  This theme has emerged repeatedly in a drumbeat of negative editorials and articles, and in private conversations with GOP officials.  For example, NDC Commandant LTG Raza Muhammed Khan told A/S Hillen during his recent Pakistan visit that "New Delhi received far more than it deserved" during the President's visit.  PML Senator Asif Jatoi complained to Poloff that once India got the landmark civil-nuclear deal, "you needed to give us something big."  6. (SBU) Most government officials attempted to stay positive in the face of such media criticism.  Musharraf told critics that they were not being rational, saying "it should not bother us what the US does with India, because those relationships should be viewed independently."  Others, such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs Additional Secretary (Americas) Shahid Kamal have told US officials that as a result of the "big" deliverables given to India, the Pakistani public now has higher expectations for the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship.  He suggested that US assistance in education and increased market access for Pakistani textiles could help improve public perceptions that the US values its relationship with India more than its relations with Pakistan.  COMMENT ------- 7. (C) President Musharraf and senior leaders understand the significance of the President's visit and appreciate his comments on Kashmir and his willingness to overnight in Islamabad.  The fact that most other Pakistanis have a jaundiced view is not surprising, given decades of rivalry with India and a festering ambivalence about relations with the US.  We expect popular perceptions will change over time as we begin to put substantive content into the various elements of the composite dialogue.  As official US visitors meet with opposition figures in coming months, we will have an opportunity to put to rest any doubts regarding our commitment to democracy in Pakistan.  End Comment. CROCKER

(S)  The GOP has not specifically agreed or refused to support the request to amend the LET designation.  (Note: Most GOP officials appeared to view the amendment to include JuD as inevitable.  End note.)  MFA officials have, however, consistently affirmed the GOP's commitment to honor its international obligation to implement and enforce 1267 Committee sanctions against designated individuals and organizations.  4.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  In a March 29 conversation, Afghan Ambassador Tarzi told Ambassador that he feels that the atmosphere between Islamabad and Kabul is clearing.  On the eve of his return to Kabul for consultations, Tarzi said that he sensed that the GOP is eager to put aside the heated public rhetoric that followed President Karzai's February visit to Islamabad.  His government is also ready to move on, Tarzi said, noting that he is already making arrangements to convene the Pak-Afghan Joint Economic Commission (JEC), perhaps as early as 26-27 April.  He sees the JEC as an opportunity for an early high-level visit between the governments, a goal the Pakistani MFA shares.  What is important, Tarzi said, is that the visit is high-level and high-visibility.  Tarzi even had praise for the GOP's prompt reaction when the Afghan Consulate in Quetta was threatened by a mob protesting the execution-style deaths of 17 Pakistani nationals, whose bodies were discovered near Spin Boldak on the Afghan side of the border.  The police who responded protected the facility, while an unknown speaker addressed the crowd to urge calm, calling for good relations between the neighboring countries.  2.  (S)  Ambassador Crocker agreed that the atmosphere has improved, saying that despite the publicity surrounding the Spin Boldak incident, the GOP has been restrained in its reaction.  He also cited ISI Director General Kayani's March 29 discussions on intelligence sharing with his Afghan counterparts as a positive development.  The Ambassador also praised President Karzai's decision to commit an Afghan National Army (ANA) unit to participate in the joint U.S.-Pakistani military exercise "Inspired Gambit" in North West Frontier Province in May.  3.  (C)  Tarzi said that, even during the height of the bilateral tensions, he had been able to conduct the Embassy's business as usual with no hostility from his Pakistani contacts.  Now, he continued, many are going out of their way to demonstrate their interest in Afghanistan.  Vice Army Chief of Staff GEN Ahsan has gone out of his way to show that there is no ill will, Tarzi said, inviting Afghan GEN Bismullah Khan to attend his son's wedding and planning festivities in Bismullah Khan's honor at the April 19 Tripartite Commission plenary in Islamabad.  Former ISI Chief Azad Durrani has expressed an interest in visiting Kabul in the near future.  4.  (S)  Tarzi also told Ambassador Crocker that he believes that he had sorted through the confusion surrounding an Afghan Ministry of Defense paper that had been wrongly billed to the GOP as Afghanistan's National Security Strategy (NSS).  (Note:  President Musharraf expressed his irritation at the allegedly revanchist tone of this MOD paper to GEN Abizaid during their March 6 meeting.  End note.)  The Government of Afghanistan (GOA) is working on a NSS, Tarzi said, but under the auspices of the National Security Advisor's office.   The MOD paper that had been passed to the GOP was a preliminary draft written for other purposes that has no/no official standing.  Ambassador thanked Tarzi for the explanation, and urged him to convey the same message to senior GOP officials. CROCKER

(S)  Summary:  On March 29, Ambassador called on Foreign Secretary Mohammed Riaz Khan to discuss follow-on action  SIPDIS after the March 3-4 visit by President Bush, particularly a time frame for the Foreign Secretary's Strategic Dialogue discussions with P - U/S Burns and cooperation on establishing Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs).  The Foreign Secretary confirmed that Pakistan has pledged its support for Guatemala's candidacy for the UNSC through an exchange of notes with the Guatemalan Delegation at the UN. The Ambassador noted that movement on various EXBS and pol-mil programs has slackened in recent months following MFA personnel changes and urged the Foreign Secretary to encourage his staff to actively engage on these issues.  The Ambassador noted that the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) refusal to interdict suspect materials in transit to Iran had been noted with great disappointment at the highest levels in Washington.  If a similar case arises in the future, the Ambassador said that the USG would expect greater cooperation from the GOP.  The Ambassador shared the dates that the USG would begin pre-notification of its request to amend the UN 1267 Committee designation of Lashkar-e-Tayyba (LET) to include Jammat-ud-Dawa (JUD), as well as the anticipated date that the U.S. would submit the amendment request to the 1267 Committee.  End summary.  Strategic Dialogue ------------------  2. (C)  The Foreign Secretary said that he, too, is eager to initiate the first round of the Strategic Dialogue talks with U/S Burns.  Reviewing his calendar, he indicated that he would be available to travel to WashDC April 17 - 24; April 28 - May 1; or after May 19; he hoped that some of these dates would coincide with open slots in U/S Burns' calendar. The Ambassador noted that several other bilateral consultations are on the horizons, citing the Defense Consultative Group will meet in WashDC May 1-5 and the to-be-scheduled Economic Dialogue; he asked the Foreign Secretary to consider whether these consultations should be  SIPDIS sequenced or linked in a particular fashion to maximize synergy.  The Foreign Secretary said that the GOP has tasked working groups leader to generate ideas for future dialogues on energy, science and technology, economics and education.  ROZs ----  3. (C) The Ambassador noted that issue of ROZs would receive special attention in the Strategic Dialogue meetings, saying that WashDC policy makers were considering whether to include areas of Balochistan, North West Frontier province (NWFP), the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Pak-Afghan border and Pakistan-adminsitered Kashmir (AJK) in the zones.  USAID is ready to fund a study of how to proceed with the ROZs, but the U.S. would first like to consult with the GOP.  The Foreign Secretary agreed that it is important that the public see quick movement on the ROZs and that he confirm who the Prime Minister's Office's has tasked to manage the process (quickly disclaiming that the MFA would be in charge.)   Later in the conversation, the Foreign Secretary returned to the ROZs, saying that it would be  SIPDIS difficult to attract industries to invest in volatile areas such as the FATA.  He also expressed reservations about the requirement that Pakistani qoods must have a minimum level of  ISLAMABAD 00005382  002 OF 003   Afghan imputs to qualify for ROZ benefits, noting that a tendency toward contrariness could lead the Afghans to sign on to the ROZ concept simply to be in a position to block Pakistans's access to ROZ benefits.  EXBS ----  4. (S)  The Ambassador drew the Foreign Secretary's attention to a slowdown in bilateral interaction on EXBS, pol-mil and other programs in recent months. The Foreign Secretary attributed this to a rough transition in the Disarmament Cell following Nazir Hussain's transfer to the Protocol Office. The Ambassador said that the Embassy would contact the new leadership in the MFA's Disarmament Cell, to re-invigorate this critical area of bilateral cooperation.  Interdiction ------------  5  (S)  The Ambassador told the Foreign Secretary that senior officials in WashDC were severely disappointed that the GOP refused to interdict suspect maritime cargo scheduled to transit the Port of Karachi on March 4 en route to Iran. (Ref A and B)  The Foreign Secretary said that his government had declined the request to interdict in order "to protect" the Bush visit the same day -- if the GOP had acted, he said, negative public reaction would have dominated the news cycle, pushing the good news about the President's visit off the media's radar.  The Foreign Secretary stressed that Pakistan had advised the USG of its decision very quickly and had urged the U.S. to interdict the vessel itself.  He went on to reaffirm the GOP's commitment to prevent Pakistani-produced controlled materials from being exported for illicit purposes, but distinguished this from active interdiction of goods produced elsewhere transiting Pakistan.  The Ambassador reminded the Foreign Secretary that GOP statements opposing nuclear weapons proliferation -- particularly in Pakistan's immediate neighborhood -- will be put the to test should a similar case arise in the future; he expressed the hope that, if called to act, the GOP would not decline next time.  1267 Committee Designation --------------------------  6. (S)  Reminding the Foreign Secretary that the U.S. had deferred moving forward with its request to add JUD to the LET terror financing designation, the Ambassador apprised the Foreign Secretary of the current timeline for pre-notification and presentation to the UN 1267 Committee. (Ref D)  The Ambassador expressed concern over points MFA Spokesperson Tasneem Aslam raised with DCM on March 24, particularly the notion that JUD and other designated organizations should be given special consideration because of their participation in earthquake relief efforts.  On the contrary, the Ambassador continued, we have warned the GOP for months that these organizations were engaged in relief work for this express purpose, reaping the benefits of positive press, increased recruitment opportunities and an expanding financial base.  If the GOP had taken control of these aspects of the relief efforts, and channeled humanitarian-minded militants into this work as part of an organized DDR program, then perhaps Ms. Aslam would have had a point.  As it stands, the USG remains firm in its view that the GOP must take decisive action to bring the militants' relief activities to an end and to vigorously implement the anticipated 1267 Committee designation of JUD.  The Foreign Secretary replied that it is very difficult for the GOP to  SIPDIS act against the militant organizations; that it must consider tools other than coercion to persuade the militants to abandon violence; and that the GOP needs additional  ISLAMABAD 00005382  003 OF 003   information  on the links between the militants and terrorism/terrorist financing in order to explain the situation to the Pakistani people (Ref C).  The Ambassador appreciated the complexities of the situation, but again urged the GOP to ensure that all assets of designated organization have been frozen, in accord with Pakistan's obligations as a member of the UN.

S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 005537  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  H FOR BFLECK H - PLEASE PASS TO HAGEL STAFFER REXON RYU  E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2016 TAGS: EAID, MASS, MOPS, OVIP, PGOV, PK, PREL, PTER SUBJECT: POLITICAL SCENESETTER FOR SENATOR HAGEL  REF: SECSTATE 47580  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  1. (S) The U.S. Mission in Pakistan warmly welcomes your planned April 12-15 visit to Pakistan.  As demonstrated during President Bush's recent visit to Islamabad, both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz are western-oriented modernizers who are trying to move Pakistan toward Musharraf's goal of "enlightened moderation." They viewed the President's visit as a landmark in the relationship and were gratified that he decided to stay overnight in Pakistan.  Your visit comes as Pakistan's leaders have survived the fallout from the Danish cartoon controversy, but remain engaged in suppressing violent separatists in Balochistan, combating al-Qa'ida and extremists in the tribal areas along the Afghan border and transitioning from earthquake relief operations to long-term reconstruction.  Robust USG participation in the earthquake relief effort has promoted a more positive public perception of the United States, but Pakistan remains a tough public diplomacy environment.  We believe that your visit will help us advance key U.S. objectives, including democratization, regional stability and progress in the global war on terror.  The Cartoon Controversy ----------------------- 2. (C) In February and early March, tens of thousands of Pakistani demonstrators took to the streets to protest the publication of the Danish cartoons.  Early rallies in Lahore and Peshawar were particularly destructive, with rampant looting and vandalism in parts of downtown Lahore and Peshawar and six protesters killed.  Although demonstrations followed throughout Pakistan (including a widely-observed nationwide strike on the day of President Bush's arrival), enhanced security measures by the Government of Pakistan (GOP)prevented any repetition of the unrestrained violence seen in February. Over time, the protests took on a greater political tone.  The outrage against the Danes and the EU still festers, fueled by opportunistic politicians who have subverted public sentiment in order to condemn the West as a whole (including the U.S.) and embarrass the Musharraf government.  3.  (C) Following President Bush's lead, your visit presents an opportunity to remind the Pakistani people that the United States understands the sentiments of the Muslim community and that, although we strongly support freedom of expression, we also believe the press should behave responsibly.  More broadly, you will have the opportunity to underscore our desire for warm relations with the Muslim world and for a sustained partnership with Pakistan as it addresses the immediate challenge of earthquake recovery and the long-term challenges of economic development.  Earthquake Relief ----------------- 4. (U) The October 8 earthquake (7.6 on the Richter scale) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was the strongest to hit the region in over a century.  The GOP estimates that more than 73,000 individuals died in the quake, with more than 69,000 wounded and some 2.8 million survivors left homeless.  The United States has been Pakistan's most visible international partner in delivering emergency relief over the last two months.  5.  (U) The U.S. military, which has been on the ground since October 10, will conclude its relief operations on March 31. At the peak of initial relief efforts, more than 1,200 personnel and 24 helicopters provided vital transport, logistics and medical and engineering support in affected areas.  AS we have wrapped up our military relief operations, we have donated more than USD 2.5 million in medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts to ensure that they had the resources necessary to meet the medical needs of the affected community.  Our Seabee unit left behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineers.  6.  (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services in camps and villages.  USAID has provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to help the affected population make it through the harsh Himalayan winter.  In March, USAID made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15 million to rebuild  schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged USD 510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately USD 24 million.  Independent estimates place total U.S. private donations at over USD 130 million.  7.  (C) Our prompt and generous response has initiated a small but perceptible shift in Pakistani attitudes about the United States, improving bilateral relations at official levels.  The hand-in-glove cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army. As we have drawn down our military presence, we have emphasized that our transition parallels the overall shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort. Pakistanis, who have long been convinced that we are fair-weather friends, are beginning to understand that we are interested in a long-term relationship.  Democratization --------------- 8.  (C) President Musharraf has committed - publicly and privately - to move Pakistan toward a civilian-led democracy by the next national elections, which must be held by 2007. U.S. visitors should remind their Pakistani interlocutors (particularly those in the military) of the importance our elected leaders - including President Bush and members of Congress - attach to this transition.  The government must address significant organizational issues before the 2007 national elections, but it has taken an important initial step with the March appointment of a permanent, independent election commissioner acceptable to all mainstream parties. When engaging Pakistani contacts, U.S. officials should reinforce the need for civilian control of the military and for the military's full and permanent disengagement from electoral politics.  At the operational level, USAID supports democratization efforts with programs to promote institutional development of the courts, the legislatures, and the political parties.  Afghanistan ----------- 9.  (S) The roller-coaster relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan continues to suffer from mutual suspicion and recrimination, with Afghans concerned about cross-border infiltration and Pakistan worried that India is using its assets in Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  President Musharraf, his government and military leaders recognize that Pakistan must support the Karzai government as it attempts to solidify its control over the country.  To that end, the Government is committed to cooperating on operational security matters with the Afghan government and coalition forces through regular Tripartite Commission meetings.  That said, the two leaders cannot restrain themselves from engaging in regular bouts of destructive public rhetoric in which each blames the other for not doing enough to effectively prosecute the battle against their common enemies in the tribal areas along the border.  10.  (S) As illustrated by the recent heavy fighting in North and South Waziristan, Pakistan is struggling to curb insurgent activity, challenged by rugged terrain, Pakistan border security forces' limited resources and sometimes uneven support within the Pakistani military,  Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps.  The greatest hurdle is the Government's lack of a coherent strategy in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Afghan border.  We consistently press the GOP to move forcefully against al-Qaida, Taliban and other anti-coalition militants, while simultaneously acknowledging the significant progress Pakistan has made in countering terrorist elements since September 2001.  The recent military operations initiated in North Waziristan by Pakistan's Special Services Group, supported by Pakistan Army Aviation and 11th Corps assets, marks a new level of commitment commensurate with America expectations.  India and Kashmir ----------------- 11.  (S) President Musharraf and his senior advisors have consistently told us that they have made a strategic decision to end the militancy and even Indian officials acknowledge that the level of violence and cross-border infiltration has declined (though New Delhi attributes this to Indian security measures).  President Musharraf believes the GOP's ability to control Kashmiri militants will be greatly enhanced if there is measurable progress with India on Kashmir.  He has specifically pushed for a withdrawal of Indian forces from key population centers in Indian-administered Kashmir (a demand viewed with great skepticism in Delhi).  Musharraf has privately signaled flexibility on final status of Kashmir, but in public remains steadfast in rejecting the Line of Control (LOC) as a permanent international boundary.  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that New Delhi is not afraid to discuss pragmatic solutions to make the LOC less-relevant in people's lives, but has also chided Pakistan for holding normalization of bilateral relations hostage to a final resolution of the Kashmir dispute.  Limited measures following the October earthquake to facilitate cross-LOC travel and communication have the potential to changes the dynamic in Kashmir and may accelerate internal pressure on Islamabad and New Delhi to create additional space for interaction between Kashmiris in India and Pakistan.  12. (C)  While there has been little progress on core issues relating to Kashmir, senior Indian and Pakistani officials meet regularly through the Composite Dialogue process, which has produced some confidence-building measures, including a pre-notification agreement for  ballistic missile launches and the opening of five bus routes between the two countries.  India and Pakistan have also after some 17 years revived the Joint Commission after some twenty years, to provide a forum for discussions on technical issues such as science and technology, information technology, telecommunications, and tourism.  The Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency and the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation recently initiated discussions aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation on human trafficking, currency counterfeiting, and illegal immigration.  13.  (S) India has long resisted the involvement of third parties in settling the Kashmir issue, and Pakistani leaders understand that any move toward a direct mediating role by the U.S. would be counterproductive.  President Musharraf was pleased by President Bush's even-handed statements about the need for good relations between India and Pakistan and for a peaceful and mutually agreeable solution in Kashmir.  Global War on Terrorism ----------------------- 14.  (S) Pakistan deserves commendation for standing with us in the global war on terror, including its efforts to deny al-Qaida and other extremist elements safe haven in Pakistan's untamed tribal areas along the Afghan border. Following the GOP's decision to extend central government control into the FATA (historically a "no go" region for government forces), we have regularly encouraged Pakistani security forces to stay the course in the face of armed resistance.  The Pakistan military has suffered over 1000 casualties in the FATA, with particularly heavy fighting during the first week of March, when militants occupied a key town in North Waziristan.  Since December, the security situation, especially in Waziristan, has deteriorated, forcing the GOP to rethink its strategy. Musharraf has articulated a three-pronged approach comprising political initiatives, economic development and military operations that are faster, leaner and more targeted than in the past. We have offered to assist Pakistan's economic development efforts in the FATA and to provide training and rapid strike capabilities as it realigns its military tactics.  15.  (C) In the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings, President Musharraf cracked down on terrorist/extremist organizations in Pakistan to much public fanfare.  We are still assessing whether the President has the will to hold the line against Pakistan's extremist elements for the long run.  Initial law enforcement actions targeted the usual suspects--conservative clerics and Islamist politicians--prompting a strong popular backlash, with conservatives decrying the focus on Islamists.  Ultimately, the government released most detainees and watered down regulations intended to provide transparency on madrassa operations.  We have repeatedly pressed senior GOP officials to act decisively against the operational leaders of key terrorist and extremist groups, including those involved in earthquake relief efforts in northern Pakistan.  We have also encouraged GOP officials to take action against madrassas that support, recruit for or shelter these organizations.  Balochistan ----------- 16.  (S) Pakistani leaders are also struggling to cope with an insurgency in the resource-rich province of Balochistan, as local Baloch tribesmen seek to redress historic grievances against Pakistan and seize a greater share of their provincial patrimony.  President Musharraf has swung back and forth between civilian advisors who are counseling caution and a negotiated settlement that addresses Baloch concerns, and military advisors who view the insurgency as an Indian-sponsored threat to national unity to be suppressed. At the moment, the pendulum appears ready to swing toward the military option. This has clear implications for the military's ability to pursue shared U.S.-Pakistan objectives in the FATA and in the war on terror.  Pakistani security forces are already over-stretched along the Afghan border, in North and South Waziristan, in earthquake relief and in managing domestic unrest over the cartoons.  An escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year. CROCKER

(S)  Summary:  While sporadic engagements continue between Baloch nationalists and military and Frontier Corps units, the Pakistan government has recently announced a series of political and economic initiatives to address some of Balochistan's long-standing grievances, including promises of more federal jobs and more money.  Based on initial soundings among journalists, NGO reps and political figures, the grassroots response to the government's initiatives ranges from the dismissive to the (very) cautiously optimistic.  It will be a long time before these kinds of announcements deliver a bankable political dividend; despite government hopes,they will not drive a wedge between renegade Baloch sardars and their supporters. However, they may serve the government's broader interest by convincing the Pakistani public that continued resistance by the sardars is unreasonable.  End Summary.  The Charm Offensive -------------------  2.  (U)  Even as clashes continue between security forces and Baloch tribesman, the government has announced in recent weeks a set of political and economic initiatives for Balochistan designed to address long-standing Baloch grievances.  --  On March 17, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, President of the ruling Muslim League party announced that people from other provinces working in the Baloch port city of Gwadar would not be allowed to vote or contest in elections for 15 years. (Note: this is designed to address a Baloch concern that recruitment of Punjabis to work at the Gwadar Port would change the demographics and political affiliation of the area.)  -- On March 26, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz visited Quetta and announced that the government would create 30,000 public sector jobs in provincial departments, including the police and Frontier Corps.  (Note: the Baloch complain that they are significantly underrepresented in such jobs.)  He also underscored that a National Finance Commission (NFC) award announced in January by President Musharraf, would give the province an additional Rs 6.0 billion (about $100 million).  --  On March 29, President Musharraf used the inauguration of a $1.7 million gas supply project in Gwadar to underscore the government's commitment to development in Balochistan.  He urged the Ports and Shipping Minister to give preference to Baloch in hiring and announced that the Government would provide $50 million to be distributed to the Nazims of Balochistan's 29 districts to finance development projects. He pledged that he would monitor progress personally.  The Naysayers -------------  3.  (C)  The reaction of Balochis has been predictably mixed, with many Baloch political figures dismissing the announcements as window dressing, and others -- principally independent journalists -- taking a cautiously optimistic posture.  Baloch nationalists, including Chairman of the Baloch National Movement Ghulam Mohammad, and Jamhoori Watan Party Information Secretary Amanullah Kandarani insist that the announcements are a fraud and that if the government is serious it should withdraw the army from Dera Bugti and Kohlu and release Baloch prisoners.  4.  (C)  Former Chief Secretary of Balochistan Hakim Baloch told PolCounselor that the core issue is the right of the local population to have a say in provincial affairs and rights to Balochistan's land and resources.  Sending the Prime Minister to "directly distribute checks" actually exacerbated the Baloch sense of powerlessness and frustration.  Moreover, he anticipated that most Baloch would view the government's announcements as "eyewash" because the government had a very poor record of keeping its promises.  5.  (C)  Ishaq Baloch, Central Information Secretary of the Baloch National Party said that while the party welcomed the  ISLAMABAD 00005596  002 OF 003   announcements, it remained skeptical.  Musharraf had visited Gwadar three years ago and announced the establishments of a university and polytechnical institute, but so far nothing had materialized.  People would not be satisfied until concrete steps were taken.  "We do not want jobs or special announcements," he added, "just give us what the constitution says: a quota of 5.3 percent in all federal services."  He claimed that out of 40,000 people employed in Wah Cantonment, only two were Baloch.  Ultimately, the only lasting solution was political: Islamabad should act as a "federating center," not a "governing center."  A PML politician, Sardar Wazir Ahmed Jogezai, offered the same assessment .  Three years ago Musharraf had promised an amnesty on agricultural loans, but to this day Baloch farmers were still paying off their loans with interest.  People would not be satisfied until there were free and fair elections and had a government of their own choosing.  6.  (C)  Sher Ali Mazari, an Islamabad-based relation of Nawab Bugti and a regular Embassy contact, also doubted that the announcements would have an impact.  First, the Baloch would expect that given the level of corruption in the provincial bureaucracy, little of the promised money would reach them.  Second, ongoing military operations had threatened or displaced Baloch populations in 8 districts. He estimated that there had been 600 civilian casualties to date, with up to 200,000 thousand people displaced. (Comment: in post's judgment these number appear significantly inflated. End Comment.) Third, ordinary Balochis continued to experience regular indignities at the hands of Punjabis.  He estimated that there were 300-550 checkpoints in Balochistan, manned by the Frontier Corps or other services.  "If you are a Baloch, going from Karachi to Quetta, you are taken off the bus several times and harassed by people who don't speak your language," he explained.  7.  (S)  Mazari concluded that the initiatives would have no major impact and confided that senior figures in Islamabad agree, citing by name NSA Tariq Aziz, and Muslim League leaders Chaudhry Shujaat and Mushahid Hussain (strictly protect).  He had met each of them within the last two weeks, he said, and had seen Aziz the previous day (March 30). While each of them viewed the economic and political initiatives as positive, they also considered them insufficient and worried that they were being undercut by recourse to the military option.  (Note: Mazari reported that Aziz was concerned that Musharraf was not getting good information from his Director General of Military Intelligence.  Aziz had confided to Mazari that the DGMI advised Musharraf that only 3 percent of Baloch people supported the Sardars, that the whole of Balochistan was pleased that Musharraf was "sorting out" the Sardars and that even the Baloch nationalist Dr. Hayee Baloch was pleased with Musharraf's vigorous stance.  Mazari had told Aziz that all three assertions were preposterous and had arranged a meeting for Aziz with Dr. Baloch at his own home, where Baloch told Aziz this directly. End Note.)  The Cautious Optimists ----------------------  8.  (C)  In contrast to Baloch political figures, a number of journalist contacts and NGO representatives familiar with Balochistan were cautiously optimistic.   Toseef Saba, Editor of the paper Nara-I-Haq admitted that Baloch apprehensions were justified in view of previous unfulfilled promises. He said he worried that people around Musharraf were "spoiling his good intentions," but nonetheless he had heard the speeches of Musharraf and Shaukat Aziz and was convinced that they were sincere.  "Let's see what happens now," he concluded.  9.  (C)  Another journalist, Shazada Zulfiqar, reports that he met last week with nationalist Sardars Nawab Akbar Bugti and Baloch Marri and that both were optimistic about prospects for negotiations with the government.  He was also heartened by the visits of Musharraf and Aziz to Balochistan, which he interpreted as signs that they were under pressure from the people of Balochistan.  Rahat Malik, a Baloch political analyst, believed the senior visits and announcements had been welcomed by the Baloch people and he  ISLAMABAD 00005596  003 OF 003   expected tensions would begin to ease within a month.  He reported rumors that Nawab Bugti was ready to negotiate a settlement.  10.  (C)  A Program officer with a microcredit NGO active in Balochistan acknowledged that the government had been very slow to deliver on past promises, but he was hopeful that this time it would be different.  He gave Musharraf the credit for restarting the Saindak mineral extraction project in Balochistan and for building dams in the province.  These projects might not show results for years, but from his vantage working on micro-credit he had already seen measurable economic improvements even in remote areas of Balochistan.   Yes, most Balochis were probably skeptical, he judged, but the government had an opportunity to prove them wrong.  Comment -------  11.  (C)  The government's pursuit of a two-track policy -- using sticks with the Baloch separatists and carrots with the broader Baloch population -- is sensible, but the missteps and broken promises of the past work against the strategy. It will be years before the Baloch people see the jobs and improved living standards that could overcome their skepticism about the government's intentions. Given the comparative backwardness of the province, it will be many more years (if ever) before the Baloch people are educationally and economically on an equal footing with other provinces.  Restoring stability in the short term would require directly engaging the renegade sardars and far-reaching political steps to give the Baloch people a greater say in provincial affairs and greater control over the province's resources.  Although the announcement of these economic initiatives will have limited impact in Balochistan, it may serve the government by convincing other Pakistanis that Islamabad has made a credible effort, laying the groundwork for possible military action.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S) Introduction:  Srinagar-based Kashmiri separatist leader Yasin Malik has told post that he has used his extended March-April 2006 visit to Pakistan to reach out to Kashmiri militant leaders, counseling them to lay down their arms and give the peace process a chance.  In between highly-publicized addresses to the Pugwash Conference (March 7-8, Islamabad) (reftel), the World Social Forum (March 24-25, Karachi) and an International Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IIPCR) seminar of conflict resolution in Kashmir (April 3, Islamabad) and meetings with high-level Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials, Malik balanced his assessment that the time for armed struggle has ended with a call for India and Pakistan talk to the militants directly, giving them a role in the peace process.  Malik's message, which coincided with rumors that the GOP is tightening the screws on the Kashmiri militants, may be gaining ground with key militancy leaders.   End introduction.  GOP Tightening the Purse Strings? ---------------------------------  2.  (S)  Malik's early March arrival in Pakistan coincided with press reports and rumors circulating in Islamabad  that the ISI had summoned the leaders of the Kashmiri militancy for a March 8 meeting in which the GOP thanked the militants for their struggle, but then told them to lay down their arms and give the bilateral peace process a chance.  Several POL contacts confirmed that such a meeting occurred; the militant leaders responded to the orders to stand down and cuts in their GOP-subsidies by staging a ten-day protest, refusing to leave the safe house in which the March 8 meeting took place.  Although the details varied, most accounts agreed on the basic message:  that the time has come for the militants to stop the violence, to allow space for  President Musharraf and Prime Minister Singh to move forward with peace initiatives.  3. (S)  Mohammed Rafiq Dar, Secretary General - Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF - Yasin Malik branch), offered the most detailed description of the meeting and its aftermath. Dar, who was shepherding Malik's visit to Pakistan,  said that the confusion amongst the UJC leaders following the March 8 meeting created an opening for Malik to advocate a cease fire.  For example, Dar said that Malik held several conversations with Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) leader Mohammed Yusuf Shah (aka "Salahuddin" or "Syed Salahuddin," a heavy-hitter in the UJC), who said that he found himself joining the strike simply out of comradeship, swept along as the other militants reacted impulsively to the GOP's message.   HM:  On Board, or Not? ----------------------  4. (S)  Malik and Dar told poloffs that subsequent conversations with the HM leader reinforcing the message to stop the violence and support the peace process led to Salaluddin's public statement, reported in the "Daily Times" on March 31, that "not only HM but the entire militant leadership would consider (a) truce if the Indian government acknowledges the disputed and tripartite nature of the Kashmir issue."  Saying that the dialogue between New Delhi and the moderate All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leadership in recent months has so far failed, Salahuddin said that armed confrontation would automatically recede as serious dialogue process moves forward."   (Note:  The syntax of Salahuddin's remark suggesting that the militancy would naturally die off if only the militants were given a seat at the table indicates that it was lifted straight from Malik's talking points, which paraphrase Preseident Musharraf's own thinking. End note.)  5.  (U)  Two days later, the April 2 edition of the Daily Times reported on HM spokesperson deriding the peace process and the Kashmiri politicians (i.e., the APHC) who had joined  ISLAMABAD 00005767  002 OF 002   it.  The article quoted an HM press statement as saying that mujahideen would only encourage a dialogue process that focuses on Kashmiri self-determination. Interestingly, the article quoted complaints from an unnamed senior HM official that "for the past two or three years, they (the Pakistani government) have withdrawn all sorts of support from us and recently, we received messages that there should be no more cross border movement."  6.  (S)  Despite the back-sliding in the April 2 HM statement, during a brief exchange on the margins of the IIPCR seminar on April 3, Malik and Dar reaffirmed to poloff that Salahuddin is on board with the move toward a cease fire...and that he is in a position to help Malik bring other UJC leaders along.  Comments --------  7.  (S) As celebrated Kashmiris moderates like Malik and APHC leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (who also stayed on for a week of public appearances and official meetings following the World Social Forum) have traveled across the LOC with some frequency in the past year, their dialogue with the Pakistani public has drawn out common threads: a call for all parties -- including the Kashmiri militants -- to renounce the use of violence; support for President Musharraf's initiatives for pursuing the peace process; and insistence that Kashmiri voices (including the militants) be included in the peace process. (Note:  Malik advocated the "Nagaland model" as instructive in all of his conference presentations.  End note.)  Aside from these themes, however, what has been equally apparent to Pakistan observers is the failure of Kashmiri leaders to come to a consensus as to who speaks for Kashmir, who will get the seat at the table.  For example, Malik's vision of a trilateral peace process is a far cry from ecumenical, including hard-core militants but excluding "pro-India" Kashmiris such as Omar Abdullah.  8.  (S)  Both Malik and Dar were eager to update poloffs on their campaign to promote the Kashmir peace process and build a constituency for Malik's vision of the way forward, with a trilateral dialogue that includes direct talks with Kashmir militants.  They took pains to note that, when confronted with popular disappointment that the Kashmir dispute did not receive greater visibility during the recent POTUS visit, Malik defended President Bush's remarks calling for a resolution acceptable to all parties and endorsing the U.S. preference for "quiet diplomacy" as the right choice.  Their openess with poloffs, and repeated endorsements of behind-the-scenes U.S. facilitation of the peace process, reflect in equal measure Malik's interest in building a constituency for his primacy amongst moderate Kashmiri leader and his efforts to persuade militants to give peace a chance.  Malik and Dar have other reasons to cultivate USG support -- Malik plans to travel to New York in a few weeks for medical treatment; Dar continues to hope for a positive adjudication of his pending visa application so that he can accompany Malik on his trip.  9.  (S)  Malik's visit offered poloffs an unusual opportunity to assess GOP assurances of a clamp down on the Kashmiri militancy.  Malik and Dar monitor the militants closely; their confirmation that Kashmiri militants are chafing under the GOP clamp down and that some militancy leaders are inclined to tow the line, is encouraging.  The minimal public controversy surrounding Musharraf's Kashmir policy suggests that he has largely succeeded in changing the terms of reference.  Whereas Pakistanis have historically seen the conflict as a matter of Pakistani's national claim to Kashmir, it is increasingly viewed here as a matter of Kashmiri rights.  Recent visits by Malik, the Mirwaiz and even Omar Abdullah (who praised Musharraf's initiaves following the President's meeting with Pugwash participants) are reinforcing this new perspective.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ISLAMABAD 005787  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, OTRA, PKMN, PHUM, PREL SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR G/TIP GAYATRI PATEL  REF: STATE 53490  1.  Post welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Gayatri Patel from April 9 to April 14.  Post also does not object to Consulate Lahore granting post clearance.  The purpose of the visit is gather additional information on the GOP's anti-trafficking efforts.  2.  Control officer for the visit will be Political Officer Mohammed Motiwala.  He can be reached at the following numbers: Embassy: 92-51-208-0000; Office: 92-51-208-2624; Cell: 0300-501-2202.  3.  Control officer will meet visitor upon arrival at the airport in Islamabad.  Transportation will be provided to the airport on the day of departure.  Please inform control officer of any change in itinerary.  4.   Visitors must/must obtain separate post clearance if they plan to visit any of the three Mission Pakistan consulates (Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore) or any other areas under the jurisdiction of the consulates.  Most travel outside of Islamabad will require separate post clearance. Post clearance for the consulates should be requested via cable to the consulate(s) on the planned itinerary.  5. Visas: Everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  6.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  7.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  8.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section,  ISLAMABAD 00005787  002 OF 004   or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  9.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  10.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  11. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services:  NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED).  TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the  ISLAMABAD 00005787  003 OF 004   following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance  ISLAMABAD 00005787  004 OF 004   either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.  CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 005822  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2016 TAGS: ENRG, MNUC, PGOV, PK, IN, PREL SUBJECT: A/S BOUCHER AND PAKISTANI FM KASURI DISCUSS U-S INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR INITIATIVE   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d.  1.  (C) Summary: In an April 4 meeting with visiting SCA Assistant Secretary Boucher, Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri repeated Pakistan's request that the U.S. consider a "package deal" on civil nuclear cooperation that would include Pakistan as well as India. At a minimum, the U.S. should choose its words carefully to hold open the possibility that Pakistan might be included in the future. He complained that a deal that excluded Pakistan would undermine goodwill generated by U.S. earthquake assistance and contribute to a perception that the U.S. was an unreliable ally. Kasuri also expressed concern that the deal would indirectly bolster India's strategic nuclear program. A/S Boucher affirmed the U.S. commitment to Pakistan and stressed that the U.S. would deal with India and Pakistan based on their distinct needs (with Pakistan receiving some benefits not offered to India).  He reiterated the U.S. conviction that the Civil Nuclear Initiative would lead to more power plants, not more weapons. End Summary.  2.  (C) Kasuri noted that the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative had generated significant domestic criticism in Pakistan.  The Pakistan Government had waited a decent interval before voicing its concerns that the Initiative was not a package deal (i.e., extending to both India and Pakistan).  3.  (C) Kasuri expressed concern that the deal with India would erode the goodwill that had been generated by U.S. earthquake assistance and feed into a long-standing Pakistani perception that the U.S. was an unreliable friend.  People felt "let down" he said, and they worried that history was repeating itself.  Kasuri suggested "changing the language" used to describe U.S. reservations about a similar nuclear initiative with Pakistan.  He recommended latching onto Secretary Rice's formulation "for the time being" and  SIPDIS regretted Energy Secretary Bodman's statement that such an initiative with Pakistan "was not possible."  4.  (C) A/S Boucher responded that the relationship with Pakistan was very important to the United States and that Pakistan's success as a moderate, democratic nation was a top administration priority.  The depth of U.S. commitment had already been amply demonstrated diplomatically, financially and in terms of personal relations among the leaders.  With respect to perceptions of the President's visit, Pakistanis should stop to consider that Pakistan had also received deliverables that India had not, such as a range of educational initiatives and trade initiatives, including the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones.  The intent of dehyphenation was that each country's particular needs should be addressed.   Nor was the United States oblivious to Pakistan's security concerns, A/S Boucher continued, recalling how India had earlier reacted (negatively) to the granting of Major Non-NATO Ally status to Pakistan.  5.  (C) A/S Boucher observed that there are strong arguments to counter concerns raised by the non-proliferation community.  As a consequence of the agreement, India's available facilities to produce enriched fuel for weapons would be halved. Kasuri responded by expressing concern that the agreement would permit India to use all of its domestically produced fuel for weapons once it could import fuel for power generation.  Boucher replied that this argument would only hold if availability of fuel were a genuine constraint on India's weapons program, which it was not; in any case, nations habitually put their security concerns foremost.  If there were a trade-off between weapons and energy, weapons would prevail.  The U.S. had analyzed the Initiative carefully and was convinced that it would lead to more power plants, not more weapons.  6.  (C) Kasuri countered by observing that the same logic should apply to Pakistan.  What was achieved by denying Pakistan access to nuclear energy?  By 2030, Pakistan would be the fourth largest country in the world (in terms of population), and without cleaner fuel there would be implications for the global environment.  Pakistan understood the damage done by AQ Khan (though it chafed at being repeatedly reminded), but how could it now move forward?  7.  (C) A/S Boucher underscored that the United States was a  ISLAMABAD 00005822  002 OF 002   long-time champion of the NPT and non-proliferation regime. Thus it was not a question of why Pakistan was being denied the nuclear option.  It was rather a question of why India was uniquely qualified, and the U.S. saw only one set of circumstances that merited this exception.  8.  (C) Note: the nuclear power issue also came up in a subsequent meeting, reported separately, that the A/S held with Foreign Secretary Khan.  Khan argued that the initiative was a "missed opportunity" for a package deal that would have included Pakistan, and that instead it had created an "optic of discrimination."  Pakistan had a case, he said, and would continue to press it.  End Note.  9.  (U) This cable has been cleared by A/S Boucher. CROCKER

STATE 52795      B. ISLAMABAD 5357      C. ISLAMABAD 5382      D. ISLAMABAD 5070  Classified By: DCM Peter W. Bodde, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (S)  On April 5, Poloff delivered Ref A talking points and background papers on Laskhar-e-Tayyba (LET) and Al-Akhtar Trust to MFA (UN) Director Imran Siddiqui.  Poloff pressed Siddiqui of the importance the U.S. places on full and vigorous implementation of UN 1267 Committee terror finance sanctions, regardless of legal challenges filed by designated entities in a member country's domestic courts.  Poloff also suggested that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) refine its request for releasable information on designated entities such as JUD, Al-Akhtar Trust and Al-Rashid Trust, specifying areas in which it has factual gaps in its own information. Poloff also asked Siddiqui whether the GOP would support the coming U.S. request to the 1267 Committee to amend the LET designation to include Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its aliases.  2.  (S)  Siddiqui thanked poloff for the two background papers and said that the GOP would follow-up on the suggestion to submit more focused requests for information on these designated entities.  Reaffirming the GOP's commitment to combating terrorism, he said that all 1267 Committee sanctions have been fully implemented against LET, Al-Akhtar Trust and Al-Rashid Trust and that they remain in effect, regardless of ongoing challenges in Pakistan's domestic courts.  Siddiqui commented on the public opposition to the GOP's implementation of terror finance sanctions, which are popularly perceived as having a foreign genesis; in the GOP's view, this widespread public perception makes the government's efforts to persuade Islamists to turn away from violence significantly more challenging.  3.  (S)  Comment:  Regarding Department's concern raised in Raf A, para 3, post does not believe that the GOP misunderstands the nature of international legal obligations under UNSCR 1267. To the contrary, the GOP fully understands its obligation to implement 1267 Committee terror finance sanctions.  Its request for information (Ref B) related specifically to its need to respond to domestic legal challenges by designees. These domestic court cases have the potential to rile Pakistani public opinion that is already largely antagonistic to designations, which are viewed at the grassroots level as unwarranted attacks on Muslim charitable organizations.  An offer of practical assistance on legal strategies for responding to domestic challenges to 1267 Committee terror finance sanctions, such as consultations with DOJ attorneys handling similar cases in the U,S., might boost the GOP's appetite for proactive measures against designated entities.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 005903  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2016 TAGS: PREL, IN, AF, PK, IR SUBJECT: A/S BOUCHER DISCUSSES REGIONAL ISSUES WITH PAKISTANI FM KASURI AND FOREIGN SECRETARY KHAN   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b.  1.  (C) Summary.  SCA Assistant Secretary Boucher reviewed a range of regional issues in separate April 4 discussions with Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri and Foreign Secretary Khan.  Kasuri and Khan were optimistic on relations with India, taking heart from PM Singh's recent speech in Amritsar and the prospect of progress on Siachen and Sir Creek in advance of a possible visit by Singh in coming months.  Khan emphasized the need for progress on the core issue of Kashmir.  Kasuri and Khan underscored that Pakistan wanted stability in Afghanistan, but expressed frustration that Pakistan is criticized abroad for not doing enough against the Taliban while at home it is viewed as serving as an American stooge.  On Iran, A/S Boucher underscored the need for the international community to stand together in pushing Iran to abide by its commitments. Khan agreed that Pakistan should do more to build relations with Central Asian states. A/S Secretary Boucher's discussions of the Strategic Dialogue and of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative are reported in septels.  End Summary.  India/Kashmir -------------  2.  (C) Kasuri underscored that he was a believer in the Indo-Pak peace process, which Pakistan was pursuing out of self-interest.  Settling Kashmir would remove a significant factor underlying Islamic extremism in the region and would help Pakistan achieve its objective of becoming a moderate, democratic Moslem state.  3.  (C) There had already been significant progress on a number of fronts, Kasuri said, and there was "an even chance" the parties could resolve the longstanding disputes over Siachen and Sir Creek.  Kasuri welcomed Indian PM Manmohan Singh's recent speech in Amritsar, especially his call for "practical and pragmatic" solutions -- words that Musharraf had also used.  He noted that Musharraf was now interacting with a range of Kashmiri representatives -- including pro-Indian ones -- and that these Kashmiri voices were now putting pressure on India.  He expected that PM Singh might visit Pakistan in coming months, possibly to finalize deals on Siachen and Sir Creek.  4.  (C) A/S Boucher explained that as the U.S. looks to promote broad regional markets in central Asia, it views India as a destination.  Kasuri responded that this was "no problem" -- Pakistan had crossed that bridge in the context of discussions over the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. Boucher also noted that the U.S. is seeking observer status in SAARC.  5.  (C) A/S Boucher noted U.S. support for a strategic restraint regime between Pakistan and India.  Kasuri agreed, saying that Pakistan had sought to include missiles in the talks, and remained ready for that.  Pakistan favored strategic restraint, he said.  6.  (C) A/S Boucher stressed that, the U.S. wanted to be helpful on Kashmir.  President Bush had mentioned Kashmir in the U.S. prior to his visit as well as in India and in Pakistan.  This was the moment to move forward: President Musharraf had advanced ideas, India was looking for "practical and pragmatic" approaches; Prime Minister Singh was interested in a soft border.  7.  (C) Echoing Kasuri, Foreign Secretary Riaz Khan said there had been significant progress with India in the Composite Dialogue, but not enough movement on the key issues, especially Kashmir.  Trade with India was opening up as "negative lists" continued to shrink; however, even with lowered tariffs, Pakistan's most competitive exports had low profit margins and were priced out of the Indian market.  8.  (C) Khan confirmed that there were differences with India over transit trade with Afghanistan.  India wanted a land route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, but it was an issue that needed to be looked at in an "overall perspective"  ISLAMABAD 00005903  002 OF 003   taking into account the lack of progress on "the issues" (i.e., primarily Kashmir).  Pakistan did allow one-way transit trade from Afghanistan to India, and on a case by case basis it had allowed some Indian humanitarian goods to transit to Afghanistan.  9.  (C) Khan was encouraged by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's mention of "consultative mechanisms" in his Amritsar speech, but said there was limited progress on the ground. Pakistan had hoped for more freedom of movement across the Line of Control, and continued to hope for progress towards demilitarization of the area.  It was important for the Kashmiris to see real change.  Pakistan had hoped India would consider redeploying out of Kashmiri population centers; if it didn't work, Indian forces could always return.  If India wanted symmetry, Pakistan would "thin out" troops and close camps on its side of the Line of Control.  10. (C) Khan said the ball was in India's court on Siachen. In his view, the dispute would be resolved if India could agree to a demilitarized zone on the glacier.  The next step on Sir Creek was to conduct a joint survey once there was agreement on the extent of the area to be surveyed.  Afghanistan -----------  11.  (C) Foreign Minister Kasuri complained that Pakistan was being criticized on all sides.  The Afghans and the western press accused Pakistan of playing a "double game" and not really going after the Taliban.  Pakistanis meanwhile accused their leaders of being U.S. stooges, taking and inflicting casualties needlessly.   Kasuri asked that the United States make clear that in its assessment Pakistan is not playing a double game.  12.  (C) A/S Boucher observed that while it might not be possible to satisfy the New York Times, both the Administration and Congress understood what Pakistan was doing and were strongly committed to the relationship.  It was important that people in both countries understand that the U.S. and Pakistan were cooperating in a broad range of areas.  The Administration had already been clear that no country has captured more Al Qaida or lost more people doing so than Pakistan.   The public needed to understand that dangerous people were moving back and forth across the border, posing a threat to all parties, and that the solution was to help both countries work cooperatively to extend their control in the border region.   In addition to words, however, both countries must take tangible steps to work together in the Tripartite Commission and other fora to advance common objectives, including customs administration, economic development and counter-narcotics.  13.  (C) Foreign Secretary Riaz Khan stressed that Pakistan wanted stability in Afghanistan, but that the fragmentation among ethnic groups and regions created significant challenges.  Afghan Pashtuns were "ruffled," though it helped that Karzai was Pashtun himself. Much was at stake for Pakistan, he explained, because while Afghanistan might have 10-13 million Pashtuns, Pakistan had 32 million, including many Afghan refugees.  14.  (C) Speaking frankly, Riaz Khan said that Pakistan was tired of being told "do more, do more" to stabilize the region.  It had already lost hundreds of troops.  "What more do you want us to do? Strafe villages?" The tribal areas would not change overnight, he added, because extremism was a mindset.  Pakistan was also eager to work with Afghanistan in combating narcotics, Khan said, suggesting that legalizing some poppy cultivation might help.  A/S Boucher expressed caution about the legalization option, given Afghanistan's limited institutional capacity to execute a strictly limited program, but said he was encouraged that for the first time Afghanistan was implementing all the elements of its counternarcotics strategy, including eradication, interdiction and alternative livelihoods.  15.  (C) As he had with Foreign Minister Kasuri, A/S Boucher  ISLAMABAD 00005903  003 OF 003   noted that Afghanistan was interested in establishing a strategic level dialogue with Pakistan to address common problems in the border region -- as had Kasuri, Khan agreed.  Central Asia --------------  16.  (C) Khan reported that he had been one of Pakistan's first Ambassadors in Central Asia, serving in Kazakhstan in 1992. At the time, turbulence in Afghanistan had been a physical barrier to relations and a political barrier, after Pakistan was "credited" with supporting the Taliban and other Islamic groups that were viewed with misgivings in Central Asia.  There was clearly potential to expand relations given that Pakistan offered access to the Arabian Sea.   Pakistan no longer had many students from Central Asia, Khan said, especially now that foreign madrassa students were being expelled.   Khan agreed with A/S Boucher that Pakistan should consider offering scholarships to Central Asian students, and that there was much Pakistan could offer in terms of exposure to business, journalism, public policy, economic reform and a sense of democracy.  Iran ----  17.  (C) A/S Boucher told Khan that it was important for Iran to get the message that there is unity in the international community.  Following the Security Council statement, Iran had 30 days to "rectify the problem;" it would be constructive if Pakistan could use any opportunity to underscore that message.  Khan responded that Pakistan had been reminding Iran of its obligations, but Iran insisted that it was not weaponizing.  A/S Boucher repeated that Iran had 30 days.  Iran's behavior was "highly offensive" across the board, he added.  It was violating its commitments, funding terrorists, opposing the Middle East peace process and interfering in Iraq. Iran needed to hear that it was time for them to honor commitments they had voluntarily taken on themselves.  18.  (C) Assistant Secretary Boucher has cleared this message. CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 005931  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2016 TAGS: PREL, PK, KPKO, UN, MASS SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: POSSIBLE GOP TROOP CONTRIBUTION TO UN DARFUR MISSION  REF: STATE 51776  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1. (C)  On April 5, poloff presented reftel demarche points to MFA (UN) Director Imran Siddiqui.  Siddiqui said that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) was aware of the text of UNSCR 1663, but had not yet received a request from UN/DPKO to contribute troops or logistical support for a Darfur peacekeeping operation (PKO).  Siddiqui said that he was not aware of any diplomatic sensitivities that would lead the GOP to decline to participate in a UN-led Darfur PKO, but that he could not speak to whether Pakistan's military services are in a position to add this PKO to the many others in which they are already serving.  Siddiqui said that the MFA would circulate reftel points to the appropriate GOP agencies to initiate an interagency discussion to determine whether the GOP would contribute to the Darfur UN mission.  2.  (C)  Post's Office of the Defense Attache (DAO) advises that the GOP presently participates in 11 UN-led PKOs, with more than 9630 troops, military observers and police currently blue-hatted (approximately 7.6% of the 73,034 total UN mission personnel).  As of February 28, Pakistani forces were serving in UN PKOs in:  -- Western Sahara (MINURSO) - 7 observers -- Haiti (MINUSTAH) - 250 police -- D.R. of the Congo (MONUC) - 3563 troops, 43 observers -- Burundi (ONUB) -- 1193 troops, 5 observers -- Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) -- 374 troops, 11 observers -- Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) -- 1 police, 1 observer -- Timor-Leste (UNOTIL -- 4 police, 2 observers -- Kovoso (UNMIK) -- 158 police, 1 observer -- Liberia (UNMIL) -- 2731 troops, 5 police, 16 observers -- Sudan (UNMIS) -- 1202 troops, 23 police, 21 observers -- India/Pakistan (UNMOGIP) -- 10 observers  3.  (C)  Without knowing how many troops the UN DPKO is contemplating for the Darfur mission, post can offer only a rough estimate of the GOP's potential contribution.  ODRP suggests requesting a brigade level of commitment (roughly 2200 troops) as an ambitious starting point for a discussion of a Pakistani contribution.  A realistic expectation would be for a battalion sized element (roughly 650 troops). Pakistan should not be asked to support any helicopter lift requirements, as all assets are required for current GWOT efforts.  4.  (C)  Comment:  Post wishes to add that, in addition to its extensive PKO commitments, Pak mil currently has approximately 35,000 Regular Army troops engaged in security operations against anti-Coalition militants and extremist elements in both North and South Waziristan along the Pak-Afghan border.  (Note:  In addtion to the regular Army forces, another 43,000 Frontier Corps troops are delployed along the border.  End note.)  Applying a general ratio of 3:1 required to sustain operations over the long-haul, the Pak mil commitment to FATA operations requires more than 100,000 troops.  Any PKO contribution that would compromise this commitment should be avoided, thereby raising the prospect that contributions to a Darfur PKO would either come at the expense of Pakistan's current UN PKO commitments or require the GOP to draw from forces deployed on its eastern border with India.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 005978  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2016 TAGS: ECON, PREL, PK SUBJECT: A/S BOUCHER DISCUSSES U.S.-PAKISTAN STRATEGIC DIALOGUE WITH PAKISTAN MFA  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, d.  1.  (C) Summary:  Assistant Secretary Boucher reviewed the status of Strategic Dialogue initiatives and options for structuring the Dialogue in April 4-5 meetings with Foreign Minister Kasuri, Foreign Secretary Khan and Additional Secretary for the Americas Shahid Kamal.   All sides agreed  SIPDIS that the Dialogue marked a major step forward in the bilateral relationship.  The Pakistani side welcomed A/S Boucher's report on work that is already underway, and noted that they have appointed co-chairs for some of the Dialogue topics.  MFA reps did not have strongly held views about how the Dialogue might be structured, but were receptive to proposals offered by A/S Boucher.  End Summary.  2.  (C) In all of A/S Boucher's meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, counterparts praised the Strategic Dialogue as a major advance in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. Foreign Minister Kasuri commented that the inauguration of a Strategic Partnership during President Bush's visit had broadened the bilateral relationship. He welcomed the fact that this would be institutionalized in the Dialogue. Foreign Secretary Riaz Khan alluded to perceived ups and downs in the relationship over the years and said that, in the public eye, the Dialogue would be seen as a welcome sign of a new and more stable friendship.  Initiatives: ------------  3.  (C) A/S Boucher used his Islamabad meetings to review progress already underway under the Dialogue, including energy discussions launched during Energy Secretary Bodman's visit, expansion of the Fulbright program, inauguration of a University Exchange program with Southern Methodist University, and Science and Technology initiatives.  Riaz Khan emphasized the need for "real projects" that would symbolize the deepening bilateral relationship.  4.  (C) Khan said the Bilateral Investment Treaty was with the Prime Minister's Office and there were still several outstanding issues, including liability and jurisdiction.  An internal meeting had been scheduled later in April to review the issues again, he said.  Khan agreed with A/S Boucher that these matters could be addressed in a side letter, rather than the text of the treaty.  5.  (C) A/S Boucher reported that the U.S. is commissioning a study on the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones initiative, in part to lay the groundwork for Congressional approval. Legislation could not be submitted before the fall, he said; in the meantime, the U.S. was looking at product areas, with a view to diversification of exports -- though apparel would be factored in.  He encouraged Pakistan to use the planned April 19 Joint Economic Committee meeting with Afghanistan to discuss ROZ ideas.  6.  (C) Shahid Kamal said that the Pakistani business community is enthusiastic about the proposed Center for Entrepreneurship and noted that the Beyster Institute of UC San Diego had relevant expertise.  Structure ---------  7.  (C) It was clear that the MFA did not have strongly held views about how the Strategic Dialogue should be structured. Riaz Khan was open to the idea of attaching sub-groups to the Dialogue, suggesting that the India-Pakistan Composite Dialogue offered a model, with occasional high-level plenary sessions overseeing reasonably autonomous subgroups.  A/S Boucher agreed that the sub-groups should operate autonomously.  Khan added that Pakistan was very interested in the various economic, educational and scientific areas, but that the Dialogue should also include a forum for discussing political issues, such as Iran, India and nuclear issues.  A/S Boucher agreed, noting that those were good subjects to review in strategic-level discussions, and that in addition Afghanistan and relations with Central Asia should also be included.  ISLAMABAD 00005978  002 OF 002    8. (C) Shahid Kamal reported that Pakistan had agreed to the proposed April 26-27 dates for the inaugural Washington meeting of the Strategic Dialogue.  He informally suggested that subjects might be divided into three baskets, to address bilateral, regional and global issues.  He envisioned that the initial April 26-27 meeting might consist of relatively small delegations and serve as a "curtain raiser" for follow-on subgroup meetings in subsequent weeks.  Pakistan had already identified Dr. Ataur Rahman (Chair of the Higher Education Commission) and Finance Secretary Tanvir Ali Agha as likely Pakistani co-chairs of subgroups.  A/S Boucher proposed that the April 26-27 session begin with a smaller dinner for senior participants on the 26th. This could be followed by an expanded meeting on the 27th that would include subgroup heads, with a full plenary session to follow -- in which participants would be given their marching orders.  Sub-groups would then meet separately and reconvene at the end of the day for a concluding session. Meanwhile, the principals on each side could cover political and strategic topics separately.

UNCLAS ISLAMABAD 005983  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: OVIP, OTRA, BE, PK, AMGT, ASEC SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR GOVERNORS DELEGATION  REF: STATE 54084  1.  Post welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Gov. Mitch Daniels, Gov. Jeb Bush, Gov. Joe Manchin, Gov. Tom Vilsack, Lt. General Blum, Maj. Reale, Ltc. Schroeder, Dan Wilmot, and Anthony Welcher for April 16 and 17.  The purpose of the visit is to transit Pakistan.  2.  Control officer for the visit will be Mohammed Motiwala. He can be reached at the following numbers: Embassy: 92-51-208-0000; Office: 92-51-208-2624; Cell: 0300-501-2202.  3.  The control officer will meet visitors upon arrival at the airport in Islamabad. Please inform control officer of any change in itinerary.  4.   Visitors must/must obtain separate post clearance if they plan to visit any of the three Mission Pakistan consulates (Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore) or any other areas under the jurisdiction of the consulates.  Most travel outside of Islamabad will require separate post clearance. Post clearance for the consulates should be requested via cable to the consulate(s) on the planned itinerary.  5. Unless only transiting Pakistan, everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  6.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  7.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  8.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section, or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  9.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  10.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  11. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services: NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED).  TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.  CROCKER

(C) Summary:  In separate meetings with visiting Assistant Secretary Richard Boucher, Senate Chairman Mohammedmian  SIPDIS Soomro and National Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain confirmed their support for the USAID legislative strengthening project.  Both leaders promised to secure a site for the proposed Institute for Legislative Studies and to support televising proceedings of their Chambers.  They cautioned, however, that other officials were involved and could delay both projects.  When Boucher questioned them on democratic elections, both parliamentary leaders promised free and fair elections in 2007, but were divided as to the prevalence of past election irregularities, with the Speaker giving all previous elections a clean bill of health.  Both leaders expressed strong support for an independent, activist Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), noting that this was already promised in legislation.  Soomro noted that democratization would also require democracy within political parties and urged A/S Boucher to focus on this important area.  The leaders were open to the concept of a broad coalition of moderate forces in advance of the 2007 elections.  End Summary.  Legislative Strengthening Program  2. (C) A/S Boucher opened his meetings with Chairman Soomro and Speaker Hussain by noting the important role that strong legislative institutions must play in a democratic set-up and promised continued support to strengthen parliamentary institutions.  Both leaders responded with thanks for the work that USAID was already doing in this regard.  The Speaker praised the USAID decision to work directly with parliamentary institutions in the current program rather than through NGOs as in the past.  3. (C) A/S Boucher raised our interest in continuing such support through construction of a Pakistan Institute for Legislative Studies (PILS), but cautioned that USG support was contingent on the parliamentary leadership's identification of an appropriate parcel of land and agreement to continue budgetary support.  Both leaders promised ongoing support to the PILS and agreed to work to obtain the necessary parcel of land.  Nothing currently in their possession, however, was considered adequate.  Soomro explained that the process was delayed by the resignation of the Minister of State for Interior who had been handling the issue. While the leadership wanted to obtain land quickly, several government agencies were involved, including the obstructionist Capital Development Authority (CDA).  The Speaker promised to raise the issue with the Prime Minister and have him press for a swift allocation within one or two months.  In the interim, both leaders requested that training for parliamentarians continue using either the Parliamentary Lodges or the old National Assembly building.  4. (C) A/S Boucher raised the important role that televising legislative proceedings could play in raising public awareness of legislatures' performance.  Soomro immediately agreed pronouncing himself "very keen" on the idea. Televised proceedings would provide the public direct access to legislative information, increase accountability, and help voters judge legislator's performance.  Hussain also expressed strong support for televised proceedings and promised that the process was moving forward.  Both cautioned, however, that numerous government agencies were involved in the decision to proceed, making it a complex and lengthy debate.  Soomro cited the Minister of Information as particularly problematic.  Elections  5. (C) A/S Boucher reiterated to both leaders the USG position that free and fair elections must be held in 2007. He pointed out that previous elections did not adequately meet these criteria and that a strong, independent ECP was  ISLAMABAD 00006116  002.2 OF 002   vital to the process.  While both leaders promised that the 2007 contest would be free and fair, the Speaker denied that any fraud had occurred in previous elections.  He argued that those who lost alleged rigging to cover their own deficiencies and that the allegations were baseless.  The ECP was already fully empowered and ensured that no improper activity took place.  6. (C) Soomro had a more realistic view, admitting that violations had occurred in the past and that the ECP would need to be vigilant to prevent them in 2007.  He believed that the ECP powers were sufficiently extensive but argued that a more conducive environment was needed.  In this regard, he argued that it was necessary to change Pakistan's political culture.  Victory in elections was, at present, directly linked to a party's ability to obtain resources and disburse patronage.  As no transparent hiring process existed, civil servants who administered elections were often indebted to a party for their job and would tilt contests in their favor.  Until patronage and money were delinked from election victory, parties would continue to do all they could to violate the rules.  7. (C) Soomro further argued that a lack of internal democracy within political parties contributed to systemic weaknesses.  Parties tended to select candidates and leaders through appointment rather than democratic elections, leading to ongoing internal divisions and personal animosities. Soomro argued that all parties should be required to introduce genuine democracy and suggested that perhaps oversight of internal party contests by the ECP may be necessary.  8. (C) A/S Boucher asked the parliamentary leaders about the possibility of new political party coalitions developing in advance of the 2007 elections.  Both leaders were of the view that shifting alliances were a regular part of Pakistani politics.  Hussain stated that the governing party was prepared to work with any like-minded group, but that cooperation would depend on the conduct of the opposition parties.  In the current, polarized environment, he did not believe that differences could be easily overcome.  Anti-Money Laundering Law  9. (C) A/S Boucher pressed Speaker Hussain to seek the release of the GOP's Anti-Money Laundering Law from the Finance Committee.  The Speaker made no comment and rapidly switched the subject to thank the USG for its assistance in earthquake relief.  10. (U) Assistant Secretary Boucher has cleared this message. CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 006117  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2016 TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PK SUBJECT: A/S BOUCHER MEETING WITH CHIEF ELECTION COMMISSIONER   ISLAMABAD 00006117  001.2 OF 002   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b.  1. (C) Summary:  In his first meeting with A/S Boucher, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Qazi Mohammad Farooq stressed his commitment to holding a free and fair election in 2007. A/S Bouhcer pledged our continued support and stressed the importance of the commission's independence as vital to successful elections.  Farooq expressed strong appreciation for US Government assistance in this regard, welcoming USAID's focus on voter roles, training, and ballot boxes. Farooq promised that he would engage with political parties to rebuild the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) credibility and resolve electoral issues.  Farooq noted that the greatest challenge to free and fair elections was a lack of political will, noting that if this existed the ECP had extensive powers.  Farooq stressed that international observation of the electoral process was absolutely essential and that the ECP would unilaterally invite observers.  End Summary.  A Free, Fair, and Transparent Election  2. (C) A/S Boucher stressed to newly-appointed CEC Farooq that the US Government would support free and fair elections in 2007.  The independence of the ECP was absolutely vital. Farooq agreed that the ECP was critical to the free and fair election that he was committed to organizing in 2007.  Farooq noted that a lack of political will on the part of his predecessors was the principal obstacle to a free and fair contest.  While numerous players would try to interfere in 2007, the ECP would evolve mechanisms to make such interference far more difficult and costly.  With a clear legal framework now in place, the ECP can keep most violations at bay by utilizing its existing powers and authorities.  Farooq noted that the ECP was largely independent with control over its finances, staffing structure, and hiring processes.  Farooq promised that he would avoid the mistakes of his predecessors, including last minute changes to laws, polling operations, and polling places that had essentially served as a form of rigging.  Voter Roles  3.  (C) When A/S Boucher inquired about the difficulties ahead, Farooq stressed that his initial challenge would be the creation of accurate electoral roles.  These were "the essence of free and fair elections."  At least half of all complaints emanated directly from the improperly prepared voter roles currently in use.  Computerization would increase public access to these vital documents and ensure that future updates can be more easily carried out.  Asked about the process to be used in preparing the new lists, Farooq stated that he would scrupulously adhere to the procedures laid out in the law, including door-to-door verification and a period for public review and challenges.  Farooq noted that while the ECP would certainly use data in the National Identification Card and census databases as a cross-check, an independent survey conducted by ECP staff was the only way to ensure accuracy and impartiality.  Engagement with Political Parties  4. (C) A/S Boucher underscored the importance of regular engagement between the CEC and the heads of political parties.  This would enable the ECP to address their numerous complaints about past elections and enable agreement on steps that can prevent violations in future.  The CEC agreed that consultation was essential.  He promised to deal with all parties on an equal basis and to address their outstanding concerns.  He concurred that mutual agreement on processes was important to build the credibility of the ECP and welcomed USG assistance in creating an on-going forum. Farooq cautioned, however, that at present the parties were engaged in significant discussions with each other and would not be prepared to engage him or the ECP for at least a few  ISLAMABAD 00006117  002.2 OF 002   more weeks.  International Observation  5. (C) A/S Boucher queried Justice Farooq on his views about international observation.  Farooq responded that he considered it an integral part of any free and fair election process.  He said that sampling efforts would need to be expanded in the 2007 elections.  Observation in all districts of the country would be essential.  The ECP would unilaterally invite international observation of the process.  Farooq was unconcerned about any political fallout, noting that Pakistan had a long history of observation and that the decision rested solely with the ECP.  Administrative Challenges  6. (C) Farooq highlighted for A/S Boucher a number of other administrative challenges for the 2007 polls.  The CEC praised USG assistance on transparent ballot boxes, noting that this will help to minimize allegations of rigging. Similarly, the CEC reiterated the need for training of both ECP polling staff and voters.  He pointed out that strengthening the ECP's own academy was a useful starting point.  While UNDP has promised some assistance, additional support was needed.  (Note: UNDP Islamabad does not/not yet have approved funding for this project.  End Note.)  Asked by A/S Boucher about electoral conditions in the FATA and earthquake zones, Farooq was relatively confident that any challenges could be successfully addressed over the next year.  He was more concerned about parts of Balochistan, where deteriorating security conditions might force the ECP to delay polls.  7. (U) Assistant Secretary Boucher has cleared this message. CROCKER

(U) In an April 5 address at Columbia University, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz reiterated Pakistan's call for a "package deal" on civil nuclear cooperation involving both India and Pakistan and noted that Pakistan had sought a "strategic restraint regime" to prevent an arms race and stabilize the strategic postures of the two countries.  When asked on April 8 about Secretary Rice's mention of non-proliferation in her Senate testimony, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tasneem Aslam noted "Pakistan has already made a proposal on a strategic restraint regime in South Asia. These things can be discussed in the context of our proposals."  2.  (C) On April 10, MFA Director for Disarmament Khalid Mehmood briefed PolCouns on Pakistan's proposal for a strategic restraint regime (SRR).  The proposal had its origins in Pakistani ideas that had been floated with the Indians in the 1990s, before the Indo-Pak dialogue stalled (in 1998).  (Prior to the two countries' nuclear tests, he said, Pakistan had called for a nuclear free zone in South Asia, combined with a "no-war pact.")  In 2004, Pakistan tabled a modified SRR proposal that included the following elements: (a) no operational deployment of nuclear-capable missiles, (b) keeping nuclear weapons on low alert status (i.e., warheads to be kept separate from delivery vehicles), (c) avoiding an arms race, and (d) no acquisition or deployment of destabilizing systems like anti-ballistic missile systems.  3.  (C) According to Mehmood, the Indian side had rejected the proposal, saying that its security concerns transcended South Asia. Pakistan's view, he said, was that extra-regional considerations should not exclude the prospect of strategic restraint within the region, especially given that the preponderance of India's conventional forces appeared to be arrayed towards Pakistan. Pakistan remained concerned about the threat of an accidental or unauthorized nuclear incident, he added.  4.  (C) Mehmood noted that although the SRR is not moving forward, Pakistan and India now have a pre-notification agreement on ballistic missile tests.  Pakistan hoped to extend the agreement to cruise missile tests, he said, explaining that cruise missiles could also carry nuclear payloads, but India had not responded favorably as yet. These discussions were ongoing in two experts groups under the Composite Dialogue, one dealing with conventional CBMs and the other with nuclear CBMs.  The groups had met three times, most recently in August 2005, and were next scheduled to meet April 25-27, with the first two days devoted to nuclear CBMs and the last day to conventional.  5.  (C) Asked why Aslam and Aziz were raising the SRR concept in the context of the debate over the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative, Mehmood speculated that Pakistan hoped to underscore that it was a responsible nuclear power, and thus a candidate for a similar civil-nuclear deal.  6.  (C) Comment:  We suspect that much of the noise Pakistani officials are making regarding the U.S.-India civ-nuc deal is playing to a domestic audience.  Raising the SRR at this time is probably not due to any calculation that Pakistan has a realistic prospect of participating in a "package" civ-nuc deal with India.  It is more likely that with the eyes of the world (and Congress) on India, Pakistan senses that it has more leverage to prod India for a response to their SRR proposal.  Pakistan may also have an eye on the April 25-26 Pak-India session on Nuclear CBMs.     CROCKER

(C)  Summary:  Although there have been no major breakthroughs since the opening meetings of the third round of Composite Dialogue talks in January, delegations from India and Pakistan have been busy working on a variety of issues.  The frequency of these high-level meetings suggests that Pakistan remains committed to moving forward despite frequent official complaints that India is not permitting reciprocal progress on the "core" issue of Kashmir.  Media reports of expert-level consultations and incremental progress on a variety of practical issues have become a regular feature of Pakistani newspapers over the past month. End summary.  2.  (U) Since the third round of the India-Pakistan Composite Dialogue Process in New Delhi in January (reftel), Indian and Pakistani delegations have engaged in several technical-level and Joint Working Group meetings:  -- Technical-level meeting with civil aviation authorities (March 6-7, New Delhi)  -- Joint Commission Working Groups on the Environment and Science and Technology (March 21-22, Islamabad)  -- Technical-level meeting between the Central Bureau of Investigation (India) and the Federal Investigation Agency (Pakistan) (March 21-22, New Delhi)  -- Joint Working Group on Economic and Commercial Cooperation (March 28-29, Islamabad)  3.  (U) The Central Bureau of Investigation of India (CBI) and Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), met March 21-22 in New Delhi, their first meeting in seventeen years. Both agreed to explore opportunities in professional training and cooperation in combating human trafficking, counterfeit currency and illegal immigration.  The director of CBI accepted FIA's invitation to visit Islamabad later this year to continue discussions.  4.  (U) In Islamabad on March 28-29, the Joint Working Group on Economic and Commercial Cooperation agreed to move forward on bilateral transportation, trade, communication and investment.  Both sides indicated they are ready to sign a shipping agreement, with a target date in July.  The Indian and Pakistani commerce secretaries also agreed to jointly register basmati rice, which could facilitate issuance of a geographic patent restricting the "basmati" designation to rice grown in India and Pakistan.  The delegations also agreed to expedite the process of opening state bank branches in each country -- a commitment long stalled -- and to ease visa requirements for businessmen and tourists.  To meet Pakistan's tea shortage, both parties encouraged exchange visits of tea import/export delegations to discuss opening the Pakistani market to Indian tea sellers.  In the joint statement, both sides listed steps to reach agreement in future meetings, including:  -- An Indian promise to provide detailed proposals on IT-enabled medical services and export insurance cooperation;  -- A meeting of transportation experts at the Attari-Wagah border to discuss upgrading infrastructure and to facilitate the export of transit cargo to Afghanistan;  -- Indian assurances to complete the installation of a fiber optic line on the Indian side of the border to link with the line that has been installed on the Pakistani side;  (Note: This would be particularly helpful after the large economic losses caused by the break in Pakistan's sole high-speed data line last fall.  End note.)   ISLAMABAD 00006242  002.2 OF 002   -- An Indian request that Pakistan allow the import of 286 more Indian products into Pakistan, which Pakistan agreed to consider;  -- A Pakistani announcement that it had ratified the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), making tariff benefits available to all member countries, including India.  5.  (U) Six more meetings are scheduled to complete the third round of the Composite Dialogue talks:  -- April 18-19, Islamabad - Tulbul Navigation Project/Wullar Barrage  -- May 23-24, New Delhi - Siachen  -- May 25-26, New Delhi - Sir Creek  -- May 30-13, Islamabad - Terrorism and Drug Trafficking  -- June 1-2, New Delhi - Promotion of Friendly Exchanges  -- July 20-21, New Delhi - Foreign Secretary and Foreign Minister-level Review Meeting  -- July 22, New Delhi - Plenary Session of the Joint Commission  6.  (C) Comment.  The frequency of the meetings highlights Pakistan's commitment to the Composite Dialogue process. Thorough Pakistani press coverage of the Dialogue also signals that the media (and their readers) are interested in the outcomes of these meetings -- there was extensive coverage of the Joint Working Group on Economic and Commercial Cooperation.  Pakistani officials continue to complain that India is not permitting reciprocal progress on the "core" issue of Kashmir, but for now this has not prompted Pakistan to stall progress in other areas of the Dialogue.  GOP MFA officials have also emphasized the need to lock in progress in the Composite Dialogue to shield these positive developments from any downturn in relations.  End comment.  CROCKER 
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 006419  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2016 TAGS: MNUC, PREL, MARR, PK, AF, IN, PGOV, IR SUBJECT: PRIME MINISTER AZIZ BRIEFS SENATOR HAGEL ON PAKISTAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ISSUES.  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) Summary:  In a wide-ranging conversation with visiting Senator Hagel (R-NE), Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz reiterated Pakistan's opposition to any nuclear weapons program in Iran, but supported Iran's right to a civil nuclear energy program.  He praised Afghan President Karzai, and highlighted Pakistan's security efforts in its restive tribal areas. On peace discussions with India, he said Pakistan hoped for accelerated progress on Kashmir.  Pakistan was concerned that the civ-nuc deal with India would give India the capability to produce 100-400 additional warheads per year.  The deal would have been improved, Aziz said, had it been combined with a Pakistan-India nuclear restraint regime.  Aziz reported that Pakistan had prepared a Letter of Request (LOR) for 18 C and D block F-16s and 30 A and B block.  Later, Pakistan might ask for an additional 18 C and D block F-16s.  He defended the government's performance in promoting the economy and moving the country toward democracy.  He stressed that Pakistan was making strides toward democracy and said that on this score many in the Cabinet deeply resented the "condescending statements" of visiting dignitaries.  End Summary.  2.  (C) In an April 12 meeting with visiting Senator Chuck Hagel, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz offered a tour de horizon of Pakistan's foreign and domestic policy concerns.  Aziz explained that his comments were "hot off the press," reflecting discussions held that day in (a) an unusually substantive cabinet meeting dealing with national and security issues, and (b) a meeting of Pakistan's National Command Authority (chaired by President Musharraf and including Aziz, the Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military Section chiefs).  The latter meeting, he said, had also included scientists and had focused on nuclear issues. Senator Hagel reported on his discussions in India over previous days.  He offered his sympathies in the wake of the deadly bombing at a Karachi religious festival, underscoring that he was a strong supporter of Pakistan and that Pakistan had a lot of friends in Congress.  Iran ----  3.  (C) Aziz said that Pakistani scientists at the NCA meeting, viewed Iran's announcement on uranium enrichment was "nothing  new."  In their judgment, Iran was "re-declaring" a capability it already had.  Pakistan had been clear that Iran must not produce nuclear weapons under any circumstances, Aziz continued, but Iran was entitled to a civil nuclear program under IAEA safeguards.  The international community should use diplomacy much more rigorously; "anything short of military action."  Aziz also sought to distinguish Pakistan's program from Iran's, saying that Pakistan had pursued its program only in response to India's, and had done so in order to preserve balance and regional stability.  Afghanistan -----------  4.  (C) Pakistan is interested in a "strong, stable, vibrant Afghanistan," Aziz asserted.  Violence and instability in Afghanistan would be destabilizing to the entire region.  For that reason, Pakistan had taken very significant steps in the border region, Aziz noted, adding that he had asked Secretary Rumsfeld for additional USG help.  Pakistan had sent the army into the tribal areas for the first time in history in order to deny the Taliban a sanctuary -- a move that had led to resistance from the local population.  Pakistan did not need to be "preached at" on this score; it was pursuing terrorists out of conviction.  However, it took "two to tango" and Afghanistan needed to do more on its side of the border. Pakistan had "clear evidence" that anti-Pakistan elements were filtering in from across the border and from Afghan refugee camps.  5.  (C) Despite the "snafu" over the "obsolete" intelligence information passed to Pakistan by President Karzai, Aziz said he was convinced that Karzai was well meaning.  Pakistan would support him "two hundred percent."  Aziz noted that Pakistani representatives at the recent trilateral U.S.-Afghan-Pakistan intelligence meeting in Bagram had  ISLAMABAD 00006419  002 OF 003   returned pleased, though there was a lingering "trust deficit" between the sides.  India -----  6.  (C) Pakistan was continuing to press forward on peace efforts with India, Aziz said, adding that there might be a window of opportunity on a couple issues.  However, there was a need for progress on the core issues relating to Jammu and Kashmir, especially steps toward demilitarizing the area. India acknowledged that the level of infiltration had declined; international relief workers had been given free reign in Azad Kashmir and no "camps" were visible.  (Note: presumably a reference to militant camps.)  The Indian side needed to match President Musharraf's "passion" for progress on the issue.  This was a defining moment, and Pakistan was open-minded on possible solutions.  Civil-Nuclear Initiative ------------------------  7. (C) Aziz focused on two points relating to the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative.  First, it would have been better if any deal affecting nuclear capabilities had been combined with a nuclear restraint regime that covered both countries. The restraint regime had been the subject of a long conversation in the NCA meeting, Aziz added.  Second, the deal as currently structured would allow India to produce more fissile material, which would lead to more warheads, creating a strategic imbalance.   Aziz reported that Pakistani experts estimated that this new ability to substitute imported fuel for use in safeguarded civil reactors would free up fuel for the production of 100-400 extra warheads per year.  He said Pakistan understood Washington's desire to engage India on the issue, but if it affected Pakistan's security, Pakistan would have to respond.  Pakistan would "have to do whatever it has to do" to maintain regional stability.  8.  (C) Aziz noted that Pakistan also had very significant civil nuclear energy needs, and projected that it would require 8800 MGW of nuclear power by 2030.  Pakistan understood that it was in the "doldrums" due to AQ Khan's misdeeds, but its needs were real and it would have to identify alternative sources.  Pakistan had been burned by Khan, Aziz added.  Khan had not even been a scientist, but rather an engineer and entrepreneur -- and now he was "in the doghouse."  9.  (C) Senator Hagel responded that Congress was looking closely at the civil nuclear initiative with India, with particular attention to "the IAEA piece." Congress would want to understand the India-specific safeguards protocol with the IAEA.  In his view, taken as a whole, the agreement was in the interests of both Pakistan and India.  It should not be seen as directed against other countries in the region, whether India or China.  Hagel said he expected the agreement would ultimately be ratified, but there were uncertainties.  Law and Order and Security --------------------------  10.  (C) Pakistan is strongly opposed to terrorism, Aziz said.  "There is no good terrorist."  Alluding to the April 12 bombing in Karachi, he explained that law and order was a provincial responsibility and he planned to travel to Karachi the next day to look into the situation.  However, the investigation into the bombing was proceeding well.  11.  (C) Aziz reported that Pakistan had prepared the Letter of Request (LOR) for U.S. aircraft and "targeting equipment."  This would include a request for 18 F--16 C and D block aircraft, with the prospect of purchasing another 18 later. In addition, Pakistan would request 30 F--16 A and B block aircraft.  At the same time, Pakistan was awaiting a contract for a purchase of Chinese aircraft.  Pakistan's overall doctrine was "minimum credible deterrence," Aziz explained. In fact it had considerably paired down its request due to the earthquake.  Economy -------  ISLAMABAD 00006419  003 OF 003    12.  (C) Aziz defended the government's handling of the economy over recent years, saying the middle class was expanding as Pakistan retained high growth rates (the second highest in the world last year).  Inflation was under control, reserves had increased, foreign direct investment had hit a new high of $3 billion last year, and there were a lot of important projects still in the pipeline. Unemployment had declined, but further progress would require steps to improve skill levels among workers.  Aziz added that Pakistan's economic agenda was focused on deregulation, market economics and privatization of state assets.  Pakistan had recently sold a state-owned steel mill and half of its banks were owned by foreigners.  Democracy ---------  13.  (C) "We are neither apologetic nor defensive" about the progress of democracy in Pakistan, Aziz asserted.  Pakistan had a very active political scene, with vociferous opposition parties.  The governing coalition had only 200 of the 342 seats in the parliament.  Leaders of some of the opposition parties were now out of the country only because they were "up to their necks" in activities that would land them in jail in any civilized country.   The press was more of a force than at any time in Pakistan's history, and there had been a proliferation of electronic media outlets.  For much of Pakistan's history offending journalists would be locked up.  In contrast, President Musharraf took pride in the independent media.  Pakistan also had a "new, tough, Independent Election Commissioner."  In selecting the Commissioner, the government had asked the opposition parties to give their views.  Some had; some hadn't.  14.  (C) Pakistan needed no lessons on democracy, Aziz concluded.  It believed in freedom of expression and the power of the ballot box, but that did not mean it would permit corruption to flourish again.  On this score, even opposition figures privately credited Musharraf, who was widely seen as clean.   Aziz admitted that Pakistan had "some issues," including a President that also held another office.  That arrangement had been dictated by circumstances and it would expire.  For the first time, an elected parliament would serve its full term -- until November 2007 -- Aziz observed.  He noted that during the cabinet meeting, his colleagues had expressed resentment at "condescending statements" made by friends and visitors about democracy in Pakistan.  15.  (U) Senator Hagel has cleared this message. CROCKER 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 006420  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2016 TAGS: MNUC, PTER, PGOV, PREL, PK, AF, IN SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF EXPRESSES CONCERN TO SENATOR HAGEL ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (S) Summary:  President Musharraf reviewed with visiting Senator Hagel his concerns over his relationship with the U.S., citing the U.S.-India Civil-Nuclear Initiative and perceived pressure for democratization.  He also described the threat of Talibanization in Pakistan's Tribal Areas.  He worried that the Civil Nuclear Initiative implicitly recognized India as a nuclear state and could reignite an arms race in South Asia.  He urged that the U.S. support construction of a new fully safeguarded nuclear power plant for Pakistan, arguing that it would not give Pakistan any technology or fuel it did already have and that he would much rather get assistance from the U.S. than from other countries; this would help correct perceptions that a rift had developed between the two countries.  Similarly, Musharraf expressed concern about a growing perception that there was a rift between him and the United States on democratization.  He was moving the country steadily toward democracy, he said, but there was a perception that he was doing this only because he had been put in a corner. Musharraf reported that while the Al Qa'ida presence in the Tribal Areas was declining, "Talibanization" was increasing and spreading into neighboring districts of Pakistan. He reviewed a four-part strategy of military, political, administrative and development measures to counter the trend.  Musharraf stressed that success would depend on complementary efforts on the Afghan side of the border and complained that India was sowing distrust by spreading misinformation in Afghanistan.  End Summary.  2.  (C) President Musharraf met with visiting Senator Chuck Hagel on April 13, using the opportunity to convey his views on the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear initiative, democracy and Pakistani steps to address the threat of "Talibanization" in the Tribal Areas.  Senator Hagel opened the meeting by stressing the importance of the U.S. relationship with Pakistan and the need to work together in confronting mutual challenges.   The United States appreciated Pakistan's efforts in the border area, he said, and understood that the success of mutual efforts in the region rested on the strength of the bilateral relationship.  Nuclear Power -------------  3.  (S) Musharraf reported that he had chaired a meeting of Pakistan's National Command Authority (NCA) the previous day and that perceptions of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear initiative were not good.  These negative perceptions reflected widely held views in the society as a whole.  "We understand your geostrategic relationship with India," he said, but in Pakistan the deal was "vastly unpopular" for two reasons.  First, it implicitly accepted India as a nuclear state while excluding Pakistan, so Pakistanis felt "singled out."  Secondly, it would increase India's ability to proliferate because India's weaponization efforts had been constrained by a shortage of nuclear fuel, which would no longer exist under the Initiative.  This was the unanimous perception of the members of the NCA.  Pakistan would now be grappling with the prospect of a nuclear arms race with India because it would never allow its nuclear deterrent capability to be compromised.  4.  (S) Musharraf added that he also did not understand why the United States could not let Pakistan have a 1000 MGW civil nuclear reactor.  Pakistan did not need more fuel for the reactor, so it would not lead to proliferation. Moreover, it would not involve any technology that Pakistan did not already possess.  Pakistan's nuclear capabilities were already far more advanced than India's.  Pakistan would welcome any kind of safeguards regime over the plant, Musharraf continued.  Finally, Pakistan had very real energy needs that would have to be addressed one way or another. Currently, China was providing a reactor, and Pakistan would need more.  That was the reality and Pakistan would have to move forward, whether with the United States or not.  5.   (S) Musharraf stressed that he would far rather move forward with the United States, but the Administration's current posture precluded that.  He cherished his friendship with President Bush and he had said so both publicly and  ISLAMABAD 00006420  002 OF 003   privately: "I say he is a friend. He is sincere and open. These are things you appreciate.  And we are together in fighting terror."  Unfortunately, the media created the impression that a rift had developed in the wake of the President's visit to Pakistan.  This perception was a greater concern than actual nuclear capabilities.  "We know our capabilities and our potential," Musharraf stressed, Pakistan would get the reactor anyway.  So the only result of the current policy would be to deepen the perception that there were problems between the two countries.  Despite Pakistan's willingness to submit to safeguards, everything would be given to India and Pakistan was being singled out.  6.  (C) In response, Senator Hagel indicated that while he supported strengthening the U.S.-India relationship, he also agreed that the United States had not given enough attention to Pakistan.  The U.S.-India relationship needed to be seen in the context of wider U.S. relationships in the region.  It should not have the effect of intimidating or isolating Pakistan or China or other countries in the region. Bilateral initiatives should be framed in a regional context.  Hagel said he expected Congress would ultimately pass the U.S.-India agreement, but many uncertainties remained.  Hagel added that Congress would probably want to assess the IAEA protocol with India before passing the agreement.  Democracy ---------  7.  (C) Musharraf worried that this perception of a rift between the United States and him was reinforced "when people come and overdo the issue of democracy."  He acknowledged that his being in uniform was undemocratic, but added, "we have never had democracy in Pakistan."  In contrast, he had "empowered people, women, minorities and the grass roots." He had freed the media and enabled the parliament to complete its full tenure and hold a second election for the first time in Pakistan's history.  He was totally in favor of democracy, and a great deal had been achieved, so people should be careful about statements in the press.  8.  (C) Musharraf cited an editorial that morning asserting that recent USG comments on democracy were evidence that the US was moving away from him.  "Yes, I agree," he said, "we should have democracy" but he also deserved credit for what he had achieved in that direction.  Pakistan would have "free and fair elections," but there was a perception that he was being forced into it.  As in the case of broader U.S. relations with the region, the idea was taking hold that Pakistan was being singled out for pressure.  India was being treated differently -- "as a partner."  Ever since the President's visit, there was a growing perception that his own personal standing had declined.  Talibanization --------------  9.  (S) Musharraf observed that in his view there had been a significant change in the Tribal Areas.  Pakistani forces continued to go after Al Qa'ida elements "whenever we get word."  "We strike fast," he said, adding that there had been a very successful strike the previous night.  However, in his assessment, Al Qa'ida was greatly weakened and the Taliban was stepping into the vacuum.  Now Talibanization was the issue, and it was a phenomenon on both sides of the Afghan border.  It was characterized by "obscurantist views" including sanctions for barbers who shaved men's beards, and opposition to music and television.  These Taliban elements were spreading through the Tribal Areas and into outside districts of Pakistan.  10.  (C) Musharraf noted that one obstacle he faced was a religious government in the NWFP that turned a blind eye to Talibanization.  Moreover, because the Chief Minister was with the opposition MMA, he had to work through the governor.  He said he was "reasonably sure" the situation would be remedied in the next election because the MMA would be "wiped out."  He was confident the government would ultimately succeed in countering Talibanization because only a small minority of the population shared the Taliban's extreme views (albeit a dominant minority).  Pakistan was addressing the challenge of Talibanization with a four-pronged strategy, he  ISLAMABAD 00006420  003 OF 003   explained:  -- First, it was continuing military actions against terrorists and any Taliban clerics that were trying to run a government within a government, for example by requiring men to wear beards.  -- Second, on the political side, Pakistan was opening up the Tribal Areas to "progressive political forces."  Without putting anything in writing, he had given tacit permission to these political parties to "go in and do political work."  --Third, he was working to correct the "administrative set-up."  Currently the FATA Secretariat (which represents the Tribal Areas and reports to the Chief Minister of the Northwest Frontier Province) was "impotent." Moreover, the seven Political Agents (one for each Agency), who were supposed to be powerful and whose word used to be law, were not effective.  The government wanted to get the best people for the job, whether out of the military or the bureaucracy, and equip them effective security forces (tribal levies). This would give Political Agents independent authority so they would not have to fall back on the army or Frontier Corps.  Musharraf noted that one-time NWFP Chief Minister Sahibzada Imtiaz Ahmad was preparing a study on how to "reactivate" the Political Agents.  -- Fourth, efforts were already underway to end the physical and economic isolation of the tribal areas by building infrastructure (including roads and irrigation systems), generating jobs and building schools.  A "massive" construction effort was in the works; Pakistan had asked for $150 million per year in donor assistance, and would more than match that amount out of its own resources.  U.S.-backed "Reconstruction Opportunity Zones" (ROZs) also had great potential to create jobs and economic opportunity.  11.  (S) Musharraf said he hoped there would be equal efforts on the Afghan side of the border and complained that a perception had been created that Pakistan's government and its intelligence services were pursuing separate agendas.  It was a perception he found "most annoying" and one that the Indian intelligence service was spreading in Afghanistan. Musharraf said he had documentary evidence that India was working through Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense and its intelligence service to undermine Afghan perceptions of Pakistan; he had shown the evidence to President Bush during the President's visit to Pakistan.  India was also providing support and cash to "feudal tribals" who were making trouble in Balochistan.  12.  (U) Codel did not have an opportunity to clear this cable. CROCKER

He argued that "transparent mechanisms" now governing Pakistan's nuclear program would prevent the kinds of abuses associated with AQ Khan.  Kasuri admitted that the India civ-nuc deal had been briefed to Pakistan in advance.  On relations with India, Kasuri reported that "no major differences" remained on Siachen and Sir Creek; Indian PM Singh was expected to visit between July and September, and he expected an agreement would be reached by then.   He urged the U.S. to engage in a dialogue with Iran, warning that a military attack would be a disaster for Pakistan. As a perceived U.S. "stooge," an attack would embarrass Pakistan in the Muslim world -- and it would inflame sectarian tensions.  Kasuri maintained that Iran's enrichment announcement was a publicity stunt and now that the Iranians had "declared victory," it created an opportunity to "humor them" and convince them to go no further.   End Summary.  2.  (U) Foreign Minister Kasuri briefed visiting Senator Hagel (R-NE) on April 13 on Pakistan's perspective on nuclear issues, India and Iran.  Kasuri had participated in a preceding meeting with President Musharraf (septel) and used the opportunity to reinforce points made by Musharraf.  Nuclear Power -------------  3.  (S) Kasuri began by questioning the Civil Nuclear Initiative's exclusive focus on India.  Pakistan didn't understand U.S. motives or why it was in U.S. interests to entirely rule out transfers to Pakistan relating to its civilian nuclear power needs.  Pakistan would have to do whatever it had to do; any government would act similarly. The only consequence, from an American point of view, he said, was that Pakistan would have to buy from someone else, "of course, under IAEA safeguards."  Why was it in the U.S. interest to let the Chinese or some other country garner that goodwill?  4.  (S) Nor did Kasuri understand the focus on AQ Khan.  Khan had operated with virtually no oversight.  There had been suspicions that he was living beyond his means, but the prevailing assumption had been that he was "skimming" from program funds.  The reality (that he was selling technology) didn't emerge because Khan had been given considerable autonomy in the days when Pakistan's program was covert.  He could order pickups and deliveries of shipments without anyone asking questions.  Kasuri said that Musharraf told him that before 1998 the program was strictly on a need to know basis, and even Musharraf, who was Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) at the time was unaware of operational details. That had changed when Pakistan declared its program in 1998, and Pakistan had moved to "transparent mechanisms."   Kasuri argued that Khan was a lone proliferator, explaining that of the many areas that could have been affected, proliferation only occurred in those areas under Khan's authority.  Khan was currently under house arrest, Kasuri added.  5.  (C) Kasuri was clear that Pakistan had not been misled on the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative.  "We were told about the deal in advance," he said, however one factor that had changed was that Pakistan was now realizing that its own need for nuclear energy was much higher than it had previously estimated.  6.  (C) Pakistan shared U.S. anti-proliferation goals, Kasuri said.  It did not want nuclear weapons capabilities to spread: "we are the only Moslem country and don't want anyone else to get it."  7.  (C) Senator Hagel noted that he did not speak for the Administration or Congress, but that to his knowledge no one was blaming President Musharraf for the AQ Khan business. Nonetheless, Pakistan should not underestimate the damage Khan had done.  There was a deep perception in Congress that Pakistan had behaved irresponsibly and could not be trusted,  ISLAMABAD 00006647  002 OF 003   and that perception would be difficult to overcome.   Hagel also emphasized that it was important that the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Initiative not be seen as marginalizing the relationship with Pakistan, which was "a really indispensable relationship."  India -----  8.  (C) Kasuri commented that many of Pakistan's problems were linked to relations with India, so it was very significant that relations were improving and that both sides were using a new vocabulary on Kashmir.  Pakistan, in fact was now doing an about face, having recognized that its decades-long focus on international legality had not achieved anything.   Kasuri cited former Indian National Security Advisor Dixit's statement that the sides needed to think out of the box.  Prime Minister Singh, in his recent Amritsar speech had actually used Musharraf's language when he called for "pragmatic and practical" solutions.  The difference was that Musharraf had begun to explain what he means.  "It looks like the sides are getting closer," Kasuri concluded, adding that Pakistan welcomed President Bush's mention of the Kashmir issue in Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad.  9.  (C) Kasuri noted that the two sides had come a long way, "but have resolved nothing."  He remained hopeful, saying with regard to the Siachen and Sir Creek disputes, "I have a feeling we can resolve these."  Prime Minister Singh would likely visit Pakistan between July and September, and he expected there would be an agreement on Siachen and Sir Creek by then; "if not, it would be a major disappointment" because "we have no major differences." It was important, Kasuri added, that after all these years there should be some definitive progress, however limited.  Iran ----  10.  (C) Kasuri characterized Iran's enrichment announcement as "ridiculous."  Iran's nuclear program was launched under the Shah -- well before Pakistan's -- and their enrichment capabilities were "not a new thing."   The announcement had simply been a "PR stunt," and might be the end of the story if the Iranians received appropriate attention.  Kasuri advised that the U.S. "engage with them."  Iran had already declared a victory; the United States should "humor them" while ensuring that they go no further  11.  (C) The nuclear program transcended political divisions within Iran, Kasuri said.  Former Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi had told him that there were no differences on this issue, regardless of the government in power.  It was a matter of national pride:  "the Indians, the Israelis, the Europeans, the Chinese, the Russians -- all these countries had it."  12.  (C) Kasuri reiterated that Pakistan shared the U.S. interest in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. President Musharraf had told Secretary Rice that he did not want Iran to acquire such a capability.  But the only way out was through dialogue.  Kasuri reported that during a visit to Pakistan, Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, had asked Kasuri to talk to the Americans. Kasuri had said he would do so on one condition, that Iran's program had to be independently verifiable.  13. (C) "We dread military action," Kasuri continued. Pakistan's nightmare scenario would be a U.S. attack, because Pakistan was seen as an American "stooge" and would be targeted by Iran for destabilizing activities -- along with Iraq and Afghanistan.  A military attack would be Pakistan's "worst nightmare, an ultimate disaster."  Apart from the threat to political stability, the effect on oil prices could be catastrophic for Pakistan.  "Don't scare the American people into feeling that America has to react militarily," he concluded, "instead, engage them.  This is nothing new."  April 11 Karachi Bombing ------------------------   ISLAMABAD 00006647  003 OF 003   14.  (C) Kasuri noted that one reason Pakistan dreads any military action against Iran is that Shias are am important domestic constituency, accounting for 10-15 percent of the population.  The recent attack in Karachi illustrated a dangerous recent trend in sectarian violence.  There had been sectarian tension for 200 years, but of a different kind. The current strain of violence dated from the mid 1980s.  An attack on Iran would be widely viewed in Pakistan as "yet another American attack on an Islamic country," but the reaction would be particularly violent among Shias.  "And we are on Iran's border," Kasuri added.  15.  (C) Although the victims of the Karachi bombing were virtually all Sunnis, Kasuri said he didn't think Iran was behind the attack.  He speculated that the perpetrators could have been from an extremist Sunni group opposed to the brand of "soft, Sufi Islam" espoused by the victims.  Kasuri explained that the Sunni Tehrik group, whose leadership was decimated in the attack, had been "brought to combat the influence of outsiders" and to "reestablish the South Asian identity" of Islam in Pakistan.  16.

(C//NF) The FATA is divided into seven administrative territories, or "Agencies": Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Khurram, North Waziristan and South Waziristan.  As a region, it lies outside of the elected, legal, and administrative bounds that govern each of the four provinces of Pakistan. Technically a federal territory, it is supposed to be governed by the Federal Ministry for States and Frontiers (SAFRON). The SAFRON Ministry's charter charges it with directing all federal interaction with the FATA, asserting administrative and political control, and overseeing development plans and policy directives. In reality, chronic indifference and a lack of control at the SAFRON ministry has resulted in the shift of FATA responsibilities to a labyrinth of federal, provincial (NWFP) and local actors that seek to assert influence over FATA; none has effective or complete control.  4. (C//NF) Provincially, the FATA is currently administered by the NWFP Governor and his "FATA Secretariat". The NWFP Governor has the power to oversee all administrative, legal, and economic decisions made for FATA.  In 2002, former NWFP Governor Ifthikar Shah established the FATA Secretariat to consolidate the political and development functions disbursed through several provincial cabinet ministries. It was also created as a follow-on to the now defunct FATA development cooperation, which was seen as corrupt and inefficient. When Governor Khalilur Rehman took office in March 2005, he strengthened the administrative powers of the FATA Secretariat, envisioning it as a place to coordinate and  SIPDIS implement long-term development plans, and ensure accountability in the Political Agents' running of each Agency. Governor Rehman announced that his goal was to break the control of drug mafias, warlords and what he referred to in 2004 as the "stranglehold" of the mullahs by improving educational opportunities, increasing funding for development, winning over warlords, and eliminating FATA,s isolation. Actual implementation of this plan has been faulty, as the Governor's control has been weak, and the Secretariat has been mired in bureaucracy and in all  SIPDIS likelihood, corruption.  5. (U) Administrative and judicial powers are carried out by a mid-level bureaucrat from the GOP's District Management group, the Political Agent (PA), and several Deputy PAs. Under the administrative system created by the British colonial government, each PA was appointed federally and approved by the NWFP governor. His key role was to ensure tribal loyalty to the government, prevent intra- and inter-tribal disputes, and dole out provincial and federal funding to tribal chiefs as he saw fit.  PAs hold the powers of Magistrate, Sessions Judge, and implementing agent for  ISLAMABAD 00007164  004.2 OF 005   Federal Government Orders. Traditionally, PAs have relied on the good-will and assistance of Tribal Chiefs, which they often bought with bribes and offers of greater funds for the tribe. PAs also needed assistance from the levy and Khasdar (militia) forces in their Agency to administer law and order.  Over time, the influence of PAs over tribes has waned and they have been seen as corrupt and out-of-step with tribal interests. Tribes often put more stock into decisions made by a jirga (a tribal council of elders empowered with decision-making and negotiating authority by a tribe or the Agency population) or their increasingly influential religious leaders than the decisions and threats made by Political Agents. The financial leverage Political Agents hold over tribes may also hold less sway today than it once did, largely due to the income provided by smuggling and other illicit activities.  Legal Muddle ------------ 6. (U) Constitutionally, laws passed by the GOP do not apply in FATA.  FATA residents cannot seek legal redress in either NWFP's provincial courts or the federal judiciary because neither has jurisdiction there.  The GOP's "Criminal Procedure Code," which underpins the foundation of Criminal Law in Pakistan does not fully apply in FATA and is often supplanted by Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR), an arcane code of laws that relies on the principle of collective punishment to prevent (and punish) crimes ranging from banditry and crime to harboring fugitives and being "unfriendly to the government". Punishments include: arresting family members of perpetrators, demolishing houses or villages found in violation of codes, levying fines on households or imposing economic blockades. For example, houses found to harbor fugitives can be demolished after one warning.  FCR does not allow the right to appeal sentences or judgments at the High Court or Supreme Court level.  7. (U) When the Political Agent (or tribe) chooses, civil and criminal disputes can be solved by a jirga--a council of elders. According to the FCR, the Political Agent can choose to depute the powers of magistrate to a council of elders, when either of the parties in a dispute belongs to a frontier tribe, or, when the crime is likely to cause a blood feud. The jirga implements decisions either based on Pakhtunwali tribal code, Sharia, or a combination thereof.  Decisions by the jirga are final and cannot be appealed. Jirgas are also used to settle inter-tribal disputes and disputes between the government and a tribe (or individual).  Stone-Age Development --------------------- 8.  (SBU) In terms of social, economic and political development, the FATA and its neighboring Provincially Administered Tribal Areas are the least developed regions in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, less than 18 percent of the population is literate (compared to a national average of 48 percent), and less than 20 percent of males and 6 percent of females (on average) make it past primary school. Access to health care (1  bed per 1450 people and 1 doctor for 1529 patients), clean water, sanitation, electricity and irrigation is also abysmal, putting parts of FATA figuratively and realistically "back in the stone age."  9. (SBU) Political development in the FATA has traditionally been rooted in a tribal culture of collective decision-making by un-elected maliks. Political party activity is banned in the region, though representatives of the religio-political party, Jamaat-e Ulema-e Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F), have a base in tribal politics because many mosque-leaders are members of the party and disseminate the party line at weekly prayer services. In 1996, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto introduced elections in the FATA by calling for the election of eight tribal Ministers of the National Assembly (MNAs).  Prior to this election, tribal elders represented  ISLAMABAD 00007164  005.2 OF 005   each agency. In 1997, MNAs were chosen by universal adult franchise. In 2002, the election resulted in the election of 12 nominally-independent MNAs and 8 nominally independent Senators (most vote in line with the JUI-F and the Islamist MMA alliance). The government uses statistics (such as the lower-than-average voter turnout (approximately 45% in 2002) and the negligible turnout of women) to argue that the tribal system in FATA does not allow for "one man, one vote" style elections, an argument it continues to posit today to explain the dearth of political party activity in the FATA.

UNCLAS ISLAMABAD 007423   USDOC FOR 532/OEA/MHAMES/R.JERESKI USDOC FOR 3131/USFCS/OIO REGIONAL DIRECTOR BOBETTE ORR/RKREISSL  STATE FOR EB/ESP  U.S. CUSTOMS HQ FOR STRATEGIC INVESTIGATIONS  HONG KONG FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHE  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: BMGT, ETTC, PK  SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION CHECK: ADVANCED ENGINEERING RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. (NO LICENSE REQUIRED)  1. On March 7, 2006, EconOff and FCS FSN visited Advanced Engineering Research Organization (AERO), located at Air Weapons Complex (AWC), Haripur Road, Wah. The purpose of the visit was to conduct a Post Shipment Verification check on the shipment of a "Digital Compass Module" exported by GECS, Inc., 500 Dobbin Court, Accokeek, MD 20607.   2. At the AERO facility, the USG staff met with Wing Commander (Retired) Muhammad Anwar Hamid, Director Logistics (Tel: 92-51-90182015, Fax: 92-51-90187228, Email: janjua742@hotmail.com, Cellphone: 92-300-5005917). Wing Cdr. Hamid, along with two other technical staff, spent approximately twenty minutes explaining the end use of the three sets of Honeywell HMR 3000 compass modules he had displayed on his desk.  According to Hamid, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is installing these modules in an attempt to increase the navigational accuracy of its Mirage fleet.  The PAF is not satisfied with the accuracy of the Chinese-made "flex valves" currently used in its aircraft.  The compass modules are still in a testing phase; PAF will decide whether or not to install the modules in its entire fleet upon completion of the testing.  AERO says it will purchase dozens more compass modules, but not necessarily from a U.S. company, if the testing results in increased navigational accuracy.   3.  USG staff also questioned Hamid about the role of AERO. According to Hamid, AERO is an independent research and consultancy division under the Ministry of Defense; its sole client is the PAF.  Hamid stated that AERO is co-located with the Air Weapons Complex (AWC), but works independently of it.  The USG staff noted concern about the time (first access request sent to AERO in June 2005) it had taken to schedule the AERO PSV.  Hamid said that he would bring this to the attention of his superior officers and would look into streamlining the procedure for any future checks. Hamid stated that scheduling took so long because AERO had to first get approval from Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to grant USG officials access; it was the MFA who contacted USG officials to schedule the PSV.  It may be noted that AERO is located approximately 60 km NE of Islamabad and AERO provided a roundtrip-armed escort to the USG staff on this visit; as a result, USG staff had no difficulty accessing the facility.   4. It seemed apparent from the discussion with AERO officials that the PAF uses the compass modules for navigational purposes.  The AERO reps seemed knowledgeable about the PAF's future requirements and Hamid gave a brief talk on the PAF's new JF-7 aircraft that are being manufactured with Chinese collaboration.  It must be noted, however, that aside from the main office building, USG officials did not visit (nor ask to do so) any other locations on the AWC compound.  Apparently, AERO and AWC are part of Pakistan's military establishment and certain restrictions apply for non-military personnel visiting this site.   5. Recommendation: At this time Post does not have any adverse information on AERO and has no evidence that the item listed in this PSV check has been used for any application other than that stated by the AERO officials. However, AERO is located within the same extended compound as the Air Weapons Complex, which is a classified military site.  Based on our meeting with AERO and the scant information that we have on this organization, at this time Post is not in a position to confirm nor challenge the reliability of AERO as an end user of higher-end U.S. technology.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 007505  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PK, PGOV, PREL, IRNB SUBJECT: CABINET RESHUFFLE BRINGS PROMOTIONS, DEMOTIONS, AND NEW FACES  1. (SBU) Summary. After several weeks of speculation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has selected some bright party stars, rewarded PML loyalists, and switched the portfolios of four ministers in a cabinet reshuffle on April 26. Presiding over a ceremony at Aiwan-e Sadar, President Musharraf and Aziz swore in six new Federal Ministers and three new Ministers of State. In a nod to "good governance," Sheikh Rashid, a controversial figure at the Information Ministry, was switched to the Ministry of Railways, and low-performer Faisal Saleh Hayat was moved to the Ministry of Environment. Their retention in the Cabinet is out of political necessity; PML needs PPP-Patriots (Hayat's Party) and Rashid's influence in Rawalpindi in the 2007 election. The two new Ministries--Interprovincial Provincial Affairs and Political Affairs--also reflect the political needs of the hour: a unified strategy for dealing with deteriorating center-provincial relations (Inter-provincial Affairs), strengthening PML and building political alliances head of the 2007 election (Political Affairs). All of the new members are PML. End summary.  CABINET CHANGES --------------- 2. (SBU) Cabinet Block officially announced late Tuesday evening that the following changes have been made to Shaukat Aziz's Cabinet:  Federal Ministers: Minister for Information              Mohammad Ali Durrani Minister for Railways                 Sheikh Rashid Ahmed Minister for Tourism                  Nilofar Bakhtiar Minister for Privatization            Zahid Hamid Minister for Youth Affairs            Sumaira Malik (also Advisor to the PM on Womens' Development) Minister for Political Affairs        Amir Muqam Minister for Environment              Faisal Saleh Hayat Minister for Kashmir Affairs          Major Tahir Iqbal Minister for Sports                   Shamim Haider Minister for Culture                  GG Jamal  Minsters of State (MoS): MoS for Information                   Tariq Azeem Khan MoS for Education                     Anisa Zeb Tahir Kheli MoS for Minorities                    Mushtaq Victor MoS for Defense                       Khalid Lund MoS for Parliamentary Affairs         Kamal Ali Agha Mos for Overseas Pakistanis           Raza Hayat Hiraj MoS for Interior                      Zafar Warraich MoS for Youth Affairs                 Ghulam Bibi Bharwana  BIO HIGHLIGHTS -------------- 3. (SBU) The following is a brief sketch of the Cabinet members whose portfolios have been elevated, as well as the three new members:  Muhammad Ali Durrani (Minister of Information): Durrani is an up-and-coming leader in PML, which he joined in 2002 after helping to merge the Milat Party with the ruling PML. He formerly served as the Secretary General of the Milat Party and National Party. In 2004, he was made the MoS for Youth, Culture, and Sports and has served as a Special Advisor to the Prime Minister. He is said to have the backing of ISI. He is a Mechanical Engineer and Educator by profession. He speaks fluent English, Urdu, Punjabi, Seraiki, and Pashto.  Salim Saifullah Khan (Minister for Intra-Provincial Affairs): Saifullah was selected for his political influence not only in NWFP, but in Sindh and Balochistan as well. He is a first-term Senator (elected March 2006) but long-time politician. He was PML Secretary General until 2002 but lost position and influence in the party after the rise of Chaudhary Shujaat. He has served as a Federal Minister under PM Junejo and a Provincial Minister in NWFP. His brother Anwar was a long-term PPP politician. According to his  ISLAMABAD 00007505  002 OF 003   official bio, his family hails from a long line of Khans from Ghor, Afghanistan. He is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University.  Engineer Amir Muqam (Minister for Political Affairs): Muqam is a first-term MNA from Shangla, Swat. He comes from an influential family in NWFP, and has served as an informal advisor to the PM and President on FATA while serving as the Minister of State for Water and Power. Between 2001-2002, he served as the Union Council Nazim from Bengalin. Muqam has a BSC from the University of Engineering and Technology in Peshawar. He was born on July 25, 1963; he is married with four sons and two daughters. PML leaders are seeking to boost Muqam and the provincial NWFP PML party he heads ahead of the 2007 elections.  Sumaira Malik (Minister for Youth; Advisor on Womens' Development): Malik is a first-term MNA from Kushab, Punjab. She hails from a politically influential feudal family. Her uncle is former President Farooq Leghari, her brother-in-law is Sardar Yar Mohammad Rind, and her sister is fellow first term MNA Aiyla Malik. Her husband is reportedly a high-ranking civil servant in the influential District Management Group.  Sumaira served as the Minister of State for Tourism from 2004-2006, and is being rewarded for her loyalty to the party; some also say her promotion is a nod to Leghari, whose support PML needs in 2007. Maik was born on December 19, 1963.  Zahid Hamid Khan (Minister for Privatization): Khan is a first-term PML MNA from the successful, business-oriented Sialkot district. He is a practicing lawyer, a former member of the Civil Service, and an industrialist. Hamid holds a BA and MA from Cambridge University, and an LLB from the University of Punjab. He previously served as Minister of State for Defense, and is being rewarded for his loyalty to PML during the contentious local bodies elections in Sialkot.  Nilofar Bakhtiar (Minister of Tourism): Bakhtiar has served as the Prime Minister's Advisor on Womens' Development since 2004. She has also been in charge of the Ministry of Womens Affairs, Social Development, and Special Education (though she was not officially a Minister). Bakhtiar won a Senate seat in March 2006.  Professor Mushtaq Victor (Minister of State for Minorities): Victor is a first-term MNA from Sialkot and holds a seat reserved for minorities (he is Christian). He has previously served as an MPA from Punjab. During his first term as MNA, he was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Minority Affairs. He was a member of PPP until 2002, when he became politically aligned with PML.  He is a Professor of History, who received his MA from the University of Punjab in 1972. He was born on March 20, 1942 and is married with two sons and two daughters.  Kamil Ali Agha (Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs): Senator Agha is a long-time politician, who has earned the favor of parties across the political spectrum. He most recently served as the Chief Whip in the Senate, and is well respected for his ability to keep discussions moving civilly. He was first elected district Councillor in 1979, and again in 1990, and deputy Nazim in 1990. In 1997, he was elected to the National Assembly, and served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In 2003, he was elected to the  SIPDIS Senate. He is reportedly allied with the Chief Minister of Punjab and has been selected for his statesmanly performance in the Senate.  He is a lawyer by profession.  Khalid Lund (Minister of State for Defense): Lund is a third-term MNA from Ghotki, Punjab.  Until two weeks ago, he was a member of the PPP-Patriots; he defected and joined PML.  In his first two terms as MNA, he was a member of the PPP. He is an agriculturalist by profession. He is being rewarded with the Ministerial position in return for his defection  ISLAMABAD 00007505  003 OF 003   from the Patriots.  COMMENT ------- 4. (SBU) Three of the new inductees filled slots vacated by the March 2006 Senate Election; the other positions were shuffled to punish bad performance and reward party stars and loyalists. Following through with his August 2004 pledge for good-governance, Aziz appears to be responding to PML Rawalpindi boss Sheikh Rashid's dismal performance as Minister of Information and PPP-Patriot Faisal Saleh Hayat's non-performance at the Ministry of Kashmir and Northern Areas. Their retention in the Cabinet (albeit in less important portfolios) is a nod to the political reality that both are still inflential politicians whose support PML needs in the 2007 elections. The creation of an Inter-Provincial Liaison portfolio (Saifullah) reflects the GOP's recognition that there needs to be a unified strategy for dealing with deteriorating center-provincial relations (particularly Balochistan and FATA). Muqam's new Ministry (Political Affairs) was presumably created to orchestrate party "understandings" for the 2007 election and give the non-political PM Aziz another political advisor. We expect that this will not be the last Cabinet reshuffle, as the ruling party lines up its team for the 2007 elections. End comment. BODDE

(C) Summary:  The Tripartite Commission (TPC) Met at GHQ in Rawalpindi April 19 -- the third Tripartite conducted at the four-star level and the second official visit to Pakistan by Afghanistan's Chief of the General Staff.  Atmospherics were favorable, continuing a trend seen in earlier TPC meetings. Key outcomes included agreement to hold a counter-IED symposium in May at Bagram for Coalition, Afghan and Pakistani participants, agreement to post Afghan and Pakistani intelligence LNOs at CFC-A HQ, with the long-term goal of moving these intel LNOs to Bagram after a validation period, a personal invitation from the ANA G-2 for his Pakistani counterpart (DGMI) to visit him in Kabul, and a summary of the inaugural Afghan-Pakistani Confidence Building Seminar, held in March at the Marshall Center in Germany. All three sides briefed their roles and provided an update on Operation Mountain Lion.  Pakistani and Afghan participants acknowledged the significance of the ANA participation in Exercise Inspired Gambit scheduled for 1-12 May.  All sides expressed support for accepting NATO-ISAF as a full member of the Tripartite Commission and for expanding the Border Subcommittee to include the southern border region -- though on both issues, the Pakistanis indicated they need to work internally before the GOP can offer official concurrence. End Summary.  2.  (U) Participants met in Rawalpindi on April 19, 2006 for the 16th Tripartite Commission (TPC) Plenary Session. The Pakistani and Afghan sides were led at the four star level by Vice Chief of Army Staff General Ahsan Hyat and ANA Chief of General Staff General Bismullah Khan respectively.  CFC-A Commander Lt General Karl Eikenberry led the U.S. side. Others participating on the Pakistani side included Pakistan's Ambassador in Kabul Tariq Aziz Ud Din, Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) MG Muhammad Yousaf, Incoming DGMO MG Ahmed Shuja Pasha, Director General of Military Intelligence MG Nadeem Taj, Director of Military Operations BG Nasser Khan Janjua, and Director of Military Intelligence BG Raza Muhammad.  The Afghan side included ANA Chief of Operations Lt Gen Sher Karimi, DG of the Afghan Border Police LG Haroon Asefi, Ambassador to Pakistan Nangulalai Tarzi and ANA Chief of Intelligence MG Abdul Khaliq.  U.S. participants included MG Benjamin Freakley and BG James Terry.  BG Richard Tabor represented NATO/ISAF.  3.  (C) Atmospherics at the TPC were favorable, helped by a dinner the previous evening hosted by General Ahsan at his residence.  On the morning of the TPC, General Bismullah was received with full honors.  During the meeting, both sides spoke repeatedly of "brotherly relations" and the need for trust and improved coordination at the operational level. General Ahsan opened the meeting by stressing that Pakistan remained committed to good relations with Afghanistan, adding that the two countries faced a common enemy opposed to peace in the region.  General Bismullah expressed appreciation for Pakistan's efforts in the border regions and offered condolences for Pakistan Army "shahids" who had been killed in Waziristan.  Underscoring that the two countries shared common interests in regional stability, he urged Pakistan to focus increased attention on border areas in the south, where Taliban and Al Qa'ida elements were infiltrating and destabilizing Afghanistan's southern provinces.  Lt. General Eikenberry noted the shift of international operations toward NATO/ISAF, explaining that at the end of July MG Freakley would wear two hats as both as operational commander of Regional Command East and as Deputy Commander under NATO/ISAF.  Border Security Subcommittee ----------------------------  4.  (C) BG Terry briefed on progress in the Border Security Subcommittee Meeting (BSSM), including improving communications capabilities connecting the two sides.  A secure computer system now links CJTF-76 HQ and Pakistani counterparts, and a secure, high-frequency radio system expected to be delivered by early May will give Coalition units the ability to coordinate directly with Pakistani units on the other side of the border.  BG Nasser observed that the frequency of border violations had declined and that all sides recognized the "sanctity of borders."  He noted the  ISLAMABAD 00007563  002 OF 003   killing in Afghanistan of seventeen Pakistanis and Afghan assurances that "necessary action" would be taken.  Lt. General Eikenberry noted that as the BSSM expanded to cover Regional Command South it would confront a different configuration of deployments and threats.  General Ahsan, while supportive in principle, said that this transition would require careful thought, given that in Pakistan's 12th Corps region (Balochistan) the geography and demographics were very different than in the 11th Corps region (the Tribal Areas).  Given that the area was very sparsely populated, there would be an increased need for surveillance capability and mobility.  "We need to get together and get deeper into it," he concluded.  Military Intelligence Sharing Working Group -------------------------------------------  5.   (C) Following an update on the Military Intelligence Subcommittee, General Ahsan noted that there was a need for a deeper understanding of principles relating to intelligence, which should be "preventive, preemptive and predictive."  The Afghan side stressed the need for better intelligence and communication on the recruitment and deployment of suicide bombers.  The Pakistanis emphasized the need to deploy liaison officers quickly and the importance of tracking and blocking weapons trafficking, which was affecting law and order in Balochistan with direct implications for stability in bordering areas of Afghanistan.  Lt. General Eikenberry noted that with respect to intelligence cooperation, other national agencies were also involved and it would be important to avoid redundancy.  There was a tentative agreement to post Afghan and Pakistani intelligence LNOs at CFC-A HQ, with the long-term goal of moving these intel LNOs to Bagram after a validation period.  Counter IED Working Group -------------------------  6. (C) After a presentation on the way ahead on counter-IED cooperation and a comparative assessment of counter IED capabilities, the Pakistani and Afghan sides commended progress in the Working Group and agreed that IEDs represented a common threat.  General Ahsan responded to an Afghan request for technical assistance by saying Pakistan, after suffering significant losses of its own, had developed safety measures and procedures that it would share.  He also stressed the need to target the full IED supply chain, beginning with funding sources.   A Counter-IED Symposium, jointly hosted by CFC-A and ARCENT, will be held at the end of May at Bagram, and attended by Coalition, Afghan and Pakistani participants.  Operation Mountain Lion -----------------------  7.  (C) Lt. General Karimi briefed on ANA and Coalition shaping and border operations, explaining that the ANA's 201st, 203rd and 205th Corps were participating in the operation with coalition forces.  201st Corps is participating as part of the Coalition main effort, with battalions conducting Joint Patrolling and Offensive Operations in Pech and Korengal Valleys; 203d Corps is conducting joint border operations in Khowst, Paktika and Zabol Provinces, and 205th Corps is conducting shaping operations in southern Afghanistan.  8.  (C) BG Nasser reviewed Pakistani deployments in support of Operation Mountain Lion, including:  -- Blocking positions established at 3 locations (Arandu, Chitral; Bin Shahi, Dir; Nawa Pass, Bajaur) -- to interdict key infiltration routes --133 Army and Frontier Corps posts in the area -- 7 Frontier Corps Wings already deployed to Chitral/Dir/Bajaur -- Additional units moved in to support Operation Mountain Lion, including:         - 2 Army Infantry Battalions (one pulled from           the earthquake area)         - 3 FC Wings         - 1 SOTF Company  ISLAMABAD 00007563  003 OF 003           - 1 Medium Artillery Battalion     - 3 Mortar batteries         - SSG and Aviation support from Peshawar are           also available as required         - a total of approximately 3000 personnel deployed  9.  (C) BG Nasser also reviewed operations in the tribal areas since the last TPC on February 26:  -- March 1: Nur Payo Khan (Sedgai), 45 enemy KIA; 46 enemy WIA -- March 4: Miram Shah and Mir Ali, 65-70 enemy KIA -- March 7: Miram Shah Operations to destroy militant madrassas and militants' buildings -- March 10: Khatti Kili (Sadiq Noor Compound), 25-30 enemy KIA -- April 4: Operation Mana, 40  enemy KIA; 19 apprehended -- April 12: Operation Naghar, 13 enemy KIA; (including HVT Abdul Rehman; 7 foreigners KIA) -- Total of 25 militant houses demolished during the time period.  Looking ahead, Nasser explained that "jeepable" tracks in the border area would be blocked, sweep operations and "snap" operations by SSG and SOTF would continue, Miram Shah and Mir Ali would remain a "weapons free declared" area and a night curfew would be imposed in border areas.  Also, a political process would be implemented alongside military operations.  Confidence Building Seminars -------------------------  10.  (C) ANA J-2 Col. Salahuddin praised the recent joint Pakistan-Afghanistan seminar in Germany, saying that by the end of the session participants on both sides had overcome suspicions and become friends.  Pakistani LTC Dar, also a Garmisch participant, echoed Salahuddin's views on the confidence-building value of the seminars. CFC explained that two sessions would be held annually over the next five years, focusing on field grade officers and officers serving in the border regions.  Tripartite Way Ahead --------------------  11.  (C) Summing up, Lt. General Eikenberry noted that key areas to address were structural issues relating to the next steps in the intelligence sharing working group and the expansion of the BSSM to the south (involving Pakistan's 12th Corps and Frontier Corp).  He proposed that representatives from all sides meet in Pakistan to agree on modalities.  He reassured the Pakistani side that the expansion of NATO/ISAF would not mean a diminution in U.S. capability; the U.S. would still provide the most  "boots on the ground," contributing on intelligence and air support, among other areas.  He expressed the hope that at the next Tripartite in June, NATO/ISAF could be brought in as a full partner. General Ahsan was agreeable in principle on the expansion of the BSSM to the South but indicated that Pakistan would have to vet this concept through the Joint Staff before final approval.  On full NATO membership starting with the June Tripartite, Gen. Ahsan said this would "in all probability" occur, but would also require formal approval.  General Ahsan voiced his satisfaction that the ANA would participate in the U.S.-Pakistan Exercise Inspired Gambit.  General Bismullah Khan, invited Pakistani  DGMO-designate MG  Pasha to visit Afghanistan, emphasized the importance of trust in achieving common goals and again sought to draw Pakistan's attention to the southern border region.  12.

S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ISLAMABAD 007564  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2016 TAGS: PREL, PK, PGOV, MASS, MOPS, PTER, MCAP SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR S/CT AMBASSADOR CRUMPTON  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Peter W. Bodde, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1. (S) The U.S. Mission in Pakistan warmly welcomes your planned May 3-4 visit to Pakistan.  As demonstrated during President Bush's visit to Islamabad, both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz are western-oriented modernizers who are trying to move Pakistan toward Musharraf's goal of "enlightened moderation." They viewed the President's visit as a landmark in the relationship and were gratified that he decided to stay overnight in Pakistan.  Your visit comes as Pakistan's leaders have weathered the fallout from the Danish cartoon controversy, but continue to be challenged by violent separatists in Balochistan, al-Qa'ida and extremists in the tribal areas along the Afghan border, and the transition from earthquake relief operations to long-term reconstruction. Robust USG participation in the earthquake relief effort has promoted a more positive public perception of the United States, but Pakistan remains a tough public diplomacy environment.  We believe that your visit will help advance key U.S. objectives, including democratization, regional stability, and progress in the global war on terror.  U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Partnership ----------------------------------- 2. (S) During his March visit to Pakistan, President Bush launched a U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Partnership.  This initiative has been institutionalized in the framework of a Strategic Dialogue that incorporates discussions on: economic growth and prosperity, energy cooperation, peace and security, social sector development, science and technology, democracy, and non-proliferation.  In the wake of President Bush's visit, and with the prospect of a U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, Pakistan's political class has been wracked by a bout of insecurity and "me-tooism." Even President Musharraf has complained privately that there is now a public perception that the U.S. is distancing itself from him.  The inaugural meeting of the Strategic Dialogue will be held in Washington from April 26-27, and should help reassure Pakistan of the breadth and depth of our long-term commitment.  The Cartoon Controversy ----------------------- 3. (C) In February and early March, tens of thousands of Pakistani demonstrators took to the streets to protest the publication of the Danish cartoons.  Early rallies in Lahore and Peshawar were particularly destructive, with rampant looting and vandalism in parts of downtown Lahore and Peshawar and six protesters killed.  Although demonstrations followed across Pakistan, enhanced security measures by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) prevented any repetition of the unrestrained violence seen in February.  Over time, the protests took on a greater political tone, as opportunistic politicians sought to embarrass the Musharraf government. The protests have died out but it took Federal government intervention to quell them.  Following President Bush's lead, your visit presents an opportunity to remind the Pakistani people that the United States understands the sentiments of the Muslim community and that, although we strongly support freedom of expression, we also believe the press should behave responsibly.  Earthquake Relief ----------------- 4. (U) The October 8 earthquake (7.6 on the Richter scale) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was the strongest to hit the region in over a century.  The GOP estimates that more than 73,000 died in the quake, with more than 69,000 wounded and some 2.8 million left homeless.  The United States had been Pakistan's most visible international partner in delivering emergency relief during the sixth month effort.  5. (U) The U.S. military, which had been on the ground since October 10, concluded its relief operations on March 31.  At the peak of initial relief efforts, more than 1,200 personnel and 24 helicopters provided vital transport, logistics, and  ISLAMABAD 00007564  002 OF 004   medical and engineering support in affected areas.  As we wrapped up our military relief operations, we donated more than USD 2.5 million in medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts.  Our Seabee unit also left behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineers.  6. (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services to camps and villages.  USAID provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including the donation of blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to the affected population.  In March, USAID made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15 million to rebuild schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged USD 510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately USD 24 million.  Independent estimates place total U.S. private donations at over USD 130 million.  7. (C) Our prompt and generous response sparked a perceptible shift in Pakistani attitudes about the United States that has improved bilateral relations at official levels.  The cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army.  Throughout the draw-down of our military presence, we emphasized that our transition parallels the shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort.  The Pakistanis, who have long been convinced that we are fair-weather friends, are beginning to understand that we are committed to a long-term relationship.  Democratization --------------- 8. (C) President Musharraf has committed - publicly and privately - to move Pakistan toward a civilian-led democracy by the next national elections, which must be held by 2007. The government must address significant organizational issues before the 2007 national elections, but it has taken an important initial step with the March appointment of a permanent, independent election commissioner acceptable to all mainstream parties.  At the operational level, USAID supports democratization efforts with programs to promote institutional development of the courts, the legislatures, and the political parties.  9. (C) Press commentary following A/S Boucher's April 4-6 visit to Pakistan gave considerable attention to his public remarks, including his observation that the United States believes in civilian leadership of the military.  GOP officials have voiced concern that this is creating the false impression that the U.S. is distancing itself from the President.  In any public or private remarks, you will want to underscore our strong relationship with President Musharraf and his government, noting our appreciation for his contributions in the war on terror, his efforts to improve relations with India and the steps he has taken to advance democracy in Pakistan, such as freedom of the press and the appointment of an Independent Election Commissioner.  Afghanistan ----------- 10. (S) The roller-coaster relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan continues to suffer from mutual suspicion and recrimination, with Afghans concerned about cross-border infiltration and Pakistan worried that India is using its assets in Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  President Musharraf, his government and military leaders recognize Pakistan must support the Karzai government as it attempts to solidify its control over the country.  To that end, the Government is committed to cooperating on operational security matters with the Afghan government and coalition forces through regular Tripartite Commission meetings.  That  ISLAMABAD 00007564  003 OF 004   said, the two leaders have difficulty restraining themselves from engaging in destructive public rhetoric in which each blames the other for not doing enough to effectively prosecute the battle against their common enemies in the tribal areas along the border.  India and Kashmir ----------------- 11. (S) President Musharraf and his senior advisors say that they have made a strategic decision to end the Kashmiri militancy; even Indian officials acknowledge the level of violence and cross-border infiltration has declined (though some New Delhi officials attribute this to Indian security measures).  President Musharraf believes the GOP's ability to control Kashmiri militants will be greatly enhanced if there is measurable progress with India on Kashmir.  He has specifically pushed for a withdrawal of Indian forces from key population centers in Indian-administered Kashmir (a demand viewed with great skepticism in New Delhi).  President Musharraf has privately signaled flexibility on the final status of Kashmir, but in public remains steadfast in rejecting the Line of Control (LOC) as a permanent international boundary.  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that New Delhi is not afraid to discuss pragmatic solutions to make the LOC less-relevant in people's lives, but has also chided Pakistan for holding normalization of bilateral relations hostage to a final resolution of the Kashmir dispute.  Limited measures following the October earthquake to facilitate cross-LOC travel and communication have the potential to change the dynamic in Kashmir and may accelerate internal pressure on Islamabad and New Delhi to create additional space for interaction between Kashmiris in India and Pakistan.  13. (C) While there has been little progress on core issues relating to Kashmir, senior Indian and Pakistani officials meet regularly through the Composite Dialogue process, which has produced some confidence-building measures, including a pre-notification agreement for ballistic missile launches and the opening of five bus and two train routes between the two countries.  India and Pakistan have also, after 17 years, revived the Joint Commission to provide a forum for discussions on technical issues such as science and technology, information technology, telecommunications, and tourism.  The Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency and the India Central Bureau of Investigation recently initiated discussions aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation on human trafficking, currency counterfeiting, and illegal immigration.  14. (S) India has long resisted the involvement of third parties in settling the Kashmir issue.  Although senior Pakistani leaders understand that any move toward a direct mediating role by the U.S. would be counterproductive, many Pakistanis believe that the U.S. should lean on New Delhi to facilitate a settlement.  President Musharraf was pleased by President Bush's even-handed statements about the need for good relations between India and Pakistan and for a peaceful resolution of the dispute on terms acceptable to Pakistan, India, and the people of Kashmir.  Global War on Terrorism ----------------------- 15. (S) Pakistan deserves commendation for standing with us in the global war on terror, including its efforts to deny al Qa'ida and other extremist elements safe haven in Pakistan's untamed tribal areas along the Afghan border. Following the GOP's decision to extend central government control into the FATA (historically a "no go" region for government forces), we have regularly encouraged Pakistani security forces to stay the course in the face of armed resistance.  Since December 2005, the security situation in Waziristan has deteriorated, forcing the GOP to rethink its strategy. President Musharraf has articulated a three-pronged approach comprising political initiatives, economic development and military operations that are faster, leaner and more targeted than in the past.  The Pakistan military has suffered over 1,000 casualties in the FATA, with particularly heavy  ISLAMABAD 00007564  004 OF 004   fighting during the first week of March, when militants occupied a key town in North Waziristan.  We have offered to assist Pakistan's economic development efforts in the FATA and to provide training and rapid strike capabilities as it realigns its military tactics.  16. (C) In the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings, President Musharraf cracked down on terrorist/extremist organizations in Pakistan to much public fanfare.  We are still assessing whether the President has the will to hold the line against Pakistan's extremist elements for the long run.  Initial law enforcement actions targeted the usual suspects--conservative clerics and Islamist politicians--prompting a strong popular backlash, with conservatives decrying the focus on Islamists.  Ultimately, the government released most detainees and watered down regulations intended to provide transparency on madrassa operations.  We have repeatedly pressed senior GOP officials to act decisively against the operational leaders of key terrorist and extremist groups, including those involved in earthquake relief efforts in northern Pakistan.  We have also encouraged GOP officials to take action against madrassas that support, recruit for, or shelter these organizations.  Balochistan ----------- 17. (S) Pakistani leaders are also struggling to cope with an insurgency in the resource-rich province of Balochistan, as local Baloch tribesmen seek to redress historic grievances against Pakistan and seize a greater share of their provincial patrimony.  President Musharraf has swung back and forth between civilian advisors who are counseling a negotiated settlement, and military advisors who view the insurgency as an Indian-sponsored threat to national unity that must be suppressed. At the moment, the pendulum appears ready to swing toward the military option. This has clear implications for the military's ability to pursue shared U.S.-Pakistan objectives in the FATA and in the war on terror.  Pakistani security forces are already over-stretched along the Afghan border, in North and South Waziristan, and in managing periodic domestic civil unrest such as the cartoon controversy and sectarian tension.  An escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year.  BODDE

As we wrapped up our military relief operations, we donated more than USD 2.5 million in medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts.  Our Seabee unit also left behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineers.  6. (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services to camps and villages.  USAID provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including the donation of blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to the affected population.  In March, USAID made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15 million to rebuild schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged USD 510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately USD 24 million.  Independent estimates place  ISLAMABAD 00007629  002.3 OF 005   total U.S. private donations at over USD 130 million.  7. (C) Our prompt and generous response sparked a perceptible shift in Pakistani attitudes about the United States that has improved bilateral relations at official levels.  The cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army.  Throughout the draw-down of our military presence, we emphasized that our transition parallels the shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort.  The Pakistanis, who have long been convinced that we are fair-weather friends, are beginning to understand that we are committed to a long-term relationship.  Democratization --------------- 8. (C) President Musharraf has committed - publicly and privately - to move Pakistan toward a civilian-led democracy by the next national elections, which must be held by 2007. The government must address significant organizational issues before the 2007 national elections, but it has taken an important initial step with the March appointment of a permanent, independent election commissioner acceptable to all mainstream parties.  At the operational level, USAID supports democratization efforts with programs to promote institutional development of the courts, the legislatures, and the political parties.  9. (C) Press commentary following A/S Boucher's April 4-6 visit to Pakistan gave considerable attention to his public remarks, including his observation that the United States believes in civilian leadership of the military.  GOP officials have voiced concern that this is creating the false impression that the U.S. is distancing itself from teh President.  In any public or private remarks, DCG participants will want to underscore our strong relationship with President Musharraf and his goverment, noting our appreciation for his contributions in the war on terror, his efforts to improve relations with India and the steps he has taken to advance democracy in Pakistan, such as freedom of the press and the appointment of an Independent Election Commissioner.  Afghanistan ----------- 10. (S) The roller-coaster relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan continues to suffer from mutual suspicion and recrimination, with Afghans concerned about cross-border infiltration and Pakistan worried that India is using its assets in Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  President Musharraf, his government and military leaders recognize Pakistan must support the Karzai government as it attempts to solidify its control over the country.  To that end, the Government is committed to cooperating on operational security matters with the Afghan government and coalition forces through regular Tripartite Commission meetings.  That said, the two leaders have difficulty restraining themselves from engaging in destructive public rhetoric in which each blames the other for not doing enough to effectively prosecute the battle against their common enemies in the tribal areas along the border.  India and Kashmir ----------------- 11. (S) President Musharraf and his senior advisors say that they have made a strategic decision to end the Kashmiri militancy; even Indian officials acknowledge the level of violence and cross-border infiltration has declined (though some New Delhi officials attribute this to Indian security measures).  President Musharraf believes the GOP's ability to control Kashmiri militants will be greatly enhanced if there is measurable progress with India on Kashmir.  He has specifically pushed for a withdrawal of Indian forces from key population centers in Indian-administered Kashmir (a demand viewed with great skepticism in New Delhi).  President Musharraf has privately signaled flexibility on the final status of Kashmir, but in public remains steadfast in rejecting the Line of Control (LOC) as a permanent international boundary.  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that New Delhi is not afraid to discuss pragmatic solutions to make the LOC less-relevant in people's lives, but has also chided Pakistan for holding normalization of  ISLAMABAD 00007629  003.2 OF 005   bilateral relations hostage to a final resolution of the Kashmir dispute.  Limited measures following the October earthquake to facilitate cross-LOC travel and communication have the potential to change the dynamic in Kashmir and may accelerate internal pressure on Islamabad and New Delhi to create additional space for interaction between Kashmiris in India and Pakistan.  12. (C) While there has been little progress on core issues relating to Kashmir, senior Indian and Pakistani officials meet regularly through the Composite Dialogue process, which has produced some confidence-building measures, including a pre-notification agreement for ballistic missile launches and the opening of five bus and two train routes between the two countries.  India and Pakistan have also, after 17 years, revived the Joint Commission to provide a forum for discussions on technical issues such as science and technology, information technology, telecommunications, and tourism.  The Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency and the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation recently initiated discussions aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation on human trafficking, currency counterfeiting, and illegal immigration.  13. (S) India has long resisted the involvement of third parties in settling the Kashmir issue.  Senior Pakistani leaders understand that any move toward a direct mediating role by the U.S. would be counterproductive, and President Musharraf was pleased by President Bush's statement calling for a peaceful resolution of the dispute on terms acceptable to Pakistan, India, and the people of Kashmir.  As many Pakistani civilian and military officials share the public's perception that the U.S. should lean on New Delhi to facilitate a settlement, DCG participants should be prepared to respond to calls for greater USG involvement by citing President Bush's even-handed remarks.  Global War on Terrorism ----------------------- 14. (S) Pakistan deserves commendation for standing with us in the global war on terror, including its efforts to deny al Qa'ida and other extremist elements safe haven in Pakistan's untamed tribal areas along the Afghan border. Following the GOP's decision to extend central government control into the FATA (historically a "no go" region for government forces), we have regularly encouraged Pakistani security forces to stay the course in the face of armed resistance.  Since December 2005, the security situation in Waziristan has deteriorated, forcing the GOP to rethink its strategy. President Musharraf has articulated a three-pronged approach comprising political initiatives, economic development and military operations that are faster, leaner and more targeted than in the past.  The Pakistan military has suffered over 1,000 casualties in the FATA, with particularly heavy fighting during the first week of March, when militants occupied a key town in North Waziristan.  We have offered to assist Pakistan's economic development efforts in the FATA and to provide training and rapid strike capabilities as it realigns its military tactics.  15. (C) In the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings, President Musharraf cracked down on terrorist/extremist organizations in Pakistan to much public fanfare.  We are still assessing whether the President has the will to hold the line against Pakistan's extremist elements for the long run.  Initial law enforcement actions targeted the usual suspects--conservative clerics and Islamist politicians--prompting a strong popular backlash, with conservatives decrying the focus on Islamists.  Ultimately, the government released most detainees and watered down regulations intended to provide transparency on madrassa operations.  We have repeatedly pressed senior GOP officials to act decisively against the operational leaders of key terrorist and extremist groups, including those involved in earthquake relief efforts in northern Pakistan.  We have also encouraged GOP officials to take action against madrassas that support, recruit for, or shelter these organizations.  Balochistan ----------- 16. (S) Pakistani leaders are also struggling to cope with an insurgency in the resource-rich province of Balochistan, as local Baloch tribesmen seek to redress historic grievances  ISLAMABAD 00007629  004.2 OF 005   against Pakistan and seize a greater share of their provincial patrimony.  President Musharraf has swung back and forth between civilian advisors who are counseling a negotiated settlement, and military advisors who view the insurgency as an Indian-sponsored threat to national unity that must be suppressed. At the moment, the pendulum appears ready to swing toward the military option. This has clear implications for the military's ability to pursue shared U.S.-Pakistan objectives in the FATA and in the war on terror.  Pakistani security forces are already over-stretched along the Afghan border, in North and South Waziristan, and in managing periodic domestic civil unrest such as the cartoon controversy and sectarian tension.  An escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year.  Pakistan Air Force Command Change --------------------------------- 17. (U) Recently, the Pakistan Air Force has undergone a leadership change with the appointment of Chief Air Marshal Tanvir to the Chief of the Air Staff position and Air Marshal Shahid to the directors Chief of the Air Staff or Operations position.  Security Assistance:  F-16s, C-130s and Joint Exercises --------------------------------------------- ----------  18.  (C) The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is obsessed with F-16s.  The Ministry of Defense for Production (MODP) submitted restated Letters of Requests for new F-16s (18 with an option for an additional 18 aircraft), Mid-Life Upgrade of Pakistan's existing fleet of 34 F-16 aircraft, 26 Used Block 15 F-16s (preferably Peace Gate III/IV aircraft), and a weapons package.  The requested configuration of the new F-16's is: JDAM, AMRAAM, LINK-16, and APG-68(V) 9 radar.  The new-buy program, MLU, and weapons packages are fairly well understood; for the used aircraft LOR, however, there is no DOD position on the availability of used Block 15 F-16s (especially former Peace Gate aircraft) for EDA transfers.  The request for used F-16 represents the GOP's desire to acquire aircraft at an extreme discount.  The GOP remains fixated on the 26 aircraft produced under the Peace Gate III/IV programs, but not delivered to Pakistan due to sanctions (even though a formal settlement was reached with the GOP).  These 26 aircraft are currently in the Air Force (test and evaluation) and Navy (aggressor aircraft) active duty fleet and any transfer would require replacements to fill assigned missions.  19.  (C) The Pakistan Air Force recently concluded a financing deal completing the Swedish Erie-Eye Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft.  While the PAF submitted requests for U.S. AEW platforms, the requests never focused on releasable weapon systems (Wedgetail) or focused on AEW systems the PAF previously rejected (E2C).  The Pakistan Navy is procuring P-3B AEW aircraft.  20. (C)  The C-130 program, worth USD 75 million, will deliver 6 refurbished C-130 aircraft to the GOP, ultimately increasing Pakistan's C-130 fleet to 11 aircraft. Both Air Chief Marshal Tanvir and Air Marshal Shahid are satisfied with the direct engagement of senior USG officials with Lockheed Martin corporate officals regarding the continued failure to meet interim and delivery milestones.  Recently, Lockheed Martin met with SAF/IA to explain how it will deliver the remaining four aircraft by the end of December 2006.  As background, Prime Minister Aziz expressed concerns about the program to the Secretary of Defense in December, which were underscored by the former Chief of the Pakistan Air Force, Chief Air Marshal Sadat, at the Singapore Air Show. The program is approximately one year behind schedule.  Until recently, Lockheed Martin failed to commit sufficient resources to meet restated delivery commitments.  While Lockheed Martin is hitting interim milestones, both the PAF and the USG and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  The second C-130 was delivered to the Government of Pakistan mid-April 2006.  21. (SBU) Joint Exercise Falcon Talon was considered a huge success by the Pakistan Air Force.  This represented the  ISLAMABAD 00007629  005.3 OF 005   first USAF and PAF exercise held in Pakistan.  The exercise consisted of 6 USAF F-16 aircraft and 8 F-16, 16 Mirage, and 6 F-7 aircraft.  The Pakistan Air Force has a significant military to military engagement program.  The Pakistan Air Staff was extremely pleased with the recent Combat Search and Rescue and F-16 engagements and is looking forward to the upcoming Flight Safety, Tactical Airspace Management/Air Traffic Control, Electronic Intelligence, and T-37 engagements.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 007770  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2016 TAGS: PREL, MARR, PK, SA SUBJECT: PRINCE SULTAN'S VISIT TO PAKISTAN: MOSTLY OPTICS; MAYBE DEFENSE SALES  REF: STATE 58668  Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b.   1.  (C)  Summary.  In the week following Crown Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud's April visit to Pakistan, PolCouns sought assessments in separate meetings with the MFA Director General for the Gulf region Sajjad Haider, Saudi Embassy DCM Abdullah Al-Omari and a respected local journalist, Farhan Bokhari (strictly protect).   While MFA and Saudi Embassy officials sought to play down the significance of the visit, the journalist, citing an inside source, said that in fact there had been substantive discussions of security issues, including a possible sale to the Saudis of 150 Al Khalid battle tanks and 12-15 K-8 trainer aircraft. This was Prince Sultan's first visit to Pakistan since becoming Crown Prince, and it came as the last leg of a three-nation tour that included Japan and Singapore.  The stop-over followed an official visit by Saudi King Abdullah in February -- an inaugural tour abroad as Saudi King that took him to China, India, Malaysia and Pakistan.  End Summary  2  (C) Haider characterized the trip as a routine stopover, with no agreements signed and no significant policy developments.  It was "mostly symbolic" he said.   Unlike King Abdullah's visit, this had not been an extravaganza. Following Sultan's arrival, President Musharraf had met with him for a one-on-one, then hosted him for dinner and for an evening of entertainment.  The following day, Prime Minister Aziz hosted him for lunch, and Sultan flew out that afternoon. The Saudi delegation had not included the Saudi Foreign Minister nor any noteworthy officials, other than the Prince himself (who also served as Saudi Defense Minister). "It was all princes, but minor princes," Haider explained. Though he was not privy to what had transpired in the meeting with Musharraf, Haider said that in other meetings the sides had discussed extremism, Pakistan-India relations, terrorism, economic relations, prospects for Saudi investment and issues relating to the 1.1 million Pakistani workers in Saudi Arabia.  3.  (C) Al-Omari echoed Haider's assessment, downplaying the significance of the visit and saying that the stopover had been an afterthought.  Originally, the Prince had planned to visit Japan and Singapore only, but the stopover had been tacked on to address Pakistani dismay following King Abdullah's much-heralded visit to India in late January. Sultan sought to reassure the Pakistanis that Saudi relations with India would not interfere with its long-standing friendship with Pakistan.  (At the same time, Al-Omari explained, the Saudis maintain very good relations with India, which was a major market for Saudi oil.)  As for the meetings themselves, the Pakistanis were looking to promote trade and investment and wanted to explore whether earthquake survivors could be offered employment opportunities in the Saudi Arabia. Defense issues had not been discussed, and no joint statement had been released.  4. (C)  Bokhari, who writes for the Financial Times, reported that he had been told by a source privy to the Musharraf-Sultan meeting that, in fact, defense issues had been discussed at some length.  He observed that this was to be expected, as Sultan was Saudi Defense Minister.  He claimed that Musharraf was pursuing the sale of 150 Pakistani-made Al Khalid main battle tanks to the Saudis for $600 million.   According to Bokhari, approximately half this amount would amount to a Saudi subsidy for the Pakistani defense industry -- an industry in which the Saudis had, he posited, a strategic interest.  Secondly, Musharraf had hoped to offer training in special operations to the Saudis, and perhaps to provide actual Special Operations Task Force units that could be deployed at sensitive oil installations or in Dhamam province.  Third, the Pakistanis had hoped to sell the Saudis a dozen or more K-8 trainer aircraft.  Bokhari believed that the two sides had reached an agreement on the Al Khalid tanks, but not on the other two items.  While military sales had been the focus, according to Bokhari, economic issues had also been discussed, as the Pakistanis were eager for Saudi investment on the Balochistan coast.   Comment -------  ISLAMABAD 00007770  002 OF 002    5. (C) The Pakistanis have been pushing the Al-Khalid and K-8 sales for a while, hoping they might break the ice for sales to cost-conscious buyers in the developing world. We are aware that the Pakistanis also took Prince Sultan's delegation to visit production facilities, which suggests that they are still at the marketing stage and haven't yet finalized a deal.  The Saudis, of course, already have access to much better (U.S.) equipment, so any purchase from the Pakistanis would be a goodwill gesture and lend some credence to Bokhari's thesis that the Saudis have a strategic interest in sustaining the arms industry in a friendly and nearby Islamic state. Musharraf's reported offer of special forces training or personnel would be surprising; the performance of Pakistani special forces in Waziristan suggests that they are still on the steep end of the learning curve.

(U) See action request at para 5.  2.  (C) Polcouns delivered reftel demarche in a meeting with MFA Director General for Disarmament Qazi Khalilullah and Director for Disarmament Kamran Aktar, urging that Pakistan endorse PSI Interdiction Principles as a precursor to participation in the June Senior Level Political meeting on PSI hosted by Poland.  Khalilullah underscored that Pakistan shared the nonproliferation objectives but had questions about the Statement of Interdiction Principles, particularly as they related to interdiction on the high seas.  The principles were "a bit vague" he said, and "did not appear consistent with the law of the sea."  He hoped for engagement with the U.S.  3.  (C) With respect to the June meeting in Poland, Khalilullah asked whether Pakistan could be invited as an observer.  Pakistanis had participated as observers in PSI exercises, including exercises in Singapore in August 2005 and Darwin, Australia in April 2006.  Polcouns explained that endorsement of the interdiction principles was a precondition of participation in the June meeting, noting that Pakistan's request to participate as an observer in the 2004 meeting in Krakow had been denied.  Polcouns observed that a request to participate as an observer would be interpreted in Washington as a refusal to endorse the Interdiction Principles. Khalilullah undertook to reexamine Pakistan's stance.  4.  (C) In a follow-up meeting on April 28 with Polcouns, Additional Secretary Tariq Osman Hyder confirmed that Pakistan was not yet prepared to endorse the PSI statement of interdiction principles, but hoped for an opportunity to participate as an observer in the June meeting.  He noted that Pakistan was "in line with PSI" goals, and was prepared to act within Pakistan's own "maritime area."  With respect to interdiction on the high seas, Pakistan was prepared to engage and discuss the issue.  5.  (C) Embassy requests Department guidance on whether Pakistan could participate as an observer in the June meeting.  Embassy also stands ready to pass to the Pakistanis any guidance Department might provide that would clarify PSI obligations relating to interdiction on the high seas and the consonance of these obligations with the law of the sea.

NORTH'S VISIT TO PAKISTAN  Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Peter W.Bodde, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1. (S) The U.S. Mission in Pakistan warmly welcomes your May visit to Pakistan.  As demonstrated during President Bush's visit to Islamabad, both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz are western-oriented modernizers who are trying to move Pakistan toward Musharraf's goal of "enlightened moderation." They viewed the President's visit as a landmark in the relationship and were gratified that he decided to stay overnight in Pakistan.  Your visit comes as Pakistan's leaders have weathered the fallout from the Danish cartoon controversy, but continue to be challenged by violent separatists in Balochistan, al-Qa'ida and extremists in the tribal areas along the Afghan border, and the transition from earthquake relief operations to long-term reconstruction. Robust USG participation in the earthquake relief effort has promoted a more positive public perception of the United States, but Pakistan remains a tough public diplomacy environment.  We believe that your visit will help advance key U.S. objectives, including democratization, regional stability, and progress in the global war on terror.  U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Partnership ----------------------------------- 2. (S) During his March visit to Pakistan, President Bush launched a U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Partnership.  This initiative has been institutionalized in the framework of a Strategic Dialogue that incorporates discussions on: economic growth and prosperity, energy cooperation, peace and security, social sector development, science and technology, democracy, and non-proliferation.  In the wake of President Bush's visit, and with the prospect of a U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, Pakistan's political class has been wracked by a bout of insecurity and "me-tooism." Even President Musharraf has complained privately that there is now a public perception that the U.S. is distancing itself from him.  The inaugural meeting of the Strategic Dialogue, which were held in Washington from April 26-27, should help reassure Pakistan of the breadth and depth of our long-term commitment.  The Cartoon Controversy ----------------------- 3. (C) In February and early March, tens of thousands of Pakistani demonstrators took to the streets to protest the publication of the Danish cartoons.  Early rallies in Lahore and Peshawar were particularly destructive, with rampant looting and vandalism in parts of downtown Lahore and Peshawar and six protesters killed.  Although demonstrations followed across Pakistan, enhanced security measures by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) prevented any repetition of the unrestrained violence seen in February.  Over time, the protests took on a greater political tone, as opportunistic politicians sought to embarrass the Musharraf government. The protests have died out following Federal government intervention to quell them.  Your visit presents an opportunity to remind the Pakistani people that the United States understands the sentiments of the Muslim community and that, although we strongly support freedom of expression, we also believe the press should behave responsibly.  Earthquake Relief ----------------- 4. (U) The October 8 earthquake (7.6 on the Richter scale) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was the strongest to hit the region in over a century.  The GOP estimates that more than 73,000 died in the quake, with more than 69,000 wounded and some 2.8 million left homeless.  The United States had been Pakistan's most visible international partner in delivering emergency relief during the sixth month effort.  5. (U) The U.S. military, which had been on the ground since October 10, concluded its relief operations on March 31.  At the peak of initial relief efforts, more than 1,200 personnel and 24 helicopters provided vital transport, logistics, and medical and engineering support in affected areas.  As we wrapped up our military relief operations, we donated more than USD 2.5 million in medical equipment to Pakistani counterparts.  Our Seabee unit also left behind 25 pieces of heavy construction equipment as a donation to Pakistani military engineers.  ISLAMABAD 00007780  002 OF 005    6. (U) The U.S. military and USAID collaborated closely on the civilian relief effort, with the military providing logistics and USAID working with NGOs to deliver supplies and services to camps and villages.  USAID provided more than USD 60 million in additional humanitarian assistance through NGOs and the United Nations, including the donation of blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter kits to the affected population.  In March, USAID made its first reconstruction grant of USD 15 million to rebuild schools and hospitals.  In total, the USG has pledged USD 510 million for earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts.  The U.S. private sector is also engaged.  A consortium of CEOs (GE, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS) is spearheading the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund, which has already attracted approximately USD 24 million.  Independent estimates place total U.S. private donations at over USD 130 million.  7. (C) Our prompt and generous response sparked a perceptible shift in Pakistani attitudes about the United States that has improved bilateral relations at official levels.  The cooperation between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel has palpably reduced suspicions at the middle and upper ranks of the Pakistani army.  Throughout the draw-down of our military presence, we emphasized that our transition parallels the shift from emergency relief toward the civilian reconstruction phase of the recovery effort.

Pakistani security forces are already over-stretched along the Afghan border, in North and South Waziristan, and in managing periodic domestic civil unrest such as the cartoon controversy and sectarian tension.  An escalation in armed conflict in Balochistan would create an inauspicious political environment in the run-up to national elections next year.  Pakistan Air Force Command Change --------------------------------- 17. (U) Recently, the Pakistan Air Force has undergone a leadership change with the appointment of Chief Air Marshal Tanvir to the Chief of the Air Staff position and Air Marshal Shahid to the directors Chief of the Air Staff or Operations position.  Security Assistance:  F-16s, C-130s and Joint Exercises --------------------------------------------- ----------  18.  (C) The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is obsessed with F-16s.  The Ministry of Defense for Production (MODP) submitted restated Letters of Requests for new F-16s (18 with an option for an additional 18 aircraft), Mid-Life Upgrade of Pakistan's existing fleet of 34 F-16 aircraft, 26 Used Block 15 F-16s (preferably Peace Gate III/IV aircraft), and a weapons package.  The requested configuration of the new F-16's is: JDAM, AMRAAM, LINK-16, and APG-68(V) 9 radar.  The new-buy program, MLU, and weapons packages are fairly well understood; for the used aircraft LOR, however, there is no DOD position on the availability of used Block 15 F-16s (especially former Peace Gate aircraft) for EDA transfers.  The request for used F-16 represents the GOP's desire to acquire aircraft at an extreme discount.  The GOP remains fixated on the 26 aircraft produced under the Peace Gate III/IV programs, but not delivered to Pakistan due to sanctions (even though a formal settlement was reached with the GOP).  These 26 aircraft are currently in the Air Force (test and evaluation) and Navy (aggressor aircraft) active duty fleet and any transfer would require replacements to fill assigned missions.  19.  (C) The Pakistan Air Force recently concluded a financing deal completing the Swedish Erie-Eye Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft.  While the PAF submitted requests for U.S. AEW platforms, the requests never focused on releasable weapon systems (Wedgetail) or focused on AEW systems the PAF previously rejected (E2C).  The Pakistan Navy is procuring P-3B AEW aircraft.  20. (C)  The C-130 program, worth USD 75 million, will deliver 6 refurbished C-130 aircraft to the GOP, ultimately increasing Pakistan's C-130 fleet to 11 aircraft. Both Air Chief Marshal Tanvir and Air Marshal Shahid are satisfied with the direct engagement of senior USG officials with Lockheed Martin corporate  ISLAMABAD 00007780  005 OF 005   officals regarding the continued failure to meet interim and delivery milestones.  Recently, Lockheed Martin met with SAF/IA to explain how it will deliver the remaining four aircraft by the end of December 2006.  As background, Prime Minister Aziz expressed concerns about the program to the Secretary of Defense in December, which were underscored by the former Chief of the Pakistan Air Force, Chief Air Marshal Sadat, at the Singapore Air Show. The program is approximately one year behind schedule.  Until recently, Lockheed Martin failed to commit sufficient resources to meet restated delivery commitments.  While Lockheed Martin is hitting interim milestones, both the PAF and the USG and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  The second C-130 was delivered to the Government of Pakistan mid-April 2006.  21. (SBU) Joint Exercise Falcon Talon was considered a huge success by the Pakistan Air Force.  This represented the first USAF and PAF exercise held in Pakistan.  The exercise consisted of 6 USAF F-16 aircraft and 8 F-16, 16 Mirage, and 6 F-7 aircraft.  The Pakistan Air Force has a significant military to military engagement program.  The Pakistan Air Staff was extremely pleased with the recent Combat Search and Rescue and F-16 engagements and is looking forward to the upcoming Flight Safety, Tactical Airspace Management/Air Traffic Control, Electronic Intelligence, and T-37 engagements.

(A) ISLAMABAD 5364       B. (B) ISLAMABAD 4595      C. ISLAMABAD 4347  ISLAMABAD 00008148  001.2 OF 005   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d.  1. (C)  Summary:  With the appointment of a credible, permanent Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), Pakistan is moving in the necessary direction for free and fair elections in 2007.  Post believes that the credibility of the 2007 contest has significant implications for long-term stability and democratization.  A free and fair contest will set the stage to begin significant long-term investment in the strengthening of democratic institutions and the exit of the military from elected politics.  Rigged elections will only serve to increase public ire at the current government, weaken its ability to pursue necessary policies, and undermine the credibility of the USG commitment to democracy in the region.  For these reasons, post has elaborated a comprehensive assistance strategy matching technical assistance, diplomatic engagement, and public diplomacy programming directly to what we view as key election obstacles.  Post appreciates Washington agencies' careful review of this strategy, provision of the identified programmatic resources, and engagement with key non-governmental agencies and other international donors. End Summary.  2. (C) The upcoming national elections are a critical benchmark in Pakistan's democratic development.  They will mark the final transition back to full civilian rule following the 1999 coup and will lay the groundwork for the country's future political evolution.  Opposition parties, civil society, and the central government are all placing significant emphasis on the need for these elections to be free and fair -- a marked departure from Pakistan's history of controlled democracy.  Achieving elections that major parties accept as a genuine representation of the will of the Pakistani people will provide the new, likely progressive, government with a heretofore absent public mandate.  This will enable it to tackle forthrightly the domestic and international challenges facing Pakistan, consolidate democratic institutions, and make progress towards civilian control over the military.  Rigged elections will increase opposition to the Musharraf government, fuel public unrest and provincial insurgencies, and weaken the GOP's ability to undertake controversial policies.  In a worst case scenario, united opposition protests over elections could topple the GOP, leading to a coalition arrangement in which Islamist parties would have greatly increased influence.  While post believes that the GOP is committed to organizing a reasonably free and fair contest, international technical assistance, election monitoring, and continuous diplomatic engagement will be essential to overcome long-standing obstacles and ensure public confidence in the process.  Electoral Set-Up  3. (C) The Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) credibility may be at an all-time low.  Its last three  ISLAMABAD 00008148  002.2 OF 005   attempts to organize national elections (2002 referendum, 2002 national elections, 2005 local elections) were failures.  The recent appointment of a permanent CEC is a necessary but not a sufficient step to restore credibility.  Pakistani law does not provide sufficient independence or authority to the ECP to carry out its mandate, and there is no tradition of regular consultation between the ECP and political parties. A number of outstanding issues need to be addressed relating to the overall electoral set-up such as whether or not a caretaker government will be appointed, the return of opposition party leaders, and delimitation of electoral districts.  Regularized engagement between the CEC and the heads of all major political parties would create the necessary framework.  To that end, post is proposing assistance for the formation of a consultative forum to which we would provide international expertise.  The initial focus would be on revision of electoral laws and regulations to empower the ECP and address outstanding structural issues. The forum would then focus on development of a universally acceptable Electoral Code of Conduct and resolution of disputes during the nomination, campaign, and election process.  4. (C) Technical considerations also hamper the ECP's effectiveness.  The ECP requires fully-staffed provincial and district offices that are empowered to pursue aggressively suspected election violations and adjudicate such violations in a timely and impartial manner.  The previous reliance on judicial personnel is insufficient and creates a conflict of interest as the judiciary is expected to rule on its own personnel's decisions during election appeals.  Adequate training of polling staff has also been a critical problem. Early identification and in-depth training on simplified electoral procedures needs to occur.  Coupled with this, enhanced voter training, appropriate for a largely illiterate population, is required.  Donor support will be necessary to address these concerns and leverage GOP resources.  Public Confidence  5. (C) Rebuilding shattered public credibility will be key to ensuring significant voter participation. Consistent allegations of rigging have led to a perception that government personnel occasionally stuff ballot boxes or otherwise change electoral results.  This is in addition to the more frequent allegations of pre-poll rigging, voter intimidation, and other forms of coercive support. Monitoring by local NGOs coupled with selective observation by international donors and NGOs has not ended these practices.  Transparent ballot boxes and appropriate voting screens, as used in Afghanistan, would increase the difficulty in carrying out fraud and would help increase voter confidence.  We also believe that a significant investment in nationwide international observation from nomination through appeal of results coupled with a parallel vote count in each district is essential to address these questions.  To avoid competing programs and assessments, post strongly recommends a single joint observation mission in coordination with other donors.   ISLAMABAD 00008148  003.2 OF 005   Voter Lists  6. (C) Pakistan's voter lists are in a state of complete disarray.  Initial lists prepared in 2000 for the local bodies elections remain highly controversial with opposition parties charging that their supporters were deliberately omitted.  The 2002 amendments to those lists are even more controversial such that they were not even utilized in the 2005 local bodies contests.  The CEC in his initial meeting with the Ambassador made clear that entirely new lists were required.  For this to be an effective exercise, the ECP will require extensive assistance in how to carry out a credible non-partisan process.  Considerable training of registration personnel coupled with assistance in computerization of the new lists so that they can easily be updated is needed.  Intelligence/Security Agencies  7. (S)  The involvement of security agencies in elections has been pervasive.  Intelligence agencies have supported candidates and parties for elections and have engaged in candidate and voter intimidation.  Organized voting fraud supported by these agencies has changed results in certain districts.  Significant donor pressure during the 2005 local elections was generally effective in keeping intelligence agencies out of the electoral process.  A similar, unified intervention will be necessary for 2007.  With the withdrawal of intelligence agencies in 2005, provincial governments utilized police to carry out many of the same fraudulent activities.  Coordinated engagement with the national and provincial government on the police role in the electoral process will be important.  We also believe that direct training in election security for police at the district level can help to avert future misbehavior and, at the same time, decrease violence at the polls.  Political Parties  8. (C) Pakistan's political parties have no concept of issues-based campaigning.  Their electoral campaigns tend to revolve around personalities and mud-slinging.  Grass-roots involvement in the development of party platforms is non-existent and the selection of candidates is a highly-controversial, non-democratic exercise.  Post believes that continued work is crucial if we are to build a better electoral system.  The National Democratic Institute is currently working with the parties to develop younger leadership talent and to build democratic mechanisms. Its program will conclude in early 2007, and we do not/not believe that an extension is warranted given that parties will be exclusively focused on electioneering by that time. The International Republican Institute (IRI) is currently concluding a small pilot program on electoral polling and issues development funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  We believe that additional programming through 2007 is warranted.  FATA  9. (C) Conduct of national elections in the Federally  ISLAMABAD 00008148  004.2 OF 005   Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) will continue to mark a significant challenge for the GOP.  Aside from obvious security issues, the FATA has a very brief history of electoral politics, low voter turn-out rates particularly among women, and a bar on political party work (a bar routinely flouted by the Islamist parties that use the mullahs as their agents).  Engagement at the senior levels of the GOP will be critical to lift the bar on political party activity to allow elections to be contested in a manner equal to other areas of the country.  This will allow secular parties to compete, for the first time, on an equal footing with their Islamist rivals.  In addition, voter education work, particularly among women, will be vital to ensure a higher turn-out and a better informed electorate.  Existing Resources  10. (SBU)  USAID has identified $16 million in FY 06 DG funds for election-related activities.  A request for proposals has already gone out to IQC holders to utilize this existing funding for the following activities:      -- Revision of voter roles     -- Creation of a forum between political parties and the ECP to review election laws, regulations, and procedures,        draft a joint Electoral Code of Conduct; and serve as a dispute resolution forum during the election process.     -- Purchase transparent ballot boxes and voting screens for the ECP  On the political party front, USAID's $1.7 million program on strengthening political parties through the National Democratic Institute will continue through February 2007.  A portion of this program focuses on election-related issues. NED's $500,000 program through the International Republican Institute on polling and issues-based platform development will conclude in September 2006.  IIP has agreed to finance two additional Speaker's programs in FY 2006.  The first of these would organize public discussion on reforms to electoral laws and procedures.  The second would work with political parties on organization of campaigns and selection of candidates.  At this stage, no other donors have made definitive commitments on elections.  Local British, Canadian, and EU missions have indicated a willingness to fund some training of ECP staff, while Nordic countries, Switzerland, and Canada are interested in funding voter education.  Needed Funding  11. (SBU) Post believes that additional funding needs to be rapidly identified and made available for full implementation of our election support strategy.  Post requires an additional $13 million in FY 07 funding to support training of ECP staff, establishment of district offices, and post-election analysis and follow-up.  Only $3 million of that has been firmly identified by USAID.  In addition, as indicated reftels, post requires approximately $20 million for nationwide international monitoring and a parallel vote tabulation; $1 million for voter education in the FATA; and  ISLAMABAD 00008148  005.2 OF 005   $250,000 for training of district police officers in election security.  We had originally requested that such funds be made available through DRL.  We understand, however, that HRDF funds may not/not be sufficient.  For this reason, post requests that new resources from a combination of sources (USAID, HRDF, and ESF) be identified for these activities. Additional IIP support for election-related speakers will also be required in FY 2007 on such topics as media coverage of election campaigns.  We understand that IRI will be submitting an unsolicited proposal to USAID to continue work on polling and issues-based platform development with political parties.  Post strongly supports this initiative and recommends funding.  In addition to USG support, immediate engagement with like-minded donors to support voter education (Nordics, Benelux, Germany, and EU), a single, comprehensive international election monitoring mission (Canada, Britain, EU, Switzerland, Nordics, Australia, Japan, Germany, France, Benelux), training of ECP and polling staff (Britain, EU, Canada), and FATA voter education (Japan).  Comment  12.  (C)  While there are significant obstacles, post remains convinced that a generally free and fair election can be achieved in Pakistan in 2007.  To do so, however, we and other international donors must be prepared to commit significant resources early-on in the process in order to shift a non-permissive electoral environment.  To date, every other major donor in Pakistan is well behind us on electoral planning, a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue if we are to achieve the progress that we desire. Post will continue to press like-minded donors through the existing working group on elections, but we believe that absent engagement with capitals and Washington progress will be slow.  Post welcomes Washington assistance in overcoming this obstacle and building the needed international coalition to support elections in Pakistan. BODDE

Post welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Gov. Mitt Romney, Gov. Matt Blunt, Gov. Mark Sanford, Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Anthony Welcher, Dan Wilmot, Ltc. Kurt Vogel, Capt. Ernest Barringer, Eddie Johnson, Barbara Davis, and Maj. Matt Green for May 25 and 26.  The purpose of the visit is to transit Pakistan en route to and from Afghanistan.  2.  Control officer for the visit will be Political Officer, Mohammed Motiwala.  He can be reached at the following numbers: Embassy: 92-51-208-0000; Office: 92-51-208-2624; Cell: 0300-501-2202.  3.  The control officer will meet visitors upon arrival at the airport in Islamabad.  Please inform control officer of any change in itinerary.  4.   Visitors must/must obtain separate post clearance if they plan to visit any of the three Mission Pakistan consulates (Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore) or any other areas under the jurisdiction of the consulates.  Most travel outside of Islamabad will require separate post clearance. Post clearance for the consulates should be requested via cable to the consulate(s) on the planned itinerary.  5. Visas: Unless only transiting Pakistan, everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  6.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  7.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  8.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section, or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  9.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  10.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  11. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services:  NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED).  TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.  CROCKER 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 008829  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  KABUL - PLEASE PASS TO CFC-A  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2016 TAGS: MASS, MCAP, MOPS, PGOV, PK, PREL, PTER SUBJECT: S/CT AMB CRUMPTON ENCOURAGES ROBUST GOP COUNTERTERRORISM ACTION   Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  Introduction and summary:  Visiting Islamabad on May 3-4, S/CT Ambassador Henry Crumpton and S/CT Senior Advisor Michael Hurley engaged political, diplomatic and military interlocutors on Pakistan's counterterrorim (CT) strategies and policies.  Calling on National Security Advisor Tariq Aziz, Foreign Secretary Mohammad Riaz Khan and Director - Military Operations BG Nasser Janjua, Crumpton commended his interlocutors on Pakistan's political commitment to the Global War on Terror (GWOT) and queried them on the government's CT priorities.  Tariq Aziz and BG Nasser described in detail the GOP's three-tiered strategy for denying Islamic extremists safe haven in the tribal areas along the Pak-Afghan border.  Tariq Aziz indicated his willingness to work with he Afghan counterpart to identify tribal leaders that could restore stability to the region, and reaffirmed the GOP's support for Afghanistan's political development.  He shared his assessment that a military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran would seriously destabilize Pakistan and the region, and said that President Musharraf was grateful for President Bush's comments on Kashmir during his March 2005 visit to Islamabad.  ForSec Riaz Khan also discussed GOP policies toward the FATA, but was stumped when AMB Crumpton asked about the Foreign Office's top priorities for advancing CT policy.  BG Nasser presented a detailed briefing on the army's military operations in the tribal areas, agreeing with AMB Crumpton that the success of the GOP's counter-insurgency strategy rests as  much on progress on political integration and economic and social development as on military victory. End summary and introduction.  (Note:  AMB Crumpton's meeting with Pakistan Interior Minister Sherpao will be reported septel.  End note.)  NSA Tariq Aziz --------------  2. (C)  AMB Crumpton underscored for Tariq Aziz the importance the U.S. attaches to the bilateral relationship, including cooperation on CT.  Aziz stressed the importance of understanding the root causes of terrorism throughout the Moslem world and the need to combat it with both political and military actions.  Aziz has advised the British, as they prepare to move into Afghanistan,s Helmand province, to revive tactics from their imperial past and work as much as possible through locally dominant proxies.  The important thing, he explained, is to avoid taking unnecessary British casualties, which might create domestic pressure in the UK to pull troops out.  Pakistan opposed to a premature withdrawal of UK or U.S. forces from Afghanistan; it is essential that the coalition succeed, but succeed sooner rather than later.  3. (C)  Turning to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Aziz said a multifaceted FATA Development Plan was under development, but the government had not yet made a final determination on who should lead the effort.  The leader should be a Pashtun familiar with the local environment, he added.  Former Chief Secretary of the NWFP Sahibzada Imtiaz was a good bureaucrat, with a lot of experience and a reputation for honesty, but had not been definitively selected for the position  4. (C)  When Aziz asked whether the U.S. was satisfied with Pakistan,s performance in the war on terror, Ambassador Crumpton assured him that there was no question as to Pakistan,s political commitment, adding that no country had captured or killed more Al Qaida operatives.  Aziz noted that Pakistan is under tremendous pressure from terrorists, but that President Musharraf was convinced that fighting terrorists vigorously was in Pakistan,s own interest.  ISLAMABAD 00008829  002 OF 003   Responding to AMB Crumpton, Aziz confirmed that Pakistan was getting necessary support from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others, as the Gulf countries shared Pakistan,s concerns regarding the spread of Al Qaida.  5.  (C)  The challenge in Waziristan was exacerbated, Aziz said, by the assimilation of foreign elements into local tribal societies:  it is not uncommon now for Waziri tribal elders to have grandchildren born to foreign militants, who remained in the area after the anti-Soviet jihad and married local women.  These family ties created deep loyalties.  Aziz hoped that Asfandyar Wali Khan, leader of the Awami National Party (ANP) and scion of a renowned Pushtoon nationalist family, could play a helpful role, explaining that the ANP had ties on both sides of the border.  The ANP was "totally moderate" and "anti-Mullah"; because of its deeper ties in the region, it was better equipped than the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML) to serve as a moderating influence.  6.  (S)  Aziz reported that Afghan National Security Advisor Zalmay Rassoul had called recently to say the two should "be in touch with each other."   It was in Pakistan,s national interest that Afghanistan succeed, Aziz added.  Pakistan could not accept the reinvigoration of the Taliban.  Although the message "may not have filtered down," Aziz said that President Musharraf had opposed the Taliban even before 9/11.  Unfortunately Northern Alliance elements in Afghanistan doubted Pakistan,s anti-Taliban credentials.  Aziz agreed that he and Rassoul should meet to discuss these issues; he endorsed AMB Crumpton,s suggestion that the two could "compare notes" on tribal leaders on both sides of the border that could serve as common allies.  Aziz said that he and Rassoul could perhaps identify influential leaders, give them responsibility to police their areas, supply them with weapons and hold them accountable.  Cash was often a very effective inducement to cooperation, he observed, and if 30-40 percent of it was "pocketed" by these influential leaders, then it was a small price to pay and should be overlooked.  Currently, neither the Afghans nor the Pakistanis had the full support of the local populations, and those that did support them were not properly armed and trained.  7.  (C)  Aziz expressed concern about the fallout in Pakistan from the "Iran situation," especially in view of Pakistani elections scheduled for 2007.  Military action against Iran would pose and enormous political challenge for Musharraf, he said.  It would be exploited by Mullahs, who would argue that Pakistan was next in line after Iran.  However, sanctions against Iran would be "livable" he judged.  Aziz promised to think about what role Pakistan could play in Iran, but he explained that the current leader of Iran had "gone mad" and it was unclear that he would listen to Musharraf, who was perceived as pro-western.  8.  (C)  Aziz said that President Bush,s visit had gone well -- contrary to popular perceptions -- and that Pakistan welcomed the President,s comments on Kashmir.  He asserted that Pakistan wanted an "honorable exit" from Kashmir.  "We don,t want territory; we want a resolution of the conflict."  Aziz concluded by stressing, the importance of continuity and stability in the U.S. Pakistan relationship going beyond the war on terror.  "We have a perception that when you are done, you,ll leave us high and dry," he said.  It was in the U.S. interest to counter this perception because for decades to come Pakistan would remain strategically significant -- "either as a problem or as an asset."  Foreign Secretary Muhammad Riaz Khan ------------------------------------  9.  (C)  Introducing himself to ForSec Riaz Khan, AMB  ISLAMABAD 00008829  003 OF 003   Crumpton expressed appreciation for excellent bilateral CT cooperation, which the USG would like to expand.  Responding to AMB Crumpton's comment that his key concern is eliminating the safe haven along the Pak-Afghan border that is exploited by al Qaidaa and Taliban forces, the ForSec noted that this is also a key GOP concern.  Reviewing the legacy of the anti-Soviet jihad and subsequent years of turmoil in Afghanistan, Riaz Khan called for greater cooperation between Islamabad and Kabul to stabilize the border area.  Noting the three-tier strategy for the FATA advanced by President Musharraf, the ForSec urged the U.S, to move quickly on Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) to accelerate economic development along the border.  Riaz Khan was at a loss for a quick response, however, when AMB Crumpton asked him to describe the MFA's priorities for advancing Pakistan's CT objectives; he said only that the Foreign Office plays a traditional role in facilitating bilateral dialogue and arrangements (e.g., extradition treaties) in support of broader GOP CT goals.  Director - Military Operations BG Nasser Janjua --------------------------------------------- --  10.  (C)  BG Nasser Janjua presented a detailed briefing on the Pakistan Army's strategy and tactics for combating al Qaida, Taliban and other violent extremists in the FATA. (Note:  Embassy will forward an electronic copy of BG Nasser's full presentation to S/CT.  End note.)   AMB Crumpton was particularly interested in Pak mil tactics for managing the broader counter-insurgency campaign;  BG Nasser responded by describing the deep tribal loyalties and traditions that present a serious challenge to stabilizing the region, as the mere presence of 80,000 Pakostani troops on tribal lands is considered an affront to tribal sovereignty.  This prolonged military presence, along with collateral civilian casualties search-and-destroy operations, are being exploited by al Qaida and Taliban forces, who engage in assassination campaigns against tribal leaders who cooperate with GOP authorities.  Human intelligence collection is particularly difficult, BG Nasser noted, as potential sources are well aware of the potential for quick, lethal reprisal.  BG Nasser said CENTCOM, with whom Pak mil works hand-in-glove, knows that the GOP has made a serious commitment to dislodge Islamic militants from the FATA.  He was concerned that, during a recent visit to Washington, he sensed that this commitment was not recognized by civilian USG officials.  AMB Crumpton noted that the State Department's 2005 Country Report on Terrorism highlights Pakistan's strong performance in the GWOT, and pledged that he would always be clear when speaking of the U.S.-Pakistani CT partnership.  The meeting concluded with AMB Crumpton and BG Nasser agreeing that the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan should work to identify tribal leaders who could advance common counter-insurgency objectives.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1. (S)  Prior to his departure to the D-8 Summit in Bali last week, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told the Ambassador that he and Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan would be meeting with Iranian President Ahmedinejad and asked if we had any advice.  As conveyed to SCA and NEA Ambassador told Aziz that we hoped that, as two of Iran's most powerful neighbors, he and his Turkish colleague would make clear to the Iranian President that he is isolated in the region, as well as internationally, and is following a course that is dangerously destabilizing for the area.  They had an excellent offer from the EU-3.  Aziz, who is on an extended trip abroad, said that he would have Foreign Minister Kasuri provide a read-out upon Kasuri's return from Bali.  2.  (S)  On May 17, FM Kasuri described the exchange with Ahmedinejad at the D-8 Summit to the Ambassador.  According to Kasuri, PM Aziz and Turkish PM Erdogan met privately with President Ahmedinejad, conveying a direct message that Tehran must change course regarding its nuclear program, as the current direction was neither in Iran's nor the region's interest.  Aziz and Erdogan described the current EU-3 proposal, with Russian enhancements, as a very attractive offer for Iran; Tehran should accept it and forego it's weapons program.  Aziz and Erdogan also condemned Ahmedinejad's statements attacking Israel as completely unacceptable and serving no purpose, citing the Ahmedinejad's description of Shimon Perez as a modern Hitler as particularly offensive.  3.  (S)  FM Kasuri, who did not participate in the Aziz-Erdogan-Ahmedinejad meeting, said that Ahmedinejad assured Aziz and Erdogan that Iran is a peaceful nation that will consider any reasonable way forward.  The Iranian president said that he is ready to work with the international community to strengthen the NPT and will consider any suggestions toward that end.  4.  (S)  FM Kasuri told the Ambassador that PM Aziz believes that Iran is looking for a face-saving way out of its present predicament, even though Ahmedinejad did not say this explicitly.  Aziz urged Ahmedinejad to publicly announce that Iran would immediately place a moratorium on uranium enrichment, in order to give the EU-3 an opening to re-engage Tehran in constructive dialogue. Ahmedinejad did not reject this suggestion.  5.  (S)  Offering his personal assessment following the Aziz-Erdogan intervention in Bali and his own encounter with the Iranian FM at the May 5 Economic Cooperation Organization meeting in Baku, Kasuri believes that Iran seriously wants a dialogue with the U.S., seeing it as a possible way out of the corner into which it has painted itself.  Kasuri concluded by noting that the continuing controversy over Tehran's nuclear program is deeply troubling to Pakistan, as any overt action against Iran would be devastating for Pakistan's internal security.

Akhtar said that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) would welcome the start of serious negotiations on the FMCT and looked forward to working with the United States in the negotiations.  Akhtar also indicated that verification is very important to the GOP:  given the current state of bilateral relations between Pakistan and India, each country would be suspicious of the other's compliance if there was no international mechanism for verification.  Akhtar stressed that the GOP's concerns regarding verification are specifically based on these regional considerations. CROCKER

Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (S)  During a May 22 conversation, National Security Advisor Tariq Aziz told Ambassador that Pakistan's senior leaders are increasingly concerned by both the security situation in Afghanistan and by public accusations by Afghanistan President Karzai and Foreign Minister Spanta blaming Pakistan for the surge in Taliban attacks on Afghan and Coalition forces.  Presidential Chief of Staff LTG Hamid Javaid and Aziz have counseled an irritated President Musharraf to exercise restraint, to avoid yet another spiral of unhelpful cross-border rhetoric.  2.  (S)  According to Aziz, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) fully appreciates that the situation on the ground is serious, hence President Musharraf's active engagement on Pakistan's three-tiered FATA strategy.  Aziz confirmed that former 11th Corps Commander LTG (ret) Ali Muhammad Jan Orakzai will replace  Khalid ur-Rehman as Governor in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), and that the President is serious about installing new, stronger Political Agents to implement political reforms and engage the tribes on economic and social development.  The Taliban pose the same threat on both sides of the border, Aziz noted, saying that Kabul and Islamabad should cooperate on confronting this common danger.  3.  (S)  The Ambassador suggested that Aziz call Afghan NSA Zalimay Rasool to invite him to Islamabad to brief him on the GOP's FATA strategy and explore coordinated Pak-Afghan action.  Aziz replied that he had considered such a step, but was concerned that, in the current atmosphere, there was too great a chance that President Karzai would prohibit Rasool from accepting Aziz' invitation -- a scenario best avoided, as a rejected invitation would enrage President Musharraf. After the Ambassdor pointed out that it should not be too difficult to manage a phone conversation that avoided such an outcome, Aziz telephoned Afghan Ambassador Tarzi and asked him to set up a telephone consultation with Rasool.  When Tarzi responded that Rasool was with President Karzai in Dubai, Aziz asked that a call be arranged after  Rasool's return to Kabul on May 23.  4.  (S)  Comment:  The steady barrage cross-border criticism targeted at Islamabad the past two weeks neither helps the GOP stabilize the FATA or execute the security operations necessary to deny anti-Coalition militias safe haven along the Pak-Afghan border.  Post believes that the sooner Aziz and Rasool can speak to each other directly, the sooner the two governments can direct their energies toward their common enemy.  Facilitating an Aziz-Rasool telephone call is a first step -- and if Aziz extends an invitation for face-to-face consultations, we hope that Embassy Kabul will encourage Rasool to accept. CROCKER

(U)  Summary.  The Pakistani press has cast reports on the upcoming Composite Dialogue talks on Siachen glacier (May 23-24) and Sir Creek (May 25-26) in a lackluster light, mostly by lifting bylines from the Indian press.  There has been little discussion on what proposals the GOP will bring forth, but much analysis of a perceived divide between the Indian military and Indian PM Manmohan Singh.  Pakistani think-tankers expect the GOP to firmly reject India's demand to verify troop positions in Siachen, believing that India will present a compromise solution on Siachen at the talks this week.  End summary.  2.  (U)  This week's May 23-26 defense-secretary level talks on Siachen and Sir Creek will be held in New Delhi.  The Pakistani delegation will be headed by Defense Secretary Tariq Ghazi.  Accompanying him will be Additional Secretary Muhammad Ashraf Chaudhry and MFA India Director Zaheer Janjua.  Talks on Sir Creek will be headed by Additional Defense Secretary Ehsan-ul Haq Chaudhry.  Though two days are scheduled to discuss Sir Creek, the media's attention has been captured by the possibility of an Indian proposal to demilitarize Siachen.  3.  (U)  The Pakistani English-language press has re-published a variety of Indian articles on the upcoming talks.  Recently, coverage has focused on a perceived divide between the Indian military and PM Manmohan Singh, with predictions that this division could stall forward movement on resolving the Siachen dispute.  One paper, "Dawn," quotes an unnamed senior GOP official who believes the talks will give final shape to a pact agreed upon by officials from both countries during recent "informal talks."  There has been no comment in the press on what stance the GOP delegation will take in New Delhi.  4.  (SBU)  Pakistani experts from three Islamabad think-tanks were overly optimistic about the outcome of the upcoming talks on Siachen.  Khalid Mahmud, Institute of Regional Studies, cited recent Indian acquiescence on the Kishenganga dam design as a sign that India realizes that it must compromise to achieve progress on other, more contentious issues such as Kashmir.  He added that the willingness of PM Singh to take on India's military hawks on the Siachen issue shows that the Indian government is determined to hammer out a solid, workable solution soon.  All three experts interpret recent grumbling by senior GOP officials on the usefulness of the Composite Dialogue process as a factor  pushing the Indians to make concessions.  Tanveer Ahmed Khan, Institute of Strategic Studies, believes the outcome of this week's meetings will determine whether PM Singh will visit Islamabad this summer, making it in India's interest to ensure the May 23-26 meetings are positive and produce results. Interestingly, the Pakistani experts were not interested in discussing possible resolution of the Sir Creek boundary; Pervez Iqbal Cheema, Islamabad Policy Research Institute, noted that Sir Creek is of minimal strategic importance and a solution will be easy to formulate as Indo-Pak relations normalize.  5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Pakistani press reports have focused on Indian internal debate over Siachen, with little recognition that public debate and process is a natural element of Indian democracy.  Instead, Pakistani observers interpret PM Singh's "struggle" with the Indian military as a signal that India is is ready to meet Pakistani demands on Siachen.  Post's think-tank contacts were on the mark in relation to Pakistani frustrations with the Composite Dialogue process:  even President Musharraf has publicly called for an acceleration of the talks, especially in regard to meetings on sensitive issues such as Kashmir.  Poloffs regularly hear similar sentiments expressed by working-level GOP officials, who claim the Composite Dialogue process has only establishes bus  ISLAMABAD 00009358  002 OF 002   links instead of tackling the "real issues" of Kashmir, Siachen, and water disputes.

UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 009473  SIPDIS  SENSITIVE SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: PGOV, PK, MARR, SNAR, KCRM, PTER, EAID SUBJECT: EXPLAINING THE SECURITY FORCES IN THE FATA  REF: 2004 ISLAMABAD 00554    1. (U) This cable provides an introduction to the myriad of security forces besides the regular Pakistani Army that operate in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and adjoining regions of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).  2. (U) Frontier Corps.  The paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) is the primary security force that operates in the FATA. The FC also operates in the Dir and Chitral districts of NWFP.  The FC is a formally trained, organized force of approximately 35,000 personnel commanded by Pakistani Army officers who are deputed to the Frontier Corps for three years from the Pakistani military.  FC recruits are drawn from the FATA tribes and units are posted in tribal agencies other than their own.  Under normal conditions the Frontier Corps is under the command of the Federal Ministry of Interior with the responsibility for anti-smuggling, anti-narcotics, and anti-terrorist operations, to patrol the western border and to maintain law and order and the writ of the government in the tribal areas.  However, since the beginning of operation Al Mizan in late 2001, the FC has been operating under wartime conditions.  During this period, 39 wings (or battalions) have been under the direct operational control of the Pakistani Army's 11th Corps.  Their missions include protecting and clearing lines of communications, conducting defensive and limited offensive operations along side the regular Pakistani Army and assisting the Pakistani Army in the formation of Lashkars.  3. (SBU) Frontier Constabulary.  The Frontier Constabulary force is a trained and disciplined law enforcement force that operates in the Frontier Regions (or FR).  There are six Frontier Regions that lie between the FATA and the settled districts of NWFP: Peshawar (excluding the city), Kohat, Bannu, Lakki, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan.  The Frontier Constabulary reports to the provincial Home Department's Chief Secretary and is commanded by provincial police officers that join the constabulary on deputation from their department.  There are approximately 17,000 personnel that comprise the Frontier Constabulary.  A secondary mission of the Constabulary is to provide security for vital installations and foreign missions. Many Frontier Constabularies have been diverted to such tasks in Islamabad, Karachi and other cities (Note: It is unfortunate that the Frontier Corps and Frontier Constabulary share the same initials.  GOP officials and local media are apt to refer to both as "FC," leading to frequent confusion as to which force is under discussion.  Post has even encountered senior GOP officials who were unaware that two different "FC" security forces operate in the FATA and Frontier Regions." End note)  4. (U) Levy Force.  Levy forces are drawn from the tribal communities and are responsible for day-to-day crime control in the FATA.  They are appointed by and report to the Politcal Agent of the relevant Agency and carry government-provided weapons.  Currently, levy forces number around 5,000 personnel and operate only in the Bajaur, Kurram and Orakzai agencies.  5. (U) Khasadar Force.  The Khasadars are present in all 7 FATA agencies and the 6 Frontier Regions.  They have no formal training, must provide their own weapons, and function similarly to levies.  They are under the supervision of the Political Agent of the agency concerned. Recruits,  numbering approximately 19,000, are drawn from local tribes in order to garner tribal support for the Political Agents and for the government projects the Khasadars are assigned to protect.  Notable families of the tribes control job allocation in the Khasadar force within their tribe through a hereditary system.  6. (U) Tribal Lashkars.  Tribal Lashkars are ad-hoc forces gathered from a particular tribe or from a few tribes under  ISLAMABAD 00009473  002 OF 002   certain compelling circumstances by the tribal jirga of elders, usually on the advice of the Political Agent of the area.  Typically, Lashkars are called for search operations in particular villages and disband after the accomplishment of a particular task. CROCKER

Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  (S)  During a May 23 conversation with the Ambassador, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz mentioned that he had invited Iranian First Vice President Parvaiz Davudi and Foreign Minister Narnal Kharazii to visit Islamabad on May 25.  Referring to Iranian President Ahmedinejad's public statements in the days following the recent D-8 Summit, at which Aziz and Turkish PM Erdogan privately pressed Ahmedinejad to avoid direct confrontation with the international community over Iran's nuclear programs (ref A), Aziz admitted that his advice clearly made little impression on the Iranian president. Aziz told the Ambassador that he plans to deliver the same message that he gave Ahmedinejad  -- that the EU-3 have offered Iran an attractive deal, one which Tehran should seriously consider -- to his Iranian guests this week.  The Prime Minister noted that Vice President Davudi has a reputation of being a more reasonable interlocutor; perhaps he will better appreciate Pakistan's concern that a negotiated resolution addressing Tehran's nuclear program be found before the controversy spreads beyond Iran's borders, destabilizing the entire region.

This cable is intended to inform the inter-agency discussion on how to stimulate counterrorism progress, stability, and political change in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Mission Pakistan--in biweekly "Interagency FATA Working Group" meetings that include officers from NAS, RAO, ODRP, FAS, USAID, REF, POL, ECON, DAO, LEGAT, and Consulate Peshawar--has been working on ways to further FATA reform since August 2005. The FATA Working Group discusses the robust ongoing USG assistance effort in the region, identifies future assistance opportunities, and strategizes solutions the overall problems in the FATA. In the past year, Post has reported on the basic problems in the FATA (ref A), outlined current USG efforts and opportunities for increased assistance (ref B), and informed Washington readers about new challenges and opportunities in FATA. Over the next three months, Post will produce a series of analytic reports that assess opportunities for increased USG assistance in FATA, examine GOP's FATA reform efforts (their military/ stabilization, political/administrative, and economic development strategies), and evaluate the effectiveness of key GOP players in FATA reform.

End note.)  CURRENT USG ASSISTANCE ---------------------- 9. (SBU) As outlined in Ref B, the USG has an ongoing robust assistance program in FATA, managed by several different Agencies. This includes:  (U) State/INL (Narcotics Affairs)  --Border Security Roads: Over $30 million to build over 300 km. of border security roads in Khyber, Khurram, North and South Waziristan, and Orakzai Agencies, working with the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers.  Construction started in Spring 2004. Progress has been slow due to security and weather conditions. Work has effectively stopped in North and South Waziristan since late Summer 2005 because of ongoing CT operations and the security situation. Road construction is accompanied by small schemes (water and electrification) to increase community buy-in.  -- Frontier Corps Outposts:  NAS has funded construction of 26 border outposts in FATA for the FC; 19 have been completed.  Construction of the remaining even posts, all in North Waziristan, has been stalled due to security conditions.  --Equipping Frontier Corps/NWFP: We are currently procuring $7.75 million for vehicles, communication equipment, night vision goggles, bullet proof jackets/helmets through FY 2005 supplemental Funds. We have provided such equipment to Frontier Corps since 2002.  --Counter Narcotics: We have been involved in road building for enforcement and market access, and alternative  ISLAMABAD 00009585  003 OF 004   development projects in Mohmand and Bajaur Agencies since 1989.  Similar projects began in Khyber Agency in 2001. We also provide support for poppy monitoring and eradication in FATA.  --Levies Training: When the final Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is signed with the SAFRON ministry, NAS will begin the $686K refurbishment of the Levies Central Training Facility in Bajaur Agency.  NAS will also provide technical assistance with curriculum development and instructor development training through ICITAP.  (S) Military Assistance (ODRP), including:  (Note: This section includes ODRP resources allocated Pakistan-wide because a majority of this support and funding is intended for the GWOT. End Note)  --Coalition Support Funds (on average $80 million per month) provided to the Federal Government as a reimbursement for operational expenses in support of OEF. Includes: reimbursement for the costs for feeding and housing 35,000 Army, 41,000 Frontier Corps, 1,500 Pak Air Force and 105 Pakistan Navy officials), ammunition, fuel, wear-and tear on vehicles and equipment used in direct support against Al Qaida and anti-Coalition militants.  (Note: ODRP indicates that while CSF has been worth the investment to date, because it encourages the Pakistan Military to deploy troops in areas it has been long been reluctant to enter, it may be time for a USG policy review on the issue. ODRP suggests that future CSF should not be guaranteed for mere presence; instead, reimbursement should be based on performance, and that CENTCOM/SECDEF should determine the criteria for reimbursement based on desired behavior. End note.)  --Foreign Military Financing: ODRP manages the $300 million per year allocated for shaping Pakistan's Defense Structure. To date, Pakistan has chosen to spend national funds and FMF against conventional defense needs instead of targeting procurement for training and equipment that would have higher utility in its internal GWOT. (Note: ODRP suggests more direct management of FMF to ensure GWOT-essential efforts are adequately resourced. End note.)  --Counter Narcotics: Through ODRP, DOD provided $22 million in FY06 to enhance Pakistan's ability to control the Makran Coast against the flow of narcotics through southern Pakistan.  In the process, Pakistan has enhanced its control of semi-governed territory and improved control of its southern borders.  --International Military Education and Training (IMET): ODRP manages $2.04 million per year in IMET funds to increase the mil-mil bonds, and fill in a 11-year gap in relations due to sanctions.  --Overseas Humanitarian Disaster Assistance and Civic Aid (OHDACA): ODRP manages a DOD pilot program of $800,000 as proof of a concept for providing assistance to FATA. This money supplements USAID's school construction projects throught the FATA.  --Counter Terrorism Fellowship Program: Through ODRP, DOD provided $500,000 in CT fellowship funds to accentuate education in subjects of value to the GWOT.  (U) Development Assistance (USAID) includes:  ---School Construction and Furnishing: USAID provided $4.7 million to the Pakistani firm, Associates in Development, to construct 65 primary, middle, and high schools in 6 agencies in the FATA. One school is completed, 44 are underway in  ISLAMABAD 00009585  004.2 OF 004   Khyber, Bajaur, Khurram, Mohmand, and Orakzai, and an additional 12 sites are being assessed and identified. Security considerations have delayed construction of 8 schools in North Waziristan.  Sanitary and drinking water are being provided by the $800,000 DOD OHDACA grant mentioned above. The Embassy of Japan has agreed to construct an additional 65 schools in FATA using USAID's design.  ---Scholarships for Pre-Service Teacher Education: 20 scholarships have been awarded to females from FATA to attend a one-year pre-service teacher education program in Khyber Agency. The Academy for Educational Development was awarded $200,000 to administer this program.  --Water/Sanitation: In September 2005, USAID awarded $400,000 to UNICEF to implement a program to improve water and sanitation facilities in 190 girls' schools in Khyber and Mohmand Agencies. Activities are also underway to provide hygiene and sanitation education to community members and parent-teacher associations.  USAID will also partner with the GOP to implement President Musharraf's Clean Drinking Water initiative in Bajaur, Mohmand, and Khurram. Under this program, GOP will construct water treatment plants and USAID will provide capacity building and training in plant and water-resource management and the promotion of hygiene practices.  USAID expects to award a grant in June 2006 for this project, which we anticipate will begin in early 2007.  --Microcredit: In September 2005, USAID provided $4 million to Khushalibank to establish stand-alone and mobile bank branches in all seven FATA Agencies. 50,000 loans and 1,000 small infrastructure schemes are to eventually be provided in the five-year program.  --Child Health: USAID plans to implement a child-health program in FATA to focus on increasing the access and availability of child health services, improving the quality of health services, and increasing awareness and knowledge at the househlold level.  USAID plans to award a grant in June 2006 for this project.  (S) Other USG Assistance for FATA  --Several other Agencies at Post also have projects related to FATA stability and GWOT. Details of programming and funding allocated may be reported via other channels. CROCKER 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 009696  SIPDIS  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/10/2031 TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, PK SUBJECT: LIMITED PROGRESS ON DOMESTIC EXTREMISM  REF: ISLAMABAD 9542  ISLAMABAD 00009696  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, d  1. (U) This is the third in a series of four cables assessing the GOP's progress in its crackdown on extremism.  2. (S/NF) Summary:  Progress on combating domestic extremism, part of the GOP's July 2005 crackdown, has suffered from competing priorities, limited political capital, and a vocal opposition from Islamic conservatives.  While initial GOP actions detained a number of second-tier leaders and foot soldiers from domestic extremist groups, shuttered hate publications, and forced groups to drop their public profile, these gains have, in large part, been allowed to lapse. Legislative changes to prevent discrimination against religious minorities continue to languish in parliament, held hostage by conservative elements in the ruling party. Attempts by the GOP to regulate madrassas have been persistently weakened in response to demands from madrassa leaders.  The Northern Areas, however, present a sharp contrast to the general trend.  There, a sustained campaign by security forces against both Sipah-i-Sahaba (SSP) and Sipah-i-Mohammad (SMP) has curtailed their operations and restored peace to the troubled Gilgit district.  End Summary.  Extremist Groups  3. (S/NF)  The country's prominent domestic extremist groups Sipah-i-Sahaba (SSP), Lashkar-i-Jhangvi (LJ), and Sipah-i-Mohammad (SMP) were among the first banned by President Musharraf in January 2002.  Sunni Tehrik escaped banning, due to its ties to senior military and government officials, and continued both its assassination campaign against Deobandi clerics and its political activities largely unimpeded.  Prior to their listing, banned groups engaged in regular assassination of each other's leaders and supporters, frequent mob violence against religious and political opponents, and outright armed clashes in certain Punjabi districts.  SSP and SMP maintained an active political wing, holding frequent public rallies and participating in elections, with the SSP regularly winning provincial and national assembly seats from its home district of Jhang.  4. (S/NF) Following the ban, these groups were required to take a lower public profile, curtailing public meetings; their militant wings, however, continued operations and SSP retained its Jhang seat.  Due to heightened scrutiny, the militant wings were required to curtail the scope of operations, focusing on higher profile suicide bombings of religious opponents' mosques and gatherings and assassinations of religious clergy.  When disputes over textbooks exploded into societal violence in the Northern Areas in 2004, SSP and SMP established armed wings in Gilgit, fomenting additional violence and turning the town into a battleground.  LJ, which had increased the scope of its activities to include Christian, Hindu, and western targets post-September 11, had already suffered a setback following its participation in the unsuccessful December 2004 attempts on President Musharraf's life:  many of its senior leaders were arrested and still remain in detention, and its activities were placed under closer scrutiny by intelligence and law enforcement officials.  Even so, the group was still able to carry out high profile, successful suicide attacks against Brailvi/Shi'a targets.  As of July 2005,  SSP, ST, and SMP leaders were at large, highly visible in public media, and actively participating in politics.  5. (S/NF) In the immediate aftermath of President Musharraf's July 2005 crackdown announcement, the prominence of all  ISLAMABAD 00009696  002.2 OF 003   sectarian groups, including ST, diminished.  Police detained approximately 320 second-tier leaders and activists from SSP, SMP, ST, and LJ under anti-terrorism provisions.  Main leaders of the organizations curtailed public events and press statements and, in some cases, effectively went into hiding.  Hate publications by domestic extremist, militant, and terrorist organizations were seized from vendors in major cities, and restrictions on radical clerics' use of mosque loudspeakers were put in place.  In late September 2005, security forces arrested senior LJ leader Asif Choto and successfully disrupted the activities of the organization's Islamabad/Rawalpindi cell.  In mid-October 2005, the GOP launched a security force operation in the Gilgit district to curtail the activities of SSP and SMP.  Local leaders of both groups were detained on terrorism charges (and remain in prison in Rawalpindi), supporters were disarmed, and order was largely restored to the town.  6. (S/NF) These gains against domestic extremist organizations were not sustained.  In the aftermath of the October 8 earthquake, government attention was largely diverted.  Approximately half of those detained were released within 30 days.  The remainder were freed by January 2006. Confiscation of hate publications effectively ceased in October 2005 and has, for the most part, not resumed.  In many urban areas, use of mosque loudspeakers for extremist propaganda resumed by October and November 2005.  Despite some restrictions on their activities both SSP and ST ran candidates in the local bodies elections in August and October 2005.  While we are unaware of any domestic extremist group participation in earthquake relief efforts, SSP, SMP, and ST all raised funds among supporters, ostensibly to aid earthquake victims.  This allowed their leaders to reassert a public presence that was further strengthened during protests over the Bajaur incident and the Danish cartoons.  SSP, SMP, and ST continued to assassinate the others' members and clerics from opposing religious sects.  SSP and LJ supporters were responsible for suicide bombings of religious gatherings, including the February 2006 attack in Hangu and the April 2006 attack in Karachi.  The April 2006 Karachi attack was a major setback for ST, as many of its leaders were killed in the suicide bombing.  A major SSP conference on the outskirts of Islamabad in mid-April is widely seen as evidence that restrictions on public activities by the domestic extremist organizations will again be ignored.  Madrassa Reform  7. (C/NF) Madrassa reform was already well-advanced prior to the July 2005 crackdown.  In June 2002, the GOP issued directives requiring registration of foreign students, banning foreign funding of madrassas, and requiring registration with one of the five independent madrassa boards or directly with the GOP.  Most madrassas complied with the student and school registration requirements.  While madrassas openly flouted the ban on foreign financing whenever possible, the ban did largely end government funding from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that previously supported a large number of such schools.  In addition, the GOP had negotiated agreements with the madrassa boards that resulted in the phased-in introduction of modern subjects at schools under their control and banned the teaching of sectarian hatred, militancy, or extremism.  8. (C/NF) As part of his July 2005 crackdown, Musharraf promised to ban foreign students, to require direct registration with the GOP, and to introduce a national examination scheme for madrassas.  Musharraf enacted the foreign student ban in July 2005 with an effective date of December 31, 2005.  Registered Afghan refugees were exempted  ISLAMABAD 00009696  003.2 OF 003   from this ban.  The Interior Ministry deported an unknown number of foreign students and claimed that 95 percent of foreign students had left madrassas.  Note:  We believe that the Interior Ministry tracking system is reliable.  End Note.  The GOP has no immediate plans to revise the ban on foreign students.  The GOP chose to negotiate with the madrassa boards on examination and registration.  Musharraf signed a December 2005 order on registration that requires a yearly description of educational activities and a financial auditor's statement for all registered madrassas.  It also bans the teaching of sectarian hatred, militancy, or extremism.  The order is a step back from earlier versions that would have required extensive yearly audits of madrassa finances and activities -- steps that would have enabled more effective GOP oversight.  Approximately 11,000 out of an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 madrassas have registered. Discussions on a national examination scheme continue between the madrassa boards and the Ministry of Religious Affairs. No madrassas have yet been closed for violations of either the post-September 11 or the July 2005 orders, nor has enforcement action been taken against those madrassas operated by domestic extremist groups and/or those teaching sectarian hatred, militancy, and extremism.  Comment  9. (S/NF) Islamist politicians and conservative religious clerics have vocally opposed all parts of the GOP crackdown on domestic extremism.  In addition, some in the GOP's own parliamentary party and in the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz have opposed action against SSP and ST and madrassa reform.  Liberal opposition parties have consistently refused to defend any action by the Musharraf government, leaving the GOP without political support for these initiatives.  In the face of strong societal backlash over Bajaur and the Danish cartoons and the upcoming national and provincial elections, the GOP has been reluctant to advance forcibly an admittedly controversial agenda.  While we understand the GOP's reluctance, renewed focus on domestic extremism is a critical component of meaningfully advancing Musharraf's "enlightened moderation" agenda.  The informal ties that many domestic extremist groups have developed with designated foreign terrorist organizations are equally worrying.  Sustained international pressure will be necessary to focus GOP attention on this component of the Global War on Terror.  End Comment. CROCKER

The Additional Secretary responded that the GOP is committed to non-proliferation.  It already has legislation for interdiction in its territorial waters, and it is now commanding CTF-150, which has both a counterterrorism and non-proliferation mission.  Haider concluded by saying that Pakistan prefers international agreements reached through UN processes.  If the GOP cannot go to the Warsaw meeting as observers, it will not attend, but will remain actively engaged on non-proliferation in other fora. CROCKER 
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 009704  SIPDIS  NOFORN SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/25/2016 TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, PTER, MOPS, PK, AF, IR SUBJECT: FREE, FAIR, AND ISI: THE PML ELECTION STRATEGY  REF: ISLAMABAD 9472  ISLAMABAD 00009704  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d.  1. (C/NF)  Summary:  According to PML Secretary General Mushahid Hussain, the party's goal in the upcoming elections is a plurality in the National Assembly.  He identified urban areas in central Punjab (Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad) as the chief battlegrounds, predicted a strong PML victory in Balochistan, anticipated a PML draw with the Awami National Party (ANP) and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F) in NWFP, and conceded Sindh to the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Despite assurances that the PML wanted a free and fair contest, Mushahid made clear that use of development resources, presidential campaigning, and research by the intelligence agencies were, in his view, legitimate tactics available to the PML.  Mushahid argued that the PML's winning strategy was a close relationship with Musharraf coupled with denigration of the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) historic governance record.  Mushahid admitted that inflation and the deteriorating situation in Waziristan posed domestic problems for the party.  He called on the United States to refrain from provocative action in Iran and to do more to improve Pak-Afghan relations, claiming that both could be exploited by Islamist parties during the election. End Summary.  Electoral Strategy  2. (C/NF) In a May 25 meeting, PML Secretary General Mushahid Hussain provided a preview of his party's electoral strategy to Acting PolCouns and Poloff.  Mushahid stated that at this stage he believed that the PML would be running without a formal supporting coalition and that its national strategy would, therefore, focus principally on capturing a plurality of seats in the National Assembly.  In Punjab, Mushahid predicted that the PML would do well in rural areas and in nothern urban centers.  The chief battleground would be the central urban districts where the party would face strong opposition from the PPP and PML-N.  Winning these districts would be a priority, as they would likely determine the balance of power in the next Assembly.  In Balochistan, Mushahid predicted a strong PML showing in the center and south due to its close relationship with most sardars (save the rebellious troika of Bugti, Marri, and Mengal).  The party was prepared to cede northern constituencies to the JUI-F, which he believed could be bought into a coalition. In Sindh, Mushahid predicted a weak PML showing.  The provincial party was divided, and despite its proactive Chief Minister, there was little hope of dividing PPP from its rural base or MQM from its urban supporters.  In NWFP, Mushahid predicted an even race and possible seat adjustments between PML, ANP, and JUI-F.  The goal was to divide the Islamist coalition and build a new PML-led provincial government.  3. (C/NF) Mushahid's emerging campaign strategy for the PML would place primary emphasis on the party's close ties with President Musharraf.  The objective was to capture pro-Musharraf voters (youth, liberal middle class, and women), which strongly supported the President but not necessarily the party.  In this vein, the PML would stress the stability that Musharraf had brought to Pakistan and the differentiation between his regime and the corruption-laden governments of the PPP and PML-N.  Mushahid predicted that the PML would run a campaign that is one-third positive (focused on Musharraf's policies) and two-thirds negative (focused on the PPP and PML-N regimes' failures).  Mushahid would welcome the return of these parties' leaders, Benazir  ISLAMABAD 00009704  002.2 OF 003   Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, as both were easy targets for criticism.  However, he predicted that neither had any real desire to return to Pakistan.  Asked about potential electoral issues facing the PML, Mushahid cited inflation and the situation in Waziristan.  Mushahid was convinced that price controls on basic commodities and Gen. Orakzai's appointment as governor in NWFP would be sufficient to redress these problems.  4. (C/NF) Mushahid predicted that well-publicized differences within the PML were, in fact, transitory.  Party members, including the dissidents, recognized that their political futures were inextricably tied to the PML and Musharraf. Divides would be quickly repaired once the candidate selection process was formally underway, and dissidents sought tickets from the party leadership, which would control the allocation process.  According to Mushahid, PML tickets would be awarded based upon "electability."  The party was looking for candidates with strong ties to their district; feudal lords and tribal leaders would be strong contenders. Approximately 70 percent of the PML assembly delegation had won solid majorities, and most, save a few "troublemakers," would receive tickets.  Those with slim margins of victory could be replaced.  Free and Fair Elections  5. (S/NF) Mushahid stressed that the PML wanted a free and fair contest.  Its leaders were prepared to negotiate rules of the game with opposition parties and the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC).  A credible electoral process was necessary to provide the new government with the popular mandate required.  Several statements, during other parts of the conversation, however, called this commitment into question.  For instance, Mushahid stated that the PML would use development funds to support candidates in marginal districts; the President would actively campaign on behalf of the PML; and intelligence services would continue to conduct polling of PML and PML candidate popularity in key constituencies.  (Note: All are clear violations of election law and regulations.  End Note.)  Iran  6. (C/NF) Mushahid raised concern about the current stalemate with Iran.  He asserted that hostile American action against Iran would provide Pakistan's Islamist parties with an attractive election plank, possibly swaying the NWFP contest in their favor as the Afghanistan invasion had done in 2002. Mushahid recognized that rhetoric and actions by the Iranian presidency were not helpful in resolving the nuclear impasse.  For this reason, he and others in the GOP were reaching out to more moderate elements inside Iran including the Foreign Ministry with a view to influencing positively its conduct. He cautioned the USG not/not to view the Iranian government as a monolith or to assume the current President is firmly in control.  Afghanistan  7. (C/NF) Mushahid expressed grave concern about the "deteriorating" relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan.  In his view, this could be exploited by extremists on both sides to derail the constructive engagement policy which he and others had tried to build with the Karzai government.  Mushahid called on the USG to do more to strengthen cooperation and contacts between the countries' intelligence services and political leadership, as we had done on the military side.   ISLAMABAD 00009704  003.2 OF 003   Comment  8. (C/NF) Mushahid provided a realistic look at internal PML dynamics and planning as it approaches the upcoming national elections.  His analysis of the PML's strengths and weaknesses with the electorate largely track with our own.  A strategy emphasizing President Musharraf, without question, plays to the PML's strongest campaigner and most popular figure.  Direct presidential involvement in the party's campaign remains a risky strategy, as it violates constitutional prohibitions on partisan activity by the President.  Opposition parties, as they have already done, will continue to seize on such involvement to claim an unfair electoral process, to highlight their supposed democratic credentials, and perhaps ultimately to woe the liberal middle class vote that the PML's strategy is designed to capture.

Crocker, DSCG 05-01, January 2005, Edition 1, Reason: 1.4 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary.  At a May 23 conference celebrating 55 years of Pakistan-China relations, Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz characterized the Sino-Pak relationship as a model bilateral relationship, in which both countries are committed to peaceful co-existence, sovereign equality, and non-interference in internal affairs.  He emphasized the deep trust the two nations have for each other, and mentioned several areas of potential economic and military cooperation.  His remarks on the Indo-U.S. relationship, however, provide insight into Pakistani insecurities that the U.S. values its relationship with India more than its GWOT partner, Pakistan.   End summary.  2.  (U)  The conference, sponsored by the MFA-funded Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad (ISS), celebrated 55 years of Pakistan-China relations.  The guest of honor, PM Shaukat Aziz, emphasized Pakistan's deep military and economic relationship with China and noted that the bilateral relationship is not based on "transient interests", but is "higher than the Himalayas, deeper than the sea."  He cited the recent Pakistan-China Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Relations as an example of a relationship characterized by peaceful co-existence, sovereign equality, and non-interference in internal affairs.  He also noted China's possible future assistance in space technology, which would give Pakistan an entry into space programs.  The February 2005 defense agreement with China will continue, he said, with the joint production of JF-17 planes and tanks, as well as research and development programs that will "lay the groundwork for future cooperation."  Aziz praised growing Chinese investment in Pakistan, and thanked China for its assistance in constructing Gwadar port.  He talked of upgrading the Karakoram Highway (KKH) to improve Sino-Pak trade, and without providing any detail, touched upon the prospect of constructing an oil pipeline from Gwadar to China.  Notably absent in Aziz's comments was any mention of benefits from ongoing Sino-Pak free trade negotiations. After applauding China's assistance with the Chashma I and II nuclear reactors, Aziz emphasized that nuclear technology should be used for peaceful purposes.  In a quick aside, he pointed out that a nation has the right to produce nuclear energy peacefully.  (Note: This comment is a standard GOP talking point when discussing the current controversy over Iran's nuclear programs.  End note.)  3.  (U)  In response to a journalist's provocative question on the new "unholy alliance" between the U.S. and India, PM Aziz emphasized that, "There is nothing evil in that (the U.S.-India relationship)."  He further qualified his comment by reminding the audience that China's emergence as a player on the international arena has deepened the Indo-U.S. relationship.  He referred to Newton's third law of motion -- every action has an equal and opposite reaction -- and explained a strong Sino-Pak relationship is a natural reaction to the Indo-U.S. relationship, and ended by reminding the audience that, "The best diplomacy is quiet diplomacy."  4.  (U)  Aziz was then asked what major challenges he envisioned the Pak-Sino relationship facing in the next five to ten years.  He responded that the challenge would lay in "creating new avenues and looking for new opportunities" for cooperation in the future.  He mused that one-sided relationships do not last forever and that only a relationship that is mutually beneficial is sustainable. Pakistan and China must promote security -- not hegemony -- he said, and the two nations must work to strengthen the UN system in order to resolve conflicts.  5.  (C)  Comment:  As the inaugural speaker, PM Aziz spoke, answered a few questions, and left the conference.  He was  ISLAMABAD 00009705  002 OF 002   not present when the discussion descended into openly anti-American rhetoric.  Yet his inflated praise of the Sino-Pak relationship --  characterized as one based on trust, entrenched regional interests, and an off-limits attitude toward the other nation's internal affairs -- offered a mirror image of common Pakistani sentiments about the U.S.-Pakistan relationship.  By emphasizing that the Pak-Sino relationship is built on a solid foundation, as opposed to "transient" interests, Aziz  reflected an undercurrent of Pakistani insecurity that the U.S. is not fully committed to a long-term strategic  partnership.  6.  (C)  Comment (con't): Aziz's comments aside, the conference should have been billed "Seminar on U.S.-Indian Perfidy."  While the Chinese panelists focused on historical examples of Sino-Pak cooperation (Pakistani facilitation of Henry Kissinger's 1971 trip to China was one example), Pakistani speakers stressed the need for a tight Pak-Sino relationship in light of a stronger U.S.-India relationship. (Note:  Pakistani comments about this "new" U.S.-India relationship were so vitriolic that members of the audience repeatedly turned around in their chairs to gauge poloff's reaction.)  For example, after a dramatic reading of the India, Pakistan, and China sections from the 2006 U.S. National Security Strategy, the ISS Chairman argued that the U.S.-India nuclear deal has effectively co-opted India into endorsing "the American strategic tenets of preemptive action, interference in internal affairs, and regime change" -- hardly the basis for a strategic U.S.-Pakistani partnership.

The stabilization of Pakistan's Federally Administered Areas (FATA) and the acceleration of political and economic development in this troubled region is a complex task that will determine the success of USG and Government of Pakistan (GOP) counterterrorism efforts. Since 9/11, GOP has implemented a series of strategies and initiatives intended to gain greater administrative control over the region, stabilize the turbulent law and order situation, boost development and increase GWOT successes. Each successive GOP attempt has been hampered by political constraints and administrative failures, but the latest comprehensive strategy--unveiled on May 9th--indicates that GOP is placing a higher priority on successfully implementing changes in the region. End Summary  THE FATA PROBLEM--IN BRIEF -------------------------- 2. (C//NF) The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are Pakistan's (and the GWOT's) most geo-strategically located territories. It is also Pakistan's least developed region. FATA tribesmen are notoriously proud of their Pashtun and Islamic heritage and of their right to self-governance. This heritage led the British colonial government to leave the FATA's administration to a loosely Federally Administered Tribal area with only the veneer of representative politics, an autonomous parallel judicial system, and a reliance on tribal social and legal codes for administration. FATA tribesmen have strong tribal ties and affinities with their Pashtun brethren in Afghanistan--ties facilitated by a porous border (demarcated by the "Durrand Line") which only the Government of Pakistan accepts as an international border. It is also an area where an administrative and legal vacuum--created by years of government neglect, the Afghan jihad and later Afghan civil war, and an increase in the level  of strict Islamization--has been filled by Islamic community leaders, some with tribal and religious affiliations with former Taliban leaders, and other anti-Coalition militants. (Note: For more detailed information on the FATA's problems, consult Ref A).  3. (C//NF) When these factors are combined, they create the current operating environment in the FATA: --Porous borders that allow for the safe-passage and safe-haven of militants; --Rudimentary systems to promote law and order; --Agencies susceptible to control by radicalized militants and clerics; --Low levels of education, health care, and economic activity; --Agency-level administrators with little influence or power with the tribes or central government; --Separate and unequal judicial and political systems; --Tribesmen hostile to non-tribal foreigners, including Pakistanis, and to any extended Pakistani military presence; --Substantial Pak Army and Frontier Corps presence taking heavy casualties; --Deteriorating security and increasing radicalization in two agencies, which may be spreading; and --An outmoded and inept bureaucracy at the Federal and Provincial levels.  GOP's NEW FATA STRATEGY ----------------------- 4. (C//NF) The GOP has long been aware of the FATA's problems, and since 9/11, has tried many successive strategies to "fix" FATA. Many of these have centered around military stabilization, stop-gap administrative changes, and  ISLAMABAD 00009706  002.2 OF 004   promises for increased development funding that have not gone far. Faced with the reality of an increasingly unstable and radicalized FATA (particularly North Waziristan), significant military casualties, and the spread of law and order problems to the FATA's neighboring frontier regions, President Musharraf has become re-energized on finding a permanent solution to the FATA.  This past winter, Musharraf and Prime Minister Aziz appointed former FATA Chief Secretary Sahibzada Imtiaz as the Prime Minister's Advisor on FATA, charging him with drafting a new political/administrative strategy for the FATA (ref B) . They also appointed Jehangir Tehreen to draft a strategy on jump-starting economic development and activity in the FATA (ref C). Not to be left out, the military has also re-iterated its integrated strategy (ref D).  5. (S//NF) Together, the GOP hopes to implement--in concert--a three-pronged strategy that calls for:  -- POLITICAL/ADMINISTRATIVE STRATEGY (Ref B and Septel)  A. A new, stronger NWFP Governor;  B. Centralized decision making by the NWFP Governor (and unofficially the PM and President) (Note: The GOP officially appointed a new NWFP Governor--General (Ret.) Orakzai--on May 22, in the belief that a stronger, more military-minded Governor would be more capable of getting cooperation and implementing changes (Ref D) End Note.);  C. Integrated, unified military, economic, and development decision making at the FATA Secretariat;  D. Strengthened powers for each Agency's local administrator (the Political Agent);  -- DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (Ref C)  A. Creating a new Frontier Development Company (FDC) to oversee FATA development, and allocating $2 million for its setup;  B. Earmarking up to $600 million development funds over 5 years for development in the FATA ($150 million for 2006) in a Border Areas Development Program that is run by the FDC;  C. Asking the ADB and World Bank to draft a needs assessment for FATA by June 2006;  D. Increasing capacity to utilize allocated funds for FATA at present only 65-75 percent of funds are spent);  E. Developing a road network to benefit tribes; and  F. Drawing up a $150 million five-year "mini-Marshall Plan" to boost economic activity through: Reconstruction opportunity zones; agriculture and livestock management projects; 100 small dams; vocational technical institutes to train the workforce; community water schemes; increased spending on education and health; and development of the marble industry.  -- MILITARY STRATEGY  The Pakistan Army's FATA military strategy--articulated at the May 1-5 DCG meetings in Washington--aims to "Pursue the elimination of terrorists and deny the use of Pakistani territory for miscreant activity through the articulation of military, political, and development measures". In short, Pak mil will:  A. Seal the border with Afghanistan effectively through -troop saturation, -reinforce bases, -increased number of border check points,  ISLAMABAD 00009706  003.2 OF 004   -40-50 mobile checkpoints, listening posts, -strikes, raids and ambushes conducted by quick reaction forces and the Special Operations Task Force;  B. Conduct close cordination with ODRP, CFC-A/CJTF-76, NATO/ISAF and tri-lateral intelligence agencies through liaison and mutual visits;  C. Modify operational techniques to emphasize reliance on special forces to strike "miscreants" at short notice;  D. Double the size of the Frontier Corps and enhance political administration (helping to build stronger political agents, and maliks) and ensure coordination between military and political tiers;  F. Enhance integration of Frontier Corps and Khasdar forces, giving them greater role in maintaing law and order and preventing cross-border infiltrations; and  G. Contribute to economic development to reward tribes that cooperate and increase inter-tribal alliances.  CONSTRAINTS TO FURTHER, FASTER CHANGE ----------------------------------------- 6. (C//NF) The far-reaching civilian (development and political) prong of GOP's counter-terrorism/FATA normalization strategies has been hindered by domestic political attitudes, problems in administration, shortfalls in absorptive and administrative capacity, and security problems. A revolving series of NWFP Governors, Political Agents, and administrative mechanisms (FATA Development Corporation, a new FATA Secretariat) intended to improve administration have so far failed at the task of establishing better control and faster development. Clashes in personality, administrative style (i.e., an ability to get along with the Corps Commander and FC leadership), and strategy (agreement with Musharraf's grand vision) have hamstrung each successive effort.  7. (SBU) To succeed, the GOP's new administrative strategies must also overcome a myriad of constraints and political hurdles, such as:  A. ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS -- Absorptive Capacity -- Lack of Effective Administrators -- Administrative Mindset  B. REDLINES FOR TRIBAL CHIEFS -- US/Foreign Presence for Development -- Bigger PAK Army Footprint in FATA -- Resistance to Elected Local Government -- Resistance to Political Party Activity  C. OTHER RISKS -- Tribal demand for pullout of troops -- Tribal demand for negotiation with militants -- Tribal demands to Remove Political Agents (Note: President Musharraf has said that this is not an option at this time. End note.)  8. (C//NF) The military prong of the GOP's counter-terrorism/FATA normalization strategy faces its own series of constraints--mainly the GOP's careful balance of political priorities, tenuous coalition politics, and Musharraf's need to maintain popular support for his civil-military government. President Musharraf's carefully constructed ruling coalition enjoys the tenuous support of several political parties who have made announced that they will not support a larger GOP military deployment in the FATA or US military operations in the FATA (particularly air raids and operations) without express prior coordination. Mainstream and Islamist political parties also remain  ISLAMABAD 00009706  004.2 OF 004   intolerant of civilian casualties and collateral damage, as well as the specter of targeting popular madrassas and mosques. Tribal leaders share this national intolerance of a larger footprint, but also may strongly (and militantly) resist a significant foreign/US footprint for development work, and a larger Pakistan Army presence in the FATA. Some are also likely to resist larger political changes, such as inviting political party activity into the FATA or integrating the FATA into NWFP.  COMMENT ------- 9. (C//NF) The success of the GOP's newly articulated political, military, and development strategies to stabilize and develop the FATA hinges on political will, popular support, and good management.  The availability of funding and international support are also critical.  Past FATA strategies were derailed by ineffective management and Musharraf's political balancing act, which has limited the GOP's political and military flexibility.  This time around, Musharraf, his advisors, key military officers, the FATA secretariat, and the new NWFP governor are re-energized for a  SIPDIS hard fight.  The questions are now whether the new NWFP governor can get the job done, and more importantly, whether the tribes will accept this new course of action. CROCKER

In the aftermath of the July 7, 2005 bombings in London, President Musharraf made a series of broad-reaching committments to tackle extremism and terrorism in Pakistan. One committment was to stabilize the troubled border regions known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) through an integrated strategy combining increased military operations with stronger political administration and economic development. Implementation of the overall plan has been slow. The report card for military operations is mixed, law and order in both North and South Waziristan  continue to deteriorate, despite a hefty troop presence and increased patrols in the region. The government appears to be pursuing FATA stabilization and development with new vigor since March 2006 (ref A); actual progress will require sustained political will to carry out change and better management of the strategy, both of which are in abundance at present. End summary.  Expanded Operations, Uneven Execution -------------------------------------- 3. (C) At the direction of President Musharraf and the Director General Military Operations (DGMO), the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps expanded "Operation Al Mizan," (originally launched in 2002 as an integrated political, military, and economic strategy) in the FATA in September 2005. As articulated by the DGMO, the objectives of the military operations are to "pursue and eliminate terrorists, deny safehaven, and stabilize the region." To do so, the military has stationed approximately 35,000 XI Corps troops and 14,000 Frontier Corps troops in FATA. (Note:  GHQ counts the roughly 28,000 Frontier Corps troops deployed in Balochistan when they say there are 80,000 troops deployed along the border. End note.) They have also established 227 border posts, 40-50 mobile checkpoints, and stationed 5 infantry battalions of Quick Reaction Forces (QRFs) (2 in South Waziristan and 3 in North Waziristan).  4. (S) The 39 operations conducted to date have had varying degrees of success, due to uneven execution and tactical mistakes. Overall, they have led to the capture of 124 militants and the death of 324 (including 76 foreign fighters), according to a GHQ powerpoint presentation passed to the Embassy. In January 2006, Pakistani military officials admitted to US military counterparts that their tactics--repetetive cordon and search operations--were not working and that improperly integrated operations and intelligence and equipment/training shortfalls resulted in several failed operations in late 2005. Pak mil is now attempting to rectify this situation, and the DGMO has reported a few successes of late. Raids in January 2006 led to the apprehension of 13 and the death of 14 "foreign miscreants," according to the DGMO. In April 2006, military spokesmen announced the probable capture or killing of two high value targets in separate operations:  --Muhsin Musa Matawai, an Egyptian national wanted for involvement in the 1998 East African Embassy bombings, captured during a raid in North Waziristan, and  --Marwan Hadid-al Suri, a Syrian national reportedly behind attacks on Pakistani forces and US forces in Eastern Afghanistan, arrested in Bajaur.  Waziristan: From Bad to Worse in 60 Days  ISLAMABAD 00009708  002 OF 002   ---------------------------------------- 5. (C) Despite unprecedented troop and patrol levels, the military's control over law and order South Waziristan remains weak.  Militants in South Waziristan--which has been unstable since troops first entered in 2004--continue to harbor foreign fighters, nurture militant clerics, and attack anyone perceived to be "pro-government." Over the past year, 150 pro-government tribesmen (maliks, clerics and others) have been targeted and killed in South Waziristan (Ref A).  6. (C) Meanwhile, North Waziristan deteriorated rapidly in December 2005 and early January 2006, worsened in March 2006, and remains beyond government control today (ref B). There is a growing popular perception--reinforced by daily press reporting--that the violence has reached a point beyond the government's ability to re-establish authority (refs B and D). In December 2005 and January 2006, militant clerics--calling themselves Taliban or students of the Qu'ran--launched a "law and order" campaign aimed at driving out the military and imposing their own brand of security in the region (Ref C). Journalists and government officials indicate that the clerics--linked to anti-coalition militants in Afghanistan--have played up collateral civilian casualties and played on the weakness of the political administration and tribal leaders to gain public sympathy. Today, some journalists say the militant clerics have a following of 1500 able to launch daily ambushes, grenade and IED attacks on military patrols and installations in North Waziristan, relegating many troops to their barracks. Since August 2005, 56 soldiers in North Waziristan have been killed.  Comment ------- 7. (S) The absence until now of a comprehensive effort to establish strong and responsive political control, law and order, and economic benefits for cooperation mars any successes the GOP can count from Operation Al Mizan. We have pressed this point repeatedly with the Pakistani leadership, and in January, Musharraf began to acknowledge the need for a major policy overhaul in the tribal areas.  The governmetn's mid-May revelation of a new strategy for the FATA (ref A) is potentially a major step forward, but the proof will lie in its implementation. CROCKER

(SBU) On May 25, Poloff delivered reftel demarche points on UN reform at the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Ministerial-level meeting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's UN-I Director, Imran Siddiqui.  Having recently served at Pakistan's Permanent Mission to the UN in New York and well versed on UN reform, Mr. Siddiqui commented that as co-chair on the UN's committee for management reform the Government of Pakistan (GOP) works closely with the USG and is apprised of its views.  Siddiqui said that as co-chair the GOP understands its obligation to work towards a compromise on contentious issues; at the same time, the GOP also has a national position on UN management reform, including on specific issues on the use of information technology, financing peacekeeping operations, and human resources.  He said the GOP had tried to avoid voting for the May 8 vote that adopted the G-77 resolution, but because the divide between western countries and the G-77 was so wide, Pakistan did not have a choice.  2. (SBU) On the upcoming NAM meeting, Siddiqui thought the topic of UN reform would not come up.  This issue had been discussed before, with the NAM issuing an outcome document in which a chapter broadly touched on institutional reform at the UN.  He did not believe that delegations would be eager to touch on this issue again this time around. CROCKER

The governmetn's mid-May revelation of a new strategy for the FATA (ref A) is potentially a major step forward, but the proof will lie in its implementation. CROCKER

(C/NF) Summary:  In an introductory call with the Ambassador on May 25, recently appointed Minister for Women's Development and Youth Affairs Sumaira Malik provided an overview of her key programmatic priorities, offering new and valuable areas for immediate and medium-term USG assistance. Malik assured the Ambassador that her top priority is repeal of discriminatory provisions of the Hudood Ordinances and further reform of honor killing legislation.  The Ministry has already launched a surreptitious campaign to generate public demand on these issues intended to gin up legislative support.  Complementing this campaign, the Ministry intends to embark shortly on awareness-raising activities designed to highlight women's rights and highlight full participation of women in Pakistani society.  Recognizing the importance of improving protection for victims of violence against women, Malik intends to expand the Ministry's 20 crisis centers to every district of the country and establish a 24-hour hotline through which victims can seek the centers' support.  Centers would be tied-in with the newly established crime cell in the Interior Ministry, which would assume responsibility for investigation of cases of violence against women. Emphasizing the need for economic empowerment of women, Malik discussed Ministry plans to establish skills centers and micro-credit schemes along the lines of the Grameen Bank to promote female entrepreneurship.  Malik was eager for USG cooperation in these priority areas, and post believes these offer viable avenues to channel both immediate funds available from DRL and future funds from USAID.  End Summary.  Repealing Discriminatory Legislation  2. (C/NF) In a May 25 meeting with the Ambassador, Minister of Women's Development and Youth Affairs Sumaira Malik emphasized the high priority she placed on prompt repeal of the remaining discriminatory legislation against women, including the Hudood Ordinances.  Malik stated that any legislation that is un-Islamic and/or that violates women's human rights had to go.  She shared that the Ministry was working in concert with private television channels to launch a below-the-radar campaign to build support both for Hudood Ordinance repeal and Honor Killing Law reform.  At the Ministry's request, private television channels had begun airing debates and news editorials on these issues to generate public awareness on and demand for the reform of this legislation.  Private television station Geo has also purchased public service announcements in local English language daily The News, highlighting the need for Hudood Ordinance repeal.  Through this public awareness and education strategy, Malik hopes to blunt the inevitable criticism that will come from Islamist quarters once the bills are introduced.  The Ministry intends to introduce the bills in the National Assembly following conclusion of the budget session that takes place in June.  Improving Victim Protection  3. (C/NF) Malik admitted that local police have a poor track record on and little experience in the proper handling of cases of violence against women and that the federal government needed to do a better job of protection of victims of such crimes.  At present, the Ministry operates 20 crisis centers that provide basic assistance and referral services for victims of violence against women.  These centers exist principally in urban areas and their efficacy varies dramatically.  Malik has obtained funds in the current budgetary cycle to expand the number of these centers and ensure that all are equipped, at a minimum, to provide free legal counseling services.  Ultimately, Malik intends to establish a crisis center in each district, providing a full range of victim counseling and support services.   ISLAMABAD 00009711  002.2 OF 003   4. (C/NF) As a first step to improving victim access to these centers, the Ministry is launching a 24-hour helpline the week of May 29.  This will connect victims directly to center staff who can provide immediate assistance in dealing with local law enforcement and obtaining protection.  Malik is working with the Interior Ministry to have helpline staff linked to the newly established crime cell.  Once this happens, the crime cell would assume responsibility for violence against women cases from local police services. Malik argued this would ensure better handling of such cases by trained police personnel and would prevent local influentials (feudal landlords, tribal chiefs, jirgas) from interfering in the investigation.  Economic Empowerment  5. (C/NF) Arguing that the GOP had done a great deal for the political empowerment of women (i.e., increased representation in legislative bodies at all levels), the next critical step is the economic empowerment of women.  As a first step, Malik highlighted that in the upcoming budget she had secured funds to provide development money to local women councillors.  This will enable them to launch appropriate women's development schemes in their districts.  In addition, the Ministry is keen to examine possible federal support, including the establishment of skills training centers and micro-credit schemes similar to the Grameen Bank.  In this way, female entrepreneurship could be promoted.  Malik also expressed strong support for women's quotas.  Ten percent of government civil service jobs have recently been set aside for women, and the Ministry is now pressing the private sector to follow suit.  Publicizing female entrepreneurs will help convince other women that they too can participate actively in the economic/business sectors.  Public Relations  6. (C/NF) Malik was highly critical of her predecessors' moribund public relations strategy that she claimed had failed to highlight the government's positive steps towards women's empowerment, lacked a strong public education message, and allowed an inaccurate picture of the country to be portrayed in the western media.  Malik argued that a more proactive strategy could address these deficiencies.  After the conclusion of the budget debate in June, Malik intends to launch a strategy that would include mass education for women (and men) about women's rights and opportunities through media and direct public meetings.  As part of the strategy, the Ministry would highlight the achievements of successful women in the business, political, and academic fields and encourage others to follow in their footsteps.  The Ambassador also encouraged Malik to highlight victims of abuse as part of the strategy in order to educate others about their experiences.  Malik requested USG assistance in trying to change the negative image about women's rights in Pakistan in the western media.  Ambassador noted that positive attention by the GOP in the area's discussed previously would no doubt receive substantial western media coverage.  Comment  7. (C/NF) Post feels strongly that the best way to promote women's rights in Pakistan is through direct, continuous engagement with the government.  In the new Women's Development Minister, we have a constructive counterpart who has both a vision and concrete plans that can help to improve women's human rights in this country.  Providing assistance to one or more of the various initiatives that she has identified as her priorities would have a significant impact.  We urge that immediate resources identified by DRL and medium-term resources projected by USAID should be utilized in support of the government's overall initiatives, rather  ISLAMABAD 00009711  003.2 OF 003   than one-off projects through NGOs or individuals.  This would help to ensure sustainability, give us greater leverage over government policies in this area, encourage business participation in the proposed economic development projects, and allow us to multiply our limited resources with counterpart funding from the GOP.  As an initial focus of our program, we would recommend that DRL funds be used to support the Ministry in the upgrade of a select number of women's crisis centers to provide full counseling and assistance services, as well as to establish a credible working relationship between the centers and the Ministry of Interior's crime cell.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (S)  Per SCA request (ref A), post offers this summary of Pakistani military operations in Balochistan in support of CFC-A Operation Mountain Thrust.  2.  (S)  On May 20, Coalition Joint Task Force (CJTF-76) and the Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) representatives met with Pakistan GHQ Military Operations (MO) Directorate and 12th Corps to coordinate Coalition and Pak Mil operations for Operation Mountain Thrust.  Pak Mil said it would assign a regular Army brigade and 15 Baloch Frontier Corps (BFC) wings, as well as establish additional border posts to be staffed jointly by regular Army and (BFC) troops.  Pak Mil will dedicate artillery, two battalion-size Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) and the BFC will request dedicated rotary wing aviation assets from the Ministry of Interior.  Pak Mil's conceives a series of static posts, mobile checkpoints and QRFs divided into 6 sectors running from Zabol to Nimroz border area.  U.S. and Pak Mil agreed that all the commanders involved in Operation Mountain Thrust will attend the southern Tripartite Commission (TPC) Border Security Sub-Committee Meeting on May 29, at which a schedule of flag meetings to coordinate details of the operation will be discussed.  3.  (S)  During the May 20 meeting, Pak Mil briefed that they have named their support Operation Nagehban (Guardian).  As Pak Mil's analysis of 3 key crossing areas matches CJTF-76s analysis, these will be the focal points for Pak Mil operations:  Q.D.K Sector  (opposite Zabol/ Maruf District)-- 1st key crossing site: 3 x FC Wings 31 x Posts in place 7 x new posts to be established 10 x QRFs to be established  BOLAN SECTOR:  (Between Maruf and Spin Buldak) 2 x wings 13 x posts 6 x QRFs and 10 x posts to be established 1 x Regular Army Inf Battalion (minus 2 x Companies) to be added  PISHIN SECTOR (Spin Buldak)-- 2nd key crossing site 4 x wings 74 x posts 12 x QRFs to be established 1 x Regular Army Inf Battalion to be added  CHAGAI SECTOR:  (Between Spin Buldak and Bara Cha) 3 x wings 28 x posts 3 x QRFs and 11 x posts to be established  DALBANDIN SECTOR  (Opposite Bara Cha)-- 3rd key crossing site 1 x wing 1 x new wing to be established 13 x posts (with 12 more to be established) 4 x QRFs to be established  KHARAN SECTOR:  (moves western part of Helmand to Nirmroz) 4 x wings  (only 1 x wing on AFG border) 35 x posts 2 x QRFs to be established  4.

Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  1.  (C)  In response to inquiries via State and Defense Department channels (Reftel), post has confirmed through the British High Commmision (BHC) and Danish Defense Command Representatives that Danish military cargo transiting Pakistan en route to Afghanistan was successfully offloaded at Karachi on 22 May.  The Danes discharged 33 flat racks of vehicles, 2 empty flat racks, and 247 containers.  The first truck convoy transporting the cargo to the Pak-Afghan border en route to Kandahar departed Karachi just after midnight on Thursday, May 25 via commercial transporter "Secure Packers"; the BHC estimates that the convoy will reach the border crossing at Chaman in four or five days.  The BHC estimates that the convoys transporting the Danish cargo will depart Karachi over the next six days.  A three-member Danish team will remain in Karachi to oversee the cargo until the last transport convoy reaches Afghanistan.  2. (C)  As this cargo will support Danish troops assigned to the British battle group in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, the BHC agreed to facilitate the transit after the Pakistani Embassy in Copenhagen denied a Danish request for a National Logistics Cell exemption authorizing transport via a private commercial carrier.  (Note:  The request had been forwarded through the Pakistani Embassy as the Danish Embassy in Islamabad had been closed following violent anti-cartoon demonstrations in February 2006.  End note)  Working in coordination with post's Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan (ODRP) and the Netherlands Defense Attache, the BHC served as a liaison between the Danes and the GOP bureaucracy. After a recent meeting attended by visiting members of the Danish Defense Command and the BHC with Pakistani's Joint Staff HQ and Ministry of Defense, the BHC stressed that failure to issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the Danes permitting the use of the commercial carrier would lead to unacceptable delays, undermining ISAF's deployment in Helmand and endangering the lives of British and  Danish troops.  The Danes received the NOC midday May 25; the first transport convoy departed Karachi approximately twelve hours later.  3. (C)  Comment:  The BHC's willingness to facilitate the transit of this shipment offers an excellent example of ISAF cooperation.  Thanks to its intervention, the Danish cargo cleared the port and was on the road according to the original deployment timeline.          CROCKER 
UNCLAS ISLAMABAD 009875  SIPDIS  SIPDIS  E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: AMGT, AORC, ASEC, ENRG, KNNP, OTRA, PK SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORY STAFF JOSE R. RODRIGUEZ AND JAMES W. PURVIS  REF: STATE 77262  1.  Post welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Sandia National Laboratories' staff Jose R. Rodriguez and James W. Purvis from June 10 to 16.  The purpose of the visit is to participate in an IAEA training course in Islamabad. Post understands that IAEA's local partner, the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority, will arrange for travelers' accomodations at the Marriott Hotel and will provide transportation to/from course events each day.  2.  Control officer for the visit will be Theresa Grencik. She can be reached at the following numbers: Embassy: 92-51-208-0000 Office: 92-51-208-2294 Cell: 92 300 856 4708 Email:  grencikta@state.gov  3.  An Embassy car and driver and expediter will meet visitors upon arrival at the airport in Islamabad. Transportation will be provided to the airport on the day of departure.  Please inform control officer of any change in itinerary.  4.   Visitors must/must obtain separate post clearance if they plan to visit any of the three Mission Pakistan consulates (Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore) or any other areas under the jurisdiction of the consulates.  Most travel outside of Islamabad will require separate post clearance. Post clearance for the consulates should be requested via cable to the consulate(s) on the planned itinerary.  5. Visas: Everyone arriving in Pakistan must/must have a valid visa.  If you do not have a valid visa, you will be denied entry.  If you will be in Pakistan on TDY for more than 30 days, ensure that you have a multiple entry visa that shows &Work at the U.S. Embassy8 or &Official Business8 as the purpose of your visit.  If your visa does not contain this language, your visa cannot be extended or renewed while in Pakistan and you will have to physically leave the country to renew or extend it.  6.  Electronic Equipment:  Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of any USG provided electronic or photographic equipment (to include laptops/electronic notebooks), and receive RSO authorization prior to introducing the equipment into the Chancery.  No connectivity is allowed to State's unclassified or classified networks.  Personal electronic or  SIPDIS photographic equipment as well as camera/video capable cell phones are not permitted in the Chancery.  7.  Security:  Islamabad and the three constituent consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar are high-threat posts. Employees assigned to Pakistan are unaccompanied and receive danger pay.  The Department of State Travel Warning for Pakistan asks U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan because of the continued high security concerns about terrorists in Pakistan.  The Embassy approves only essential official travel to Pakistan.  All official visitors to Islamabad must adhere to Embassy security standards and procedures, and those staying more than one week must attend a security briefing held every Tuesday at 10 a.m.  TDY travel outside of Islamabad requires RSO clearance.  Travelers to the consulates must follow RSO consulate security procedures.  The potential for continued threats to Americans in Pakistan from Al-Qaida and other extremist elements remains real.  A car bomb damaged the U.S. consulate in Karachi in June 2002 and killed several by-standers.  A grenade attack against the Protestant International Church in Islamabad killed two Embassy members and injured several others in March 2002. American, Western, and Christian targets continue to be threatened and attacked.  Anti-Americanism remains strong among certain elements of the population.  For further information about travel to Pakistan, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet for Pakistan, available via the internet at http://travel.state.gov.  8.  Hotel Security:  Security at major hotels in Pakistan has been generally good.  However, extremist elements know that westerners stay in and congregate at these hotels as evinced by the May 2002 car bomb attack outside the Sheraton hotel in Karachi that killed nearly a dozen French submarine engineers.  As well, an October 2004 there was a recent bombing in the lobby of at the Islamabad Marriott that injured a number of people, several seriously.  A.  Post uses the Serena and Marriott Hotels for TDY visitors.  Based on our continuing review of the security  programs at both hotels, they may continue to be used to house short-term (seven days or less) TDY visitors.  All agencies and sections that sponsor long-term TDY personnel (eight days or longer) must move their personnel from one hotel to the other after the seventh day and should consider, where possible, the use of guest houses, residences currently occupied by PCS or TDY employees of their agency or section, or houses rented expressly for the use of long-term TDY personnel. B.  The guidelines below must be followed by all short-term TDY personnel (seven days or less): --  TDY personnel should minimize the time they spend in the hotel lobby and adjoining areas. --  TDY personnel should establish a transportation schedule and adhere to it.  They should not congregate in the lobby area waiting for transportation, but should arrive in the lobby for pick-up approximately one minute before scheduled departure. --  The Marriott Hotel has a private dining room for Embassy visitor use.  Buffet breakfast service will be available there.  TDY personnel are also encouraged to take lunch or dinner there, ordered directly from one of the restaurants located in the hotel.  There is no extra charge for this service.  Room service is also available at no extra charge. --  TDY personnel should report any security concerns directly and immediately to the Regional Security Office.  C.  The Serena and the Marriott have been instructed to house Embassy personnel in the backside away from the main roads that run adjacent to the front/main entrances of the hotels. Also, since fire fighting is not up to U.S. standards, post recommends that TDY personnel stay on lower floors in the hotels and familiarize themselves with the emergency exits on theirs floors immediately after check-in.  Valuables such as money or jewelry should also not be left behind or hidden in the room.  9.  Public Transportation: for safety reasons, Americans are prohibited from using taxis and all public transportation. The Embassy requires that official visitors use its motor pool. Emergency telephone numbers:  American Embassy Islamabad        92-51-208-0000 Marine Security Guard (24 hrs)    92-51-208-2338 Regional Security Office          92-51-208-2203/2204 American Consulate Karachi        92-021-568-5170 American Consulate Peshawar       92-091-527-9801 American Consulate Lahore         92-042-603-4000  10.  Embassy Motor Pool Services:  Post maintains a 24-hour motor pool.  However, the demands on the motor pool have increased considerably since September 2001 and motor pool services may not be immediately available when you need them.  Accordingly, Post strongly urges all TDYers either to provide a fund cite in their travel orders or come with sufficient resources in hand for the purpose of renting a vehicle and driver (if necessary).  The Procurement Section at Post can assist TDYers with vehicle rentals.  Motor Pool cars and drivers are available for airport pick up and drop-offs.  An International Driver,s License is not valid in Pakistan.  11. Health:  The Embassy Health Unit has provided the following information to aid visitors and temporary duty employees in Pakistan:  A. Facilities:  There are health units at the embassy and each of the three consulates.  The Islamabad Health unit is staffed by a Regional Medical Officer, a Foreign Service Nurse Practitioner and two RNs.  It provides routine medical care and basic laboratory services during the workweek.  It does not supply medications for chronic medical conditions; these must be brought with you.  The facilities in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar are extremely limited in the services they provide and are staffed by part-time local medical providers.  Official visitors traveling to or working at those locations should bring all personal medicines with them including over-the-counter drugs.  B. Access: Access to the Health Units at all Mission Pakistan posts other than  good samaritan, care is limited to American citizen employees and contractors who are eligible for Health Unit services.  Good samaritan care is emergency care designed to stabilize a patient until s/he can reach or be reached by local medical practitioners.  The following American citizen employees and contractors are ineligible/ineligible for Health Unit services:  NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (COMMERCIAL) CONTRACTORS  DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO PAKISTAN without a current medical clearance from the Department of State,s Office of Medical Services (MED).  TDY DIRECT HIRE EMPLOYEES ABROAD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS IN A CALENDAR YEAR without a current MED clearance.  PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS (PSCs) unless all of the following conditions have been met:  --  The PSC has a current MED clearance.  --  The PSC,s contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.  --  The employing agency is paying for medical services under ICASS and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.  Agencies should review personal services contracts BEFORE the arrival of PSCs to determine the status of Health Unit access and must inform the Health Unit of eligible PSCs before they arrive.  PSCs must submit documentation proving eligibility for services to the Health Unit.  The Health Unit can provide a copy of the Health Unit Handbook to employees and contractors who are ineligible for services.  The Handbook contains a list of physicians to whom the Health Unit refers patients and a list of acceptable hospital facilities and pharmacies in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.  C.  Food and Water-borne Illnesses:  Visitors to Pakistan are at high risk for water-borne and gastrointestinal illnesses. Careful attention to the choice of food and beverages helps to reduce the risks.  Avoid salad bars and buffets while eating at local restaurants; a la carte items are your safest bet.  Meat, eggs, and vegetables should always be thoroughly cooked or steamed.  Safe foods include steaming hot dishes, rice, pasta, cooked vegetables served hot, and bread products.  Foods that are moist and served at room temperature, especially peeled fruits, salads, sauces, egg-based foods, mayonnaise-based dishes and buffet offerings are risky.  Avoid ice cream as well.  D.  Drinks:  Safe drinks include hot tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages.  Assume all tap water is contaminated contrary to notices occasionally posted in some hotels or elsewhere.  The only exception to this rule is the tap water on the embassy compound.  Commercially available water bottled in Pakistan has been found to be inconsistently safe for consumption.  Bottled water sold in our commissary has been judged safe.  Be sure the seals have not been broken. Remember that freezing does not make water safe, so avoid ice cubes unless you know they have been made from potable water.  Personal portable water purification systems are available commercially at nominal cost and can easily be transported in luggage as they are no larger than a tall mug.  These devices protect against bacteria as well as viruses and protozoa.  E.  Malaria:  Malaria is endemic to various regions in Pakistan, and the risks of infection vary depending on location, altitude and season.  During the rainy season all visitors are advised to take prophylaxis, especially those traveling outside the major metropolitan centers or who make frequent trips between the consulates and Embassy. Mefloquine is the preferred prophylaxis and should be brought with you during travel as it is unavailable in country except at the mission health units.  Doxycycline is an alternative and is available in country.  In conjunction with medication, visitors must also take measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, such as wearing clothing that covers most of the body and using an insect repellent containing DEET.  F.  Immunizations:  Visitor immunization records should be reviewed by the Department,s Immunization Clinic prior to departure.  For short-term visitors the following immunizations are recommended: hepatitis a, hepatitis b, typhoid, and tetanus in addition to usual childhood immunizations.  The rabies series is also recommended for Pakistan and should be completed before arriving in country. The Health Unit in Islamabad can provide most vaccinations except smallpox, which is only available in Washington.  The consulate health units can provide a limited number of vaccinations depending on type needed and health unit staffing.  G.  All TDY travelers are urged to take annual flu vaccination before international travel.  Vaccine will not be available after the current vaccination program is complete in November.  Tamiflu, the flu treatment drug, is not  available in country.  If travelers wish to obtain supplies for travel, they will need to consult their local provider in the U.S. for a supply prior to travel to Pakistan.  H.  Emergency Medical Services: Emergency medical care is extremely limited in Pakistan even in major cities.  The health units keep up-to-date lists of available facilities in cities in which the embassy and consulates are located. Travelers should arrange for medical evacuation insurance either personally or through their sponsoring agency prior to their arrival in country.  I.  Automobile and Pedestrian Safety: Overseas automobile accidents remain a major cause of death of expatriates abroad and Pakistan is no exception.  Further, vehicles in Pakistan are driven on the left side of the road, which adds another dimension to automobile and pedestrian safety if you are not used to this traffic pattern.  Avoid driving at night if at all possible.  Use seat belts in both rear and front seats, and insist that your driver maintains a safe speed.  Stay alert crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.  CROCKER

(A) ISLAMABAD 9704      B. (B) ISLAMABAD 9472  ISLAMABAD 00009890  001.2 OF 003   Classified By: Derived from DSCG 05-01, b and d.  1. (S/NF) Summary: Electoral strategies for Pakistan's major parties are coalescing in advance of the likely late 2007/early 2008 national and provincial elections.  At this stage, most parties, save the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), have adopted a go-it-alone strategy.  The ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML), while leaving the door open to seat adjustments and post-electoral coalitions, appears to be ruling out any form of pre-election agreement with other parties, including its current coalition partners.  While the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has made much of reconciliation with the PML-N through the Charter for Democracy, its in-country leaders have consistently ruled out electoral alliances with that party and continue to stall on any possible agreement with the PML.  We understand from British contacts that perceptions of declining international support for Musharraf may be influencing exiled PPP leader Benazir Bhutto's decision to go-slow on a pre-electoral overture to the PML.  Benazir is basing this erroneous view largely on recent USG statements critical of Musharraf's counter-terrorism performance, which she interprets as the USG dumping Musharraf in her favor.  Senior PML officials share a similar interpretation.  This has the potential to derail efforts at pre-electoral rapprochement between the parties and free and fair elections.  End Summary.  Pakistan Muslim League  2. (S/NF) Senior PML officials have reiterated to post over the last week that the party has taken a strategic decision to contest the next elections without any alliances.  The party President and Secretary General (refs) have specifically ruled out any pre-electoral deal with the PPP. Seat adjustments with the PPP, JUI-F, and ANP in select districts (principally in NWFP and Balochistan) are under consideration.  Broader alliances with members of the ruling coalition, the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), Pakistan Muslim League-Functional (PML-F), PPP-Sherpao, and PPP-Patriots, are reportedly not.  PML leaders expect the MQM and PML-F to contest independently in Sindh but to rejoin any post-election PML-led alliance.  Seat adjustments with PPP-Sherpao in NWFP are under consideration.  PML leaders expect that if PPP-Patriots refuse to join the PML fold, they stand little chance of reelection.  Pakistan People's Party  3. (S/NF) The in-country leadership of the PPP also appears to be adopting a unilateral election strategy -- its public embrace of the Charter for Democracy notwithstanding.  In private discussions over the last several months, rhetoric from senior leaders, including Chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim, has subtly shifted from pleas for USG assistance in brokering an electoral understanding with the PML to requests simply for a level playing field on which the party can challenge Musharraf.  Unlike their PML counterparts, PPP leaders are not basing their strategy on realistic calculations of electoral potential.  Rather, they are relying on a vague, and possibly inaccurate, perception of Musharraf's declining domestic support.  British diplomats suggest that this PPP analysis has been reinforced by Benazir Bhutto's belief that USG support for Musharraf has declined, obviating any need for her to cut a deal. In such a scenario, PPP leaders believe that the PML vote bank will collapse, ensuring them an easy victory over their ostensible ally the weaker PML-N -- a party with which PPP leaders have made clear they have no intention of governing.  Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz   ISLAMABAD 00009890  002.2 OF 003   4. (S/NF) The PML-N recognizes that it enters the next elections in a weak position with many of its members having defected to the PML and its traditional supporters divided. Its leaders are wagering the party's future on the Charter for Democracy and wide-ranging seat adjustments with the PPP.  The party hopes to form a de facto anti-Musharraf coalition that will give it access to the PPP's broader support base and prevent a head-to-head contest with its far stronger traditional rival.  Party leaders believe that if Nawaz Sharif can burnish his "democratic" credentials, the PML-N can capture enough of the anti-military, urban, middle-class vote in Punjab to position itself as the preeminent center-right party for future contests.  Like the PPP, the PML-N strategy presumes a weakening Musharraf and international support.  In recent meetings PML-N leaders including Chairman Raja Zafar-ul-Haq have sought USG support for a PPP-PML-N electoral understanding against Musharraf. In this vein, the PML-N leaders have promised no coalition with the JI, cited the anti-American sentiments of some PPP leaders, and denigrated any PML role in future politics.  Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal  5. (S/NF) The MMA is already a coalition divided with its strongest two parties pursuing independent and contradictory electoral strategies.  The JI has made clear its desire to form a broad anti-Musharraf coalition with the PPP and PML-N to "force" the President from office.  JI believes that it can position itself at the center of any such campaign, thereby building its support base and placing future PPP and PML-N governments in its debt.  Unlike JI, which believes it can capture an increased share of power, the JUI-F is solely interested in keeping the power it has gained in NWFP and Balochistan.  PML, PPP, and PML-N leaders have all reported Fazl-ur-Rehman's willingness to work with the election winner for an acceptable price.  With the two main parties pursuing their own competing agendas, the relevance of the MMA as a coalition will likely continue to fade, even if formally retained for public relations reasons.  The Nationalists  6. (S/NF) The smaller nationalist parties (save the Baloch which are entirely consumed with provincial strife) seem to be positioning themselves for a hung parliament.  Their strategies focus on building working relationships with all three main parties -- PML, PPP, and PML-N -- enabling them to enter coalition with whosoever obtains a plurality.  The ANP has proven most adept so far at this strategy.  While still retaining close ties with the PML-N and PPP through the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, ANP leader Asfandyar Wali Khan has recently repaired relations with Musharraf, opening possible avenues for cooperation.  All three main parties now see the ANP as a possible partner for seat adjustments and post-electoral coalitions.  The MQM would like to be in a similar position.  Deputy Convenor Farooq Sattar has repeatedly stressed that the MQM will contest the upcoming elections independently and not/not with the PML.  Sattar has attempted to adopt an independent line from the GOP on key issues like provincial autonomy and unsuccessfully to court the PML-N and PPP.  Indeed, MQM has sought USG assistance in repairing its relations with these parties.  The International Role  7. (S/NF) The potential role of the international community, particularly the United States, figures prominently in parties' calculations.  There is an increasing perception among opposition politicians that the USG has decided to dump Musharraf in favor of one of the former civilian prime ministers.  While much of this reflects wishful thinking in light of USG commitments to free and fair elections, recent statements critical of Musharraf's counterterrorism efforts  ISLAMABAD 00009890  003.2 OF 003   coupled with Pakistan sensitivities to the U.S. civil nuclear initiative have increased this view.  Conversations with in-country leaders of both parties and British reporting on recent conversations with Benazir Bhutto suggest that this perception is a large factor in refusals to conclude a deal with Musharraf.  More troubling still are indications that senior PML officials have reached a similar conclusion.  In a recent conversation with PML Secretary General Mushahid Hussain, poloffs were informed of concern within the PML that the USG was abandoning Musharraf in favor of Benazir Bhutto. He expressed relief when assured that this was not the case and that the USG interest was in promoting fair elections, not endorsing any individual or party.  Comment  8. (S/NF) To a degree it appears that parties are calculating election strategies on the basis of inaccurately perceived intentions of the international community.  While we will continue to dispel actively any suggestion of declining USG support for the government or U.S. endorsement of Bhutto, we must remember that all parties read more into their interpretations of our behavior than our direct denials on these matters.  In this vein, any public suggestion of USG dissatisfaction with Musharraf's role in the GWOT, an area in which we have previously offered visible praise, will be taken as a withdrawal of overall support.  This will stymie GOP efforts to conclude an understanding with like-minded parties (PPP and ANP) prior to the election -- probably the best formula for a moderate, stable government after 2007. In a worst-case scenario, if Musharraf feels the international community has abandoned him, he may withdraw his endorsement of a free and fair election and allow massive rigging circa 2002.  This would not only be a massive set-back for democratization, but would also deny Musharraf the legitimacy and popular mandate his future government needs to pursue aggressively controversial counter-terrorism programs.

ISLAMABAD 9499      B. ISLAMABAD 9033  Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d)  (S)  Over the Memorial Day weekend, Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri offer a read out of the May 26 meeting between President Musharraf and Iranian First Vice President Davoudi (ref A).  According to Kasuri, Musharraf told the visitors that Iran should stop all efforts to enrich uranium now, adding that Tehran' current policy was making life difficult for its neighbor, Pakistan. After offering a long justification of Iran's right to pursue a civilian nuclear energy program in the call on Musharraf, Davoudi privately told Kasuri that Iran is considering all options on the issue.  Kasuri interpreted this to mean that the notion of cessation remains on the table.  Kasuri also told the Ambassador that the Iranians' discussions here, as in the earlier talks in Bali (ref B), left him with the impression that Iran is eager to hold direct talks with the U.S. CROCKER

MFA again requested that the London seminar be scheduled in the latter half of July.  With regard to other programs, Kamran has advised relevant GOP agencies that nominations for the Interdiction Training and Equipment programs in South Carolina (November 2006) and Texas (December 2006)  must be submitted before the end of June 2006, to allow sufficient time for the participants to apply for U.S. visas.  4.

Post understands that the Disarmament Cell has been instructed by senior MFA officials to pursue EXBS cooperation with the U.S.; we believe that the Disarmament Cell will be able to facilitate GOP participation in the events currently scheduled by ISN/ECC.  Post looks forward to working with ISN/ECC on ensuring that the current schedule of programs is a success.  CROCKER
