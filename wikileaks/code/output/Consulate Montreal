E.0. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: TBIO, ECON, KIRF, CA, Health 
SUBJECT: CLONING CLAIM PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON QUEBEC-BASED 
RAELIAN GROUP 
 
1. SUMMARY: THE FOLLOWING IS SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
THE MONTREAL-BASED RAELIAN GROUP, WHOSE MEMBER DR. BRIGITTE 
BOISSELIER ANNOUNCED AT A DECEMBER 27 PRESS CONFERENCE IN 
HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST CLONED HUMAN 
BEING, A 7 POUND BABY GIRL NICKNAMED EVE. AND ITS TWO MAIN 
FIGURES LEADER CLAUDE VORILHON, BETTER KNOWN AS RAEL, AND 
DR. BOISSELIER.  ONE LIKELY RESULT OF THE BOISSELIER 
ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT CANADA\'S PENDING LEGISLATION TO BAN 
HUMAN CLONING COULD CONTAIN STRICTER RESTRICTIONS. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. THE RAELIAN MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED BY FRENCHMAN CLAUDE 
VORILHON, A FORMER SPORTS JOURNALIST, FAILED SINGER, RADIO 
COMMENTATOR AND AVID STOCK CAR RACER. VORILHON CLAIMS TO 
HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED ON DECEMBER 25, 1945, BY A FRENCH MOTHER 
AND AN ALIEN FATHER. SPECIALISTS SAY HE WAS BORN IN VICHY, 
FRANCE IN 1946. VORILHON WHO USES THE NAME RAEL  (GOD\'S 
LIGHT) (PRONOUNCED RA-EL IN FRENCH (RHYMES WITH KAL-EL AND 
JOR-EL)) SAYS HE CREATED THE MOVEMENT AFTER ALIENS VISITED 
HIM IN CENTRAL FRANCE IN 1973. AT THAT TIME, LITTLE GREEN 
ALIENS (APPROXIMATELY 4 FT TALL) TOLD HIM --IN FLUENT FRENCH- 
- EARTHLINGS HAD BEEN CREATED IN A LABORATORY 25,000 YEARS 
AGO. SINCE THESE ALIENS WHICH HE CALLS THE ELOHIM (THE 
HEBREW WORD FOR GOD) ARE 25,000 YEARS AHEAD OF US, RAEL SAYS 
CLONING IS VERY SIMPLE TASK FOR THEM. 
 
3. ALTHOUGH THE SECT IS BASED IN MONTREAL--AND NOT 
SWITZERLAND AS THE BRITISH TABLOID PRESS HAS REPORTED --RAEL 
MOVED HIS PERSONAL HEADQUARTERS TO FLORIDA IN THE EARLY 
NINETIES. WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED RAEL WAS MOVING TO FLORIDA, 
RADIO COMMENTATORS JOKED HE WAS SIMPLY IMITATING QUEBEC 
SNOWBIRDS OR THAT HE WANTED TO GET CLOSER TO NASCAR 
CIRCUITS. HOWEVER, SOME SAW U.S. EXPANSION AS A LOGICAL 
BUSINESS MOVE. ON THE ONE HAND, SINCE THE 1960S, QUEBEC HAS 
PROVEN TO BE TOUGH RECRUITING GROUNDS FOR ALL RELIGIOUS 
GROUPS, MAINSTREAM OR OTHERWISE. ON THE OTHER, THE U.S. 
OFFERS MUCH BIGGER POOLS OF MONEY AND TARGET AUDIENCES FOR 
RAELIAN COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. BECAUSE THE GROUP IS 
RECOGNIZED AS AN ATHEIST RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION BY THE 
QUEBEC GOVERNMENT IT ENJOYS THE SAME FISCAL ADVANTAGES AS 
OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS. 
 
4.  THE GROUP OPERATES A THEME PARK CALLED UFO LAND IN 
QUEBEC\'S EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AREA. THE FACILITY, WHICH 
CONSISTS MAINLY OF A LARGE FLYING SAUCER, A LARGE-SCALE DNA 
MOLECULE AND SOME ROOMS FOR SUMMER SEMINARS AND MEDIA 
INTERVIEWS, WAS RECENTLY VANDALIZED BUT IS SCHEDULED TO 
REOPEN THIS SUMMER. 
 
5. IN PHOTOS AND TELEVISION APPEARANCES, RAEL SURROUNDS 
HIMSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. RAELIAN MEDIA KITS INCLUDE 
MANY PICTURES OF SCANTILY DRESSED \"MEMBERS.\" RAEL PREACHES 
\"SENSUAL MEDITATION\" WHICH ENABLES THE FAITHFUL TO REACH THE 
\"COSMIC ORGASM.\" 
 
6. DESPITE THE SECT\'S TWO POWERFUL MARKETING TOOLS, SEX AND 
UFOS, THE RAELIANS HAVE VERY FEW MEMBERS.   THEIR WEB SITE 
WWW.RAEL.ORG CLAIMS -IN TWENTY LANGUAGES-- TO HAVE 55,000 
MEMBERS IN 84 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER MIKE KROPVELD, EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR OF THE MONTREAL-BASED INFO-SECTE (NO RELATION WITH 
THE PARIS ORGANIZATION OF THE SAME NAME) TOLD POST THAT THE 
RAELIANS INFLATE THEIR FIGURES WITH PAST AND OCCASIONAL 
MEMBERS. BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEDIA ATTENTION, THE GROUP 
CREATES A LOT OF CURIOSITY -A RAEL SPOKESMAN STATED IN THE 
LOCAL PRESS ON DECEMBER 30 THAT THE WEBSITE WAS GETTING ONE 
MILLION HITS PER HOUR ON DECEMBER 26 -- BUT MOST VISITORS 
ONLY ATTEND A FEW MEETINGS. THE ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IS BETWEEN 
2,000 AND 3,000 WORLDWIDE AND ABOUT 700 IN MONTREAL, SAYS 
KROPVELD. 
 
7. ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEWS ANALYSTS, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF 
RAELIANS IS TO CREATE LIFE IN A LABORATORY WHICH WOULD MAKE 
HUMAN BEINGS IMMORTAL AND ENABLE THEM TO CREATE ANOTHER 
CIVILIZATION ON ANOTHER PLANET. IN THE MEANTIME, RAEL WANTS 
TO BUILD AN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL TO WELCOME THE ELOHIM WHEN 
THEY COME BACK IN 2035. THE GROUP HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICIZED 
FOR ADVOCATING THE USE OF GENETICS FOR EUGENIC ATTEMPTS AT 
IMPROVING THE HUMAN RACE. THE GROUP\'S STRUCTURE WITH PRIESTS 
AND BISHOPS IS BASED ALONG THE LINES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
 
8. UNTIL RECENTLY THE GROUP AVOIDED SERIOUS CONTROVERSY. 
THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY STORIES OF FORMER MEMBERS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT BEING CONNED OUT OF THEIR MONEY OR 
PHYSICALLY ABUSED OR SEDUCED, AND NO INVOLVEMENT WITH MINORS 
-- EXCEPT ONE CASE IN FRANCE. 
 
9.  NONETHELESS, THE RAELIANS KNOW HOW TO PIGGYBACK ON 
STORIES TO GET PUBLICITY. WHEN IN 1993, AUTHORITIES IN 
QUEBEC DECIDED AGAINST INSTALLING CONDOM DISTRIBUTORS IN 
SCHOOLS, RAELIANS VISITED THE KIDS WITH FREE SAMPLES. IN THE 
WAKE OF THE RECENT PEDOPHILE CHARGES AGAINST VARIOUS 
RELIGIOUS ORDERS, THE GROUP WENT BACK TO THE SCHOOLS IN 
QUEBEC. THEIR PLAN THIS TIME WAS TO HAND OUT SMALL WOODEN 
CROSSES FOR THE STUDENTS TO BURN. BUT PUBLIC AND 
GOVERNMENTAL OPPOSITION STOPPED THE LATER PROJECT. IN BOTH 
CASES, ALMOST ALL THE PUBLICITY THEY GARNERED WAS BAD. 
 
10. SENSING A SIMILAR WAVE OF CONDEMNATION, RAEL HAS 
PUBLICLY DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM DR. BOISSELIER, A RAELIAN 
BISHOP, AND HER CLONING WORK, SAYING HE HAD GOTTEN RID OF 
CLONAID TWO YEARS AGO. HOWEVER, KROPVELD BELIEVES THAT 
CLONING IS BY FAR THE GROUP\'S MOST DANGEROUS WORK. KROPFELD 
EVEN DOUBTS RAEL REALLY BELIEVES IN CLONING HUMAN BEINGS 
BEYOND ITS MARKETING POSSIBILITIES FOR HIMSELF AS SECT 
LEADER. 
 
11. AS FOR DR BRIGITTE BOISSELIER, SHE WAS BORN IN 1956 IN 
FRANCE. SHE HOLDS TWO PHDS IN CHEMISTRY, ONE FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF DIJON IN FRANCE AND ONE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF 
HOUSTON. AFTER HOUSTON SHE WAS HIRED BY AIR LIQUIDE THE 
FRENCH INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL GAS MULTINATIONAL TO WORK ON 
REVERSIBLE OXYGEN BINDING. IN 1989, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTED HER 
TO VP RESEARCH. 
 
12. PRIOR TO JOINING CLONAID (SEE WWW.CLONAID.COM) IN 1997, 
DR. BOISSELIER HAD NOT WORKED IN BIOLOGY OR REPRODUCTION 
TECHNIQUES. THE LAS VEGAS-BASED CLONAID RECEIVED $500,000 
FROM MARK HUNT TO BUILD A LABORATORY IN WEST VIRGINIA BEFORE 
MR. HUNT DECIDED TO STOP FINANCING THAT PROJECT. CLONAID 
ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE RECEIVED $200,000 FROM 250 DIFFERENT 
DONORS IN THE HOPE OF CLONING A FAMILY MEMBER. ON MARCH 28, 
2001 DR. BOISSELIER AND RAEL DEFENDED THEIR CLONING PROJECTS 
BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE. 
 
13.  COMMENT. THE PUBLICITY GARNERED BY THE CLONING 
ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE USED BY THE RAEL ORGANIZATION TO GAIN 
NEW ADHERENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
14.  CANADA LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF 
ADOPTING LEGISLATION BILL C-113 WHICH WOULD BAN HUMAN 
CLONING. ONE LIKELY RESULT OF THE BOISSELIER ANNOUNCEMENT IS 
THAT SUCH LEGISLATION COULD CONTAIN STRICTER RESTRICTIONS. 
END COMMENT.

TAGS: SMIG, KPAO, SOCI, KISL, PGOV, PTER, PREL, PBTS, CA, Smuggling, Border Patrol 
SUBJECT: APPARENT ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM PRIMARILY PAKISTAN RESIDING 
IN THE UNITED STATES ENTER CANADA TO SEEK POLITICAL ASYLUM 
 
1. SUMMARY: SOME 200 ALIENS, MOST OF THEM OF PAKISTANI ORIGIN, 
FLOCKED TO THE NEW YORK-QUEBEC BORDER POST OF CHAMPLAIN-LACOLLE 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO FILE FOR THE STATUS OF POLITICAL REFUGEE AT THE 
CANADIAN BORDER IMMIGRATION OFFICE BEFORE THE START OF THE NEW 
YEAR.  PAKISTANI CLAIMANTS SAID THEY WERE NOW LIVING IN FEAR IN 
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF POST- SEPTEMBER 11 CONDITIONS. 
PAKISTANI CLAIMANTS SAID THEY WERE ALSO AFRAID THEY WOULD BE 
DEPORTED IF THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO THE INS BETWEEN MID- 
JANUARY AND MID-FEBRUARY. A TOP RANKING IMMIGRATION CANADA 
OFFICIAL TOLD POST CLAIMANTS WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED 
STATES DESPITE THE FACT THEY APPARENTLY HAD NO LEGAL U.S. 
IMMIGRATION STATUS.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  BETWEEN DEC. 27, 2002 AND JAN. 3, 2003, 150 PAKISTANIS AND A 
FEW DOZEN IMMIGRANTS FROM THE CONGO, LEBANON, PERU AND COLOMBIA 
TOOK BUSES TO PLATTSBURGH, NEW YORK AND THEN TAXIS TO THE LAST 
EXIT ON INTERSTATE 87 BEFORE WALKING THE LAST MILE INTO CANADA. 
THE LAST CLAIMANT ARRIVED ON JAN.3 AT 10 A.M. 
 
3.  AT NOON ON JAN. 3 ALL BUT THREE HAD BEEN PROCESSED (PICTURED, 
FINGERPRINTED AND THEIR CASE STORIES NOTED IN DEPOSITIONS WHICH 
TOOK BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE HOURS). TO PROCESS THE OVERLOAD, 
IMMIGRATION CANADA INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AGENTS FROM SIX TO 
SIXTEEN PER SHIFT. AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR, THE USUAL NUMBER OF 
REFUGEE APPLICANTS IS 6 PER DAY.  AN IMMIGRATION CANADA OFFICIAL 
STATED TO THE MEDIA THAT CLAIMANTS BELIEVED CANADIAN REGULATIONS 
WOULD CHANGE AS OF JAN. 1, 2003 AND THAT OTHERS THOUGHT \"SAFE 
THIRD COUNTRY\" REGULATIONS WOULD COME INTO EFFECT THIS JANUARY 
RATHER THAN LATER THIS SPRING. 
 
3.   APPLICANTS CLAIMED THEY HAD BEEN THREATENED AND HARASSED IN 
THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 ATTACK ON NEW YORK AND 
WASHINGTON. IMMIGRATION CANADA SOURCES ALSO TOLD POST THAT 
CLAIMANTS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR AT LEAST 
A YEAR AND SOME FOR AS MANY AS TEN YEARS.  IMMIGRATION CANADA 
TOLD POST THAT ALL CLAIMANTS WERE ILLEGALLY RESIDING IN THE 
UNITED STATES AND FEARED DEPORTATION. 
 
4.  CLAIMANTS WERE RELEASED BY CANADIAN AUTHORITIES AFTER THEY 
PROMISED THEY WOULD SHOW UP AT THEIR HEARINGS BEFORE THE 
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF REFUGEES. HEARINGS WILL START AS 
EARLY AS JANUARY 2003. THE MERIT OF EACH CASE WILL BE EXAMINED 
LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL REFUGEE CLAIM AND WILL NEED TO SATISFY 
GENEVA CONVENTION REQUIREMENTS.  THE LONG CANADIAN ASYLUM CLAIM 
EXAMINATION PROCESS CAN TAKE AS MUCH AS TWO YEARS, I.E. ENOUGH 
TIME FOR CLAIMANTS TO FIND A LOCAL SPOUSE, OR FOR THE EVOLUTION 
OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN TO CHANGE 
SO AS TO WARRANT FURTHER STUDY. 
 
5.   NO OTHER U.S.-QUEBEC BORDER POST HAS RECENTLY BEEN THE SCENE 
OF SUCH TRAFFIC. HOWEVER, SOME 200 SIMILAR APPLICANTS WERE 
RECENTLY PROCESSED BOTH AT THE WINDSOR AND THE FORT ERIE POSTS IN 
ONTARIO. IMMIGRATION CANADA SOURCES TOLD POST THAT BECAUSE THERE 
IS NO BIG CITY SOUTH OF THE QUEBEC BORDER THERE IS ALSO NO 
ORGANIZATION LIKE CASA VIVE WHICH HOUSES CLAIMANTS DURING THE 
DOCUMENTATION PROCESS AT THE BUFFALO-FORT ERIE POST. THIS 
EXPLAINS WHY CANADA WILL PROBABLY GO ON USING THE OLD TRAILER IT 
KEEPS IN ITS LACOLLE BACKYARD. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE ASYLUM CLAIMANTS 
WILL RETURN FOR THEIR HEARINGS OR WHETHER THEY WILL MELT INTO 
CANADIAN SOCIETY AS THEY APPARENTLY WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE UNITED 
STATES WITHOUT BEING DETECTED BY U.S. AUTHORITIES. 
 
7.  LOCAL MEDIA HAVE USED THE STORY OF YOUNG IRANIANS BEING 
JAILED IN CALIFORNIA AFTER SHOWING UP AS REQUESTED BY INS NOTICES 
TO CRITICIZE NEW U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS AND TO EMPHASIZE HARSH 
TREATMENT OF ETHNIC GROUPS IN POST SEPTEMBER 11 AMERICA. WITH THE 
ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO THE PAKISTANIS AT THE BORDER AND THE FBI 
SEEKING FIVE MEN ALLEGED TO HAVE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES 
THROUGH THE AKWASASNE NATIVE RESERVE THAT STRADDLES THE U.S.- 
CANADA BORDER, FURTHER CANADIAN MEDIA ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED 
ON THE FATE OF THE PAKISTANIS WHO DO SHOW UP AT INS OFFICES IN 
THE COMING MONTH. END OF COMMENT

SUBJECT: BORDER UPDATE - CANADIAN IMMIGRATION DIGS OUT OLD 
REGULATION FROM THE MOTHBALLS 
 
REF: SECSTATE MONTREAL 0004 
 
  1.   SUMMARY: A LONG-STANDING CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION 
CANADA (CIC) PRACTICE HAS CHANGED.  ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO PREVIOUSLY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY INTO CANADA ARE NOW TURNED 
OVER TO USINS UNTIL A CIC APPOINTMENT IS SCHEDULED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   STARTING IN LATE 2002, LARGE NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS -- 
FORTY A DAY NON-STOP FOR A MONTH AT THE LACOLLE/CHAMPLAIN (N.Y.) 
BORDER ALONE-- APPLIED FOR REFUGEE STATUS.  CIC WAS FORCED TO 
DOUBLE, SOMETIMES TRIPLE STAFF TO HANDLE THE LOAD OF INTERVIEWS. 
HOWEVER, ONE OF POST\'S CIC CONTACTS AT LACOLLE REPORTED THAT CIC 
HEADQUARTERS NOTIFIED BORDER AGENTS ON JANUARY 30, 2003, TO 
DIRECT THEM TO APPLY THE OLD BUT RARELY UTILIZED \"DIRECT BACK\" 
REGULATION TO BETTER CONTROL THE FLOW OF REFUGEE CLAIMS.  NOW, 
INSTEAD OF INTERVIEWING REFUGEE SEEKERS ON THE SPOT, CIC 
OFFICIALS GIVE REFUGEE SEEKERS AN APPOINTMENT FOR A LATER 
INTERVIEW AND, IN THE INTERIM, RETURN REFUGEE SEEKERS TO USINS. 
 
3.   THE RECENT PROCEDURAL CHANGE REPORTEDLY HAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED 
THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS WALKING UP TO THE BORDER, BUT A GOOD 
NUMBER STILL APPEAR DAILY.  FOR EXAMPLE, ON FEB 12, AT 07:45AM, 
EIGHTEEN PAKISTANI CITIZENS ASKED TO FILE FOR REFUGEE STATUS AT 
LACOLLE.  WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE GROUP WAS TURNED BACK TO 
USINS AND LATER DIRECTED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AT THE PLATTSBURGH 
SALVATION ARMY (SA).

SUBJECT: QUEBEC TELECOMS STRUGGLE WITH OVERCAPACITY, LACK OF 
CAPITAL 
 
REF: 02 OTTAWA 3290 
 
1. SUMMARY: QUEBEC\'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY, A SECTOR 
WHICH AT ITS PEAK IN 1999 SUPPORTED 114,500 JOBS, CUT MORE 
THAN 21,000 JOBS IN 2002.  ANALYSTS ARE PREDICTING ANOTHER 
ROUGH YEAR WITH LOW INVESTMENT RATES AND A POSSIBLE INCREASE 
IN BANKRUPTCIES IN SMALLER COMPANIES. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. MONTREAL-BASED BELL CANADA ENTERPRISES (BCE), CANADA\'S 
LARGEST AND OLDEST TELECOM, ANNOUNCED IN JULY 2002 A C$8 
BILLION WRITE DOWN ON ITS INVESTMENTS IN TELEGLOBE, THE 
INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE SERVICES COMPANY.  IN THE WAKE 
OF THE WRITE-DOWN, JEAN MONTY, WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE COMPANY 
FOR 28 YEARS AND CEO SINCE 1997, RESIGNED.  MONTY WAS 
REPLACED BY HIS OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR, MICHAEL SABIA, WHO HAVING 
BEEN A PROTEGE OF PAUL TELLIER AT CN, MOVED TO BCE, IN 1999 
AS PRESIDENT OF BELL CANADA INTERNATIONAL.  SABIA\'S FIRST 
MAJOR DECISION WAS TO SELL BCE\'S HIGHLY PROFITABLE PHONE 
DIRECTORIES BUSINESS TO A U.S. INTEREST FOR $C3 BILLION IN 
CASH IN ORDER TO REPURCHASE THE 20 PERCENT STAKE U.S.-BASED 
SBC INC. HELD IN BCE.  JOHN HENDERSON, TELECOM ANALYST AT 
SCOTIACAPITAL, SAYS \"SABIA GOT A GREAT DEAL, BUT I DON\'T 
THINK HE HAD TO SELL THE PHONE DIRECTORIES BUSINESS TO DO 
IT.\"  HENDERSON FEARS THAT THE SALE OF WHAT WAS SEEN AS A 
CASH COW MIGHT HURT BCE IN THE LONG-TERM.  BCE, WHICH HAD 
AGREED TO EITHER REPURCHASE THE SBC STAKE OR PERMIT SBC TO 
INCREASE ITS OWNERSHIP, OPTED TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE. 
 
3. MONTREAL-BASED MICROCELL TELECOMMUNICATIONS, OWNER OF THE 
FIDO MOBILE PHONE BRAND (THE SMALLEST OF CANADA\'S FOUR 
WIRELESS PHONE COMPANIES), FINALLY CAVED IN TO ITS CREDITORS 
AND DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AFTER MOUNTING LOSSES AND OVER C$2 
BILLION IN DEBT.  THROUGH A COURT ORDERED RESTRUCTURING 
PLAN, MICROCELL GAVE UP 68 PERCENT OF ITS EQUITY TO ITS 
CREDITORS IN RETURN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ITS C$2 BILLION 
DEBT LOAD.  THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN CALLS FOR MICROCELL TO 
DOUBLE ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND RETURN TO PROFITABILITY BY 
2005.  \"MICROCELL HAS A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD, THERE IS 
NO INDICATION THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO REBOUND FROM THE 
BANKRUPTCY THIS YEAR, LET ALONE IN 2005,\" SAID 
SCOTIACAPITAL\'S HENDERSON.  HE DOESN\'T BELIEVE THAT THE 
BANKERS NOW HOLDING THE LION\'S SHARE OF MICROCELL STOCK WILL 
HOLD THEIR EQUITY INTEREST FOR LONG. 
 
4. MICROCELL IS THE ONLY TELECOM COMPANY IN QUEBEC WHICH 
USES THE EUROPEAN-FORMAT GSM MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGY, A 
FORMAT THAT PERMITS USERS TO RETAIN THE SAME TELEPHONE 
NUMBER AND MOBILE PHONE NO MATTER WHERE THEY TRAVEL, SIMPLY 
BY CHANGING A CHIP WITHIN THE PHONE UNIT.  AS SUCH, ANALYSTS 
HAVE SUGGESTED MICROCELL MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE TAKEOVER TARGET 
FOR ONTARIO-BASED ROGERS/ATT WIRELESS, WHICH USES THE SAME 
GSM TECHNOLOGY.  HENDERSON BELIEVES THERE ARE GREAT 
SYNERGIES FOR ROGERS/ATT AND SUSPECTS A MOVE IN 2003. 
LAWRENCE SURTEES OF INTERNATIONAL DATA CORPORATION CANADA 
(IDCC), A LEADING INDUSTRY INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH COMPANY, 
DOES NOT CONCUR, ASKING \"WHY WOULD ROGERS PAY FOR SOMETHING 
THAT IS REDUNDANT.\"  SURTEES SAYS MICROCELL\'S BIGGEST 
PROBLEM IS LACK OF SERVICE COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF MAJOR AREAS, 
LEADING TO THE HIGHEST RATE OF CUSTOMER \"CHURN,\" (WHEN 
CUSTOMERS DROP ONE SERVICE FOR ANOTHER).  FARAJ NAKHLEH, 
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF 
CANADA (ITAC) BELIEVES, FIDO IS A GOOD DEAL AND WILL BE 
BOUGHT OUT THIS YEAR FOR UNDER $C1 BILLION.  \"[FIDO] HAS 
OVER ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS AND NO DEBT; WHO WOULD NOT WANT 
SUCH A PLUM,\" HE ASKED. 
 
5. ANOTHER QUEBEC-BASED PLAYER IS TELECOMMUNICATION 
EQUIPMENT MAKER SR TELECOM (SRT), A COMPANY WHOSE MARKET IS 
ALMOST ENTIRELY OVERSEAS.  SRT HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES FIXED WIRE PHONE LINE SERVICE WITH 
WIRELESS EQUIPMENT, ALLOWING REMOTE OR UNDERSERVED AREAS TO 
HAVE FULL TELECOMMUNICATION ACCESS.  FOUNDED IN 1981, SRT 
NOW EXPORTS ITS EQUIPMENT TO OVER 100 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DAVID ADAMS TOLD AMBASSADOR CELLUCCI 
DURING A RECENT VISIT TO THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS IN 
MONTREAL THAT SRT WANTS TO SELL ITS EQUIPMENT IN THE U.S. 
ACCORDING TO ADAMS, \"APPROXIMATELY SIX PERCENT OF THE U.S. 
DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LAND-LINE TELEPHONES; WE PLAN TO 
FILL THAT NICHE.\"  HOWEVER, SRT HAS NOT ESCAPED THE BURST OF 
THE TELECOM BUBBLE.  THE COMPANY HAD RECORD REVENUES IN 1999 
OF C$ 180 MILLION, BUT HAS POSTED TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARLY 
LOSSES SINCE, INCLUDING A 2001 LOSS OF C$13.7 MILLION.  SRT 
IS A SMALL PLAYER BY U.S. STANDARDS, BUT IT IS A WORLD 
LEADER IN ITS FIELD.  EMILIO IODICE, VICE PRESIDENT OF SRT, 
SAYS \"WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT, ONE THE U.S. WILL BE ABLE TO 
BENEFIT FROM AND ONE THAT WILL REDUCE THEIR DIGITAL DIVIDE.\" 
 
6. ONTARIO-BASED NORTEL NETWORKS, THE ONE-TIME DARLING OF 
THE STOCK MARKET AND ONE OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST TELEPHONE 
SWITCHING PROVIDERS, HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW OF C$0.67 A SHARE 
LAST OCTOBER.  NORTEL REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE IN CANADA BY 
OVER 8,000 EMPLOYEES IN 2002 AND SOLD OFF ITS ONCE-PROUD HI- 
TECH FACILITIES IN MONTREAL.  THE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 
REMAINING NORTEL EMPLOYEES IN QUEBEC ARE MAINLY SWITCHING 
SYSTEM ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS. 
 
7. JOHN HENDERSON OF SCOTIACAPITAL NOTES THAT A 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IS DISCUSSING INCREASING THE GOC\'S 
PRESENT LIMIT OF 20 PERCENT DIRECT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IN 
TELECOM COMPANIES TO 33.4 PERCENT (REFTEL).  HENDERSON 
BELIEVES THAT RELAXATION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT RULES WOULD 
BRING NEW CAPITAL TO THE INDUSTRY.  MICHAEL SABIA, CEO OF 
BCE, TOLD THE COMMITTEE (02/18/03) THE INCREASE IN FOREIGN 
OWNERSHIP WOULD ALLOW A \"GREATER FLOW\" OF CAPITAL.  WHILE 
HENDERSON DOES NOT THINK U.S. CAPITAL WOULD RUSH IN GIVEN 
INCREASED INVESTMENT CAPABILITY, HE BELIEVES COMPANIES SUCH 
AS FRANCE TELECOM AND DEUTSCHE TELECOM MIGHT BE TEMPTED. 
 
8. FARAJ NAKHLEH, VICE PRESIDENT OF ITAC, SEES 2003 AS A 
YEAR OF CONSOLIDATIONS, WITH A SLOW RETURN TO PROFITABILITY. 
HE AGREES WITH HENDERSON THAT A RELAXATION OF GOC FOREIGN 
OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS COULD HELP INTRODUCE NEW CAPITAL INTO 
THE QUEBEC TELECOMS.  THE DECISION, WHICH NAKHLEH TERMED 
\"LONG-OVERDUE,\" WOULD ALLOW EUROPEAN TELECOMS TO GAIN A 
FOOTHOLD IN NORTH AMERICA THROUGH ENTRY INTO THE CANADIAN 
MARKET. 
 
9. COMMENT: REVISIONS TO THE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS 
COULD BRING NEEDED CAPITAL TO THE QUEBEC TELECOM INDUSTRY, 
BUT IN THE SHORT-TERM, THIS SECTOR IS EXPECTED TO 
CONSOLIDATE RATHER THAN EXPAND.  AS SUCH, THE FIDO NETWORK 
STANDS OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET, EVEN BY A EUROPEAN TELECOM, 
GIVEN PARENT MICROCELL\'S DEBT-FREE STATUS FOLLOWING ITS 
BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION AND ITS USE OF EUROPEAN FORMAT 
MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGY. END COMMENT.

TAGS: KCRM, KFRD, KWMN, ELAB, SMIG, PREF, PHUM, Trafficking, Smuggling 
SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING VIOLATIONS: SEX AND SMUGGLING IN QUEBEC 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: MONTREAL, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS \"THE 
PARIS OF THE WEST,\" HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A REPUTATION IN THE 
SEX-TOURISM INDUSTRY AS \"THE BANGKOK OF THE WEST.\" NOT 
SURPRISINGLY, MOST TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IN QUEBEC PROVINCE 
INVOLVES WOMEN WHO ARE TRAFFICKED INTO THE SEX TRADE.  IN 
FEBRUARY 2003, MONTREAL POLICE BROKE UP A JUVENILE 
PROSTITUTION RING IN WHICH MINOR GIRLS WERE BEING FORCED TO 
ENGAGE IN NUDE DANCING AND PROSTITUTION. MONTREAL POLICE 
CONTACTS REPORT THAT AFTER THEY STARTED TO CRACK DOWN ON 
PROSTITUTION AND SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF MINORS, MANY RINGS 
MOVED BUSINESS OUT OF MONTREAL TO QUEBEC CITY AND NIAGARA 
FALLS. IN ADDITION TO TRAFFICKING FOR THE SEX TRADE, U.S. 
AND CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE SEEN INCREASED 
SMUGGLING IN PERSONS--SOME OF WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED 
TRAFFICKING--FROM COSTA RICA, MEXICO, CHINA, AND RUSSIA. 
LOCAL, PROVINCIAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE 
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN COMBATING ALL FORMS OF TRAFFICKING IN 
THE PROVINCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) THE QUEBEC-BASED SEX TRADE. \"LET YOUR FINGERS DO 
THE WALKING,\" BELL\'S YELLOW PAGES MOTTO HAS A DOUBLE 
ENTENDRE WHEN IT COMES TO THE 20 PAGES OF ADVERTISING FOR 
ESCORT AGENCIES IN THE 2003 PHONE BOOK.  THESE ADS, UP FROM 
17 PAGES IN 2002 AND 2 IN 1998, HIGHLIGHT WHAT A BIG 
BUSINESS THE SEX TRADE HAS BECOME IN QUEBEC. WHILE THE 
CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA PROHIBITS SOLICITING FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF PROSTITUTION, KEEPING A \"BAWDY HOUSE\" AND 
\"PROCURING AND LIVING OFF THE INCOME OF PROSTITUTION,\" 
ESCORT AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO MANEUVER AROUND REGULATIONS. 
ASIDE FROM ESCORT AGENCIES, QUEBEC IS KNOWN FOR NUMEROUS 
STRIP CLUBS WHERE, UNLIKE IN THE UNITED STATES, CLIENTS CAN 
TOUCH THE DANCERS. MANY TRACE THE GROWING SEX INDUSTRY IN 
QUEBEC TO A 1999 CANADIAN SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT 
LEGALIZED \"CONTACT DANCING,\" WHEREBY CUSTOMERS IN STRIP 
CLUBS ARE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE BREASTS, BUTTOCKS, AND THIGHS 
OF THE DANCERS. ACCORDING TO A 2002 ARTICLE IN THE GAZETTE, 
THESE LAP DANCES, OR PRIVATE CUBICLE ENCOUNTERS, SELL FOR 
AROUND $10 A PIECE AND BRING IN ABOUT 50% MORE REVENUES FOR 
CLUBS THAN THEY EARNED BEFORE THE 1999 LEGISLATION. 
 
3. (SBU) A PROFILE OF THE VICTIMS. WHILE MANY OF THE WOMEN 
WHO WORK FOR STRIP CLUBS AND ESCORT AGENCIES DO SO 
WILLINGLY, INVESTIGATIONS AND ARRESTS OVER THE PAST YEAR 
HAVE UNCOVERED HUNDREDS WHO ARE COERCED INTO THE BUSINESS. 
WHEN ASKED FOR A PROFILE OF THE GIRLS HE ENCOUNTERS, A 
MONTREAL POLICE INVESTIGATOR THAT POST INTERVIEWED DESCRIBED 
THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO.  VULNERABLE RUNAWAY GIRLS, MANY OF 
WHOM ARE MINORS, MEET MEN WHO OFFER THEM FOOD AND SHELTER. 
THEN, IT IS \"PAYBACK TIME.\"  THE MEN REQUEST THAT THE GIRLS 
BECOME DANCERS IN STRIP CLUBS. IF THE GIRLS PROTEST, THEY 
ARE TOLD THAT THEY OWE THE MEN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE 
INVESTMENT THEY HAVE MADE BY TAKING CARE OF THEM.  THE 
CARETAKERS THEN ACQUIRE FALSE IDENTITY CARDS FOR THE GIRLS 
TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE OVER 18 AND SET THEM UP IN BARS AND 
CLUBS THROUGHOUT QUEBEC AND IN NIAGARA FALLS. ONE GIRL 
REPORTED THAT SHE EARNED $300-$400 A DAY, BUT WAS ONLY GIVEN 
$25-$50 OF HER EARNINGS. THIS SCENARIO MATCHES THAT OF THE 
JUVENILE PROSTITUTION RING BROKEN UP BY MONTREAL POLICE IN 
FEBRUARY 2003.  THE GAZETTE REPORTED THAT THE TWO 
RINGLEADERS WOULD BEGIN BY DATING THE GIRLS AND BECOMING 
THEIR LOVERS, AND THEN FORCE THEM TO STRIP IN BARS IN 
MONTREAL AND TORONTO.  WHEN DANCING DID NOT GENERATE ENOUGH 
REVENUES, THE GIRLS WERE PUSHED INTO PROSTITUTION. 
 
4.  (SBU) POST\'S POLICE CONTACT REPORTED THAT MOST OF THE 
GIRLS HE ENCOUNTERS ARE CANADIAN. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO 
OTHER POST CONTACTS, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW CASES OVER THE 
PAST YEAR IN WHICH FOREIGN WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE TRAFFICKED 
TO QUEBEC FOR THE SEX TRADE. IN ONE CASE, TWO RUSSIAN WOMEN 
WERE BROUGHT TO CANADA FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF NUDE 
DANCING AND PROSTITUTION.  IN ANOTHER CASE, AN INDIAN WOMAN 
TRAFFICKED TWO MINORS INTO CANADA FOR PROSTITUTION. 
ACCORDING TO A CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL, THE WOMAN WAS 
APPREHENDED AND SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON BEFORE 
BEING DEPORTED TO INDIA. 
 
5.  (SBU) WHO ARE THE RINGLEADERS?  MOTORCYCLE GANGS ARE THE 
KINGPINS BEHIND PROSTITUTION, STRIP CLUBS, AND ESCORT 
AGENCIES IN QUEBEC.  ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE CANADA 2002 REPORT, THE HELLS ANGELS ARE THE LARGEST 
AND MOST CRIMINALLY ACTIVE OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANG IN CANADA 
WITH 35 FULL CHAPTERS. IN ORDER TO HAVE GIRLS PLACED IN 
CLUBS AND AGENCIES, OTHER HAITIAN, ASIAN, AND RUSSIAN GANG 
MEMBERS TEND TO USE THE MOTORCYCLE GANGS AS MIDDLEMEN. WITH 
INCREASED POLICE ATTENTION ON THE MONTREAL SCENE (WITHIN THE 
PAST SIX MONTHS, MONTREAL POLICE HAVE SET UP A TASK FORCE ON 
JUVENILE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION), THESE GANGS ARE EXPANDING 
INTO MARKETS IN QUEBEC CITY, OTTAWA, AND TORONTO. IN 2002- 
2003, POLICE HAVE SEEN A RAMPANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
GIRLS BEING SENT FROM QUEBEC TO WORK AS STRIPPERS AND 
PROSTITUTES IN NIAGARA FALLS. THE HANDLERS TAKE LARGE CUTS 
OF THE GIRLS\' EARNINGS, MAKING IT A VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS. 
IN QUEBEC CITY, THERE HAVE EVEN BEEN CONFIRMED CASES IN 
WHICH GIRLS HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM ONE HANDLER TO ANOTHER. 
 
6.   (SBU)  PROTECTION EFFORTS. ON JULY 28, 2002, CANADA 
AMENDED THE CRIMINAL CODE AND THE CANADA EVIDENCE ACT TO 
ENHANCE THE PROTECTION OF MINORS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION. THE LEGISLATION IS ONE STEP IN SATISFYING 
CANADA\'S COMMITMENT TO THE JANUARY 2002 UN PROTOCOL ON THE 
RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, THERE ARE 
SEVERAL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, FUNDED BY PRIVATE AND 
PUBLIC SOURCES, THAT OFFER PROTECTION TO YOUNG WOMEN 
INVOLVED IN THE SEX TRADE.  ONE ORGANIZATION IN MONTREAL, 
\"PASSAGES\" IS A SHELTER FOR 18- TO 30-YEAR OLD WOMEN. MANY 
OF THE WOMEN WHO COME TO THE SHELTER ARE INVOLVED IN DRUGS 
AND PROSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, A PASSAGES EMPLOYEE STATED THAT 
SHE RARELY SEES THE YOUNG WOMEN INVOLVED IN SEX TRAFFICKING 
RINGS; SHE SPECULATED THAT THE HANDLERS OF THESE WOMEN 
MONITOR THEIR ACTIVITIES CLOSELY AND PREVENT THEM FROM 
ACCESSING AVAILABLE SOCIAL SERVICES. IN THE OPINION OF 
POST\'S POLICE CONTACT, ONCE GIRLS ARE BROUGHT INTO A 
TRAFFICKING RING, THEY FACE A SLIPPERY SLOPE. VULNERABLE 
GIRLS, DRAWN TO OFFERS OF PROTECTION AND CARE, OFTEN THINK 
THEY ARE IN LOVE WITH THEIR \"PROTECTOR.\"  COERCED INTO NUDE 
DANCING, THEN PROSTITUTION, THE GIRLS QUICKLY BECOME PART OF 
A SEAMY WORLD IN WHICH DRUG USE AND ADDICTION IS PREVALENT. 
NEEDING INCOME TO SUPPORT THEIR DRUG HABITS, MANY GIRLS FIND 
IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO BREAK OUT OF THE SEX TRADE. 
 
7. (SBU) SMUGGLING. IN 2002-2003, U.S. AND CANADIAN 
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO SEEN CASES OF SMUGGLING TO 
AND THROUGH CANADA, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS 
\"TRAFFICKING.\" MEXICANS, COSTA RICANS, CHINESE, AND RUSSIANS 
HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ORGANIZERS. IN 2002-2003, NUMEROUS 
MEXICANS FILED CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE STATUS IN CANADA AFTER 
HAVING BEEN SMUGGLED ONTO FLIGHTS TO MONTREAL.  TO DATE, THE 
ORGANIZERS BEHIND THIS RING HAVE NOT BEEN APPREHENDED.  IN 
ANOTHER CONTINUING CASE, VARIOUS GROUPS OF COSTA RICANS HAVE 
BEEN TRAVELING TO CANADA ON FALSIFIED CANADIAN VISAS. AFTER 
ARRIVING IN CANADA, THEY PROCEED TO A SECLUDED PART OF THE 
U.S.-CANADA BORDER AND FLEE TO THE U.S. SIDE. THIS OPERATION 
HAD BECOME SO ORGANIZED THAT SOME OF THE GROUPS WERE MET AT 
THE AIRPORT BY TOUR BUSES WHICH DROVE THEM TO THE BORDER. 
WHILE THE ROYAL MOUNTED CANADIAN POLICE RECENTLY ARRESTED 
THE KINGPIN OF THIS OPERATION, INTELLIGENCE REPORTS WARN OF 
AN ONGOING BATTLE WITH COSTA RICAN SMUGGLING.  IN OTHER 
INSTANCES, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS APPREHENDED NUMEROUS 
CHINESE CITIZENS TRAVELING AS IMPOSTERS ON JAPANESE 
PASSPORTS. EACH PERSON REPORTEDLY PAID UP TO $30,000 FOR 
HIS/HER FAKE PASSPORT.  OFTEN TO GUARANTEE FULL PAYMENT, THE 
ORGANIZERS WOULD HOLD THE CUSTOMERS\' FAMILIES HOSTAGE IN 
CHINA OR SUBJECT THEM TO FORCED LABOR. FINALLY, A CASE THAT 
IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION INVOLVES A RUSSIAN DUO 
SUSPECTED OF SMUGGLING ALIENS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES FROM 
CANADA TO THE UNITED STATES BY HIDING THEM INSIDE A TRACTOR 
TRAILER TRUCK. THE DUO CHARGES EACH FOREIGN NATIONAL $3,000 
AND TRANSPORTS 3-10 PEOPLE TO THE UNITED STATES ON EACH 
TRIP.  IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THESE 
MEN.

TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, PREL, SMIG, SOCI, CA, Labor 
SUBJECT: Census Data Shows Quebec More Bilingual Since 1996, 
Mostly Due to Montreal Demographics 
 
 
This cable was jointly prepared by Montreal and Quebec City 
Consulates. 
 
1. SUMMARY: Statistics Canada (Statscan) has released 
several tranches of 2001 census data in the last four months 
regarding language usage and immigration, figures which are 
closely watched in Quebec, by both the media and government. 
The Statscan numbers show Quebec to be 3 percent more 
bilingual than in 1996, but provincial statistics suggest 
that bilingualism is mostly a Montreal area phenomenon.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2. Statscan\'s 2001 census data, reveals Montreal was home to 
12 percent of all new immigrants to Canada between 1991 and 
2001.  While Haiti was the top individual country of birth 
for immigrants to Montreal in the 1990s, accounting for 6.6 
percent or 14,200 of the immigrants arriving during the 
decade, Arab countries were the birth places of 29 percent 
of immigrants who settled in Montreal during the 10-year 
period. Algeria, Lebanon and Morocco were the top three 
countries of origin for immigrants to Montreal.  While 
Quebec as a whole admitted 37,498 immigrants in 2001, a 15 
percent increase over the previous year, according to the 
provincial Ministry of Citizen Relations and Immigration, 
the provincial capital only received 1,500. 
 
3.  The Statscan data also showed Quebec\'s population to be 
40.8 percent bilingual, 3 percent more bilingual than it was 
at the time of the 1996 national census, while French 
language usage in Montreal also inched up.  According to 
Statscan, the 2001 Census data showed that French language 
usage is rising on the island of Montreal, marking the first 
upturn after a 30-year downward spiral.  The proportion of 
Montrealers who speak French at home inched up to 56.4 per 
cent in 2001 from 55.6 percent in 1996.  In comparison the 
Anglophone population in Montreal decreased to 17.7 percent 
in 2001 from 18.9 percent in 1996. 
 
4. Jack Jedwab, executive-director of the Montreal-based 
Association for Canadian Studies, told us there are a number 
of reasons behind the shifts in language usage.  First, he 
believes young Anglophones are continuing to leave the 
province in search of job opportunities where bilingualism 
is not so necessary.  Secondly, more Anglophones are 
marrying into French-speaking families, and adopting French 
as the language used at home.  But most importantly, 
according to Jedwab, there has been a sharp increase in the 
Montreal allophone community\'s usage of French.  (Allophone 
is the term used in Canada to denote someone whose mother 
tongue is neither English nor French.) 
 
5. Statscan said that Allophones in Montreal increased to 
29.1 percent of the population from 27.7 percent in 1996, 
while both the French- and English-mother tongue populations 
decreased accordingly.  Among allophones, usage of French at 
home has increased almost four percent to 20.4 percent in 
2001 from 16.6 percent in 1996.  Meanwhile, the use of 
English at home by allophones dropped slightly from 24.1 
percent in 1996 to 22.1 percent in 2001.  These numbers 
reflect the fact that in Quebec, children whose parents are 
allophones are required to attend French language schools. 
 
6. Bilingualism is not nearly as widespread in the 
francophone heartland of Quebec, including the capital. 
Institut de la Statistique du Quebec (ISQ) data shows the 
level of bilingualism in Quebec City at only 5.6 percent; 
the provincial capital is 96.7 percent French speaking. 
According to 2001 ISQ figures, 44 percent of the population 
in Northern Quebec is francophone, 3.4 percent is 
anglophone, and 52.6 percent speaks another language, mainly 
Cree or Inuktitut.  With a population of less than 40,000, 
the northern Quebec region (covering three quarters of the 
province\'s land mass) remains first in Quebec in terms of 
the proportion of people whose mother tongue is neither 
French nor English.  Of all the regions, the Saguenay holds 
the highest percentage of population whose maternal language 
is French at 98.6 percent. 
 
7. In Quebec, 50.4 percent of Allophones are able to speak 
both national languages.  But Allophones also continue to 
use their mother tongues.  According to the 2001 census, 
Italian is still the most popular third language spoken in 
real terms, but Arabic saw the most growth.  During the five 
years between 1996 and 2001, the number of Arabic speakers 
increased by 29 percent.  And for the first time, Arab- 
speakers surpassed Spanish-speakers in their numbers in 
Montreal.  The Arab/West Asian minority in Quebec has now 
become the second largest minority after Blacks.  StatsCan 
counted 123,580 persons broadly-defined as Arabs living in 
Montreal in the 2001 census, up from 96,240 in 1996. 
However, the census permits respondents a wide range of 
choices, including \"Canadian,\" in identifying their origins; 
we have seen widely varying estimates on the actual numbers 
of Arab-origin Montrealers. 
 
8. The Quebec government continues to try to attract more 
immigrants and encourages them to establish outside the 
Greater Montreal area. The outgoing PQ Cabinet Minister 
Joseph Facal told us last year the province is trying to 
increase its annual intake of immigrants to 45,000 over the 
next 2-3 years.  Presently, the volume of immigrants living 
outside Montreal is only 15 percent but the aim is to 
increase that level to 25 percent.  Quebec targets 
francophones from North Africa, Europe and Asia; however, 
about half the immigrants who come to the capital are from 
Eastern Europe.  Jobs remain a problem but the Quebec 
authorities are trying to place \"visible minorities\" in 
government jobs, with a target of 33 percent for new hires 
in Montreal, 25 percent in Quebec City and 8 percent 
elsewhere in the province.  Currently placement is around 
3.4 percent of the province\'s 60,000 civil servants.  The 
further north, the less immigrants: Nunavik (Northern 
Quebec), comprising 55 percent of the entire Quebec 
territory, attracted the least number of newcomers in 2001- 
02 with only 2 immigrants, followed by the North Shore (8), 
and the Gaspe region (13). 
 
9. Quebec immigration recruitment policies do appear to have 
had a positive effect on the increase of French usage in 
Quebec.  The Census revealed that 49 percent of all new 
immigrants to Quebec speak French or English, compared to 
the Canadian average of 39 percent who speak either of the 
two official languages.  However, Alain Jean-Bart, former 
president of S.O.S.-Racisme (the Quebec chapter of the 
international anti-racism group), complained to us that the 
Quebec government selectively recruits Francophone 
immigrants (sidestepping would-be immigrants from West 
Africa, for example) while recruiting so-called 
\"francophonisable\" peoples in Latin American countries. 
S.O.S. Racisme has worked to counter stereotypical notions 
that Chinese and other immigrants are not francophonisable, 
i.e. not integrating into or contributing to the life of the 
province.  An official from the Ministry of Citizen 
Relations and Immigration recently confirmed that the GOQ 
has focused lately on recruiting immigrants from Argentina 
but he implied that the MRCI is merely exploiting the 
difficult economic situation there to bring skilled, 
educated workers to Quebec. 
 
10. Despite successes in Quebec\'s efforts to attract French 
speakers, Census 2001 revealed that Montreal remains third 
after Toronto and Vancouver in attracting new immigrants. 
Of the 1.8 million immigrants who arrived in Canada during 
the 1991-2001 period, only 12 percent settled in Montreal, 
while 56 percent went to Toronto and 20 percent settled in 
Vancouver.  Quebec continues to have difficulties in 
retaining new immigrants.  Statscan reported a net migration 
loss for Quebec of 57,000 people from 1996 to 2001, 
representing a net loss of 0.9 percent.  While these numbers 
may reflect migration that occurred following the 1995 
referendum on Quebec independence, the population decrease 
remains surprising given Quebec\'s economic resurgence of 
1999-2001. 
 
11. Quebec had the sixth highest rate among Canadian 
provinces of foreign born residents with 10 percent of its 
population in 2001 born outside Canada.  Quebec also has 
fewer visible minorities - only 7 percent of its population 
-- than the other high-population provinces.  Quebec Premier 
Bernard Landry, commenting on the Statistics data was quoted 
as saying, \"Quebec must have more immigrants, for obvious 
reasons.  The land is vast, our natural rate of growth is 
low.  So families, children, people are a priority for us, 
including those families and people coming from 
immigration.\" 
 
12. The Association for Canadian Studies\' Jedwab believes 
that for Quebec to both attract and keep immigrants, not 
only does the economy have to continue strong, but the GOQ 
needs to find more ways to involve immigrants in civil 
society institutions such as city council, school boards and 
the civil service.  \"Give these people [immigrants] a sense 
that they have a meaningful role in Quebec,\" he says. 
Minister Facal announced last month a plan to hold 
provincial government agencies more accountable for minority 
hiring.  Under the new proposal, Department heads will be 
required to publicize their hiring strategies and report the 
results at legislative hearings. 
 
13. Statistically, Quebec outperforms every other Canadian 
province on bilingualism, with the second closest being New 
Brunswick at 34.2 percent bilingual (the rest of the 
provinces all have bilingual populations less than the 
national average of 17.7 percent).  Quebec\'s rate of 
bilingualism at 41 percent is approaching the Western 
European rate of 47 percent.  As Jedwab points out, \"without 
the important numbers of bilingual persons in Quebec, the 
rest of Canada would rank in the lower end of the spectrum 
with the United Kingdom and the U.S.\" Ironically, 
bilingualism has been a federal, not a provincial goal.  The 
Chretien government\'s recent announcement of a C$751 million 
infusion into French language instruction throughout Canada 
was met mostly with indifference in Quebec. 
 
14. COMMENT: When you look at the political map of Quebec, 
it is the central Quebec, francophone areas that remain the 
most traditional and in the past, most tied to the Parti 
Quebecois.  Our contacts noted that, despite impending 
provincial elections, the release of the 2001 statistics on 
bilingualism did not create the same angst in the Quebec 
media and among politicians as in 1996, when the statistics 
came out a year after the 1995 referendum on independence. 
In fact, Landry has publicly acknowledged that it has become 
a rarity to see an anglophone less than age 50 who does not 
speak French.  While the province is not at the point of 
embracing bilingualism as a goal, even the Parti Quebecois 
realizes that for Quebec to sustain demographic and economic 
growth, the province needs new blood, and not just in 
Montreal.  END COMMENT

E.O. 12958: N/A

SUBJECT:  MONTREAL ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATORS COALITION OF 
LABOR AND ACTIVIST GROUPS; SIZE OF MARCH 16 
DEMONSTRATION QUESTIONED 
 
REF:  QUEBEC 00051 
 
1. SUMMARY:  Quebecers have traditionally been known for anti-war 
sentiment; in the lead-up to the current war in Iraq, polling 
data, media coverage and the largest demonstrations in Canada 
have indicated that pacifism is alive and well in the province. 
But the picture of Quebec pacifism presented in the last several 
months is probably more complicated than a simple outgrowth of a 
historical tradition.  Echec a la guerre, the coalition group 
that has organized all of the large anti-war demonstrations in 
Montreal since January, is comprised primarily of social action 
and labor groups.  Many of these same people and groups were 
active in protesting against globalization at the Quebec City 
Summit of the Americas in 2001.  Interestingly, evidence has come 
to light recently that the size of the Montreal demonstrations, 
which were reported to have drawn participants in the 100,000 to 
200,000 range, may have been considerably exaggerated.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2.  A Lger Marketing poll conducted March 19-23 is one of many 
highlighting Quebec\'s anti-war views. While Ontarians were 
equally divided as to whether or not the U.S. led coalition is 
justified in declaring war on Iraq (38 percent said yes, 39 
percent said no), in Quebec those numbers were 82 percent no and 
only 18 percent yes.  The same poll indicates that twice as many 
Quebecers (18 percent) would be inclined to boycott U.S. products 
than Canadians (9 percent). 
 
3.  Quebec journalists who in normal times hold views more 
compatible with anti-globalization and anti-U.S. groups have 
intensified their bias in the past year.  The France-U.S. 
disputes at the UN and the rise of anti-French sentiment in the 
U.S. has only deepened the anti-U.S. slant of the French media in 
Quebec.  Moreover, the presence of France in the dispute has 
increased the percentage of AFP stories and stories taken 
straight from French publications.  La Presse, arguably the most 
important paper in Quebec, dispatched correspondent Jooned Khan 
to Baghdad at the beginning of the war; Kahn is well known for 
his anti-American views and his reporting from Baghdad reflects 
this bias.  He has been regularly contributing first person 
accounts of casualties, especially civilian.  Most of the guests 
on \"Maisonneuve  l\'coute,\" one of the most watched news shows 
in Quebec, are solidly anti-U.S.  Last fall, Maisonneuve hosted a 
Moroccan-born professor, Omar Aktouf, who claimed on the air that 
Ben Laden had nothing to do with 9-11.  Aktouf\'s comments were 
unchallenged by Maisonneuve and the other guest, a French 
h 
philosophy philosopher Pascal Bruckner.  Maisonneuve and RDI, the 
all news network of the French CBC, continue to host French 
authors with strong anti-American views. 
 
4.  The large Montreal demonstrations against the war -- reported 
at 25,000 on January 18, 150,000 on February 15 and 200,000 on 
March 15 -- were organized by an umbrella group called chec  la 
Guerre (Defeat the War).  The Group receives the logistical 
support of the Fdration des Infirmires et Infirmiers du Qubec 
(FIIQ), the Federation of Quebec Nurses.  The FIIQ has a 
membership of 45,500.  (The chec  la Guerre web site is 
actually the FIIQ web site.)  Quebec unions tend to be more 
politicized than their more work place oriented counterparts in 
other Canadian provinces.  They typically have foreign policy 
positions, and their leaders speak out on behalf of international 
groups they see as oppressed (i.e. the Palestinians).  The Nurses 
union, for example, has provided assistance to Cuban 
o Cuban 
organizations and is financing other international projects. 
 
5.  The chec coalition, which assembled 125 groups for its first 
large march on February 15, has grown to over 200 in the past 6 
weeks.   Most of these groups have small, sometimes overlapping, 
memberships.  But the coalition also includes large, more well- 
known groups like the Federation of Quebec Women, Greenpeace, 
chapters of labor groups such as the Federation des Travailleurs 
du Quebec, and the Muslim Council of Montreal (itself an umbrella 
group of some thirty Montreal Muslim organizations.)  The 
official spokesperson of chec  la guerre is Francine Nmh, who 
is also Director of the Quebec Association of International 
Development Organisations, an umbrella group of 51 organizations 
that work in International Development such as Oxfam-Qubec and 
Mdecins du monde.  Nmh was a delegate at the Summit of the 
People at the Summit of the Americas.  In February, she said that 
aid that 
\"this war is illegal and immoral; to participate is to accept the 
premeditated murder of the Iraqi people.\" 
 
6.  Much has been made of the size of the demonstrations in 
Montreal.  The front page of the tabloid le Journal de Montral 
on March 16 screamed, \"Record Crowd for Peace: 200,000 People in 
the Street\" (superimposed over a picture of the crowds).  La 
Presse estimated the demonstration at between 100,000 and 200,000 
but said Montreal\'s showing provided \"a lesson of pacific 
solidarity to the rest of the world\" where demonstrations on 
March 16 attracted fewer people than a month earlier.  Several TV 
reports said Montreal had one of the largest demonstrations in 
the world.  The huge numbers of people who came out in cold 
weather to protest were quickly seized upon by organizers and 
commentators as indicative of the strength of the Quebec anti-war 
cause.  Bloc Qubcois leader Gilles Duceppe quoted the 250,000 
number in the House of Commons as proof of strong public anti-war 
ar 
sentiment.  Some said it could be argued that as many as 10 
percent of Montrealers were demonstrating (greater Montreal\'s 
population is approximately 2.5 million people). 
 
7.  However, on Sunday (4/6), Jean-Franois Grenier, President of 
GeoCom, a site locator company in Montreal, suggested to viewers 
of the French CBC 5 sur 5 show that the numbers of protestors on 
March 16 were not more than 49,000.  He indicated to post on the 
phone that 49,000 was a generous interpretation of aerial photos 
his company had taken of the crowds (leaving open the possibility 
that some thousands of people had left the protest when the 
photos were taken).  Grenier told us he thought the actual 
figure, as indicated by the density of the crowds measured in his 
photos, was likely between 35,000 and 40,000.  Geocom made a 
crowd density assessment for the demonstrations on March 14 at 
the request of French CBC.  Grenier indicated he thought the 
numbers cited by both the media, demonstration organizers and 
even the police were way off.  (Grenier also questioned the size 
of demonstrations reported in Europe.)  None of the Monday (4/5) 
papers mentioned the strong possibility that the March 16 crowds 
had been overestimated nor did CBC French television do much to 
publicize its new-found information. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  Regardless of the number of people who attended the 
peace marches, Quebecers do oppose the war to a greater extent 
than other Canadians. But because that opposition is greatest 
among the media and militant anti-globalization groups, 
perceptions may be skewed.  The present anti-war sentiment is 
widespread in Quebec but we suspect that among the general 
population, this sentiment does not run as deep as the media and 
certain politicians have presented it.

THE ICAO 5TH WORLDWIDE AIR TRANSPORT CONFERENCE, 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON 
LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT (MALIAT) 
MEMBER COUNTRIES MET TO DISCUSS WAYS TO INCREASE THE

AGREED TO BE DESIRABLE, AND THE U.S. COMMITTED TO PROVIDE TO 
THE PARTNER COUNTRIES TEXT OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE MALIAT 
THAT WOULD ALLOW SUCH ACCESSION. IN DISCUSSION OF

CURRENT PROSPECTS FEW 
--------------------- 
 
2. AT A MEETING HELD ON THE SIDELINES OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION\'S (ICAO) 5TH WORLDWIDE AIR 
TRANSPORT CONFERENCE IN MONTREAL, THE MEMBERS OF THE 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL 
AIR TRANSPORT (MALIAT) REVIEWED THEIR OUTREACH TO VARIOUS 
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR ACCESSION TO THE MALIAT.  SOME 
CANDIDATES - U.A.E., OMAN, SRI LANKA, THE COOK ISLANDS, AND 
TONGA WERE MENTIONED - BUT OF THIS GROUP, IT APPEARED THAT 
ONLY TONGA HAD EXPRESSED SERIOUS INTEREST. NOTE: IN A 
SEPARATE DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S. HEAD OF DELEGATION, THE 
CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE FROM TONGA, WHO WAS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ICAO MEETING, INDICATED THAT HIS COUNTRY WOULD BE 
TAKING A SERIOUS LOOK AT MALIAT MEMBERSHIP. END NOTE. 
 
3. AS THE GROUP BRAINSTORMED, CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO 
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  PERU AND CHILE, 
HOWEVER, NOTED THAT THEY HAVE FEW OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS IN 
THIS REGION AND THAT MOST CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS ARE 
AFRAID OF THEIR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH, PARTICULARLY CHILE. 
THEY ARE THEREFORE UNLIKELY TO GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO 
MALIAT ACCESSION. 
 
CARGO-ONLY PROSPECTS MORE PROMISING 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  THE LIST OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES GREW LONGER WHEN 
DISCUSSION OF A CARGO-ONLY ACCESSION WAS RAISED.  ALL 
MEMBERS SUPPORTED IN PRINCIPLE THE CONCEPT OF AMENDING THE 
MALIAT TO ALLOW SUCH ACCESSION, AND ALL EXPRESSED INTEREST 
IN REVIEWING AMENDMENT LANGUAGE PROMISED BY THE UNITED 
STATES.  THE U.S. EXPLAINED THAT THE USG INTERNALLY HAD BEEN 
WRESTLING WITH WHETHER TO INCLUDE BELLY CARGO IN THE 
AMENDMENT, AND HAD FINALLY DECIDED TO DO SO.  THERE WAS SOME 
DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THIS APPROACH, AND ALSO 
OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING CLEAR HOW A CARGO-ONLY MALIAT 
WOULD APPLY IN PARALLEL TO PASSENGER BILATERALS, BUT MOST 
WISHED TO RESERVE COMMENT UNTIL SEEING THE U.S. DRAFT. 
 
5.  THE CANDIDATES FOR FULL ACCESSION LISTED ABOVE WERE 
VIEWED AS MORE LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR A CARGO-ONLY ACCESSION. 
OTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATES INCLUDED PAKISTAN, WITH WHOM THE 
U.S. HAS OPEN SKIES, THAILAND, WHICH HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST 
IN ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL CARGO HUB, AND AUSTRALIA, WHICH 
HAS NO SIGNIFICANT CARGO CARRIERS OF ITS OWN AND WITH WHOM 
MOST MALIAT MEMBERS ALREADY HAVE CARGO OPEN SKIES.  IN 
ADDITION, CHILE AND PERU NOTED THAT THEY BOTH HAVE OPEN 
CARGO AGREEMENTS WITH ARGENTINA, AS DOES THE UNITED STATES. 
TAIWAN, DUE TO ITS UNIQUE POLITICAL STATUS, WAS ALSO 
MENTIONED AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE. 
 
6. IT WAS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT BEFORE A FINAL APPROVAL OF ANY 
CARGO-ONLY AMENDMENT, THAT AMENDMENT SHOULD BE SHARED WITH 
POTENTIAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT IT MIGHT BE ATTRACTIVE TO 
THEM.  SOME MEMBERS EXPRESSED A DISINCLINATION TO AMEND THE 
MALIAT WITHOUT THE HIGH PROBABILITY OF AN ACCESSION 
CANDIDATE. 
 
TRANSITIONAL AGREEMENTS 
----------------------- 
 
7. IT WAS GENERALLY AGREED THAT ANY TRANSITIONAL MEASURES 
SHOULD BE JUST THAT - LEADING ULTIMATELY TO FULL MEMBERSHIP 
- AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PERMANENT \"LEVELS\" OR 
\"CATEGORIES\" OF MEMBERSHIP WITHIN THE MALIAT (OTHER THAN THE 
CARGO-ONLY OPTION DISCUSSED ABOVE).  FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS 
LARGELY FELT THAT TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE ON AN 
AD HOC, BILATERAL BASIS WHERE THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS OF A 
POTENTIAL ENTRANT COULD BE ADDRESSED. 
 
PERU AND CHILE 
-------------- 
 
8.  THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF THE CURRENT THREAT BY PERU TO 
WITHDRAW FROM THE MALIAT.  BOTH DELEGATIONS WERE RELATIVELY 
SILENT DURING THE MEETING, ALTHOUGH CHILE\'S REMARKS ON THE 
UNDESIRABILITY OF TRANSITIONS SEEMED AIMED AT THEIR PERUVIAN 
COUNTERPARTS.  DURING THE CONFERENCE, U.S. DELEGATION 
MEMBERS SPOKE SEPARATELY WITH PERU AND CHILE ABOUT THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP IN THE MALIAT, AND BOTH EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT 
THE U.S. WOULD INVOLVE ITSELF IN HELPING THEM TO RESOLVE 
THEIR DIFFERENCES.  FOR ITS SIDE, CHILE WAS CONCERNED THAT 
ANY SEPARATE, TRANSITIONAL AGREEMENT WITH PERU BE OPEN TO 
THE SCRUTINY OF OTHER MALIAT MEMBERS, SO THAT PERU FEELS 
GREATER PRESSURE TO MAKE THE EVENTUAL TRANSITION TO FULL 
MEMBERSHIP.  PERU FOR ITS PART EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT 
WHETHER THE APPROVAL OF OTHER MALIAT MEMBERS WAS REQUIRED 
BEFORE ANY AD HOC BILATERAL AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE FORCE.  IN 
BOTH CASES, U.S. DELEGATION MEMBERS MADE CLEAR THAT, WHILE 
THE U.S. WAS HAPPY TO OFFER ASSISTANCE, ANY SOLUTION LIES 
WITH PERU AND CHILE TO RESOLVE BILATERALLY.

1. SUMMARY: Air Canada\'s recent filing for bankruptcy 
protection follows efforts over the past several months to 
restructure its operations and lower its costs in order to 
remain competitive during a difficult time in the airline 
industry.  However, a combination of its own business 
decisions, the rise of low-cost competitors, and several 
devastating events beyond its control helped bring the 
airline to this point. The bankruptcy protection will 
provide the airline time to develop a long-term strategy 
that might allow it to compete in a changed market.  The 
Canadian government has indicated a willingness to provide 
loan guarantees to Air Canada, but there are currently no 
plans for a cash bailout. END SUMMARY 
 
2. On April 1, 2003 Air Canada sought protection under the 
Companies\' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), Canada\'s 
equivalent to Chapter 11.  Even before the bankruptcy 
filing, Air Canada had declared a Force Majeur, citing the 
war in Iraq, in order to find relief from some contractual 
obligations and to justify the impending layoffs of 3,600 
workers, about 10 percent of its total workforce.  The Force 
Majeur declaration prompted a swift negative reaction from 
many of the airline\'s unions, which had already agreed to 
work with the company to save C$650 million annually in 
labor costs. 
 
3. During 2002 Air Canada lost C$428 million, most of that 
amount in the final quarter.  Since 1999, Air Canada has 
lost C$1.7 billion and is currently losing about C$3 million 
per day.  It has over C$13 billion of accumulated debt, 
approximately C$8 billion of which resulted from the 1999 
acquisition of Canadian Airlines (then its main rival), 
which was purchased primarily for its profitable Asian 
routes.  Air Canada\'s pension liability is also C$1.3 
billion.  It is the third major North American airline to 
seek protection from its creditors in the past 18 months, 
after United Airlines and USAIR. 
 
4. As recently as 2000, Air Canada carried about 80 percent 
of Canada\'s domestic passenger traffic.  The company\'s 
overwhelmingly dominant market share has led rivals to 
accuse it of predatory pricing.  Predatory or not, the 
airline\'s strategies have evidently not been successful: in 
the last 12 months, Air Canada has lost 12 percent of its 
domestic market share to its low-cost competitors, 
principally Calgary-based WestJet.  Cameron Doerksen, 
aerospace analyst for Dlouhy Merchant Group, a Montreal- 
based investment bank, told post \"they [Air Canada] simply 
cannot compete in the low-cost carrier market with a big 
airline budget,\" a view echoed by Michel LeBlanc, CEO of 
Montreal-based low-cost carrier Jetsgo. 
 
5. Over the past two years, Air Canada has tried to compete 
with its low-cost rivals by dividing its business into the 
main Air Canada brand and four new subsidiaries and brand 
names: Zip, Tango, Jazz and Jetz (REFTEL D).  Most operate 
on a lower wage/cost structure, but growth potential is 
limited by union contracts to a relatively small scale of 
operation, lest they cannibalize the main Air Canada 
operations and their higher-wage jobs.  Doerksen asserts 
that despite these efforts to compete in the low-cost 
market, where it might be difficult for a traditionally high- 
cost carrier ever to compete effectively, Air Canada will 
need to focus on its primary strength: long-haul 
international business travel. 
 
6. While Air Canada prepares a restructuring plan, expected 
in the middle of May, financial services company GE Capital 
has extended a C$1 billion line of credit to the airline. 
Air Canada CEO Robert Milton has also called on the Canadian 
government to provide loan guarantees during the 
restructuring, claiming it is impossible for Air Canada to 
compete with U.S.-based carriers that received a large 
financial package from the U.S. government following the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  Transport Minister 
David Collenette has previously indicated a willingness to 
consider loan guarantees, but no grants.  Meanwhile, the 
Parliamentary Committee on Airlines recently called for the 
federal government to assist all Canadian airlines by 
suspending airport rents and security fee collections for 
two years.  Both LeBlanc of Jetsgo and Clive Bedoe, CEO of 
WestJet, agree that all domestic airlines are vulnerable to 
current market conditions and believe that a national 
bailout should apply to all airlines, not just Air Canada. 
 
7. Air Canada returned to Ontario Superior court on April 
22.  In a hearing attended by attorneys from its labor 
unions and over 100 creditors seeking payment, Air Canada 
requested an extension of its restructuring window to June 
30, permission to delay its annual meeting until a 
restructuring plan is complete, and approval to renegotiate 
some of its labor agreements.  Air Canada had tentatively 
been permitted to suspend some of its contractual 
obligations when it made its CCAA filing on April 1.  Unlike 
U.S. Chapter 11, the CCAA has not historically permitted 
companies to void collective bargaining agreements.  On 
April 22, Ontario Justice James Farley rescinded some of the 
protections given Air Canada on April 1, but encouraged the 
airline and its unions to continue negotiations that would 
allow Air Canada to produce a viable restructuring plan. 
Both sides tried to interpret this outcome as a victory; the 
unions because Justice Farley denied Air Canada\'s request to 
bypass its agreements, and Air Canada because it may have 
obtained more flexibility in dealing with its unions than 
many companies have in the past.  Air Canada\'s decision to 
make its CCAA filing in Ontario is believed by some analysts 
to have been influenced by a recent Quebec court ruling in 
the case of Quebec mining company Jeffrey Mine, Inc., that 
collective agreements are protected during a restructuring 
period. 
 
8. In order to raise cash, Air Canada has in recent months 
attempted to sell some of its key holdings.  In February 
2003, it sold a 35 percent stake in Aeroplan, the airline\'s 
frequent flyer program, for C$245 million, and recently 
renegotiated an agreement with the Canadian International 
Bank of Commerce (CIBC) that will allow it to generate cash 
by selling frequent-flyer miles to retailers and insurance 
companies.  The Jazz subsidiary, a pan-Canadian domestic 
carrier, has been put up for sale, as has Air Canada 
Technical Services (ACTS).  ACTS may have a potential buyer 
in La Federation des travailleurs du Quebec (FTQ), which has 
2,500 members working at ACTS in Quebec.  Andre Viau, 
portfolio manager for aerospace with the FTQ pension fund 
management group, told post \"the deal is not yet clear. 
While we have a double interest in saving jobs and making 
some money, we might be looking to take on a small stake.\" 
Selling Jazz may prove more difficult; unlike some of the 
new subsidiaries, Jazz is burdened with older equipment and 
high labor costs, making it a relatively unattractive 
property in a slow airline market.  In addition, federal law 
restricting foreign ownership of Canadian airlines to 25 
percent limits the pool of potential buyers.  CEO Milton and 
other industry insiders have called on Transport Minister 
Collenette to amend this law, but he has stated that it 
would remain in place until the U.S. makes the same change. 
 
9. Air Canada\'s bankruptcy filing has caused short-term 
problems for others in the Canadian aviation system. 
NavCanada, the Crown Corporation that operates the country\'s 
air-traffic control system, is in financial jeopardy because 
Air Canada - its best customer - has failed to make its C$4 
million weekly payment since the CCAA filing.  Air Canada 
owes Aroports de Montreal C$11.5 million for unpaid rents 
and services rendered, and the Greater Toronto Airport 
Authority has seen its bond ratings lowered by Standard and 
Poor\'s in the wake of the Air Canada bankruptcy filing. 
Justice Farley has denied creditors\' statutory right to 
seize Air Canada\'s assets until after a restructuring plan 
is submitted. 
 
10. Air Canada is continuing regular operations during its 
restructuring, and the impact on travelers should be 
minimal.  However, in addition to lingering effects of the 
September 11 attacks and the war in Iraq, the recent 
outbreak of SARS is affecting Air Canada especially hard; 
their most profitable international routes are to Asia, 
while Toronto serves as its primary Canadian hub.  Even 
before the CDC and the World Health Organization issued 
travel advisories for Toronto, many people had been avoiding 
Toronto\'s Pearson Airport.  Taken together, Air Canada is 
experiencing a drop in passenger traffic at a time it can 
little afford it.  Air Canada several days ago mentioned 
that it might look to route some of its international 
flights to other airports - in particular Halifax and 
Montreal - but no such plan is yet in place. 
 
11. In the longer run, prospects may be more encouraging for 
both Air Canada and others.  Typically, an airline of Air 
Canada\'s size will emerge from bankruptcy protection between 
20-30 percent smaller, according to Doerkson.  Viau believes 
the new Air Canada will be smaller but stronger. \"With a 
smaller airline, they [Air Canada] will probably look to 
increase their outsourcing contracts, which will be good for 
the aerospace sector in Montreal,\" he told post.  Milton 
recently announced that a restructured Air Canada will have 
to shape itself along the lines of the new North American 
airline business model, with smaller planes and lower 
operating costs.  Air Canada has recently joined a 
consortium to purchase regional jets from Bombardier; Air 
Canada would initially acquire 25 of these jets to serve 
short-haul, moneymaking routes.  Air Canada recently named 
former Bombardier CEO Robert Brown to its board, which 
suggests that Bombardier is likely to remain Air Canada\'s 
principal aircraft supplier in this market, as opposed to 
its primary competitor, Brazil\'s Embraer. 
 
12. Comment: Air Canada\'s current predicament appears to be 
the result of both its own decisions in recent years and a 
number of unfortunate circumstances beyond the company\'s 
control.  Like many airlines, Air Canada has sought to lower 
its costs, either through changing union contracts or 
establishing new business models.  These measures have and 
will likely continue to generate resistance but are probably 
essential to Air Canada\'s long-term viability. End Comment.

SUBJECT: Varroa Parasite Infests Quebec Honeybee Hives 
 
1. SUMMARY: Quebec\'s honeybee population is under threat from a 
Varroa Mite parasite infestation that will likely reduce the 
province\'s modest honey production. Quebec beekeepers\' ability 
to combat the mite has been limited by delayed discovery of the 
parasite\'s resistance to the widely used pesticide Fluvalinate, 
and restricted access to the Coumaphos pesticide used in the 
U.S. and other Canadian provinces.  Though media reports 
suggested the Varroa infestation could have a negative impact 
on pollination of Quebec fruit orchards, local experts believe 
provincial harvests this year will remain stable.  However, if 
the bee population continues to decline, Quebec fruit producers 
will have to develop other cultivation methods.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Quebec\'s honeybee population is being ravaged by a tiny, 
bloodsucking parasite called the Varroa Mite, which destroys 
the bees\' reproductive cycle.  The mite has been in Canada for 
approximately 15 years, and about 8 years in Quebec, kept under 
control primarily by use of the pesticide Fluvalinate.  Last 
Fall, however, the Ministere de l\'Agriculture, des Pecheries et 
de l\'Alimentation du Quebec (MAPAQ), Quebec\'s Department of 
Agriculture, reported that the Varroa Mite had developed 
resistance to Fluvalinate, according to Dr. France Desjardins, 
a veterinarian and an expert in insect diseases with the MAPAQ. 
 
3. The province\'s beekeepers estimate that as a result of the 
mite\'s recently increased resistance to Fluvalinate, they have 
lost 40 to 60 percent of their bee populations this year. 
MAPAQ also says that the cold April weather killed off many 
already debilitated colonies. 
 
4. U.S. beekeepers have lived with the Varroa mite for over 20 
years, controlling it through the use of the pesticide 
Coumaphos.  Pesticide use is not yet fully harmonized between 
the U.S. and Canada, and use of Coumaphos is allowed only 
through a permit issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
(CFIA).  Several other Canadian provinces began to use 
Coumaphos last year when they discovered resistance problems 
with Fluvalinate, and have had favorable results.  MAPAQ 
applied for a permit on behalf of Quebec beekeepers after it 
discovered the mites\' resistance to Fluvalinate, and CFIA 
approved the application in March 2003. 
 
5.   According to Peter Keating, a Quebec-based commercial 
beekeeper and former inspector for MAPAQ, one reason for Quebec 
being later to detect the Fluvalinate resistance may be that 
MAPAQ does not employ a full-time bee expert.  Ontario, by 
comparison, employs a full-time expert and inspector and 
discovered the resistance problem in the summer of 2001, in 
time to devise new strategies against the mite. 
 
6.   According to Statistics Canada, Quebec ranks sixth among 
Canadian provinces in honey production (Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and Manitoba are the leading producers), accounting for about 
$3 million of the $70 million of honey produced in Canada each 
year.  A potentially more significant effect of a decline in 
Quebec\'s bee population would be on the province\'s agricultural 
industry, as many orchards rely heavily on the bees\' 
pollination process for fruit cultivation.  According to 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the estimated dollar value of 
honeybee pollination to Canadian agriculture was worth over 
$C18 billion in 2000, $C1 billion of that in Quebec.  Quebec- 
based apiarists generated about 6 percent of their revenues 
from the rental of their hives for pollination last year. 
 
7.   Laurent Pellerin, president of the Union des producteurs 
agricoles du Quebec (Quebec Union of Agricultural producers), 
believes the Quebec government should provide some financial 
assistance to beekeepers whose hives have been infested. 
However, Keating says that since there is no compulsory 
registration for beehives in Quebec, neither the MAPAQ nor any 
other government agency has a way of verifying compensation 
claims. 
 
8.   The decline in Quebec\'s honeybee population cannot be 
solved by importing replacement honeybees from the U.S.  The 
CFIA has prohibited live bee imports from the United States 
(with the exception of Hawaii) since 1987, believing that 
almost 100 percent of U.S. bee colonies are infested with 
Varroa mites.  In an assessment report issued in March 2003, 
the CFIA deemed importation of U.S. queen honeybees too high- 
risk to permit, because Fluvalinate-resistant Varroa mites are 
widespread in the United States and Coumaphos resistance is 
emerging.  The report determined that Coumaphos-resistant 
Varroa mites would become widespread throughout most honey- 
producing areas much more rapidly if Canada allowed importation 
of U.S. honeybees. 
 
9.   Former MAPAQ inspector Keating suspects some individual 
Quebec beekeepers are illegally importing U.S. queen bees, and 
believes that allowing importation of these bees would \"open a 
Pandora\'s box\" of infestation that could devastate the Quebec 
bee population, if mites resistant to Coumaphos were to breed 
with those resistant to Fluvalinate.  In the past ten years 
outbreaks of infestations have hit both Michigan and New York 
rather hard, but in both cases the industry was able to 
replenish itself, Keating claimed.  \"Quebec and Canadian 
beekeepers should learn from these experiences and develop 
defense strategies over the long-term.  Importation would be a 
short-term solution with damaging long-term prospects,\" he 
said. 
 
10.  Jollin Charest, agronomist for the MAPAQ, told post he 
does not believe the lack of bees will greatly affect the 
pollination process for fruit orchards this year.  Charest says 
apple orchards are struggling to find beehives, but says some 
are finding alternative methods, while others are not using 
them at all.  Charest estimates that only 20 percent of apple 
tree flowers need to be pollinated by honey bees in order to 
have a good crop year; other local insects, wind, wild bees or 
bumblebees can serve as alternative pollinators.  While it is 
still too early in the year to estimate whether lack of 
honeybees will have a big impact on the fruit harvest, Charest 
expects a relatively stable season with little loss.  Gerald 
Chouinard, of the Institute for Agro-Environment Research and 
Development, concurs with Charest regarding this year\'s harvest 
but says if the bee population continues to decline, Quebec 
fruit producers will have to develop other cultivation methods.

2. SUMMARY: The flagship of Quebec\'s aerospace industry, 
Bombardier Inc., identifies itself as the number three 
airplane maker after long-haul jet makers Boeing and Airbus. 
But the company is known in the aerospace business as the 
leading maker of corporate jets and regional jets (RJs), two 
plane sectors that Bombardier helped to develop and has 
dominated for the past decade.  The company is facing 
increased competition in the RJ market, in the midst of 
airline industry doldrums, and new CEO Paul Tellier\'s 
efforts to increase company profits and shareholder value. 
 
3. At the Paris Air Show in June, Tellier attempted to 
publicly downplay Bombardier\'s long-time rivalry with 
Brazilian regional jet maker Embraer noting that 
\"adversarial relations with your competitors are 
unnecessary\" and signaling that neither cut-throat 
discounting nor World Trade Organization proceedings are 
part of his plans to revive Bombardier\'s fortunes.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Bombardier Restructuring 
------------------------------- 
 
4. A C$24 billion transportation manufacturing conglomerate, 
Bombardier Inc. has been in a precarious financial position 
in recent years (REF A), with accumulated debt of C$14 
billion, falling profits and a declining stock price.  After 
restating its 2001 earnings to just C$36 million from the 
previously reported C$391 million, Bombardier declared a 
C$615 million loss for 2002 in April.  President and Chief 
Executive Paul Tellier (REF B) also announced layoffs of up 
to 3,000 employees and efforts to sell some operations, 
including its recreational products division and military 
services operations.  Bombardier announced the sale of the 
military division in June, for US$90 million, to L3 
Communications of New York.  The company expects to complete 
the sale of its recreational division this summer at which 
point Bombardier will consist primarily of two divisions, 
aerospace and transportation. 
 
5. Bombardier Transportation, which accounted for 40 percent 
or C$ 9.4 billion of Bombardier\'s total revenues for fiscal 
year 2002, is experiencing growth.  Most of the 
transportation division\'s employees -- 80 percent -- work in 
Europe, where the company says it held 50 percent of the 
market in FY 2002.  Despite last year\'s highly publicized 
problems with Acela trains delivered to Amtrak (REF A), 
Bombardier maintained a 28 percent share of the North 
American market in FY 2002.  The transportation group last 
year captured 21 percent of the total share of new orders 
worldwide, including a 352-car, C$941 million order from the 
Long Island Rail Road and a 100-car, C$378 million order 
from NJ Transit.  This week, Bombardier announced a 298-car, 
C$633 million order from Germany\'s Deutche-Bahn. 
 
6. Bombardier entered the aerospace industry only in 1986, 
with the purchase of Canadair.  That acquisition was 
followed by purchases of Short Brothers plc, of Belfast, 
Northern Ireland in 1989, Learjet of Wichita, Kansas in 1990 
and finally, de Havilland in Downsview, Ontario in 1992 - 
all primarily makers of small planes.  Bombardier\'s 
aerospace focus initially had been the corporate jet market. 
Corporate jets (also known as executive or business planes) 
are typically purchased for use by senior executives, high- 
level government officials or wealthy individuals; these 
planes seat from 5 to 40 passengers and have a range of 1500 
to 6000 miles.  Deliveries of Bombardier corporate jets, 
which peaked in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001 at 
203 jets, have sharply dropped off since then; Bombardier 
delivered 162 business aircraft in FY 2002 and the company 
delivered only 77 corporate jets in FY 2003.  Not 
surprisingly, would-be U.S. buyers of these planes see them 
as luxury purchases, easily postponed during economic 
downturns. 
 
------------- 
Regional Jets 
------------- 
 
7. Though Bombardier unveiled three new business plane 
models at the Paris Air Show in June, the company is clearly 
focused on the Regional jet market.  Regional jets (RJs) are 
defined as small-body commercial aircraft having 50 to 100- 
passenger seats and an average 2000-mile range.  In recent 
years, airlines have been increasing their use of RJs, as an 
alternative to wide-body jets.  Some airlines have been able 
to develop new passenger markets by offering service to 
smaller cities through the use of these RJs, which are more 
fuel-efficient and cost-effective than wide-body planes. 
Right now, the regional jet is the only growth sector in the 
commercial airplane manufacturing industry, according to 
Chuck Evans, Director, Airline Industry Analysis and 
Strategy Marketing, at Bombardier Aerospace.  Indeed, in 
notes for his June 10 annual meeting speech, Tellier wrote, 
\"This aircraft [the RJ] is the cornerstone of the airline 
industry restructuring.  The aircraft meets the airlines\' 
needs.  There are more regional jets flying now than before 
September 1, 2001.\" 
 
8. In 2002, Bombardier\'s CRJ line of planes accounted for 54 
percent of the total world RJ market and 44 percent of 
Bombardier\'s total airplane production (56 percent of the 
company\'s production was corporate jets).  The planes in 
Bombardier\'s CRJ series can seat between 50 and 85 people 
and have a 2000-mile range.  Atlanta-based Delta Connection 
is the largest operator of CRJ\'s with over 273 in operation. 
According to Evans, a major advantage of the CRJ line is 
reduced pilot training time; all models use the same cockpit 
configuration, making it possible for pilots to learn how to 
fly a different CRJ model in just four days, instead of the 
standard 30 days of training required to fly a new airplane 
model.

9. The biggest challenges to growth in the North American 
regional jet market have been airline pilots\' collective 
agreements and airplane purchase financing for cash-strapped 
airlines.  Union \"scope\" clauses, which protect higher pay 
scales for pilots who fly long-haul jets, have limited 
carriers\' ability to use RJs.  But U.S. pilot unions have 
recently made large concessions on airlines\' use of RJs, 
making these planes much more financially attractive.  The 
financing of airplane purchases, however, through vendor 
discounting, government loans and loan guarantees, and 
private financing, continues to contribute to the overall 
shaky picture of the aerospace industry.  Airlines most in 
need of the RJs for restructuring purposes need financing to 
purchase the more efficient planes.  Both Bombardier and its 
Brazilian competitor Embraer are rumored to have heavily 
\"discounted\" the purchase price of their planes in a US$4.3 
billion 170-jet order from US Airways.  The order, announced 
in May, was split between the two plane manufacturers. 
 
10. The Export Development Bank of Canada (EDC), in its 2003 
report, noted its large loan exposure (33 percent) to the 
aerospace industry (C$9.3 billion).  Atlantic Coast Airlines 
and AMR Corp (American Airlines), both Bombardier clients, 
account for 10 percent of the EDC exposure, and both 
companies are reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy.  Evans 
said that airlines continue to get purchase financing, but 
was unwilling to say whether the financing for Bombardier 
purchases was primarily offered by the vendor or from 
private or government sources.  The Montreal Gazette 
reported (7/5) that Britain\'s Export Credits Guarantees 
Department plans to provide export credits for two loans 
amounting to more than US$200 million, allowing two Delta 
Air Lines subsidiaries to purchase Bombardier RJs 
(Bombardier\'s Shorts plant in Northern Ireland qualifies the 
company as a British exporter).  The Gazette pointed out 
that Investissement Quebec, the provincial export promotion 
vehicle, has also extended considerable loan guarantees to 
Bombardier customers. 
 
11. Analysts believe the present plane financing situation 
is unhealthy for both the aerospace and airline industries; 
however, clearly it is more in Bombardier\'s interest for 
governments to provide airplane financing than for the 
company to engage in discounting and financing deals on its 
own balance sheet.  Tellier has made a concerted effort to 
pay down Bombardier\'s debt since January 2002, halving the 
company\'s dividend and raising C$854 million in an April 
sale of stock. 
 
-------------------- 
Rivalry with Embraer 
-------------------- 
 
12. Bombardier\'s chief competitor in the RJ market, Embraer, 
has begun offering the Embraer 190, an RJ which seats 100 
passengers.  While the 190 has not yet flown in commercial 
operation, New York-based JetBlue Airlines recently 
purchased 100 of these planes.  \"The sale of the 100-seaters 
[Embraer] to JetBlue, has made us [Bombardier] think of re- 
opening up development for BRJx,\" says Chuck Evans. 
Bombardier had been developing the BRJx as its own 100-seat 
RJ but shelved the project last year because of the downturn 
in the U.S. airline market.  In Paris, Tellier confirmed 
that Bombardier may relook at the BRJ-X program once the 
company\'s economic problems are resolved.  Europe\'s Airbus 
A318 and Boeing\'s B717, while marketed as regional jets, 
have many wide-body characteristics and costs, and have not 
yet acquired a major share of the RJ market.   Boeing 
recently announced sale of 10 B717s to Airtran.  Reportedly, 
Air Canada is looking at the Boeing 717s, among other RJs, 
to revamp its fleet following its bankruptcy reorganization, 
but most analysts think Bombardier, as a Canadian company, 
would have an advantage over other manufacturers.  Air 
Canada already operates 26 Bombardier RJs. 
 
13. Embraer and Bombardier\'s bitter rivalry has led to at 
least five disputes at the World Trade Organization and 
rulings against both the Canadian and Brazilian governments 
for illegal subsidies to the companies.  At this year\'s 
Paris Air Show, however, Tellier made headlines by paying a 
courtesy call on Embraer CEO Mauricio Botelho.  Tellier 
later told the press \"adversarial relations with your 
competitors are unnecessary.\"  He also made it known that 
for the first time in more than six years, neither company 
is interested in a new WTO complaint against the other.  The 
WTO activity in this case concluded in December 2002 when 
the WTO authorized Brazil to take trade countermeasures 
against Canadian goods to the value of C$328 million. 
Previously, in December 2000, the WTO authorized Canada to 
take C$1.2 billion worth of countermeasures against 
Brazilian products.  Neither Canada nor Brazil is expected 
to impose the countermeasures, however, representatives of 
the two governments continue to meet to discuss how they 
might repair the damage to the bilateral relationship caused 
by the dispute. 
 
14. Comment:  Tellier has made some difficult decisions in 
his first six months as CEO at Bombardier.  While the 
aerospace division has been criticized for not recognizing 
the potential market for larger, 100-seat RJs, Tellier 
appears willing to sacrifice market share in order to get 
Bombardier\'s profit margins up, and increase shareholder 
value.  While no one believes that Bombardier will give up 
its fierce competition with Embraer, in seeking to lower the 
profile of that competition, Tellier is signaling investors 
that neither cut-throat discounting nor World Trade 
Organization proceedings are part of his plans to revive 
Bombardier\'s fortunes.

SUBJECT: YOUTH GROUP VISITS CONSULATE ON PLIGHT OF AFRO- 
COLOMBIANS 
 
 
1.  Summary.  Two leaders of Black Youth in Action (BYIA), a 
Montreal NGO, paid a visit to the Consul General (CG) on 
Monday, July 21.   The purpose of the visit was to deliver a 
letter describing the displacement of the Afro-Colombian 
population in Colombia and to request the names of African- 
American civil rights leaders to whom BYIA could lobby for 
the protection of the Afro-Colombians.  The CG provided a 
suggested list of organizations to BYIA on July 25.  End 
summary. 
 
2.   BYIA, also known as Jeunesse Noire En Action (JNEA), 
was founded in 1999.  It is a political and civic 
organization composed of Black youth with family, 
organizational and interest ties to Africa, the Caribbean, 
North America and Latin America.  BYIA is \"dedicated to 
integrating Black youth in the social and political life of 
Quebec Province and Canada.\"  The BYIA membership age range 
is from 13 to 30.  The group has been successful recently in 
getting its views heard around Montreal and other parts of 
Quebec Province. 
 
3.  BYIA Founder and Political Coordinator Peter Flegel and 
BYIA member Karl Didier informed the Consul General about 
the organization\'s numerous initiatives in the past year. 
The group expressed concern to Montreal Mayor Tremblay about 
\"racist\" remarks made by Municipal Councillor Jeremy Searle 
in a borough council meeting; launched a letter-writing 
campaign to complain to the Editor-in-Chief of Quebec City\'s 
major paper, Le Soleil, about a cartoon depiction of two 
Black Francophones; launched a campaign in Montreal high 
schools to combat violence; participated in the United 
Nations Working Group on People of African Descent; engaged 
municipal, provincial and federal government leaders about 
the unemployment rate of Black university graduates; and 
mobilized the Black youth vote in the 2003 provincial 
election campaign.  As a result of its efforts in the 2003 
provincial campaign, BYIA has gained the attention of 
Premier Jean Charest. 
 
4.  The primary purpose of the July 21 visit was to discuss 
what BYIA reports as \"ethnic cleansing\" of the Afro- 
Colombian population by the Colombian paramilitary forces. 
The BYIA representatives specifically noted a May 2, 2002 
bombing that resulted in the death of 119 Afro-Colombians 
and the serious injury of 98.  BYIA concluded that one of 
the main causes for attacks on the Afro-Colombian community 
is a link between the amended constitution that provided 
Afro-Colombians with collective land ownership rights in 
Choco Province and vested interests of Colombian and 
multinational companies in the petroleum, uranium and gold 
found in the area.  BYIA also noted that the Government of 
Colombia seeks to build a canal linking the Caribbean Sea 
with the Pacific Ocean through land owned by Afro- 
Colombians. 
 
5.  BYIA reports that Colombian organizations have warned 
that further attacks on the Afro-Colombian population are 
imminent. BYIA said that it has voiced its concerns to the 
Government of Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT), urging DFAIT to \"pressure the 
Government of Colombia to protect the Afro-Colombians from 
paramilitary forces, to guarantee Afro-Colombian land 
ownership after the civil war has ended, and to implement 
social programs to assist the displaced Afro-Colombian 
population.\"  BYIA also has urged the Government of Canada 
to implement a moratorium on all deportations to Colombia. 
 
6. The two BYIA leaders closed their meeting with the CG by 
requesting assistance in establishing contact with major 
African American civil rights leaders, so that BYIA could 
\"inform them about the plight of Afro-Colombians and 
encourage them to pressure the U.S. Government to protect 
people of African descent in Colombia.\" 
 
7.  The CG faxed Political Coordinator Flegel on July 25, a 
list and contact information for the following organizations 
with human rights advocacy and/or interest in issues related 
to the African diaspora: The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, The Congress of Racial 
Equality, The King Center, The Rainbow Coalition/Operation 
Push, The Carter Center and The Office of the Congressional 
Black Caucus.

SUBJECT: Phased Expansion Plans for Montreal\'s Dorval Airport 
 
REF: A) MONTREAL 0412 (2002) 
 
1. This cable contains input from Embassy Ottawa. 
 
2. SUMMARY: Montreal\'s Dorval International Airport recently 
opened Phase 1 of a planned three-stage, C$700 million 
expansion that will include new and improved facilities as well 
as integration of the airport into the local and regional 
transportation network.  The renovation is part of an overall 
effort to have Dorval reestablish itself as a major 
international hub.  Plans for Phase 3, which may not begin 
until 2006 or 2007, include new pre-clearance facilities for 
Department of Homeland Security inspectors; however, it is 
unclear whether these new facilities will address long-standing 
DHS pre-clearance security concerns. END SUMMARY 
 
3. Aeroports de Montreal(ADM), a non-profit agency, manages 
both Dorval and Mirabel Airports under a 60-year lease signed 
in 1992 with Transport Canada, the federal transportation 
agency.  Mirabel is located approximately 30 miles from 
downtown Montreal in a relatively unpopulated area; it was 
developed in the 1970s with the intention of replacing Dorval, 
which was considered to have low growth potential because it is 
surrounded by residential neighborhoods.  However, Mirabel\'s 
distance from the city made its viability dependent on train 
and highway connections from downtown Montreal that were never 
developed.  Consequently, Mirabel never gained sufficient 
support either from the airlines or the traveling public and 
many international carriers abandoned Montreal for Toronto. 
 
4. In 1996, ADM determined that, with expansion, Dorval would 
be able to accommodate all passenger traffic for the 
foreseeable future.  It allowed international carriers to move 
back to Dorval in 1997.  Some charter carrers continue to 
operate at Mirabel but all will have moved to Dorval by 2004. 
In an interview with post, CEO James Cherry said ADM is 
obligated under its lease to maintain an airport at Mirabel, 
and will devote it to cargo transport for now.  Cherry said ADM 
plans this fall to issue a formal Request for Proposals to 
determine a future use for Mirabel\'s underused terminal 
facilities.  Mirabel has understandably been dubbed a \"White 
Elephant\" by many, but the 75,000 acre site will remain 
available should need for a second major passenger airport 
ultimately arise. 
 
5. Rating agency Standard and Poor\'s recently downgraded ADM 
from an A plus to an A, citing difficulties in the airline 
industry, and in Dorval\'s case, the long wait for a new lease 
with Transport Canada.  According to Cherry, \"they [S and P] 
were just looking for excuses; they are downgrading all 
Canadian airports.\"  Cherry says that over eighty percent of 
all travelers who fly through Dorval either start or finish 
their trip at Dorval.  This high percentage of 
origin/destination traffic insulates Dorval from the 
instability found at many hub airports; the steady passenger 
stream from area residents provides ADM with a consistent 
income flow.  \"Even during slow periods, Montrealers will still 
have the need to fly,\" he explained. 
 
------------------------- 
Three Phases of Expansion 
------------------------- 
 
6. The Dorval renovation and expansion are projected to cost 
approximately C$700 million and will occur in three phases. 
Phase I, the Trans-border Jetty, which handles flights between 
the U.S. and Canada, opened on April 1, 2003.  Although several 
gates can accommodate planes as large as a Boeing 767, the new 
jetty is designed with adjustable bridges to accommodate even 
the smallest aircraft, such as regional jets.  Cherry said that 
Dorval\'s expansion was designed with current airline 
restructuring trends in mind; he predicted that low-cost 
airlines may ultimately claim up to 40 percent of the Canadian 
domestic air travel market. 
 
7. The Trans-border jetty offers some significant improvements 
over the previous 1950s era terminal: more gates, more shopping 
and eating areas as well as greatly enhanced security with the 
complete segregation of arriving and departing passengers. 
Cherry noted that while the new facility is spacious and 
modern, it is not the \"architectural monument\" that some recent 
airports have become.  Originally the Dorval expansion was set 
to cost C$1.3 billion, but the plans were scaled back after 
Cherry was hired in 2001. 
 
8. Phase 2 of Dorval\'s expansion plan is a new International 
Jetty, scheduled to open in 2005 and currently about 25 percent 
completed.  It will include a new arrivals hall, a new Canadian 
immigration/customs inspection facility and a baggage claim 
area that will handle both international and U.S. arrivals. 
The International Jetty will have at least one gate able to 
accommodate the new super-jumbo Airbus A380 and will also 
feature several \"swing\" gates allowing a plane to arrive as a 
trans-border or international flight and depart either to the 
U.S. or another international destination. 
 
9. Phase 3 will include check-in areas for US-bound flights, a 
new US Customs/Immigration pre-clearance area, an enlarged 
domestic jetty for small aircraft, and a rail station that will 
connect to VIA Rail\'s intercity service, as well as to the 
Central Station downtown.  Since a train station already exists 
one mile from the airport terminal, linking the airport to the 
Ottawa-downtown Montreal corridor should be relatively 
inexpensive, according to CEO Cherry.  He estimated the cost at 
approximately C$90 million.  Construction work would also 
improve highway access to Dorval.  Phase 3 is expected to begin 
in 2006 or 2007, and should take about two years to complete, 
although financing has not yet been arranged and the ADM board 
has not given its final approval.  CEO Cherry told post \"we 
[ADM] are considering moving up the start date [of phase 3] by 
one year, maybe in 2005.\" 
 
10. Notwithstanding the fact that the Transborder Jetty was 
built and is operational, renovations at Dorval and Mirabel are 
currently hindered by what Cherry describes as \"perverse 
economic consequences\" of the lease signed with the federal 
government in 1992.  Under that lease, while ADM is responsible 
for financing all improvements, the federal government receives 
up to 80 percent of any income resulting from investments in 
new facilities.  According to Cherry, ADM went ahead with the 
renovations based on personal assurances from the Federal 
Minister of Transportation that a new lease formula for most of 
Canada\'s major airports will remove such disincentives and make 
it possible to undertake new business partnerships. 
 
--------------------------- 
Increasing Passenger Levels 
--------------------------- 
 
11. The Dorval expansion is expected to increase the airport\'s 
capacity from its present level of 9 million passengers each 
year to 15 million; ADM bases its expansion plans on projected 
average annual growth of 3-4 percent.  According to Christiane 
Beaulieu, ADM Vice President for Public Affairs, Dorval\'s 
current three runways handle 55-60 movements (takeoffs or 
landings) per hour, and could handle up to 100 per hour, so 
expansion will be limited to terminal facilities.  Beaulieu 
said ADM\'s marketing department is working to bring in new 
airlines and get others to expand their operations.  Lufthansa 
and Austrian Airlines recently re-established service at 
Dorval, and Canadian discount carriers Westjet and Jetsgo have 
been increasing their level of service.  Air Canada, despite 
its bankruptcy problems, is also planning to expand at Dorval, 
in part because of the airport\'s lower operating costs. 
Because Dorval is not a major hub, it experiences much less 
peak-period congestion than hub airports like Toronto and 
consequently, offers airlines considerable potential for fuel 
and labor savings through reduced delays. 
 
----------------------- 
Immigration and Customs 
----------------------- 
 
12. According to Normand Boivin, VP of Dorval operations, ADM 
is working with US and Canadian immigration on a new clearance 
system that, once the International Jetty is completed, will 
allow passengers to disembark from an international flight and 
move directly to the U.S. inspection area.  This should 
increase Dorval\'s viability as a hub for international flights 
terminating in the U.S. 
 
13. A longstanding concern of Department of Homeland Security 
personnel at Dorval has been the security of the pre-clearance 
inspection area: customs and immigration inspectors currently 
are interviewing and pre-clearing passengers who have had 
neither their persons nor their luggage screened.  After the 
9/11 attacks, the security screening stations (x-ray and metal 
detectors) were temporarily moved in front of the 
immigration/customs area, but have since been moved back.  A 
long-term solution will require more expensive renovations that 
are unlikely before the new facility is built in Phase 3. 
ADM\'s plans to address the security concerns are not clear, 
however.  Henri-Paul Martel, ADM\'s Vice President for 
Engineering and Construction, showed post preliminary designs 
for the new inspection area featuring the same configuration as 
the current facility.  However, in his interview with post, 
ADM\'s CEO Cherry himself raised the DHS pre-inspection security 
concerns, saying that these concerns will factor into the 
design of the new inspection facility planned for Phase 3. 
According to him, the inspection areas will be located behind, 
rather than in front of, security screening stations.  However, 
Phase 3 construction wouldn\'t be completed until 2007, if 
construction began in 2005. 
 
14. COMMENT: The ill-fated effort to develop Mirabel into 
Montreal\'s airport of the future resulted in a serious decline 
in the city\'s status as an air transportation center.  The 
current effort to expand Dorval and bring it up to modern 
standards -- despite airline industry doldrums -- confirms its 
status as Montreal\'s principal passenger airport for at least 
the next 30 years.  However, competition might arise from an 
unexpected quarter.  Not far across the border in Plattsburgh, 
New York, a former U.S. military air base is being converted 
into a commercial airport that Plattsburgh city leaders plan to 
market as a gateway to Montreal in a few years.  END COMMENT

1. SUMMARY: The World Ant-Doping Agency (WADA) is 
experiencing financial problems because member countries, 
including the United States, are behind on paying dues, 
according to WADA President Richard Pound.  The agency 
collected 80 percent of its U.S.$20 million budget in 2002 
and thus far, has received only 63 percent of dues owed in 
2003.  WADA\'s executive committee met on September 23, and 
considered imposition of sanctions on countries that are in 
arrears to the anti-doping agency, including barring 
national anthems and flags at international sporting events 
of late-paying or non-paying countries. END SUMMARY 
 
2. At WADA President Richard Pound\'s invitation, Consul 
General Bernadette Allen (accompanied by FSN economic 
assistant Zbily as notetaker) visited WADA\'s Montreal 
headquarters (9/16) and received a briefing on the Agency\'s

Montreal lawyer and former Olympic swimmer, was the runner- 
up in the 2001 election of the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) presidency, losing out to Belgian Jacques 
Rogge.  He was instrumental in the campaign to have WADA 
headquartered in Montreal, where it is now situated in very 
luxurious office space in the city\'s stock exchange tower. 
The new office space was funded by the Canadian, Quebec and 
Montreal governments.  WADA\'s activities include random 
testing of athletes, establishment of doping control 
standards, and research and development of anti-doping 
tests. 
 
3.  Pound informed the CG that the preparation of testing 
facilities and staff for the 2004 Athens Games will be 
conducted on a \"low-budget\" basis, due to the problems WADA 
has been having in collecting member country dues in a 
timely fashion.  The IOC covered WADA\'s budget for its first 
two years of operation, with the understanding that member 
countries would pick up half of WADA\'s budget after the 
agency was up and running.  Beginning in 2002, the IOC has 
been responsible for matching, on a 50-50 basis, funds 
collected from member nations.  In 2002, WADA collected 80 
percent of member country dues; so far in 2003, WADA has 
only received 63 percent of money owed from member 
countries.  This year, the IOC has advanced WADA so-called 
\"operational\" funds until it can collect payments from 
member countries. 
 
4. WADA member countries, acting through the International 
Inter-Governmental Consultative Group on Anti-Doping in 
Sport (IICGADS), are divided into five regions: the 
Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania.  The Americas 
share is set at 29 percent of the total or almost $2.5 
million, with the U.S. and Canada committed to paying 9.41 
percent each.  However, other countries in the region have 
failed to pick up the remaining 10.18 percent of the 
\"Americas\" allocated share.  According to WADA\'s website, in 
2002 Canada paid $800,000, the U.S. $794,800 and other 
Americas countries only $16,663. 
 
5.  Pound complained that WADA\'s coffers have been 
negatively affected by the U.S. budget cycle.  Pound noted 
that the U.S. payment has been significantly delayed not 
only because the U.S. government fiscal year doesn\'t match 
WADA\'s calendar year budget, but also because the USG has 
for months at a time operated on a continuing resolution 
(CR).  That said, Pound acknowledged that he is confident of 
eventually receiving the U.S. share.  Other countries have 
simply not paid, Italy being the most notable in that 
category.  Pound suggested that it would be helpful if the 
U.S. dues (of approximately US$ 1 million a year), could be 
paid a year in advance to avoid the \"out of sync\" budget 
cycle problem and the CR issue. 
 
6. WADA held an executive committee meeting on September 23 
(reported in the press and on WADA\'s website).  Committee 
members reportedly discussed possible measures to sanction 
late-paying/non-paying countries including removing members 
from Exec. Committee or Board membership, if their country 
has not paid dues.  In a Quebec television interview, Pound 
went so far as to suggest that countries in arrears to WADA 
could be prevented from displaying national flags, or having 
anthems sung, at Olympic and other international events. 
Such sanctions, according to Pound, \"would have a far 
reaching effect.\" 
 
7. At WADA headquarters, CG Allen was also introduced to Dr. 
Olivier Rabin, the organization\'s Science Director.  Rabin 
bemoaned WADA\'s US$5 million budget for research and 
development, which he characterized as \"way too small\" to 
significantly develop new testing methods. Rabin stated that 
the newest trend in doping is the use of \"growth hormones.\" 
While there are no testing mechanisms in place to detect 
these hormones, Dr. Rabin said WADA is working on developing 
a test to distinguish between synthetic hormones and those 
naturally produced by athletes. 
8. Both Rune Andersen, Director of Standards and 
Harmonization, and Dr. Rabin saw the run-up to the Beijing 
games in 2008 as potentially challenging for anti-doping 
testing.  The WADA executives shared with the CG an article 
(dated 9/14) from the Daily Telegraph newspaper of London 
that reported on the high priority China is placing on 
producing world-class athletes.  The article states that in 
addition to setting up schools and training centers for an 
estimated 260,000 athletes, the Chinese Government has been 
developing scientific strategies to identify athletic 
potential and create optimum training methods.  The WADA 
executives expressed concern that the organization\'s limited 
budgets will make it increasingly difficult to test athletes 
in a meaningful way.  WADA conducted 4,500 tests on athletes 
in 2002 and plans a modest increase in testing in 2003.

SUBJECT:  CHAREST GOVERNMENT, QUEBEC LABOR UNIONS 
HEADED FOR SHOWDOWN 
 
REF:  QUEBEC 0210 (2002) 
 
1. Summary:  Premier Charest\'s Liberal government and 
Quebec\'s powerful unions are headed for a showdown over 
proposed revisions to provincial labor laws on 
subcontracting and the health care system.  Both sides 
are playing for public support, though neither 
particularly successfully so far.  Unions have already 
mounted demonstrations, work stoppages and acts of 
vandalism; a province-wide Day of Disruption is 
scheduled for December 11.  The Liberals are trying to 
push four labor-related legislative actions through the 
National Assembly before Christmas.  At stake is 
whether organized labor in the province will be able to 
maintain its traditional and unique strength in the 
face of the government\'s desire to make Quebec more 
competitive with other Canadian provinces and more 
attractive to investors. Charest told CG Quebec that he 
is determined to stand up to the unions and will not 
bend under intimidation tactics. End Summary. 
 
Quebec\'s Unions 
2. In 2002, Quebec for the third straight year was the 
most highly unionized state or province in North 
America with 40.7 percent of its workers collectivized 
as compared to 32 percent in Canada and 28 percent in 
Ontario and 15 percent in the U.S.  Public sector 
workers make up a large majority -- 82 percent -- of 
Quebec\'s 1,260,000 unionized workers.  The rate of 
unionized workers in the province\'s private sector is 
27.7 percent. 
 
3. According to Julie Cusson, a researcher at the 
Conseil du Patronat (the province\'s top business 
group), when the Quebec Labor Code was first designed 
in 1964 its main goal was not to establish the rules of 
engagement between labor and employers but to 
facilitate unionization and put Quebec labor at the 
forefront of the battle for workers\' rights. According 
to Cusson, Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada or 
the U.S. where workers wishing to form a union do not 
have to vote.  Union representatives only have to 
collect the signatures of 50 percent of a work unit\'s 
employees plus one in order to secure union 
accreditation.  In other provinces, a required secret 
vote takes place a week or two after union membership 
cards have been signed. 
 
4. The largest union in the province is the Federation 
des Travailleurs du Quebec (FTQ) with 520,000 members 
or 42.5 percent of Quebec\'s unionized workers, 
including most of the construction workers.  The 
Confederation des Syndicates Nationaux (CSN), known for 
its extremism, accounts for 20.8 percent of Quebec 
union members, the Centrale des Syndicats du Quebec 
(CSQ) or teachers\' union has 9.2 percent, and the 
Centrale des Syndicats democratiques, 3.9 percent.  A 
few independent unions, such as the independent nurses\' 
union, the Federation des Infirmieres et Infirmiers du 
Quebec (FIIQ) (the main organizer of the marches 
against the war in Iraq last spring), as well as some 
independent government workers unions make up 23.1 
percent of the total work force. 
 
Proposed Changes 
5. One of the most controversial items in Premier Jean 
Charest\'s so-called \"re-engineering plan\" for the 
province is his government\'s proposal to amend Article 
45 of the Quebec Labor Code.  Article 45 has come to be 
interpreted in such a way that employer subcontracting 
has been all but prohibitive in the province.  Under 
Article 45, courts have said that workers are entitled 
to keep their benefits and wages, when their work is 
subcontracted to another employer.  Guy Lemay a 
Montreal labor lawyer believes the proposed Bill 31 
revision of Article 45 would give Quebec businesses and 
governments the same sub-contracting flexibility 
available to companies in the other Canadian provinces. 
However, Opposition leader Bernard Landry echoed the 
labor line at National Assembly hearings on the bill, 
saying that the proposed revisions to Article 45 would 
transform $20 per hour jobs into $10 per hour jobs. 
 
6. In the health care sector, the government has put 
forward two organizational measures with potentially 
deep labor impact.  Bill 25 would merge local clinics 
and long-term care centers under the authority of 
general hospitals with a single board of directors; 
regional health boards would be eliminated throughout 
the province.  Bill 30 would limit to five the number 
of categories of workers in a hospital, thus reducing 
the number of bargaining units in Quebec\'s health 
system from 3,671 to 1,961.  At present, in some Quebec 
hospitals, directors must negotiate with more than 
twenty bargaining units from janitors to x-ray 
technicians. 
 
7. One other key Liberal piece of legislation, Bill 32, 
would raise the cost of government run-day care centers 
from $5 to $7 next fall.  Although daycare is only 
indirectly a labor issue, labor officials are using it 
to attract support from the general public in their 
plan for a province-wide \"Day of Disruption\" on 
December 11.  Government workers in schools, hospitals, 
daycare centers, public transportation and other public 
agencies are being called upon to demonstrate against 
the government on that day in their workplaces. 
 
8. Union leaders have said that labor activism will 
increase after the Holiday season if the Charest 
government does not change course.  Charest told CG 
Quebec December 3 that he would not give in to union 
intimidation tactics - inter alia, demonstrators had 
trashed the offices of Minister Benoit Pelletier and of 
President of the National Assembly Michel Bissonet that 
week.  He said he was determined to proceed with 
Article 45 amendment and union consolidation on certain 
fronts.  According to several post contacts and news 
reports, Spring could mark the start of a series of 
major work stoppages and general strikes.  Many public 
sector union contracts ended last summer and are 
currently in the negotiation process.  By Spring, 
thousands of government workers will have been without 
a collective agreement for more than six months; if 
negotiations continue fruitless, strikes threats will 
become a reality. 
 
9. According to a member of the FTQ policy bureau, 
labor groups fear that if the Charest government is 
successful on subcontracting and health system 
organization issues, it may be tempted to challenge 
other Quebec labor conditions that have not yet been 
debated publicly.  For instance, successive Ontario 
premiers have petitioned their Quebec counterparts to 
open Quebec construction sites to Ontario workers.  And 
Quebec employers have long said a secret ballot should 
be held before union accreditation is granted. 
 
Union Rhetoric and Action 
10.  Unions have criticized Charest for planning the 
upcoming reform behind closed doors, and for moving too 
quickly, without enough stakeholder consultation.  The 
CSN insists the government\'s plans were drawn up in 
\"secrecy\" or with the help of the Conseil du Patronat. 
Post\'s FTQ contact complained Premier Charest has never 
consulted FTQ President Henri Mass on provincial 
reengineering.  An October 14 open letter by Charest, 
published in the province\'s major papers, particularly 
stung in its accusation that labor leaders were only 
concerned with protecting their \"corporatist\" 
interests.  Quebec business leaders, who have been 
supportive of Charest\'s proposed changes, point to a 
late November CROP survey that showed Quebecers were in 
favor of privatizing or subcontracting government 
services so as to reduce the size of the state. Labor 
meanwhile emphasizes that the same survey showed 
satisfaction with the Liberal government has dropped 
from 51 percent in September to 43 percent in November. 
 
11.  The union actions of the past few months have not 
been very conclusive.  Montreal public transit workers 
were criticized by the media and commuting public for 
going on a one-week strike in mid-November even though 
full service was provided during extended rush hours. 
Even Labor\'s friends in the press and its allies in the 
Parti Quebecois have condemned union acts of vandalism 
and prevention of public events.  Among other staged 
events, Union activists 1) overtook and vandalized a 
children\'s hospital to prevent Premier Charest from 
making an announcement there; 2) vandalized the offices 
of several Members of the National Assembly; 3) broke 
furniture in a downtown Montreal hotel and prevented 
the Conseil du Patronat President from attending a 
conference; 4) beat up a TV crew; 5) spread liquid hog 
manure on the carpet of one city councilor\'s apartment 
building. 
 
12. Not all of Quebec\'s unions rely on such strong-arm 
strategies, but the use of intimidation by Quebec 
unions  -- and near acquiescence to it by authorities - 
-  has been a feature of the labor scene here for many 
years.  In September, Montreal municipal workers used 
city vehicles to block traffic and bridges during rush 
hour while their new contract was being negotiated. The 
only repercussions were that the workers will have to 
pay for the gas used and will be docked pay for the 
hours they spent immobilizing thousands of Montrealers. 
Reportedly, criminal charges are almost never brought, 
though unions have caused thousands of dollars in 
property damage as well as human injury. 
 
13.  COMMENT: Since the early 60s, strong labor unions 
have been a characteristic of Quebec\'s \"distinct 
society.\"  The Liberal\'s attempt to reduce labor costs 
and privileges in the province will be the first and 
biggest test of the mandate for change Charest claimed 
in winning the election last April. End comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SNAR, KCRM, PHUM 
SUBJECT:  QUEBEC GOVERNMENT CRITICISED FOR HANDLING OF 
DISPUTE AT KANESATAKE RESERVE 
 
 
1.SUMMARY: The Quebec government of Premier Jean 
Charest is facing scrutiny and criticism for its 
handling of recent factional disputes at the Kanesatake 
Mohawk reserve though a violent clash was averted (at 
least temporarily).  After the home of Kanesatake Grand 
Chief James Gabriel was burnt to the ground, and some 
60 native police officers were held prisoner in the 
Reserve\'s police station for 30 hours, a group of 
dissident Mohawks accepted a compromise brokered by 
Quebec\'s Minister of Public Security Jacques Chagnon. 
Gabriel, a reformer who has decried the presence of 
organized crime and drug trafficking on the reserve, 
told the media he was betrayed by the Quebec 
government, which he said had earlier pledged support. 
Kanesatake (population 1400) is located 50 kilometers 
northwest of Montreal, near the municipality of Oka, 
the site in 1990 of a 78-day standoff between armed 
Mohawk Warriors and police forces including Canadian 
Forces.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. The burning of Mohawk Grand Chief James Gabriel\'s 
house and the blockade of the Kanesatake police station 
were apparently sparked by Gabriel\'s decision to fire 
the Reserve\'s police chief and hire some 60 law 
enforcement officers from 19 native but non-Mohawk 
tribes.  According to press reports, Gabriel\'s decision 
followed a leak that foiled a scheduled RCMP raid.  On 
January 7, a communique signed by three dissident 
chiefs warned Kanesatake residents that the RCMP would 
be coming onto the reserve on January 11.  The 
communique also accused Chief Gabriel of wanting to 
shut down the many tobacco shacks on the reserve where 
\"duty free\" cigarettes are sold. 
 
3. At a Montreal press conference 1/13, Gabriel denied 
he wanted to eradicate the shacks, which have 
mushroomed from a handful to about thirty in less than 
a year, noting that in the 1990s when the tobacco trade 
was threatened band members turned to dealing in drugs. 
Gabriel and Terry Isaac, whom Gabriel had hired to lead 
the newly created force, said that their goal was to 
battle organized crime, which they claim has a very 
strong presence on the reserve. 
 
4. Gabriel had the support of three other Chiefs on the 
seven-member Kanesatake Band Council.  However, three 
dissident chiefs have tried various means, including a 
recent referendum, to have Grand Chief Gabriel 
recalled.  On the basis of his slim majority in the 
Council, Gabriel was taking steps to reform the 
reserve\'s police force, which was under the control of 
a Police Commission dominated by dissidents.  Gabriel 
also said he had received promises of protection and 
help from the Quebec Ministry of Public Security. 
However, with his house burning, and the newly arrived 
police officers held hostage at the Kanesatake police 
headquarters by masked, armed men, Gabriel was forced 
to flee the reserve with his wife and four young 
children.  Minister of Public Security Chagnon 
negotiated a settlement of the stand-off with the 
police commission and reinstated the police chief that 
Gabriel had fired. 
 
5. Premier Charest and Public Security Minister Chagnon 
defended the province\'s actions, saying that their 
first objective was to avoid bloodshed and a prolonged 
standoff.  Charest and Chagnon both raised the specter 
of the 1990 Oka crisis, which resulted in the death of 
one policeman, a situation they didn\'t want to see 
repeated.  Answering critics who suggested the Quebec 
government was caving in to criminal elements, Chagnon 
displayed some irritation with Gabriel for acting too 
hastily and for not sufficiently consulting all 
stakeholders before bringing in the outside native 
police officers.  Chagnon implied that Gabriel\'s 
evidence of organized crime operations on the reserve 
was insufficient. And Chagnon also criticized Gabriel 
for not mentioning to him in a November 8 meeting that 
he was about to get $900,000 from Canada\'s Solicitor 
General to help fight organized crime at Kanesatake. 
 
6. Georges Beauchemin, Secretary-general of Quebec\'s 
Public Security Ministry (and a key figure in resolving 
the Oka crisis), told Quebec City Consul General Keogh- 
Fisher that the situation in Kanesatake had been very 
dangerous, \"with both sides armed and ready to shoot.\" 
However, he said that outside intervention by Quebec 
provincial police would have been seen as an invasion 
and \"pushed good guys on the side of bad guys.\" 
According to Beauchemin, Grand Chief Gabriel was lucky 
to have escaped with his life.  He told the CG that the 
progressive elements (\"the good guys\") are less 
organized than the criminal elements.  Somewhat 
wishfully, Beauchemin suggested that the Mohawks need a 
more structured, efficient police organization which 
could produce evidence that will stand up in court in 
order that criminals in Kanesatake could be prosecuted. 
Beauchemin believes that such a court process would 
send a message to other Mohawk communities with similar 
problems. 
 
7.  On 1/15, Quebec\'s top first nations chiefs gave a 
press conference throwing their support to Gabriel. 
Grand Chief Ghislain Picard, who is Regional Chief of 
the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador 
said the first nations chiefs were concerned by Quebec 
government actions, noting that Quebec had chosen to 
negotiate with a minority rather than with the duly 
elected majority.  The Chiefs also announced that they 
would be setting up a special fund to collect money in 
order to build a new home for Gabriel.  Picard added 
that organized crime is a problem many reserves have to 
confront; he said Quebec had sent the wrong signal to 
all the First Nations by disavowing a Grand Chief who 
was working to fight organized crime.  He added that 
the Grand Chiefs will be less inclined to take part in 
future coalition force operations, given Quebec\'s 
handling of the Kanesatake situation.  The chiefs at 
the press conference stressed the current situation is 
very different from the Oka crisis of 1990, which was 
set off by Mohawk concerns that a community neighboring 
the Kanesatake reserve intended to expand its golf 
course into a Mohawk ancestral burial ground. 
 
8.  Recent newspaper articles report that marijuana 
cultivation in Kanesatake is netting various 
individuals millions of dollars annually, because of 
the blind eyes of native police and the reluctance of 
RCMP and Surete du Quebec to enter Mohawk reserves. 
According to these reports, the cultivation is spread 
out between several hydroponic installations and 
outdoor fields. The hydroponic greenhouses produce five 
or six harvests a year and are difficult to detect 
because they are heated with gas-powered generators 
(thereby avoiding incriminating heavy electricity 
consumption). 
 
9.  Comment:  Cynics have suggested that Premier 
Charest was anxious to avert a major crisis before his 
trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum next week. 
(He may have been reminded that the 1990 Oka stand-off 
received considerable negative publicity in Europe, 
where there is strong public sympathy and fascination 
for the culture and plight of North American native 
populations.) While the Charest government\'s 
intervention may have precluded a violent clash this 
week, the possibility remains that confrontations have 
only been deferred.  End comment. 
 
10.  The Consulate in Quebec City contributed to this 
report.

AIRPORT (AKA DORVAL) AT APPROXIMATELY 5:45PM (1745 HOURS) ON 
THURSDAY (FEBRUARY 12) GROUNDED ALL OUTBOUND AIR TRAFFIC TO 
THE UNITED STATES FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS.  SEVERAL PLANES IN 
FLIGHT WERE RECALLED TO DORVAL FOR RESTERILIZING.  THE 
RESCREENING OF PASSENGERS AND BAGGAGE REVEALED NOTHING, 
PERMITTING THE RESUMPTION OF OUTBOUND FLIGHTS AROUND 8:00PM 
(2000 HOURS).  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. PER REF TELCON, A PASSENGER (WHO WAS IN MONTREAL FOR ONE 
OF POST\'S SPEAKER\'S PROGRAMS) CONTACTED POST\'S PRINCIPAL 
OFFICER (PO) AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00PM (1800 HOURS) TO REPORT 
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SECURITY BREACH AT DORVAL AIRPORT. 
CONSEQUENTLY, SHE REPORT THAT HER OUTBOUND PLANE WAS IN A 
HOLDING PATTERN ON THE TARMAC AND THAT OUTBOUND TRAFFIC WAS 
GROUNDED FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD. 
 
3. PO CONTACTED DHS INSPECTORS AT THE U.S. PRE-FLIGHT 
FACILITY TO CONFIRM THE REPORT AND LEARNED A BAGGAGE CHECKER 
AT DORVAL HAD REPORTED THAT A MALE PASSENGER\'S CARRY-ON 
BAGGAGE (A LAPTOP COMPUTER) HAD YIELD POSITIVE RESULTS FOR 
EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL.  THE BAGGAGE CHECKER REPORTEDLY ASKED 
THE MALE PASSENGER TO WAIT SO THAT THE LAPTOP COULD BE 
RESTESTED, BUT SOMEHOW LOST SIGHT OF THE PASSENGER AND THE 
LAPTOP AT APPROXIMATELY 5:45PM.  ALSO, THE BAGGAGE CHECKER 
COULD NOT PROVIDE A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE MALE PASSENGER. 
CONSEQUENTLY, ALL OUTBOUND TRAFFIC THAT HAD TAKEN OFF IN THE 
WINDOW FROM 5:45PM TO 6:00PM WAS RECALLED TO DORVAL AND ALL 
OUTBOUND PLANES ON THE TARMAC AFTER 5:45PM WERE GROUNDED. 
THE SEVERAL RETURNING FLIGHTS WERE RESTERILIZED (ALL 
PASSENGERS AND BAGGAGE WERE RESCREENED), BUT NOTHING WAS 
FOUND. 
 
4.   AT APPROXIMATELY 7:35PM (1935 HOURS) OUTBOUND FLIGHTS 
THAT HAD BEEN WAITING ON THE TARMAC WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE 
OFF.  INBOUND TRAFFIC WAS NEVER AFFECTED.  THERE WAS BEEN 
MINIMAL PRESS COVERAGE OF THE INCIDENT.

1.   SUMMARY.  DOMESTIC OUTBOUND FLIGHTS WERE GROUNDED, 
DELAYED OR RECALLED TO PIERRE ELLIOTT TRUDEAU AIRPORT (AKA 
DORVAL AIRPORT) FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THREE DAYS. THE 
INCIDENT THAT PROMPTED THE SEALING OF THE JETTY OCCURRED AT 
APPROXIMATELY 9:05AM ON SATURDAY (FEB. 14) AND LASTED ABOUT 
FIVE HOURS.  NORMAL OPERATIONS DIDN\'T RESUME UNTIL CLOSE TO 
2:00PM. UNLIKE REFTEL INCIDENT (FEB.11), ACCORDING TO A 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) SUPERVISOR, U.S.-BOUND 
FLIGHTS (FEB. 14) WERE NOT DISRUPTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   A PISTOL-SHAPED CIGARETTE LIGHTER DISRUPTED DOMESTIC 
FLIGHTS (2/14) AT DORVAL AIRPORT.  A CANADIAN AIR TRANSPORT 
SAFETY AUTHORITY (CATSA) AGENT REPORTED HAVING SPOTTED ON 
THE X-RAY OF A CARRYON BAG AN OBJECT RESSEMBLING A PISTOL. 
REPORTEDLY, BY THE TIME THE CATSA AGENT CHECKING BAGS WAS 
ADVISED BY ANOTHER AGENT WHAT HAD BEEN SEEN ON THE X-RAY, 
THE BAG AND ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED INTO THE DOMESTIC 
TERMINAL.  CONSEQUENTLY, AN ALARM WAS SOUNDED AND THE JETTY 
SEALED. 
 
3.  THE OWNER OF THE BAG, A 35-YEAR OLD WOMAN BOUND FOR 
CUBA, ALLEGED SHE WASN\'T AWARE THAT THE OBJECT IN HER 
CARRYON BAG WAS ILLEGAL. 
 
4.  WHILE REFTEL SECURITY BREACH OF TWO DAYS PRIOR RECEIVED 
MINIMAL PRESS ATTENTION, THE LATEST INCIDENT MADE THE FRONT- 
PAGE OF THE FRENCH-LANGUAGE AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS, 
LA PRESSE AND THE MONTREAL GAZETTE, RESPECTIVELY.  LA PRESSE 
CITED A STATEMENT FROM A CATSA AGENT ABOUT MINIMAL TRAINING 
NEW CATSA AGENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO ASSUMPTION OF BAGGAGE 
SCREENING ROLES LAST YEAR.  LA PRESSE ALSO REPORTED THE 
CATSA AGENT MISSED THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER BECAUSE OF BEING 
DISTRACTED BY A PAIR OF SCISSORS IN ANOTHER BAG.  A DHS 
SUPERVISOR, BRIEFED BY AIRPORT SECURITY, DISCUSSED THE 
INCIDENT WITH POST\'S CONSUL GENERAL.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE 
PISTOL-SHAPED CIGARETTE LIGHTER CAUSED THE ALARM, BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE REPORT ABOUT WHAT HAD DISTRACTED THE 
CATSA AGENT. 
 
5. IN THE END, 45 FLIGHTS WERE DELAYED, SOME 400 PASSENGERS 
AND THEIR LUGGAGE WERE RESTERILIZED (RESCREENED) AND 
DOMESTIC OPERATIONS WERE DISRUPTED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE 
HOURS.

SUBJECT:  SIXTH MEETING OF THE ICAO COMMITTEE ON AVIATION 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION:OUTCOME 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  THE U.S. WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING MOST OF 
ITS GOALS AT THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL 
AVIATION ORGANIZATION\'S (ICAO) COMMITTEE ON AVIATION 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (CAEP), HELD IN MONTREAL, FEBRUARY 
2-12, 2004.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULT RELATED TO AIRCRAFT 
NOISE WAS ADOPTION OF ICAO GUIDANCE MATERIAL ON THE BALANCED 
APPROACH TO AIRCRAFT NOISE MANAGEMENT.  ON THE EMISSIONS 
ISSUES, THE COMMITTEE ADOPTED A SIGNIFICANT NEW NOX 
STRINGENCY STANDARD THAT IS A 12% REDUCTION OVER THE CURRENT 
STANDARD.  THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR NEW 
PRODUCTION ENGINES IN 2008.  THE COMMITTEE ALSO AGREED TO 
PURSUE THE USE OF VOLUNTARY MEASURES TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS 
AND TO FURTHER STUDY CO2 EMISSIONS TRADING OPTIONS. 
HOWEVER, AS EXPECTED, THE MEETING FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT 
ON WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING ICAO GUIDANCE ON CHARGES SUPPORTS 
THE APPLICATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS CHARGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION 
ORGANIZATION\'S (ICAO) COMMITTEE ON AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION (CAEP) CONVENED IN MONTREAL ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 
2, 2004.  APPROXIMATELY 185 PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING ALL 19 
CAEP MEMBER STATES AND 11 OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN 
ATTENDANCE.  THE MEETING CONCLUDED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12. 
 
-------------------- 
U.S. DELEGATION 
-------------------- 
 
3.  MR. CARL BURLESON, THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF 
ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY AT THE FEDERAL AVIATION 
ADMINISTRATION (FAA) HEADED THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION AS 
THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO CAEP.  ALSO ON THE DELEGATION, 
SUPPORTING MR. BURLESON FROM THE FAA WERE MR. GARY O\'TOOLE, 
MR. ARCHIE MUCKLE, DR. LOURDES MAURICE, MR. TOM CONNOR, AND 
MR. CURTIS HOLSCLAW.   MR. STEVE SEIDEL AND MR. BRYAN 
MANNING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, MR. 
CHRISTO ARTUSIO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, AND MR. JON 
MONTGOMERY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ALSO SUPPORTED 
MR. BURLESON ON THE DELEGATION. 
 
4.  ALTHOUGH NOT ON THE OFFICIAL U.S. DELEGATION, CERTAIN 
U.S. STAKEHOLDERS WERE IN ATTENDANCE AS MEMBERS ON VARIOUS 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS AND WERE CONSULTED 
THROUGHOUT THE TWO WEEKS IN MONTREAL.  THESE ADVISORS 
REPRESENTED THE AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (ATA), ASSOCIATION 
OF AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES (AIA), GENERAL AVIATION 
MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (GAMA), AND THE CENTER FOR CLEAN 
AIR POLICY (CCAP).  ALSO DURING THE COURSE OF THE MEETING, 
THE HEAD OF THE U.S. DELEGATION CONDUCTED FOUR TELECONS WITH 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY TO APPRISE INTERESTED PARTIES ON THE 
PROGRESS OF THE MEETING. 
 
----------------------------- 
KOTAITE OPENS MEETING 
----------------------------- 
5.  DR. ASSAD KOTAITE, PRESIDENT OF THE ICAO COUNCIL, OPENED 
THE MEETING BY REMINDING THE MEMBERS THAT GLOBAL COOPERATION 
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  AIRCRAFT TODAY ARE MUCH QUIETER AND LESS 
POLLUTING THEN THEIR COUNTERPARTS OF A FEW DECADES AGO DUE 
TO THE CLOSE COOPERATION AMONG MANUFACTURERS, OPERATORS, AND 
REGULATORS.  HE NOTED THAT CAEP/5 HAD SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED 
VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES SUCH AS A NEW NOISE STANDARD, THE 
BALANCED APPROACH TO NOISE MANAGEMENT, AND A WAY FORWARD TO 
LIMIT OR REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 
 
6. DR. KOTAITE CONTINUED BY NOTING THAT CAEP/6 TAKES PLACE 
AT A TIME WHEN THE AVIATION COMMUNITY IS JUST BEGINNING TO 
RECOVER FROM THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001. 
HE THEN DISCUSSED ICAO\'S ELEVATION OF AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL 
MATTERS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION BY THE CREATION OF AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECRETARIAT.  HE CONCLUDED BY 
REMINDING THE MEETING OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ICAO\'S 188 
MEMBER STATES REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENT - ONE OF THE THREE 
MOST IMPORTANT AREAS DEALT WITH BY ICAO TOGETHER WITH SAFETY 
AND SECURITY. 
 
7.  MR. GRAHAM PENDLEBURY, THE CAEP MEMBER FROM THE UNITED 
KINGDOM, WAS CHOSEN BY CONSENSUS AS CHAIR FOR THE MEETING. 
MR. S. TAKANO, THE CAEP MEMBER FROM JAPAN, WAS SELECTED AS 
THE DEPUTY CHAIR, ALSO BY CONSENSUS.  THE U.S. MEMBER 
SUPPORTED BOTH SELECTIONS. 
 
-------------------------------- 
AIRCRAFT ENGINE EMISSIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
8.  NEW NOX STRINGENCY STANDARD. 
 
A.  THE NOX STANDARD DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE CAEP ANALYSIS 
THAT WAS DONE ON SEVERAL SCENARIOS - A 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 
25% AND 30% REDUCTIONS (FROM THE CAEP/4 STANDARD) 
IMPLEMENTED IN EITHER 2008 OR 2012.  THE PRESENTATIONS 
FOCUSED ON THE WORKING ASSUMPTIONS, AND THE RESULTS THAT 
SHOWED THAT 10% WAS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WHEREAS 
HIGHER LEVELS DROVE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITH SMALL 
VERY SMALL GAINS IN NOX REDUCTIONS. .  AT 15% THERE APPEARED 
TO BE A BREAK POINT WHERE GREATER TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES SEEM 
TO GREATLY ESCALATE COSTS.  THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT A 
LOWER STRINGENCY LEVEL (10%) IMPLEMENTED IN 2008 WOULD HAVE 
ALMOST THE SAME EFFECT AS A HIGHER LEVEL (15%) IN 2012. 
 
B.  A NUMBER OF PAPERS WERE SUBMITTED ON THE NOX STRINGENCY 
ISSUE. FIVE EUROPEAN STATES - THE UK, GERMANY, SWEDEN, 
SWITZERLAND, AND NORWAY - SUBMITTED A PAPER CALLING FOR A 
20% INCREASE.  ACI PRESENTED A PAPER THAT CALLED FOR A 20% 
REDUCTION IN 2008 AND A 30% REDUCTION IN 2012, AND ICSA 
REPRESENTING ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS CALLED FOR 30% IN 2012.  THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD SEEMED TO BE IN THE 5% TO 10% RANGE.  THE 
UK ALSO PRESENTED A PAPER THAT QUESTIONED THE CAEP ANALYSIS 
SUGGESTING THAT THE COSTS OF SOME OF THE HIGHER OPTIONS WERE 
OVERESTIMATED AND BENEFITS UNDERESTIMATED. 
 
C.  AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS IN A MEMBERS-ONLY MEETING, IT 
WAS AGREED THAT THE NEW NOX STANDARD WOULD BE A 12% 
REDUCTION EFFECTIVE IN 2008.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT 
REDUCTION - AT LEAST TWICE AS STRINGENT AS PAST CAEP NOX 
STRINGENCY INCREASES.  ALSO, THE MEETING AGREED TO REVISIT 
THE NOX STANDARD AT CAEP/8 (2010) WITH A COMMITMENT TO 
REVIEW LONG TERM GOALS, DEVELOP BETTER MODELING, GATHER 
BETTER TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DATA, AND LOOK AT 
INTERDEPENDENCIES DURING THE INTERVENING 6 YEARS. 
 
9.  PRODUCTION CUT-OFF OF THE CAEP/4 NOX STANDARD.  AN ISSUE 
RELATED TO AGREEMENT ON A NEW NOX STANDARD WAS WHETHER OR 
NOT THERE WOULD BE A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF OF THE CURRENT 
(CAEP/4) STANDARD.  THIS ISSUE BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF 
THE NEGOTIATION ON THE NEW NOX STANDARD.  ALTHOUGH THE U.S. 
POSITION SUPPORTED A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF, NEW INFORMATION WAS 
BROUGHT TO THE MEMBERS-ONLY MEETING THAT AT CAEP/4, THERE 
WAS AGREEMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PRODUCTION CUT-OFF. 
THE CAEP SECRETARY CONFIRMED THIS INFORMATION AND THERE WAS 
A MAJORITY VIEW THAT THE CAEP/4 DECISION SHOULD STAND. 
REALIZING THAT THIS VIEW WAS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE U.S. 
POSITION FOR NOX AT THIS MEETING (AS WELL AS THE UPCOMING 
DISCUSSION ON CHARGES), THE U.S. MEMBER RESPONDED BY 
INSISTING THAT PRODUCTION CUT-OFF WOULD BE REVIEWED IN THE 
TIME LEADING UP TO CAEP/8, AND THE NEED FOR, AND DETAILS OF 
A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF WOULD BE REVISITED AT CAEP/8.  THE 
FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PRODUCTION CUT-OFF 
FOR THE CAEP/4 STANDARD.  HOWEVER, THIS ISSUE WOULD BE PUT 
ON THE FUTURE WORK PROGRAM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
MARKET-BASED OPTIONS (TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS) 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
10.  VOLUNTARY MEASURES.  THE MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO ADOPT A 
VOLUNTARY MEASURES TEMPLATE.  THE TEMPLATE GIVES BASIC 
GUIDANCE AND STRUCTURE TO A POSSIBLE VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT 
TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS.  THE MEETING ACCEPTED THE TEMPLATE, 
AND AGREED THAT CAEP SHOULD EXPLORE HOW THIS TEMPLATE MIGHT 
BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR A REAL VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT, 
POSSIBLY BASED ON OPERATIONAL MEASURES, IN THE FUTURE WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
11.  EMISSIONS (CO2) CHARGES. 
 
A.  THIS WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR THE MEETING, AND 
THE MEMBERS WERE UNABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT OVER THE USE OF 
EMISSIONS CHARGES TO REDUCE CO2 - A GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS. 
THE DEBATE FOCUSED ON THE APPLICABILITY OF EXISTING ICAO 
GUIDANCE TO THESE CHARGES AND WHETHER THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED 
TO DATE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER A NUMBER OF LEGAL, POLICY, 
AND ECONOMIC QUESTIONS RAISED GIVEN THE NOVEL NATURE OF CO2 
CHARGES.  EXISTING ICAO GUIDANCE FOCUSES ON THE MITIGATION 
OF THE LOCAL IMPACT OF EMISSIONS AND NOISE, OR THE PROVISION 
OF SPECIFIC AVIATION SERVICES WHEREAS CO2 IS A GLOBAL 
EMISSION WITH NO LOCAL IMPACT OR HEALTH EFFECTS.  THE 
EUROPEANS BELIEVE THAT EXISTING GUIDANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO GO 
AHEAD WITH CO2 CHARGES.  THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE REST OF 
THE WORLD, OPPOSED CO2 CHARGES SUGGESTING THAT POSSIBLY 
SPECIFIC GUIDANCE COULD BE DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE, BUT ONLY 
AFTER THE OPEN LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED. 
THERE WAS ALSO SENTIMENT BY SOME OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
THAT ANY CHARGING SCHEME EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED- WHETHER ON 
CO2 OR LOCAL AIR QUALITY ISSUES- SHOULD  EXEMPT THEM.. 
 
B.  THE ICAO LEGAL BUREAU CONCLUDED IN A PAPER TO THE 
MEETING THAT EMISSIONS CHARGES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE 
CHICAGO CONVENTION BUT THEY MUST BE BASED ON THE COST OF 
MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, THE COST MUST BE 
IDENTIFIABLE AND DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AVIATION, AND THAT 
THERE WERE OTHER REMAINING LEGAL ISSUES TO BE EXPLORED. 
THESE INCLUDED WHAT IS MEANT BY, AND HOW TO DETERMINE THE 
\"FULL COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE,\" HOW TO IDENTIFY AND 
ESTABLISH CATEGORIES OF COSTS, THE GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF 
APPLICATION, ETC.  THE U.S. SUGGESTED THAT IT IS PREMATURE 
FOR ANY STATE TO IMPLEMENT CO2 CHARGES UNTIL THESE ISSUES 
CAN BE FURTHER STUDIED, AND THAT THESE ISSUES COULD BE TAKEN 
UP BY THE ICAO LEGAL COMMITTEE - A BODY OF MEMBER STATES. 
 
C.  THE MEETING COULD NOT AGREE ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE 
COUNCIL.  INSTEAD, DIFFERING VIEWS WERE DOCUMENTED AND WILL 
BE FORWARDED AS A POLICY ISSUE TO THE ICAO COUNCIL, AND 
POSSIBLY THE 35TH ICAO ASSEMBLY AT THE END OF 2004. 
 
12.  EMISSIONS TRADING. 
 
A.  THE MEETING CONSIDERED THREE OPTIONS (OR \"AVENUES\") FOR 
CONSIDERATION IN FURTHER STUDY OF EMISSIONS TRADING.  THE 
AVENUES WERE A TRADING SCHEME BASED ON 1) INTEGRATED TRADING 
UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, 2) A NEW LEGAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN 
ICAO, AND 3) A VOLUNTARY TRADING APPROACH.  THERE APPEARED 
TO BE GENERAL SUPPORT FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES FOR 
CONTINUING AVENUES 1 AND 3.  MANY SAW AVENUE 3 AS A 
PRECURSOR TO AVENUE 1 WHILE THE U.S. ARGUED THAT A VOLUNTARY 
ARRANGEMENT COULD BE PURSUED ON ITS OWN MERIT - NOT 
NECESSARILY AS A LEAD IN TO A FUTURE MANDATORY ARRANGEMENT. 
THERE WAS NEARLY UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT ON THE ELIMINATION OF 
AVENUE 2 BASED ON THE DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING A NEW ICAO 
LEGAL INSTRUMENT UNDER THE CHICAGO CONVENTION. 
 
B.  DURING THE DEBATE, THE ISSUE OF ALLOCATION OF 
INTERNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CAME UP.  SEVERAL 
STATES FROM EUROPE, AND CANADA AND BRAZIL SUGGESTED THAT THE 
ISSUE OF THE ALLOCATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NEEDED 
TO BE RESOLVED FOR ICAO TO PURSUE THESE EMISSIONS TRADING 
AVENUES - ESPECIALLY AVENUE 1. 
 
C.  FINALLY, LANGUAGE WAS AGREED THAT RULED OUT AVENUE 2 FOR 
FURTHER CONSIDERATION, SUPPORTED FURTHER PURSUIT OF AVENUE 
3, AND AGREED THAT WORK SHOULD CONTINUE ON AVENUE 1 TO 
PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR STATES FOR TRADING SCHEMES CONSISTENT 
WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC PROCESS (THE U.S. 
MANAGED TO GET ANY REFERENCE TO KYOTO DROPPED). 
 
------------------ 
AIRCRAFT NOISE 
------------------ 
13.  BALANCED APPROACH FOR AIRCRAFT NOISE MANAGEMENT.  IN A 
MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE U.S., THE MEETING ADOPTED THE DRAFT 
GUIDANCE MATERIAL ON THE BALANCED APPROACH TO AIRCRAFT NOISE 
MANAGEMENT AS DRAFTED AND AS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.  THE 
DISCUSSIONS PREDICTABLY ADDRESSED WHETHER THE DOCUMENT WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SEND FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION - WAS 
IT COMPLETE, DID IT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ALL MEMBER STATES, 
ETC.?  IN CONCLUSION, THE MEETING ACCEPTED THE MAIN DOCUMENT 
AND MOST OF ITS ANNEXES WITH NO CHANGES.  TWO ANNEXES WILL 
BE REFERRED FOR FUTURE WORK - CASE STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE 
HOW AIRPORTS HAVE APPLIED ELEMENTS OF THE BALANCED APPROACH 
AND INFORMATION ON ENCROACHMENT STUDIES.  THIS WAS A CLEAR 
VICTORY FOR THE U.S. 
 
14.  NOISE CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION. 
 
A.  SEVERAL CAEP MEMBER STATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING TO HAVE ONE 
STANDARDIZED NOISE CERTIFICATE ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT. 
EUROPEAN STATES REQUIRE A STAND-ALONE NOISE CERTIFICATE 
CARRIED ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT WHEREAS THE U.S. DOCUMENTS 
NOISE CERTIFICATION IN THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL.  THERE 
ARE CURRENTLY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS IN USE 
INTERNATIONALLY.  IN VIEW OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN USE FOR NOISE 
CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION, IT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY TO 
ADOPT THREE ALTERNATIVE STANDARDIZED OPTIONS.  THE THREE 
OPTIONS ARE: 
 
  1)   ALL INFORMATION ITEMS CONTAINED IN A SINGLE DOCUMENT, A 
     STAND ALONE NOISE CERTIFICATE; 
 
  2)   TWO COMPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS OF WHICH THE SECOND WOULD 
     BE THE AFM OR THE AIRCRAFT OPERATING MANUAL (AOM); AND 
 
  3)   THREE COMPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS. 
 
B.  ALTHOUGH SEVERAL MEMBERS FAVORED ONE STAND-ALONE NOISE 
CERTIFICATE, IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT THIS PROPOSAL WAS A 
LARGE LEAP FORWARD, AND DUE TO EXISTING STATE PRACTICES, 
GOING ANY FARTHER AT THIS TIME WOULD NOT BE PRACTICABLE. 
THE MEETING AGREED TO ACCEPT THE THREE OPTIONS, BUT TO 
REVISIT THE ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. 
 
15.  ENGINE THRUST DERATE. 
 
A.  THIS DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE METHOD USED TO ENSURE 
COMPLIANCE WITH REDUCED THRUST REQUIREMENTS FOR NOISE 
REDUCTIONS.  THE MEETING CONSIDERED THREE WAYS THAT A THRUST 
DERATE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.  THESE INCLUDED A REVISION TO 
THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL (AFM), A PHYSICAL ENGINE THRUST 
LIMITATION OR A RE-DESIGNATION OF THE ENGINE. 
 
B.  THE EUROPEAN VIEW, ONE ENSHRINED IN EUROPEAN CIVIL 
AVIATION CONFERENCE (ECAC) PROCEDURES, REQUIRES A PHYSICAL 
LIMITATION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.  THE U.S. VIEW, SUPPORTED 
IN A WORKING PAPER PRESENTED BY THE U.S. MEMBER, IS THAT AN 
AFM ENTRY IS SUFFICIENT.  THE U.S. ARGUMENT IS THAT THE AFM 
IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE SAFETY COMPLIANCE, AND HAS BEEN THE 
ACCEPTED METHODOLOGY INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE SAFETY. 
C.  SINCE ALL THREE OPTIONS WILL NEED TO BE EXPLORED IN 
FUTURE WORK, INTERIM GUIDANCE WAS PRESENTED FOR USE WHILE 
THIS ISSUE IS CONSIDERED FURTHER.  THE U.S. AND OTHERS WERE 
CONCERNED THAT THE INTERIM GUIDANCE SEEMED TO BE A STEP-BY- 
STEP PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO PHYSICAL LIMITS.  THE 
INTERIM GUIDANCE WAS FINALLY REDRAFTED TO ONLY SUGGEST THAT 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE, AND THAT IT 
IS UP TO THE CERTIFICATING AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE. 
 
16.  REVISION OF NOISE LEVELS WITHIN THE SAME CHAPTER. 
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY TO BE USED 
IN THE REVISION OF NOISE LEVELS WITHIN THE SAME 
CERTIFICATION STANDARD, OR CHAPTER.  THE MEETING AGREED THAT 
THERE IS A NEED TO REVISE THE NOISE LEVELS OF SOME AIRCRAFT 
WITHIN THE SAME CHAPTER, AND ENDORSED THE NEED TO DEVELOP 
GUIDANCE ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE FUTURE WORK PROGRAM. 
 
17.  ALIGNMENT OF HELICOPTER NOISE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. 
THE MEETING ACCEPTED NEW LANGUAGE FOR ICAO ANNEX 6 - 
OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT, PART III - INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS - 
HELICOPTERS, TO ALIGN ANNEX 6 PROVISIONS WITH THE RELEVANT 
HELICOPTER NOISE PROVISIONS OF ANNEX 16 - ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION, VOLUME I - AIRCRAFT NOISE.  THE TEXT CURRENTLY 
SUGGESTS THAT ALL HELICOPTERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY A NOISE 
CERTIFICATION DOCUMENT WHEN IN FACT SOME HELICOPTERS, AS 
SPECIFIED IN ANNEX 16 ARE EXEMPT FROM NOISE CERTIFICATION 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
---------------------- 
FUTURE WORK 
---------------------- 
18.  CAEP WORKING METHODS.  THE U.S. HAD LED AN INTERNAL 
CAEP TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES OF 
CAEP OVER THE LAST TWO-AND-A HALF YEARS.  THIS WAS INITIATED 
AT THE REQUEST OF THE ICAO PRESIDENT, DR. KOTAITE.  THE TASK 
FORCE RECOMMENDED TO THE MEETING THAT THREE AREAS NEEDED TO 
BE DEVELOPED - ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS, CAEP 
STRUCTURE, AND ICAO RESOURCES. 
A.  GOALS - THESE WOULD NEED TO BE SET NECESSARILY BROAD 
BECAUSE OF THEIR GLOBAL NATURE, AND THE VARYING NEEDS OF 
ICAO\'S 188 MEMBER STATES.  THEY WERE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT IN 
HELPING SET ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES, AND IN 
MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF THE CAEP WORK PROGRAM.  THE MEETING 
AGREED ON THE FOLLOWING:  ICAO IS CONSCIOUS OF ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT OF ITS CONTRACTING STATES TO ACHIEVE 
MAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE SAFE AND ORDERLY 
DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION AND THE QUALITY OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  IN CARRYING ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY, ICAO WILL 
STRIVE TO: 
 
  1)   LIMIT OR REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY 
     SIGNIFICANT AIRCRAFT NOISE; 
 
  2)   LIMIT OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION EMISSIONS ON 
     LOCAL AIR QUALITY; AND 
 
  3)   LIMIT OR REDUCE AVIATION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ON 
     THE GLOBAL CLIMATE. 
 
B.  CAEP STRUCTURE - WITH A VIEW TO STREAMLINING THE 
PROCESS, TO BETTER COORDINATING THE WORK OF VARIOUS TASK 
GROUPS, AND TO START TO DEAL WITH THE INTERDEPENDENCIES OF 
BOTH NOISE AND EMISSIONS, THE MEETING AGREED TO A SLIGHTLY 
STREAMLINED WORKING GROUP STRUCTURE.  THE TECHNICAL WORKING 
GROUPS ON NOISE AND EMISSIONS WOULD REMAIN THE SAME.  THE 
WORK OF WORKING GROUP 2, NOISE - AIRPORTS AND OPERATIONS, 
AND THAT OF WORKING GROUP 4, EMISSIONS - OPERATIONAL ISSUES, 
WOULD BE COMBINED INTO A NEW WORKING GROUP 2, OPERATIONS. 
THIS GROUP WILL DEVELOP GUIDANCE MATERIAL (FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
BALANCED APPROACH), AND EXPLORE OPERATIONAL ISSUES RELATED 
TO AIRCRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE.  CAEP\'S ECONOMICS 
SUPPORT GROUP (FESG) WILL ALSO REMAIN INTACT. 
 
C.  ICAO RESOURCES - THE MEETING AGREED THAT SINCE ICAO HAS 
LISTED ENVIRONMENT AS ONE OF ITS TOP THREE PRIORITIES, 
SECOND ONLY TO SAFETY AND SECURITY, IT WAS TIME TO EXPAND 
CAEP SUPPORT BEYOND SIMPLY HAVING ONE STAFF PERSON ACTING AS 
THE CAEP SECRETARY.  THE MEETING ENDORSED THE CREATION OF AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT WITH DEDICATED STAFFING AND FUNDING. 
THIS HAS BECOME A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE WITHIN CAEP AND ICAO AS 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL ANNOUNCED, A MONTH BEFORE CAEP/6 
STARTED, THAT A UNIT HAD BEEN FORMED.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
UNIT CREATED BY ICAO WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
IN THE CAEP RESTRUCTURING REPORT.  NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE  NO 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, IT PRODUCES MORE COMPLEXITY IN 
COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION- AS ENVIRONMENTAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE MOVED TO THE AIR TRANSPORT BUREAU WHILE 
THE ANNEXES THAT CAEP HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR REMAIN IN THE 
MORE TECHNICAL AIR NAVIGATION BUREAU.  THE REPORT OF THE 
MEETING EXPRESSES THE DISPLEASURE OF SEVERAL MEMBERS OVER 
THIS MOVE AND APPARENT CONTINUING LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPORT 
TO CAEP.  THE U.S. SHARES THESE VIEWS. 
 
19.  U.S. INITIATIVE ON ADDRESSING INTERDEPENDENCIES OF 
VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 
 
A.  THE U.S. DELEGATION ALSO PRESENTED A PAPER ON A VISION 
FOR THE FUTURE - DEVELOPING A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO 
ADDRESSING INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. 
THIS PAPER CALLED ON CAEP TO CONSIDER THE INTERDEPENDENCIES 
BETWEEN NOISE AND EMISSIONS, AND BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 
EMISSIONS, IN ITS FUTURE WORK AND PROPOSED BOTH NEAR-TERM 
AND LONGER-TERM ACTIONS THAT SEEK TO ENHANCE ICAO\'S ABILITY 
TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ASPECT OF ITS MANDATE.  THE U.S. 
VIEWS THIS AS A USEFUL ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR MOVING 
FORWARD IN DEALING WITH AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN AN 
INTEGRATED FASHION. 
 
B.  TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS APPROACH, THE FAA 
HOSTED A RECEPTION AT ICAO HEADQUARTERS FOR THE HEADS OF THE 
MEMBER AND OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOAL WAS TO 
INTRODUCE A METHODOLOGY, AND THE CAPABILITY, TO RECOGNIZE 
AND ADDRESS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES OF ALL ENVIRONMENTAL 
FACTORS - VARIOUS ENGINE EMISSIONS AND NOISE - IN FUTURE 
CAEP WORK AND DECISIONS.  THE FAA PRESENTED ITS WORK ON 
TOOLS TO FOSTER A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ALL ASPECTS 
OF NOISE AND EMISSIONS ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
C.  THERE SEEMED TO BE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE FOR THE U.S. VIEWS 
AND INITIATIVE BY THE MEMBERS, AND AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE 
WORK THAT WOULD SUPPORT SUCH AN APPROACH IN THE FUTURE. 
 
20.  TECHNICAL WORK PROGRAMS.  THE MEETING ACCEPTED A LONG 
LIST OF TASKS FOR THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS WITHOUT 
ATTEMPTING TO PARE THE LIST DOWN OR TO PRIORITIZE THE 
SPECIFIC ITEMS.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE WORKING GROUPS 
WOULD PROVIDE INPUT ON THESE ISSUES TO THE NEXT CAEP 
STEERING GROUP SCHEDULED FOR BONN GERMANY ON NOVEMBER 2004. 
 
21.  THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. DELEGATION WERE PROFESSIONAL 
AND WORKED EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES OF 
THE U.S. POSITION.  DELEGATION MEMBERS REPRESENTED THE 
UNITED STATES WELL AND ARE TO BE COMMENDED

Montreal 
 
REF: State 047117 
 
1.   Summary:  On Monday, March 8, Consul General (CG) 
Bernadette Allen joined Lieutenant Governor Lise Thibault 
and Transport Canada Assistant Deputy Minister for Policy 
Kristine Burr in addressing the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) ambassadors, delegates and staff and 
other invited guests at the celebration of International 
Women\'s Day.    Lt. Gov. Thibault is the highest ranking 
woman dignitary in Quebec and the first woman ever to hold 
her office.  Both CG Allen and Thibault highlighted steps 
needed to further improve the advancement of women.  ICAO 
Secretary General Cherif and ICAO Council President Kotaite 
 
SIPDIS 
also gave brief remarks.  Vice Consul Heidi Arola, post\'s 
Federal Women\'s Program Coordinator, accompanied the CG and 
served as notetaker for the event.  End summary. 
 
2. CG Allen\'s Comments:  Speaking to an audience of a few 
hundred ICAO delegates and staff members, CG Allen\'s remarks 
drew on her experiences as an African-American woman and 
daughter of a single mother as well as the inspiration she 
has received from various women role models. And, given the 
ICAO audience, Allen made special mention of the 
achievements of women aviators and astronauts, including 
Amelia Earhart, Canadian pilot Deanna Brasseur, Russian 
cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, Canadian astronaut Julie 
Payette, and Americans Mae Jamison, and Kalpana Chawla. 
She specifically highlighted the accomplishments of Bessie 
Coleman, the first licensed Black woman pilot who moved to 
France and  earned her pilot\'s license in 1921.   Allen 
emphasized that access to education is the key to opening 
political and economic doors for women and noted that 
education reduces the risks that women and girls face, such 
as sexual exploitation, HIV-AIDS, infant mortality, and 
poverty. 
 
3. Though the program moderator, ICAO Recruitment Officer 
Diana Wall, stated in introductory remarks that  56 percent 
of  ICAO staff members are women, Secretary General Cherif 
ruefully pointed out that most of the positions held by 
women are administrative/clerical and that women hold only 
one-fourth of the \"professional\" positions in ICAO.  Lt. 
Gov. Thibault spoke of the struggles that women face today, 
trying to balance their home lives and professional lives. 
She noted that while it used to be only men who had heart 
attacks in their 50s, more and more women are meeting the 
same fate.  She emphasized that women need to start changing 
their speech patterns; instead of saying \"my children, my 
laundry, my house.\" they need to say \"our children, our 
laundry, our house.\"  According to Thibault, women \"cannot 
do and be everything,\"  they need assistance in order to 
maintain their dignity, values, and souls. 
 
4.  The ICAO Staff Association presented carnations to all 
women who attended the event and sponsored a champagne 
reception afterwards.  Many well-wishers complimented the 
CG\'s remarks and expressed appreciation for U.S. 
participation.

SUBJECT: HEZBOLLAH IN MONTREAL 
 
Classified By: Bernadette Allen, Principal Officer; Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  A Local Canadian Law Enforcement Source 
has informed Post of Terrorist Organizations using Organized 
Crime networks in Montreal to funnel drugs and money with the 
profits going to support terrorism.  There are several 
on-going investigations of these networks and Post asks that 
the information be protected accordingly. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  According to the reliable source cocaine is 
coming from Haiti to Montreal.  The drug couriers are also 
involved with shipping stolen cars out of the US.  Once in 
Montreal members of Hezbollah and other terrorist 
organizations are using established organized crime networks 
to distribute the drugs in Canada.  The money is then 
couriered back to the middle-east.  Both groups are also 
linked to credit card fraud and mortgages schemes. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  The money couriers use several methods to carry 
the money back to the middle-east.  They divide the money 
among several family members to avoid Canadian Customs 
restrictions (a practice known as \"smurfing\").  Under 
Canadian law only individuals carrying more than CAN$10,000 
need to declare the money (as opposed to family units).  Each 
member of the group or family would carry less than 
CAN$10,000; therefore, they did not have to declare the 
money.  In certain cases children were carrying CAN$9,000  in 
cash. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Law enforcement believes that some members of 
Hezbollah are wearing a large gold medallion with a sword and 
Arabic writing to be recognized as a member of Hezbollah. 
The medallion can also be worn in a smaller size by other 
Muslims as a type of \"St Christopher\" medallion; however, the 
medallions worn by members of Hezbollah are 3\"-4\" in size.

1.  SUMMARY:  Quebec\'s energy board is holding hearings 
on whether provincial energy needs require the 
construction of an 836 megawatt gas plant, the Suroit, 
in Beauharnois, located 25 miles from Montreal and the 
U.S. border.  The Board\'s recommendations, and the 
report of a provincial legislative commission in 
October, will have a major impact on Quebec\'s 
electricity generating capacity. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  In fall 2001, the Parti Quebecois government of 
Bernard Landry first announced the $500 million 836 
megawatt combined-cycle natural gas plant, to be built 
in Beauharnois, a town located 25 miles between 
Montreal and the U.S. border.  The plant, named \"le 
Suroit\" (southerly wind in English) was billed as 
necessary to help Quebec bridge a projected energy gap 
until larger new hydro-electric projects come on-line 
between 2008 and 2010. 
 
3.  Quebec\'s new Liberal government had initially hoped 
that some of its budgetary woes, inherited from the 
former Parti Quebecois government, could be resolved 
through increased profit generation by Hydro Quebec 
(last year HQ contributed $1.1 billion to provincial 
coffers).  Liberal Finance Minister Yves Seguin had 
even suggested that HQ could generate an additional 
$600 million in annual income for the province.  But, 
in the face of increasing opposition to the Suroit from 
environmental and community activists, in February 
Premier Jean Charest delayed approval of the project 
and asked that Quebec\'s independent energy board, the 
Rgie de l\'nergie, study Quebec\'s energy needs and 
make recommendations on how these needs can best be 
met.  The Regie is in the process now of hearing 
g 
presentations on the Suroit from environmentalists and 
Hydro-Quebec officials.  The Regie is scheduled to 
present its report on June 30. 
 
4.  Hydro Quebec itself is adamant that the Suroit 
project is necessary, making the case that provincial 
energy demand alone requires the plant\'s construction. 
According to HQ, provincial demand increased to 165 
terawatts (Twh) in 2003, three years sooner than the 
utility had projected.  But critics of the project 
charge that the plant is only needed in order to 
generate more profits from exports to the U.S. market. 
 
5. To convince the Regie and the Quebec public of the 
precariousness of energy supply in the province, Hydro 
has taken the unusual step of releasing data on the 
water levels behind its dams, information that the 
company has kept secret for the past six years because 
of market competition concerns.  A sharp drop in 
precipitation combined with greater provincial and 
export sales accounted for the lowest water levels 
since 1991, HQ president Andre Caille revealed on 
February 20 in a report presented to the Regie.  The 
report detailed that on January 1, 2004, Hydro Quebec 
held electricity reserves of 75.1 Twh down from 96.2 
Twh a year before, according to HQ figures.  Compared 
to 2000, the dams have 40 Twh less potential.  The lack 
of rain accounted for a loss of 23 Twh in 2003 alone. 
On any given day, Hydro-Quebec\'s goal has been to have 
60 percent of its yearly projected demand in reserve. 
However, in 2002, those reserves averaged 67 percent of 
projected demand; in 2004, reserve averages fell to 
43.7 percent, the lowest percentage since 1991, 
according to the HQ report presented to the Regie. 
 
6.   Environmental NGOs believe Hydro is over- 
dramatizing the supply situation, saying that the 
province can wait until new hydroelectric projects, 
considered \"cleaner,\" than gas, come on line in 2008, 
even if it means importing more energy from the U.S. 
for a few years.  The Quebec media has repeatedly 
published figures, released by Greenpeace, stating that 
the Suroit increase Quebec\'s greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2.6 percent.  Opponents to the Suroit say the need 
for the plant would vanish if Quebecers simply used 
electricity more efficiently.  The very negative press 
has raised alarms in Beauharnois, where the mayor and 
the population fear the plant\'s emissions will be 
harmful to health and quality of life. 
 
7.   Some analysts have pointed out that while 
environmental groups are fighting the Suroit plant 
ferociously, they have essentially ignored a similar 
550 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration power plant in 
Becancour, 100 miles to the north of the Suroit. 
Becancour will be developed by the TransCanada Corp., 
which will supply its entire production to Hydro-Quebec 
under a 20-year power purchase contract.  The $500 
million Becancour plant is scheduled to be in service 
in late 2006. 
 
8.   Hydro Quebec officials claim that the Suroit will 
use the most efficient and cleanest technology 
available.  As currently conceived, the Suroit would be 
the first plant in North America to use the 60-hertz 
version of General Electric\'s H System, touted as 
providing an efficiency range of 60 percent. But GE 
Quebec spokesperson Sylvain Bulota said on March 17 that 
if delays persist, GE will withdraw the advantageous 
financial package it offered Hydro.  On March 16, GE 
officials met with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and 
Hydro One representatives who are reportedly also very 
interested in GE\'s 7HMD technology.  Under the present 
plan for the Suroit, GE would assume all of the 
projected ($550 million) construction costs of the 
Suroit and operate the plant for several years before 
turning it over to Hydro.   If the GE technology is 
introduced first in Ontario, Hydro-Quebec would not get 
the advantageous financial package linked to introducing 
a new technology. 
 
9. According to Hydro Quebec Environment Director Pierre- 
Luc Desgagns, if the Regie unequivocally reports that 
the province needs the production from the Suroit, no 
other study would be needed to go ahead with the 
project.  However, if the Regie\'s recommendation is 
tepid or contains caveats, a provincial legislative 
commission -- with the specific mandate of deciding the 
Suroit\'s fate -- would start meeting in July or August. 
The opposition to the project has already delayed the 
start of construction by 18 months. The latest 
optimistic schedule has Suroit coming on line in Spring 
2008. 
 
10. National Energy Board figures for January 2004 show 
Hydro exported 562,205 megawatt hours (export figures 
include all sales outside the province, including the 
U.S., Ontario and New Brunswick) while it imported 
392,789 MWh for profits of $28.7 million, a drop from 
the previous year when the company exported 1,304,666 
MWh and imported 562,205 MWh.  In percentages, imports 
increased by 75 percent while exports dropped 57 
percent.  Hydro disputes the import figures saying they 
do not take into account sizeable HQ purchases made in 
Ontario and New Brunswick. 
 
11. The fact that the province of Quebec became a net 
importer of electricity in 2004 will not prevent Hydro 
from exporting to the U.S. Northeast markets this 
summer, says Gilles Favreau, HQ\'s Director of External 
Regulatory Affairs.  In summer, provincial consumption 
is at its lowest, making surplus production available 
for export sales as usual. \"However, the next few 
winters could be hectic. Moreover, with the competition 
now informed about our low water levels, the 
electricity we will need to import could be more 
expensive,\" says Favreau. 
 
12.  COMMENT: It is clear that the Charest government 
would like to see the Suroit built.  But their party\'s 
current unpopular standing in public opinion has made 
the Liberals timid about confronting environmental and 
community groups, and addressing the expectations of 
Quebecers that their electricity will be forever 
provided cheaply, cleanly and abundantly.  Further, the 
notion that the province should limit itself to 
supplying Quebec demand, regardless of profitable 
opportunities to export energy, seems to be gaining 
traction in the public debate, if not in political 
circles.

SUBJECT: Montreal Jewish School Firebombed on Passover 
 
Ref:  Toronto 000564 
 
1. A private Jewish school in Montreal\'s St. Laurent 
neighborhood was firebombed in the early morning hours 
of April 5, the first day of the Passover holiday.  The 
firebombing took place between 2.a.m. and 3 a.m. in the 
library of the United Talmud Torah St. Laurent School 
on de l\'Eglise Street. There were no casualties. 
 
2. Inspector Yves Surprenant, of the Montreal Police 
Department, was quoted in media accounts as saying 
that, \"What was written on the paper stuck to the door 
has made us believe it was a hate crime\" but the police 
would not confirm media accounts that the note, written 
in French, made reference to recent attacks against 
Palestinians including the killing of Sheik Ahmed 
Yassin in Gaza. 
 
3. Local and federal politicians, including the Prime 
Minister, were quick to condemn the incident, and a 
rally was held outside the school yesterday, attended 
by Montreal Mayor Gerald Tremblay, Federal Justice 
Minister Irwin Cotler, and leaders of the Montreal 
Jewish Community.  Cotler, a graduate of the school and 
a noted human rights lawyer, was reported to have told 
the rally, \"Yes, as students we received anti-Semitism, 
but it was the anti-Semitism of ignorance, of 
stereotyping, of prejudice.  What we have witnessed 
here today is the anti-Semitism of hate and of racism.\" 
 
4.  Quebec Premier Jean Charest released a statement as 
well, noting, \"Setting fire to a school is already a 
vile act, since it touches the future of our society. 
But when it is done in the name of racism and 
intolerance, every Quebecer must stand up to denounce 
it so that it never happens again.\"  The president of 
the Canadian Islamic Conference, for his part, is 
quoted as saying that the \"agony will be double if the 
fire was committed by a Muslim.\" 
 
5.  Security surveillance of Jewish institutions in 
Montreal will be stepped up, and as will that of Muslim 
mosques, \"in case of any counter-acts,\" according to a 
Montreal police spokeswoman. 
 
6.  This act comes just a few weeks after a series of 
anti-Semitic vandalism incidents occurred in the 
greater Toronto area (reftel).  Federal and local 
leaders, as they did in Montreal, loudly condemned the 
crimes committed in Toronto.  In addition, the Toronto 
police service has announced the arrest of three 
individuals in connection with the vandalism.  Taken 
together, however, these two high-profile events 
bolster statistics recently released by B\'nai Brith 
that suggest that anti-semitic incidents are on the 
rise in Canada. 
 
7.  The Consulate left messages of sympathy with the 
Quebec offices of the Canadian Jewish Congress and the 
B\'Nai Brith Canada; both organizations were apparently 
closed for the Passover holiday.

Classified By: PRINCIPAL OFFICER BERNADETTE M. ALLEN, REASONS 1.5(B) 
AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Media reports of a botched security exercise 
at PET International Airport prompted post\'s Principal 
Officer (PO) to contact Aeroport de Montreal Corporation 
(ADM) President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James 
Cherry and the Department of Homeland Security Pre-Inspection 
Facility Officer-in-Charge (OIC) for details on the incident. 
 CEO Cherry called the incident, the planting of TNT in a 
passenger\'s luggage, an embarrassing mistake.  DHS OIC 
provided more insight on how the mistake occurred.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) Several newspapers reported that security officials at 
PET (formerly known as Dorval) Airport conducted a routine 
security exercise on the night of Friday, May 7, 2004, that 
later proved an embarrassment to the ADM.  Explosives (TNT in 
a mason jar) which were to be planted in ADM test luggage 
and, subsequently were to be detected by a canine, instead 
mistakenly landed in a passenger\'s personal luggage.  The 
routine canine exercises reportedly are conducted daily, 
using ADM\'s own luggage or suitcases that have long gone 
unclaimed. 
 
3. (U) The traveller discovered the TNT in his bag upon 
arrival at his home in a suburb of Montreal, after he went to 
remove his toothbrush from his luggage.  He found the mason 
jar with markings \"explosives\" and immediatelly contacted the 
Surete de Quebec (local law enforcement).  The SQ evacuated 
the homes in the area and removed the TNT, which ADM and 
local law enforcement reported lacked a detonator and 
elements to cause an explosion. 
 
4. (C) ADM CEO Cherry informed PO that the ADM agent who 
planted the material has been severely reprimanded and he 
added, possibly may even be fired for the mistake. 
 
 
5. (D) DHS OIC informed PO that at the airport debrief, DHS 
inspectors were informed that the ADM agent had placed the 
TNT in a bag in the lost and found department.  Reportedly, 
within a five-minute, at which time the agent left the bag 
unattended, the traveller just happened to pass through Lost 
and Found to retrieve his bag.  Consequently, the canine 
never had a chance to sniff out the test jar. 
 
6. (C) PO asked CEO Cherry whether this incident and two 
others in February (see reftels) raise security concerns at 
PET airport.  Cherry was quick to say \"no\" and emphasized 
that reftel incidents were completely unrelated to the ADM 
exercise.  He mentioned that the Canadian Air Transport 
Safety Authority (CATSA) was solely responsible for the 
February incidents.  (Note:  DHS reported on an aiport 
baggage handler\'s hiring on April 22, 2004, and the same 
employee\'s firing the very next day (April 23, 2004), for his 
website: www.theforum.com/showthread.php?t=3414, that states, 
\"Guess who\'s now able to bomb your airplane\" and \"Dats right! 
Got a nice side job airport security/runway crew.  He had 
also scanned his airport ID on the website.  End note.)

1. Per reftel A request, post\'s Principal Officer contacted 
Port of Montreal (POM) Security Director Felixpier Bergeron 
to inquire about the POM\'s progress in completing a plan of 
action to comply with the new international regulations and 
standards set by the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) International Shipping and Port Security Code (ISPS). 
 
2. Security Director Bergeron, drafter of the POM plan, 
reported that the Montreal plan is completed.  He added that 
Transport Canada representatives visited the POM on 
yesterday (May 11), reviewed the plan and were pleased with 
it.  He stated that translation of the plan from English to 
French, which is expected to be completed in two weeks, is 
the only detail holding up Transport Canada\'s final 
approval. 
 
3. Bergeron pointed out that the POM plan may differ from 
most other ports\' plans because it is a Master Plan that 
consists of 29 sub-plans, one sub-plan for each facility or 
activity that interfaces with the port.  For example, he 
said there is a separate plan for the pilot boats\' 
terminal, the petroleum terminal, etc.  The estimated price 
tag to implement the POM plan is approximately $9 million 
(Canadian). 
 
4. In response to PO\'s question about possible technical 
assistance needs, Bergeron emphasized that the POM has had 
in place for almost two years enhanced access controls and a 
top-flight camera surveillance program that is monitored in 
the Harbor Master\'s Control Center.  (Note: PO learned on an 
April 26 POM visit arranged for WHA DAS Jewell, that 
redundant images from the camera surveillance program are 
routed to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police office located at 
the port.  End note.)  Bergeron also mentioned that other 
international port authorities (ie., Marseille, France and 
Dakar, Senegal) have visited and/or have arranged imminent 
visits to the POM, to study the POM plan and/or consult on 
the preparation of their ports\' respective plans.

REF: A) 2003 Montreal 1076 (NOTAL) 
 
B) 2002 Montreal 0412 (NOTAL) 
 
1.   (U) Summary.  Aeroports de Montreal (ADM) Corporation 
President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Cherry and 
Chairman of the Board Pierre Martin rolled out the ADM 2003 
annual report at a May 6, 2004 public meeting held at the 
International Civil Aviation Organization Headquarters in 
Montreal.  The meeting highlighted the ADM Corporation\'s 
strategic growth plan that focuses on three core sectors: 
passenger traffic, air cargo and industrial development. 
Montreal-Trudeau Airport will serve as the hub for domestic, 
transborder and international passenger traffic, while 
Montreal-Mirabel Airport will be revamped into an industrial 
and all-cargo airport.  CEO Cherry emphasized that passenger 
volume (8.9 million) and cargo volume (242,193 tons) had 
increased by 1.5% and 3.9%, respectively, from the 2002 
numbers.  Cherry stated that ADM optimistically anticipates 
a fifteen percent (15%) increase in passenger volume in 
2004, mostly as a result of increased numbers of flights 
from low-cost carriers.  He also reported several 
international charter carriers plan to offer new, direct, 
weekly flights between Montreal and a few European capitals; 
domestically, additional flights between Montreal and Quebec 
City are on the horizon.  A preliminary proposal to improve 
passenger accessibility to Montreal-Trudeau is anticipated 
for completion in June 2004.  End summary. 
 
2.    (U) ADM is the corporation responsible for the 
management, Operation and development of Montreal-Trudeau 
Airport (MMA) (formerly known as Dorval International 
Airport) and Montreal-Mirabel Airport (MMA).  In 1992, ADM 
entered a 60-year lease with Transport Canada to manage both 
facilities. 
 
3.   (U) Board Chairman Martin opened the public meeting by 
announcing that passenger and cargo volume increased and 
that the Phase I project to expand MTA was completed on 
schedule and within budget.  He reported the Phase II 
project, expansion of the international jetty, is thirty- 
seven percent (37%) complete. 
 
4.   (U) ADM\'s three-point growth plan focuses on passenger 
traffic, air cargo and industrial development.  In January 
2004, ADM signed an agreement with charter carrier Air 
Transat, ADM\'s second largest carrier (after Air Canada), to 
relocate its head office, its aircraft maintenance center 
and aircraft to MTA.  ADM expects all charter flights from 
Montreal to be operating out of Montreal-Trudeau by late 
2004.  A new international and transborder arrivals complex 
which will contain a new Canadian Customs hall and baggage 
claim area is scheduled to open in November 2004, followed 
by the inauguration of a new international jetty in July 
2005.  ADM plans to launch an international request for 
proposals to redevelop MMA, to make use its terminal, hotel 
and administrative buildings. 
 
5.    (U) In addition to highlighting that 8.9 million 
passengers (1.5% increase) and 242,193 tons of cargo (3.9% 
increase) transited the ADM facilities in 2003, on the 
environmental side, CEO Cherry emphasized that the noise 
footprint at the Montreal facilities is now fifty percent 
(50%) below the 1995 reference area.  He stated the number 
of citizens affected by the noise footprint fell to seventy 
percent (70%) below the 1995 reference level.  ADM 
management expects the commissioning of a new thermal power 
plant at MTA to cut the airport\'s energy consumption by 
fifty percent (50%). 
 
6.   (U) CEO Cherry anticipates as much as a fifteen percent 
(15%) increase in passenger traffic stemming from 
international charters that will offer flights to new, 
weekly destinations between Montreal and a few European 
capitals.  He specifically mentioned the following 
international charters: Thomas Cook (to/from London), Zoom 
Airlines (to/from London and Paris), Air Plus Comet (to/from 
Madrid) and Transaero (to/from Moscow).  Domestically, ADM 
expects an increase in flights offered by Air Labrador 
between Montreal and Quebec City. 
 
7.    (U) ADM management underscored that its primary 
concern relates to municipal taxes, to the tune of 21.3 million 
Canadian dollars (CAD) in 2003 (the MTA portion - 18 million 
CAD).  CEO Cherry stated that Montreal pays the highest per 
passenger tax compared to all the other Canada airports, 
approximately 2.21 CAD per passenger.  ADM management 
reported that it signed an agreement with the City of 
Montreal that will limit some tax growth for the next three 
years, but added the corporation seeks \"a permanent, 
equitable basis\" for determining its tax contributions. 
ADM\'s second priority concern is the amount of rent paid to 
Transport Canada (4.8 million CAD in 2003).  The third 
priority issue is passenger accessibility to MTA.  A 
preliminary proposal to improve road access and city and 
intercity rail connections to the MTA is planned for 
completion in June 2004.  A related impact study is 
scheduled for completion by August 2004.  ADM expects a 
final proposal will be ready in November 2006, to integrate 
a rail connection to MTA -- the anticipated construction 
completion date is in the 2007-2008 period. 
 
8.   (SBU) On May 11, 2004, as a followup to ADM\'s public 
meeting, post\'s Principal Officer contacted CEO Cherry to 
inquire whether the Phase II plans will address the long- 
standing concern of Department of Homeland Security 
personnel at the Pre-Flight Inspection Facility; that is, 
lack of screening of passengers and baggage prior to the DHS 
inspectors\' interviewing and pre-clearance of passengers. 
Cherry responded that Phase II plans do not address the DHS 
employees\' concern, but he hinted that the Phase III 
proposals (June 2004) may accelerate renovations that would 
respond to the DHS employees\' concern.

SUBJECT: Implementation of Capetown Convention 
 
 
1.  Summary: ICAO Preparatory Commission selects Ireland as 
host country for new International Registry for financing 
interests in aircraft. 
 
2.  The Capetown Diplomatic Conference established a 
Preparatory Commission of 20 states, including the U.S., to 
set up the new international registry, in conjunction with 
ICAO.  Once established, the ICAO Council will act as 
supervisory authority over the registry.  Timing for 
establishment of the registry is critical to keeping the 
convention system on track, which is expected to come into 
force by late 2004 or early 2005. 
 
3.  The outlines of the new system were developed by a task 
force co-chaired by the U.S. and France as the largest 
aircraft manufacturing states.  As co-chairs, both countries 
agreed not to bid to be the host country. 
 
4.  The ICAO Secretariat administered a sealed-bid 
procurement, drawing on air transportation and procurement 
expertise from states; which included FAA experts. 
 
5.  The Preparatory Commission was chaired by Switzerland 
(Laurent Noel) and attended by ICAO Secretary General Taieb 
Cherif and Council President Assad Kotaite. 
 
6.  Four countries supported bids from registry companies 
based in their territories; Canada, Ireland, Singapore and 
Spain.  Bids were first available to the Preparatory 
Commission this week.  Selection of Ireland followed the 
rankings by the ICAO Secretariat\'s procurement team. 
 
7.  A critical factor was cost, which will drive the fee 
schedules to be established later.  Ireland, Singapore and 
Canada had technically acceptable proposals.  A considerable 
gap existed between the lowest bidder, Ireland which 
estimated start-up costs and first year operations at $ 2.7 
million, compared to Singapore at $6.7 million and Canada at 
$7.7 million.  Negotiations with the lowest bidder are 
expected to reach a fee structure acceptable to the air 
transport industry. 
 
8.  All U.S. Agency reps participating (DOT, FAA, State, 
EXIM Bank), as well as U.S./Industry reps, including Boeing, 
Pratt & Whitney, and the Aircraft Working Group (AWG) 
supported the selection process and the result. 
 
9.   The Preparatory Commission agreed to initiate final 
contract negotiations without delay assisted by the U.S., 
Finance, AWG and IATA.  FAA staff expert Moffat is expected 
to continue to assist ICAO.  The Regulations Working Group 
(chaired by the U.S. - FAA Klang) will also proceed to 
complete its work by December. 
 
10.  ICAO will initiate a draft Headquarters Agreement with 
the GOI. 
 
11.  U.S. Delegation included: US Rep: HBurman (State), 
Alternate Rep: JKlang (FAA), PBloch (DOT), JStandell (FAA), 
and LEmery (EXIM Bank).  CMoffat (FAA) assisted the ICAO. 
U.S. Mission Ambassador Stimpson coordinated the U.S. effort 
and the interface with U.S. industry representatives.

Grand Chief James Gabriel told Consulate representatives on 
June 17.  Gabriel, who has not been able to return to 
Kanesatake since his home was burned to the ground in 
January, said that the specter of the 1990 Oka crisis and 
fear of deadly violence, have prevented the Surete du Quebec 
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from taking action. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Accompanied by aid Dean Dussault, Grand Chief James 
Gabriel spoke to Consulate officers for over an hour and a 
half about the trouble-plagued Kanesatake reserve, one of 
three Mohawk territories in the province of Quebec. 
Kanesatake (population 1,400) located on the North shore of 
the Saint Lawrence river some 50 kilometers from Montreal, 
was the sight of the 1990 Oka crisis, in which opposition to 
the expansion of a golf course on Mohawk burial grounds led 
to a summer-long stand-off between Mohawk warriors and SQ 
officers and Canadian Forces and resulted in the death of an 
SQ officer. 
 
3. (C) Chief Gabriel said that the narcotics trade in 
Kanesatake took off in the mid-1990s.  He noted that there 
had been an SQ intervention in 1995, led by then Quebec 
Public Security Minister Serge Menard, in which 20 to 30 
acres and 100,000 marijuana plants were destroyed, yet no 
arrests were made.  After the raids, marijuana cultivation 
moved inside, with as many as five underground bunkers 
constructed to house hydroponic grow-operations on the 
territory.  Gabriel estimated that between five and seven 
hundred pounds of marijuana is smuggled off the territory 
each week, for export to the United States.  Gabriel said 
that the drug traffic now also includes heroin and other hard 
drug sales.  Gabriel believes that an investigation of the 
money trail would show that the local bank in Oka sued by 
Kanesatake residents, the Caisse Populaire, is awash in large 
American dollar deposits. 
 
4. (C) Chief Gabriel identified the leaders of the narcotics 
trade as Robert and Gary Gabriel (both of whom are related to 
James Gabriel) and said they are affiliated with the Hells\' 
Angels biker gang, and to a lesser extent, Chinese and 
Russian mafia groups.  According to James Gabriel, Robert 
Gabriel, has never had a full-time job -- and his wife 
recently applied for welfare -- yet Robert lives in a home 
worth several hundred thousand dollars and drives expensive 
cars. 
 
5. (C) Gabriel was first elected Kanesatake Grand Chief in 
2001, though in effect he led a minority government as four 
of the seven Band Council members were \"less than 
enthusiastic about law enforcement.\"  However, in July 2003 
elections, Gabriel gained a majority; he and three other 
Council members took a decision to bring the territory\'s 
ineffective police force \"back up to par\" and Gabriel began 
talking to the SQ and RCMP about support for action against 
the criminal elements that had taken root on the reserve. 
Gabriel said that plans to replace the police chief and bring 
in an outside aboriginal police unit were leaked, however, 
and the new force got \"boxed in\" at police headquarters on 
January 12, leading to the 30-hour blockade by masked, armed 
men surrounding the station (see Ref. A). 
 
6. (C) Quebec Public Security Minister Jacques Chagnon\'s 
negotiation of a temporary fix -- which reinstated the old 
police chief and brought in Mohawk peacekeepers from the 
near-by Kahnawake reserve to serve as an interim police force 
-- was mainly \"an image-boosting\" exercise, according to 
Gabriel.  The peacekeepers did little to police the territory 
and ultimately left in March.  There has been no real 
policing in Kanesatake since January, Gabriel said. 
 
7. (C) The three chiefs on the Band Council who side with 
Gabriel, Chiefs Clarence Simon, Marie Chene and Doreen 
Canatonquin, remain in Kanesatake but are keeping low 
profiles because they face harassment by people loyal to the 
dissident chiefs and criminal gangs.  Gabriel said that the 
dissident chiefs, John Harding, and Pearl and Steven 
Bonspile, periodically make appearances in the media, 
\"wrapping themselves in the cloak of Mohawk sovereignty.\" 
Gabriel said that the whole Band Council never meets; when 
decisions have to be taken regarding the administration of 
the territory, Gabriel meets with Chiefs Simon, Chene and 
Contonquin at the hotel in Laval (about two kilometers from 
Kanesatake) where Gabriel has lived since January.  The 
dissident chiefs have called for an election on July 14 to 
choose a new Grand Chief, claiming that James Gabriel has 
abandoned the territory.  But James Gabriel says that there 
is no way a fair election, supervised by an impartial, 
outside monitoring organization, can be held in July.  James 
Gabriel said that any election will have to be delayed; 
lawyers have advised him that the current Band Council could 
remain in power for a few months beyond their mandate if 
conditions do not permit an election. 
 
8. (C) Gabriel has been in continuous dialogue with the SQ 
and RCMP to reestablish a police force, but to date, police 
officers have only patrolled the highway surrounding 
Kanesatake, and not actually entered the territory.  The SQ 
has been working with a Mohawk police force in preparation to 
re-enter the territory, but so far has held back entering 
Kanesatake, leading to much frustration on the Mohawks\' part. 
 Gabriel said that there has been friction recently between 
the Mohawk police and their SQ sponsors; cooperation has been 
threatened by a personnel dispute, and mistrust on both 
sides.  At bottom, the Mohawk force would like to enter the 
territory and begin enforcing the law; the SQ feels the time 
is not right, and that violence would ensue if either or both 
the SQ and the Mohawk force were to go into Kanesatake. 
 
9. (C) Though it is clear that Gabriel is in close contact 
with the Quebec government (which is putting him up in the 
Laval hotel), Gabriel expressed deep frustration over the 
unwillingness of either the Quebec or federal government to 
bring law and order to Kanesatake.  Though the Oka crisis has 
been repeatedly raised by the Quebec media and government 
officials, Gabriel said the current situation is very 
different from 1990, when the Kanesatake population and 
Mohawks from the other Quebec reserves supported the Mohawk 
warriors\' stance.  He said that the traditional Mohawk 
Warrior Society, which stood up during the Oka crisis, and 
\"the group of thugs\" calling itself warriors in Kanesatake 
today are different.  Other First Nations tribes in Quebec 
have been supportive of Gabriel, citing their concern about 
the vulnerability of their own native communities to 
organized crime infiltration.  Gabriel said that the only 
support that the dissident Chiefs have been able to summon is 
from professional activists like Jaggi Singh and Sean Brandt. 
 And, contrary to claims made by SQ officials to the Quebec 
Consul General in May (see Ref B), Gabriel says there has 
been no influx of Mohawks from other reserves, in Canada or 
the Untied States. 
 
10. (C) Gabriel is disheartened by the Quebec Security 
Minister Jacques Chagnon\'s repeated characterizations of the 
problem as a dispute between Mohawk factions that an election 
could resolve.  He feels that Chagnon, supported by Quebec 
Premier Jean Charest, simply wants the Kanesatake situation 
to be \"quiet,\" even if the drug trade and criminal activity 
flourish.  But Gabriel said that young people on the 
territory -- who have few employment opportunities -- are 
influenced by the apparent affluence and lifestyles of the 
drug dealers and criminals.  He believes the criminal 
activity problems will only grow worse, as more community 
members are drawn into it. 
 
11. (C) Gabriel also cited fears of people \"taking the law 
into their own hands.\"  He said that people on both sides of 
the conflict have arms in Kanesatake.  According to (James) 
Gabriel, in addition to hunting weapons, Gary Gabriel has 
explosives, assault weapons and rocket launchers.  \"Most of 
our community members can recognize the sound of an AK-47,\" 
Gabriel said.  Gabriel and his aid Dussault both emphasized 
the difficulty for the \"silent majority\" in Kanesatake to 
speak out in their small community against criminals that 
everyone knows and sees often.  But given the prevalence of 
weaponry on the territory, Gabriel said he is very afraid 
that \"blood feuds\" will surface.\" 
 
12.  (U) Grand Chief Gabriel gave an exclusive interview to 
the Journal de Montreal on the same day he visited the 
Consulate.  During the course of the interview, he revealed 
something he had mentioned briefly to us: the fact that for 
the past year Kanesatake has been under the administrative 
supervision of the Ministry of Indian Affairs, assigned to a 
PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant working full-time from an 
office in Oka (situated next to the Kanesatake territory). 
According to Gabriel, Kanesatake had racked up an accumulated 
deficit of C$4 million by 2003.  Ottawa had imposed financial 
supervision prior to Gabriel\'s attaining the majority on the 
Band Council that year, Gabriel emphasized. 
 
13.  (U) The tabloid Journal focused on the fact that part of 
the territory\'s deficit stemmed from mortgage payments made 
on individual Kanesatake homes -- including that of Robert 
Gabriel -- that the Ministry of Indian Affairs deducted from 
Kanesatake\'s budget.  Apparently, the Ministry customarily 
co-signs mortgage loans for native applicants.  According to 
what James Gabriel told Le Journal, when Robert Gabriel was 
unable to make payments on his $185,000 mortgage, the 
Ministry of Indian Affairs paid the debt in full, subtracted 
the sum from the Band Council\'s budget, and transferred the 
property -- a large mansion with a pool -- to the Council\'s 
ownership.  However, Robert Gabriel and his family continued 
to live there.  Robert Gabriel, who has been accused of 
participating in the January 12 riot and blockade at the 
police station, is under court order currently to stay away 
from Kanesatake. 
 
14.  (C) Gabriel\'s story conforms to information gathered 
from law enforcement contacts of the Consulate.  There is 
indeed great concern on the part of both the federal and 
provincial police about the arms on the territory, and the 
deadly confrontations that could result if a full-scale raid 
were to be mounted and a new police unit installed.  We 
understand that an RCMP force would be prepared to enter 
Kanesatake territory if \"something blows\" and violence 
occurs, but for now, both the SQ and the RCMP are holding 
back.  The fate of James Gabriel and his Mohawk police force 
remains to be seen.  He told us that he is concerned the 
Kanesatake situation will fade from he public eye if 
enforcement actions are not taken soon.  But he was equally 
certain that the territory is a tinderbox, ready to explode.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, CA, Bloc Quebecois, Elections 
SUBJECT: QUEBECERS GIVE BLOC QUEBECOIS 54 SEATS, PUNISHING 
LIBERALS 
 
1. This cable was jointly prepared by the Montreal and 
Quebec City Consulates. 
 
2. SUMMARY: As predicted, the Bloc Quebecois took 54 of 75 
possible seats in Quebec in yesterday\'s Federal election, 
gaining 21 seats in Parliament, and matching the party\'s 
1993 seat count, when former Bloc leader and founder Lucien 
Bouchard led the newly-born party to victory.  Quebec voters 
were the least volatile in Canada, as election-day results 
matched what pollsters had measured from the outset of the 
campaign.  Although the Conservatives came in second in a 
few races, neither they nor the New Democratic Party, which 
came in behind the Green party in many ridings, elected 
anyone in the province. 
 
3. Some have called the Bloc\'s performance a resurrection, 
since only a year ago the party\'s imminent demise was 
predicted by many pundits. However, handed the gift of the 
corporate sponsorship scandals -- and Liberal stumbling in 
its Quebec strategy -- Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe adroitly 
managed an almost mistake-free campaign, shrewdly depicting 
himself and his party as trust-worthy and competent Quebec- 
firsters, while downplaying his party\'s sovereignist goals 
in order to make in-roads among non-separatist Quebec 
voters.  While Separatist militants are buoyed by the 
election results, many Quebecers cast a protest vote  for 
the Bloc, because they wanted to punish the Liberals, and 
couldn\'t stomach the Conservatives. END SUMMARY 
 
Campaign Conduct 
 
4. The corporate sponsorship scandals figured hugely in the 
election results.  Gilles Duceppe, in his victory speech, 
reiterated that the loyalty of Quebecers cannot be bought, a 
reference to the Chretien government\'s channeling of funds 
to Liberal public relations firms in the province. 
Compounding their difficulties in overcoming the sponsorship 
scandals, the selection of Jean Lapierre as Prime Minister 
Martin\'s election lieutenant in Quebec was viewed by many as 
yet another example of Liberal cronyism.  Lapierre, who 
squeaked out a victory in the well-to-do and traditionally 
Liberal Outremont riding of Montreal, reportedly had 
promotional contracts with the tobacco industry and other 
big business interests, even while he served as a journalist 
and host of public affairs television and radio shows. 
 
5. While Lapierre was forced to take a low profile, Duceppe 
campaigned widely and prominently throughout the province, 
projecting confidence  and promotion of Quebec\'s interests. 
Duceppe has been depicted by political cartoonists for years 
as a dour, shower-capped -- a 1997 photo of Duceppe touring 
a Cheese factory wearing a sanitary hat has dogged his 
political career -- single-issue cousin of the provincial 
Parti Quebecois leaders.  However, during the campaign, 
Duceppe overcame his reputation for charmlessness. 
 
Sovereignty Question Re-Opened? 
 
6. PQ Opposition Leader Landry\'s comment in a June 23 Globe 
& Mail interview that a Bloc win could hasten the chances 
for a referendum on Quebec independence was practically the 
only gaffe in the Bloc\'s campaign.  Duceppe, and other Bloc 
candidates, however, maintained a disciplined message that 
this election was not about sovereignty, an issue that can 
only be decided through a provincial referendum.  While 
technically true, it was clear from Duceppe\'s acceptance 
speech and from Posts\' campaign conversations with Bloc 
militants, that sovereignists in the province feel buoyed by 
the Bloc\'s show of strength.  There is already speculation 
that the 56-year-old Duceppe, who hailed Landry as his 
friend and supporter in his victory speech, could succeed 
the 67-year-old PQ leader in the next provincial election. 
 
7. Polling during the campaign did show a higher level of 
support for sovereignty - at 50 percent according to some 
data - than the average level since the 1995 referendum of 
42 percent.  However, analysts note that support for Quebec 
independence follows patterns that have been fairly constant 
over the past decades.  Stronger among the young, weaker 
among the elderly, women and ethnic communities, support for 
sovereignty when a referendum is only a faint prospect years 
away is not taken very seriously, even by voters.  The Parti 
Quebecois would have to regain their mandate in Quebec City 
for a referendum to be held.  Though his government is very 
unpopular right now, Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest 
does not have to call an election until 2007. 
 
Liberal Fortress Montreal Holds, Though Cracks Show 
 
8. Although none of the Montreal-area ministers and MPs lost 
their seats, many experienced their first tension-filled 
election night, with leads seesawing throughout the evening. 
Health Minister Pierre Pettigrew\'s victory in the Papineau 
riding was uncertain until early in the morning; he won by 
only a few hundred votes.  Development Minister Liza Frulla, 
in Jeanne-Le Ber, similarly won by less than 500 votes. 
Those small margins of victory should not prevent the two 
ministers from playing a key role in trying to re-establish 
the Liberal base in Quebec.  Martin is expected to rely as 
well on experienced Quebec MPs Denis Coderre and Stephane 
Dion. But Lapierre\'s election in Outremont may be a hot 
potato for Martin: if appointed to the cabinet, the former 
TV news analyst could remain a lightning rod for the media 
who will hound him about his past. 
 
Bloc Inroads 
 
9. The biggest loss for the Liberals in the Province was 
Heritage Minister Helene Chalifour-Scherrer in the Quebec 
City riding of Louis-Herbert.  She lost to French CBC 
reporter Roger Clavet of the Bloc.  The Bloc swept all 10 
seats in the Quebec City region, with the exception of the 
Beauce riding, where Liberal Claude Drouin barely clung to 
his seat.  He is now the only Liberal MP in eastern Quebec. 
The Liberal\'s star candidate Dennis Dawson in Beauport was 
beaten by Christian Simard, who won twice as many votes. 
The Liberals also lost Georges Farrah in the Iles-de-la- 
Madeleine to Bloquiste Raynald Blais. 
 
10. For the sovereignists to make headway in their 
independence cause, they need to win converts in Quebec\'s 
ethnic communities.  But during a candid conversation with 
Francine Lalonde, the Bloc\'s foreign affairs spokesperson, 
Montreal PAO was told that support for sovereignty among 
ethnic communities was still not very high despite the 
Bloc\'s incessant efforts.  Even among the French-speaking 
Haitian community, support for the Bloc does not reach forty 
percent, said Lalonde.  Lalonde said that for immigrants 
coming from countries where instability meant violence and 
chaos, it is very difficult to dismiss the fear campaign 
federalists mount any time Quebec\'s independence is 
mentioned.  One of the Bloc\'s challenges is to convince 
Haitian and other immigrant groups that they would be better 
off in a sovereign Quebec, than in the Canada that welcomed 
them and gave them a passport.  Still, Lalonde proudly 
introduced us to a Chinese volunteer from her riding, and 
also noted the endorsement of the Bloc by Black Coalition of 
Quebec President Dan Phillip. 
 
11. A quick look at the results shows the Bloc did improve 
its standing in ridings with a large ethnic percentage. 
Outremont, with a non-Francophone population of 50 percent, 
almost voted in a Bloc candidate, but that can partly be 
explained by the unpopularity of Jean Lapierre.  However, in 
St-Leonard (a heavily Italian district), Massimo Pacetti, a 
young Liberal unknown won scandal-tainted Alfonso Gagliano\'s 
old riding by more than 17,000 votes. 
 
12. In his victory speech, Duceppe also proudly hailed the 
victories of Bloc candidates Maka Kotto in St. Lambert and 
Bernard Cleary in Louis-Saint-Laurent. Kotto, an actor 
originally from Cameroon, has appeared on stage and in 
television series in Quebec.  Bernard Cleary, an Innu, is 
the first member of a First Nation to be elected from 
Quebec.  Duceppe, who has disciplined BQ MPs in the past for 
digressions from the party line, may find it more difficult 
to keep these newcomers on message.  Cleary drew rebukes 
from other First Nation chiefs and from Duceppe during the 
campaign when he said that Ottawa should send in the army to 
quell trouble on the Mohawk territory of Kanesatake.  Kotto 
is used to expressing himself freely, as well. 
 
Role of the Bloc In Ottawa Unchanged 
 
13.  Although headlines called the results a triumph for the 
Bloc, leader Duceppe may have preferred a Conservative 
minority with the Bloc holding the balance of power.  With a 
Liberal-NDP coalition, the left-of-center Bloc is still in 
the position of trying to claim credit for any progressive 
measures the government passes while continuing to criticize 
any attempts to centralize power in Ottawa.  The Bloc can be 
expected as well to continue hammering on the subject of 
fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the federal 
government when the House of Commons reopens. 
 
14. If NDP leader Jack Layton is true to his campaign 
rhetoric, and makes proportional representation a top 
priority once the Commons reconvenes, the Bloc might make an 
issue of it.  Though theoretically everyone supports PR, the 
subject is very sensitive in Quebec because it is closely 
related to linguistic divisions; proportional representation 
would give Montreal\'s West Island Anglophones considerable 
power. 
 
15. Comment:  Voter turnout in Quebec was lower than the 
national average at 58.9 percent.  The Liberals may have 
been hurt by voter fatigue in areas where municipal demerger 
referendums were held just last week.  All in all, while the 
Bloc Quebecois has certainly received a new lease on life, 
it would be hard to characterize the Bloc win as a sea 
change in attitudes here toward sovereignty.  As for the 
lifespan of the current minority Liberal government, Bloc 
MPs will not want to impose yet another election campaign on 
Quebecers in the near future  given that their party\'s 
current strength may fail when anger toward the Liberals 
dissipates.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  HYDRO QUEBEC CHANGES COURSE, AFTER SUROIT 
SETBACK 
 
REFERENCE:  MONTREAL 451; CALGARY 547 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Environmental NGOs and community 
activists have drawn sufficient negative attention to 
Hydro Quebec\'s proposal to build the Suroit natural gas 
plant near Montreal that the utility appears to have 
shelved the project.  The provincial legislative 
commission that had been tasked to consider the Suroit 
plant in view of Quebec\'s future energy needs will hold 
hearings in the next several months.  However, Hydro 
Quebec has already changed course, selling off its gas 
assets, promoting energy consumption savings, investing 
in wind power projects, revising its forecasts of 
Quebec\'s energy supply, and above all, counting on 
other big hydro projects, expected to come on line in 
the next decade. Quebec Premier Jean Charest, on recent 
trips to northern Quebec and Boston, has been 
supportive of HQ\'s approach. END SUMMARY. 
 
PUBLIC TRUST IN HYDRO QUEBEC FALTERS 
 
2. For decades, Hydro Quebec (HQ) was a shining symbol 
of Quebec pride in the province\'s economic advancement 
through engineering and business expertise and 
political vision.  But the utility\'s public image began 
declining in the late 1980s following the failure of 
the Great Whale project, a proposed dam project in 
northern Quebec that would have flooded an area almost 
the size of New Jersey on Cree land.  Other factors 
which combined to shake public trust in Hydro Quebec, 
whose sole shareholder is the Quebec government, 
included negative reaction to cheap energy deals given 
to aluminum companies, a series of black outs 
culminating in the 1998 ice storm, and growing 
environmental awareness and activism. 
 
3. HQ said last Spring that its plan to build Le 
Suroit, an 850 MW gas power plant, was necessary in 
order to help bridge a projected provincial energy 
shortage which would be most acute during the 2005-2007 
period but which could resurface any time water levels 
diminish.  But in the wake of a bruising campaign 
against the plant by Greenpeace and other environmental 
and community activists and a fence-sitting report from 
Quebec\'s independent energy regulatory commission, the 
Regie de l\'energie, which deemed the Suroit \"not 
indispensable,\" HQ appears to have shelved the project, 
despite the Regie\'s conclusion that the decision to go 
forward should be the provincial government\'s.  While 
preparing for the provincial legislative commission 
hearings that have been tasked to evaluate the project 
in light of Quebec\'s future energy needs, HQ has 
discreetly embarked on a campaign to regain its public 
standing, and continues to shore up other energy 
capacity building projects. 
 
MOVING TO \"CLEANER\" ENERGIES 
 
4. Coinciding with the release of the Regie report, HQ 
announced last June that it was selling for $C900 
million its 50.4 percent stake in Noverco (an oil and 
gas holding company) to a consortium headed by Quebec\'s 
pension fund manager, the Caisse de depot et placement. 
HQ said that the sale would reduce its involvement in 
energies considered less \"clean\" than hydro, but it 
also enabled the utility to increase income in a year 
when export sales were down. 
 
5. As part of its overall move to \"cleaner\" energy, in 
early October, HQ announced it would be buying 990 MW 
in wind-generated electricity (Calgary reftel). The 
projects, which will generate $1.9 billion in 
investments, will make HQ Canada\'s largest wind power 
purchaser and provide much needed employment in the 
Gaspe peninsula and Magdelen Islands, Quebec\'s poorest 
region.  HQ confirmed to post that the decision to 
locate all the wind farms in Gaspe was political.  The 
Gaspe\'s economy has been almost completely resource- 
based but fish catches, forests and mines have all been 
depleted. 
 
BACKING ENERGY EFFICIENCIES 
 
6. Also in October, HQ announced an energy efficiency 
plan, which still has to be approved by the Regie, 
containing $1 billion in energy efficiency investments. 
HQ estimates that the new plan, to be announced in 
detail in mid-November, will save 3 TWh of energy by 
2010.  President Andre Caille said HQ intends to 
continuing asking for rate increases of two to three 
percent a year, raising over time the price that 
Quebecers pay for their energy.  The energy efficiency 
plan will include rebates for home renovations and 
purchase of certain energy-saving appliances. 
 
REVISION OF PROJECTED ENERGY NEEDS 
 
7.  The wind power contracts and the plan to achieve 
increased energy efficiencies enabled HQ to adjust its 
August 2003 Electricity Supply projections.  On 
November 1, HQ announced the adjustment, acknowledging 
that industrial demand for energy has also declined. 
HQ was able to recuperate up to 175 MW over the next 25 
years, thanks to Premier Charest\'s decision to renege 
on the promise made by his predecessor to help Alcoa 
expand its Baie-Comeau plant.  One other factor 
contributing to the utility\'s adjustment of supply 
projections was the record rainfall in northern Quebec 
during the summer that replenished water levels in HQ 
reservoirs to unprecedented levels.  HQ evaluated its 
new capacity gains at 0.7 TWh for wind power, 1.5 TWH 
for energy savings and 2.9 TWh for reduced industrial 
demands. 
 
CLEARING THE ROAD FOR MORE HYDRO PROJECTS 
 
8. Hydro General Manager for Communications and 
Environment Pierre-Luc Desgagnes told post that HQ is 
hoping its recent decisions will clear the road for the 
next series of big hydro projects, such as the 1500 MW 
La Romaine Complex on Quebec\'s Lower North Shore 
region, construction for which could start in 2008 if 
government authorizations are granted according to 
plan.  HQ is hoping those authorizations will be 
facilitated by the upcoming parliamentary commission. 
 
9.  NGOs are already gearing up for battle, however, 
maintaining that the consensus established by the last 
parliamentary commission in 1995-96 should be 
maintained.  That commission, held in the wake of the 
Great Whale project fiasco, was in large part 
responsible for a decade during which HQ\'s dam builders 
(so-called castors in French or beavers) were kept 
idle.  On October 26, the Coalition Quebec-Vert-Kyoto 
(CQVK) an umbrella group of 60 NGOs, held a press 
conference during which it asked the Charest government 
to impose a moratorium on all thermal power plants 
(including co-generation), oil and gas exploration or 
pipeline building, and the building of an LNG port 
anywhere along the Gulf of St-Lawrence. 
 
PREMIER CHAREST\'S ENERGY VISION 
 
10. On October 29, Premier Charest flew for the first 
time to northern Quebec, where he participated in an HQ- 
organized commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the 
La Grande 2 dam complex, in its day the largest 
hydropower development in the world.  Charest praised 
the foresight of his Liberal parti predecessor Robert 
Bourassa, after whom the complex is named, for 
supporting and promoting the development of hydropower 
in Quebec.  A week later in Boston, Charest was again 
quoting Bourassa and affirming his own will to make 
northern Quebec the spearhead of Quebec electricity 
exports to the U.S.  According to press accounts, 
before a group of 300 energy specialists at the U.S.- 
Canada Energy Trade and Technology Conference, Charest 
said that \"in the short term, Quebec faces restrained 
supplies until 2007,\" but that in 2008-2009, when a 
series of dam projects are expected to start coming on 
line, Quebec will be in a much better position to 
export.  Charest also met with Massachusetts Governor 
Mitt Romney, with whom he reportedly discussed both 
border and energy security issues. 
 
11. Charest told the energy conference that 
diversification is becoming essential but \"that 
hydroelectricity will always be our first choice.\" 
According to La Presse, Charest also affirmed that his 
government\'s priority is the Quebec market and keeping 
electricity prices, which he said are \"300 percent less 
in Quebec than in the State of New York,\" as low as 
possible. 
 
12. Comment:  Opinions differ at the upper echelons of 
HQ on whether or not the Quebec public is ready to 
accept new large-scale hydro projects.  Recent rate 
hikes may temper public receptiveness to environmental 
activism against non-wind, non-solar capacity building 
projects.  But the final decision on whether to build 
more hydro projects will rest with the provincial 
government.  Charest has been supportive of big hydro 
development in his remarks to audiences in Boston and 
in northern Quebec but he will need to support HQ\'s 
agenda closer to home if the utility is going to put 
its beavers back to work.  End Comment.

FOR IO, EUR and L (JGergin) 
FROM US MISSION TO ICAO 
 
E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: AORC, EAIR, EU, ICAO 
SUBJECT:   EU Additionality at ICAO:  EC Efforts to obtain 
Observer Status 
 
1.  (U) Summary and action request.  As Department is aware, 
for some time the European Union has been talking with high 
level officials of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization about its desire to have an enhanced and 
permanent presence at ICAO.  Of 36 current Council members, 
8 are from Europe.  ICAO Council President Assad Kotaite has 
told US Permanent Representative Ambassador Stimpson that 
Rule 33 of the Council\'s Rules of Procedure would permit the 
Council to invite the EC to observe and participate in 
Council meetings on a regular basis when issues are 
discussed over which the EC has competence.  When asked, US 
Mission has explained US policy against EU additionality. 
Mission reading of Council Rules raises a number of 
questions and Post requests guidance from L per para 11 
below.   Kotaite also said that the Air Navigation 
Commission\'s Rules of Procedure would permit similar 
participation. 
 
2.  (SBU) US Mission has obtained a copy of a letter from 
Kotaite to EC Vice-President Loyola de Palacio containing 
his interpretation of Council and Commission rules.  The 
letter states that there would be \"no legal obstacle for a 
delegation of the Commission to ICAO to be established in 
Montreal to represent the interests of the EC.\"  Text of 
letter is contained in para 13 below.   EC tried to obtain 
diplomatic status through its bilateral mission in Ottawa 
and was turned down.  Meanwhile, the EC continues to look 
for office space at ICAO, and, we understand, hopes to have 
its presence at ICAO established by early Spring. Canadian 
PermRep\'s personal belief is that some of the Rules of 
Procedure, which were written by Kotaite and increase his 
powers, including the right to invite observers to Council, 
are inconsistent with the Chicago Convention and should 
undergo review.  The Canadian outlined his personal three- 
point strategy.  He recommends high-level bilateral 
(US/Canada) discussions in the near future, and a strong and 
immediate response in opposition should Kotaite 
\"accommodate\" the EC in a way that bypasses Council 
approval.  End summary and action request. 
 
3.  (SBU) ICAO Council President Assad Kotaite called on 
Amb. Stimpson on Nov. 3.  Among other things, the two 
discussed the EC\'s request for a more active role at ICAO 
through permanent observer status (with the right to speak). 
 
4.  (U) Background.  The Chicago Convention does not provide 
for \"Observer\" status. The Council\'s Rules of Procedure -- 
which were written by Council President Kotaite -- allow the 
Council to invite observers on matters of interest to them. 
Kotaite has a list of organizations from which he chooses to 
send invitations as he feels appropriate (Council members 
sometimes suggest additional observers from Kotaite\'s list 
for a particular meeting, but getting new entities on that 
list has proven difficult.)  In addition, anyone from the 
public may observe a Council meeting so long as the meeting 
has not been declared \"closed\" due to the sensitive nature 
of the issue under discussion.  End background. 
 
5.  (U) Kotaite told Ambassador Stimpson that Rule 33 (Rules 
of Procedure for the Council, Doc 7559/6, Sixth Edition, 
1999) would allow the EU to be represented at and 
participate in Council meetings when issues over which it 
has competence are discussed.  The Ambassador reiterated the 
US\'s strong opposition to EU additionality at ICAO. 
 
6.   (SBU) Alternate US Rep met with Canadian Permanent 
Representative, Ambassador Alain Dupuis on Nov. 9.   Dupuis 
said that the EC had been actively seeking representation at 
ICAO, while President Kotaite had been actively pursuing a 
means to accommodate them.  When he (Dupuis) was Deputy 
Chief of Protocol, the EC had approached him with the 
proposal that it use its bilateral agreement with Canada as 
the basis for obtaining diplomatic status for an EC 
representative to ICAO.  Dupuis responded that under that 
scenario, the EC would have to put its representative in 
Ottawa where s/he would work primarily on bilateral issues, 
and would have to drive on a daily basis to Montreal to 
observe (but not speak at) Council meetings. Otherwise, the 
EC rep would have to be accredited under the ICAO-GOC Host 
Country Agreement.  At the September 2004 Assembly, 
spokesperson on EC Participation in ICAO Ludolf van Hasselt 
said that he was looking for property in Montreal.  Dupuis 
told him he should clear up the bilateral vs. host country 
agreement matters before the EC buys anything to set up an 
office. 
7.  (SBU)  Stressing that the GOC had not yet formulated its 
strategy to deal with potential EC additionality at ICAO, 
Dupuis outlined his own thoughts for a three step approach. 
First there would need to be an EU-wide decision with 
agreement from all member states on EC representation 
throughout the UN system.  Once that decision is 
communicated to ICAO\'s Secretary General, the second step 
would be Council discussion of the EC\'s request, where 
Canada would speak as a Council member (as opposed to Host 
Country).  The Council could refer the matter to the Legal 
Committee for review, which \"could take years.\"   Once the 
Council approves the request, it would instruct the 
Government of Canada to accredit the EC under the Host 
Country Agreement (which Canada would \"rubber stamp.\"). 
Dupuis said it was important to delay Council approval at 
least until after the next Assembly (September 2007). 
Dupuis stressed that while we would likely have a number of 
allies from the developing world and perhaps could even 
enlist one or more large EU member countries, one had to be 
extremely careful in how this was handled.  For example, 
developing countries might see the logic of having the EC 
represented at the Air Transport Committee, and once the EC 
is \"in,\" might side with the Europeans on strengthening 
ICAO\'s air transport functions at the expense of safety and 
security.  Ottawa, he said, wants to be sure that all 
potential ramifications are examined, not only for ICAO but 
for the entire UN system. 
 
8.  (SBU)  When asked about the President\'s possible use of 
the Rules of Procedure (ROP)  to  \"accommodate\" the EC and 
circumvent Council debate, Dupuis said that the Council had 
long been acting beyond the authority granted to it in the 
Chicago Convention.  The ROP, written by Kotaite and which 
grant him tremendous powers, need review.  A general review 
could be conducted at any time; but a review targeted at the 
EC should come only after EC observer status has been 
brought to the Council for discussion. 
 
9. (U) US Mission\'s reading of the Council\'s Rules of 
Procedure raises questions.  Rules 32 and 33 deal with 
Observers.  Rule 32, which would not apply to the EC, three 
times explicitly authorizes \"participation\" by certain 
observers.  It states,  \"Any Contracting State may 
participate without a vote in the consideration by the 
Council and by its Committees and Commissions of any 
question which especially affects its interests (Article 53 
of the Convention).  The President may invite such 
participation where he considers that the condition of 
special interest is fulfilled.  If a contracting State 
requests permission to participate on the grounds of special 
interest, the President may approve the request if he finds 
that the condition of special interest is fulfilled; 
otherwise, he shall refer the request to the Council for 
final decision.\" 
 
10.  (U) In stark contrast, Rule 33, which could apply to 
the EC, is silent on the right to participate.  It states, 
inter alia, \"a) The Council may invite non-Contracting 
States and international organizations or other bodies to be 
represented at any of its meetings by one or more 
Observers.\"  Nonetheless, the definitions section of the 
Rules of Procedure appears to build in the right of an 
Observer to \"participate\" in Council discussion.  It defines 
Observer as \"a person representing a Contracting State not 
represented on the Council, a non-Contracting State, an 
international organization or other body, designated and 
authorized by his State or organization to participate in 
one or more of the meetings of the Council without the right 
to vote or to move or second motions or amendments, under 
such further conditions as the Council may determine and 
holding credentials as evidence of his appointment.\" 
Comment:  In a body such as the Council, where there are no 
votes (except elections) and most decisions are reached by 
consensus, the right to speak is tantamount to a right to 
vote.  End Comment. 
 
11.   (U) Action Request:  Mission requests Department\'s 
reading of whether Rule 33, as currently written, would 
allow an EC representative to speak at Council and Committee 
meetings. 
 
12. (U) Regarding the Air Navigation Commission, its rules 
permit interested non-members to attend.  Some, such as 
IFALPA (the international pilot\'s union), actually have an 
assigned seat at the table.  The number of \"observers\" 
continues to grow, and, given the size of the room, may need 
to be limited in the future.  Increasingly, observers have 
been given the floor to make statements or ask questions, 
which is hampering the effectiveness of the Commission. 
 
13.  (SBU)  Following is  the text of the October 27 letter 
from Kotaite to de Palacio, which the US Mission was given 
in confidence: 
 
I wish to refer to the letter dated 22 April 2004 from Mr. 
Seamus Brennan, Minister for Transport of Ireland, in his 
capacity of President of the Council of the European Union, 
and to the conversations between myself and Mr. Ludolf 
Wihelmy van Hasselt, Representative of the European 
Commission on the subject of a more effective participation 
of the European Community in the work of ICAO. 
 
As you know, the ICAO Council decided in 1989 to include the 
European Community in the list of organizations which may be 
invited to participate in suitable ICAO meetings as 
observer. 
 
The ICAO Council is a permanent body composed of thirty-six 
States elected by the Assembly.  The Council holds 
approximately three sessions per year. 
 
Under Rule 33 of its Rules of Procedures, the Council may 
invite an international organization to be represented at 
any of its meetings by one or more observers.  In addition 
to ad hoc requests from the European Community, should the 
latter desire to send an observer to Council meetings, on a 
regular basis, it could indicate the subjects of interest to 
it among the items included in the work programme of the 
Council for the following session, for decision by the 
Council on representation at such meetings; the Council 
adopts at the end of each session its provisional work 
programme for the next session. 
 
Concerning the Air Navigation Commission, Article 56 of the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation provides that it 
is composed of fifteen members appointed by the Council for 
a period of three years from among persons nominated by 
Contracting States.  Under the applicable Rules of Procedure 
(Doc 8229-AN/876/2), an international organization may be 
invited by the Commission, with the approval of the 
President of the Council, to participate in one or more 
meetings of the Commission. 
 
Certain international organizations which are on the 
aforementioned ICAO list have established resident 
delegation offices in Montreal.  From ICAO standpoint, there 
would be no legal obstacle for a delegation of the 
Commission to ICAO to be established in Montreal to 
represent the interests of the European Community. 
 
I trust that the enhanced cooperation between ICAO and the 
European Community will further contribute to achieving the 
aims and objectives of the Convention on International Civil 
Aviation.  Yours sincerely,    Assad Kotaite  End Text. 
 
14.  (U) US Mission will continue to follow this matter 
closely and will report significant developments.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: CVIS, ELTN, ECON, PBTS, CA 
SUBJECT:  US-VISIT STAKEHOLDERS/MEDIA BRIEFING IN MONTREAL 
 
1. Summary.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) US-VISIT 
Deputy Director Robert Mocny provided two US-VISIT briefings 
on November 5 to stakeholders (shippers, customs brokers, 
Canadian immigration officers) and media, respectively.  All 
attendees were provided a handout: \"Fact Sheet: U.S. Land 
Borders.\"  The briefings went very well, and most attendees 
appeared relieved to have it reiterated that Canadian 
citizens who do not need visas are not yet subject to the 
program.  Post is considering the possibility of holding a 
followup US-VISIT digital videoconference (DVC) with 
stakeholders not included in the November 5 briefings. 
(Notetakers were ConSec Officers Stephen Ashby and Maya 
Harris.)   End summary. 
 
2.  Stakeholders Briefing.  Mr. Mocny described the 
methodology and implementation schedule for the US-VISIT 
program.  He cited four key DHS goals for US-VISIT: 
 
- To enhance security of U.S. citizens and visitors 
- To facilitate legitimate trade and travel 
- To ensure integrity of U.S. immigration system 
- To protect privacy of visitors 
 
Mr. Mocny also detailed to stakeholders the Congressional 
mandates driving the US-VISIT implementation and the methods 
for redressing any errors that visitors may find in US-VISIT 
records pertaining to them. 
 
3. Stakeholders\' Briefing: Questions and Answers. 
 
a. What provisions are being made for exit recording and 
control? 
 
Answer: None will be immediately put into place, but the 
plan is to test radio frequency (RF) checking of \"exit 
receipts\" at 7 trial ports of entry (POE) in June-July 2005. 
Future plans include biometric verification of exiting 
visitors. 
 
b. What about passports that get stolen before biometrics 
are established at a POE for an individual? 
 
Answer: If the perpetrator used the stolen travel document, 
he/she would be biometrically recorded. Subsequently, when 
the legitimate traveler is screened, the traveler would be 
required to prove identity while in the secondary interview 
and the bad guy would be added to the impostor watch-list. 
 
c.  What prevents terrorists from just using Canadian IDs to 
avoid US-VISIT? 
 
Answer: We rely on Canadian officials to safeguard against 
terrorists and other bad guys getting legitimate 
identification (ID).  Inspectors also guard against their 
entry. 
 
d.  Will US-VISIT profile any race or ethnicity? 
 
Answer: No. Everyone, except U.S. and Canadian citizens who 
do not need visas, must be screened. 
 
e. So, Visa Waiver Program folks will undergo US-VISIT, even 
on charters? 
 
Answer: Yes. 
 
f.  Will US-VISIT increase information sharing between U.S. 
and Canadian security and law enforcement? 
 
Answer: Not formally, but all the current information- 
sharing arrangements still apply. 
 
4. Media Briefing.  Media representation included most major 
organizations, such as CBC, The Gazette, TQS, Le Devoir and 
Canadian Press.  US-VISIT Deputy Director Robert Mocny 
provided an overview of the basic elements of the US-VISIT 
Program, outlined the DHS goals in US-VISIT implementation 
and summarized the program\'s applicability for prospective 
visitors. 
 
5. Media Briefing: Questions and Answers. 
 
a.  Why were airports the first to implement US-VISIT? 
(Note. The reporter who posed the question stated that if 
she were a terrorist or anyone else attempting to escape the 
notice of border officials then she would \"definitely 
attempt to enter the U.S. via land.\"  End note.) 
 
Answer: Mocny stated that DHS adhered to deadlines decided 
by the U.S. Congress after the law making body appropriated 
$100 million for the program.  Mocny listed the deadlines, 
beginning with the benchmark December 31, 2003, date to 
launch US-VISIT at all Canadian airport POEs, then the 17 
busiest land POEs by December 31, 2004, followed by all POEs 
by December 31, 2005. 
 
b. How will US-VISIT affect landed immigrants and Canadian 
citizens? 
 
Answer:  Mocny emphasized that US-VISIT will have minimal 
impact on landed immigrants (LI), as they presently already 
report to border officials for secondary interview. 
According to Mocny, the only changes LIs will face are the 
biometric fingerprint scan and facial imaging.  He added 
that pilot programs at the Sarnia and Port Huron POEs have 
shown there is no \"real\" added inconvenience to LIs. 
Further, he stated LIs may even experience fewer delays at 
POEs because US-VISIT eliminates the need for prospective 
U.S. visitors to complete Form I-94. Mocny underscored that 
the pilot programs at Sarnia and Port Huron, and the 
implementation of US-VISIT at Canadian airports, have been 
successful and important to creating a secure medium to 
collect biographic data on potential U.S. visitors (one that 
also guards against identity theft). 
 
c.  How will US-VISIT affect Canadians with dual 
citizenship? 
 
Answer: Dual nationals who declare either their Canadian or 
American citizenship while presenting the appropriate 
corroborating identification at POEs will not be affected by 
US-VISIT.  However, visitors to the U.S. who claim 
citizenship to a third country upon arrival at the POE will 
be subject to US-VISIT and may be expected to take part in a 
secondary interview. 
 
d.  Does DHS have plans to begin fingerprinting and 
photographing Canadian citizens? 
 
Answer:  Mocny stated that DHS understands that in addition 
to securing the border, the cross border economy still has 
to be maintained and that DHS recognizes that most people 
(at least 80%) who cross the US-Canadian border do not have 
malicious intentions.  However, Mocny further stated DHS 
does not believe the border is secure; that the majority of 
people stopped through US-VISIT were taken into secondary 
inspection because of possible intent to overstay their 
visit in the U.S. and that many people with criminal 
convictions have been apprehended through the program.  He 
noted that while presently the only Canadians who must 
participate in US-VISIT are those that require visas (i.e. 
fianc(e)s of American citizens, immigrants, treaty-trade 
investors), the 9/11 Commission made specific 
recommendations on the possible need to include Canadians in 
security measures. 
 
e.  Is it true all Canadians will require a passport to 
enter the U.S. as of December 31?   If not, have discussions 
on the creation of a continental card resumed? 
 
Answer: Mocny stated that DHS has no current plan to require 
Canadians to bear passports at U.S. borders, but that this 
may be subject to change based upon the will of the U.S. 
Congress.  Regarding a continental-wide identification, 
Mocny stated that while that remains an option for the 
future, speculation would not be useful. 
 
f. Will US-VISIT target minorities? 
 
Answer: Mocny stated that the only foreign nationals not 
subject to US-VISIT at POEs are Canadians, a facet of the 
program that will ensure that everyone is treated equally. 
He went on to state while Canadians are exempt from US-VISIT 
at present, only time will tell whether Canadians will 
remain exempt from program participation. 
 
g.  What happens to the biographic data that is collected 
from US-VISIT? 
 
Answer:  Mocny replied that the data collected would be 
distributed within DHS as needed.  He added that an 
inquiring foreign national would have access to the list of 
U.S. governmental entities that has access to their 
information.  Mocny stated there is no plan to share the 
information collected from US-VISIT with Canadian officials 
and that the collection of biographic data through US-VISIT 
has allowed DHS to track the length of visits of foreign 
nationals to the U.S. 
 
h.  Will the implementation of US-VISIT have any impact on 
the American traveler? 
 
Answer: Mocny stated that US-VISIT will have no effect on 
the average American traveler. 
 
i.  Post 9/11--should Canadians get accustomed to the idea 
that they will eventually be subject to programs similar to 
US-VISIT? 
 
Answer: Mocny reaffirmed that the only change in the 
procedural status quo was the launch of US-VISIT at the 17 
busiest land POEs, expected to be fully operational by the 
December 31, 2004, deadline.  He added that while U.S. 
policy may change in the future, he could not speculate on 
those potential changes. 
 
6.  Post is considering the possibility of conducting a 
followup US-VISIT DVC, as we had insufficient lead time to 
notify other stakeholders (ie., representatives from the 
Visa Waiver Program countries\' Consulates General in our 
district, other travel and trade-related contacts) who may 
have benefited from the November 5 briefing.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/2014 
TAGS: ENRG, PTER, PBTS, CA, Terrorism, Energy 
SUBJECT: HYDRO QUEBEC PYLON VANDALIZED 
 
REF: REF: 03 OTTAWA 2558 
 
Classified By: PRINCIPAL OFFICER BERNADETTE M. ALLEN; Reason: 1.4 
 
1. (C) Thierry Vandal, President of Hydro Quebec,s 
Production division, described the recent vandalism at a 
Hydro Quebec pylon about a mile from the U.S. border, near 
Coaticook in Quebec,s Eastern Townships, as the work of 
&amateurs.8  In a 12/7 meeting with the Quebec City Consul 
General, Montreal PAO and FSN Assistant, Vandal noted that 
the perpetrators of the action had placed explosives at the 
base of an electricity transmission line pylon which was one 
of several in a straight line that is part of the 
Radisson-Sandy Point, Massachusetts direct current 
transmission line.  But the explosion caused no noticeable 
break in power transmission, because the line itself was not 
damaged.  Vandal said that a more knowledgable or determined 
actor would have caused much more damage by attacking a 
transmission substation or a more vulnerable part of the 
pylon. 
 
2. (U) The security incident, which is being investigated by 
the provincial Quebec police, the Surete du Quebec, has 
generated some media coverage, particularly after news 
organizations in Quebec and elsewhere received an email claim 
of responsibility (in French) on Saturday evening (12/4) 
signed by a group calling itself &l,Initiative de 
Resistance Internationaliste8 (IRI). 
 
3. (U) An excerpt of the email, which was sent from a Yahoo 
account, published in the media, translates:  This sabotage 
action, that the democratic authorities hid from the 
population during the visit of the Dictator in Chief is our 
response to the ease with which the State mocks the popular 
opposition(. By this operation, we are concretely displaying 
our refusal to be passive witnesses of the waste and pillage 
of resources to profit from the United States empire.  We are 
acting against our gross exploitation by Hydro Quebec for the 
benefit of private enterprises who profit from each 
opportunity that imperialism provides.8 
 
4. (U) In addition to Quebec media outlets, the email 
reportedly was sent to international news organizations 
including the New York Times and al-Jazeera.  The message 
referenced the situations in Iraq, Bolivia, Colombia and the 
Middle East:  &We refuse to allow all the weight of 
resistance to fall on the noble Iraqi people, who are being 
massacred because they were an obstacle to the American 
energy hegemony, or to the Bolivian peasants courageously 
mobilizing against the pillage of their gas resources, even 
risking their lives.  We also refuse to let the Colombian and 
Palestinian people confront the imperial army alone, whether 
or not it is hidden behind a national banner.8 
 
5. (C) Montreal Consulate DHS Senior Agent (MTL/DHS SA) has 
learned from Surete du Quebec contacts and DHS Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement colleagues that a hunter in the area 
had reported the damage to Hydro Quebec, the provincial 
electricity utility on November 28.  The utility had last 
checked the pylon on November 1, according to the SQ.  The 
hunter, apparently concerned that HQ was not taking action, 
placed a second call on December 1, prompting HQ to ask the 
Surete to investigate. 
 
6. (C) At the request of MTL/DHS SA, the Derby Line border 
port of entry Resident Agent in Charge (RAC) walked to the 
damaged pylon (about a mile from the POE) on December 2 and 
encountered SQ officers who were in the process of securing 
the site.  The RAC said that rocks had been used to hold the 
explosives in place around each of the four pylon tower legs; 
the blast apparently caused the central pole to move but not 
fall. 
 
7. (C) MTL/DHS SA has since heard from SQ contacts that the 
perpetrators used 12 sticks of dynamite in the operation.  SQ 
investigators are questioning whether the so-called &IRI8 
group claiming responsibility was actually involved in the 
vandalism.  So far, the SQ has learned that the email was 
sent from a caf on St. Laurent street in Montreal; they 
believe the sender was a young, highly-educated, Francophone, 
female. 
 
8. (C) Vandal said that in response to the incident, HQ has 
raised its security levels to the utility,s equivalent of 
Code Orange.  In consultation with the North American 
Electricity Reliability Council (NERC), presently chaired by 
former HQ Chairman and CEO Richard Drouin, HQ is putting 
special emphasis on the protection of substations.  Vandal 
said that the possibility of several pylons falling 
simultaneously was not particularly worrisome as disruptions 
to service could be quickly resolved.  Pylons located on HQ 
right-of-ways are relatively easy to approach and access. 
Vandal said that an attack on a substation would be a much 
greater cause for concern.

1. (SBU) Summary.  Members of the Haitian Diaspora from 
Canada, the U.S. and Europe assembled December 10-11, 2004, 
to participate in the MCHD.  Canadian Prime Minister (PM) 
Paul Martin emphasized, at the opening of the MCHD plenary 
session, that his administration\'s initiative to invite 
members of the Haitian Diaspora to participate in a 
conference in Montreal, is the first-ever conference of this 
kind that the Government of Canada (GOC) has conducted with 
a diaspora of any kind.  The Canadian Foundation for the 
Americas (FOCAL) served as conference facilitator.  GOC 
officials, upset with a band of persistent pro-Aristide 
supporters protesting outside the conference venue, 
denounced allegations that the GOC is attempting to make 
Haiti a protectorate.  (Note: Government of Quebec (GOQ) 
Premier Jean Charest, reportedly after a rift over the role 
he would play in the event, was conspicuously absent and is 
alleged to have banned his team from attending the full 
slate of the Dec. 11 activities.  End note.)  Prominent 
conference themes included: the need to improve security in 
Haiti in order to move forward with projects (education, 
democratic reform, health, women\'s issues, etc.), the plea 
for the Haitian Diaspora to play a role (ie. provide 
expertise) in reconstructing Haiti and the call for a \"long- 
term\" commitment (in addition to spontaneous humanitarian 
aid) to rebuild Haiti.  PM Martin informed conference 
attendees that his Administration continue work to maintain 
a spotlight on Haiti in \"La Francophonie\".  GOC Ministers 
announced a plan to lead a Haitian Diaspora mission to Haiti 
(possibly in January 2005).  Florida Governor Jeb Bush, 
invited to attend the conference, sent Deputy Chief of Staff 
William W. Large to represent him at the MCHD.  Montreal 
Consul General (CG) Bernadette Allen attended the MCHD as 
observer.  End summary. 
 
(U) Opening Night (Friday, December 10). 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) FOCAL organizers appeared a bit overwhelmed by the 
public response to participate in the MCHD.  Several dozen 
pre-registrants (including Montreal CG) among the 400 \"by 
invitation only\" guests arrived at the venue to find their 
names on the registration list at the check-in table, but no 
credential to enter the conference reception.  We initially 
were asked to wait for credentials to be printed, but were 
ushered into the reception hall an hour later (still without 
credential), just a few minutes before the evening\'s 
reception commenced.  CG learned that a number of persons 
who had not been invited to the conference managed to 
infiltrate the evening\'s event by feigning to be members of 
the media (showing credentials for \"non-existent\" community 
newspapers or radio programs). 
 
3.  (U) A demonstration (about 150 persons) outside the 
venue caught FOCAL organizers and many conference 
participants by surprise.  The daylong snowstorm did not 
deter persistent Haitian-flag bearing, placard holding pro- 
Aristide supporters from chanting, drumming and blowing 
whistles throughout the evening.  From five floors above 
ground level, the non-violent, yet boisterous crowd could be 
heard in the background as speakers took their respective 
turns to welcome conference participants.  Placards were 
inscribed with epithets: \"Death or Aristide\", \"Martin + Bush 
= Accomplices\", and the like. 
 
4.  (SBU) Reception speakers included: GOC Minister of 
International Cooperation Aileen Carroll (Conference Co- 
President), GOC Minister for \"La Francophonie\" Jacques Saada 
(Conference Co-President), Montreal Mayor Gerald Tremblay, 
Quebec Minister of Relations with Citizens and Immigration 
Michelle Courchesne (on behalf of Quebec Premier Jean 
Charest) and Haitian Ambassador for Haitians Living Abroad 
Alix Baptiste.  GOC Foreign Minister Pettigrew, unable to 
attend at the last moment, sent videotaped remarks.  All 
speakers emphasized the critical needs in Haiti, noted the 
devastating floods that Hurricane Jeanne inflicted in areas 
such as Gonaives, praised the response of the Haitian 
community in Canada (notably Quebec) in providing 
spontaneous humanitarian aid to flood victims, highlighted 
the importance of reconciliation and leaving differences 
behind in order to move forward in Haiti, and expressed the 
hope that the conference would result in identifying a cadre 
of professionals committed to long-term work on concrete 
projects to reconstruct Haiti. 
 
(SBU) (Note: Initially billed to address conference 
participants, GOQ Premier Charest was a no-show.  In July 
2004, he and Florida Governor Jeb Bush had highlighted 
interest in a Quebec-Florida mission to Haiti, in a joint 
press conference during the Florida trade mission to Quebec. 
CG learned that Charest, reportedly not pleased with the 
less than prominent role that the GOC had in mind for him at 
the MCHD, pulled out of the event on opening night and is 
alleged to have banned his staff from attending the next 
day\'s slate of activities.  CG was informed that Charest 
arranged a private meeting with Interim Government of Haiti 
(IGOH) Prime Minister Latourtue.  End note.) 
 
(U) Conference Day, Saturday, December 12, 2004 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (U) The conference, which closed two hours later than the 
scheduled 4:00pm closure, was divided into a morning plenary 
session with a slate of speakers and an afternoon of 
workshops.  IGOH PM Latortue stayed to participate in the 
conference luncheon.  (Note: CG, seated at a table adjacent 
to PM Latorture, did speak with Interim PM Latortue to 
reiterate U.S. Government support and convey personal best 
wishes for Haiti.  He appeared genuinely pleased to learn of 
USG presence at the conference.  End note.) 
 
6. (U) The speakers\' for the morning session were: 
a) Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin; 
b) Interim Haitian Prime Minister Gerard Latortue; 
c) GOC Minister of International Cooperation Aileen Carroll 
(Conference Co-President); 
d) GOC Minister for La Francophonie Jacques Saada 
(Conference Co-Pressident); 
e) Special Representative and Chief of the U.N. 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) Ambassador Juan 
Gabriel Valdes; 
f) IGOH Minister of Planning Roland Pierre; 
g) Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) Interim 
Cooperation Framework Director Yves Petillon; and 
h) a panel of seven representatives from Haitian Diaspora 
organizations.  The seven organizations and respective 
representatives, including one each from the U.S. and 
France, were: 
  (1)  Regroupement des Organismes Canado-Haitien Pour Le 
       Developpement (ROCAHD), Mr. Eric Faustin; 
(2)  Point de Ralliement des Femmes D\'Origine Haitienne, Ms. 
Marlene Rateau; 
(3)  Conseil National des Citoyens et Citoyennes d\'Origine 
Haitienne (CONACOH), Mr. Keder Hyppolite; 
(4)  Alliance Gonaivenne de Montreal, Mr. Olthene Tanisma; 
(5)  Federation des Associations Regionales Haitiennes a 
l\'Etranger (FAHRE), Ms. Marie-Carolle Tertulien (in New York 
City); 
(6)  Agence Haitienne pour le Developpement Local (AHDEL), 
Mr. Romel Louis-Jacques (in Paris); and 
(7)  Projet du Premier Congres Mondial de la Diaspora 
Haitienne - Mr. Georges Anglade. 
 
7. (U) Canadian PM Martin, noting that Montreal hosts the 
largest concentration of Haitians (estimated at 125,000) in 
Canada, remarked that Haitians have enriched the Canadian 
mosaic and helped form the unique tie between Canada and 
Haiti.  He emphasized Canadian solidarity with the Haitian 
people, highlighting Canada\'s deployment of a stabilization 
force in March 2004 in response to the security crisis, the 
spontaneous humanitarian support that Canada provided in 
response to the recent floods in Gonaives and Canada\'s role 
in ensuring that Haiti was given prominence at the 
Francophone Summit in Burkina Faso.  He spoke of Canada\'s 
commitment to contribute to the European Union and 
Francophone Summit project that will focus on improving 
Haiti\'s judicial system through training of magistrates and 
modernizing penal procedures.  He stated that Canada will 
join other countries in financing the 2005 elections, will 
work with Hydro Quebec to replicate the success story of the 
Jackmel electrification  project (24/7 electricity) in other 
regions in Haiti and, at the request of IGOH PM Latortue, 
and will consider financing a rail route that would provide 
a second transportation means from Port au Prince to the 
south.  He called for reconciliation and national dialogue 
(to include Lavalas), noting that without securing the 
peace, it would be difficult to move forward with 
reconstruction in Haiti. 
 
8. (U) IGOH PM Latortue, stating that only months ago he was 
a member of the Haitian Diaspora (HD), made a plea for 
members of the HD to help create a new Haiti.  He said the 
HD holds the key to changing the mentality in Haiti, stated 
that it is time to recognize the collective interest above 
individual ambitions and interests.  He congratulated the 
GOC for the conference initiative, noting that while there 
is a large Haitian community in Florida, that never before 
had a meeting of this kind between a government and the 
Haitian diaspora been conducted.  He stated that while 
spontaneous humanitarian aid is not a bad thing, what Haiti 
really needs is a long-term commitment that leads to durable 
solutions.  He spoke of the 2005 elections, emphasizing that 
the leaders in the IGOH have no particular party 
affiliations and that none of the current leaders would seek 
political office in the upcoming election.  He lamented that 
past dictatorships had chased away a middle class with 
expertise that could help build a stong Haitian nation.  He 
urged professionals in the HD to return to Haiti, even if 
only for weeks or a few months to offer services or 
expertise.  He suggested, for example, that Haitians who are 
serving as university professors in places like Yale, 
Oxford, Univ. of Montreal and other places around the world, 
could return to conduct summer seminars for university 
students, if unable or unwilling to leave their current 
professional positions.  He added that HD expertise will be 
needed for the 2005 elections (eg., supervisors, observers), 
for job creation to enhance the economy beyond the close to 
US$1 billion in remittances that the HD sends to family 
members yearly.  Moreover, he suggested that the HD could 
help the economy by spending tourism dollars, such as 
retirees escaping the Canadian winters to summer homes in 
Haiti or youth vacationing in Haiti.  He acknowledged that 
there are security concerns in Haiti, but stated that the 
media distorts the story and that much of the security 
problems are localized.  To further his plea for a return to 
Haiti, he stated that \"Israelis aren\'t afraid to return to 
Israel\", and questioned why Haitians should be afraid to 
return home. 
 
9. (U) MINUSTAH Ambassador Valdes informed the conference 
attendees that MINUSTAH initially lacked adequate troop 
strength to significantly reduce the violence and that 
deployments had been difficult, including workdays with 
16-hour shifts.  He said the security situation has improved 
with the 5000 troops in place and will soon be better when 
the deployment level reaches 6300 troops.  He reported that 
the local police are dedicated, but that it has been 
difficult for them to maintain security because the local 
population has not liked the police and has not had trust in 
the local police force over the years.  He suggested that 
Latin American countries sent troops to Haiti because Latin 
Americans can empathize with Haitians, having shared similar 
experiences in their respective countries\' histories.  When 
asked whether or when MINUSTAH troops will \"disarm the 
thugs\", Valdes responded that \"taking away the arms is the 
easy part, the tough job is building people\'s trust to have 
a dialogue without arms.\"  He added that at some point in 
time, if necessary, MINUSTAH will cut off communication 
between groups that promote violence and intimidate Haitian 
citizens.  When asked how MINUSTAH could aid a women\'s group 
in Montreal that has been having difficulty getting its 
several containers of goods delivered to Gonaives, Valdes 
did not provide a response. 
 
10. (U) The several HD organizations on the panel that 
Canadian Special Advisor on Haiti Denis Coderre moderated 
provided overviews on the types of expertise their 
respective organizations could provide.  Many spoke of the 
possibility of providing professional skills in education, 
health care, nutrition, promoting women\'s rights and human 
rights.  One representative suggested his organization could 
offer a study to ensure the successful coherence of projects 
for long-term success (such as a ten or fifteen year plan). 
Many representatives expressed concern that Haitians in 
Haiti may be resistant to help from the HD.  The PAFHA 
representative said that Haiti is not well-known in France, 
that PAFHA is conducting an educational campaign to generate 
interest in Haiti.  There was consensus that a Haitian 
middle class needs to drive development in Haiti. 
 
11. (U) The afternoon workshops were designed around five 
themes: 
  a)   political governance, 
b)   national dialogue, 
c)   economic governance and institutional development, 
d)   economic revitalization and, 
e)   access to basic services. 
 
Each workshop addressed three questions: 
 (1)  In light of your theme, what role can the diaspora 
      play?; 
(2)  What conditions are needed to achieve a uccessful 
intervetion by the iaspor?; ad 
(3  In the log term, bearing in mind that the Interim 
Cooperation Framework ends in 2006, what are the 
perspectives for a long-term intervention by the HD? 
 
(U)  After each workshop revealed its results, the consensus 
reached in the plenary wrap-up was: 
  a)   that a survey of expertise within the HD is needed; 
b)   that there should be a moratorium on deporting 
criminals presently in Canada and the U.S. to Haiti; 
c)   that the Haitian population in Haiti needs to be 
prepared for the return of the HD, that the IGOH should 
install a \"welcoming organization\", so that the HD is not 
seen by the local population as a band of intruders; 
d)   that the HD needs to respect Haitians in Haiti and not 
return as experts with arrogant attitudes; 
e)   that FOCAL should provide e-mail followups to the MCHD; 
f)   that the Interim Cooperation Framework should be 
inclusive for all the HD groups; 
g)   that there should be continued inter-diaspora 
coordination among Haitian groups in Canada, the U.S. and 
Europe; 
h)   that there should be humble and useful dialogue in the 
development of concrete projects; 
i)   that there should be a creation of a HD Secretariat 
(with financing) or permanent structure where members of the 
HD can continue to send ideas and suggestions; 
j)   that youth should not be excluded or pushed away when 
offering support and services to Haiti; 
k)   that women must be allowed to support reconstruction in 
Haiti; and 
l)   that a long-term commitment (ten, fifteen or twenty 
years) is needed for Haiti, not just a cycle of spontaneous 
responses to humanitarian needs. 
 
 12. (U) In the closing of the conference, Canadian Special 
Advisor to Haiti Denis Coderre and GOC Minister of \"La 
Francophonie\" Jacques Saada, visibly angry about the 
continuous band of boisterous pro-Aristide demonstrators, 
emphasized they were addressing their remarks to the few 
dozen persons who had protested throughout the day.  Coderre 
asked the demonstrators to \"stop the hate\", said it was a 
\"ridiculous lie\" to suggest that the GOC is attempting to 
make Haiti a protectorate.  Saada said he twice tried to 
speak with the demonstrators, but that some hurled insults 
at him and others turned their backs on him.  Saada also 
announced that he and Coderre plan to organize an official 
Haitian Diaspora delegation to Haiti, possibly in January 
2005.
