SUBJECT:  MUSEVENI\'S \"BANNING\" OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY - 
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. 
 
REF:  STATE 76433 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  LOCAL, NAIROBI, AND US MEDIA HAVE CARRIED 
STORIES RECENTLY TO THE EFFECT THAT PRESIDENT MUSEVENI 
HAS BANNED ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  THESE REPORTS APPARENTLY 
STEM FROM OFF HAND REMARKS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT AT A 
MARCH 4 CEREMONY SWEARING IN NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; 
THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH MUSEVENI\'S PREVIOUS STATEMENTS 
DISTAINING PARTISAN POLITICS, AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE A 
LEGAL BANNING, AS WE SEE IT.  MUSEVENI\'S ULTIMATE 
OBJECTIVE REGARDING POLITICAL PARTIES REMAINS UNCLEAR; 
AS INSTITUTIONS THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST BUT ARE DISCOURAGED 
FROM PARTISAN ACTIVITY   END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON TUESDAY MARCH 4 PRESIDENT MUSEVENI BRIEFED UGANDA\'S 
TWENTY-FOUR NEWLY APPOINTED SPECIAL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS 
(SDAS) ON THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  PART OF THE BRIEFING 
CONTAINED REMARKS ON POLITICAL PARTIES.  FOLLOWING IS 
RELEVANT PORTION OF THE OFFICIAL MINISTRY OF INFORMATION 
SYNOPSIS OF MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS. 
 
4.  BEGIN UNCLASSIFIED TEST:  ON A SERIOUS NOTE, MR. MUSEVENI 
SAID THAT IT HAS COME TO HIS NOTICE THAT SOME OF THOSE UGANDANS 
WHO BROUGHT RUIN TO THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ARE BENT TO CAUSE 
TROUBLE AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA.  HE HOWEVER WARNED 
THAT BY DOING SO THEY WILL GIVE THE NRM A WELCOME CHANCE 
TO CRUSH FOREVER WHAT HE CALLED THESE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 
ELEMENTS.  PRESIDENT MUSEVENI POINTED OUT THAT SUCH ELEMENTS 
HAVE ABUSED THE NRM\'S HIGH SENSE OF MAGNAMITY, AND TOTALLY 
MISCONCEIVED ITS GOOD MORAL SENSE FOR WEAKNESS.  THE SDAS 
WERE CALLED UPON TO SEE THAT SUCH APPARENT MISCONCEPTION 
IS ERASED AND THAT SUCH BANKRUPT, AND MISGUIDED POLITICIANS 
ARE EXPOSED AND DENIED GROUND TO NURTURE AGAIN.  MR MUSEVENI 
CAUTIONED THE SDAS NOT TO MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AGAINST 
NRM ALLIES WITHIN THE BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT AND THOSE 
OUTSIDE IT.  HE CHARGED THEM WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE BROAD-BASED GOVERN- 
MENT AND BY ALL MEANS DESIST FROM CAUSING UNWELCOME 
DISRUPTIONS.  ON THE APPARENT PUBLIC MEETINGS AND RALLIES 
BEING OVERTLY OR COVERTLY CONDUCTED BY AGENTS OF THE OLD 
POLITICAL PARTIES, THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THAT VARIOUS 
LEADERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PARTIES SHOULD SUSPEND 
FORTHWITH SUCH MEETINGS AND RALLIES.  THIS DIRECTIVE 
HE SAID HAS IN CONSIDERATION THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION 
AS IT IS OF NOW IN UGANDA AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
MINIMUM POLITICAL PROGRAMME IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD 
MR. MUSEVENI STRESSED THAT THE SUSPENSION OF OVERT OR 
COVERT PARTY MEETINGS AND RALLIES DOES NOT MEAN AT ALL 
THAT POLITICAL PARTIES ARE BANNED BUT IT MERELY SUSPENDS 
POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITIES WHICH AT THE MOMENT WOULD DELAY 
OR COMPLETELY ARREST UGANDA FROM REGAINING STABILITY 
THE ONLY PUBLIC MEETINGS PERMITTED WILL BE THOSE GEARED TO 
ENHANCE NATIONAL UNITY AS ADVOCATED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF 
THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.  HE SAID UGANDANS 
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT NRM WAS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE A POLITICAL 
PARTY BUT A MOVEMENT OF ALL UGANDANS WHO GOT CONCERNED ABOUT 
THEIR MOTHERLAND AND TOOK ACTION TO BRING TO A STOP AND 
CAUSE ABOUT (SIC) CHANGE OF COURSE AWAY FROM THE ROAD 
LEADING TO DESTRUCTION AND DISINTEGRATION BACK TO THE ROAD 
OF STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT.  END UNCLASSIFIED TEXT. 
 
5.  MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS WERE CARRIED ON UGANDA RADIO, AND 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN WIDE PLAY IN LOCAL, NAIROBI, AND U.S. MEDIA 
(FOR LAST SEE \"CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\" SYNOPSIS OF 
REFTEL), ALL EMPHASIZING THE \"BANNING OF POLITICAL ACITIVTY \" 
 
6.  COMMENT:  MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS IN FACT DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER 
THAN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS ON THE ISSUE OF PARTISAN POLITICS 
MUSEVENI HAS MADE NO SECRET THAT HE REGARDS PARTISAN POLITICS 
AS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF ONGOING TURMOIL IN UGANDA BECAUSE 
THE PARTIES ARE BASED, BY HIS LIGHTS, ON ATAVISTIC ETHNIC 
AND RELIGIOUS CLEAVAGES   FOR THIS REASON MUSEVENI WOULD 
LIKE PARTIES TO REMAIN \"DORMANT,\" FOR THE TIME BEING. 
WHAT EXACTLY BEING \"DORMANT\" ENTAILS HAS NOT BEEN SPELLED 
OUT.  UGANDA\'S FOUR PRINCIPAL POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE 
ALL ISSUED STATEMENTS SUPPORTING THE MUSEVENI GOVERNMENT, 
WHILE PRIVATELY EXPRESSING A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE TOWARDS 
THE NRM\'S NON-PARTISAN APPROACH   IT IS CLEAR THAT MUSEVENI 
WOULD LIKE TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES, BUT TO 
DATE HE HAS SHOWN NO INCLINATION TO COERCE THE POPULACE 
INTO ACCEPTING THE NRM\'S IDEOLOGY. 
 
THE SPECIFIC OBJECT OF MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS WAS PROBABLY NOT 
THE LEGAL OPPOSITION, BUT RATHER A SHADOWY GUERILLA 
ORGANIZATION THAT IS BELIEVED, BY THE NRM AT ANY RATE, TO 
HAVE SPRUNG INTO EXISTENCE.  UGANDAN PRESS HAS REPORTED 
THE ARREST OF SOME INDIVIDUALS IN BUSOGA (AREA AROUND JINJA 
TO THE EAST OF KAMPALA) WHO ARE SAID TO BELONG TO AN 
ORGANIZATION CALLED \"FORCE OBOTE BACK AGAIN\" (FOBA). 
GIVEN OBOTE\'S WIDESPREAD UNPOPULARITY, WE FIND IT HARD TO 
BELIEVE ANY CREDIBLE ORGANIZATION WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A 
NAME, BUT MUSEVENI APPARENTLY TAKES THE THREAT SERIOUSLY 
ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE SOME RATHER CRANKY REMARKS TO HIS 
FIELD STAFF ABOUT THE PROBLEM.

TAGS: PREL PINS PNAT PTER PGOV EPET PLO UG WI LY IR XA SX 
SUBJECT:  MUSEVENI AND THE RADICAL MUSLIMS. 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  UGANDA\'S RELATIONS WITH LIBYA CONTINUE TO 
INTENSIFY.  PRESIDENT MUSEVENI HAS MET WITH DELEGATIONS FROM 
THE PLO AND SAHARAN ARAB DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (SADR); GOU 
HAS NORMALIZED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE LATTER 
ORGANIZATIONS.  NRM HAS ALSO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO 
FEELERS FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH IRAN.  THIS RAPPRO- 
CHEMENT WITH RADICAL MUSLIM STATES --AND IT IS A 
RAPPROCHEMENT SINCE MOST ENJOYED GOOD RELATIONS WITH 
THE AMIN GOVERNMENT-- STEMS FROM AN NRM PERCEPTION THAT 
IT WILL ENHANCE ITS ATTRACTIVENESS TO POTENTIAL MUSLIM 
DONORS AND A FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY OF VIEWS ON SELF- 
DETERMINATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND BLACK SOUTH 
AFRICANS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE PACE OF LIBYAN-UGANDAN RELATIONS IS INTENSIFYING. 
IN RECENT MONTHS THE LIBYANS HAVE SENT A TRADE DELEGATION, 
A FINANCIAL TEAM AND MEDICAL TEAM.  GOU HAS ANNOUNCED THAT 
MUSEVENI HAS HELD TALKS WITH A DOCTOR MUKHTAR ALI ON THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SETTING UP A JOINT HOLDING COMPANY TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE UGANDA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.  THE 
GOU HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY 
OF CREATING AN OIL COMPANY IN COOPERATION WITH THE GOL. 
ON JULY 4,THE GOU ACKNOWLEDGED IT WAS RECEIVING DONATED 
DRUGS FROM THE GOL. 
 
4. THE LIBYAN PEOPLES BUREAU HAS EXPANDED IN SIZE 
TO SIX , AND THE STAFF HAVE ADOPTED A HIGHER PROFILE ROLE 
IN KAMPALA.  THE LIBYANS ARE LIKELY TO SOON RAISE RELATIONS 
TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL (SINCE THE 1979 WAR AGAINST AMIN 
THE LIBYAN MISSION HAS BEEN HEADED BY A CHARGE). 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THE HOLDING COMPANY AND OIL COMPANY WILL 
ALLOW THE LIBYANS TO ENLARGE THEIR COMMUNITY, SOMETHING 
THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO DURING THE OBOTE/OKELLO PERIOD. 
THE UGANDANS PROBABLY BELIEVE SINCERELY-- ALBEIT NAIVELY-- 
THAT THEY CAN GENUINELY BENEFIT FROM LIBYAN LARGESSE AND 
STILL RETAIN CONTROL OF THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE OIL COMPANY 
IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AND FITS NICELY WITH NRM ECONO- 
MIC PLANNING.  AS A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY, TOTALLY DEPENDENT 
ON IMPORTED POL, UGANDA HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT 
ITS VULNERABILITY TO BEING CUT OFF FROM POL SUPPLIES. 
TRADITIONALLY THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TO 
TREAT THE PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES VERY WELL BY THIRD WORLD 
STANDARDS.  THEY WERE ALLOWED TO BE PROFITABLE AND INDEPEN- 
DENT IN RETURN FOR GUARANTEEING UGANDA\'S SUPPLY OF POL. 
THE NRM DISTRUSTS THE TRADITIONAL MODUS OPERANDI AND IS 
IDEOLOGICALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS 
VULNERABILITY TO MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM.  THE GOU WOULD 
LIKE LIBYAN ASSISTANCE TO SET UP A GOU CONTROLLED OIL 
COMPANY TO GUARANTEE ITS SECURITY OF SUPPLY, MUCH AS IT 
HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PURCHASING A SHARE OF THE 
MOMBASA REFINERY FROM GOK FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  ACCORDING 
TO AN OIL COMPANY SOURCE IN KAMPALA, THE PROPOSED COMPANY 
IS LIKELY TO BE A PARASTATAL OIL PROCUREMENT COMPANY OF 
THE TYPE COMMON IN AFRICA.  IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
SUCH A COMPANY TO BE PROFITABLE, ACCORDING TO SOURCE, UNLESS 
THE LIBYANS PROVIDE A MASSIVE SUBSIDY EITHER IN THE FORM OF 
ESSENTIALLY FREE OIL, OR MONETARY EQUIVALENT.  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  MUSEVENI HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED A PLO DELEGATION.  THIS 
IS PROBABLY A UNILATERAL INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF PLO TO 
REESTABLISH THE FAVORABLE POSITION IT HELD UNDER THE AMIN 
REGIME WHEN THE PLO OPERATED A FARM AND TRAINING CAMPS IN 
UGANDA.  COMMENT:  THIS IS NOT A SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT. 
FROM DAY ONE OF THE MUSEVENI GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL TREAT WITH NEITHER THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN OR ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS; HIS SYMPATHIES ARE CLEARLY 
WITH THE PALESTINIANS, WHO HE FEELS HAVE BEEN EVICTED FROM 
THEIR HOMELAND BY ISRAELI MILITARY MIGHT.  HE BELIEVES THE 
PLO IS JUSTIFIED IN FIGHTING FOR ITS RIGHTS, BUT FIRMLY 
DRAWS THE LINE AGAINST THE USE OF TERRORIST TACTICS, 
ESPECIALLY ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE 
OF ISRAEL.  HE POINTS WITH PRIDE TO THE FACT HE NEVER RESORTED 
TO TERRORISM DURING HIS FIVE YEAR STRUGGLE.  BY ALLOWING THE 
PLO TO REESTABLISH ITS PRESENCE IN UGANDA, HE SIMPLY REJOINS 
THE RANKS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AFRICAN STATES.  END COMMENT. 
 
7.  MUSEVENI RECENTLY RECEIVED A DELEGATION FROM THE SAHARAN 
ARAB DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (SADR) AND ISSUED A PUBLIC STATE- 
MENT INDICATING THAT HE WOULD ESTABLISH RELATIONS IN 
-ACCORDANCE WITH UGANDA\'S POLICIES OF MAINTAINING GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH ALL FRIENDLY COUNTRIES.  ACCORDING TO AN 
EGYPTIAN SOURCE, THE MEETING RESULTED FROM AN INITIATIVE 
BY THE ALGERIANS.  COMMENT:  THE ACT OF RECOGNIZING 
THE SDAR IS MORE SIGNIFIC?NT THAN EMBRACING THE PLO, AS 
BY SO DOING MUSEVENI HAS TAKEN SIDES ON AN ISSUE WHERE 
THERE I? NO OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS IN AFRICAN AND ARAB 
CIRCLES. END COMMENT 
 
8.  COMMENT AND CONCLUSION: 
 
SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT MUSEVENI\'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH 
THE RADICAL ARABS (AND PERHAPS PERSIANS) ARE IN ORDER. 
 
--  FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND 
LIBERATION ORGANIZATIONS, MUSEVENI\'S EMBRACE REPRESENTS 
THE REESTABLISHMENT OF A FORMER POSITION.  THE PLO AND 
LIBYANS WERE REPRESENTED HERE AND WERE QUITE INFLUENTIAL 
DURING THE AMIN YEARS.  INCIDENTALLY, THEY ARE NOT REMEM- 
BERED FONDLY BY THE BULK OF UGANDANS. 
 
--  MUSEVENI IS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WESTERN DONOR 
RESPONSE TO HIS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE REQUEST OF DOLS 
160 MILLION; TO DATE, LESS THAN DOLS 40 MILLION HAS BEEN 
PLEDGED.  WHILE WE HAVE NO FIRM FIGURES, IF THE LIBYANS ARE 
PLAYING TRUE TO FORM THEY PROBABLY ARE BRANDISHING ABOUT 
RATHER SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS THAT, IF DELIVERED, WOULD MAKE 
THEM THE MOST IMPORTANT BILATERAL DONOR ON THE LOCAL SCENE. 
 
--  THERE IS AN IDEOLOGICAL COMPONENT TO MUSEVENI\'S FAVORING 
THE RADICAL MIDDLE-EASTERNERS; THEY ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING 
TRULY NON-ALIGNED AND NOT DOMINATED BY EITHER WESTERN OR 
EASTERN BLOCS.  THIS MAY BE NONSENSE, BUT THIRD WORLD 
SOLIDARITY IS CLEARLY EMERGING AS A MAJOR THEME OF MUSEVENI\'S 
IDEOLOGY.  MORE IMPORTANTLY THE ARAB\'S SHARE MUSEVENI\'S 
COMMITMENT TO MAJORITY RULE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND HE 
THEIRS OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS. 
 
--  INCIDENTALLY, THE STYLE OF ARAB RELATIONS IS WELL 
SUITED TO THE MUSEVENI REGIME, WHICH IS HIGHLY PERSONAL 
AND CENTERED AROUND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.  TO ARRANGE 
LIBYAN ASSISTANCE MUSEVENI NEED ONLY TELEPHONE THE COLONEL, 
NOT ENGAGE IN THE SLOW PERSUASION AND BUREAUCRATIC CONCENSUS 
BUILDING NECESSARY FOR WESTERN ASSISTANCE. 
 
--  BY HOSTING AN EXPANDING RADICAL ARAB PRESENCE MUSEVENI 
IS INVITING PROBLEMS WITH A HOST OF COUNTRIES WHO HAVE BEEN 
VICTIMS OF LIBYAN-SUPPORTED SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM, 
NOTABLY EGYPT, ZAIRE, KENYA AND THE WESTERN NATIONS.  WHILE 
MUSEVENI HAS SAID HE HAS TOLD THE LIBYANS HE WOULD NOT 
COUNTENANCE EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIONS ON UGANDAN TERRORITY, THE 
LIBYANS INEVITABLY WILL CHEAT AND WILL CREATE PROBLEMS FOR 
MUSEVENI WITH MOBUTU AND MOI. INTERNALLY, LIBYAN SUPPORT 
FOR LOCAL MUSLIM GROUPS WILL CREATE PROBLEMS AS WELL, AND 
WILL WORK AGAINST MUSEVENI\'S EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE SECTARIAN- 
ISM AS A FACTOR IN LOCAL POLITICS. 
 
--  IN SUM, MUSEVENI IS GAMBLING THAT HE CAN STEER AND 
CONTROL THE RELATIONSHIP; THAT HE CAN USE THE RADICALS 
WITHOUT HIMSELF BEING VIOLATED.  THE REAL DANGER TO 
AMERICANS IN UGANDA WILL COME WHEN THE LIKES OF THE LIBYANS 
CONCLUDE THAT THE VALUE OF THE MUSEVENI RELATIONSHIP DOES 
NOT OUTWEIGH THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE LOCALLY AT U.S. 
INTERESTS.

E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS: EAID, PREL, PHUM, US 
SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH MUSEVENI. 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY: 
 
AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED BY PAO MET WITH UGANDAN PRESIDENT 
YOWERI MUSEVENI FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS AT STATE HOUSE ENTEBBE 
JANUARY 15.  THE MAJORITY OF THE MEETING CONCENTRATED ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND NRA USE OF \"3-PIECE TIE\".  AMBASSADOR 
DESCRIBED HIS EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE US TRADERS TO JOIN IN 
BARTER TRADE WITH UGANDA.  MUSEVENI WELCOMED US WILLINGNESS 
TO RESPOND TO RECENT PL-480 REQUEST.  THE PRESIDENT CLAIMED 
THAT DESPITE SOME RECENT SHARP ENGAGEMENTS WITH UNLA 
REMNANTS IN THE NORTH, HE FELT THAT THE SECURITY SITUATION 
IN THE NORTH WAS QUICKLY COMING UNDER CONTROL.  THE 
PROBLEM COULD BE AT AN END WITHIN TWO MONTHS.  THE PRESIDENT 
CASTIGATED THE FOREIGN MINISTRY FOR ITS INEPTITUDE IN 
ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE A VISIT FOR HIM TO THE UNITED STATES 
LAST YEAR, AND ASKED THE AMBASSADOR\'S ASSISTANCE IN PROPERLY 
WORKING OUT A VISIT TO WASHINGTON AND A CALL ON PRESIDENT 
REAGAN THIS FALL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  HUMAN RIGHTS: 
 
THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT UGANDA HAD SUFFERED A \"HANGOVER\" 
FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF THE AMIN AND OBOTE PERIODS 
AND THAT IN RECENT MONTHS THE SPECIAL HUMAN RIGHTS SCRUTINY 
THAT HAD BEEN APPLIED BY THE USG TO THINGS SUCH AS MULTI- 
LATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS TO UGANDA HAD EASED AS A 
RESULT OF THE IMPROVED HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE OF THE NRM 
GOVERNMENT.  THE USG WOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS SITUATION IN UGANDA CLOSELY AND HOPED THAT THE FORMER 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON TREASON 
CHARGES WOULD SOON COME TO TRIAL AND RECEIVE THE FULL 
PROTECTION OF THE LAW DURING THE HEARING OF THEIR CASES.  THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THERE NEED NOT BE ANY FEAR ON THAT SCORE AS 
THE TRIALS WOULD TAKE PLACE SOON.  HE ADDED THAT IF THERE WAS 
NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BRING A PARTICULAR CASE TO TRIAL THE 
INDIVIDUAL CONCERNED WOULD BE RELEASED.  BASED UPON HIS 
MONITORING OF THE INVESTIGATION SO FAR, HE FELT THAT THERE 
WOULD BE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BRING SOME TO TRIAL, WHILE 
OTHERS IN CUSTODY WOULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE. 
 
4.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WAS DISTURBED TO HEAR THAT THE 
NRA WAS USING THE \"3-PIECE TIE\" IN THE NORTH AS A MEANS OF 
EXTRACTING INFORMATION DURING THE INTERROGATION OF PRISONERS. 
MUSEVENI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 3-PIECE TIE WAS BEING USED 
AND WONDERED WHY IT SHOULD CONCERN OUTSIDE OBSERVERS.  THE 
AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT THE INFLICTION OF PAIN TO ELICIT 
INFORMATION FROM A DETAINEE WAS TORTURE AND A VIOLATION OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS, ADDING THAT HE HAD HEARD OF CASES WHERE 
GANGRENE HAD DEVELOPED AND ARMS HAD TO BE AMPUTATED AS A 
RESULT OF THE USE OF THE 3-PIECE TIE.  MUSEVENI PROTESTED 
THAT IF PROPERLY APPLIED THE 3-PIECE TIE SHOULD NOT RESULT 
IN SUCH INJURY.  HE WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT WITHOUT ITS USE 
THE NRA WOULD BE SEVERELY HAMPERED IN BRINGING PEACE TO TESO 
AND SOUTH KARAMOJA WHICH WERE CURRENTLY BEING PLAGUED BY 
ARMED RUSTLERS.  \"I DON\'T LIKE CRUELTY BUT WE MUST HAVE 
TOUGHNESS,\" CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT.  \"THESE PEOPLE ARE 
USED TO A ROUGH LIFE; THEY ARE NOT PUNISHED BY BEING LOCKED 
UP.  IF YOU\'RE NOT TOUGH WITH LAWLESS ELEMENTS, THE LAW 
ABIDING FEAR TO TALK.  IF YOU JUST USE VERBAL INTERROGATION, 
IT WON\'T GET ANYWHERE.\"  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE USE 
OF TORTURE COULD NOT BE RATIONALIZED BY CLAIMS THAT IT WAS 
USED IN THE PURSUIT OF A \"GOOD CAUSE.\"  \"THE 3-PIECE TIE IS 
A FORM OF TORTURE AND CLEARLY A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE WHICH IF 
CONTINUED BY THE NRA WILL SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE FAVORABLE 
HUMAN RIGHTS REPUTATION WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE 
NEW NRM GOVERNMENT.\" 
 
5.  IN RESPONSE TO MUSEVENI\'S REQUEST THAT THE AMBASSADOR 
DEFINE TORTURE THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO 
OBTAIN A PRECISE DEFINITION FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS 
IN WASHINGTON, BUT THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THE 
INFLICTION OF PAIN TO ELICIT INFORMATION WAS CLEARLY TORTURE 
AND A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION.  THE PRESIDENT REJOINED THAT 
HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN HURTING ANYONE BUT SIMPLY WANTED 
TO BRING STABILITY.  THERE WAS A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
UGANDA AND THE WEST.  THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT IF HE 
TRIED TO USE MORE HUMANE METHODS HE WOULD BE SWIMMING 
AGAINST THE TIDE OF POPULAR OPINION.  THE POPULAR VIEW IS 
THAT THIEVES SHOULD BE HURT.  MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THE LEGAL 
MACHINERY IS HOPELESS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE TAKE THE LAW 
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE DID NOT WANT 
TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT IF THE NRA PERSISTED IN THE USE 
OF THE 3-PIECE TIE THE GOVERNMENT\'S CLAIM THAT THEY WERE 
TRULY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS UNPOPULAR REGIMES WOULD HAVE 
A HOLLOW RING. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  MUSEVENI\'S ATTEMPT TO LIGHTLY DISMISS AND 
THEN DEFEND THE USE OF THE 3-PIECE TIE WAS DISAPPOINTING 
AND SOMEWHAT DISTURBING.  BASED ON HIS REACTIONS, I SUSPECT 
THAT OUR INTERVENTION WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD BEEN 
SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED ON IT.  THE EMBASSY WILL BE APPROACHING 
OTHER EMBASSIES AND MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO REINFORCE 
THIS DEMARCHE TO THE PRESIDENT. 
 
7.  BARTER TRADE: 
 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD NOT REVIEW THE OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS 
OF THE BARTER TRADE AS IT ALREADY HAD BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL 
WITH MANY MINISTERS.  HE SIMPLY WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW 
THAT IF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS HELL-BENT ON PURSUING THIS FORM OF 
TRADE, HE WANTED HIM TO KNOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF AMERICAN 
FIRMS ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT MIGHT FIND IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO DEAL WITH THEM 
THAN TO PURSUE SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DEALS 
CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED.  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT ONE 
OF THE FRUSTRATIONS IN TRYING TO ASSIST AMERICAN COMPANIES, 
SUCH AS GENERAL MOTORS, WHO WERE INTERESTED IN GETTING 
INVOLVED IN BARTER TRADE WITH UGANDA WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF 
OBTAINING GOOD INFORMATION ON THE TYPES AND QUANTITIES OF 
COMMODITIES UGANDA COULD MAKE AVAILABLE FOR BARTER.  REFERRING 
TO THE CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID \"THESE FELLOWS ARE NOT SERIOUS\" AND THEN INSTRUCTED HIS 
PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO SEND THE AMBASSADOR THE REQUESTED 
INFORMATION.  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT AN AMERICAN 
BARTER TRADING FIRM, THE IBE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK, WOULD 
BE SIGNING AN AGREEMENT-WITH THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE WHICH 
WOUL? P?OIDE THE FRAMEWORK (E.G., SWING CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS) 
FOR THEM TO TRADE WITH UGANDA.  IBE WOULD BE IN A POSITION 
TO PROVIDE FARM EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT AND THEN TAKE PAYMENT 
IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE TO LIQUIDATE THE DEBT.  THE PRESIDENT 
BEAMED THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DEAL HE WOULD LIKE 
TO FOSTER AND THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR ENCOURAGING 
AMERICAN FIRMS TO CONSIDER BARTERING WITH UGANDA. 
 
8.  U.S. ASSISTANCE: 
 
THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE PL-480 REQUEST RECENTLY RECEIVED 
FROM THE GOU, COMMENTING THAT IT WAS RECEIVING EXPEDITIOUS 
CONSIDERATION IN WASHINGTON.  MUSEVENI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN AN EVOLUTION IN GOVERNMENT THINKING REGARDING 
FOOD AID AND THAT THERE WAS NOW AN APPRECIATION THAT PL-480 
COULD BE IMPORTANT IN MEETING NEAR-TERM FEEDING REQUIREMENTS, 
AS WELL AS IN GENERATING RESOURCES FOR LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT. 
THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT THE EMBASSY WAS FOLLOWING VERY 
CLOSELY GOVERNMENT\'S DIALOGUE WITH THE WORLD BANK AND THE IMF 
ON ECONOMIC POLICY, EMPHASIZING THAT OUR LONGER-TERM 
ASSISTANCE PLANNING WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE 
GOVERNMENT REACHED SOME BASIC DECISIONS ON ECONOMIC POLICY 
(E.G., EXCHANGE RATE ADJUSTMENT).  THE AMBASSADOR SHARED 
WITH MUSEVENI A COPY OF A DRAFT PLANNING CONCEPT PAPER 
PREPARED BY THE AID MISSION STATING THAT WHILE IT HAD NO 
APPROVAL OR STATUS IN WASHINGTON, WE WOULD LIKE TO USE IT 
AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING WITH GOVERNMENT ITS DEVELOPMENT 
OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES, AND HOW THE USG MIGHT BEST ASSIST. 
MUSEVENI SAID HE WOULD READ THE PAPER AND LOOKED FORWARD 
TO OPENING A DIALOGUE ON DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. 
 
9.  SUDAN SITUATION: 
 
THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MUSEVENI\'S ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING IN THE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANY 
USEFUL ROLE WHICH THE USG OR OTHER OUTSIDE PARTIES COULD 
PLAY TO BRING THE PARTIES TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  MUSEVENI 
SAID HE DID NOT HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME BUT THAT 
HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.  HE SAID HE HAD ADVISED GARANG LAST 
YEAR TO TALK SERIOUSLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM.  AS 
FAR AS THE PRESIDENT WAS CONCERNED THE CONFLICT HAD TO BE 
SOLVED POLITICALLY; HE COMMENTED THAT HE THOUGHT THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT WAS PARANOID ABOUT GARANG\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH 
ETHIOPIA.  GARANG WAS NOT IN ADDIS BECAUSE HE SUPPORTS THE 
ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT BUT RATHER BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS ONLY 
SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF SUPPORT.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THE 
SUDANESE HAD MADE TWO FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS: THEY ASSERTED 
THAT THE SUDAN WAS AN ARAB NATION AND AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY. 
 
10.  SITUATION IN THE NORTH: 
 
THE AMBASSADOR ASKED HOW THE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH WAS 
PROGRESSING AND MUSEVENI REPLIED THAT THE NRA\'S RECENT 
OPERATIONS ALONG THE SUDANESE BORDER HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL. 
THE UNLA REMNANTS LACKED A CENTRAL COMMAND, A COHERENT 
STRATEGY, AND POLITICAL PROGRAM.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE 
REBELS HAD TAKEN THE NRA BY SURPRISE WHEN THEY ATTACKED 
LAST AUGUST BUT FELT THAT THE NRA NOW HAD ADEQUATE FORCES 
IN THE NORTH AND WAS IN A POSITION TO \"FINISH THEM IN 
TWO MONTHS.\"  HE OBSERVED THAT THE KEY PROBLEM IN TRYING 
TO PURSUE A NEGOTIATED END TO THE CONFLICT WAS THAT THE NRA 
WAS FACING PEOPLE WHO WERE \"POLITICALLY PRIMITIVE.\"  HE 
CLAIMED THAT EVIDENCE HAD RECENTLY COME TO THE NRA\'S 
ATTENTION THAT THE UNLA FORCES WERE INVOKING WITHCRAFT 
TO ENTHUSE THEIR FORCES.  IT WAS NOT WORKING AND WAS 
LEADING TO THE LOPSIDED CASUALTY FIGURES IN THE NRA\'S 
FAVOR. 
 
11.  MUSEVENI TRIP TO WASHINGTON. 
 
WHEN THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ANY ISSUES 
HE WANTED TO RAISE, MUSEVENI SAID HE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED 
AND ANGERED BY THE POOR ADVICE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
FOREIGN MINISTRY WHEN IT RECOMMENDED HE VISIT WASHINGTON 
LAST YEAR.  THAT SAID, THE PRESIDENT QUICKLY CONTINUED 
THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT WASHINGTON LATER THIS YEAR. 
THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS PLANNING TO 
ATTEND THE COMMONWEALTH MEETING IN CANADA AND WOULD PROBABLY 
ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING THE UNGA.  THOSE TWO EVENTS 
SUGGESTED A GENERAL TIMEFRAME FOR A VISIT TO WASHINGTON 
WHICH THE AMBASSADOR WOULD SO RECOMMEND TO HIS GOVERNMENT. 
THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT ARRANGING A MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AND COMMENTED 
THAT HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED WHEN MUSEVENI DECIDED NOT TO 
TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR, WHEN IT BECAME 
APPARENT THAT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT BE 
POSSIBLE.  A NUMBER OF VERY USEFUL MEETINGS WITH SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION SHORT OF THE PRESIDENT, AND 
KEY FIGURES IN THE CONGRESS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD 
HAVE BEEN ARRANGED.  ASSURING MUSEVENI THAT HE WOULD MAKE 
HIS BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO ARRANGE A CALL ON PRESIDENT 
REAGAN, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT SHOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE, 
A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET OTHER INFLUENTIAL 
PERSONALITIES IS STILL VERY MUCH IN HIS INTEREST. 
 
12.  COMMENT: 
 
MUSEVENI OBVIOUSLY WANTS VERY BADLY TO VISIT WASHINGTON 
AND CALL ON THE PRESIDENT, AND FINDS IT HARD TO BELIEVE 
THAT IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE, ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS 
SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO EUROPE WHERE HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER 
THATCHER, THE QUEEN, THE KING OF THE BELGIANS, THE POPE, 
ETCETERA.  MUSEVENI KNOWS LITTLE OF THE WESTERN WORLD 
AND A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL. 
LET US START NOW TO TRY AND ARRANGE AN OFFICE CALL ON THE 
PRESIDENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HIS TRAVEL TO NORTH AMERICA 
IN THE FALL.

2.  MFA CHIEF OF PROTOCOL GEO DE KINUKA SPELLED OUT 
FOR THE EMBASSY THE DIPLOMATIC STATUS OF THE PLO 
OFFICE IN KAMPALA.  THE PLO ENJOYS THE SAME STATUS AS 
OTHER RECOGNIZED \"LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\" LIKE THE 
AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AND THE PAN AFRICAN CONGRESS. 
THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE IS DESIGNATED AS \"REPRESENTATIVE.\" 
DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES SUCH AS IMPORT OF DUTY-FREE 
VEHICLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS ARE EXTENDED TO THE PLO 
OFFICE BY GOU.  POUCH PRIVILEGES ARE INCLUDED IN THESE 
PRIVILEGES, BUT KINUKA DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PLO OFFICE 
USES A POUCH. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  UGANDA IS UNUSUALLY LIBERAL IN PROVIDING 
DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO ALL CLAIMANTS.  THE WORLD 
BANK, IMF, AND OTHER DONOR ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE THE 
SAME PRIVILEGES AS BILATERAL MISSIONS.  PRACTICALLY 
NO LIMITS EXIST AS TO THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT MAY BE 
IMPORTED BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER LUXURY ITEMS.

REF: STATE 363024 
 
1. THE ABILITY OF THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO REACT IN A 
TIMELY AND/OR EFFECTIVE MANNER IS LIMITED.  TO THE BEST 
OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC AGENCY THAT IS 
SINGULARLY TASKED WITH HANDLING A TERRORISM INCIDENT. 
THE MOST PROBABLE ACTION AGENCY WOULD BE THE INTERNAL 
SECURITY ORGANIZATION ACTING ON APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE 
OF THE PRESIDENT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE NATIONAL 
POLICE AND ITS SPECIAL BRANCH COMPONENT, AS WELL AS THE 
INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL UNDER THE POLICE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL WOULD COOPERATE WITH THE DIRECT ACTION AGENCY 
IN HANDLING THE INCIDENT/S.  THERE PROBABLY IS NO 
MANAGEMENT CRISIS TEAM WITHIN THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO 
MANAGE EITHER A TERRORIST INCIDENT OR HOSTAGE TYPE 
CRISIS. 
 
2. THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) HAS AN 
OFFICE IN KAMPALA WHICH RECENTLY HAS BEEN GIVEN 
DIPLOMATIC STATUS BY THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT.  THE PLO 
MISSION IN KAMPALA ALSO RECENTLY WAS HEADED BY AN 
AMBASSADOR WHO WAS NAMED/DESIGNATED BY PLO LEADER 
ARAFAT.  UGANDA HAS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE PLO AS A 
SEPARATE STATE WITH ARAFAT ENSCONCED AS ITS PRESIDENT. 
UGANDA HAS OFTEN EXPRESSED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PLO AND 
ITS STRUGGLE FOR A HOMELAND. 
 
3. THERE ARE TWO OTHER MISSIONS IN KAMPALA THAT COULD 
BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  THESE INCLUDE THE LIBYAN 
PEOPLE\'S BUREAU (LPB), THE HEAD OF WHOM HAS BEEN 
ELEVATED TO AMBASSADOR STATUS, AS A RESULT OF 
INCREASINGLY WARM RELATIONS BETWEEN UGANDA AND LIBYA. 
DURING RECENT MONTHS, UNIDENTIFIED LIBYAN PERSONNEL 
HAVE CARRIED OUT SURVEILLANCE AGAINST THE U.S. 
MISSION\'S MARINE CONTINGENT BUT SUCH SURVEILLANCE WAS 
DISCONTINUED.  ALSO, THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC 
OF KOREA (DPRK) CONSISTS OF A SMALL DIPLOMATIC MISSION 
WHOSE PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE IN THE PAST IN 
REGARD TO SURVEILLANCE OF US MISSION PERSONNEL. 
RECENTLY, THE SOVIETS HAVE SOUGHT INFORMATION TO 
IDENTIFY SOME NEWLY ARRIVED US MISSION PERSONNEL, 
HOWEVER, THEIR ACTIONS WERE PROBABLY RELATED TO 
FURTHERANCE OF THEIR CI EFFORTS RATHER THAN BEARING ANY 
RELATIONSHIP TO TERRORISM. 
 
4.  THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED THAT 
THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ITS TERRITORY TO BE USED AS A BASE 
FOR INSURGENT GROUPS WHICH ATTACK UGANDA\'S NEIGHBORS OR 
FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
5.  AT PRESENT THE U.S. MISSION DOES NOT HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE OF TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES 
IN UGANDA.  THIS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE FACT 
THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF LIBYANS GIVE RISE TO THE 
POTENTIAL OF A TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE USG AND OUR 
INTERESTS IN UGANDA.

THE FOLLOWING ARE ANSWERS TO PARAGRAPH 5 OF REFTEL: 
 
A.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS IDENTIFIED 5 DOMESTIC GROUPS 
    THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE INVOLVED IN TERRORIST OR 
    REBEL ACTIVITY  THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVEMENT (ALSO 
    KNOWN AS THE HOLY SPIRIT OF ALICE LAKWENA OR HSM), 
    UNITED DEMOCRATIC CHRISTIAN ARMY (UDCA), NINTH 
    OCTOBER MOVEMENT, UGANDA PEOPLES ARMY (UPA) AND 
    UGANDAN PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC CHRISTIAN 
    MOVEMENT/ARMY (UPDCA).  IN FACT THE UPDCA CAME INTO 
    BEING WHEN THE UDCA AND THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVEMENT 
    JOINED TOGETHER.  THE UPDCA IS THE PRINCIPAL NORTHERN 
    REBEL GROUP AND IT IS STILL POPULARLY KNOWN AS 
    THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVEMENT.  THE UPA CARRIES OUT 
    LOW INTENSITY ACTIONS IN EASTERN UGANDA, WHILE THE 
    NINTH OF OCTOBER MOVEMENT WHILE NOT AS ACTIVE AS 
    THE OTHER GROUPS IS STILL MENTIONED FROM TIME TO 
    TIME BY THE NEWS MEDIA.  A FINAL NOTE, THE 
    RUWENZORURU SEPARATIST GROUP LOCATED IN THE WEST 
    CONTINUES AS THE OLDEST REBEL ORGANIZATION IN 
    UGANDA.  WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
    ACTS OF VIOLENCE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS ORGANIZATION. 
 
B.  NO SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE ARISEN IN UGANDA. 
 
- 
C.  THERE ARE NO KNOWN IMPEDIMENTS TO EITHER HOST 
    GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
    TERRORISTS, AND THE ABSENCE OF AN EXTRADITION 
    TREATY/AGREEMENT WITH ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY 
    LIKELY WOULD NOT PREVENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
    AUTHORITIES FROM COMPLYING WITH A THIRD COUNTRY\'S 
    REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF KNOWN TERRORIST. 
    HOST GOVERNMENT MOST LIKELY WOULD PERSIST HOWEVER 
    IN INSTITUTING LEGAL PROCEDURES AGAINST ANY 
    TERRORIST ACT WITHIN UGANDA, AND ESPECIALLY IF IT 
    RESULTED IN ACTUAL LOSS OF LIFE AND OR DESTRUCTION 
    OF PROPERTY/INSTALLATIONS. 
 
D.  HOST GOVERNMENT WOULD INVESTIGATE ANY SUCH 
    TERRORIST ACT THAT TOOK PLACE IN COUNTRY.  THEY 
    WOULD MOST LIKELY COOPERATE WITH THOSE FOREIGN 
    ENTITIES/MISSIONS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM 
    OF SAID ACTS.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROBABLY WOULD 
    PROVIDE ANY REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN CONNECTION 
    WITH INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
E.  NOT KNOWN 
 
F.  POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS: 
    NONE 
 
    DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH RECOGNITION:  AT THE 
    PRESENT TIME CUBA, LIBYA, THE PLO AND NORTH KOREA 
    MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS IN UGANDA.  IN 
    DECEMBER OF 1990 GADHAFI AND ARAFAT PAID STATE 
    VISITS TO THE UGANDAN PRESIDENT.

    ORGANIZATION.

G. HOST GOVERNMENT HAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BROUGHT 
   TO ATTENTION OF LOCAL LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU (LPB) 
   AND DIRECTLY TO LIBYAN LEADER QADHAFI THAT UGANDA 
   WOULD NOT TOLERATE ANY ACTS OF TERRORISM 
   PERPETRATED BY LIBYA AND WOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE 
   ACTIONS AGAINST LIBYANS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH ACTS. 
 
   PRESUMABLY THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS MADE KNOWN ITS 
   DETERMINATION TO OTHER FOREIGN ENTITIES/SUSPECT 
   MISSIONS IN UGANDA THAT IT WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH 
   ACTS.  ANY PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS TO THAT EFFECT 
   ARE NOT KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY THIS GOVERNMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, UG 
SUBJECT: UGANDA: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
1. Kampala\'s submission for the 2003 Annual Terrorism 
Report is keyed to reftel as follows: 
 
A) SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT 
THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES, BUT 
INCLUDING DIPLOMTIC EFFORTS AND ACTIONS TO BLOCK TERROIRST 
ASSETS, ENACT NEW COUNTERTERROISM LAWS, AND RATIFY EXISTING 
TREATIES. 
 
The Ugandan Government stands firmly against terrorism, 
both local and international, and has consistently offered 
cooperation to support the global coalition against 
terrorism. In 2002, the Government enacted the Suppression 
of Terrorism Act, which imposes the death penalty for 
terrorists and potential death penalty for their sponsors 
and supporters. The Act\'s list of terrorist organizations 
currently includes Al Qa\'eda, the Lord\'s Resistance Army 
(LRA), and the Allied Democratic Front (ADF). The GOU 
supports all 12 counterterrorism treaties and conventions 
and responded to UNSC 1373. It is currently working to 
ratify or adhere to those counterterrorism treaties and 
conventions not having force of law.  A new anti-money 
laundering bill is slated to go before Parliament for 
adoption in early 2004. 
 
B) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH 
COUNTRY TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR 
SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2003, 
INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECTIONS RELATING TO 
TERRORISM. PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST OR 
AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
Uganda\'s judiciary had no explicit international terrorism 
cases in 2003. In the past, the ADF and some members of a 
radical faction of the Ugandan Muslim community have been 
accused of terrorist bombings in urban areas. In such 
cases, suspects have been arrested and prosecuted. There 
were no bombings in 2003, although there were many fatal 
attacks by the LRA against civilian targets in northern 
Uganda. There were no incidents of terrorist activity 
directed against or affecting U.S. citizens or interests in 
2003. 
 
C) DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITON OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECTION DURING 
THE YEAR? PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR 
ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
The Government of Uganda did not extradite or request 
extradition of any terrorist suspects during the year. 
There are currently no extradition treaties in effect 
between the United States and Uganda. 
 
D) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECTION AND /OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
The Government of Uganda\'s ability to respond effectively 
to terrorism is hampered by insufficient funding and 
inadequate training of its security forces and judiciary. 
Security organs generally coordinate poorly among 
themselves, although the situation is improving with donor 
assistance. Cases often languish in the judicial system and 
suspects can spend years waiting for trial, despite the 
best efforts of the government to reduce the backlog. There 
is no extradition treaty between the United States and 
Uganda and the lack could hinder effective U.S.-Uganda 
counter terrorism efforts in the future, but discussions 
were continuing between USG and GOU officials at year\'s 
end. 
 
E) DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECTION. 
THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS 
AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE 
COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
The Government of Uganda has consistently condemned 
terrorism, including the 1998 Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam 
Embassy bombings and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. 
Uganda was one of only four sub-Saharan African countries 
to publicly support Coalition actions in Iraq. President 
Museveni regularly condemns attacks which intentionally 
target non-combatants. 
 
F) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 
2003 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA 
 
The Government of Uganda continued \"Operation Iron Fist, an 
offensive launched in March 2002 to destroy the LRA in 
southern Sudan and northern Uganda. The LRA has 
successfully evaded capture and continues to carry out 
reprisals against civilians, even expanding attacks into 
eastern Uganda. At year\'s end, there were an estimated 1.4 
million internally displaced Ugandans, most of whom were 
dependent on humanitarian food assistance.  UN Under- 
Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland 
visited in November 2003.  He called the ongoing conflict 
in northern Uganda the \"greatest humanitarian crisis in the 
world\" that has not come to the attention of the 
international community. 
 
G) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, 
INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC 
SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECGONITION;MISUSE OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT 
TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND /OR PRESENCE OF 
OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR 
TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN 
ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA 
 
The Government of Uganda does not lend support to 
international terrorism or terrorist groups. 
 
H) HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM 
ISSUE? 
 
In 2003, the Government of Uganda made no public statements 
of support of a terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism 
issue. 
 
I) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2002, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD 
TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. WHAT IS RESPONSBIBLE 
FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
There was no change in the Government\'s strong support 
against terrorism in 2003.
