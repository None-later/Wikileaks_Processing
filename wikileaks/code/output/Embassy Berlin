SUMMARY 
/------ 
 
1.  OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW GERMAN STATES ROSE A 
SHARP 27 PERCENT BETWEEN JUNE AND JULY TO A TOTAL OF 
1,068,000, OR ROUGHLY 12.1 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE. 
STILL, THE INCREASE DID NOT FULFILL SOME DIRE PREDICTIONS 
BASED ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE EXPIRATION ON JUNE 30 
OF \"NO-FIRINGS\" PROVISIONS IN KEY LABOR CONTRACTS AND OF 
SEVERANCE PROGRAMS FOR FORMER GDR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.  A 
BROADER UNEMPLOYMENT INDICATOR, NAMELY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
EASTERN GERMAN WORKERS EITHER UNEMPLOYED, WORKING ON A 
\"SHORT-TIME\" BASIS, OR ENROLLED IN GOVERNMENT \"MAKE-WORK\" 
PROGRAMS, REMAINED BASICALLY STABLE AT ONE-THIRD OF THE 
WORKFORCE.  MEANWHILE, THE GAP BETWEEN MALE UNEMPLOYMENT 
(9.8 PERCENT) AND FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT (14.5 PERCENT) 
WIDENED FURTHER.  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, FEDERAL LABOR 
OFFICE HEAD FRANKE, IN A BERLIN PRESS INTERVIEW, SUGGESTED 
THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW STATES COULD REACH 1.5 
MILLION BY YEAR\'S END (OVER 16 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE), 
WITH TOTAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW STATES FALLING FROM THE 
1989 GDR LEVEL OF APPROXIMATELY 9 MILLION TO ABOUT SIX 
MILLION.  END SUMMARY.

EXPECTED SHARP HIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT ... 
/-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  AFTER TWO MONTHS OF ALMOST STABLE UNEMPLOYMENT 
FIGURES, JULY PRODUCED THE EXPECTED SUBSTANTIAL 
END-OF-QUARTER HIKE.  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES FROM 
THE BERLIN OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL LABOR AGENCY (RESPONSIBLE 
FOR COMPILING STATISTICS ON EASTERN BERLIN AND THE FIVE 
NEW STATES), UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM 843,000 (9.5 PERCENT) 
IN JUNE TO 1,069,000 (12.1 PERCENT) IN JULY, AN ABSOLUTE 
INCREASE OF 226,000.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORKERS INVOLVED 
IN \"SHORT-TIME\" WORK PROGRAMS FELL BY 283,000, FROM 
1,909,000 IN JUNE TO 1,615,000 IN JULY.  THE OVERVIEW 
TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND SHORT-TIME WORKER 
STATISTICS FOR MAY THROUGH JULY 1991 (SHORT-TIME WORKER 
FIGURES FOR JULY REPRESENT MID-MONTH LEVELS).

3.  GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN UNEMPLOYMENT BECAME LESS 
DRAMATIC IN JULY.  THE LONG-TIME LEADER OF THE LIST, 
MECKLENBURG-VORPOMMERN, HAD THE SECOND SMALLEST INCREASE 
THIS MONTH (PLUS 2.0 PERCENT) AND WAS REPLACE BY EAST 
BERLIN IN THE NUMBER-ONE POSITION.  EAST BERLIN PROBABLY 
OWED ITS INCREASE OF 18,000 IN UNEMPLOYMENT TO ITS 
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF GDR-ERA GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 
WHO WERE FINALLY TERMINATED AT THE END OF JUNE.  HOWEVER, 
EAST BERLIN MAINTAINED ITS EXTREMELY LOW PERCENTAGE OF

4.  IN JULY, THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TIME WORKERS IN THE NEW 
STATES SHRANK BY A RECORD 283,000.  THE IMPLICIT AMOUNT 
OF UNEMPLOYMENT HIDDEN IN THE SHORT-TIME WORK PROGRAM -- 
I.E., UNEMPLOYMENT CALCULATED USING THE PERCENTAGE OF 
TIME DURING WHICH EMPLOYEES WERE NOT WORKING -- DROPPED 
FROM 1,078,000, (12.3 PERCENT) TO 906,000 (10.3 
PERCENT).  THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TIMERS 
CLEARLY OUTPACED THE INCREASE IN THE RANKS OF THE NEWLY 
JOBLESS IN EVERY STATE.  BRANDENBURG REGISTERED THE BEST 
RATIO:  52,000 WORKERS ENDED SHORT-TIME WORK WITH ONLY 
35,000 ENTERING UNEMPLOYMENT.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORED RETRAINING 
/------------------------------ 
 
9.  THE GOVERNMENT-FINANCED RETRAINING PROGRAM IS 
CERTAINLY AMONG THE MORE MINOR MEASURES AGAINST 
UNEMPLOYMENT BOTH IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND PARTICIPATION. 
HOWEVER, IN THE LONG TERM IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S GOAL OF 
PROVIDING THE UN- AND UNDEREMPLOYED WITH THE SKILLS 
NECESSARY TO COMPETE IN THE CHANGING LABOR MARKET OF THE 
FUTURE.  THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY, WITH THE 
NUMBER OF NEW RETRAINING CONTRACTS RISING FROM 81,000 IN 
JUNE TO 96,000 IN JULY.  GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO FIGURES 
AVAILABLE FOR THE TOTAL OF WORKERS ENROLLED IN RETRAINING 
PROGRAMS AT ANY ONE TIME, IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE 
PROGRESS TOWARD THE OFFICIAL TARGET OF 350,000 
RETRAINEES.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S CURRENT EFFORT IN CREATING 
NEW CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK ORGANIZATIONS 
(ARBEITSFOERDERUNGS- GESELLSCHAFTEN, ABS), DESIGNED TO 
COORDINATE THE CREATION OF ABM AS WELL AS OF RETRAINING

10.  TO OBTAIN A BROADER PICTURE OF THE OVERALL SITUATION 
IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET IN THE NEW STATES, IT IS USEFUL 
TO COMBINE FIGURES FROM THE UNEMPLOYMENT, SHORT-TIME 
WORK, AND ABM STATISTICS, FOLLOWING THE ASSUMPTION THAT 
ABM AND SHORT-TIME WORK ARE SIMPLY TWO MORE FACETS OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT.  ABM IN THE NEW STATES IS A PROGRAM 
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO KEEP THE UNEMPLOYED OFF THE 
DOLE, WHILE SHORT-TIME WORK PROGRAMS KEEP IDLE WORKERS 
WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS EVEN IF THE REASONS FOR THE WORK 
SHORTAGE ARE NOT TEMPORARY BUT STRUCTURAL.  IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MAJORITY OF 
SHORT-TIME WORKERS AND ABM WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAMS RUNS OUT.

MEASURES.  FOR EACH NEW STATE, IT APPEARS THAT TOTAL

SHOWING IMPROVEMENT OVER RECENT MONTHS.

JOB VACANCIES INCREASING 
/----------------------- 
 
12.  FIGURES FROM THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICES\' JOB REFERRAL 
STATISTICS SUGGEST A POSITIVE TREND IN THE LABOR MARKET. 
SINCE FEBRUARY, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF JOB VACANCIES REGISTERED WITH THE LABOR 
OFFICES, WITH THE JULY TOTAL OF 113,100 ALMOST FOUR TIMES 
THE COMPARABLE FEBRUARY OF 29,600.  IN JULY, LABOR 
OFFICES PLACED 95,900 PERSONS IN NEW JOBS, DOUBLE THE MAY 
PLACEMENT RATE.  HOWEVER, AS IN MAY, ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS 
OF THESE NEW POSITIONS WERE IN ABM JOBS (IN JULY, 61,700 
OR 64 PERCENT OF NEW JOB PLACEMENTS WERE IN ABM JOB 
PROGRAMS). 
 
OTHER FACTORS TEMPERING UNEMPLOYMENT 
/----------------------------------- 
 
13.  MEANWHILE, THE WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO SHRINK.  THE 
FEDERAL LABOR OFFICE REPORTED THAT (AS OF JULY) SOME 
549,900 OLDER PERSONS HAD LEFT THE RANKS OF THE WORKING 
POPULATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPECIAL EARLY RETIREMENT 
PROGRAMS FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE OVER 55 YEARS OLD.  THESE 
NUMBERS, IN ADDITION TO THE ROUGHLY 700,000 PERSONS WHO 
HAVE MOVED WESTWARD SINCE 1989, IMPLY AN ACTUAL WORK 
FORCE IN EASTERN GERMANY OF WELL UNDER 8.0 MILLION (THE 
OFFICIAL NUMBER IS STILL 8.87 MILLION).  WE NOTE COMMENTS 
BY FEDERAL LABOR OFFICE CHAIRMAN FRANKE, IN AN INTERVIEW 
IN THE AUGUST 12 EDITION OF \"DER TAGESSPIEGEL,\"

SUGGESTING THAT THE LABOR FORCE WILL HAVE DECLINED TO 
THIS RANGE BY DECEMBER, WITH SOME SIX MILLION PEOPLE 
EMPLOYED AND ANOTHER 1.5 MILLION ON THE JOBLESS ROLLS. 
 
DEMOGRAPHICS: WOMEN MORE LIKELY TO BE JOBLESS 
/-------------------------------------------- 
 
14.  THE JULY HIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT WAS ESPECIALLY HARSH 
ON WOMEN.  WHILE MALE UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM 8.0 TO 9.8 
PERCENT (UP 1.8 PERCENT), FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP 
FROM 11.2 TO 14.5 PERCENT (A JUMP OF 3.3 PERCENT). 
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN IS NOW ALMOST 50 PERCENT HIGHER 
THAN AMONG MEN.  SOME INCIDENTAL MATERIAL FROM THE

EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS INDICATES THAT WOMEN BELOW 25 YEARS 
OF AGE ARE LESS HARD HIT (13 PERCENT ABOVE MALE 
UNEMPLOYMENT) AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN UNEMPLOYMENT 
LEVELS INCREASES WITH AGE. 
 
COMMENT 
/------ 
 
15.  THE JULY UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES WERE PERHAPS MOST 
NOTABLE FOR THE FACT THAT THE INCREASE IN JOBLESSNESS WAS 
LESS THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN:  A RISE OF \"ONLY\" 226,000. 
THIS WAS LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE 770,000 
STILL-EMPLOYED WORKERS REGISTERED WITH THE FEDERAL 
EMPLOYMENT OFFICE FOR JOB REFERRAL, IN THE EXPECTATION, 
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES, OF TERMINATION SOONER OR 
LATER.  WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND EXPIRED SHORT-TIME 
CONTRACTS AND A COMPARABLE NUMBER RELEASED FROM THE 
LONG-TERM SEPARATION PLAN FOR EX-GDR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 
(\"WARTESCHLEIFE\"), THE INCREASE OF UNEMPLOYMENT COULD, IN 
FACT, HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY HIGHER. 
 
16.  IN ADDITION, SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING A SURVEY OF 
BERLIN AND BRANDENBURG COMPANIES, INDICATE THAT THE 
ACTUAL NUMBER OF TERMINATIONS AT THE END OF JUNE WAS 
ABOUT ONE-THIRD LOWER THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  ACCORDING 
TO PRESS ANALYSIS, MANY COMPANIES MAY HAVE DECIDED TO

WAIT FOR THE NEWLY PLANNED CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK 
CORPORATIONS (ARBEITSFOERDERUNGSGESELLSCHAFTEN) TO COME 
INTO THEIR OWN, WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR AN EASIER 
TRANSITION FROM SHORT-TIME WORK TO ABM AND RETRAINING FOR 
LARGE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES.  UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 
THE INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT CAN THEREFORE BE EXPECTED TO 
BE MODEST.  IN HIS \"DER TAGESSPIEGEL\" INTERVIEW, FEDERAL 
LABOR OFFICE CHAIRMAN FRANKE SPOKE OF A 12 PERCENT 
AVERAGE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN 1991 (WITH THE 
IMPLICATION THAT, GIVEN LOWER FIGURES IN THE FIRST HALF 
YEAR, UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WOULD AVERAGE 
OVER 14 PERCENT) WITH JOBLESS TOTALS REACHING 1.5 MILLION 
OR 16.9 PERCENT BY DECEMBER.  STILL, THE EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT COULD BE MATCHED BY A DECREASE 
IN SHORT-TIME WORK, MEANING THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
WORKERS AFFECTED BY UNEMPLOYMENT, SHORT-TIME WORK, OR ABM 
WOULD REMAIN MORE-OR-LESS STABLE.  MUCH DEPENDS ON 
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS ON A POSSIBLE FURTHER EXTENSION OF 
THE REMAINING SHORT-TIME PROGRAMS AND ON PROGRESS MADE BY 
THE CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK CORPORATIONS.  LOOKING TOWARD 
NEXT YEAR, JANUARY TERMINATIONS COULD AGAIN BE 
SUBSTANTIAL, SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE, WITH A GENERAL 
TURN-AROUND IN THE LABOR MARKET NOT EXPECTED BEFORE LATER 
IN 1992, LAGGING SOMEWHAT ANY GENERAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
IN THE NEW STATES.  MILES

SUBJECT: GERMAN REQUEST FOR MILAIR TRANSPORT OF GERMAN 
BORDER POLICE AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL TO BAGHDAD 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Coats.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
1. (SBU) Paragraph 3 below provides an informal translation 
of a diplomatic note from the German Foreign Ministry 
requesting USG agreement for transport of German Border 
Police (BGS) and Diplomats via US military aircraft (MilAir) 
between Ramstein Airbase and Baghdad. The BGS agents will be 
providing security for the German Embassy in Baghdad.  Use of 
commercial air traffic is not optional due to transport of 
required weapons and ammunition.  The Germans propose that 
the first such transport would occur during the week of 
February 14, 2005.  The FRG agrees to pay for the cost of 
transporting personnel, baggage and equipment. 
 
2. (C) There are several good reasons why we should give this 
request serious consideration: 
 
-- The German Federal Border Guards (GSG-9) have a long 
history of close cooperation with the USG.  They provided 
physical security for US military bases in Germany when US 
security forces were deployed to Iraq, thereby freeing 
thousands of US soldiers to conduct other tasks. 
 
-- Most USG flights into Baghdad transit or originate at 
Ramstein airbase in Germany.  An average of 3-5 aircraft 
(C-17s or C-5s, etc.) fly out of Ramstein each week en route 
to Baghdad.  USAFE advises that, given sufficient advance 
notice, it is possible to secure a block of 10-14 seats on 
flights from Ramstein to Baghdad. 
 
-- The Germans will pay for all transport costs.  Although an 
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement cannot be used 
since the personnel involved are not military personnel, an 
arrangement for payment can be established, as outlined in 
the Deputy Defense Secretary\'s Memorandum of December 11, 
2003.  Thus the transport of German personnel would not 
entail an additional uncompensated cost to the USG and could 
in fact be used to offset costs. 
 
-- In addition to the ability to offset USG costs, we would 
dictate when the Germans fly in order to ensure that the 
transport of FRG personnel and equipment does not conflict 
with USG operational requirements. 
 
-- The convoy route previously used between Baghdad and 
Kuwait has been closed.  Weight and security restrictions on 
commercial flights to Baghdad prohibit the transfer of 
weapons and equipment.  The leasing of a commercial aircraft 
solely for this purpose would be prohibitively expensive.  If 
Germany is unable to transport security personnel, ammunition 
and equipment to support its mission in Iraq in a cost 
effective manner there is a risk that they will close their 
Embassy. 
 
-- The loss of additional personnel in a situation similar to 
the April \'04 ambush of a German diplomatic convoy from 
Kuwait to Baghdad, would place increased pressure on the FRG 
to justify their presence in Iraq, an operation that is 
already their most expensive overseas mission fiscally and 
one that is not popular domestically. 
 
-- It is in our interest to keep an active German diplomatic 
presence in Iraq.  The presence of a German Embassy is a 
symbolic demonstration of USG progress towards forging a new 
Iraq.  Closure or curtailment of operations of the German 
Embassy would undermine the perception that we are creating a 
more stable and secure Iraq. 
 
-- Even though the FRG has been difficult to work with on 
some issues, the Germans have made and are continuing to make 
significant indirect contributions to our efforts in Iraq by 
providing over-flight rights, unhindered use of our military 
facilities, base security and significant support for GWOT 
actions outside of Iraq.  Without FRG cooperation and 
contributions our operations in Iraq would be greatly 
impaired. 
 
-- The FRG is also supporting our efforts in Iraq by training 
Iraqi police and military personnel in UAE. The FRG is 
considering participating in a proposed EU police-training 
mission.  In addition, the FRG agreed to allow the NATO 
training mission in Iraq, although they have chosen not to 
participate. 
 
-- If we grant the request, it will symbolize a renewed 
spirit of cooperation.  Given that the first transport has 
been requested for the week of February 14, just before the 
Bush-Schroeder Summit on February 23, the agreement could be 
presented as a simple, painless and cost free \"deliverable\" 
at the upcoming Summit and would offer a far greater return 
than any resulting inconvenience. 
 
3.(SBU) Unofficial Translation: 
 
Foreign Office 
GZ: 301-320.21 IRQ 
 
Verbal Note 
 
The Foreign Office has the honor to submit to the Embassy of 
the United States of America the following request: 
 
The Foreign Office refers to the circular note of the Iraqi 
Foreign Ministry from June 11, 2003 to foreign missions, in 
which it stated \"that the Coalition Provisional Authority has 
announced that members of Foreign Liaison Offices in Iraq 
enter and remain in Iraq at their own risk.  The Coalition 
Provisional Authority cannot,(, guarantee the safety or 
security of a foreign liaison mission or its personnel.\"  At 
the same time, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry pointed out in its 
circular note that \"Foreign liaison officials may bring into 
Iraq and/or maintain their own security forces(\". 
 
Notwithstanding the basic position regarding the status of 
foreign missions in Iraq, the Federal Government carries out 
its own security measures in Baghdad as well as upon entry 
and departure.  Members of the Federal Border Police have 
been protecting the real estate of the German Embassy in 
Baghdad and the German diplomats working there. 
 
The diplomatic personnel of the German Embassy in Baghdad, 
including the officers of the Federal Border Police, 
currently use civil airlines for entry to and departure from 
Baghdad.  Due to the security provisions required by the 
airlines, it is not possible to take along excess baggage, 
and, in particular, weapons and ammunition.  Therefore, in 
light of the above-described position of the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry, the Federal Government cannot sufficiently provide 
adequate security measures. 
 
Recent developments in the security situation in Iraq have 
increased the risks for the employees of the German Embassy 
in Baghdad.  Without optimal security measures, the long-term 
presence of the German Embassy in Baghdad would be put into 
question. 
 
Therefore the Federal Government requests the Embassy of the 
United States of America and responsible U.S. Government 
Ministries or Agencies to permit United States Air Force 
transport of security personnel assigned to the German 
Embassy in Baghdad on military aircraft flights from Ramstein 
to Baghdad. 
 
The Federal Border Police rotates its security personnel at 
the German Embassy in Baghdad every three months.  The next 
rotations will take place in February and May 2005, 
respectively.  The rotation will be organized in two 
contingents of five officers each.  Due to the required 
transfer of tasks on site, the timeframe for each rotation 
phase takes up to two weeks.  The following schedule is 
planned for the personnel rotation in February 2005: 
Departure of five officers from Germany in the 7th calendar 
week (as of February 14, 2005), about a week later (as of 
February 21, 2005) another five officers should depart, and 
on the same day, five other officers should return to 
Germany.  A week later (as of February 28, 2005), a return 
flight for the remaining five officers should be scheduled. 
The personnel exchange would then be completed. 
 
The officers are taking along baggage with a total weight of 
150 kg per person.  This includes command and control and 
operational equipment (including weapons and ammunition). 
 
The Foreign Office proposes that prior to each planned 
personnel exchange, Referat 107 of the Foreign Office will 
inform the Embassy of the United States of America, or 
another entity to be named by the Embassy of the United 
States of America, about all details of the planned exchange. 
 The Foreign Office would appreciate receiving information on 
points of contact, on the - from your perspective - required 
time of notification for each request from the Foreign 
Office, and on any further details that may be required from 
the Foreign Office. 
 
In addition to the officers, exchange, transportation of 
unaccompanied command and control equipment would be 
appreciated in individual cases, for example, if essential 
equipment fails, provided that it can,t wait until the next 
rotation of personnel. 
 
As a matter of course, the Foreign Office is willing to pay 
the transportation costs of the officers and the baggage. 
 
      In light of the situation in Iraq the Foreign Office 
would appreciate a swift response. 
 
      The Foreign Office avails itself of this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy of the United States of America the 
assurances of its highest consideration.

SUPPORTS GOALS ON AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: STATE 2743 
 
Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor John K. Bauman; 
Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) In response to reftel demarche, on January 6 MFA 
Deputy NATO director Herbert Beck assured Embassy that 
Germany will continue to push other NATO allies increase 
their contributions to ISAF. When asked if he thought Germany 
would be able to persuade the Spaniards to provide a PRT in 
Qala-e Nah or Chaghcharan, Beck replied \"that is a good 
question.\"  Germany has urged the GOS to take over a PRT, but 
thus far they have been noncommital.  He said that the 
success of ISAF remains one of Germany\'s top priorities and 
that Germany raises the issue with allies at every 
opportunity. 
 
2. (C) Beck said that Germany did not have a specific plan in 
mind for how it could help with the Parliamentary elections. 
He noted that when Turkey takes over the ISAF lead from 
EUROCORPS in February, Germany will have a larger cushion 
between deployed forces and the parliamentary-imposed ceiling 
of 2,250.  Although Germany had originally thought that its 
NRF-IV forces would be deployed to support the Parliamentary 
elections, the French would prefer to keep NRF-IV troops on 
standby for other missions.  Instead he expected that the 
German contribution for election support will be determined 
by the upcoming force generation process. 
 
Kabul minimize considered.
