EMBASSY HAS LITTLE NEW RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR 
SUBJECT REPORT.  THE PLO MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN 
MONGOLIA, BUT AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, MIDDLE EAST 
ISSUES AND THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM WORLDWIDE RECEIVE 
SCANT ATTENTION HERE.  THERE WERE NO INSTANCES OF 
TERRORISM IN MONGOLIA OR ANY TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN 
WHICH MONGOLIA IS ACCUSED OF BEING INVOLVED DURING THE 
PAST YEAR.  ANY CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE 
TOWARD TERRORISM, IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE, WOULD 
PROBABLY BE POSITIVE, GIVEN THE DEMOCRATIZATION THAT 
IS TAKING PLACE IN THE NATION AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO 
FORGE CLOSER TIES WITH THE INDUSTRIALIZED AND 
NON-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES OF NORTH AMERICA, ASIA, AND 
EUROPE.  MONGOLIAN STATEMENTS ON EAST-WEST AND 
NORTH-SOUTH ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA HAVE A 
NOTICEABLY MILDER TONE THAN IN THE PAST.

SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR MONGOLIA 
 
REF: STATE 338430 
 
1. FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN 
REFTEL, PARA FIVE. 
 
2. A) MONGOLIA HAS EXPERIENCED NO REPORTED ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND IS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY PROSECUTION 
OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
B) EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS FROM MONGOLIA 
OR REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION TO MONGOLIA FOR TERRORIST 
OFFENSES. 
 
C) MONGOLIA HAS EXPERIENCED NO TERRORIST ACTS IN ITS 
RECENT HISTORY. THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
IMPAIRMENTS TO EFFECTIVE MONGOLIAN PROSECUTION OF ACCUSED 
TERRORISTS.  HOWEVER, MONGOLIA HAS EXTRADITION TREATIES 
WITH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, MOSTLY FORMER 
EUROPEAN COMMUNIST STATES.  IN SOME CASES, THE GOM 
CONSIDERS THAT THESE TREATIES HAVE LAPSED WITH THE CHANGE 
IN GOVERNMENT IN THE OTHER SIGNATORY STATE BUT IS SEEKING 
TO RENEW THEM. 
 
D) MONGOLIA HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OR 
PROSECUTION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST CASES.  THE GOM 
CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND HAS PUBLICLY 
DENOUNCED MAJOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS. 
 
E) EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY MONGOLIAN COUNTERTERRORISM 
ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN IN 1992. 
 
F) THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MONGOLIAN GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ANY KIND.  CHINESE 
SOURCES HAVE CRITICIZED THE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT OF 
PRIVATE MONGOLIAN CITIZENS AND GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF INNER 
MONGOLIAN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE FROM CHINESE 
RULE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MONGOLIA HAS 
SERVED AS A BASE FOR ANY VIOLENT ACTS AGAINST CHINESE 
RULE. 
 
G. MONGOLIA MAINTAINS EMBASSIES IN NORTH KOREA AND CUBA; 
BOTH OF THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE EMBASSIES IN ULAANBAATAR. 
DURING 1992, THE GOM PERIODICALLY EXCHANGED 
CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES ON NATIONAL OCCASIONS WITH BOTH 
REGIMES BUT DID NOT EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE POLICIES OR 
POSITIONS OF EITHER GOVERNMENT. MONGOLIA HAS DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH SYRIA, IRAN, IRAQ AND LIBYA BUT MAINTAINS 
NO RESIDENT EMBASSIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES NOR ARE THEY 
REPRESENTED IN MONGOLIA. MONGOLIA HAS NOT EXPRESSED 
SUPPORT FOR THE POLICIES OF ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES. 
 
H. NO CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE.  IT REMAINS FIRMLY 
OPPOSED TO TERRORISM FOR ANY PURPOSE AND IN ANY FORM. 
 
I. MONGOLIA HAS NEVER MAINTAINED A DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN 
LIBYA NOR HAVE LIBYAN DIPLOMATS VISITED MONGOLIA IN 1992.

1.  WITH ONE EXCEPTION, POST HAS NO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO REPORT 
FOR THIS YEAR\'S TERRORISM REPORT (REFTEL PARA 3).  MONGOLIA HAS 
NEITHER EXPERIENCED, CONDONED, NOR ENCOURAGED TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST ACTS, WHETHER OF THE DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL VARIETY, 
DURING 1994. 
 
2.  IN REFERENCE TO PARA 3 C) REFTEL:  IF A SUSPECTED INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST WERE IDENTIFIED AND INTERCEPTED WITHIN THE MONGOLIA, 
EXTRADITION COULD/COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.  MONGOLIA AT PRESENT 
REPORTEDLY ONLY RECOGNIZES AS VALID SEVERAL OF THE EXTRADITION 
AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN PAST DECADES WITH ITS THEN-COMECON 
PARTNERS IN EASTERN EUROPE.  SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGES IN 1990, 
IT HAS CONCLUDED NO OTHER FORMAL EXTRADITION TREATIES,  NEITHER 
WITH THE U. S. NOR WITH ANY OTHER MAJOR ALLY. 
 
3.  HAVING SAID THAT, THE MONGOLIAN GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY 
INTERESTED IN EXPANDING COOPERATION WITH INTERPOL AND OTHER LAW

REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (U) ON NOVEMBER 6, WE REVIEWED POINTS CONTAINED IN 
REFTEL WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER S. BATBOLD.  HE STATED 
HE UNDERSTOOD THE GOALS OF THE U. S. POLICY.  HE ADDED THA 
HE APPRECIATED THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND OUR REQUEST FO 
COMMENT BUT WOULD DEFER COMMENT FOR THE MOMENT. 
 
2.  (C) BATBOLD AND A MEMBER OF HIS STAFF POSED QUESTIONS 
ON THREE POINTS: (1) DOES THE POLICY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 
RADICAL AND MODERATE ELEMENTS OF THE TALIBAN?; (2) WILL TH 
NORTHERN ALLIANCE BE WILLING TO SHARE POWER IF IT OCCUPIES 
KABUL BEFORE A COALITION IS ORGANIZED?; AND, (3) IS THE 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, PARTICULARLY THAT BEING AIR- 
DROPPED BY THE U. S., REACHING THE REFUGEES OR IS IT BEING 
INTERCEPTED BY TALIBAN ELEMENTS?  WE WERE ABLE TO RESPOND 
TO THE QUESTIONS DRAWING ON THE POINTS IN REFTEL AND ON TH 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CABLES. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  BATBOLD\'S NON-COMMITTAL RESPONSE IS DUE 
TO THE FACT THAT BOTH THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER ARE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  WE EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF MONGOLIA TO SUPPORT U. S. POLICY IN THIS MATTER.
