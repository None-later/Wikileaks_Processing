1.  SUMMARY:  ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PUNJAB 
STATE ON AUGUST 6 IN CONTINUING SECTARIAN STRIFE. 
DELHI POLICE ARE GEARING UP TO MEET THE EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY BEFORE THE INDEPENDENCE 
DAY CELEBRATIONS ON AUGUST 15.  ACTING JATHEDAR 
DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S CONVENTION, HELD AUGUST 4, 
PROVIDED A FORUM FOR EXTREME AND MODERATE POINTS OF 
VIEW WITH NO OBVIOUS MEETING OF MINDS.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS ELEVEN PEOPLE--NINE OF 
WHOM WERE HINDUS--WERE KILLED IN TERRORIST RELATED 
VIOLENCE IN PUNJAB ON AUGUST 6.  TWO ALLEGED 
TERRORISTS WERE KILLED BY SECURITY FORCES WHO 
RECOVERED A US MADE AUTOMATIC WEAPON FROM ONE OF THE 
BODIES.  ALMOST ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE IN 
AMRITSAR DISTRICT.  A COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA 
ACTIVIST, AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF PARA MEDICAL 
EMPLOYEES, WAS SHOT BY THREE TERRORISTS.  THE KILLERS, 
WHO LEFT A NOTE CLAIMING TO BE FROM THE RANJIT SINGH 
RANA GROUP, ESCAPED ON THE VICTIM\'S SCOOTER. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE HOME MINISTRY 
\"HAS DEFINITE INFORMATION THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE 
PLOTTING DO SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE\" IN THE WEEK 
LEADING UP TO INDEPENDENCE DAY.  OTHER SOURCES REPORT 
THAT THE TERRORISTS WILL PROBABLY STRIKE ON AUGUST 15 
FOR MAXIMUM ALL-INDIA ATTENTION.  DELHI POLICE, 
REELING FROM THEIR FAILURE TO STOP RECENT TERRORIST 
ATTACKS IN THE POSH SOUTH DELHI HOUSING COLONIES, ARE 
STEPPING UP THEIR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL POSSIBLE 
TERRORIST ENTRY TO THE CITY.  ALL ENTRY POINTS TO THE 
CITY ARE NOW GUARDED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE POLICE 
HAVE REPORTEDLY IMPROVED THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. 
THERE APPEARS TO BE NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT 
TERRORISTS WOULD NECESSARILY STRIKE IN DELHI, ALTHOUGH 
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE PUBLICITY THEY DESIRE.  BOTH 
HARYANA AND PUNJAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR 
SECURITY MECHANISMS. 
 
4.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI CONTINUED HIS 
LONE CAMPAIGN FOR A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE 
MILITANTS AND MODERATES WITH A SIKH CONVENTION ON 
AUGUST 4. (SEE REFTEL)  THE CONVENTION WAS A NOISY 
AFFAIR WITH LITTLE CONGRUENCE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE 
MODERATES AND MILITANTS AND AN ABUNDANCE OF RADICALISM 
ON THE PART OF THE MILITANTS.  ALTHOUGH MANY 
PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONVENTION CLEARLY DEMANDED NO 
LESS THAN KHALISTAN, THE CONVENTION RESOLUTION CALLED 
FOR THE SIKHS TO BE GIVEN AN \"AREA AND POLITICAL SETUP 
IN NORTH INDIA WHERE SIKHS CAN EXPERIENCE THE GLOW OF 
FREEDOM.\"  ACCORDING TO RAGI, THE DEMAND WAS A SPINOFF 
FROM AN ASSURANCE GIVEN TO THE SIKHS BY JAWAHARLAL 
NEHRU IN 1946.  EXPANDING ON THE THEME, THE HIGH 
PRIEST EXPLAINED THAT THE PROPOSED \"SET-UP\" WOULD 
RESULT IN GREATER AUTONOMY FOR THE STATE.  A SIKH 
CLAIMING TO REPRESENT SIKHS LIVING OUTSIDE PUNJAB SAID 
THAT SIKH DEMANDS REPRESENTED DEMANDS OF ALL INDIAN 
STATES AND URGED THE HIGH PRIESTS TO START A 
NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED AUTONOMY. 
 
5.  MODERATE SPEAKERS CALLED FOR A NON-VIOLENT 
STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF THE SIKHS AND MOST 
SPEAKERS DEMANDED IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
ANANDAPUR SAHIB RESOLUTION WHICH CALLED FOR GREATER 
AUTONOMY IN THE STATES.  THE MILITANTS, AS WAS 
EXPECTED, DEMANDED THE FORMATION OF KHALISTAN AND 
DECLARED THAT THE GUN WAS THE ONLY ANSWER FOR THE 
SIKHS.  THE MILITANT GROUPS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
BABBAR KHALSA, ALL QUESTIONED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
HIGH PRIESTS BUT MADE NO MOVES TO REPLACE THEM.  IN 
RAGI\'S CONCLUDING STATEMENT HE AGREED WITH THE 
MILITANTS THAT THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS 
WITHOUT WEAPONS.   BUT, THE HIGH PRIEST NOTED, WEAPONS 
MUST CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND THE TIMES NO LONGER 
CALLED FOR VIOLENT STRUGGLE.  THE TIME HAD COME, RAGI 
PLEADED, \"FOR UNITY BETWEEN THOSE WHO FAVORED THE GUN 
AND THOSE WHO FAVORED NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.\" 
 
6.  THE CONVENTION WAS ATTENDED BY SOME FIVE HUNDRED 
PARTICIPANTS ALL OF WHOM PASSED THROUGH STRICT POLICE 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE ENTERING THE GOLDEN 
TEMPLE.  MODERATE POLITICIANS, INCLUDING 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AKALI DAL (L), WERE NOT INVITED 
TO ATTEND THE CONVENTION.  PARTICIPANTS DID INCLUDE 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE \"UNIFIED\" AKALI DAL, THE 
BABBAR KHALSA, BOTH THE MANJIT SINGH AND GURJIT SINGH 
FACTIONS OF THE ALL INDIA SIKH STUDENTS FEDERATION, 
THE BHINDRANWALE TIGERS FORCE OF KHALISTAN, THE 
KHALISTAN COMMANDO FORCE, THE KHALISTAN LIBERATION 
FORCE, THE SIKH INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE DALIT 
FRONT.  INDIVIDUALS LAWYERS, INTELLECTUALS AND RETIRED 
MILITARY ALSO ATTENDED. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND THE FLAT 
RESULT OF DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S ATTEMPTS TO FORGE 
MILITANT-MODERATE UNITY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO 
IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON THE SIKH\'S SIDE OF THE PUNJAB 
DILEMMA.  THE SPEECHES AT THE SIKH CONVENTION SHOW THE 
DEEP DIFFERENCES THAT REMAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. 
INDEED, THE FINAL DECLARATION IS AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO 
PAPER OVER THESE DIVISIONS.  DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S 
ATTEMPT WAS WELL RECEIVED BY POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND 
THE HIGH PRIEST REMAINS THE BEST HOPE FOR SOME 
SOLUTION.

SUBJ: INDIAN FRICTION WITH LTTE GROWS 
 
REF: COLOMBO 6523 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. ON SEPTEMBER 24 THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF 
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ISSUED ANOTHER WARNING TO THE LTTE 
THAT IT WILL RESPOND MORE FORCEFULLY IF THE TAMIL 
MILITANT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT STOP HAMPERING THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD.  THE MEA 
SPOKESMAN BLAMED THE LTTE FOR INSTIGATING AND 
ENGINEERING A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION SEPTEMBER 23 
BETWEEN SRI LANKAN CIVILIANS AND ELEMENTS OF THE 
INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE (IPKF).  THE GROWING THREAT 
OF SUCH CLASHES BETWEEN SRI LANKANS AND INDIAN TROOPS 
APPARENTLY LIES BEHIND THE DECISION TO SEND SEVERAL 
BATTALIONS OF INDIAN POLICE INTO THE NORTHERN AND 
EASTERN PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA (REFTEL).  THERE IS 
GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THE LTTE 
CONTINUES ITS PROVOCATIONS, THE INDIAN FORCES SHOULD 
MOVE MORE DECISIVELY AGAINST IT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE MEA SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED THAT A CROWD OF 900 
TO 1000 PEOPLE--MAINLY LTTE SUPPORTERS WITH WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN IN THE VANGUARD--COLLECTED IN FRONT OF THE 
IPKF CAMP IN MANNAR, OSTENSIBLY WANTING TO PRESENT A 
PETITION TO THE LOCAL INDIAN MILITARY COMMANDER. 
WHILE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE FOR RECEIVING THE 
PETITION, THE LTTE SUPPORTERS REPORTEDLY STARTED 
THROWING STRONES, SHOUTING SLOGANS, AND PUSHING THE 
CROWD INTO THE CAMP.  THE IPKF FIRED FIVE ROUNDS.  TWO 
PERSONS REPORTEDLY WERE WOUNDED BY THE FIRING AND 17 
INJURED N THE RESULTING STAMPEDE.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LTTE, ONE OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE 
SUBSEQUENTLY DIED.  ACCORDING TO THE MEA SPOKESMAN, 
THE USE OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS A COVER FOR 
THE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WAS \"REPREHENSIBLE AND 
COWARDLY.\"  HE WARNED THEAT INDIAN TROOPS WOULD BE 
\"COMPELLED TO RESPOND WITH EVEN STRONGER MEASURES IF 
VIOLENCE IS DELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY THE LTTE.\" 
 
3. (U) ACCORDING TO MAJOR INDIAN NEWSPAPERS ON 
SEPTEMBER 25, BOTH THE INDIAN AND SRI LANKAN 
GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING IPKF-CIVILIAN 
TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND AGREED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT 
OF THE INDIAN PARALIMITARY RESERVE POLICE FORCE 
(REFTEL) IS NECESSARY FOR CROWD-CONTROL DUTIES.  \"IT 
WAS FELT BY BOTH COUNTRIES THAT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF 
INDIA THE ARMY MUST NOT BE USED REGULARLY TO PREVENT 
ETHNIC OR OTHER RIOTS EXCEPT IN EXTREME EMERGENCIES 
AND FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS.  IT IS ALSO FELT THAT THE 
PRESENCE OF THE ARMY SOMETIMES ACTS AS AN IRRITANT TO 
GROUPS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN WARFARE FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME. . . .  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRPF UNITS 
WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH TEARGAS SHELLS, RUBBER BULLETS, 
AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER SUCH VIOLENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS BY MOBS. . . . THESE FORCES CAN ALSO BE 
USED FOR PATROLLING AREAS FROM WHERE REPORTS OF 
COLONIZATION BY SINHALAS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.\" 
 
4. (C) COMMENT.  SUCCESSIVE GOI WARNINGS TO THE LTTE 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIGH EMPHASIS IN THE INDIAN MEDIA. 
THERE APPEARS TO BE A GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG INFORMED 
INDIANS--WHICH IS BEGINNING TO BE EXPRESSED IN 
NEWSPAPER COMMENTARIES--THAT THE IPKF MUST MOVE 
DECISIVELY AND FAST TO PREVENT THE INDO-SRI LANKA 
ACCORD FROM GOING \"THE WAY OF THE PUNJAB ACCORD.\" 
THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE GOI WON 
AMONG TAMILS BY ITS AIR-DROP IN JUNE IS BEING ERODED 
BY LTTE PROPOGANDA ALLEGING THAT THE IPKF IS ACTING AS 
AN ALLY OF THE COLOMBO GOVERNMENT.  \"THE SITUATION CAN 
BE SAVED AND THE ATMOSPHERE CREATED FOR MODERATE 
LEADERS TO COME INTO THE OPEN,\" THE TIMES OF INDIA 
STATES, \"ONLY IF THE INDIAN TROOPS MOVE QUICKLY AND 
DISARM THE LTTE COMPLETELY.\"

2. (S) EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE MORE INFORMATION ON 
THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) AS REQUESTED IN 
REFTEL.  POST PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION, OBTAINED 
BY THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICE THROUGH ITS CONTACTS IN THE 
INDIAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU IN THE HOME MINISTRY, WHICH 
PROVIDED A WRITTEN REPORT ON THE JKIF.  POLOFFS HAVE HEARD 
VERY LITTLE FROM CONTACTS IN KASHMIR VALLEY REGARDING THE 
JKIF, AS MOST OF THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN 
CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE VALLEY.  NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE 
VARIOUS MILITANT GROUPS IN KASHMIR HAVE NEVER INCLUDED THE 
JKIF AS A MILITANT GROUP OF PROMINENCE IN KASHMIR. 
 
BEGIN TEXT  (ENTIRE TEXT IS CONFIDENTIAL): 
 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) 
 
THE GENESIS OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) 
DATES BACK TO 1989 WHEN ITS PRECURSOR, THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR 
STUDENTS LIBERATION FRONT (JKSLF), WAS FLOATED BY HILAL BEG 
FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES WITH YASIN MALIK, THE THEN COMMANDER- 
IN-CHIEF OF JKLF.  THE JKSLF INDULGED IN HIGH-PROFILE 
KIDNAPPING AND MURDER CASES.  LATER IN APRIL 1991, HILAL BEG 
WAS PERSUADED BY PAKISTAN\'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE 
DIVISION (ISI) TO RENAME THE JKSLF AS IKHWAN-UL-MUSALMEEN 
(IUM).  THE IUM LED BY HILAL BEG WAS TASKED BY PAKISTAN ISI 
TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE JAMMU AND KASHMIR. 
FOR THIS PURPOSE, HILAL BEG CREATED A NETWORK OF HIS AGENTS 
IN CALCUTTA, BIHAR, ANDHRA PRADESH, KATHMANDU, AND DHAKA. 
THE ARREST OF FOUR MUSLIM TERRORISTS (INCLUDING 3 KASHMIRIS) 
IN OCTOBER 1993 AT HYDERABAD AND CALCUTTA REVEALED THE PLANS 
OF THE IUM TO STAGE BOMBAY-TYPE BLASTS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF 
INDIA BY RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND ORGANISING GROUPS OF 
SABOTEURS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
 
THE JKIF WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY ONE SAJJAD AHMED 
KENU, WHO WAS A WELL-KNOWN ACTIVIST OF THE IUM.  SAJJAD KENU 
HAD ESCAPED FROM SRINAGAR JAIL IN JUNE 1995 AND RESURFACED 
AS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE JKIF IN SEPTEMBER 1995. 
SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE JKIF HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERABLE 
PRESSURE FROM ITS PAKISTAN-BASED LEADERSHIP TO CARRY OUT 
BOMB BLASTS OUTSIDE J&K, PARTICULARLY IN DELHI.  ON NOVEMBER 
21, 1995, THE JKIF KINGPIN KHURSHEED AHMED, A.K.A. NAYEEM 
(SINCE KILLED), ENGINEERED A HIGH INTENSITY BLAST WITH THE 
HELP OF TWO SIKHS, NAMELY HARDEEP SINGH, A.K.A. NEELA, AND 
HIS BROTHER RAJINDER, CLOTH VENDORS IN SRINAGAR.  THIS 
EXPLOSION, IN THE CONNAUGHT PLACE AREA OF NEW DELHI, INJURED 
23 PERSONS AND DAMAGED A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND SHOPS. 
BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1995, THE SAME SIKH 
MILITANTS ALSO CAUSED TWO SIMULTANEOUS GRENADE EXPLOSIONS 
NEAR THE RED FORT IN DELHI, INJURING 47 PERSONS.  THE JKIF 
ALSO CAUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSION IN SADAR BAZAR, DELHI, ON 
JANUARY 3, 1996, IN WHICH 7 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 36 
INJURED. 
 
THE JKIF WAS CONTROLLED FROM PAKISTAN BY PAKISTAN ISI AND 
TIGER MEMON (PRIME ACCUSED IN THE BOMBAY BOMB BLAST CASES OF 
1993).  THEIR CONTACT IN PAKISTAN-OCCUPIED KASHMIR WAS BILAL 
BEG, WHO WAS RUNNING AN INDOCTRINATION CAMP NEAR 
MUZAFFARABAD, FUNDED EXTENSIVELY BY THE ISI TO CARRY OUT 
TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIA, ONE COLONEL FAROOQ OF PAKISTAN ISI 
TASKED BILAL BEG AND TIGER MEMON TO UTILISE KATHMANDU-BASED 
ACTIVISTS LATEEF AND JAVED KRAWAH TO SET OFF BLASTS IN DELHI 
BEFORE THE LOK SABHA [UPPER HOUSE OF THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT] 
ELECTIONS.  A TEAM OF COMMITTED JKIF CADRES WAS GIVEN A TWO 
WEEK SPECIALISED CAPSULE COURSE IN EXPLOSIVES NEAR THE 
AFGHAN BORDER IN MARCH-APRIL 1996.  ON MAY 21, 1996, THIS 
JKIF TEAM SET OFF A VERY HIGH INTENSITY EXPLOSION AT LAJPAT 
NAGAR, NEW DELHI, IN WHICH 13 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 40 
OTHERS INJURED.  THE RDX USED IN THIS BLAST WAS BROUGHT FROM 
KATHMANDU.  ALTHOUGH OTHER ACCUSED, NAMELY FAROOQ KHAN, 
A.K.A. ANWAR SADAT LATIF, JAVED CHHOTA, MEHMOOD KILLE, NAZA 
(ALL KASHMIRIS) AND NAUSHAD (A DELHI MUSLIM) WERE ARRESTED, 
JAVED KRAWAH AND RIAZ, A.K.A. RIAZ MULLA, MANAGED TO ESCAPE. 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS, JAVED KRAWAH IS IN PAKISTAN 
AT PRESENT.  THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION IN A RAJASTHAN 
ROADWAYS BUS NEAR DAUSA ON MAY 22, 1996 WAS ALSO ENGINEERED 
BY THE JKIF.  ANOTHER JKIF TEAM UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF 
ABDUL GANI, A.K.A. ASSADULLAH, WAS SENT TO EXECUTE A BOMB 
BLAST IN AHMEDABAD.  THE BLAST WAS PREVENTED BY THE TIMELY 
ARREST OF TEAM MEMBERS IN AHMEDABAD AND THE SEIZURE OF THEIR 
HIGH GRADE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. 
 
JKIF AGAIN PLANNED A CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS IN DELHI BEFORE 
REPUBLIC DAY 1997 AT THE BEHEST OF PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER 
MEMON.  ONE FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, TASKED BY 
BILAL AHMED BEG AND JAVED KRAWAH IN PAKISTAN, WAS GIVEN 20 
KG OF RDX AND MONEY IN KATHMANDU.  BEFORE HE COULD EXECUTE 
THE PLAN, FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, ALONG WITH 
GHULAM RASOOL MIR, A.K.A. GOGA, AIJAZ AHMED CHOUDHARY, NAZIR 
AHMED, AND MANZOOR AHMED DANPOSH, A.K.A. JAN, WERE ARRESTED 
IN KATHMANDU ON DECEMBER 11, 1996. 
 
FOR ALL THESE VIOLENT ACTIVITIES, THE JKIF HAS BEEN 
EXTENSIVELY USING KATHMANDU AS ITS BASE WITH THE ACTIVE 
CONNIVANCE OF PAKISTAN ISI.  TO DISPATCH MEN AND MATERIAL, 
AND TO EXECUTE EXPLOSIONS IN INDIA, KATHMANDU WAS INVARIABLY 
MADE THE NODAL POINT AND JKIF EXPLOITED THE VULNERABLE 
KATHMANDU-BASED KASHMIRI BUSINESSMEN FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES 
SINCE THEY HAD A READYMADE AND CLEAN PAST.  JKIF KINGPIN 
JAVED KRAWAH HIMSELF USED TO RUN A CARPET BUSINESS IN 
KATHMANDU.

COUNSELOR ERIC TUNIS, REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  INDIAN OFFICIAL REACTION TO 
PAKISTAN\'S RECENT FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI BALLISTIC 
MISSILE (REFTEL) HAS BEEN MEASURED THUS FAR.  THE NEWS 
OF THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST RAN SECOND TO THE 
CORONATION OF SONIA GANDHI AS THE NEW LEADER OF THE 
CONGRESS PARTY IN MOST NEWSPAPERS ON APRIL 7.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES GAVE A COOL AND DELIBERATE 
STATEMENT TO A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEW DELHI ON THE 
EVENING OF APRIL 6, NOTING THAT INDIA HAD PRIOR 
INFORMATION OF THE TEST.  FERNANDES DREW A DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN TEST FIRING OF THE MISSILE AND PRODUCTION, BUT 
HE AVOIDED ANY COMMENT ON INDIA\'S AGNI MISSILE PROGRAM. 
THE DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND SECURITY AFFAIRS 
(DISA) IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CONFIRMED 
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECENT SENIOR INTERAGENCY MEETING 
TO DISCUSS INDIA\'S RESPONSE TO THE MISSILE TEST.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
PROMINENT COVERAGE--BUT RELATIVELY MILD REACTION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2.  (U)  INDIAN NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION PROVIDED 
EXTENSIVE BUT NOT INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OF THE RECENT 
TEST OF PAKISTAN\'S GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE.  MOST OF 
THE PRESS STORIES DREW HEAVILY FROM INFORMATION 
RELEASED PUBLICLY BY PAKISTAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY AS 
WELL AS THEIR OWN DECIDEDLY INDIAN ACCOUNT OF FACTS, 
SUCH AS THE TIMES OF INDIA CLAIM THAT THE TEST WAS 
CARRIED OUT AT THE KAHUTA NUCLEAR RESEARCH LABORATORY. 
THIS EVENT HAS PROVIDED ANOTHER FORUM FOR PROMINENT 
HAWKS IN THE MEDIA--SUCH AS IDSA\'S DIRECTOR JASJIT 
SINGH--TO RENEW CALLS FOR INDIA\'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
AGNI BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.  OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE 
ALSO PORTRAYED THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST AS CONCLUSIVE 
PROOF THAT THE U.S. HAS FAILED TO STOP COOPERATION 
BETWEEN CHINA AND PAKISTAN IN BALLISTIC MISSILE 
TECHNOLOGY.  INDEED, MUCH OF THE INDIAN PUBLIC AND 
PRIVATE THINKING SEEMS TO REFLECT THE INHERENT DISDAIN 
FOR PAKISTAN\'S SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, OF WHICH BRAHMIN 
HINDUS ARE CONVINCED COULD NOT PRODUCE SUCH A MISSILE 
INDEPENDENTLY. 
 
3.  (U)  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES WAS THE 
GOI\'S MAIN SPOKESMAN FOR THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS 
ISSUE.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE APRIL 6, HE MADE THE 
FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
--   INDIA\'S OWN MISSILE PROGRAM IS CONTINUING. 
PRITHVI MISSILES ARE CAPABLE OF REACHING ANYWHERE IN 
PAKISTAN; 
 
--   INDIA HAD PRIOR WARNING THAT ISLAMABAD HAD BEEN 
PREPARING TO TEST A MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE; HE DESCRIBED 
THE TEST AS NOT UNEXPECTED BUT OF A SERIOUS NATURE, 
ALTHOUGH INDIA AND PAKISTAN ARE NOT IN A WAR-LIKE 
SITUATION; 
 
--   THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TESTING AND 
PRODUCTION; AND 
 
--   IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO FIND OUT WHAT 
HAPPENED IN SINO-PAKISTANI MISSILE COOPERATION DESPITE 
THE EXISTENCE OF MULTILATERAL CONTROL REGIMES. 
 
 
SOME INSIGHTS FROM MEA 
---------------------- 
4.  (C)  POLOFF MET WITH AJIT KUMAR, DIRECTOR FOR 
DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS IN THE 
MINISTRY FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ON APRIL 7 (SEE SEPTEL 
FOR A DISCUSSION OF CWC ISSUES).  KUMAR CONFIRMED THAT 
SENIOR INDIAN OFFICIALS FROM SEVERAL MINISTRIES HAD MET 
SEVERAL DAYS AGO TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION REGARDING 
THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST.  KUMAR OPINED THAT FERNANDES 
WAS SELECTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INDIAN 
GOVERNMENT BY THIS GROUP; MEA DID NOT INTEND TO MAKE 
ANY STATEMENT ON THE MATTER.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, KUMAR 
AGREED THAT THE MISSILE ISSUE WAS RIPE FOR DISCUSSION 
IN AN INDO-PAKISTANI DIALOGUE, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN NO SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF SECURITY 
ISSUES AS THE TWO SIDES REMAINED DEAD-LOCKED OVER THE 
PROCEDURAL LOGJAM OF ADDRESSING KASHMIR. 

 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C)  IN RESPONDING TO THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST, WE 
SUSPECT THE INDIANS WILL ALLOW ACTIONS TO SPEAK LOUDER 
THAN WORDS, WITH AN AGNI MISSILE TEST IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE.  IT IS WORTH RECALLING COMMITMENTS BY PREVIOUS 
INDIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT THE AGNI PROGRAM REMAINED A 
HIGH PRIORITY, AND THAT THE INDIANS HAVE BEEN MULLING 
OVER A DECISION TO TEST THE AGNI FOR SOME TIME NOW. 
INDEED, JASJIT SINGH TOLD US THAT HE MADE ONE MORE RUN 
AT PUSHING FOR AN AGNI TEST DURING GUJRAL\'S FINAL WEEKS 
IN OFFICE.  THIS BJP-LED GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DEFENSE A 
PROMINENT ISSUE IN ITS AGENDA AND SEVERAL OF ITS 
\"SECURITY EXPERTS\" HAVE CALLED FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT 
OF LONGER RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES TO ADDRESS THE 
PERCEIVED CHINA THREAT.  THE DEFENSE MINISTER\'S 
COMMENTS THAT INDIA CAN TARGET ALL OF PAKISTAN WITH 
PRITHVI MISSILES CERTAINLY BOLSTERS ISLAMABAD\'S BELIEF 
THAT IT NEEDS LONGER RANGE MISSILES TO KEEP UP WITH ITS 
SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBOR.  THE UPCOMING VISITS OF SENIOR 
U.S. OFFICIALS WILL PRESENT A USEFUL OPPORTUNITY TO 
URGE RESTRAINT WITH BOTH SIDES, ALTHOUGH NEW DELHI 
ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO PORTRAY ITS MISSILE 
PROGRAMS AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CHINA THREAT.

1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh watchers in New Delhi have reacted 
with concern to recent violence there, citing the August 21 
attack on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina as symptomatic of a 
deterioration in the country\'s political culture, fueling 
instability in Bangladesh which contributes directly to 
violence in India\'s northeast.  Home Secretary Dhirendra 
Singh will raise these issues and others when he travels to 
Dhaka later in September.  In a new twist, some prominent 
Indian commentators are now blaming the GOI for having an 
inadequate Bangladesh policy.  The Bangladeshi High 
Commission insists Indo-Bangladesh relations are excellent. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) While the April 2 Chittagong arms haul and the 
attempted assassination of the British High Commissioner in 
Sylhet, have worried Indian Bangladesh watchers, the August 
21 attack on Awami League Leader Sheikh Hasina set off a new 
round of concern in New Delhi.  General (Retd.) Dipankar 
Banerjee, Director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict 
Studies (IPCS) called the grenade attack \"a violent 
manifestation of Islamic extremism,\" which had grown in 
Bangladesh.  \"The Hindu\" editorialized that the incident was 
a result of the BDG\'s \"laissez faire attitude towards 
extremist groups.\"  Dr. Sreeradha Datta, Associate Fellow at 
the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses (IDSA) warned 
us that pervasive lawlessness in many parts of Bangladesh 
enables extremist individuals and groups to operate outside 
Dhaka\'s reach. 
 
Bangladesh\'s Backyard 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) These concerns about extremist groups based in 
Bangladesh, reiterated by MEA officials during Ambassador 
Cofer Black\'s Counterterrorism Joint Working Group meeting 
(Ref C), are nothing new.  What is new is that the GOI may be 
prepared to engage more directly with Dhaka to tackle some of 
these issues.  During his upcoming September 16-17 trip to 
Dhaka, Home Secretary Dhirendra Singh will provide to the BDG 
a list of insurgents\' installations, for the sixth time, 
according to MEA Under Secretary (Bangladesh) Puneet Kundal. 
He told Poloff the meeting is intended to restart a dialogue 
on security issues that has been stalled since 2000.  Singh 
will also request the BDG to turn over fugitives the GOI 
believes have taken refuge in Bangladesh, reportedly 
including United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) 
Commander-in-Chief Paresh Barua.  The problem, Kundal 
explained, is that Bangladesh sees India\'s northeast as its 
\"backyard.\"  New Delhi can take no other approach, Kundal 
added, except to continue to have talks, biannually between 
the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles, and at 
the Home Secretary level. 
 
4. (C) The August 21 attack on Hasina has deepened Indian 
concerns about the links between Bangladesh-based groups and 
guerrillas in India\'s northeast.  The group that Indian media 
reported as responsible for the incident, 
Harkat-ul-Jehad-I-Islami Bangladesh (HUJI-B), has connections 
that can be traced to India, according to Delhi-based South 
Asia Terrorism Portal\'s SATP.org.  SATP reports that HUJI-B 
is affiliated with the ULFA and runs ULFA camps in Bangladesh 
as well as sending its own members into West Bengal and 
Assam.  Retired General Banerjee remarked that corruption 
among India\'s Border Security Forces facilitates cross-border 
infiltration.  The MEA\'s Kundal added that there is an 
\"ethnolinguistic homogeneity\" among Bangladeshis and Indians 
in the border area which in combination with Dhaka\'s desire 
for \"leverage\" over New Delhi, contributes to the BDG\'s 
unwillingness to limit militant activity (Ref A). 
 
Neglecting the Neighbor 
----------------------- 
 
5. (U) The Sheikh Hasina incident has prompted a spate of 
analysis of New Delhi\'s policy towards Bangladesh by some of 
India\'s more prominent foreign policy commentators, with 
widespread concern that New Delhi\'s approach has been 
inadequate.  Head of South Asia Studies at Jawarhalal Nehru 
University (JNU) and strategic affairs writer C. Raja Mohan 
on August 27 accused the GOI of \"drift\" in its regional 
foreign policy.  Compared to India\'s current relationships 
with Pakistan and China (its \"two most difficult neighbors\") 
India\'s policy on Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives suffers 
from a \"lack of sustained attention and a seriousness of 
purpose.\"  The attempt on Hasina \"showcased the gathering 
storm,\" in Bangladesh, he wrote.   Similarly, Prem Shankar 
Jha, former editor of the Hindustan Times, wrote of the 
negative effects on Dhaka of India\'s \"past inaction.\"  The 
GOI has taken decisions that have profound impacts on 
Bangladesh, including river interlinking, without consulting 
Dhaka, which has fostered a deep resentment in Bangladesh 
about India, Jha argued. 
 
6. (C) Echoing Mohan and Jha, the IDSA\'s Datta argued that 
New Delhi has contributed to poor ties with Dhaka by not 
keeping its neighbors happy, and that the countries suffer 
from a \"communication gap.\"  General Banerjee described 
India\'s policy towards Bangladesh as \"deliberately 
hands-off,\" although he noted that the GOI has few 
alternatives as India cannot interfere in Bangladesh\'s 
internal affairs.  Wary that India may have to pay a price 
for that policy, retired intelligence officer Bibhuti Bhusan 
Nandy charged in a long, two-part September op-ed piece that 
the NDA looked the other way while minorities became victim 
to \"fundamentalist forces.\" 
 
Bangladesh as a Warning to India 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Prompted by these events \"Hindustan Times\" editor 
Manoj Joshi recently took his analysis of events in 
Bangladesh a step further asking whether India will go the 
way its dysfunctional neighbors already have.  Joshi argued 
that the domestic political situation of complete 
non-cooperation between the two dominant parties in Dhaka has 
\"allowed space for scores of uncontrolled extremist groups.\" 
Urging New Delhi to heed the warning sounding from India\'s 
borders, Joshi wrote that PM Singh should \"make the 
political-administrative system functional again,\" lest India 
go the way of Bangladesh. 
 
High Commission: Everything is OK 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Our contacts at the Bangladesh High Commission (BHC) 
have consistently maintained that reports of terrorist camps 
in Bangladesh are \"baseless\" and \"outrageous.\"  Nonetheless, 
BHC poloff Bodiruzzaman told us on September 2 that while 
there are temporary irritants in the bilateral relationship, 
relations are excellent, and Indians and Bangladeshis are 
\"brothers.\" 
 
Hasina\'s Visit 
-------------- 
 
9. (C) During her late July visit to India, opposition leader 
Sheikh Hasina was received with nearly all the formalities of 
an official visit.  With the exception of a Hyderabad House 
reception, which is strictly reserved for heads of state or 
government, Hasina\'s trip to India included all the trappings 
of a state visit, including calls on Manmohan Singh, Foreign 
Minister K Natwar Singh, and Leader of the Opposition LK 
Advani, and a dinner hosted by the Foreign Minister.  Denying 
the visit any particular significance, the Bangladesh High 
Commission\'s Bodiruzzaman said that such treatment is to be 
expected and is simply a function of a long and good 
relationship. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) It is notable that the UPA government that began its 
term with a strong focus on its immediate neighbors is now 
facing criticism from respected commentators of doing just 
the opposite with regard to Bangladesh.  Although Prime 
Ministers Singh and Zia met at the July 31 BIMSTEC Summit, 
GOI red carpet treatment of Hasina fueled the widely held 
view here that India simply prefers to deal with the Awami 
League and does not have the vision to build a constructive 
relationship with the BNP.  While the Home Secretary\'s visit 
is high-level, there is no talk of a Foreign Minister\'s trip 
to Dhaka until the PM and Natwar Singh travel to Dhaka for 
the January SAARC Summit.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh presents a 
collection of fears for India, which is worried about the 
spillover of extremism and anti-Hindu sentiment, the 
implications of political instability for India\'s own 
internal security in the northeast, groups inimical to India 
operating from within Bangladesh, and the demographic 
consequences of Bangladeshi migration into India.

Classified By: A/DCM Walter E. North, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: During an October 24 meeting with PRM A/S 
Dewey, King Jigme Wangchuck of Bhutan agreed that Category 1 
refugees from the Khudunabari Camp could be repatriated and 
that the Government of Nepal (GON) and the Royal Government 
of Bhutan (RGOB) should exchange a letter specifying the 
modalities.  King Wangchuck also commented, off the record, 
that this refugee situation is unique because Nepal and 
Bhutan have an open border with India and that many of the 
refugees are Indian.  He stated that in private negotiations, 
the GON has not been overly concerned about the refugee 
situation.  Third country resettlement is not an important 
part of the solution, according to the King.  He said the 
conditions of return had been stipulated and are in line with 
Bhutanese citizenship law.  The willingness of the King to 
move on the Category 1 refugees in Khudunabari Camp who had 
already been verified by the Bhutanese and Nepalese Joint 
Verification Teams departed significantly from the message 
A/S Dewey had heard previously from senior RGOB officials who 
held that all the Categories from all the camps must be 
considered before repatriation could start.  End Summary. 
 
An Open Door for Category 1 Refugees? 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) In an October 24 meeting, A/S Dewey appealed to King 
Jigme Wangchuck to help break the impasse over the refugee 
situation in southern Nepal by agreeing to take back Category 
1 refugees from the Khudunabari Camp.  The King agreed to the 
proposal, but stipulated that the GON and the RGOB must first 
draft a letter setting forth the modalities of how 
repatriation would take place.  He promised to instruct his 
Ambassador to India to work with the Nepalese Ambassador to 
draft the letter, and after the language was finalized, the 
GON would send the letter to Thimphu.  King Wangchuck stated 
that the process must be portrayed as a bilateral initiative 
) and not as a proposal advanced by an outside party.  He 
emphasized the need to inform India of this initiative, and 
asked A/S Dewey to request that Ambassador Mulford brief the 
Indian Ministry of External Affairs.  The King requested that 
Ambassador Moriarty similarly inform Minister of State Mahat 
in Kathmandu and support this initiative with Nepal.  In a 
meeting with Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk after a lunch 
hosted for the U.S. delegation by the King, the Foreign 
Minister was instructed to oversee the joint drafting of the 
letters with Minister Mahat. 
 
Indian \"Refugees?\" 
---------------- 
 
3.  (C) The King also asserted that a large number of camp 
residents are Indians and that the camps serve as a magnet 
due to the high quality of services UNHCR provides compared 
to surrounding areas.  He professed surprise that the number 
of refugees was not higher than 100,000, because of the 
discrepancy in services offered inside and outside the camps. 
 He argued that the international community should stop 
providing services in the camps that are not found in the 
surrounding area.  The King also criticized UNHCR policy of 
requiring refugees to obtain daily passes to leave the camps, 
stating that it limited the free movement of people between 
Nepal and India.  He mentioned that the RGOB knows of 2,000 
people who have voluntarily left the camps, without receiving 
passes, to work and visit family members in India.  These 
people should be allowed to chose where they work and travel, 
he argued, because immigration laws of all three countries 
allow it. 
 
Nepal-Bhutan Talks 
------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Private talks between the GON and RGOB have been very 
good and there has been a frank exchange of ideas, commented 
King Wangchuck.  While the official GON line is that all the 
refugees are Bhutanese, the GON knows they are ethnic 
Nepalese and has no reservations about them staying in Nepal, 
he added.  Two to three million people from Bihar currently 
live in the region of the camps, and the GON would prefer the 
100,000 refugees settle there, because it would increase the 
Nepalese percentage of the population.  However, the GON 
cannot admit this, he continued because it is politically too 
risky, and no government in Kathmandu has come to power 
supporting a mandate on a controversial issue.  Also, with 
all the problems Nepal is facing, the government can at least 
boast that it is taking care of 100,000 refugees, even though 
it is not paying for any of the services, commented the King. 
 
5.  (C) King Wangchuck stated that the GON goal soon after 
the refugee crisis began was to increase the numbers of 
people in the camps from 6,000 to over 100,000 to ensure that 
UNHCR would have to get involved and provide support.  The 
King then reiterated the Bhutanese complaint that UNHCR had 
compounded the problem by not adequately screening refugees. 
He doubted they could remain neutral after 12 years as \"judge 
and jury\" and consistently calling the people in the camps 
\"Bhutanese Refugees.\"  He added that while the RGOB has had 
problems with the UNHCR, there was no point in \"harping on 
the past\" and that it was time to move forward.  If the UNHCR 
stopped funding the camps it would not be a large problem, 
because those refugees who could not find jobs in Nepal could 
do so in India, he stated. 
 
Third Country Resettlement 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) There is no need for third country resettlement, 
which is only a \"hypothetical solution,\" the King maintained. 
 The refugee situation is \"very unique, but very simple,\" he 
argued, because all the refugees are from India, Nepal and 
Bhutan and therefore only those three countries are needed 
for a solution.  The refugees are free to live and work in 
India, Nepal and Bhutan, but only under the citizenship laws 
of each country, he remarked.  Because the people in the 
camps are from one of the three counties, the refugees would 
only become stateless by deciding to go the third country 
resettlement route.  While he welcomed that option, it was 
not necessary. 
 
Conditions of Return 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) King Wangchuck stated that the RGOB had given UNHCR 
and the GON the conditions of return prior to the December 
2003 attack in the Khudunabari camp.  Any issue involving 
disbursement of land would be covered under Bhutanese law. 
If a person had sold his land before leaving Bhutan, that 
person would not be eligible to get it back or be given any 
free acreage from the RGOB.  However, the king noted that 
those who had been illegally evicted would have the right to 
get property back, and he fully expected that some returning 
category 1 refugees would file cases to do so.  The Joint 
Verification Teams (JVT) had agreed to a liberal 
interpretation of the law, but stressed they would not go so 
far as to change property or citizenship laws, he commented. 
 
8.  (C) King Wangchuck assured A/S Dewey that there would be 
no risk for return of Category 1 refugees, that they would be 
fully protected by Bhutanese citizenship laws, and that the 
numbers of returnees does not matter, as long as they were 
bona fide Bhutanese citizens.   A/S Dewey raised this again 
with the Foreign Minister at the dinner he hosted in the 
evening of October 24.  The Foreign Minister reiterated 
opposition to UNHCR or any international direct monitoring 
saying, \"you will have to trust us.  But we would not dare 
violate their citizenship rights given the number of UN 
agencies accredited in Bhutan that will be watching.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The King\'s decision to accept Category 1 refugees 
from the Khudunabari camp, prior to completion of the JVT 
surveys of the other camps, was a surprise response to A/S 
Dewey,s personal appeal to try to find a way around the 
seemingly impenetrable \"swamp,\" rather than to keep 
revisiting it.  It was also a change from the message A/S 
Dewey heard from other senior members of the RGOB, including 
Prime Minister Yeshey Zimba and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Khandu Wangchuck.  The two ministers repeated old RGOB 
positions and focused on the history of the refugee 
situation, the need for Bhutan to protect its national 
security, the violence committed against the Bhutanese JVT 
members, and a desire for recognition from the US for 
Bhutanese support on Iraq and Article 98.  The King clearly 
took the matter in his own hands to set out a formula to get 
by the impasse.  He defined the concept, then instructed the 
Foreign Minister to work out the details so that repatriation 
of this discrete group could begin. 
10.  (U) A/S Dewey has cleared this cable.

1.  (C) Summary:  India underlined its concerns about the 
lack of democracy in Burma during the recent visit of 
Rangoon\'s military leader Than Shwe, with Prime Minister 
Manmohan Singh himself delivering the message, MEA Joint 
Secretary (South East Asia - I) Mitra Vashishta told us on 
 
SIPDIS 
November 1.  The decision to encourage democracy in Rangoon 
reflects the GOI belief that India is best placed to help 
Burma reform, that Aung San Sui Kyi\'s \"time has come and 
gone,\" and that democracy will take root in Burma only 
through greater engagement and people-to-people ties. 
Vashishta cited the October 29-31 visit to New Delhi of UN 
Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail as evidence of India\'s 
resolve to stay engaged on democracy in Burma.  The GOI would 
welcome US suggestions on how to best to promote democracy 
there, and has agreed to provide grants and limited military 
equipment to Rangoon in an attempt to encourage cooperation 
against anti-India insurgents located along the Indo-Burma 
border.  However, there are no Indian plans to conduct joint 
military operations with the junta.  PolCouns stressed our 
concerns about the safety and treatment of ASSK and the 
democratic opposition under Burma\'s new Prime Minister (ref 
A), and urged India to continue to press for democratic 
reform in Rangoon.  End Summary. 
 
Democracy 
--------- 
 
2.  (C) Democracy topped India\'s agenda for the October 24-29 
visit of Burma\'s military leader Than Shwe, MEA Joint 
Secretary (South East Asia - I) Mitra Vashishta told PolCouns 
 
SIPDIS 
and Poloff on November 1.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 
himself raised the issue with Than Shwe \"in a much more 
intense way than could be expressed\" in the media, she said, 
noting that India had decided to raise the issue of democracy 
with Burma despite potentially negative consequences for the 
relationship.  Vashishta reported that New Delhi had to 
battle for the inclusion of a joint statement paragraph 
emphasizing India\'s desire to see \"a stable, peaceful, 
prosperous and democratic Myanmar.\"  She commented that the 
Burmese delegation was \"willing to do anything\" to have that 
paragraph removed, adding that the inclusion of the paragraph 
was a \"coup for India.\"  The final version of the document 
released on October 29 \"expressed support for national 
reconciliation and an early transition to democracy in 
Myanmar.\" 
 
3.  (C) Asked about New Delhi\'s plan to further encourage 
democracy in Burma, Vashishta responded that Rangoon 
considers India a democratic role model, and emphasized that 
the GOI has the \"best credentials\" to promote democracy 
there.  She mused that democracy could only be established 
through grass-roots initiatives, and stressed that India 
would do \"whatever it takes\" to empower the people of Burma 
in this respect.  Referring to the increased people-to-people 
ties between India and Pakistan, Vashishta said that the GOI 
plans to pursue a similar strategy with Burma by promoting 
culture and sports links between the two countries.  \"We are 
much less bothered by the situation in Burma than in 
Pakistan,\" she noted, adding that she would welcome US 
suggestions on how to encourage greater reform in Rangoon. 
 
4.  (C) According to Vashishta, democracy in Burma is too 
closely linked with the greatly respected Aung San Sui Kyi 
(ASSK), whose \"day has come and gone.\"  She said that Than 
Shwe had expressed a commitment to democracy during the 
visit, and speculated that he would be more apt to bring 
about democratic reform if he could do so without losing 
face.  PolCouns underlined US concerns about the lack of 
democracy in Burma and expressed the hope that India would 
continue to press this issue with the junta. 
 
Engaging Burma, Meeting India\'s Strategic Needs 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (C) Describing the Than Shwe trip as \"entirely devoted to 
India\'s interests,\" Vashishta stated that New Delhi decided 
to proceed with the visit, even after the ouster of former-PM 
Khin Nyunt because the GOI did not view the replacement of 
Nyunt as an indication of \"which way the dust would fall\" on 
democracy.  The GOI believes the coup was an \"internal 
struggle,\" she said, speculating that the junta may be 
somewhat fragile.  As evidence, Vashishta observed that Than 
Shwe traveled with the wives of two other powerful generals, 
Thura Shwe Man and Soe Win, who she mused may have been used 
as \"hostages\" to ensure tranquillity among the generals in 
Rangoon during Than Shwe\'s absence. 
 
6.  (C) Vashishta reiterated India\'s belief that only 
constructive engagement of the military regime could bring 
about any meaningful change, saying sanctions have only 
isolated Burma, and have not encouraged democratic reforms 
there.  Burma is so isolated that members of Than Shwe\'s 
delegation wondered whether they would have to \"go nuclear\" 
to get US attention, she remarked, noting the comparison to 
Pakistan.  She emphasized that if India also isolates Burma, 
no one will be able to engage Rangoon on democracy or other 
issues. 
 
7.  (C) Flagging that the timing of UN Special Envoy for 
Burma Razali Ismail\'s October 29-31 visit to New Delhi was 
not coincidental, Vashishta expressed India\'s desire to work 
with the UN on Burma.  However, she argued that the 
organization \"has lost credibility\" in the eyes of developing 
countries and should at least make an attempt to be more 
\"pro-Myanmar.\"  The EU is too \"obvious, shabby, shortsighted 
and full of contradictions\" to play a meaningful role in 
Burma, she argued, while Thailand takes a pro-active approach 
to Rangoon only \"because one of their ministers wants to be 
the next UN Secretary General.\" 
 
Counter-Terrorism Agreement 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Billing the Memorandum of Understanding on 
\"Non-Traditional Security Issues\" as an agreement on counter 
terrorism \"whatever they call it,\" Vashishta said the MOU 
outlines Rangoon\'s obligations to crack-down on anti-India 
militants operating out of Burmese territory.  The GOI does 
not believe that Rangoon is fueling the insurgents to 
pressure New Delhi because \"it is not in Burma\'s strategic 
interest,\" but New Delhi is growing increasingly concerned 
about insurgent activities in the border regions.  The GOB 
agreed to move troops to the Indo-Burmese border \"not because 
of their interests, but because some of India\'s interests are 
now tied up with theirs,\" Vashishta said, citing economic 
development as an example.  She expressed optimism that Burma 
was taking India\'s request seriously, unlike in the past. 
She noted that Soe Win, Burma\'s new PM, had previously 
commanded forces along the border with India.  PolCouns 
stressed our concerns about the safety and treatment of ASSK 
and the democratic opposition, given Soe Win\'s direct 
involvement in the May 30, 2003 attack on ASSK and her 
followers (ref A).  Vashishta had different information, 
alleging that some of the opposition parties were hopeful 
about a near-term political opening. 
 
No To Military Exercises, Yes To Grants 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Although the India-Burma joint statement on Than 
Shwe\'s visit mentions the \"possibilities of expanding 
cooperation\" in defense, Vashishta categorically stated that 
joint military exercises \"are absolutely ruled out,\" saying 
this is \"a big, firm no.\"  She indicated the GOI could 
provide limited military equipment to Rangoon, \"on par with 
what the rest of ASEAN provides,\" but is \"very careful\" when 
it comes to military cooperation with Burma. 
10.  (C) Vashishta confirmed plans to provide Burma with a 
USD 20 million dollar grant to be used for energy, gas, and 
upgrading refining facilities, and said the money would be 
used to entice Rangoon to reform.  She explained that the 
junta would not receive the funds unless \"they do certain 
things,\" saying that India hopes to \"engage them (with the 
grant) and slowly lay down conditions for reform.\"  She cast 
this as part of New Delhi\'s people-to-people strategy. 
 
China 
----- 
 
11.  (C) Expressing concern about Chinese influence in Burma, 
Vashishta said that the State Peace and Development Council 
(SPDC) has been \"learning from the master about how to 
hoodwink the international community\" on human rights.  She 
said that China would like an Indian Ocean port and hopes to 
project its influence \"everywhere India does.\"  Vashishta 
argued that \"what you hear about the PLA in Burma is only the 
tip of the iceberg,\" as US intelligence must know.  Burmese 
engagement with India stems in part from Rangoon\'s belief 
that \"China takes them for granted,\" she asserted. 
 
Religion 
-------- 
 
12.  (C) Commenting on the delegation\'s visit to several 
important Buddhist shrines in India, Vashishta noted that 
over the last three years, Than Shwe had repeatedly requested 
a pilgrimage to the sites and speculated that the religious 
journey was a major factor behind the trip.  She claimed that 
this pilgrimage was not just aimed a burnishing the junta\'s 
Buddhist credentials, but rather was related to Than Shwe\'s 
personal sense of mortality.  But she added, the Burmese 
military did not think they had done anything wrong, and do 
not need to atone for their sins. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (C) Led by Foreign Secretary Saran, a former Ambassador 
to Rangoon, the GOI has embarked on a major diplomatic 
initiative with Burma.  India\'s policy toward the GOB is 
pragmatic, based largely on New Delhi\'s security interests, 
but also reflects the GOI\'s desire eventually to see a 
democratic Burma to its east.  India has welcomed US input 
about how best to encourage democracy there, presenting an 
opportunity that we should seize upon to expand the US-India 
regional dialogue to include developments in Rangoon.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, PK, IZ, IN, External Political Relations 
SUBJECT: JASWANT IN THE WILDERNESS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador David Mulford, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a warm and constructive November 1 
discussion with the Ambassador, Parliamentary Opposition 
Leader Jaswant Singh reaffirmed his commitment to the 
US-India relationship, remarking that \"I have paid a 
political price for my support of better relations\" between 
New Delhi and Washington, \"but I will continue to do so 
because it\'s the right thing for India.\"  Not surprisingly, 
Jaswant was highly critical of Congress\' performance in 
government, arguing that Manmohan Singh did not have the 
stature or temperament to hold together a multi-party 
coalition as Vajpayee did.  Jaswant cautioned that 
suggestions the BJP should support the UPA\'s efforts to 
continue economic reform were undercut by the \"personal 
vendetta\" that some in the Congress have been conducting. 
The former Foreign Minister was typically downbeat about US 
policy in Pakistan, complaining that Washington had granted 
President Musharraf \"a veto\" over the US-India relationship. 
On Iraq, Jaswant worried about the prospect of partition 
along ethnic and religious lines.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Reviving a relationship that began when Jaswant Singh 
was Finance Minister, the Ambassador, joined by PolCouns, 
called on the Rajya Sabha Opposition Leader at his New Delhi 
residence on November 1.  Jaswant was completely at ease in 
his role as an opposition politician, remarking wistfully on 
his official residence \"in the servants\' quarters\" of the 
Prime Minister\'s compound.  Jaswant made only a passing 
reference to the recent controversy over the Secretary\'s 
description of the US role in helping to sustain efforts at 
Indo-Pak diplomacy in April 2003.  He recalled that Vajpayee 
had made three major efforts at rapprochement with Pakistan 
-- at Lahore (1999), Agra (2001) and Srinagar (2003).  In 
each instance, he argued, the only driver was the Prime 
Minister\'s personal resolve to make peace with Pakistan his 
lasting legacy.  Without going into details, Jaswant 
expressed concern that President Musharraf and the Pakistani 
leadership have still not made the strategic decision to 
abandon hostility to India. 
 
US-India 
-------- 
 
3. (C) On the broader US-India relationship, Jaswant was 
unequivocal, recalling how he and the Prime Minister resolved 
between themselves to make relations with Washington an NDA 
priority.  \"I have paid a political price for my support of 
better relations\" between New Delhi and Washington, Jaswant 
declared, joking that he had been labeled as a \"CIA agent\" 
within the NDA.  He declared that \"I will continue (this 
support for US-India partnership) because it\'s the right 
thing for India.\"  Jaswant was completely gracious in his 
recollection of his early meetings with Bush Administration 
officials, describing in detail how touched he had been by 
the time that the President spent with him during his May 
2001 visit to Washington.  Echoing remarks he made earlier 
this year to former Deputy Secretary Talbott (and recounted 
in Talbott\'s memoirs), Jaswant offered a long soliloquy on 
the unfulfilled potential of the US-India relations.  He 
lamented that \"Musharraf has been given a veto\" over the pace 
of US-India relations, and complained that the war in Iraq 
and our respective election cycles have left both Washington 
and New Delhi too distracted to focus on our bilateral agenda. 
 
Arc of Crisis 
------------- 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador cited the NSSP as evidence of 
Washington\'s commitment to the India relationship and 
challenged Jaswant\'s implication that Iraq was less than an 
urgent challenge to international security, which promoted 
the former Foreign Minister to back track from his comments. 
However, after acknowledging that policy makers must work 
with the world as they find it, Jaswant added that he is 
gravely concerned about the prospect that Iraq will fracture 
along ethnic and religious lines.  Pulling from his library a 
well thumbed copy of David Fromkin\'s \"Peace to End All 
Peace,\" Jaswant cited the British legacy in the Middle East 
as the root of the region\'s current tumult, reiterating 
concern that an artificially drawn Iraq would eventually 
splinter. 
 
5. (C) Jaswant stayed in his Dickensian mode as the 
conversation turned to Afghanistan, arguing that despite 
surface appearances the situation there remained fragile.  He 
pointed to Karzai\'s US protection detail as an error of US 
tactics that created an image deeply offensive to Karzai\'s 
Pashtun constituency.  Drawing on his experience negotiating 
with Kabul for the release of a hijacked Indian airliner, 
Jaswant counseled against any compromise with the Taliban. 
 
6. (C) On Pakistan, Jaswant recounted the \"sad history\" of US 
engagement with Islamabad to argue that sooner or later India 
will be \"presented with the bill\" for the GOP\'s current 
cooperation with Washington in the war on terrorism.  As in 
the 1980\'s, he argued, the United States will eventually find 
itself at a dead end with its Pakistan policy. 
 
Whither Reform? 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) Jaswant\'s enthusiastic interventions on foreign policy 
betrayed his preference for that dimension of his several 
previous portfolios.  But the former Finance and Defense 
Minister also spoke with authority on issues of governance in 
India.  Jaswant cautioned that the US might want to \"aim off\" 
of (discount) his remarks on Congress, since he speaks now as 
a leader of the opposition bench.  With that caveat, Jaswant 
criticized Manmohan Singh for lacking the stature or 
temperament to hold together a multi-party coalition as 
Vajpayee did.  He called the Home Minister \"a disaster,\" 
described how Pranab Mukherjee had privately acknowledged 
that he knew nothing about the Defense portfolio, implied 
that Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had already been stripped 
of most authority by the PMO, and generally excoriated the 
UPA government. 
 
8. (C) Queried about the BJP\'s approach to economic issues 
now that they are back in opposition, Jaswant argued that 
Congress\' \"personal vendetta\" against the BJP and other NDA 
alliance members made it difficult for people like him who 
would be inclined to support the government\'s effort to 
sustain the process of reform.  He implied that the BJP at 
least for now will be a relentless opposition, taking 
advantage of Congress missteps and contradictions with the 
Left to score easy political points.  He was silent on 
questions of BJP leadership, and the struggle between Hindu 
hard liners and moderates like himself who recognize that a 
middle course is essential to the BJP\'s hopes for returning 
to power.

SUBJECT: INDIA PUSHING NEPALESE ARMY TO BE MORE ACTIVE 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) should be more 
proactive in the fight against the Maoists, MEA Joint 
Secretary (Bhutan/Nepal) Ranjit Rae told Polcouns and Poloff 
 
SIPDIS 
in a November 1 meeting.  Describing the recent India-Nepal 
security cooperation group meeting, Rae reported that the GOI 
pressed the RNA to demonstrate visible results in its 
anti-insurgency campaign.  New Delhi was \"at a loss\" as to 
why the RNA had not been more forceful against the Maoists. 
Rae believed the cease-fire, called on account of a major 
local Hindu holiday, was over and that neither the GON nor 
the Maoists would extend it through the upcoming November 12 
Diwalli holidays, as the GOI had hoped. 
 
2.  (C) Looking ahead to King Gyanendra\'s late November visit 
to India, Rae indicated that New Delhi would press for an 
increased pace of counter-insurgent operations, viewing this 
as, \"one of the few buttons left to press.\"  Rae said the GOI 
will also reiterate to the King New Delhi\'s strong opposition 
to any usurpation of emergency powers by the Palace. The 
Indian DCM from Kathmandu (who was also present during this 
meeting) added that he believed the US was reluctant to use 
the Palace as a conduit to push for more aggressive use of 
the RNA. 
 
3.  (C) Rae speculated that the October merger of the Maoist 
Communist Center and the People\'s War Group to form the 
Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), was influenced by 
the Nepalese Maoists (Reftel 1244).  He observed that this 
development confirmed GOI concerns of a Maoist spillover into 
India. 
 
4.  (C) Rae also commented on a conversation he recently had 
with the visiting British Ambassador to Nepal, who reportedly 
argued that taking a hard line with the Maoists might not be 
the best way to solve the problem.  Rae said the British 
opinion was that a weakened Maoists position would only make 
them more recalcitrant and less likely to negotiate. Rae said 
that the GOI does not agree with this argument.  He also 
expressed frustration about the continued European reluctance 
to press for a freeze on Maoist assets, calling this 
symptomatic of their naive approach to the violence in Nepal.

1.  (C) Polcouns and Poloff met on November 1 with MEA Joint 
Secretary (Nepal/Bhutan) Ranjit Rae to brief on the strategy 
 
SIPDIS 
recently outlined by King Wangchuck to A/S Dewey to 
repatriate Category 1 refugees from the Khudunabari camp 
(Reftel).  Rae replied that the GOI welcomes this strategy as 
a way break the deadlock, and is hopeful it could dove-tail 
to other solutions to the problem.  He indicated that King 
Wangchuck had described our initiative to the Indian 
delegation during a recent royal investiture ceremony in 
Thimphu and appreciated the early US consultation.  He was 
particularly curious about Nepalese reactions.  Rae mentioned 
in passing that Category 3 refugees from Nepal could also be 
included in the initial plan (in order to remove them from 
the equation), but did not press this point. 
 
2.  (C) GOI has also pressed the GON to allow UNHCR to 
conduct profiling and re-registration surveys, Rae said, but 
Kathmandu remains concerned that this process will lead to 
local integration of large numbers of refugees.  Responding 
to reftel, he indicated that New Delhi would weigh in to 
support the initiative. 
 
3.  (C) The Joint Secretary expressed concern with the 
strategy of having the Nepalese and Bhutanese Ambassadors to 
India draft letters specifying the details of an agreement on 
the grounds that the two have not talked to each other about 
the issue.  The Nepalese Ambassador has not commented 
publicly on refugee matters, and the prior ambassador was 
much more personally involved, said Rae.  The King of Nepal 
will visit New Delhi in late November and might discuss the 
refugee situation with GOI interlocutors during the trip. 
Rae believed the Nepalese King was generally interested in 
resolving the issue, and he might play a role similar to that 
of the King of Bhutan in moving the process forward. 
 
4.  (C)  Concluding, Rae stressed the importance of ensuring 
that the UN, EU and other Friends of Bhutan states do not 
derail the process by harping on the conditions of return and 
other controversial issues.  He urged the US to encourage the 
Europeans and UN to support the process and not to make 
public statements that could cause problems.

1.  (C) Summary:  This is the first of two cables reporting 
on the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) 
Implementation Group.  USG and GOI counterparts met in two 
positive and productive sessions of the NSSP Implementation 
Group on October 20-21 to review accomplishments under Phase 
One and chart the course for Phase Two.  Although there are 
some pending issues we need to resolve -- some contentious 
such as the status of onward proliferation cases -- the GOI 
continues to demonstrate high-level resolve to maintain 
momentum.  Throughout the course of the meetings, both sides 
exchanged forthright views on mutual expectations, and 
defined areas where more information is needed or where 
action is pending.  After reviewing measures the GOI has 
already taken to strengthen its export controls, the Indians 
commented that work is already well-advanced on issues such 
as developing a framework for stronger export controls. 
Considerable effort, however, must be sustained to ensure 
effective implementation such as introducing legislation that 
adequately covers \"intangible\" technology transfers and 
provides for \"catch-all\" controls.  Other issues, such as 
formulation of an Indian missile defense doctrine, remain in 
the beginning stage.  The Indian side agreed to a further 
discussion of Phase Two issues in connection with the 
November 18-19 High-Tech Cooperation Group (HTCG) meeting. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) A/S Rocca led the USG delegation comprised of 
Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, DCM, PolCouns, 
and representatives from the State Department\'s Bureaus for 
South Asia, Non-Proliferation, and Arms Control, the 
Department of Defense, as well as the Science and Customs 
offices at Embassy New Delhi.  With similarly broad 
representation, the GOI delegation was led by MEA Additional 
Secretary for International Security Meera Shankar, with 
 
SIPDIS 
participation from MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. 
Jaishankar, other MEA officials from the Americas and 
Disarmament Divisions as well as representatives from the 
Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Space, and the 
Defense Ministry\'s Defense Research and Development 
Organization (DRDO).  The NSSP Implementation Group meeting 
took place in two sessions, October 20-21.  The following 
cable provides reporting on achievements and pending issues 
from Phase One; reporting on the next steps for Phase Two 
will follow septel.  Because of scheduling constraints, not 
all participants were able to attend all sessions. 
Participant list follows in para 12. 
 
Phase One: Accomplishments and Pending Issues 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In her opening remarks on Phase One, A/S Rocca 
reviewed significant accomplishments:  Removing ISRO from the 
Entity List; removing licensing requirements for certain 
dual-use items exported to Indian Space Research Organization 
(ISRO) subordinates; and expanding the \"presumption of 
approval\" for all dual use items not controlled by the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for \"balance of plant\" 
operations.  She inquired about the GOI response to U/S 
Grossman\'s letter offering the sale of the Patriot PAC-2 
missile defense system and expressed USG desire to continue 
the Strategic Stability Dialogue. 
 
4.  (C) Additional Secretary Shankar began by describing 
India\'s security perimeter as \"stretching from the Straits of 
Malacca to the Gulf and beyond.\"  In addition to the security 
concerns posed by India\'s immediate neighbors, Shankar said 
that proliferation linkages with this region also impinge on 
Indian security.  Chinese proliferation of centrifuge 
technology to Pakistan, for example, and subsequent onward 
proliferation to Libya, North Korea and others also pose 
security risks to India.  Because of the direct impact of 
proliferation on India\'s security, Shankar urged the US to 
share intelligence about proliferation in the region, 
particularly the status of dismantling the AQ Khan network. 
A/S Rocca responded that it may not be possible to provide 
more information at this time without endangering the ongoing 
investigation, but underlined US commitment to dismantle the 
AQ Khan network \"root and branch.\" 
 
Onward Proliferation 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Both sides agreed that it is necessary to determine 
the status of several pending onward proliferation cases. 
Shankar presented eight non-papers outlining the GOI 
investigation of numerous cases raised by the US (Ref A), but 
expressed frustration that current cases are reviewed, new 
ones are added, but old cases never seem to be resolved. 
\"Our agencies want to see the NSSP as forward-looking and 
prospective, not retrospective,\" Shankar said.  Caroline 
Russell, the NP representative, assured Shankar that Indian 
information is carefully considered, but since our goal is to 
have a dialogue, further questions often arise about the 
original situation, if not about GOI action.  As information 
is exchanged, cases can be removed from the list. 
 
6.  (C) After A/S Rocca delivered the demarche points in 
Reftel B regarding Russia\'s transfer of MTCR Category II 
propellant mixers to India\'s ballistic missile program in 
1999, GOI representatives expressed dismay and 
dissatisfaction on several counts (Reftel C).  Beyond their 
reaction to the case itself, Shankar broadened her critique 
by stating the GOI view that conventional weapon issues are 
outside the purview of the NSSP.  \"The US has raised concerns 
about conventional weapons based on your own foreign policy 
and political concerns,\" she said, \"but these concerns are 
best addressed by in our respective Foreign Ministries, not 
the NSSP.\"  \"It seems that you have some discretion in 
interpreting your laws and choosing which cases to raise and 
when,\" she continued.  \"On the case of China providing ring 
magnets to Pakistan,\" for instance, \"despite substantial 
evidence, sanctions were not imposed.\"  Shankar offered two 
non-papers about proliferation to Pakistan (Refs D and E), 
with a request that the US investigate the matters and share 
any resulting information with the GOI. 
 
7.  (C) Turning the tables, Mr. Siddhartha, a consultant to 
MEA and former DRDO official, wanted assurances that the US 
would not allow Indian technology to be passed on to 
Pakistan, as in the case of a mission control computer 
developed in India that could be fitted on an F-16.  He 
predicted that such situations may be more common in the 
future as India\'s technology sector develops. 
 
8.  (C) Finally, Shankar reiterated concerns that information 
the GOI has shared with the US on cases of onward 
proliferation, e.g., NEC, has been shared with other 
governments without GOI consent, possibly endangering cases 
under judicial review.  Russell assured the GOI that the US 
treated the information they provided with the utmost 
confidentiality.   She said she was unaware that any GOI 
 
SIPDIS 
information had been passed on to other governments, but 
noted that the U.S. did on occasion share with other 
countries information from its own sources.  She observed 
that in the NEC case, the subsequent warning issued by the 
German government could have been based on press accounts of 
the public announcement of U.S. sanctions against NEC in 2002. 
 
Sanctioned Scientists 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Returning to the controversial issue of US sanctions 
against two Indian scientists for involvement in Iran\'s WMD 
program (Reftel F), Shankar said the timing of the 
announcement could not have been more unfortunate because \"it 
tarnished the shine of the NSSP.\"  She reiterated the GOI\'s 
oft-stated defense that Dr. Surendra has never been to Iran 
and that Dr. Prasad worked on safety issues at the Bushehr 
nuclear reactor under IAEA auspices.  The sanctions 
determination has raised questions within the GOI about the 
credibility of the NSSP; a decision to drop sanctions would 
consequently bolster confidence among GOI skeptics, according 
to Shankar. 
 
10.  (C) A/S Rocca acknowledged that the timing of these 
penalties was regrettable, but believed the intelligence to 
be solid and stated that the determination would be upheld 
unless the GOI presents new information.  \"We do not share 
your perception of this issue,\" Shankar replied.  A/S Rocca 
responded that it is critical to develop better means of 
communication to ensure that similar cases do not occur in 
the future. 
 
11.  (C) Indicating the depth of GOI resentment on this case, 
Jaishankar again raised the issue of the sanctioned 
scientists on the second day of meetings.  The announcement 
of US penalties against the two eminent scientists \"played 
badly in the media, but much worse in-house,\" he said. 
Citing an article about the case in the local press the day 
before, he predicted, \"We will keep getting hammered on this 
(until the decision is reversed).\"  He went on to say that he 
is \"personally aggrieved\" by the way the announcement was 
handled.  Recalling that a State Department official 
contacted him by cell phone in a restaurant in DC to discuss 
an issue related to the IAEA debate in Vienna, he expressed 
dismay that no one in Washington tried to contact him about 
this issue of great concern to New Delhi.

cybersecurity organizations, and in India\'s technical 
capabilities.  Markoff remarked on the successful 
ITAA-NASSCOM India-US Information Security Summit 2004, at 
which she delivered the closing keynote address.  Both 
Washington and New Delhi emphasized the importance of 
including the perspectives of both software developers and 
clients.  Markoff listed a few key industries that rely 
heavily on secure and reliable IT systems: banks, health 
care, utilities, and transportation.  Observing that the 
issue of cybersecurity is no longer \"in the weeds,\" she said 
it is now recognized as an important part of US-India 
interdependence that is larger than the IT sector. 
 
WG1: Legal Cooperation and Law Enforcement 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) Markoff began by listing topics the USG wants to 
discuss in the area of cybersecurity legal cooperation and 
law enforcement: 
 
-- How the GOI is organized to fight cybercrime; 
-- Updates on relevant legislation; 
-- Any plans to facilitate a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
for computer crime; 
-- The Council of Europe model cybercrime legislation; 
-- How Indian law enforcement agencies approach cybercrime 
investigations and prosecutions; and 
-- If India participates in, or plans to participate in, the 
24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network. 
 
4.  (SBU) Arguing for the inclusion of intrusion detection of 
Indian infrastructure to the agenda, MHA Joint Secretary 
Renuka Muttoo recalled a recent incident in which an American 
criminal/hacker allegedly misused an Indian proxy server to 
engage in credit card fraud and the printing of fraudulent 
certificates.  Noting that the incident was reported to the 
US DOJ, she asked how such reporting could be 
institutionalized. Markoff indicated that the 24/7 Cybercrime 
Point of Contact Network, of which India was already a 
member, was the conduit for cyber crime reporting.  Muttoo 
appeared unfamiliar with the 24/7 POC cybercrime network and 
Markoff promised to provide the name of the GOI contact. 
(NOTE: Embassy later passed GOI contact information via MEA.) 
 
5.  (SBU) Gupta queried whether this 24/7 network would be 
used to report all cyber incidents.  Markoff indicated that 
the U.S. has set up two separate 24/7 POCs -- one for watch 
and warning information sharing (US-CERT/NCSD), the other for 
law enforcement cooperation (DOJ) -- as a more effective way 
to ensure that information flows between professionals who 
understand each others priorities.  Of course, the US and 
Indian CERTs would also pass crime-relevant information to 
appropriate law enforcement contacts within their respective 
countries should they receive it. 
 
6.  (SBU) Gupta indicated that the U.S. had not been 
responsive to all past bilateral requests for law enforcement 
cooperation.  Markoff suggested that Gupta supply a list of 
unanswered requests.  It would be useful for the CSF to 
review India\'s status in cybercrime substantive law (what 
activities are criminalized) as well as cybercrime procedural 
law (how far Indian authorities are allowed to cooperate on 
cross-border incidents).  As an example, Markoff described a 
possible intrusion that could be routed through servers in 
several countries; in trying to trace back an attack, any gap 
in bilateral cybercrime cooperation would stop the 
investigation dead in its tracks. 
 
7.  (SBU) Gupta mentioned that the range of Indian law 
enforcement agencies with a potential role in cybercrime 
enforcement was larger than the delegation they could bring 
to the CSF, and offered to host a joint cybercrime law 
enforcement workshop in early 2005.  He envisioned a two-day 
workshop that would look at problems and possible 
collaboration in cyber-forensics, mutual legal assistance, 
and computer-based investigation, noting that this could be 
another venue for private industry to join the 
government-to-government dialogue.  Markoff responded that 
DOJ has participated in similar workshops, and suggested the 
proposal be discussed further at the CSF.  Gupta said that 
the issue could also be pursued in the Law Enforcement Joint 
Working Group, and that the GOI Department of Information 
Technology had already held one working group on cyber law 
and cyber-crime. 
 
8.  (SBU) Gupta requested that DOJ brief on how high-tech 
crime is pursued, \"from the start, conducting the 
investigation, through convictions, a complete walk-through\" 
at the November CSF.  Gupta\'s deputy, Commander Mukesh Saini, 
suggested that DOJ\'s Websnare Operation could be a useful 
case to profile. 
 
WG2: Research and Development 
----------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Markoff asked that India\'s Working Group 2 
delegation report how New Delhi is poised for and can foster 
critical infrastructure protection research and development, 
outreach to industry and academia on CIP, and what 
cybersecurity issues the GOI sought to underline.  She told 
Gupta that the InfoSec Research Council prepared a \"Hard 
Problems List\" of the technical hurdles in cybersecurity that 
need to be overcome (NOTE: Embassy later delivered a copy of 
the \"Hard Problems List\" to Saini).  Markoff suggested that 
the USG and the GOI might partner in resolving some of these 
problems. 
 
10.  (SBU) In response, Gupta asked if the India-US Science 
and Technology Forum, which began in March 2000, might be a 
more appropriate venue for new R&D workshops in 
cybersecurity.  In such an eventuality, the S&TF could 
provide POCs for science collaboration in several research 
areas, such as systems-oriented research architecture for 
dependability and survivability, systems 
management/monitoring/control, human monitoring, 
authentication, communications protocols, network security, 
accountability, and foundational research (logical languages 
and tools to develop systems).  The most promising areas, 
Gupta said, were in applying cryptography for authentication 
and privacy, language-based security (i.e. voice 
recognition), diverse redundancy, and catastrophe-resistant 
architecture. 
 
11.  (SBU) Department of Information Technology Senior 
Director S. Basu said that working-level GOI R&D interests 
are focused on cryptography and crypto-analysis, network 
systems security, security architecture, operating system 
security, vulnerability detection and monitoring, and 
cyber-forensics.  He expressed interest in reviewing the 
\"Hard Problems List.\"  Basu added that proposed topics for 
collaboration could include cyber forensic tools, 
authentication, speaker (voice) recognition, cryptography, 
and quantum cryptography. 
 
12.  (SBU) Dr. G. Athithan of the Defense Research and 
Development Organization (DRDO)/Center for Artificial 
Intelligence and Robotics said that DRDO and DIT had been 
working on IT security for 3-4 years.  They have access to 
software developers in Bangalore through the marriage of 
\"government money and private sector brains,\" while critical 
tasks are handled by government-funded laboratories, which 
also conduct field-testing.  Athithan underlined the GOI 
desire for tools to help monitor network traffic and capture 
keywords.  He remarked that intercepting and reading 
Internet-based e-mail (webmail) was a difficult problem, and 
that webmail was developed by an Indian programmer to 
sidestep firewalls because it was more difficult to detect. 
After Athithan expressed his interest in \"carnivore\" software 
(to allow law enforcement agencies to read intercepted 
e-mails) Markoff and Bloechl -- as well as Gupta and Saini -- 
steered the conversation toward possible cooperation on 
cracking packet header data and session information, and away 
from reading intercepted text.  Athithan proffered additional 
GOI R&D priorities: intrusion detection, modeling 
statistically normal network behavior to create a baseline, 
hacker tracing, and, again, viewing electronic content, \"to 
help infer the origin and identity of an attacker.\" 
 
13.  (SBU) Gupta suggested Internet traffic monitoring and 
database analysis as areas for possible cooperation, noting 
that the GOI wishes to be able to profile and summarize data 
and databases, as well as profiling online user sessions 
(e-mail traffic and clustered browsing) over multi-day 
periods.  Gupta then asked how the US monitors Internet 
traffic.  Markoff said that US law does not permit general 
monitoring of Internet traffic; instead, if there is evidence 
of a crime, a court order can permit law enforcement to 
investigate relevant e-mail traffic. 
 
14.  (SBU) Bloechl suggested that the defense cooperation 
working group could discuss the issue in a military context, 
and echoed Markoff\'s statement that the USG does not monitor 
content, instead focusing on analysis, such as the case of 
worms or viruses indicated by packet header data.  He 
explained that there is a great need to avoid violating US 
law by collecting information on US persons outside of a 
sanctioned law enforcement investigation. 
 
15.  (SBU) Gupta shared that the GOI,s interest was not in 
reading the data itself, but in technology to warehouse and 
analyze it.  The GOI was interested in unclassified 
technology, as classified data is handled under separate 
procedures.  Athithan interjected that he was interested in 
R&D, not law enforcement, and that the technology would be 
deployed toward a watch and warning function that would be in 
place prior to any legal permissions being sought for 
attempted intrusion or attack.  He restated his interests as 
summarizing and profiling data, traffic analysis, and cluster 
analysis; Gupta added that the Indo-US Counterterrorism Joint 
Working Group was the appropriate forum for tools that would 
support actionable intelligence, while Athithan pushed for 
the technology to implement watch, warning and emergency 
response functions, as well as handling and storing digital 
evidence. 
 
WG3: Critical Infrastructure Protection 
--------------------------------------- 
 
16.  (SBU) Markoff told Gupta that the Acting Director of 
DHS\'s National Cyber Security Division, Andy Purdy, will 
co-chair the Third Working Group, and will lead on watch and 
warning issues.  Its presentation will include an overview of 
the capabilities and activities of the US Computer Emergency 
Readiness Team (US-CERT, which NCSD oversees), its mandated 
mission, its watch-and-warning capabilities, and a review of 
its public/private/academic/international outreach and 
partnerships.  The USG sought a reciprocal briefing on the 
capabilities and activities of India\'s CERT-In.  The working 
group will also explore collaboration opportunities, and 
welcomed a discussion on the following issues: 
 
-- How was CERT-In created? 
-- What is its mandate? 
-- What alert and advisory systems are in place? 
-- Is CERT-In operating in a 24/7 capacity for emergency 
responses?  If not, will it do so in the future? 
-- What kinds of international outreach does CERT-In pursue? 
 
17.  (SBU) Markoff then listed some potential avenues for 
collaboration between the two CERTs: 
 
-- Designating POCs for bilateral communications; 
-- Coordinating on cybersecurity incident responses; 
-- Partnering on hard issues such as attribution and software 
assurance; 
-- Sharing watch and warning information; 
-- Fostering international cooperation beyond the bilateral 
relationship; and 
-- Technical training assistance. 
 
Other possibilities include exchanges of periodic reports on 
global Internet status, including trends, vulnerabilities, 
and incidents. 
 
18.  (SBU) Markoff reported that the USG has been considering 
architecture for an incident alert and management system, and 
is consulting with other allies in this regard.  The system 
would need to have real-time warning capabilities.  Because 
CERT-In is India\'s designated national CERT, the two teams 
could begin sharing basic cyber watch and warning information 
almost immediately, she added.  Markoff explained that 
CERT-In must be the government\'s authorized CERT and be able 
to share reciprocal information with US-CERT on a 24/7 basis, 
to qualify for this level of partnership. 
 
19.  (SBU) CERT-In Operations Manager Anil Sagar briefly 
presented on CERT-In\'s capabilities.  He stated that CERT-In 
is GOI funded, 24/7 capable, and provides both pull (website: 
http://www.cert-in.org.in) and push (e-mail) alert services. 
He confirmed that it is the GOI-designated national CERT for 
all computer security incidents, government and 
private-sector, and has been operating since January.  In 
response to Markoff\'s query as to CERT-In\'s membership in any 
regional agreements, Sagar said that CERT-In Director Dr. KK 
Bajaj was at that time engaged in membership consultations 
for the Asia-Pacific CERT (APCERT).  CERT-In,s \"wish list,\" 
according to Sagar, includes: 
 
-- Knowledge-sharing with US-CERT of any discovered operating 
systems or applications vulnerabilities, 
-- Updates on viruses and worms in circulation; 
-- Assistance in vulnerability analysis; 
-- Capabilities of incident handling; 
-- Traffic monitoring; 
-- Intrusion trends and warnings; 
-- Hacker profiling; and 
-- Assistance in testing patches for upcoming software 
vulnerabilities (NOTE: Sagar explained that CERT-In tests 
commercially-available patches before posting them on their 
website, because, he explained, they are very careful about 
preserving CERT-In,s reputation and do not wish to be 
associated with faulty patches.) 
 
20.  (SBU) In exchange, Sagar said that CERT-In could share 
the following with US-CERT: best practices on systems 
hardening; co-development of security applications; and 
information-sharing on systems vulnerabilities information. 
 
WG4: Defense Cooperation 
------------------------ 
 
21.  (SBU) Bloechl explained that robust cybersecurity for 
the US Defense Department and the military is already in 
place, under the auspices of a four-star general at US 
Strategic Command.  A Joint Task Force (JTF) was created in 
1998 as the primary computer network defense organization for 
the Defense Department.  Other agency and military CERTs 
report to it, and it works in parallel with the US-CERT under 
the Department of Homeland Security as its defense sector 
counterpart.  Bloechl invited the Working Group 4 delegation 
to visit the CSF early and tour the JTF/Global Network 
Operations Center in Washington, at which time the two 
delegations could discuss common goals and objectives for 
bilateral cooperation.  Of key importance, he stressed, is 
that any organization the DOD partners with must be able to 
protect the information on its own networks. 
 
22.  (SBU) Bloechl then asked about the status of India\'s 
military CERT -- whether it has 24/7 intrusion detection, an 
R&D budget, details about its network security and if the 
military uses simulation modeling to test the security, 
indicators and warning capability, and pre-attack warning 
capability.  Saini responded that each service (Army, Navy, 
Air Force) currently maintains its own independent computer 
networks, each overseen by its own \"semblance of a CERT.\" 
Over time Saini planned to \"grow the existing CERTs until 
they are fully functioning,\" primarily by enlarging and 
training their staffs, a goal he hopes to reach by 2007.  Not 
even the Integrated Defense Staff yet possesses an integrated 
network -- the stress is to have adequate security in place 
before linking networks even at the IDS level.  Furthermore, 
beyond the three service networks, the military has only a 
relatively small number of separate, Internet-accessible 
workstations.  Despite pressure from within the military to 
expand Internet access, especially leading to broadband 
access, Saini\'s preference was to do so only after the 
military CERTs are fully functioning. 
 
23.  (SBU) Commodore J Jena of India\'s Integrated Defense 
Staff, who introduced himself by saying that \"cybersecurity 
is my main activity,\" said the need for an expanded awareness 
of cybersecurity within the Indian military\'s Intranets 
remained acute.  He asked whether USG networks were secured 
with commercially-available products or were manufactured 
within the government.  Bloechl responded that classified 
systems are secured by USG agencies, including the NSA.  Jena 
then asked what algorithms US classified networks use, and 
how reliable they are considered to be.  Bloechl took the 
question and will pass to appropriate US offices for 
potential future action. 
 
24.  (SBU) In exchange for US-funded cybersecurity training, 
Jena said the Indian military was prepared to share the 
following with the US: 
 
-- Counterterrorism/low intensity conflict training and 
expertise; 
-- A mode to tap into India\'s pool of IT talent; and 
-- Its share in a bilateral cyberwarning function. 
 
25.  (SBU) Jena asked about adding additional areas to the 
discussion agenda, such as using endochromatic radioactive 
material-embedded hardware and software for security, cyber 
deterrence, and how to test for and sanitize malicious code. 
Markoff and Bloechl answered that the key to deterrence is 
cracking the attribution problem.  After Jena asked about 
hardening systems to withstand an electro-magnetic pulse and 
how to reconstitute after such an attack, Markoff advised 
that such issues might be better addressed in the CTJWG. 
Bloechl added that some elements in DOD might be looking at 
such problems, but not his office.  Bloechl and Jena agreed 
that data in languages other than English posed a hard 
problem, one that Markoff said was recognized at the World 
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). 
 
WG5: Standards and Software Assurance 
------------------------------------- 
 
26.  (SBU) Markoff opened discussion on Working Group 5 by 
stating that Dr. Ron Ross of NIST would provide the CSF with 
a high-level overview of NIST\'s guidelines on security 
standards; show how the standards have international 
applicability; and outline the benefits of ongoing 
collaboration.  Dr. SL Sarnot (Director General, 
Standards/Testing/Quality Certification Directorate, Ministry 
of Communications and Information Technology) stated that he 
had held a prior discussion with Dr. Ross, on common criteria 
for software assurance, and that both sides of the working 
group should be able to work well together.  The GOI would 
seek cooperation in implementing NIST assurance protocols, 
and Sarnot said the US document is more \"elaborate\" than 
India\'s current program.  He also asked for assistance in 
assurance frameworks and training to implement the common 
framework. 
 
A Role for Private Industry 
--------------------------- 
 
27.  (SBU) Markoff and Gupta agreed that if the private 
sector and industry associations participate in the CSF, they 
would be included in the plenaries and could make their own 
presentations in that venue.  Markoff suggested that in 
addition to IT industry representation, IT clients and firms 
involved in critical infrastructure (banking, 
telecommunications, utilities, and transportation, for 
example) should be invited.  The delegation need not be huge, 
but American firms want to engage with their Indian 
counterparts, to foster deeper relations, but with a 
government component as the framework to facilitate an 
industry-to-industry dialogue, she stated.  Gupta replied 
that the 2004 NASSCOM-ITAA conference had set the stage, and 
cybersecurity awareness has risen dramatically since the 2002 
CSF.  Markoff observed that the private sector must be part 
of the solution, as states cannot legislate strong 
cybersecurity protections into existence. 
 
28.  (SBU) Gupta observed that once private firms realize how 
much business will be tied to firms that work in a secure 
environment, they might end up pressuring governments into 
action.  A few years ago there was marked resistance to 
adopting the common criteria for software assurance, he said, 
but now \"all objections are gone.\"  Many firms are only now 
beginning to understand the difference between information 
technology and information security.  Markoff replied that as 
more firms lose productivity and business through 
cyber-attacks, worms, viruses, etc., fewer will require 
convincing. 
 
29.  (SBU) Markoff said that US industry participation would 
be based in part on the Indian list.  She also offered that 
there could be sector-based break-out sessions for the 
commercial delegates.  Specifically, Markoff said US firms 
would like to have Indian companies like TATA, WIPRO, and 
InfoSys represented, as well as national universities and 
research laboratories.  Gupta promised to forward an Indian 
private-sector list, but cautioned that if they were unable 
to form a good delegation, they may rely on CII or NASSCOM 
representatives who could then report back to their members. 
 
30.  (SBU) Markoff suggested a list of possible issues and 
topics that would interest private industry, and that private 
sector participants could brief on: 
 
-- E-signatures; 
-- Bilateral certification authority; 
-- Security procedures; 
-- Technical and language skills; 
-- Outsourcing; 
-- Business activity disruption/disaster recovery; 
-- Help desk/call center operations; 
-- E-security with handheld devices; 
-- Cybercrime laws; 
-- Enforcement of privacy laws/standards; 
-- Data privacy (including why India does not need to adopt 
the EU Privacy Law); 
-- Need to enforce IPR; 
-- Data protection laws; 
-- Online database protection; 
-- Physical security, including biometrics and closed circuit 
monitoring; 
-- GPS issues; 
-- Public safety concerns; 
-- Outreach to small and mid-sized firms; and 
-- Protecting financial data. 
 
Site Visits 
----------- 
 
31.  (SBU) Markoff, Bloechl and Gupta agreed that appropriate 
site visits would be of great value.  Bloechl suggested that 
the defense WG could visit the Joint Task Force on November 
8, before the plenary.  Markoff added that a visit to US-CERT 
could also be planned for some of the other working groups. 
Both parties agreed that site visits would take place on 
November 8, on the basis of a list of sites the Indian 
delegation would like to visit. 
 
Training Requests and Funding 
----------------------------- 
 
32.  (SBU) The most important item on New Delhi\'s training 
agenda is capacity building, Gupta reported.  He emphasized 
the desire for expert exchanges and hands-on, side-by-side 
training.  Admitting that funding, scheduling, and logistics 
for sending Indian cybersecurity professionals to the US were 
issues that needed to be worked out, Gupta offered to host 
American cybersecurity experts \"for three days, or two 
months, or more\" at Indian cybersecurity facilities and 
classes.  Markoff and Gupta agreed that this would be a good 
issue for the CSF working groups to firm up.  When Gupta 
pressed for working exchanges and hands-on training for 
CERT-In personnel at US-CERT, or vice versa, Bloechl 
cautioned him that most of the military CERTs, operations 
are at the top secret level, though there might be 
opportunities to observe operations at lower classifications. 
 
 
33.  (SBU) The US and Indian delegations briefly reviewed the 
September 3 GOI request for cyber forensics training (Ref A). 
When Gupta asked about funding, Markoff responded that there 
were few options due to budget constraints.  She remarked 
that there may be opportunities, however, and noted that INL 
had funded training in Mumbai in 2003, but there is no clear 
answer yet on USG funding for non-military cybersecurity 
training.  Markoff, Bloechl, Saini and Jena discussed the 
possibilities and limitations of funding via IMET, FMS and 
the DOD CT Fellowship Program.  Markoff reported that several 
military training facilities that offer the kinds of courses 
the GOI sought now qualify for IMET.  Markoff also suggested 
that the Monterey Naval Postgraduate School could customize 
senior-level courses for GOI groups.  ODC Maj. Greg Winston 
added that Mobile Training Teams were another option, which 
could be brought to India under defense cooperation programs. 
 He added that some IT-related courses are now covered under 
IMET.  Two important hurdles, however, were that India\'s 
total IMET allocation for 2005 will be $1.4 million, and that 
courses must be at least five weeks in duration.  Both 
delegations agreed to continue the discussion in Washington. 
 
Lobbying for 24/7 Cybercrime POC Resolution 
------------------------------------------- 
 
34.  (SBU) Markoff asked Gupta for GOI support for a 
US-drafted UNGA resolution calling for all UN Member States 
to join the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network 
originally created by the G-8.  She said it would be the 
fifth resolution on cybersecurity.  Gupta reacted positively 
and asked for a copy of the draft resolution.  (NOTE: Embassy 
forwarded the draft resolution via the MEA.) 
 
GOI\'s Cybersecurity Vision 
-------------------------- 
 
35.  (SBU) Gupta\'s short-term vision for GOI,s cybersecurity 
posture is to have dedicated cybersecurity officers in all 
government sectors capable of handling all ministry-related 
aspects of cybersecurity, whether a cyber attack occurs 
within a ministry or in the private sector areas the ministry 
oversees.  This platform would then grow to include a fully 
functioning CERT for each sector, with all reporting to and 
deriving training from CERT-In.  Gupta acknowledged that a 
dearth of trained personnel was slowing progress, which was 
the impetus behind what he called \"inculcating a culture of 
cybersecurity into the private sector,\" first by mandating a 
cybersecurity requirement in engineering college curricula. 
Saini elaborated that he would like to see cybersecurity 
training represent 5 percent of education within the IT 
sector, up from his estimate of 0.01 percent, by 2008. 
Eventually, he hoped that every IT professional would 
consider cybersecurity to be part of his bailiwick.  Saini 
acknowledged that this would represent a massive investment 
by both the government and private industry, and that it 
would have to be a joint effort and not two parallel tracks. 
 
High-Level Policy Support 
------------------------- 
 
36.  (SBU) Noting that cybersecurity enjoys high-level 
support from NSA Dixit, chairman of the National Information 
Board (NIB) which keeps cybersecurity as a top-level policy 
interest, Gupta described the NIB as \"very big,\" comprising 
MEA, MHA, Finance, MOD, DIT, the economic sectoral 
ministries, and law enforcement agencies.  It meets every 
three months. 
 
Other Cybersecurity Relationships Pale In Comparison 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
37.  (SBU) Gupta said that although cybersecurity is clearly 
an issue of international importance, the Indo-US CSF is New 
Delhi\'s only substantial bilateral cybersecurity 
relationship.  There had been some efforts at cooperation 
with Canada and Israel, \"but they never took off.\"  He also 
dismissed GOI efforts to foment cybersecurity cooperation 
with Russia without elaborating on them. 
 
CSF Framework 
------------- 
 
38.  (SBU) Markoff and Gupta agreed on the following 
structure for the five working groups and their co-chairs as 
follows: 
 
Working Group 1: Legal Cooperation and Law Enforcement.  USG 
co-chair Anthony Teelucksingh (Computer Crime and 
Intellectual Property Section, DOJ), GOI co-chair Ms. Renuka 
Muttoo, Joint Director, Ministry of Home Affairs. 
 
Working Group 2: Research and Development.  USG co-chair Stan 
Riveles (Office of the S&T Advisor to the Secretary), GOI 
co-chair Dr. AK Chakravarti (Advisor, Department of 
Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and 
Information Technology) (NOTE: The GOI co-chair was later 
changed to Dr. N Sitaram, Director Defense Research and 
Development Organization (DRDO)/Center for Artificial 
Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR)  END NOTE.). 
 
Working Group 3: Critical Infrastructure Protection, Watch, 
Warning, and Emergency Response.  USG co-chair Andy Purdy 
(DHS National Cyber Security Division), GOI co-chair Dr. KK 
Bajaj (Director/CERT-In). (NOTE: \"Emergency Response\" was 
added to working group name to facilitate Bajaj\'s 
participation.  END NOTE.) 
 
Working Group 4: Defense Cooperation.  USG co-chair Tim 
Bloechl (DOD Director of International Information Assurance 
Programs), GOI co-chair Mr. SK Sharma (Joint Secretary, 
Ministry of Defense). 
 
Working Group 5: Standards.  USG co-chair Dr. Ron Ross 
(NIST), GOI co-chair Dr. SL Sarnot (Director General, 
Standards/Testing/Quality Certification Directorate, Ministry 
of Communications and Information Technology). 
 
39.  (SBU) The two-day government-to-government forum was 
tentatively agreed to be structured as follows: 
 
-- 11/9 morning: A comprehensive plenary session with all 
delegates attending.  Working groups give short presentations 
of key challenges and accomplishments in their fields. 
-- 11/9 afternoon: Plenary continues.  Working groups 
continue their briefings. 
-- 11/10 morning: Working groups break out into separate 
meetings. 
-- 11/10 afternoon: Plenary reconvenes for lunch.  Working 
groups report progress and road maps outlining next steps. 
Prepare joint statement.

SUBJECT: LOOKING AHEAD TO ASEAN: INDIA ENGAGES EAST ASIA 
 
REF: A. NEWDELHI 6983 
     B. NEWDELHI 6472 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The GOI has engaged actively with East Asian 
capitals prior to the November 30 ASEAN Plus One Summit in 
Laos.  India\'s two-track approach to these 
states--multilaterally through organizations like ASEAN, and 
bilaterally--exemplifies New Delhi\'s strategy of expanding 
economic and geographic horizons, with a wary eye on China. 
Heading to Laos with Plus One status, India\'s Prime Minister 
Singh will look to assert India\'s significance beyond South 
Asia.  We see competition with China as a growing factor in 
India\'s ASEAN calculus.  End Summary. 
 
Two-Pronged Approach 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (C) India\'s approach towards East Asia is \"two-pronged\" 
with both multilateral and bilateral tracks, according to 
Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses researcher Deba 
Mohanty.  While pursuing bilateral cooperation such as 
preferential trade agreements (PTA), India works 
multilaterally through organizations such as BIMSTEC and 
ASEAN, he explained.  The GOI is proceeding \"incrementally,\" 
he said, courting only select countries, at first 
economically, and then politically. 
 
Recent Bilaterals: Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, Japan 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.  (C) In October, senior GOI officials visited and hosted 
officials from a number of East Asian countries.  South 
Korean President Roh Moo-hyun traveled to New Delhi October 
4-6, at the conclusion of which, the two countries signed a 
joint statement detailing cooperation in security, trade, and 
UNSC reform (Ref B).  Earning a second Bangkok stamp in his 
passport in less than six months, FM Natwar Singh stopped in 
Thailand on October 14, enroute to Hanoi.  While India has 
deepening economic ties with Thailand, such as the nascent 
PTA, there are also geostrategic components to India\'s 
interests in that country.  According to JNU Professor of 
South East Asian studies Manmohini Kaul, Thailand encouraged 
the GOI to engage Burma ahead of Than Shwe\'s Delhi trip. 
 
4.  (C) FM Singh\'s trip to Vietnam October 15-18 was less 
significant in strategic terms, Kaul continued, describing 
that relationship as more \"historical.\"  The FM also made an 
effort to secure one more handshake in support of India\'s bid 
for permanent membership in the UNSC.  The IDSA\'s Mohanty 
noted that India sees Vietnam as a big market, but also as a 
\"strategic balance between China and East Asia,\" which has 
resulted in \"low level discomfort\" in Beijing. 
 
5.  (C) Burmese military leader Than Shwe\'s October 24-29 
visit to India was important in the context of Burma\'s 
position as India\'s gateway to East Asia (Ref A).  Mohanty 
observed that \"Look East\" began with Burma.  India will also 
follow a \"two track policy,\" there of not alienating the 
government for economic reasons, but will attempt to \"create 
space for democracy.\"  Following the Japanese Foreign 
Minister\'s visit to New Delhi this summer, a Parliamentary 
delegation lead by Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee 
traveled to Japan from October 31 to November 6 and met with 
Japanese officials including PM Junichiro Koizumi.  The 
Japanese Embassy called the visit an attempt to \"resuscitate 
Parliamentary exchanges,\" supporting Mohanty\'s observation 
that India is trying to \"renew ties with Japan in a big way,\" 
after the relationship flatlined following India\'s 1998 
nuclear tests. 
 
Multilateral Prong: ASEAN 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The GOI\'s recent bilateral exchanges with East Asia 
complement its outreach to ASEAN as an institution.  Prior to 
Natwar Singh\'s departure for Bangkok and Hanoi, the MEA 
observed that Vietnam is part of ASEAN and India-Vietnam 
relations \"have coincided with developments in India-ASEAN 
relations.\"  Looking ahead to November\'s ASEAN Plus One 
Summit in Laos, Kaul said that despite India\'s early 
reservations about the organization because of conflicts with 
its historical non-aligned orientation, India appreciates its 
ASEAN Plus One designation as recognition of New Delhi\'s 
importance on par with the ASEAN Plus Three countries (South 
Korea, Japan, and China).  Professor Kaul noted that the Plus 
One designation may be an attempt to stave off India, as few 
ASEAN members support India\'s fuller membership in the 
grouping. 
 
China vs. India: Heavyweight Matchup 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) Our interlocutors stress the growing importance of 
China in India\'s calculations with respect to East Asia. 
Professor Kaul observed that East Asian leaders encourage 
India\'s greater involvement as a \"balance\" to China\'s growing 
influence: \"other countries know that only India can stand up 
to China.\"  The IDSA\'s Mohanty put it more simply: \"the 
reason for \"Look East\" is China,\" even though it is a two-way 
exchange.  India, concerned about Chinese encroachment into 
neighboring countries, such as Burma, is eager to insert 
itself into East Asia.  While the dominant view here is of 
the two Asian giants butting heads strategically, Mohanty 
commented that CT interests could bring India and China 
together.  Asked why India has not been invited to join the 
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a CT grouping of 
China\'s creating, Mohanty said India is still unsure of 
Beijing\'s intentions with the SCO. 
 
8.  (C) Professor Kaul noted that India was welcome in East 
Asia because New Delhi \"has not given any indication of 
having big brotherly or hegemonistic intentions.\"  The 
difference between China and India in East Asia, she added, 
is that while \"India makes announcements, China is striding 
ahead.\"  As an example she offered the much touted but as yet 
non-existent Thailand, Burma, India highway, and asked 
rhetorically, \"who will travel on it?\"  Mohanty observed that 
India will downplay the China factor in its \"Look East\" 
policy in favor of plugging economic initiatives. 
 
The UPA\'s Eastern Impetus 
------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Professor Kaul observed that the GOI has a Look 
Easter in the PMO\'s office in the form of Media Adviser 
Sanjay Baru who is known to be a strong proponent of BIMSTEC 
(the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Economic 
Cooperation).  She argued that Baru would help to reinforce 
the government\'s East Asia emphasis. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) Strengthening India\'s relations with East Asia 
presents New Delhi with an opportunity to assert its 
interests both economically and strategically, in a region 
where its motivations are not yet perceived as \"big 
brotherly.\"  This contrasts with the sense among India\'s 
immediate South Asian neighbors that New Delhi\'s intentions 
are over-bearing, if not hegemonistic.  As India is already 
recognized as the big player in South Asia, strategic 
concerns vis-a-vis China are less salient.  PM Manmohan 
Singh\'s immediate thrust at the ASEAN Plus One Summit is 
likely to be economic, as India beefs up its regional 
profile, but this will also be an opportunity for the 
little-traveled PM to engage with a broader cross-section of 
East and Southeast Asian leaders as he continues to define 
the Congress vision for international relations.

1.  (C) Summary:  After reviewing achievements made under 
Phase One (Ref A), the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership 
(NSSP) Implementation Group discussed the way forward on 
Phase Two, including legislation, enforcement, outreach, and 
training to strengthen export controls; adherence to MCTR and 
NSG Guidelines; nuclear safety; space cooperation; and 
missile defense.  The Indians commented that work is already 
well-advanced on issues such as developing a framework for 
stronger export controls.  Considerable effort, however, must 
be sustained to ensure effective implementation such as 
introducing legislation that adequately covers \"intangible\" 
technology transfers and provides for \"catch-all\" controls. 
Other issues, such as formulation of an Indian missile 
defense doctrine, remain in the beginning stage.  The Indian 
side agreed to a further discussion of Phase Two issues in 
connection with the November 18-19 High-Tech Cooperation 
Group (HTCG) meeting.  See para 21 for a GOI-drafted list of 
issues for follow-up by the GOI and USG.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) A/S Rocca led the USG delegation comprised of 
Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, DCM, PolCouns, 
and representatives from the State Department\'s Bureaus for 
South Asia, Non-Proliferation, and Arms Control, the 
Department of Defense, as well as the Science and Customs 
offices at Embassy New Delhi.  With similarly broad 
representation, the GOI delegation was led by MEA Additional 
Secretary for International Security Meera Shankar, with 
 
SIPDIS 
participation from MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. 
Jaishankar, other MEA officials from the Americas and 
Disarmament Divisions as well as representatives from the 
Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Space, and the 
Defense Ministry\'s Defense Research and Development 
Organization (DRDO).  Because of scheduling constraints, not 
all participants were able to attend all sessions. 
Participant list follows in para 21. 
 
Ongoing End-User Verification 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In the October 21 session of the Implementation Group 
meeting, Joint Secretary Jaishankar expressed the GOI desire 
to respond in a timely manner to the end-user verification 
requests which Commerce U/S Juster gave the GOI on October 11 
(Reftel B), but requested better information on the following 
issues: 
 
-- Better contact information for the companies, e.g., name 
of specific subsidiary, location, etc.  (He noted the GOI 
used to receive this information regularly in the past); 
 
-- Purchase reference numbers to allow cases to be 
cross-checked between the Indian and US sytems; 
 
-- An indicative list of what information the US requires for 
post-shipment verification; 
 
-- Information about Indian license requests that have been 
denied in order to have a better understanding of what is 
acceptable; 
 
-- A contact person for export issues.  (Note: New 
MEA/Americas Under Secretary Raj Srivastava will be the GOI 
POC and Embassy New Delhi expects a DOC export attache to 
arrive shortly.) 
 
--  Amendment of the footnote to Commerce\'s missile catch-all 
regulation, citing India\'s missile program as an entity of 
concern. 
 
4.  (C) Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration Matthew Borman responded that a number of 
these requests can be accommodated and some, such as the 
request for purchase numbers, will need review.  On amending 
the missile catch-all footnote, Borman said the amendment has 
not yet been published, but said he expected the rule, 
including removal of the missile footnote, to be published 
the week of October 25. 
 
Phase 2: GOI Steps on Legislation, Enforcement, Outreach, 
Training 
-------- ------------------------ ------------- 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C) On strengthening the legislative framework for export 
controls, Russell noted that UNSCR 1540 calls on all 
countries to adopt the same kind of export control laws and 
practices that are outlined in the NSSP.   Shankar expressed 
confidence in the GOI system of export controls, but stressed 
that the resources India devotes to controls for high-tech 
goods should be proportional to its trade in that area, which 
she described as \"infinitesimal.\"  She noted that the GOI has 
other government priorities and that steps taken need to be 
reasonable given resource constraints.  Shankar presented a 
non-paper on \"India\'s System of Controls Over Exports of 
Dual-Use Materials, Equipment and Technology\" (Reftel C). 
 
6.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar outlined the 
ongoing process of strengthening GOI export controls through 
legislative, policy, and administrative modifications. 
Legislative amendments include revising the Customs and 
Finance Acts to make violations punishable by imprisonment. 
Shankar offered to share GOI draft legislation, pending 
appropriate internal clearances.  Policy changes include 
mandatory licensing for export, re-export, and transit of all 
\"Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and 
Technologies\" (SCOMET) items, including damaged, defective, 
or used items; controls on intangible technology related to 
SCOMET items; and a \"catch all\" provision which affords the 
GOI latitude in interpreting which dual-use items may be used 
for suspect activities.  Administrative controls include 
better inter-ministerial coordination through high-level and 
working-level groups. 
 
7.  (C) As the GOI strengthens export controls, Shankar 
relayed private sector concern that new regulations would 
obstruct business, not proliferation.  Russell noted that all 
countries face this concern but offered that governments such 
as Hong Kong, which have tightened controls, have found that 
high tech trade has flourished, boosted by confidence that 
only legitimate businesses would be willing to operate in a 
regulated business environment. 
 
Preventive Enforcement 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Acknowledging India\'s basic legal framework governing 
export controls, A/S Rocca also suggested four areas in need 
of enhanced legislation and enforcement:  intangible 
technology transfers, brokering, transit and re-export, and 
\"catch-all\" controls.  DAS Borman gave the GOI a non-paper 
with suggestions for ways to strengthen GOI preventive 
enforcement capabilities. 
 
9.  (C) Under Secretary for Disarmament and International 
Security Affairs Nutan Kapoor listed GOI efforts to enhance 
their enforcement capabilities:  some pre-license checks on 
end-users, risk assessments, post-shipment/installation 
verification, and random inspections, all of which may result 
in confiscation or other penalties.  These measures also 
apply to brokering activities of authorized customs house 
agents.  To prevent the unauthorized transfer of intangible 
technology, Indian scientists going abroad for training must 
get GOI clearance, as do scholars, while visa applications 
for visiting scientists and scholars are subject to 
inter-ministerial approval.  On re-exports, Kapoor said that 
under all circumstances, SCOMET items can only be exported 
with a license and that the GOI undertakes pre-license 
checks.  Finally, training for Customs officials is ongoing. 
For example, India and the US have had 16 exchanges of export 
control experts since 2000, four in the past year.  Russell 
underscored the value of EXBS exchanges, and offered to 
provide more training as India increases its staffing in this 
area.  As this is an evolving process, Shankar also suggested 
examining best practices from other countries and regimes. 
 
Outreach Initiatives Complicated by Visa Problems 
-------------------- ---------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar reported that 
relevant GOI departments, including the MEA, are in the 
process of conducting outreach to industry and related 
associations.  She also suggested that industry-to-industry 
outreach would be constructive.  However, the GOI is awaiting 
a response from the USG on several proposals for 
industry-to-industry exchanges, according to Jaishankar, 
complicated by the \"hangover effect\" of difficulties Indian 
scientists face in obtaining visas.  He recalled cases where 
individual scientists were granted visas but were then barred 
from visiting the labs that had invited them.  He said he 
spoke to A/S for Consular Affairs Maura Harty about the 
matter during her recent visit to New Delhi.  \"The ongoing 
problem of visas poses a serious operational constraint on 
what we\'re trying to do,\" he said.  A/S Rocca assured him 
that the US is aware of these problems and is trying to 
streamline this process, which requires clearances from 
several agencies before a visa is issued. 
 
Adherence to MTCR and NSG Guidelines 
------------------------------------ 
 
11.  (C) An important step required of India in Phase Two is 
agreeing to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines and Annex and the 
NSG Guidelines, and its associated trigger list and dual-use 
list.  Russell described the MTCR as a non-treaty political 
understanding among 34 states sharing common interests in the 
non-proliferation of missiles, rocket and unmanned air 
vehicle systems and technology.  Other countries can \"adhere\" 
to the MTCR unilaterally without being a member of the 
regime, as have Israel and Romania, she said. 
 
12.  (C) Drawing from prepared points, Russell went on to 
explain that Part 1 of the NSG Guidelines requires that for 
transfers of Trigger List items or technology, the recipient 
state must have IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear facilities 
(\"full-scope safeguards\").  Part 2 of the Guidelines governs 
exports of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, technology and 
materials.  Actual adherence is not required in Phase Two, 
but rather, India should provide a firm commitment in Phase 
Two to adhere to these regimes in Phase Three.  Such a 
commitment would be in writing, similar to the policy 
statements that India provided in Phase One.  Actual 
adherence would come in Phase Three, and would involve the 
related actions by India in that phase, including: 
harmonization of its national control list with the export 
control lists of the regimes; and enactment of relevant 
legislation to conform to the accepted standard among regime 
members and adherents, including on intangible technology 
transfers and catch-all. 
 
13.  (C) In response, GOI Department of Atomic Energy 
representative noted that the India already has stringent 
mechanisms in place that are analogous to the NSG guidelines, 
such as the Proscribed Equipment List, Proscribed Substances 
List, and Radioactive Items List. 
 
US Steps on License Requirements, Nuke Safety, Space, MD 
----------- --------------------- ---------------------- 
 
14.  (C) DAS Borman listed what the US has committed to do 
under Phase Two:  Remove license requirements for EAR 999/99 
items to all safeguarded facilities in India; expand NRC 
dialogue to cover topics in Phase Two; and suggested a 
US-India cooperation on satellite development, production, 
marketing and operating.  Jaishankar asked for a paper 
clarifying what removal of EAR 99 license requirements 
entails, rather than \"having to interpret US law for 
ourselves.\"  Removal of EAR 99 license requirements was the 
subject of a separate meeting between Borman, NP 
representative, and GOI officials (septel). 
 
Request for Flexibility on Nuclear Safety 
----------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar expressed strong 
interest in examining how some US controls can be relaxed in 
Phase Two, specifically for NSG controlled safety-related 
equipment, perhaps under the NSG safety exemption. 
\"Flexibility on this would make it easier to demonstrate 
progress to our constituency, so that they see that we are 
getting something in exchange for revising our laws,\" she 
argued.  The Department of Atomic Energy representative 
expressed hope that cooperation will be expanded beyond the 
nuclear island and include training related to fourth 
generation nuclear reactors. Russell noted that the trend in 
the NSG has been to strengthen the safety exemption rather 
than be more lenient.  Jaishankar added that he wanted to 
explore training opportunities for Indian scientists in 
nuclear safety and hopes to expand the dialogue on this issue 
to include the US Department of Energy. 
 
Expanded Cooperation on Civil Space Programs 
----------------------------------- -------- 
 
16.  (C) On expanding cooperation on civil space programs, 
DAS Borman said that Phase Three will involve the signing of 
a Space Launch Agreement, similar to that which the US signed 
with Russia and Ukraine.  Jaishankar expressed interest in 
this agreement, which in Phase Three would allow the launch 
of US satellites as well as indigenous satellites with US 
components.  Department of Space representative reaffirmed 
GOI intention to revise ISRO\'s Request for Proposals to 
require disclosure of US content and compliance with US 
licensing conditions (Reftel D).  Responding to ISRO 
questions about the US commitment to space cooperation, 
PolCouns underscored the end-state we seek for full scope 
US-Indian civilian space cooperation, including ability to 
launch US satellites and satellites with US components. 
 
17.  (C) Demonstrating the societal benefits of India\'s space 
program, Space Department representative said that the GOI 
recently initiated a program to link village council members 
around the country via satellite and communication equipment 
provided by ISRO.  ISRO representative also detailed several 
pending requests in the area of space cooperation.  DAS 
Borman suggested the GOI provide a list of the sort of 
specific cooperation that ISRO would like to see in Phase Two 
as well as a list of the pending requests mentioned. 
Finally, when asked when all ISRO subsidiaries would be 
removed from the Entity List, Borman responded that such an 
issue could not be reviewed until after Phase Three. 
 
Missile Defense 
--------------- 
 
18.  (C) On continuing the missile defense dialogue, in the 
October 20 session, Shankar said the GOI will first undertake 
an internal exploratory meeting with its agencies. 
Responding to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) proposal (made 
at the June 2004 Defense Policy Group meeting) to conduct a 
series of planning events leading to a command post exercise 
in January 2006, Jaishankar said the GOI agrees with the 
proposal and would like to conduct the first planning meeting 
in the first quarter of CY 2005.  Regarding the US offer to 
sell India PAC-2 missile defense capability, Jaishankar said 
the GOI wants to \"telescope\" (combine) briefings on PAC-2 and 
PAC-3, so the &right set of people8 can look at the issue 
in its entirety. OSD India Country Director Alverson replied 
that he would convey the GOI requests to DOD officials in 
Washington.  Alverson noted that the MDA activities would be 
useful to India in helping India determine for itself what 
are its missile defense requirements, which should be the 
first element of conversation between our experts on the sale 
of a missile defense system. 
 
Issues for Follow-up 
-------------------- 
 
19.  (C) During the course of the 2-day discussions, the 
following issues arose for further follow-up: 
 
For joint action by the USG and GOI: 
 
-- Agreement on date for initial planning meeting with MDA on 
missile defense command post exercise;

1.  (C) Summary: Following two relatively rocky summits, and 
the postponement of this year\'s meeting, New Delhi hopes the 
November 8 India-EU Summit will yield tangible progress, MEA 
Director (Europe - I) Dammu Ravi told Poloff on November 2. 
The GOI priority is to kickoff a new \"strategic partnership\" 
with Europe, although the parties have yet to fill it with 
much substance.  Collaboration on climate change, science and 
technology, and cultural cooperation are likely to be the 
major emphases of the Indian delegation.  New Delhi is much 
more interested in engaging bilaterally with major EU players 
like the UK, France, and Germany, and is frustrated when 
smaller EU members hold the Presidency, not only because of 
their perceived lack of gravitas, but also because they are 
prone to sermonizing on human rights and nuclear 
proliferation.  The MEA is skeptical of the EU\'s ability to 
present a coherent foreign policy, and privately describes 
the conglomerate as naive, overly pro-active, and 
short-sighted, particularly when it comes to developments in 
South Asia.  Despite the rhetoric on strategic partnership, 
New Delhi will continue to emphasize bilateral relations with 
London, Paris, and Berlin at the expense of the EU, as 
evidenced by the October 27-28 visit of French FM Barnier. 
End Summary. 
 
Towards \"Strategic Partnership\" 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) India and the EU are \"slowly broadening our areas of 
interaction,\" from primarily an economic focus to a greater 
political dialogue, MEA Director (Europe - I) Dammu Ravi told 
Poloff on November 2.  As India\'s largest trading block, with 
USD 28 billion per year in two-way trade (compared to USD 18 
billion with the US), economic issues have traditionally 
served as the driving force behind India\'s relations with EU 
member states.  While finance and trade will continue to 
dominate New Delhi\'s ties with Europe, India has responded 
positively to EU overtures to move toward a \"strategic 
partnership.\"  This strategic partnership will strengthen 
collaboration in five key areas, including: multilateral 
conflict prevention; the fight against terrorism; 
non-proliferation and human rights; strengthened economic 
partnerships; development policies to help India meet the 
millennium development goals; and intellectual and cultural 
exchanges. 
 
3.  (C) According to local media, the goal is eventually to 
pattern the strategic relationship after the US-India Next 
Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP), including the transfer 
of non-military technology and joint research in the civilian 
nuclear field, although there is no endorsement of anything 
approaching the level of US-India engagement in this area. 
MEA\'s Ravi asserted the GOI hope for greater interaction in 
the areas of science and technology, specifically mentioning 
biotechnology and nanotechnology.  Underlining on-going 
Indo-European cooperation on Galileo, and satellite launches, 
Ravi commented that India\'s large pool of scientifically 
literate manpower offers many \"natural opportunities for 
collaboration.\" 
 
Expectations for the Summit 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Given the disappointing results from the 2002 and 
2003 summits, India views the November 8 Hague meeting as an 
opportunity to get the process back on track.  The 
postponement of this year\'s gathering due to the illness of 
Dutch PM Jan Peter Balkanende created anxieties about a 
reprise of the 2003 summit which then-EU President Silvio 
Berlusconi failed to attend due to stomach ailments, despite 
high-level attendance on the Indian side.  (Note: The 2002 
Summit was overshadowed by strong public differences between 
India and the EU over Kashmir, dialogue in South Asia, and 
cross-border terrorism, a situation reflected by the absence 
of any mention of these subjects in the joint statement.)  In 
view of the past problems, India is hoping for a successful 
event this year, Ravi told us, explaining that New Delhi 
plans to arrive there \"at full strength,\"  despite the fact 
that \"these events are largely symbolic anyway.\"  The GOI 
delegation will include the PM, FM Natwar Singh, NSA JN 
Dixit, Commerce Minister Nath, and Foreign Secretary Saran. 
 
5.  (C) In a soon-to-be-published interview with the 
\"Financial Times,\" PM Manmohan Singh identified a variety of 
economic and social issues for which he would like to see a 
stronger partnership between the EU and India, and 
specifically mentioned climate change.  Ravi noted New 
Delhi\'s satisfaction with the EU\'s recognition of India as an 
influential actor in the global war against terrorism, WMD, 
and climate change, and said the EU\'s desire for a strategic 
partnership with New Delhi indicates Brussels\' recognition 
that India is a rising global power. 
 
Big Powers and Small States 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) While emphasizing that \"India does not discriminate\" 
between the larger and smaller EU states, Ravi observed that 
India draws a distinction between those with more influence 
and power, such as the two permanent Security Council and 
multiple G-8 members.  In India\'s experience, smaller 
countries (such as Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Greece) 
tend to focus more on sensitive issues such as human rights 
and non-proliferation, while the larger countries such as 
France, Germany, and the UK emphasize economic issues, 
defense, and military cooperation.  The GOI also discusses 
human rights and non-proliferation with these countries, but 
such subjects are more palatable in a larger strategic 
context.  He added that India views many of the small EU 
member countries as \"intrusive and preachy.\" 
 
7.  (C) The difference between the large and small European 
states\' approach to India becomes a problem when countries 
like Ireland and Denmark assume the EU presidency, Ravi 
commented, explaining that they bring human rights and 
non-proliferation issues to the top of the agenda.  While 
Brussels\' institutions are broadly supportive of ties with 
India, and will not hold them \"hostage\" to certain issues, 
New Delhi looks forward to the UK\'s assumption of the 
Presidency in January, Ravi stated. 
 
8.  (C) As the world\'s most populous democracy and an 
aspiring global power, India views criticism from smaller 
European countries as an indication that they do not take New 
Delhi seriously as a global player.  Jawaharlal Nehru 
University European Studies Professor Salma Bava 
characterized the July 2003 GOI decision to refuse aid from 
countries other than the US, UK, Germany, Japan, the EU, and 
Russia as an attempt to demonstrate New Delhi\'s rising power 
status.  Although the decision has since been partially 
reversed, the GOI hoped to remove financial leverage from 
those countries prone to sermonizing about human rights, she 
surmised. 
 
A \"Difference in Perception\" on South Asia 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Indo-European differences of opinion on political 
matters are most pronounced over developments in India\'s 
backyard.  Whether regarding Burma, Nepal, Bhutan, or 
Kashmir, MEA officials have expressed annoyance with the EU 
approach to South Asia, describing the EU as too \"obvious, 
shabby, shortsighted and full of contradictions,\" naive, 
overly pro-active, and possessing a \"tendency to go 
overboard\" when it comes to delicate issues (Refs A and C). 
 
10.  (C) According to MEA Director Ravi, the EU has supported 
or pursued policies \"which will not help South Asia in the 
long run.\"  The EU instinct is to internationalize issues, 
such as Nepal and Kashmir, that India believes are better 
located in the bilateral realm.  The EU has not yet realized 
that when it comes to South Asia, \"India understands the 
issues best,\" he opined. 
 
11.  (C) Ravi echoed Joint Secretary (Nepal and Bhutan) 
Ranjit Rae\'s recent assessment that the EU has illustrated 
its naivete on Nepal by pursuing an interventionist, 
UN-tinged approach.  He underlined the lack of unity within 
the EU on Nepal, observing that some member states believe 
the best approach is to support the Monarchy, while others 
argue for military intervention.  Europe should carefully 
choose its words \"because what they say could have extreme 
consequences.\"  He also emphasized the Indian perception that 
the EU is unbalanced when dealing with Bhutanese refugees in 
Nepal. \"Encouraging the sides to talk is one thing,\" but the 
EU has a reputation for being \"partisan\" in favor of the 
refugees, he stated. 
 
Clumsy on Kashmir 
----------------- 
 
12.  (C) According to JNU\'s Bava, the clumsy EU positions on 
Kashmir have fed Indian skepticism of the EU as a political 
entity.  EU Ambassador Francisco da Camara Gomes\' June 
comment that Kashmir is \"an integral part of India,\" not only 
created an uproar among Kashmiri separatist groups but served 
to illustrate Europe\'s lumbering approach to one of India\'s 
most sensitive subjects.  An EU parliamentary group that 
traveled to Kashmir shortly after the remarks described 
Kashmir as a \"nuclear flashpoint,\" and termed the Kashmir 
Valley as \"the world\'s most beautiful prison,\" while 
encouraging tripartite talks involving India, Pakistan, and 
the Kashmiris, seriously annoying New Delhi (Ref B). 
 
Bilateral Engagement at EU Expense 
---------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) As the EU has yet to formulate a common foreign 
policy, it is a difficult entity to deal with politically, 
the MEA\'s Ravi observed.  According to Professor Bava, the 
lack of political consensus within the EU, on Iraq for 
example, prevents New Delhi from viewing Brussels as a 
serious interlocutor on political affairs.  The EU does not 
present a unified front on these issues, encouraging the GOI 
to cultivate bilateral political relationships, often at the 
expense of the EU as an institution.  Bava agreed that India 
benefits from the political differences among EU member 
states, speculating that the GOI will continue engaging the 
Europeans bilaterally, despite plans for an India-EU 
strategic partnership. 
 
14.  (C) Although a new development in India\'s relations with 
the EU, \"strategic partnerships\" between New Delhi and 
individual European countries are already well underway.  The 
MEA has described the GOI\'s bilateral relations with the UK, 
Germany, France and Italy as \"strategic partnerships,\" always 
emphasizing the bilateral aspect of relations during 
high-level visits to New Delhi.  (See Ref E for information 
on the latest Indo-German interaction.) 
 
Barnier\'s Visit 
--------------- 
 
15.  (C) During French FM Michel Barnier\'s October 27-28 
visit to New Delhi, strategic issues, including defense, 
civilian nuclear cooperation, and the GOF\'s project to sell 
six Scorpene submarines were high on the agenda.  Offering an 
upbeat assessment of the visit, which followed the February 
visit of former FM de Villepin (Ref D), the MEA\'s Ravi 
described Paris as \"largely supportive\" of India\'s 
initiatives.  France never criticizes New Delhi\'s nuclear 
ambitions, and acknowledges that the GOI non-proliferation 
record is as \"clean as can be,\" he stated.  Expressing New 
Delhi\'s disappointment that the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) 
\"bottlenecks the way France wants to cooperate\" on nuclear 
issues, Ravi said Indian officials had encouraged France to 
be more forthright in engagement with other NSG members, and 
to convey the message that \"India is different.\" 
 
16.  (C) Prior to Barnier\'s visit, Indian officials in Paris 
and Foreign Secretary Saran in Delhi conveyed a strong 
message on India\'s desire to cooperate with France in the 
nuclear arena, pointing to an increase in Indian impatience 
for the NSG to accommodate India on fuel supplies and other 
nuclear technology.  During the visit, FM Natwar Singh and 
NSA JN Dixit repeatedly offered a less pointed message. 
According to the French Embassy, Barnier indicated in 
response that Paris was sympathetic to India\'s concerns, but 
that the NPT and NSG created substantial obstacles that would 
not easily be overcome.  The French Embassy said after the 
fact that, if there was a move within the NSG to find 
accommodation for India, Paris would be sympathetic, but that 
France (\"unlike Russia\") would not be willing to breach the 
NSG unilaterally for India\'s benefit.  Press reports focused 
on the French invitation for India to participate in the 
International Thermonuclear Reactor project (ITER), noting 
that it would bracket India with key international players, 
including all five nuclear powers.  However, the MEA has not 
confirmed these reports. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (C) The November 8 India-EU summit will provide the 
first concrete indications of just how much weight the GOI is 
willing to give to the EU as a serious political partner. 
Despite New Delhi\'s positive noises about a \"strategic 
partnership\" and hopes for a successful summit, political 
relations with the European Union will likely continue to 
take a back seat to New Delhi\'s bilateral relations with the 
larger EU member states.  Over the long term, significant 
differences of opinion about the approach to conflicts in 
South Asia, as well as New Delhi\'s strategy of cultivating 
relationships primarily with those countries the GOI believes 
to be of major power status, will constrain the India-EU 
political relationship.

1.  (C) Summary:  Since losing the May elections, the BJP 
leadership has failed to resolve internal disputes between 
its moderate and Hindutva wings over the reasons for its 
defeat.  The Sangh (family of Hindu groups) is urging the 
party to return to its Hindutva roots, but the leadership is 
unwilling to endorse this course.  Party President and former 
DPM Advani is leaning towards \"moderate Hindutva\" as a means 
to placate the Sangh and keep secular parties in the National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA).  Although determined to confront 
the UPA both inside and outside of Parliament, the BJP cannot 
return to power over the medium term, and poses no serious 
threat to the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) 
government.  Both the NDA and UPA are concentrating on three 
state elections slated for February 2005, which could 
consolidate Congress momentum according to early predictions. 
 Should the BJP do badly in these contests, the UPA could 
remain in power for years to come.  End Summary. 
 
Confusion Still Reigns 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (U) On October 18, the BJP sacked party President 
Venkaiah Naidu, and replaced him with former DPM L.K. Advani 
(Ref B).  Press reports indicate that the BJP hopes Advani 
will provide strong leadership, overcome deep rifts in the 
party leadership, and lead it back to power.  In an early 
indication as to which direction he wants to take the party, 
Advani committed the BJP to building a Ram temple in Ayodhya 
on October 26, met RSS leaders for two hours on October 31, 
and pledged to attend a hard-line RSS leadership conference 
on November 5 and 6 in Hardwar. 
 
3.  (U) Indications are that the party\'s internal rifts 
remain as deep as ever.  On November 1, Vishwa Hindu Parishad 
(VHP) leader Ashok Singal criticized Advani as a \"stop-gap\" 
president who lacked mass appeal, and the Sangh Parivar 
leadership said it would accept nothing less than a return to 
Hindutva ideology.  Despite its unhappiness with the BJP\'s 
failure to return to Hindutva, the Sangh Parivar gave no 
indication that it would follow through on earlier threats to 
form a purely Hindu party.  On October 31, a disaffected RSS 
activist revived the old Jan Sangh as a new Hindu nationalist 
grouping, but no BJP leaders joined him. 
 
Limited Options 
--------------- 
 
4.  (C) On November 4, well-connected television journalist 
Harish Gupta told Poloff that the RSS wants Advani to give up 
aspirations of a quick return to power, to allow the UPA 
government to complete a full five-year term, and to use that 
period to rebuild the party from the ground up.  According to 
Gupta, Advani is reluctant to accept this plan, as it would 
prevent him from becoming PM.  If the party adopted this 
approach, it would have to select an heir apparent from its 
second tier leadership.  The two most likely candidates are 
Murli Manohar Joshi and Sushma Swaraj, both of whom are 
hard-liners who enjoy the confidence of the Sangh Parivar 
 
5.  (C) Gupta claimed that Joshi was the Sangh Parivar\'s 
first choice to become party president and Advani was happy 
to remain leader of the parliamentary opposition, taking the 
job only to prevent Joshi\'s rise to power.  Gupta predicted 
that Advani would fare badly in the post, as the BJP\'s 
current options are extremely limited, and that he would take 
the blame for a situation in which there is little prospect 
for a positive outcome. 
 
6.  (C) Gupta pointed out that Bihar and Jharkhand go to the 
polls in February 2005, and because the BJP has no presence 
there, it must rely on its ally the Janata Dal(U), headed by 
former Defense Minister George Fernandes to carry the NDA\'s 
water.  The strongly secular Fernandes objected to Advani\'s 
pro Hindutva tilt and comments regarding the Ram temple, 
setting off speculation that his party could leave the NDA. 
This leaves Advani trapped between the Sangh Parivar and the 
NDA\'s secular allies, with no easy choice between the two. 
Deep Divisions 
-------------- 
 
7.  (C) The BJP itself remains deeply divided and in no shape 
to present a serious challenge to the UPA government. 
Advani\'s public stance indicates that he hopes to unite the 
party around a \"moderate Hindutva\" orientation aimed at 
pleasing the Sangh Parivar while not alienating moderates led 
by Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan, and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi. 
Advani is counting on the help of Joshi and Sushma Swaraj, 
who are ascendant.  However, both Joshi and Swaraj want to 
become PM.  Until the party agrees on its next PM candidate, 
it will be plagued by continued distrust and rivalry within 
its top leadership. 
 
But Determined to Confront the UPA 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Despite its weaknesses and string of electoral 
defeats, the BJP remains determined to confront the UPA, even 
on economic reform where there is no substantive 
disagreement.  In a November 1 meeting with the Ambassador 
(Ref A), BJP Rajya Sabha leader Jaswant Singh bristled at the 
personal attacks by the UPA has been leveling against the BJP 
leadership and what it views as UPA efforts to purge the 
bureaucracy of civil servants with BJP sympathies.  Singh 
also disparaged PM Manmohan Singh\'s abilities and described 
the cabinet as a \"disaster.\" 
 
9.  (SBU) Advani and other BJP parliamentary leaders 
confirmed this private stance, telling the press that the 
party will confront the UPA on the floor of parliament on a 
long laundry list of issues including:  \"tainted ministers,\" 
the UPA\'s handling of terrorism in J&K, and the government\'s 
handling of domestic security, which Party spokesman Naqvi 
characterized as \"the worst since Independence.\" 
 
10.  (U) Although the BJP will confront the UPA in 
Parliament, it is also planning to change its tactics. 
Advani told the party leadership that the previous 
disruptions were \"counterproductive,\" and that the party was 
determined to conduct no more walkouts and boycotts.  Advani 
characterized these as \"mistakes,\" saying \"I don\'t think it 
will happen again.\"  However, speaking at a November 5 
conference, party leader and former Law Minister Arun Jaitley 
made clear that the BJP would not apologize for introducing 
parliamentary gridlock that makes it difficult for the UPA to 
pursue a substantive agenda. 
 
No Good Options 
--------------- 
 
11.  (C) Although the BJP will continue to lock horns with 
Congress, there is little to indicate that this will benefit 
the party, as there is no clear option under which the BJP 
could quickly return to power.  The BJP and its NDA allies do 
not currently have the numbers to bring down the government 
through defection, or a vote of no-confidence, and are not 
strong enough to defeat the UPA in an election. 
 
12.  (C) The Left/Communists can bring down the government by 
withdrawing their support, but this would not benefit the 
BJP, because it does not have enough allies to put together 
an alternative.  The Communists would only leave the UPA 
after forging a third front with other Left-oriented parties 
such as the Janata Dal(U) of Bihar and the Samajwadi 
Party(SP) of Uttar Pradesh (UP), led by Chief Minister 
Mulayam Singh Yadav.  As a sworn enemy of the Left, the BJP 
could never join or support such a grouping. 
 
13.  (C) The Sangh Parivar leadership argues that the BJP 
should stop attempting to strengthen the NDA by pandering to 
secular parties, and instead ally only with the Shiv Sena and 
those parties willing to accept its Hindutva agenda.  Should 
Advani accept this proposal, it would further weaken the NDA 
by causing most secular parties to leave the alliance, 
postponing the day when it can return to power.  Should he 
reject it, the increasingly disaffected Sangh Parivar could 
withdraw its support, which is crucial to the BJP\'s grass 
roots organization. 
 
The Importance of State Elections

14.  (C) The NDA and the UPA are now focused on the February 
elections in Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana, as they will be 
indicative of which grouping is generating political 
momentum.  Congress sees these state victories as a crucial 
step towards its goal of gaining sufficient strength to call 
new elections, win a Parliamentary majority and form a 
government without the Communists.  Most political observers 
agree that as soon as Congress is strong enough, it will call 
new elections. 
 
15.  (C) In order to blunt UPA momentum, the BJP/NDA needs to 
demonstrate to the Indian voter that it is gathering strength 
and can present a serious electoral challenge to Congress. 
Should the NDA fare badly in these state elections, it will 
lose momentum, leading to more divisions, increasing 
criticism of Advani and more calls by the Sangh Parivar to 
embrace a Hindu nationalist ideology and agenda. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
16.  (C) India\'s key political players -- the BJP/NDA, the 
Congress/UPA and the Communists -- are all vying for 
position, with trends favoring Congress.  However, none of 
the three groupings has sufficient strength to rule on its 
own, and the BJP cannot bring down the government or bring on 
a new election.  Although the BJP will engage in noisy 
disputes with the UPA on a number of issues in the coming 
months, they are unlikely to have much impact, aside from 
slowing legislation.  With the BJP distracted by deep 
divisions and immersed in its internal affairs, Congress has 
an opportunity to convince the electorate that it has the 
ability to rule effectively.  Facing no serious short-term 
political challenge from the BJP, Congress could only provide 
its BJP rivals an opening by failing to perform up to 
expectations.

1. (C) Indian Joint Secretary for the Americas in the Indian 
Ministry of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar called DCM 
November 5, to inform the USG about the specifics of Indian 
assistance to Iraq to help prepare for the upcoming Iraqi 
elections.  Jaishankar said India is offering a 3-part 
assistance program: 
 
-- The Indian Election Commission will provide training for 
thirty Iraqi election officials for a period of two weeks. 
 
-- India will commit five million dollars to the 
International Democracy Fund under the aegis of the UN. 
 
-- The Indian Election Commission also will offer to assist 
Iraq to draft regulations for the conduct of the Iraqi 
Elections.  Jaishankar said India is prepared to invite Iraqi 
Election Commission officials to India to consult on the 
draft regulations, if that would be helpful. 
 
2. (C) DCM welcomed news of the Indian offer and asked 
whether India had communicated the specifics of its program 
to the Iraqis.  Jaishankar responded that thus far India had 
only communicated with the United States and the UN on this 
matter.  DCM urged Jaishankar to have the appropriate MEA 
officials contact the Iraqi\'s directly. 
 
3. (C) DCM also asked whether India intended to make its 
offer public.  Jaishankar responded that an oblique reference 
to the assistance had appeared for the first time publicly in 
Prime Minister\'s Monmohan Singh\'s congratulatory letter to 
President Bush.  Given the continued sensitivities in India 
about Iraq, Jaishankar indicated that it would be best from 
India\'s domestic political perspective to keep news of 
India\'s program in a UN context.  He requested that the 
United States not make public news of India\'s electoral 
program, so that India could manage how and when to do so. 
 
4. (C) Comment: India has undertaken this Electoral 
Assistance Program primarily as a gesture to the United 
States.  As Jaishankar\'s comments reflect, any kind of 
assistance by India to Iraq is likely to be sensitive here 
and subject to criticism by Left and others.  Mission 
requests that all addressees respect the GOI\'s request that 
the U.S. not publicize news of this offer until the GOI 
itself has done so. 
 
5. (U) Minimize considered.

1.  (C) Summary: Indian Communist Party leaders have 
criticized PM Manmohan Singh\'s warm welcome of President 
Bush\'s re-election, calling this \"an attempt to please 
American imperialism.\"  Interestingly, however, party 
spokesperson D. Raja welcomed the PM\'s commitment to train 
Iraqi election officials in India enunciated in the same 
letter.  Other Left parties refused to comment on the US 
election outcome, saying they are more concerned about Indian 
domestic issues such as the November 4 petrol price hike and 
foreign direct investment.  End Summary. 
 
Reaction to US Election 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) In contrast to the ruling United Progressive 
Alliance, India\'s Communists have reacted ambivalently to 
negatively to the re-election of President Bush.  On November 
4 Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) Politburo member MK 
Pandhe dismissed the congratulatory letter of PM Manmohan 
Singh to President Bush as \"an attempt to please American 
imperialism.\"  CPI spokesman D. Raja stated to Laboff on 
November 5 that \"Bush was not positive for India in the 
past,\" and he \"could not comment on how Bush will behave in 
his second term.\" 
 
Concerns over Petrol Hike 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Rather than focusing on the US election results, our 
Left contacts emphasized domestic issues, asserting that they 
will continue to oppose UPA economic liberalization 
proposals, arguing that these overshadow foreign policy 
concerns for Indians.  They pointed out that the UPA and the 
Left have been discussing a petrol price hike for months, and 
finally reached a reluctant agreement.  Raja expressed 
concern about the increase, claiming it would further 
exacerbate inflation and worsen conditions for the poor. 
Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP Abani Roy reiterated 
to Laboff that the Left parties will keep close tabs on price 
increases of petroleum, diesel fuel, kerosene, and LPG 
(liquefied natural gas), and speak out if they become too 
egregious. 
 
FDI 
--- 
 
4.  (SBU) The Left Front leaders also repeated that they 
remain adamantly opposed to FDI hikes in the insurance and 
telecom sectors.  They pointed out that they agreed to an 
increase in civil aviation FDI from 40- 49% only because they 
believe it will benefit domestic airlines, and exclude 
foreign carriers. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
5.  (C) D. Raja emphasized that the GOI should send no 
Indians whatsoever to Iraq, even for election monitoring. 
However, the CPI welcomed the Prime Minister\'s proposal to 
train Iraqi election officials in India (ref C).  RSP MP Roy 
stated that a democratic Iraq is better for the world, adding 
that they would embrace training Iraqi election officials 
only under the auspices of the United Nations.  (Comment: the 
GOI has not publicized the specifics of its proposal yet as 
explained in ref C.)  Left Front leaders refused to comment 
on other aspects of the Bush administration\'s Iraq policy. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) The Left Front\'s discontent with the UPA\'s pro-US and 
pro-economic liberalization policies continues to grow, and 
its dissent from the GOI\'s warm welcome of another Bush 
Presidency comes as no surprise.  As BJP leader Arun Jaitley 
recently pointed out, the Left increasingly behaves more like 
an opposition, than a supporter of the government.  But, as 
the Prime Minister\'s effusive letter to President Bush 
demonstrates, the government is willing to ignore the Left on 
many issues of importance to us.

1.  (C) Summary:  As instructed in Ref A, in a separate 
meeting at the conclusion of the Next Steps in Strategic 
Partnership (NSSP) Implementation Group on October 21 (Refs B 
and C), Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, and State 
Acting Office Director for Regional Affairs, Bureau of 
Non-Proliferation Russell delivered orally to MEA Joint 
Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar and other GOI officials 
 
SIPDIS 
from MEA and the Departments of Space and Atomic Energy, 
language about specific activities that would contravene US 
export laws and our understandings under the Phase One 
assurances.  Jaishankar acknowledged the language, adding, 
\"We\'re all on board with that.\"  GOI officials also sought 
clarification about the implications of lifting various 
licensing requirements from the Indian Space Research 
Organization (ISRO) and its subsidiaries, and asked for more 
information about items that may be available to India over 
the course of the next phases of the NSSP.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Drawing on points in Ref A, DAS Borman briefly 
outlined the crafting of the NSSP Letter of Assurances signed 
by Commerce U/S Juster and Foreign Secretary Saran on 
September 17.  Because the GOI found certain language about 
prohibited activities to be redundant, both USG and GOI 
experts agreed not to include the language in the final 
letter.  Seeking formal acknowledgement that the GOI 
understands what activities would contravene US export laws, 
Borman identified certain specific activities that U.S. and 
Indian experts had acknowledged would contravene U.S. export 
control laws and regulations, unless specifically authorized 
by the USG. These include the use of US-origin licensable 
items in: nuclear weapons or unsafeguarded nuclear activities 
or in ballistic missile programs, including any rocket or 
unmanned air vehicle system capable of delivering a payload 
of at least 500 kilograms to a range of at least 300 
kilometers or any ballistic missile systems. In addition, 
U.S. export control laws and regulations impose certain 
limitations on re-exports or retransfers of such items. 
Admitting that US export regulations can be complicated, 
Russell added that the US could provide experts to clarify 
any issues that may arise regarding potential restrictions. 
After Borman presented points in Ref A, Jaishankar responded, 
\"We\'re all on board with that.\" 
 
3.  (C) In response to Jaishankar\'s questions about the 
implications of easing Export Administration Regulation (EAR) 
99 restrictions, Borman stated that in the case of space 
cooperation, for example, some 250 exports of EAR 99 items 
that previously required licenses would now be available to 
the seven subsidiaries of the Indian Space Research 
Organization (ISRO) without a license, except if an item will 
be used for prohibited activities.  Such license-free items 
would include dual-use items for satellites, e.g., electronic 
equipment such as sensors.  Borman offered to provide a list 
of items that previously required licenses and to highlight 
the items for which license requirements would be lifted 
under the remaining Phases of the NSSP. 
 
4.  (C) Dr. S.D. Misra of the Department of Atomic Energy 
(DAE) asked about the implications for licensing 
requirements, using oscilloscopes as an example.  Because 
oscilloscopes are used in televisions and are available on 
the local market, Misra questioned what would be the effect 
of lifting the licensing requirements for this item.  Borman 
replied that the US had approved 223 license applications for 
oscilloscopes in FY 04 and the license requirement for them 
would be lifted entirely in Phase Three. 
 
5.  (C) GOI officials pressed further regarding items that 
may be licensable in Phases Two and Three of the NSSP. 
Jaishankar asked about the difference between EAR 99 items, 
Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), Commerce 
Control List (CCL) items, and Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) items.  Borman explained that EAR 99 is for 
items not specifically controlled by ECCNs, and that if an 
item is not on the CCL, it can generally be exported without 
a license, provided it is not used for banned activities. 
All items on the MCTR list, however, must have licenses, he 
stressed.  In response to Misra\'s query about why some items 
that are only used for safety purposes are controlled by EAR, 
Borman responded that such items may have a dual-use beyond 
safety measures. 
 
6.  (C) Turning to the time limitations of controls, Misra 
asked if end-user verification would expire when an item 
reached the end of its practical working life.  Jaishankar 
concurred that it would be useful to have an agreement on an 
expiration date for end-user verification on applicable 
items.  Borman replied that the US would  require 
documentation to show that the item had been properly 
disposed of. 
 
7.  (C) At the conclusion of the meeting, Jaishankar gave 
Borman a GOI-drafted list of items for follow-up from the 
NSSP Implementation Group meetings (Ref C).  Jaishankar 
reiterated the request for a non-paper or list clarifying 
which items may now be considered for export to India.

1. (U) Summary.  Some Indian companies that buy high tech 
goods are asking potential U.S. exporters to agree to 
additional requirements regarding U.S. export controls, in 
some cases limiting the exporters\' ability to sell in the 
Indian market.  The buyers require clauses in sales contracts 
that state: 1) that U.S. export licenses will be obtained by 
a prescribed date, or the exporter and agent will be liable 
for damages to the buyer for late delivery; 2) that the 
exporter will take full financial and legal responsibility in 
the event that the exporter does not comply with relevant 
export licensing regulations; or 3) that licensing for all 
phases of a project be complete on submission of the bid. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Embassy recently received indications that U.S. high 
tech exporters were being subject to unusual contract clauses 
by Indian public entity importers, requiring the U.S. firms 
to guarantee delivery times regardless of the status of 
export license applications.  At Embassy\'s request, the 
American Chamber of Commerce in India (AmCham) took a survey 
of its members to determine the extent of the time 
constraints and export control clauses.  Some companies 
reported problems that affected their ability to do business 
in India. 
 
Specified Date Clause 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Some U.S. companies have reported clauses in 
purchase agreements that require the delivery of goods within 
a specified period of time, and impose potential penalties 
for delays.  These delivery dates reportedly are based on the 
assumption that export licenses will be obtained by the 
exporter and do not allow for flexibility due to delay or 
denial of these licenses.  For example: 
 
-- Oracle reported that it could not respond to a recent 
tender from Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL).  BEL required the 
bidder to guarantee that it will continue their 
supply/support even in the event that BEL or India comes 
under sanctions from the U.S. Government.  Oracle could not 
make that commitment and so did not bid, and the sale went to 
SAP of Germany. 
 
-- Agilent representatives claim that they volunteer time 
commitments in their bids, and factor in wait times due to 
licensing requirements.  They claim that these commitments do 
not seriously affect their business. 
 
-- IBM claims that it encountered one such request, though it 
did not bid on the tender.  It provided no details of this 
tender. 
 
-- Codem Systems was not a respondent to AmCham\'s survey, but 
it has reported to the Commercial Service\'s Advocacy Center 
that it was penalized by Indian Space Research Organization\'s 
(ISRO) Telemetry Tracking & Command Network (ISTRAC) for a 
licensing delay (Ref A).  In this instance, Codem Systems had 
obtained a TAA 90 days before the contract signing, but the 
DSP-5 license took longer than expected.  ISTRAC would not 
begin technical discussions of the product until the license 
was obtained, and ISTRAC nullified the contract due to the 
delay. 
 
-- Beachcraft, also not a respondent to AmCham\'s survey, has 
reported through other sources that the delivery date clause 
has made it impossible for them to bid successfully (Ref B). 
 
4. (SBU) Other companies have reported clauses that put the 
legal responsibility for obtaining all applicable export 
licenses on the exporter and seem to absolve the Indian buyer 
from legal or financial obligations of not obtaining the 
license. 
 
-- Sun Microsystems noted a clause in a contract with ISRO 
which states:  \"Procedures as required by Law of the Country 
of Export has been followed and necessary export license has 
been obtained wherever required as and when the Exporter 
indemnifies the consignee against any loss or expense he may 
incur due to any fault of the Exporter in the above matter.\" 
(Comment:  The Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research 
(IGCAR) recently faced legal action from the U.S. government 
for buying a product for which the exporter, Technology 
Option, did not obtain necessary export licenses (Ref C). 
This clause may be to protect ISRO from legal or financial 
liability should a similar problem arise in the future.  End 
Comment.) 
 
-- Pratt & Whitney has also reported bid tender clauses 
specifying that export licenses by the bidder\'s country of 
origin are the bidder\'s responsibility, though the tenders 
acknowledge that Indian licenses are then the buyer\'s 
responsibility.  A Pratt & Whitney representative states that 
this requirement forces them to apply for licenses well in 
advance of potential bids. 
 
Other Issues 
------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Though Honeywell Defense has not had any specific 
problems with licensing deadlines, they report that they face 
tenders that require three phases be complete on submission: 
1) Buy; 2) Buy and assemble; and 3) Build locally with 
technology transfer.  Because Honeywell is unable to obtain 
licenses to build locally until a formal contract is in 
place, they report that they lose business when faced with 
these tender requirements. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) India has made no international commitments on the 
openness of government contracts, and most of the examples 
given above are for contracts involving Indian public sector 
undertakings (PSU).  However, contractual requirements that 
penalize U.S. companies for adhering to export control 
regulations seem to run counter to the spirit of the HTCG and 
NSSP goals.  The insertion of these clauses may indicate the 
confusion that many Indian firms are experiencing in 
negotiating the complexity of U.S. export control 
requirements.  Greater outreach to Indian buyers might be an 
effective way to deal with some of the problems that U.S. 
exporters are experiencing.

1.  (C) Summary: India remains upbeat on relations with 
Pakistan as the pair look toward Round Two of the Composite 
Dialogue (CD) beginning in late November and extending 
through early 2005, but is seeking to dampen expectations for 
breakthroughs on tough bilateral issues such as Kashmir.  The 
decline in terrorist infiltration over the last few months 
enabled PM Singh to announce a troop reduction in J&K on 
November 11, paving the way for his November 17-18 trip to 
the Valley.  There is curiosity about a possible 
Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, although the economic case 
is questionable.  There is also increasing speculation that 
the December 7-8 meeting to discuss the mechanics of a 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route will yield a deal both sides 
can live with.  However, senior GOI officials, led by Foreign 
Minister Natwar Singh, have cautioned about \"expecting 
miracles.\"  New Delhi will look for forward movement on the 
70 plus outstanding CBMs it has proposed.  Earlier hopes for 
a formula to demilitarize the Siachen Glacier have subsided. 
Although GOI reacted mildly to President Musharraf\'s October 
25 \"Iftar musings\" on the future of Kashmir, the Indian 
establishment will not entertain any substantial territorial 
changes in J&K.  End Summary. 
 
Atmospherics Continue to Improve 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Since the end of CD Round One in September, Indian 
public and private views on ties with Pakistan have continued 
on a positive trajectory.  Pakistan-bashing in the press is 
much reduced, and there is a widespread sense that 
incremental progress on some bilateral issues will be 
possible in the coming months.  Institute for Peace and 
Conflict Studies (IPCS) director Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Dipankar 
Banerjee called the dialogue \"sustainable at the national 
level, absent a crisis\" such as the 2001 attack on the Indian 
Parliament.  Commodore Uday Bhaskar of the MOD-linked 
Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA) predicted 
that the upcoming series of talks (see expanded schedule para 
18) would produce some results because many of the issues on 
the table are \"pragmatic, not political,\" and do not involve 
territory.  Trade, people-to-people exchanges, and law 
enforcement cooperation make \"win-win scenarios possible.\" 
 
3.  (C) The most important improvements in the Indo-Pak 
relationship have been the decline in terrorist infiltration 
across the LOC and the ceasefire, which will complete its 
first anniversary on November 25.  Although most Indian 
commentators credit the LOC fence for this decline, South 
Block officials stress that the fencing would not have been 
possible without the ceasefire.  A senior security official 
recently told \"The Hindu\" that \"The evidence on the ground 
shows that Pakistan is cooperating.  Whether such cooperation 
is long-term or episodic remains to be seen.\" 
 
Troop Reductions in J&K 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C) PM Manmohan Singh\'s November 11 announcement to 
redeploy an as-yet unspecified number of troops -- press 
speculation puts the number at some 10-15,000 -- from J&K or 
within the state has increased expectations that the GOI may 
have more in store on Kashmir than it has revealed to date. 
Kashmiri separatists from the moderate faction of the 
All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) have welcomed the 
move, even signaling their willingness to meet with the PM 
during his November 17-18 visit to the state (as of November 
16 no meeting has been confirmed, most likely for security 
reasons).  Couching the redeployment as a response to the 
decline in infiltration and the success of the LOC fence, GOI 
officials have also cited the onset of winter as an argument 
that now is the right time to get the dialogue process with 
the Hurriyat back on track.  This move also addresses one of 
the APHC\'s three pre-conditions for dialogue with the GOI 
(the other two being travel to Pakistan and a reduction in 
human rights abuses in the state). 
 
Pushing The Pipeline 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) While some GOI officials have been making the case 
in the press that an Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is in both 
countries\' national interests, the MEA continues to link the 
pipeline to freeing cross-border trade and/or facilitating 
transit trade from India to Afghanistan, Iran, and beyond. 
Lahore-born Indian Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar -- 
who served as India\'s Consul General in Karachi (1978-82) -- 
has been personally spearheading the project, aided by his 
former classmate and friend from Cambridge, Pakistani Foreign 
Minister Kasuri.  Aiyar recently got the nod from the MEA to 
hold talks with his GOP counterpart at the end of November, 
and he is planning to bring together industry professionals 
and bureaucrats from all three countries to a December 15-16 
conference in New Delhi.  In the meantime, he has been 
reaching out to others in Delhi to try to increase the 
momentum for this mega-project. 
 
6.  (C) General Banerjee singled out the gas pipeline as a 
key element in improving Indo-Pakistan relations, because of 
the magnitude and long-term nature of the endeavor.  The 
generally hawkish Director of the Observer Research 
Foundation\'s (ORF) Pakistan Centre, Sushant Sareen, claimed 
to Poloff that the political constraints on a gas pipeline 
through Pakistan no longer exist, and that it is now \"just a 
matter of economics.\"  The proposed pipeline would service no 
more than 10 percent of India\'s current energy needs.  A 
decade ago, when Pakistan opposed a pipeline proposal, it 
could have met as much as 60 percent of India\'s requirement 
-- which would have involved intolerable risks to India\'s 
energy independence.  Sareen listed two additional hurdles to 
the project getting off the ground: 1) shipped LNG benefits 
from the sunk costs of port facilities already built or being 
built over the as-yet unpaid costs of the pipeline; and 2) 
Iran and Pakistan will try to maintain high originating 
prices and transit fees, which could add to the high 
financial costs, thus forcing the project into 
unprofitability.  These industry concerns will have to be 
addressed if the project is to succeed.  Mission also has 
flagged possible ILSA concerns. 
 
7.  (C) Sareen dismissed concerns about pipeline security, 
commenting that insurance, monitoring, redundancy, and gas 
reserves could easily ensure that any short-term disruption 
in supply through Pakistan would not interrupt India\'s energy 
picture.  ORF\'s Wilson John, a skeptic on rapprochement with 
Pakistan, told Poloff recently that if the pipeline is built, 
it would be \"as important as the Indus Waters Treaty, or 
more.\" 
 
Pressure to Drop Trade Barriers 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) A growing number of India-Pakistan private sector 
conferences dot the calendar, highlighting the growing 
interest by industry in both countries in opening commercial 
links and demonstrating readiness to capitalize on potential 
lower trade barriers.  IDSA\'s Bhaskar predicted that the 
pipeline deal would likely lead to a large increase in other 
goods across the border in both directions, whether or not 
they are formally linked.  He held out hope that bilateral 
trade would be liberalized and normalized, and ticked off 
several sectors where he thought Pakistani firms could do 
well in the Indian market: cotton and textiles, buffalo meat 
(\"Pakistan has one of the most advanced animal husbandry 
industries in Asia\"), and selling excess electricity to the 
states of Punjab and Haryana. 
 
Bus Service Looking More Certain 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Progress may also be possible on the proposed 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service when the two sides meet on 
December 7-8 in New Delhi, according to a number of 
well-informed local Pakistan watchers.  Star TV Diplomatic 
Editor Jyoti Malhotra, who accompanied PM Singh to New York, 
recently told Poloff to expect movement on the bus service 
\"sooner rather than later....Manmohan wants it to happen.\" 
ORF\'s Sareen also thought that progress on the bus service 
was likely, especially because it would further fuel the 
\"people-to-people successes\" that have yielded political 
benefits to both Islamabad and New Delhi. 
 
10.  (C) During a recent visit to New Delhi, UK High 
Commissioner in Islamabad Mark Lyall Grant told us that 
Islamabad has all but accepted the use of a \"special 
residency document\" that would be used in conjunction with a 
passport for travel across the LOC.  The document, but not 
the passport, would be stamped upon transit.  This construct 
is similar to several that have been favorably aired in the 
Indian press in recent weeks, which has raised expectations 
that a deal may ripen for the December 7-8 meeting on the bus 
service to be held in New Delhi. 
 
Speculation Outrunning Reality on Territorial Issues 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
11.  (C) Senior GOI officials have gone to some length to 
dampen expectations of a significant breakthrough on Kashmir 
during PM Singh\'s upcoming visit to the Valley and the CD 
Round Two.  Despite the positive atmospherics, in recent days 
Foreign Minister Natwar Singh has repeated the mantra that 
\"There will be no miracle, (but) we are trying our best\" in 
order to control the anticipation of swift and substantial 
progress on the Composite Dialogue\'s toughest issues.  The 
Indian establishment\'s position that any changes on Kashmir\'s 
status must be centered on formalizing the LOC as the border 
remains firm, as summed up by IPCS\'s PR Chari: \"Are the two 
leaderships preparing their people to accept the 
inevitability of the LOC being converted into an 
international border to resolve the Kashmir dispute?\"  Talk 
of independence, joint sovereignty or condominium, division 
among communal lines, or a role for the UN remain 
non-starters for New Delhi, as \"Hindustan Times\" Diplomatic 
Correspondent Saurabh Shukla (who often serves as an MEA 
mouthpiece) wrote on November 15. 
 
Siachen Likely to Remain Frozen 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Recent Indian press commentary suggests that an 
early deal to demilitarize the Siachen Glacier is less 
likely.  ORF\'s Sareen opined that progress would only be 
possible if, as the GOI has publicly insisted, the Actual 
Ground Position Line (AGPL) of the current deployment were 
demarcated in advance, suggesting that New Delhi was prepared 
to wait until Islamabad agrees to concessions on this issue. 
 
Kashmir \"Food for Thought\" Viewed as Leftovers 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
13.  (C) Relatively few Indian analysts have publicly 
dismissed President Musharraf\'s October 25 \"Iftar musings\" on 
moving forward on Kashmir (Ref A), although private comments 
have been more skeptical.  Pakistani High Commissioner Aziz 
Ahmed Khan recently reiterated to an audience at New Delhi\'s 
Jamia Millia Islamia University that Musharraf\'s goal was to 
\"generate discussion and explore possible options.\"  Home 
Minister Shivraj Patil left Musharraf a face-saving out, 
telling journalists that New Delhi would consider the idea as 
a proposal if Islamabad \"forwarded it to us formally.\"  PM 
Singh declined to speculate on how such a proposal would be 
received, referring to it as an \"off-the-cuff remark\" while 
maintaining that \"J&K is an integral part of India and not a 
matter for discussion with outside agencies.\" 
 
14.  (SBU) In a November 16 report, well-connected \"Times of 
India\" Foreign Affairs correspondent Indrani Bagchi noted 
that if the substance of Musharraf\'s \"musings\" should arise 
in formal bilateral discussions, \"they will not fly.\"  Bagchi 
held that the MEA\'s \"remarkable quiet\" on the matter suggests 
that South Block is expecting Islamabad to float fresh 
positions on J&K soon. 
 
15.  (SBU) Indian analysts have predictably praised Musharraf 
for backing off from Islamabad\'s perennial call for a 
plebiscite among Kashmiris to determine the fate of the 
region.  \"Hindu\" strategic commentator Siddharth Varadarajan 
used Musharraf\'s trial balloon to examine past and present 
territorial disputes (Andorra, Northern Ireland, the Aland 
Islands, South Tyrol, Gibraltar, the Basque region, New 
Caledonia, and the Sami region in Scandinavia), concluding 
that although \"none of these examples offers a complete set 
of principles for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, many 
individual elements are attractive.\"  Even as Kashmir 
specialist AG Noorani belittled this proposal, he strongly 
supported Musharraf\'s efforts to replace a plebiscite with 
new and creative proposals for resolving the Kashmir issue. 
 
16.  (C) Describing Musharraf\'s trial balloon \"a mish-mash of 
the Kashmir Study Group, the JKLF\'s proposal, the Owen-Dixon 
plan, and a handful of other ideas all rolled together,\" 
Sareen reasoned that such a plan might be possible in a few 
decades, if both sides can get away from the old baggage, but 
not now.  He stressed that the GOI had not criticized the 
ideas publicly, to avoid putting Musharraf in an awkward 
position.  The real issue for India is cross-border 
terrorism, he stated.  The UK\'s Lyall Grant observed to us 
that from Islamabad\'s perspective, PM Singh had not dismissed 
the concept of making an adjusted LOC into a permanent 
border.  Lyall Grant also conveyed his impression that Singh 
\"wants to fix Indo-Pak relations,\" which will remain as a GOI 
policy priority. 
 
17.  (SBU) Some New Delhi-based Pakistan watchers have been 
more hesitant to give Musharraf the benefit of the doubt. 
Institute for Conflict Management\'s anti-terrorist hawk Ajay 
Sahni brushed the proposal aside, calling it \"both arbitrary 
and nonsensical.\"  This degree of dismissal, however, appears 
to be the minority viewpoint at the moment. 
 
The Schedule Keeps Filling Up 
----------------------------- 
 
18.  (U) Official and unofficial Indo-Pakistan meetings 
through the end of the year, including Round Two of the 
Composite Dialogue (CD), are as follows: 
 
November 23-24 (New Delhi): Pakistani PM Aziz to visit in his 
capacity as outgoing SAARC Chairman.  This will be the first 
meeting between the PMs of India and Pakistan since the 1999 
Lahore Summit.  Aziz will also likely meet Kashmiri 
separatist leaders, President Kalam, and UPA President Sonia 
Gandhi. 
 
November 29-30 (New Delhi): Meetings between narcotics 
control authorities (CD). 
 
Late November (dates and venue TBD): Petroleum ministers to 
discuss Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. 
 
December 2-3 (Islamabad): Meeting between railways 
authorities on the Munnabao-Khokhrapar rail link (CD). 
 
December 3-4 (New Delhi): Meeting between the Indian Coast 
Guard and the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency.  Agenda 
includes discussing an MOU for establishing a communications 
link (CD). 
 
December 5-11: (Patiala, India): Indo-Pakistan Punjab Games. 
 
December 7-8 (New Delhi): Discussion of \"all issues\" relating 
to beginning a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, 
including presumably what documentation will be required for 
Kashmiris crossing the LOC (Ref B)(CD). 
 
December 9-10 (New Delhi): Meeting of the Committee of 
Experts regarding trade issues (CD). 
 
December 14-15 (Karachi): Joint survey of the boundary 
pillars in the horizontal section of the Sir Creek area (CD). 
 
December 14-15 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on nuclear 
confidence-building measures, including discussion on a draft 
agreement for prior notification of missile tests (CD). 
 
December 15-16 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on 
conventional CBMs (CD). 
 
December 15-16 (New Delhi): Conference on \"Iranian Gas Export 
to Pakistan and India,\" to include officials from the 
petroleum ministries of all three countries. 
 
January 9-11 (Dhaka): SAARC Summit. 
 
Proposed but not scheduled: Convening a Joint Working Group 
to combat music and video piracy. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
19.  (C) The upbeat mood in India is based on continuing low 
infiltration levels, increased people-to-people exchanges, 
good atmospherics at recent high-level meetings, and 
restrained Pakistani public statements.  From the New Delhi 
perspective, ties with Islamabad are beginning to acquire the 
semblance of normality, with sparring at a minimum. 
Productive engagement appears to be possible in a number of 
areas, although difficult decisions remain.  Both New Delhi 
and Islamabad need to continue to work for incremental 
progress and increased mutual trust, while managing 
expectations to prevent a blowout if the sides do not achieve 
as much as the optimists seek.  We have seen nothing to 
suggest that any element of the Indian establishment is 
prepared to consider the sort of territorial compromise -- or 
dual control -- that is suggested in President Musharraf\'s 
recent remarks.

REF: STATE 241413 
 
1.  (U) India\'s Cabinet on November 11 gave its approval to 
establish a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the last 
formal hurdle for setting up this long-delayed office. 
Several years have elapsed as the GOI sorted out the 
intramural wrangling over the unit\'s composition and 
responsibilities.  Last May\'s national election, which 
brought the Congress Party into power, was the most recent 
delay as the new Cabinet has spent its first six months in 
office contending with a host of pressing issues. 
 
2. (U) The FIU will be organized as an independent body 
within the Finance Ministry\'s Central Economic Intelligence 
Bureau (CEIB), located in New Delhi.  The press reports that 
the FIU will have an intelligence and an investigative wing. 
 
3.  (SBU) Sharmila Chavaly, our Finance Ministry contact for 
anti-terrorist financing, told us today that the next step 
\"is to identify the people,\" who will serve in the FIU, and 
hoped that the new director would be named \"in the next week 
or so.\"  Chavaly looked forward to pinning down a convenient 
date for a visit to New Delhi by representatives of the 
Treasury Department\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
(FinCEN). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (SBU) India has long signaled its desire to boost 
bilateral cooperation with the US on anti-terrorist 
financing as well as in multi-lateral forums.  However, its 
membership in the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force 
has been pending, with the lack of an FIU as one of several 
hurdles that need to cleared (reftel).  Even though the FIU 
is not yet up and running, the Embassy will move forward 
with plans for an exchange visit with FinCEN.  Blake

SUBJECT:  VISA DENIALS THREATEN CREDIBILITY OF NSSP, OPEN 
DOORS TO FRENCH AND OTHERS 
 
Reference:  NEW DELHI 6833 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  A visit to India\'s premier atomic energy 
establishments by Alain Bugat, Chairman of the French Atomic 
Energy Commission, suggests that France is willing to engage 
in discussions with India on nuclear matters to a degree 
that is inconceivable within the current NSSP framework. 
The visa denial of Baldev Raj ironically made it possible 
for Raj to host Bugat at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic 
Research (IGCAR) in a very high profile visit.  The three to 
four week delay required by the Mantis Security Advisory 
Opinion (SAO) process, together with an apparent increase in 
technology transfer related visa denials, gives heart to 
critics in India\'s scientific establishment who claim the 
NSSP is void of content.  Mission recommends Washington 
establish a process that allows all stakeholders to review 
recommended Mantis SAO denials.  End summary. 
 
Director IGCAR Deemed \"Inadmissible\" to Travel to the US 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.  (SBU) On November 5, 2004 Dr. Baldev Raj (DOB 09 April 
1947), distinguished Scientist and Director of IGCAR, which 
PM Singh has just visited in conjunction with the 
inauguration of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (Ref.), 
was categorized through the SAO Mantis process as 
\"inadmissible\" under Section 212a3A(i)(II). 
 
3.  (SBU) Dr. Raj was to represent IGCAR at the Eighth 
Information Exchange Meeting on Actinide and Fission Product 
Partitioning and Transmutations that took place in Las 
Vegas, Nevada on November 9 to 11, 2004.  This information 
exchange meeting was the eighth in a series that began in 
1990.  According to the organizers, the meeting was an open 
scientific meeting and not subject to any CFR810 controls 
for export of information. 
 
4.  (SBU) Dr. Raj had been quite insistent about obtaining 
information on the status of his visa.  Requests, however, 
ceased about two weeks prior to Raj\'s proposed travel.  On 
November 5, Dr. Raj\'s office told SciCouns that Dr. Raj was 
traveling and would not be back in the office until November 
8. 
 
Chairman Atomic Energy Commission France Visits IGCAR 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Dr. Raj\'s silence did not last long.  Mission 
found out that Alain Bugat, Chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Commission of France, had visited the Atomic Energy 
Commission\'s Kalpakkam site, 60 kilometers from Chennai, on 
November 9.   Kalpakkam hosts the IGCAR, which is the 
headquarters for the Indian Fast Breeder Reactor program, 
the Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) and the Nuclear De- 
salination Demonstration Plant.  At Kalpakkam, in addition 
to discussions with Raj, Bugat met T.S. Rajendran, Director 
of MAPS and Prabhat Kumar, the Director of the Prototype 
Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). 
 
Renewal of Indo-French Nuclear Links 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU) In an interview with T.S. Subramanayan, a reliable 
reporter for \"The Hindu,\" Chairman Bugat said that one of 
the purposes of this visit to India \"is to renew our links 
for cooperation in the field of fast nuclear reactors\" and 
to forge cooperation at the R&D level in scientific topics, 
such as fundamental physics, live sciences, reactor safety 
in thermal reactors and fast breeder reactors.  Bugat ducked 
the question on whether France was prepared to sell India 
Pressurized Light Water Reactors (PLWRs) without insisting 
that India sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 
or implement full scope safeguards as demanded by the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  Bugat\'s response was that 
this was the topic on which he could not speak, as \"we are 
not diplomats.  We\'re technicians, physicists and managers. 
So what I want to say is that cooperation between India and 
France is perfectly respectful of all international 
agreements that India and France have signed.\" 
 
Are India and France Ready to Hop Into The Sack? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (SBU) During his visit, Bugat was reminded that Betram 
Goldschmidt, the late pioneer of the French nuclear program, 
had remarked in 1992 at Kovalan, near Chennai, that \"France 
and India were prepared to flirt with each other but not 
really go to bed\" in nuclear matters.  Bugat was asked 
whether the time was now ripe for the two countries to \"go 
to bed\" in nuclear matters, especially light water reactors. 
The Hindu quotes Bugat as saying, \"I cannot say.  We can go 
to bed if diplomats and politicians come to a new round of 
agreements.  There are certain ways in which nuclear science 
R&D is closer to political affairs than industrial affairs 
but we will not decide in the place of politicians.\"  Bugat 
concluded by saying that France appreciates the fact that 
India\'s nuclear energy program is \"comprehensive and 
coherent\" as it includes nuclear power reactors, research 
reactors and nuclear applications in other fields.  Bugat 
also said he appreciates that India has not been involved in 
any nuclear controversies concluding that, in his 
assessment, only India, France and Japan have comprehensive 
nuclear programs (to include breeding, reprocessing and a 
closed nuclear fuel cycle). 
 
Bugat Visits the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8.  (SBU) During his trip, on November 10, Chairman Bugat 
visited BARC at Trombay holding discussions with Dr. Anil 
Kakodkar, Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, 
Dr. S. Banerjee, Director of BARC, and Dr. R. B. Grover, the 
Director of Strategic Planning for the Department of Atomic 
Energy. 
 
The Visa Mantis SAO Program 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) The three to four week wait required to obtain 
Mantis SAO response for executives in Indian nuclear and 
space organizations together with the fact that approvals 
often come at the last minute or too late for Indian 
travelers to accomplish their missions in the United States 
is having an adverse impact on our relations with the Indian 
scientific community.  Specific examples are the visas for 
Kasturirangan KRISHNASWAMY (DOB 24 October 1940) and for 
Prem Shanker GOEL (DOB 20 April 1947) who were granted 
approval to travel to the U.S. on the very same day they 
planned to hold a meeting at Boeing Satellite System 
Divisions, and the visa for Sridhara Murthi Kuppam RAMAIYER 
(DOB 7 September 1950) which was approved on the day when 
traveler was already supposed to be in the United States. 
 
10. (SBU) There have been cases when travelers proposing to 
attend open meetings in the U.S. related to nuclear power 
were found \"inadmissible.\"  In particular, Atal Kumar GUPTA 
(DOB 27 AUG 1953), the Technical Service Superintendent in 
charge of Engineering Support at the Kakrapar Atomic Power 
Station and Pramod Kumar SHARDA (DOB 7 JAN 1951), the Chief 
Superintendent at the Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant were 
supposed to attend peer review training at the World 
Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) in Atlanta in 
preparation for an annual WANO experts visit to nuclear 
power stations in India.  The goal of such visits is to 
promote nuclear power station operational safety.  Gupta and 
Sharda were categorized as \"inadmissible\" under Section 
212a3A(i)(II) on 8 October 2004. 
 
11. (SBU) As WANO training in nuclear safety is not subject 
to CFR810 controls for export of information, and relates to 
a USG policy objective to promote bi-lateral cooperation in 
safe operation of nuclear power plants, prima facie it would 
appear that this denial runs counter to USG policy 
objectives. 
 
The Cupboard is Not Entirely Bare 
--------------------------------- 
12.  (SBU) Mission acknowledges and appreciates the 
Department\'s support in expediting some Mantis SAO 
processing.  We also understand that in some cases the 
problem of delays is due to late applications by Indian 
scientists, a problem we are seeking to address with the 
GOI.  The fast approval for Dr. Prem Shanker GOEL (DOB 20 
April 1947) and Janardhana EDDYA (DOB 1 November 1945) to 
attend a NASA workshop on \"Creating New and Sustainable 
Space Exploration\" is one example.  Another is the approval 
for Nuclear Power Corporation of India Chairman Shreyans 
Kumar JAIN (DOB 8 May 1948) to attend a WANO conference in 
Atlanta on November 2 and 3, 2004.  In Mission\'s view, the 
rapid processing of this Mantis SAO is a solid demonstration 
of USG good will in light of the recent determination of 
Section 212a3A(i)(II) inadmissibility for Gupta and Sharda 
above. 
 
Comment:  Giving Ammunition to NSSP Doubters 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) It is ironic that Raj held such discussions with 
the Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission, at the 
time he was denied access to the United States to 
participate in an open conference which is not subject to 
export controls.  Such denials give ammunition to Indian 
nuclear and space scientists who firmly believe that the 
NSSP is nothing but a sham, and therefore oppose efforts by 
political players like NSA Dixit to move ahead on our export 
control benchmarks and the NSSP process as a whole. 
 
14.  (SBU) A high profile case of ineligibility such as the 
Raj case points to the need for an inter-agency process that 
allows the SA bureau and other stakeholders to participate 
in the Mantis SAO process and review any recommended Mantis 
SAO denials before the decision is communicated to post.  It 
is also important that the Embassy fully understand the 
reasons for any denials and has a mechanism to provide 
additional input if a decision appears to impact other 
established policy objectives, such as the NSSP process or 
nuclear safety cooperation. 
 
15.  (SBU) We recognize that it will be necessary to deny 
visits, even for high-profile applicants, when serious 
technology transfer concerns exist.  When this happens, we 
need to be in a position to fully understand the reasons for 
the decision and to be able to put it in context for our 
Indian interlocutors.  Mission appreciates Washington 
consideration of this issue.

1.  (U) Summary:  The GOI used a recent visit by IAEA 
Director General Dr. Mohammed El Baradei to press its case 
for reform of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) requirements to 
facilitate India\'s cooperation with others in the 
international community in using nuclear power to fill the 
country\'s growing energy needs.  In Delhi, El Baradei met 
with NSA Dixit, FS Saran and other MEA officials with whom he 
also discussed Iran, and proliferation.  In Mumbai, he met 
with India\'s civilian nuclear establishment.  According to 
our MEA contacts, the IAEA DG indicated that India\'s 
engagement with the US is crucial to its hopes for enhanced 
international nuclear cooperation, and in this context 
welcomed recent progress on the NSSP.  End Summary. 
 
Full-Scope Safeguards: US in the Driver\'s Seat 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (C) In a November 18 meeting with PolCouns and PolOff, 
MEA Deputy Secretary (Disarmament and International Security) 
Naveen Srivastava reported that in both his keynote speech to 
Indian scientists and in meetings with GOI officials, El 
Baradei stressed the role of the IAEA in promoting access to 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, an objective that 
is especially critical for rapidly expanding economies such 
as India and China.  In meetings with the IAEA DG, GOI 
officials pressed for \"positive discrimination\" to enable 
India to safely develop its nuclear power program in order to 
meet its energy requirements while addressing global concern 
about greenhouse gases.  El Baradei agreed that nuclear power 
should be a larger percentage of India\'s energy mix, i.e., 
increasing from 3.4% to 25% of India\'s energy sources. 
PolCouns queried whether GOI officials asked El Baradei about 
options for reconciling this goal with the NSG\'s full-scope 
safeguards requirement.  Srivastava confirmed that they had, 
but El Baradei referred them back to the USG.  The Indian 
media note on the visit said the GOI \"emphasized that while 
there is a need to address the emerging concerns about 
proliferation...this should not impede the fullest use of 
nuclear energy by states with a proven record of safety and 
responsibility, such as India whose record in this regard was 
second to none.\" 
 
El Baradei Believes Security Drives the Iran Program 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3.  (C) On Iran, El Baradei told GOI officials that he 
believes security is best addressed \"by partnerships (between 
countries), not dominance.\"  He prefers to continue to engage 
Iran rather than refer the matter to the UN Security Council. 
 Because Iran is surrounded by hostile neighbors, the IAEA 
chief said that he believes Iran\'s nuclear objectives are 
based primarily on its security concerns and that its energy 
requirements are secondary.  The Indians reaffirmed their 
view that Iran should comply with its NPT obligations, adding 
that Iranian nuclear weaponization would be a threat to the 
region. 
 
State Support for Proliferators 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Regarding proliferation, GOI officials raised their 
concern about \"the receiving side, not the supply side\" of 
the AQ Khan network.  El Baradei outlined a network reaching 
more than 20 states, including some Western countries. 
According to Srivastava, the IAEA chief said he believed that 
Libya\'s involvement in the network may have been limited to 
one person, but contacts with the DPRK and Iran were more 
extensive than that and would have required state support. 
Adding his own comment, Srivastava stated that although El 
Baradei was careful not to say that Pakistani, DPRK or 
Iranian state structures were involved, \"that is clearly what 
he implied.\" 
 
US Engagement Crucial to India\'s Civilian Nuclear Goals 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  (C) El Baradei also told GOI officials that India\'s 
engagement with the US was crucial to its hopes for enhanced 
international nuclear cooperation.  In this context, he was 
pleased with the progress on the NSSP, according to 
Srivastava.  The Indians used the occasion to reaffirm their 
strong commitment to maintaining \"a pristine onward 
proliferation record.\"  In follow-up with PolCouns, MEA 
Director (Disarmament and International Security) Venu 
Rajamony confirmed New Delhi\'s recognition that Indo-US 
cooperation on the reactor island would not be possible as 
part of the first three phases of the NSSP, but would be a 
GOI priority for later phases.  PolCouns remarked that the 
NSSP is moving rapidly, noting that Indian Ambassador Sen 
optimistically hopes to conclude Phase Two by the end of the 
year (reftel).  PolCouns reiterated Washington\'s suggestion 
that India look to Israel as an example of a country that has 
benefited from stricter export controls because greater trust 
in their business environment has resulted in more high-tech 
trade.  \"But you haven\'t sanctioned them,\" Rajamony 
countered, adding that the NSSP will help to build an 
atmosphere of mutual trust between the US and India.  He 
remarked that NSSP issues will likely be addressed in the 
upcoming India-Israel non-proliferation dialogue.

1.  (C) Summary:  Former DPM LK Advani has failed to quell 
the powerful centrifugal forces that threaten to tear apart 
the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the 
party is continuing a downward spiral that threatens to doom 
its immediate electoral chances.  The Sangh Parivar (family 
of Hindu organizations) insists that the BJP return to 
Hindutva, while party pragmatists argue for a 
development-oriented election strategy.  The BJP\'s secular 
NDA allies, who want no part of Hindutva, are increasingly 
disaffected, contributing to growing rumors of future 
defections to the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA). 
Former PM Vajpayee is in poor health and has faded from 
active politics, and the aging Advani is no longer the \"iron 
man.\"  The lack of a clear successor to these two BJP 
standard-bearers has set off growing battles between the 
party\'s second tier leadership, personified by the flamboyant 
and erratic behavior of the former Chief Minister of Madhya 
Pradesh (MP) Uma Bharti.  The BJP needs electoral success to 
revive, but the prospects are not good.  Continued defeats 
will tempt the party to increasingly resort to a hard line 
and irresponsible rhetoric, including on issues of US/India 
relations.  End Summary. 
 
Back to the Future 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C) The past six months have seen the unremitting decline 
of the BJP.  Prior to the May parliamentary contest, Party 
standard-bearer and then Deputy PM LK Advani staked his 
reputation on a nationwide tour aimed at invigorating 
grass-roots support.  Not only did it fail to inspire, but 
the BJP lost power, falling to only 10 Lok Sabha seats from 
its previous 32 in the key Hindi heartland state of Uttar 
Pradesh (UP).  Party morale plummeted and BJP front 
organizations, such as the Youth Wing became moribund.  When 
the party failed to knock the Congress/Nationalist Congress 
Party (NCP) combine from power in the Maharashtra state 
election in early October, it replaced Party President 
Venkaiah Naidu with Advani, in hopes that he would reverse 
the trend. 
 
3.  (C) Advani assumed the leadership of a deeply divided 
party.  Factionalism became rampant after the electoral 
defeats.  Advani has waited six years to become PM, but with 
his party in the political wilderness, there is little 
prospect for a quick return to power.  This has invigorated 
the party\'s second tier leadership, who began to openly fight 
over the top spots.  Tasked with ending the squabbling, 
restoring party discipline, and working with the secular 
parties in the NDA to win upcoming state elections in Bihar, 
Jharkhand, and Haryana, Advani has made little progress, 
despite his best efforts. 
 
Uma as Figurehead 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C) The BJP\'s problems are personified in the behavior 
and fortunes of Uma Bharti, the former Chief Minister of MP. 
Bharti, an OBC (other backward caste), is renowned for her 
ability to rouse the masses.  In a party dominated by upper 
castes, she is largely distrusted by the leadership, both for 
her low caste background and erratic personality.  Advani has 
long patronized Bharti in the hope that she could increase 
popular support and broaden the BJP\'s narrow caste base, but 
she remains notoriously unstable and unpredictable. 
 
5.  (C) Bharti resigned as MP Chief Minister following her 
indictment in an old public order case in October.  Although 
the BJP rallied around her and openly supported her 
subsequent \"flag march\" around India, press reports and BJP 
contacts confirm that she had made a mess of the state 
administration and the party was happy to see her depart. 
Upon taking over the party presidency, Advani continued to 
patronize Bharti, making her one of the six BJP general 
secretaries.  On November 10, the newly-selected BJP 
 
SIPDIS 
leadership met for the first time in front of television 
cameras.  Advani began to complain of \"indiscipline\" in the 
party ranks, chiding Bharti for her public criticism of 
senior leader Pramod Mahajan, and other BJP leaders. 
 
6.  (U) In one of India\'s more sensational \"tabloid TV style\" 
rows, Bharti then told Advani that she was the victim of a 
smear campaign orchestrated by unnamed BJP leaders in the 
Rajya Sabha, who \"did not have to face the voters,\" and that 
she was forced to \"defend my reputation.\"  When Advani said 
the matter was \"closed,\" Bharti refused to yield the floor 
and marched out, daring Advani to discipline her.  The 
publicly humiliated BJP triumvirate of Advani, Vajpayee and 
Jaswant Singh then dropped Bharti from the leadership and 
suspended her party membership. 
 
Hindutva Losing its Luster 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Since the BJP/NDA has been out of power, the 
hard-line wing of the Sangh Parivar has been reasserting 
itself, making repeated calls for a return to Hindutva. 
Advani, who is well-aware that the RSS supplies the 
disciplined base for what is an increasingly undisciplined 
party, has attempted to mollify the hard-liners.  Upon being 
named to the presidency, Advani assured party workers that a 
Ram temple would be built in Ayodhya, and attended the 
hard-line RSS leadership meeting in Hardwar on November 6. 
Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togodia told the 
press that he was not happy with Advani\'s actions and that 
the party must return to Hindutva not in \"months, but days.\" 
Togodia, other VHP leaders, and RSS leader KS Sudarshan 
showed their displeasure with Advani by staying away from the 
Hardwar meeting. 
 
8.  (C) Advani has not only failed to reassure the Sangh 
Parivar, but has alienated the BJP\'s secular NDA allies, who 
are increasingly alarmed at a possible Hindutva revival. 
Sections of the Bihar-based Janata Dal United (JD-U), headed 
by George Fernandes, are calling for it to leave the NDA and 
join the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) before the 
February 2005 elections.  Such a move could set off an exodus 
from the NDA, as other secular partners decide to switch 
sides.  On November 8, the JD-U passed a resolution reminding 
the BJP that it had joined the NDA only after its Hindutva 
planks were removed from the alliance platform.  Saying that 
it would \"never compromise with religious bigotry,\" the JD-U 
said it was fully prepared to \"take another road\" if the BJP 
rekindled Hindutva.  Advani met with the NDA leadership on 
November 15 and, in what most analysts saw as a BJP retreat 
from Hindutva, issued a joint statement that there should be 
a \"negotiated settlement\" of the Ayodhya dispute. 
 
9.  (SBU) In another indicator of the ongoing decline of 
Hindutva, on November 12, the Tamil Nadu state government 
indicted Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, a powerful Hindu religious 
leader, on murder charges (Reftel D).  Although the governing 
party in Tamil Nadu, the AIDMK, is part of the NDA, Chief 
Minister Jayalalitha told reporters on November 17 that \"all 
are equal before the law,\" and assured them she would proceed 
with the case.  Although the Sangh Parivar decried the arrest 
as an \"assault against Hinduism,\" its efforts to organize 
public protests have largely been ignored and public reaction 
muted. 
 
A Potential Split 
----------------- 
 
10.  (C) The Sangh Parivar has long threatened to leave the 
BJP and create a Bharatiya Hindutva Party (BHP).  Hard-liners 
within the Sangh Parivar are the principal proponents of such 
a split, arguing that a secularized BJP could then pursue a 
pragmatic development-oriented agenda based on the \"water, 
roads, power\" slogan, leaving the BHP with the Hindutva 
agenda.  The BHP would then join the NDA and work out seat 
adjustments and cooperative arrangements with the BJP.  These 
theorists contend that when the two vastly disparate 
ideologies are freed of the constant tension of belonging to 
the same party, they will be able to work together in harmony 
and create a broad-based coalition to bring the NDA back to 
power in New Delhi.  The Sangh Parivar has repeatedly paraded 
the BHP idea whenever it does not get its way on BJP 
decisions, and few take the idea seriously.  Should the BJP\'s 
electoral fortunes continue to decline, however, prospects of 
a schism will increase. 
 
Views of a BJP Insider 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (C) On November 17, BJP National Executive Member and 
RSS leader Seshadri Chari told Poloff that he was not worried 
about these seemingly ominous developments.  Chari claimed 
that the NDA was far more united and effective than the UPA, 
pointing out that the Left/Communists claim to support the 
UPA but act more like an opposition.  He observed that 
Congress and the BJP essentially agree on economic 
liberalization and most foreign policy issues, including the 
need for closer ties with the US, while the Left opposes 
practically everything the UPA stands for.  Chari argued that 
this arrangement is inherently unstable, could come apart at 
any time, and that Congress should be worried about the UPA\'s 
survival.  According to Chari, these problems are far more 
serious than those plaguing the BJP/NDA. 
 
12.  (C) Chari confided that the RSS wanted Naidu to remain 
as BJP President and was opposed to Advani\'s accession.  He 
contended that Advani, along with Vajpayee, is the most 
prestigious and powerful BJP leader and the party\'s \"trump 
card.\"  The RSS argued that pushing him into the top slot was 
premature and unwarranted, as it makes the party\'s problems 
seem more severe than they actually are.  In Chari\'s view, 
Advani has restored discipline, and convinced the BJP\'s 
second tier leaders that he is \"the first among equals.\"  He 
dismissed press reporting about Bharti, saying that the party 
never issued a formal suspension order, she had sent a letter 
of apology to Advani, and that she would be quietly 
reintegrated into the hierarchy.  Chari also denied that 
Hindutva was an issue, claiming that Indian nationalism and 
Hindutva are one and the same, and that the \"time for Ram 
temple politics has passed.\"  He predicted that with these 
problems resolved, the BJP would assume the role of an active 
and vigorous opposition party. 
 
13.  (C) Chari was less sanguine about BJP electoral 
prospects, admitting that it would be \"difficult\" for the 
party to do well in the upcoming state elections in Haryana, 
Bihar, and Jharkhand.  Admitting that UPA ally Laloo Prasad 
Yadav was well-entrenched in his state, Chari noted that the 
\"anti-incumbency factor\" could hand Bihar to the BJP and its 
JD-U allies.  In Jharkhand, the BJP is the incumbent and 
fighting alone against a powerful combination of Congress and 
the tribal-based JMM party.  In Haryana, Chari hoped that the 
BJP could entice the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) 
back into the NDA to recapture the state.  He conceded that 
should the BJP lose Jharkhand and fail to recapture the other 
two states, it would be a clean sweep for the Congress/UPA, 
and a crushing blow to the BJP, with long-term political 
implications.  Chari\'s hopes for a revived BJP/INLD alliance 
seem to have come to naught, as the BJP announced on November 
17 that it would contest the Haryana elections alone. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14.  (C) The BJP is in trouble.  The party\'s principal 
figurehead, former PM Vajpayee, is rapidly aging and will 
soon leave active politics.  Advani has long waited for his 
chance to become PM, but his age is also catching up with 
him.  The Party has not groomed a successor to these two 
stalwarts, and it is not clear that any BJP second tier 
leader has the gravitas and popular appeal of Vajpayee and 
Advani, and can supply the necessary counterweight to the 
growing popularity of Sonia Gandhi and her children. 
Personality clashes between ambitious second tier aspirants 
have only been contained for the time being, and the Sangh 
Parivar\'s determination to pursue Hindutva is contributing to 
growing disaffection among the NDA allies.  Advani, once the 
\"iron man\" of Indian politics, might earlier have resolved 
these problems.  Now, however he has only papered over the 
centrifugal forces that threaten to break apart the BJP and 
the NDA.  If the BJP/NDA does badly in upcoming elections, 
all bets are off, and the chances will grow that the BJP will 
stake out an increasingly hard line and irresponsible 
positions on issues of importance to the US, like economic 
reform, Indo-Pak relations, and the US-India partnership.

1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh Foreign Minister Morshed Khan\'s 
November 1 stop in New Delhi was officially scheduled to 
deliver India\'s invitation to January\'s SAARC Summit in 
Dhaka, but also provided an opportunity for bilateral 
discussions on festering cross-border issues.  The GOI 
resisted the temptation to use the visit to beat up on Khan, 
and this latest round did not yield any breakthroughs, but 
with a PM level meeting coming during the January SAARC 
Summit in Dhaka, it may have paved the way for a lowering of 
tensions then.  New Delhi has shown an increased willingness 
to share information with us about developments in 
Bangladesh, but like us is struggling to find a recipe for 
reversing the crisis of governance there.  End Summary. 
 
Only the Messenger 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) Morshed Khan came to New Delhi as the special envoy of 
PM Khaleda Zia to deliver India\'s January SAARC Summit 
invitation, and although the visit included the full 
complement of bilateral interactions, the GOI did not take 
him to task over allegations that Bangladesh is becoming a 
safehaven to Indian separatists and Islamic terrorists. 
Rather, according to MEA Director (Bangladesh) TS Sandhu, the 
GOI \"kept it positive.\"  Sandhu cautioned that Khan\'s 
forthcoming attitude would still have to be \"matched on the 
ground.\"  Border issues, including resolution of the 
undemarcated portions and coordinated patrols, figured in the 
discussions, but without resolution.  In India, Khan also met 
with leaders of the Left parties, whose main power base is 
West Bengal, bordering Bangladesh.  Sandhu thought this was 
an important exchange because that state\'s connection with 
Bangladesh could act as a buffer in the Delhi-Dhaka 
relationship. 
 
\"Growing Intolerance\" 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) Although he claimed to agree with PolCouns\' assertion 
of the US point of view that the overriding issue in 
Bangladesh is one of governance, Sandhu focused on \"growing 
intolerance\" as the most important concern.  He added that 
Dhaka is creating a \"breeding ground\" for forces inimical to 
the BDG and potentially India and the US.  Sandhu noted that 
the GOI would like to see the BDG at a minimum apply 
\"positive pressure\" against these groups and thought the US 
could be effective in helping Bangladesh \"see reality and not 
become boxed-in.\"  Like others in the GOI he was seized with 
the presence in Dhaka of ULFA leader Paresh Barua who he 
suggested had escaped from prison in Bangladesh by exploiting 
local political connections. 
 
GOI and UK Share Their Assessments 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF) Indian intelligence officials recently provided DIA 
a classified briefing on \"Terrorism in Bangladesh\" which 
offered some insights into Indian allegations.  The report 
indicated that the number of Jamaat Islami (JI) affiliated 
madrassas in Bangladesh has grown to 6,024 and reiterated a 
point the GOI had made to PDAS Don Camp in June that the 
jetty used in April\'s Chittagong arms haul was under the 
control of JI Amir Matiur Rahman Nizami.  The Indians also 
noted that Dhaka has called for the arrest of Bangla Bhai, 
the Islamist vigilante leader of the anti-BDG Jagrata Muslim 
Janat Bangladesh (JMJB) (ref C), but he remains at large with 
the aid of leaders of the governing Four Party Alliance. 
Intelligence officials cited a Saudi-based NGO, Al Harmain 
Islamic Foundation and Studies Institute, with offices in 
Dhaka operating in the capital and Cox\'s Bazaar.  The report 
concluded that democracy in Bangladesh has been \"jeopardized 
by fundamentalist elements\" and because of the JI\'s role in 
the governing coalition, the BDG cannot eradicate the 
extremists. 
 
5. (S) A report passed to us by the UK High Commission 
(strictly protect) corroborated concerns about the Cox\'s 
Bazaar region and foreign funding.  The GOI also asserted 
that the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) area is a base for 
Islamic extremist groups, including Al Qaeda, whereas the UK 
paper highlighted the CHT for not being home to such groups, 
although Chittagong and Cox\'s Bazaar are.  Rather than JI 
madrassas in these areas, the UK report continued, it is 
those linked to the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ, also part of the 
governing coalition) in which the problem is most acute.  The 
British report also noted the presence of Southeast Asian 
students in these areas. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) It will be interesting to watch how, if at all, the 
BDG response to Indian allegations of harboring militants 
changes in light of Burma\'s commitment to quashing 
cross-border insurgent activity during Than Shwe\'s New Delhi 
visit (ref B) and the seemingly connected crackdown in 
Manipur during the last few weeks (ref A).  The GOI\'s 
willingness to combine their allegations with specific 
information shared with us is an important move towards 
greater India-US CT cooperation in this area.  The 
inconsistencies with the British report, however, highlight 
the need for more ongoing dialogue with our various Indian 
interlocutors. 
 
7. (C) Khan\'s visit was his second to New Delhi since the UPA 
came to power in May, and in early January, Manmohan will 
meet PM Zia for the second time at the SAARC Summit.  If the 
PM continues his record of making last minute policy moves, 
as he did with the troop drawdown in Kashmir before his visit 
there, and the preferential trade agreement with Thailand 
when he reached Bangkok in July, continues, there is a 
possibility of a step forward in India-Bangladesh relations 
when the PMs sit down in Dhaka.  But for now, we have yet to 
see evidence that India and Bangladesh have found a recipe 
for reversing the downturn in their bilateral relations.

1.  (C) Summary: As India and Pakistan mark the one year 
anniversary of their Line of Control (LOC) cease-fire in 
Kashmir, more Indian troop redeployments and other Indo-Pak 
progress are \"only natural\" if cross-border terrorism and 
infiltration by Pakistan remain low, MEA Joint Secretary 
(Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K. Singh told PolCouns and 
Poloff on November 19.  Singh remarked that the ongoing 
redeployment provided President Musharraf with a clear 
example of progress on Kashmir to cite to his domestic 
critics.  He insisted that PM Manmohan Singh\'s recent public 
statements precluding redrawing borders or religious 
partition defined the parameters for progress in Kashmir. 
Singh also indicated a more flexible position on an 
Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline as part of a \"wide trade 
context\" for energy relations by declaring that Pakistani MFN 
status for India would be welcome but not mandatory. End 
Summary. 
 
Kashmir 
------- 
 
2.  (C) The PM\'s recent statements precluding redrawing 
Kashmir\'s borders or partitioning along religious lines 
authoritatively enunciated India\'s parameters for any future 
progress on Kashmir, according to Singh.  He characterized 
the recent troop redeployment as an example of progress on 
Kashmir that Musharraf can cite to domestic critics. 
Although the recent troop redeployment announced prior to the 
PM\'s visit to Kashmir was a one time plan, Singh said it was 
\"only natural\" to expect more such progress down the line. 
If infiltration remains low, he suggested, the logic of the 
PM\'s declaration suggests that India can withdraw more 
troops.  He said the onus was on Pakistan now to continue the 
process of ultimately ending infiltration, without which 
there would be \"no reason\" for troops to remain.  Singh 
agreed that the one-year anniversary of the LOC cease-fire 
was significant, commenting that the Composite Dialogue could 
continue \"indefinitely\" provided there is no increase in 
infiltration or major terrorist event. 
 
3.  (C) Responding to our characterization of Pakistani 
Ambassador Aziz is an \"ally\" in the Indo-Pak process, Singh 
said he was not confident in Aziz or the GOP MFA generally, 
labeling it as \"more conservative\" than the army.  Regarding 
the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Singh said 
Pakistan \"overplayed its hand just like they did with the 
Taliban.\" The Joint Secretary remarked that the GOI had given 
the Hurriyat \"a long rope which has now reached the tension 
point\" and \"one more tug will break\" it. 
 
4.  (C) Singh shared with PolCouns (septel) a list of 98 
suggestions India put forward for Indo-Pak cooperation, which 
also indicates areas of Pakistani inaction or delay.  He 
stated that 13 CBMs were agreed, India has enacted 20 
unilaterally, 20 are under discussion, and that Islamabad has 
not responded to the rest. 
 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Singh argued that the wrangling over permissible 
documents to enable travel across the LOC was a convenient 
excuse used by Pakistan to delay the opening of the 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route.  He cited various groups, 
including Kashmiri journalists, who already travel across the 
border with standard passports and visas to argue that 
nothing else was necessary.  He denied plans for any 
alternative document. 
 
Pipeline 
-------- 
 
6.  (C) Singh indicated new flexibility in the GOI position 
on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, specifically stating 
that the GOI no longer will require that Islamabad grant New 
Delhi MFN status in exchange for a pipeline deal.  He 
reiterated India\'s requirements that the pipeline be part of 
a wider trade agreement, must be secure, and that Pakistan 
must give assurances of reliable gas supplies to India.  The 
GOI would welcome MFN status but would be satisfied if 
Pakistan makes adequate trade concessions elsewhere, such as 
additional products on the positive list for import from 
India. 
 
Baglihar Dam 
------------ 
 
7.  (C) Characterizing a \"Dawn\" article stating that India 
would complete the Baglihar Dam by April 2005 as \"hype\", 
Singh said he expected the dam to be completed no earlier 
than 2008.  In response to Pakistan\'s opposition of the 
project, Singh said the GOI had asked for \"substantive 
objections\" and had not received any response.

SUBJECT: INDIA SAYS SAFTA ON CRUISE CONTROL 
 
REF: NEW DELHI 7395 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) Summary: The GOI is heading into the January SAARC 
Summit in Dhaka upbeat about having maintained an ambitious 
SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area) negotiating schedule that 
aims to have a document ready for member ratification by mid 
2005.  This optimism has prevailed despite apprehension in 
New Delhi over Bangladesh\'s SAARC chairmanship and modest 
expectations for immediate deliverables.  As a side effect of 
progress on SAFTA, New Delhi is taking a low key approach to 
the question of most-favored nation (MFN) status with 
Pakistan on the assumption that a SAARC-wide FTA will 
\"finesse\" the problem away.  In a November 22 meeting with 
PolCouns, the MEA welcomed the prospect of a USAID funded 
SAFTA technical assessment while emphasizing the need for 
outside parties to work directly with the SAARC Secretariat 
to avoid giving the impression of meddling.  End Summary. 
 
Running With SAFTA 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) In a November 22 meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, MEA 
Joint Secretary (SAARC) V. Ashok laid out the South Asia 
Association for Regional Cooperation\'s (SAARC) ambitious 
calendar for getting SAFTA up and running by January 2006. 
Pleased with the Association\'s \"untypical progress\" so far, 
Ashok outlined the timeframe for SAFTA noting that the sixth 
ministerial meeting will be held in New Delhi December 2-4 
after which, with two more sessions in Kathmandu and Male, 
the members expect to have a document ready for the July 
ministers\' meeting in Dhaka.  Ashok said this would leave six 
months for SAFTA\'s ratification and cabinet approval before 
the January 2006 target. 
 
Compensation Only a Speed Bump 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) While acknowledging that there are some conceptual 
problems associated with Dhaka\'s requirement that SAFTA 
provide compensation for revenue lost to LDCs due to freer 
trade, Ashok concluded that the GOI does not see this as a 
major \"stumbling block.\"  He noted that New Delhi came away 
from Bangladesh FM Morshed Khan\'s November 1 visit here with 
the impression that when Dhaka wants to move forward 
\"technicalities will be swept under the carpet.\" 
 
MFN Through the Back Door 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Ashok confirmed PolCouns\' suggestion that the GOI 
appears to have become more flexible in its preference that 
MFN status with Pakistan be a part of any Iran-Pakistan-India 
pipeline deal (reftel).  He explained that the view in New 
Delhi is that if the members agree to SAFTA as it is on paper 
now, \"MFN will come automatically.\"  MFN has become 
symbolically significant in the Indo-Pak relationship, he 
suggested, while noting that during the course of SAFTA 
discussions, he has not heard any indication that Islamabad 
will try to withhold most favored nation status. 
 
Negative List Won\'t Trip Up, Either 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) His optimism unflagging, Ashok was confident that the 
question of negative lists would also be successfully 
resolved.  He explained that SAARC members have divided into 
two groups, one of larger economies (India, Pakistan, Sri 
Lanka) for which the Negative List must be around 20 percent, 
and the second for which it can be slightly larger (in the 
23-24%) in the final SAFTA framework.  In keeping with his 
upbeat theme, Ashok commented that the trend of regional 
integration was irreversible, and  noted wistfully that his 
position used to be considered a relaxing job.  Further to 
his point, the Joint Secretary added that his office will be 
moved out of its current crumbling annex location to the 
Ministry\'s main building, as indication of SAARC\'s upgraded 
status within the MEA bureaucracy. 
Deliverables in Dhaka 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) While Ashok did not expect any significant SAARC 
developments during the Dhaka Summit, he noted a number of 
pending agreements, one of which will likely be signed in 
January.  SAARC members have nearly completed a Customs 
Mutual Assistance Agreement, Ashok said, but have had some 
difficulty reconciling the draft SAARC document with the more 
comprehensive model provided by the World Customs 
Organization, of which all are signatories.  Also in the 
works are SAARC Arbitration Rules, a Multilateral Double 
Taxation Treaty, and a Promotion and Protection of Investment 
Agreement.  Ashok expressed confidence that the BDG would be 
successful in the chairmanship, noting that during Khan\'s 
visit, he conveyed that Dhaka was eager to perform well as 
SAARC president. 
Room For One More? 
7. (C) PolCouns noted the USG\'s discreet support for 
Afghanistan\'s inclusion in SAARC and asked if there had been 
any movement in that direction.  Ashok explained that the GOI 
would welcome the addition if Kabul applies for membership, 
and there is consensus in favor of it.  He noted that 
Pakistan had adopted a similar position, and suggested this 
would be a fruitful area for further work by SAARC members. 
 
SAFTA Support 
------------- 
 
8. (C) PolCouns shared with the MEA USAID/Washington\'s Scope 
of Work on technical assistance for SAFTA implementation, 
noting that this project reflects broad US support for South 
Asian regional integration.  Ashok accepted the paper and 
noted, as he recently told a World Bank representative who 
visited him on the same subject, that the GOI \"would be 
delighted\" to have such support, but outside parties ought to 
work with the SAARC Secretariat to avoid giving the 
impression of \"dictating to\" the members.  He advised that it 
would be best for the USAID team to first approach the SAARC 
Secretariat to get ideas from them, thereby making it a SAARC 
 
SIPDIS 
initiative. 
 
In Tatas We Trust 
----------------- 
 
9. (C) Pinning his bilateral hopes on the Tata Corporation\'s 
proposed USD 2 billion investment in Bangladesh, Ashok 
commented that it is a \"way to short-circuit governmental 
shortcomings\" in the India-Bangladesh relationship.  He noted 
that a company like Tata could be more effective there, as 
opposed to the \"bossy government of India,\" and predicted 
that SAFTA would compel the BDG to implement measures it has 
been unwilling to embrace bilaterally.

13 YEARS

Classified By: Charge Robert O. Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: India received Shaukat Aziz warmly and at 
the highest levels, on the first visit of a Pakistani PM to 
New Delhi since 1991.  The GOI went out of its way to project 
a welcoming message, because of the importance it places on 
reconciliation with Islamabad and because it sees Aziz as the 
kind of modernizing, pragmatic Pakistani politician India 
should bolster.  That the two sides were able to restore a 
positive atmosphere so soon after PM Manmohan Singh 
established clear GOI redlines on Kashmir on November 18 is 
important, and is viewed here as a Pakistani climbdown from 
the \"maximalist\" position that President Musharraf projected 
in his October 25 \"Iftar Musings\" proposal.  Speaking to the 
press after his lunch with the PM, Aziz declared that 
\"progress on other issues will be made in tandem with 
(Kashmir),\" implicitly validating the Indian claim that 
Islambad had put the brakes on people-to-people ties with a 
view to focusing attention on Kashmir.  The Pakistani PM 
spent more than five hours with four different Kashmiri 
separatist groups, separately, and did not succeed in 
unifying them, indicating that speculation about their 
impending reunification was premature.  Like Foreign Minister 
Natwar Singh, we expect no miracles from this visit, but it 
sets a positive stage for an intense three-week period of 
Indo-Pak engagement in December, Round Two of the Composite 
Dialogue (CD), culminating in an Indo-Pak meeting at the 
SAARC Summit in January.  End Summary. 
 
Warm Welcome; Berlin Wall Theme 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) After Shaukat Aziz went to considerable lengths in 
recent days to downplay General Musharraf\'s criticism of the 
GOI redlines on Kashmir that PM Manmohan Singh set out in 
Srinagar on November 18 (Ref B), official New Delhi went out 
of its way to ensure that Aziz will have a good trip to India 
on this, the first visit of a Pakistani PM to New Delhi since 
Nawaz Sharif attended Rajiv Gandhi\'s funeral in 1991.  The PM 
telephoned Aziz upon his arrival at the New Delhi airport to 
welcome him, commenting \"who could say some 20 years ago that 
the Berlin Wall would be a thing of the past.\"  Singh added 
that he \"hoped and prayed that we can set in motion a similar 
process in this subcontinent,\" and that he would \"sincerely 
work to that end.\"  Aziz reciprocated, offering special gifts 
to each of his senior hosts. 
 
Most Except Sonia 
----------------- 
 
3.  (C) The Pakistani PM met, or planned to meet, India\'s 
most important politicians and officials, with the exception 
of Sonia Gandhi, who became \"indisposed\" after initial 
indications that she would see him, according to a 
well-informed Indian journalist.  (Comment: Sonia has 
consistently declined to meet US and all other high-level 
foreign visitors to underline that PM Singh is in charge of 
the GOI.  End Comment)  He saw ex-PM Vajpayee, Leader of the 
Opposition LK Advani (who confirmed that he would visit 
Pakistan in January), Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar 
to discuss the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, Commerce 
Minister Kamal Nath, and industrialists from FICCI and CII. 
The large size of the Pakistani delegation, which included 
six ministers representing many of the substantive areas of 
Indo-Pak discord, several Senators, and several top 
businessmen, attracted major media attention. 
 
Natwar Singh 
------------ 
 
4.  (C) The MEA spokesman characterized Aziz\'s November 23 
45-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Natwar Singh as 
\"friendly, positive and forward looking,\" and indicated that 
the discussion centered around SAARC issues, inasmuch as the 
Pakistani PM was in Delhi in his capacity as outgoing SAARC 
Chairman, and the importance of showing results in Round Two 
of the CD process in December. 
 
Aziz Strikes out with the Hurriyat 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) As part of Islamabad\'s continuing efforts to reunite 
the warring APHC factions, the Pakistani PM devoted the 
entire evening of his first day in Delhi to the separatists, 
spending more than five hours with them.  Aziz first met with 
the moderate group, then JKLF leader Yasin Malik, then JKDFP 
leader Shabir Shah, and finally pro-Pakistan hardliner SAS 
Geelani.  A 30-45 minute dinner followed, at which the 
moderate, pro-Pakistan, and pro-independence factions met 
together for the first time in more than one year.  While 
privately annoyed at the meeting and the image of Pakistani 
meddling with \"India\'s Kashmiris,\" GOI officials maintained 
public silence on it. 
 
6.  (C) APHC leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who had expressed 
optimism to D/Polcouns on November 22 about the prospects of 
reunification, expressed disappointment that Islamabad had 
acceded to Geelani\'s demand to remain above and separate from 
the rest, and laid the blame for a lack of unity on his 
doorstep.  The Mirwaiz complained that Aziz had also not 
assured them that the Kashmiris would have an immediate role 
in the Kashmir-related aspects of the Indo-Pak dialogue, 
saying that this would have to come at a later stage.  Aziz 
also reportedly told them that the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus 
would become a reality \"soon,\" that there would be three bus 
lines, two from the Valley and one from Jammu, and invited 
them to visit Pakistan.  None of our interlocutors believed 
another Hurriyat meeting with Aziz would take place during 
this visit, as some media had reported. 
 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Aziz arrived as the Indian media reported additional 
steps the GOI has taken recently to set the stage for an 
opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, should the two 
sides reach agreement on modalities at the political level 
and at technical level discussions on December 7-8 in New 
Delhi.  India has been resurfacing a 12 km stretch of road 
near the LOC which has not been used for several decades, 
according to the Indian Express.  The GOI has also identified 
LOC crossing posts.  While the status of a bridge over the 
Jhelum River remains unresolved, the GOI has made 
preparations to erect a temporary bridge and to remove mines 
from the area in the event an agreement is reached.  One 
newspaper report speculated that India may not insist on 
visas for Pakistani visitors, but this contradicts what we 
heard from MEA on November 19 (Ref A). 
 
8.  (C) Speaking to the press after his lunch with the PM, 
Aziz declared that \"as regards to Jammu and Kashmir, we 
believe this is an issue and we all need to discuss and 
adddress (it).  Progress on other issues will be made in 
tandem with (Kashmir),\" implicitly validating the Indian 
claim that Islambad had put the brakes on people-to-people 
ties with a view to focusing attention on Kashmir. 
 
Pipeline 
-------- 
 
9.  (C) Although our industry contacts remain skeptical about 
a Pakistan gas pipeline, Aziz\' meeting with Petroleum 
Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar sparked speculation about a 
breakthrough there.  Pakistani Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokar 
was forward leaning, declaring that \"we see the gas pipeline 
as a major CBM, not just for India and Pakistan, but for the 
whole region including Iran.\"  Aiyar, however, pressed for 
broader economic rapproachement.  Meeting with journalists 
over breakfast on November 24, Aziz insisted that granting 
MFN status to India was linked to the solution of the Kashmir 
issue.  MFN status would open up the Pakistan market for 
Indian exporters, and would not be considered in isolation, 
he stated. 
Pakistan Watchers 
----------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) During a November 24 Charge-hosted lunch for 
visiting CODEL Bayh, the mood around Indo-Pak relations and 
the Aziz visit was generally upbeat, reflecting broader Delhi 
atmospherics.  However, this sense of cautious optimism was 
premised on the assumption that the Pakistani establishment 
had now abandoned the \"maximalist\" position reflected in 
Musharraf\'s October 25 \"Iftar musings.\"  Against this 
background, the Pakistan experts in attendance counseled 
against any talk of final solutions on Kashmir.  Under 
current circumstances, they argued, the two sides need to 
focus on \"process, not solutions.\"  Senator Bayh heard a 
general consensus that a final breakthrough on Indo-Pak 
relations will be possible only when a civilian government is 
installed in Islamabad, and on this basis advised a slow but 
steady approach. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) Like Natwar Singh, we also expect no miracles from 
this visit.  That the two sides were able to restore a 
positive, purposeful atmosphere so soon after PM Manmohan 
Singh established clear GOI redlines on Kashmir on November 
18 is important.  Significantly, Manmohan Singh\'s insistence 
that there can be no territorial changes on Kashmir was 
echoed in a November 24 op-ed piece by Prem Shankar Jha, one 
of India\'s most devoted advocates of Indo-Pak rapproachement. 
 As Jha argued, \"Islamabad\'s treatment of the LOC as Delhi\'s 
maximum position exemplifies everything that Delhi distrusts 
most about Pakistan\'s way of doing business.  The only way to 
bring lasting peace is to eschew final goals and concentrate 
on the process.\" 
 
12.  (C) Aziz spent an unusual amount of time with the 
Hurriyat, but his attempts to unify them failed, indicating 
that speculation about impending reunification was premature, 
and that the divide between the various factions still runs 
deep.  We expect most observers to judge the Aziz visit a 
success, as it launches an intense three-week period of 
Indo-Pak engagement in December, Round Two of the Composite 
Dialogue (CD), followed by another Indo-Pak meeting at the 
January SAARC Summit.  Septel will report CODEL Bayh meetings 
wiht senior GOI officials.

\"MODEL\" IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
 
REF: COLOMBO 1857 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Sri Lanka\'s President Chandrika Kumaratunga\'s 
November 3-7 New Delhi visit highlighted that Sri Lanka has 
become a model neighbor for India.  The President\'s stay 
included an address to a high-level conference during which 
she dismissed the notion that \"nothing was happening\" in her 
country\'s peace process.  The MEA announced the long-pending 
Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) was ready for signature, 
but did not indicate when that would be signed.  Officially, 
New Delhi has kept its hands off of GOSL-LTTE relations but 
the DCA will reverse that stance, Indian Tamils argue.  In 
attempting to restrict third party use of Sri Lanka\'s Palaly 
airfield that the GOI has agreed to refurbish, India is 
pursuing its objective of being the dominant South Asian 
power.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Despite keeping her VIP audience waiting nearly 30 
minutes, Kumaratunga\'s November 5 speech to the high-powered 
\"Hindustan Times\" leadership conference was well received by 
the Delhi elite.  Kumaratunga avoided any mention of the 
conflict in her own country, focusing instead on her vision 
for SAARC which she said could unify South Asia into an 
\"economic powerhouse.\"  Following the talk, the President 
dismissed the suggestion that \"nothing was happening\" in the 
peace process, and instead highlighted recent developments 
that gave her cause for optimism. 
 
Model Relationship 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) The MEA told us that \"nothing new\" came up during 
Kumaratunga\'s GOI discussions.  In a November 17 conversation 
with Poloff, Deputy Secretary (Sri Lanka) Anupam Rai called 
India-Sri Lanka \"one relationship in the neighborhood that is 
really moving,\" adding that \"politically, we are closer than 
ever.\"  Rai remarked that \"the Sri Lanka relationship could 
serve as a model for our other relationships in the 
neighborhood.\"  Emphasizing the contrast between Colombo and 
India\'s other neighbors, he noted that \"as opposed to 
building barriers, like Bangladesh and Pakistan, Sri Lankans 
are the only guys who are walking the talk of building strong 
ties.\"  In a statement after the Kumaratunga visit, the MEA 
also expressed pleasure at \"Sri Lanka\'s endorsement of 
India\'s candidature for permanent membership of the UNSC.\" 
 
Defense Agreement 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) Describing the long-awaited India-Sri Lanka Defense 
Cooperation Agreement (DCA) as an \"international safety net,\" 
Rai remarked simply that its purpose was to \"institutionalize 
defense cooperation.\"  Indo-Asian News Service News Editor 
(and Prabhakaran biographer) Narayan Swamy explained that the 
agreement provided the only surprise of Kumaratunga\'s visit, 
as she was expected to sign it while in New Delhi.  Swamy 
explained that the LTTE opposes such a formalization between 
India and Sri Lanka because it would \"redistribute the 
equilibrium between the Tigers and the GOSL.\"  Freelance 
commentator Maj. Gen. Ashok Mehta (Ret) agreed, noting that 
the LTTE have said such an agreement will go against the 
peace process.  He added that the DCA will be a \"deterrent\" 
to the LTTE from continuing to pursue a military course. 
 
5. (C) As to the status of the DCA, Sri Lankan High 
Commission First Secretary Saj Mendis (protect) told Poloff 
that the documents are being prepared for signature.  General 
Mehta gave us a different view, observing that the agreement 
still had to be approved by the Indian cabinet, and 
predicting that the process may not go smoothly due to 
resistance from South Indian Tamil parties in the governing 
coalition.  Institute for Conflict Management (ICM) 
researcher Saji Cherian noted recently that the leader of the 
pro-LTTE MDMK party, Vaiko, had met with PM Manmohan Singh to 
\"express his disapproval.\"  Journalist Swamy asserted that 
the LTTE position would not dissuade the GOI from finalizing 
the process. 
 
Hands Off, Eyes Open 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOI maintains that \"any request for Indian 
participation in the peace process would have to be 
considered carefully.\"  According to the MEA\'s Rai, 
Kumaratunga described the process as \"neither going forward, 
or backward.\"  The GOI has concluded that the President is 
\"serious\" about moving ahead, and that India is willing to 
finance rehabilitation projects in Sri Lanka, Rai added. 
 
7. (C) Among India\'s development projects in Sri Lanka, Swamy 
listed the GOI offer to refurbish the Palaly airstrip 
(reftel), but noted that New Delhi has conditioned its offer 
by requiring that only India and Sri Lanka be allowed to use 
it.  Although the LTTE is concerned that the DCA will bring 
Colombo and New Delhi into a military relationship against 
them, Prabhakaran biographer Swamy insisted that the GOI 
would not contemplate a repeat of its 1987 military 
intervention in Sri Lanka.  In a November 23 essay, General 
Mehta came to the same conclusion, writing that \"India is 
still once bitten twice shy.\"  Nonetheless, the ICM\'s Cherian 
noted that since September both the head of India\'s Navy 
Admiral Arun Prakash, and the Chief of Army Staff N.C. Vij 
have traveled to Sri Lanka. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Sri Lanka has become a \"feel good\" relationship for 
India and the gushing public embrace Delhi gave Kumaratunga 
stands out among visits from the other neighbors.  The DCA 
demonstrates that India is not entirely content to stand by 
quietly on GOSL-LTTE relations.  The Palaly airfield 
agreement is a GOI attempt to wield even greater influence in 
Colombo.  Undergirding this rapidly thickening 
security/political agenda is a thriving commercial 
relationship that both sides see as beneficial.  As much as 
anything, it is this mutually advantageous economic 
arrangement that distinguishes India\'s relationship with Sri 
Lanka from its other South Asian ties.

1. (C) Summary:  In a series of senior level GOI meetings on 
November 23-24 during a private visit to India, Senator Evan 
Bayh (D-Indiana) heard a strong Indian commitment to move 
ahead with our bilateral partnership, coupled with concern 
about the potential disruptive effect of US F-16 sales to 
Pakistan.  Citing India\'s \"impeccable\" record of preventing 
onward proliferation, Foreign Secretary Saran advised that 
the US needs to bear in mind our shared interest in stopping 
the spread of WMD and to clarify whether India is part of the 
problem or the solution.  NSA Dixit made a similar point, 
urging America not to look at India as another Libya or Iraq, 
but as a democracy and responsible nuclear power.  Dixit 
characterized the \"theology\" of non-proliferation as the only 
difference between our two countries.  Echoing points made 
during his recent visit to Washington, Saran also flagged the 
Indian need to expand the use of clean nuclear energy, and 
sought flexibility on civilian nuclear supplies.  Senator 
Bayh praised the progress in Indo-U.S. relations on many 
fronts, but noted that U.S. intelligence experts would like 
to deepen operational cooperation.  The Senator also made a 
strong pitch for enhanced IPR protection.  End Summary. 
 
F.M. NATWAR SINGH 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) Indo-US Relations: After welcoming Senator Bayh, 
Foreign Minister Singh hailed the good momentum in Indo-Pak 
relations.  Infiltration rates from Pakistan have dropped, 
partly due to the winter weather and defensive steps taken by 
India, but also because the GOP has made \"some\" effort.  On 
Indo-U.S. relations Singh laughingly apologized to the 
Senator and said India was glad President Bush had won 
re-election.  He praised the President\'s vision for Indo-U.S. 
relations and said they have been moving forward since day 
one of the Bush presidency.  He recalled with satisfaction 
that the President had told the PM in September that India 
would be one of the first countries he visits if re-elected. 
The FM predicted Indo-U.S. relations will continue to 
improve.  But he told the Senator he wanted to flag one 
concern.  He predicted any sale of F-16s to Pakistan would be 
a \"fly in the ointment of Indo-U.S. relations\".  The key 
point for India is that F-16s can be 
fitted with nuclear weapons. 
 
3.  (C) NRIs:  Singh praised the success of non-resident 
Indians in the United States.  He recounted how Indian steel 
tycoon Lakhsmi Mittal is now the largest steel magnate in the 
world.  Senator Bayh responded that Indiana manufactures more 
steel than any state in America, and that Mittal owns four of 
the state\'s five steel mills. 
 
4.  (C) No Clash of Civilizations: In response to a question 
from Senator Bayh about radical Islam, the FM noted proudly 
that India had proved Sam Huntington\'s Clash of Civilizations 
theory wrong.  India\'s Islam differed substantially from the 
Islam of Saudi Arabia or Indonesia.  Although India has the 
second largest population of Muslims, not a single one had 
joined Al-Qaida or the Taliban.  The Minister noted with 
concern, however, that the Madrassah \"movement\" is catching 
fire, so the issue of radical Islam affects all of us, 
including the United States where Islam is the fastest 
growing religion. Senator Bayh concluded by expressing his 
hope that the United States and India can work to enhance our 
long term mutual strategic interests, which he said are many. 
 
F.S. SHYAM SARAN 
---------------- 
 
5. (C)  Indo-US Relations:  Saran welcomed the Senator by 
noting that he had just returned from a productive visit in 
the United States, during which he had been pleased to see 
SecState designate Rice and enjoyed good meetings of the 
working groups on High Technology Cooperation (HTCG) and the 
Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP). He expressed his 
satisfaction with the higher than expected turnout of 
American and Indian business to the HTCG private sector 
meeting, which he characterized as \"on track\" to get tangible 
results.  Overall, he thought there is a strong commitment on 
both sides to carry  relations forward.  Now that landmarks 
like NSSP Phase 1 have been achieved, both sides need to make 
important decisions and turn words into action.  Given that 
India has had an \"impeccable\" record on proliferation and 
given our shared interest in stopping the spread of WMD, the 
US needs to clarify whether India is part of the problem or 
part of the solution.  Another challenge for India is to 
maintain economic growth rates of 7 to 8 percent per annum, 
for which its energy needs will be enormous.  Given 
constraints on conventional energy supplies and the global 
need to ensure environmental and climate sustainability, 
India has no choice but to resort to greater use of clean 
nuclear energy.  This could be an area for closer economic 
cooperation between the United States and India and the FS 
expressed hope that India\'s US partners could be flexible. 
The FS also recounted the potential for technology 
cooperation and co-production in the areas of information, 
defense, and bio-technology. 
 
6. (C) IPR: Senator Bayh noted that India\'s emphasis on 
innovation would require a strong IPR regime, which would 
find favor among potential US business partners.  Saran 
confirmed that many IT contracts already include IPR 
provisions and India was working on more comprehensive 
legislation that would be in place before the January 1, 2005 
deadline. He elaborated that India is one of the few 
developing countries where services contribute 50% of GDP, 
underlining the importance of IPR to Indian companies. 
 
7. (C) Indo-Pak Relations:  In response to Senator Bayh\'s 
question about Pakistan PM Aziz\'s visit, Saran began by 
noting while infiltration attempts had stopped, this was more 
due to Indian efforts to beef up the border fencing in key 
areas, improve its surveillance technology, and winter 
weather.  He said Pakistan had cracked down on some of the 
Jihadi groups inside Pakistan in part to satisfy American 
requests, in part because several had turned against 
Musharraf.  He cautioned, however, that the LET is still 
active, has no restraints imposed on them, and are \"more or 
less in the arms of ISI.\"  The FS also noted India\'s concern 
that the infrastructure to support cross border infiltration 
remains.  Nonetheless, India remains committed to take the 
peace process with Pakistan forward, according to Saran.  He 
reviewed PM Singh\'s recent visit to Kashmir and his reduction 
in the number of troops there which had played well in 
Pakistan, despite Musharraf\'s dismissal of the action as a 
\"cosmetic\" measure.  He expressed hope that India\'s action 
would help create \"a virtuous cycle\" in Indo-Pak relations. 
In response to the Senator\'s question about the internal 
situation in Pakistan, Saran said Pakistan should have faith 
in its people and that democracy was worth fostering to 
strengthen the fight against the Taliban and Jihadis. 
 
NSA J.N. DIXIT 
---------------- 
 
8. (C) Indo-US Relations: Dixit characterized Indo-US 
relations as on the right track. On the economic and 
technological side, he said India accepts that it must 
address U.S. concerns and provide the necessary incentives 
for U.S. businesses to come to India.  But India needs the 
U.S. to trust India a little more.  He urged America not to 
look at India as another Libya or Iraq, but as a democracy 
and responsible nuclear power.  Senator Bayh praised the 
progress in Indo-U.S. relations on many fronts, but noted 
that deeper operational intelligence cooperation would be 
desirable.  Dixit acknowledged that operational cooperation 
is \"not there yet,\" but he predicted great potential for such 
cooperation as the campaign against terror and organized 
crime proceeds, and as the need for greater maritime security 
cooperation grows.  He pledged that as long as the current 
Congress government is in place, it will work toward greater 
cooperation with the U.S. in these areas.  He told the 
Senator that the FBI and CIA already have good interaction 
with their Indian counterparts and expressed appreciation for 
recent CIA information and security advice regarding 
potential security threats to the PM during his trip to 
Kashmir.  He observed there is no conflict between U.S. and 
India in any field; the only difference is in the \"theology\" 
of nonproliferation. Senator Bayh saw India\'s rise as an 
economic and strategic power as inevitable and said U.S. 
wants to help India emerge as a great and responsible world 
power, and in helping to resolve the Kashmir problem.  Dixit 
responded that the U.S. has a role as a friend and 
facilitator and that the U.S. has emerged as a high priority 
in India\'s foreign, economic and security policies. 
 
9. (C) Iran: Dixit took the opportunity to urge that the 
United States not pursue too punitive a policy with Iran as 
that would only strengthen hard-liners there.  Recalling his 
visit to Tehran in October, Dixit recounted that the Iranian 
President and Foreign Minister had told him Iran will sign 
additional safeguard agreements if deliberations continue 
within the IAEA.  However, if the matter is referred to the 
UN Security Council, Iran may 
reject all cooperation with the IAEA.  The NSA averred that 
the international community should not be blackmailed, but 
does need to encourage the forces of reason and moderation in 
Iran.  Senator Bayh responded that there is strong bipartisan 
support for sanctions against Iran and skepticism that Iran 
is not seeking nuclear weapons. 
 
10. (U) Senator Bayh\'s staff cleared this cable.

SUBJECT: THE GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLES THE CABINET TO SHORE UP 
THE RULING COALITION 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoffrey Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (SBU) On November 26 PM Singh announced a mini-cabinet 
shuffle, the first since the United Progressive Alliance 
(UPA) government took office over six months ago.  Looking 
ahead to state elections early next year Shibu Soren, the 
controversial chief of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha 
party, returned as Minister of Coal.  The Minister of Labor 
and Employment, Sis Ram Ola, was named to head the 
newly-created Ministry of Mines.  Minister without portfolio 
and head of the regional Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) K. 
Chandrasekhara Rao was given the Labor portfolio.  The 
President swore in the three new ministers on November 27. 
Notably missing from the long anticipated cabinet reshuffle 
was the controversial Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who 
remains in place. 
 
2.  (U)  Soren was originally named to the cabinet as 
Minister of Coal when the UPA assumed power six months ago. 
However, he was forced to resign on July 24 after a court in 
his home state of Jharkhand issued a warrant for his arrest 
in a 20 year old murder case.  Soren then dropped from sight 
for several months before surrendering, spending a month in 
jail and being granted bail.  His case is still pending.  On 
November 27, BJP spokesman and General Secretary Arun Jaitley 
told reporters that his party would raise the issue of 
Soren\'s reinduction when Parliament convenes on December 6, 
but would not disrupt the session as it had done previously. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
3.  (C) Soren is accused of masterminding a \"massacre\" of his 
political opponents in Jharkhand twenty years ago, and many 
say he is guilty.  Even if he escapes prosecution in that 
case, he is also accused of ordering the murder of his 
personal assistant and could be arrested in that case soon. 
PM Singh has a reputation for probity and reportedly opposed 
bringing Soren into the cabinet, but felt compelled to do so 
by the pressures of coalition politics.  With Soren back on 
board, the JMM and Congress can now form an alliance in 
Jharkhand that will likely defeat the BJP government there 
and give the state to the UPA in the February 2005 elections. 
 Likewise, Rao\'s TRS had threatened to withdraw from the UPA 
if it did not separate Telangana from Karnataka and create a 
new state.  Rather than give in to the TRS, Congress agreed 
to set up a sub-committee to look into the issue and placated 
Rao by giving him a Cabinet portfolio. 
 
4.  (SBU) Although the Labor Ministry has oversight of our 
$20 million child labor elimination project, we do not expect 
the change of ministers to have any impact on that effort or 
other US interests in India.  The Coal Mine Safety and Health 
bilateral project will be ending in January and this shake-up 
will likely not affect its success either.

SUBJECT: BJP ASSAILS CONGRESS OVER PAKISTAN F-16 SALES 
 
REF: NEW DELHI 7389 
 
Classified By: Charge Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (U) In its recent national meeting in Ranchi, Jharkhand, 
the BJP National Executive for the first time attacked the 
United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government\'s foreign 
policy, assailing in particular the Congress\' mismanagement 
of the Pakistan F-16\'s issue.  In its November 29 \"Resolution 
on Some Current Issues in Foreign Policy,\" the BJP takes aim 
at India\'s relationship with Pakistan and criticizes both the 
UPA government and the USG.  The document describes the 
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government\'s 1998 nuclear 
test as a \"sterling achievement,\" as well as India\'s ability 
to meet \"the challenge of economic sanctions,\" and establish 
\"healthy and fruitful relations with \"the USA, the EU, 
Russia, Japan, ASEAN and other countries.\" 
 
2.  (U) The Resolution lists the NDA\'s Pakistan policy as its 
greatest foreign policy achievement.  Citing the joint press 
conference by PM Vajpayee and President Musharraf in 
Islamabad on January 6, 2004 as a moment of \"historic 
significance,\" the document claims that it served as the 
\"basis of further dialogue between India and Pakistan.\"  It 
contrasts this achievement against what it describes as the 
UPA government\'s \"inept handling\" of India/Pakistan 
relations.  The BJP claims that the UPA has done nothing to 
stop Pakistani infiltration of terrorists into India, and 
that \"the infrastructure of terrorism remains intact in 
Pakistan and PAK Occupied Kashmir,\" while the India/Pakistan 
dialogue has \"become wholly Jammu and Kashmir-centric.\" 
 
3.  (U) The Resolution reminds the USG that it must \"ensure 
that it does nothing to derail the delicate peace process 
between the two countries,\" and condemns the \"decision of the 
US Government to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan in the 
name of fighting terrorism.\"  Alleging that the US has agreed 
to supply F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, the BJP describes it as 
a matter \"of greatest concern,\" that will \"have the most 
adverse impact on the current India-Pakistan peace process.\" 
Noting that \"when the Vajpayee government was in office we 
had effectively persuaded the US Government to desist from 
such moves,\" the resolution condemns the UPA for failing \"to 
persuade the US Administration to desist from taking such a 
dangerous step.\"  The resolution hopes that the Bush 
Administration will \"not jeopardize the peace process between 
India and Pakistan, and the bilateral relationship between 
India and the USA, by helping Pakistan augment its offensive 
capacity.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (C) The resolution focuses primarily on the UPA and to a 
much lesser extent on the USG, largely to placate BJP 
extremists who have repeatedly called for the party to return 
to \"Hindu nationalism.\"  The conflict between the Sangh 
Parivar (family of Hindu groups) and BJP moderates has grown 
increasingly virulent and is threatening to tear the party 
apart (Reftel).  The BJP leadership is reluctant to return to 
the Hindutva agenda, fearing that it would destroy the NDA 
coalition and pave the way for electoral disaster.  A 
nationalist attack on Pakistan, the UPA and the USG is a 
low-cost way for them to assuage the hurt feelings of their 
right wing. 
 
5.  (C) As our GOI contacts have warned, the F-16\'s issue is 
taking on the same kind of symbolic importance here that it 
has in Pakistan.  Regardless of the merits of the case, a US 
decision to provide Pakistan with F-16\'s will be used by the 
BJP to assail the Congress\' management of India\'s foreign 
policy -- and in that regard will be a blow to those in the 
GOI who are trying to deepen our partnership.

SUBJECT: INDIAN JOURNALISTS RAVE ABOUT VISIT TO PAKISTANI 
KASHMIR 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Participants returning from a November 
19-December 1 trip by 26 Indian journalists to Pakistan have 
reported overwhelming popular support in Pakistani Kashmir 
for opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road.  The media 
representatives were generally surprised by what they saw, 
and noted widely diverging notions on the shape of a final 
settlement of Kashmir, including strong pro-independence 
views in Mirpur (less in Muzaffarabad), and a much-reduced 
terrorist presence.  We summarize the main observations of 
several of the participants, as related to us and reported in 
the press, for their insight on what the Indian political 
class is hearing from the other side of the LOC.  If 
travelers are correct about the strong sentiment in Pakistani 
Kashmir for roads to open, this mirrors the views of their 
cousins in the Valley, and endows the December 7-8 Indo-Pak 
talks on Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus links with special 
significance.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Organized by the South Asian Free Media Association 
(SAFMA), this was a return visit after a group of Pakistani 
journalists came to J&K in October under SAFMA auspices 
(Reftel).  Indian participants (including several Kashmiris 
who traveled with Indian passports) reported that the Lahore 
and Islamabad legs were useful for their opportunities to 
interact with senior GOP officials, including President 
Musharraf, and politicians, but were most enthusiastic about 
their travel in Pakistani Kashmir (Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, and 
Gilgit), which most had never seen before (a few had traveled 
to the state in past years, but none more recently than four 
years ago).  They were able to travel where they wished, but 
lamented that their full program allowed less time to explore 
their special interests. 
 
3.  (C) In conversations following their return, the Indian 
journalists praised the warm reception and hospitality they 
received almost across the board, and the access they were 
given -- to most of those they wanted to see except Hizbul 
Mujahideen (HM) supremo Syed Salahuddin (one visitor claimed 
he was axed from the program because Islamabad did not wish 
to admit that he was living openly in Pakistan).  Another 
traveler said the President of the Muzaffarabad Press Club 
praised the group for \"doing a great job to heal the wounds 
of a battered humanity.\" 
 
India and Pakistan: Open This Road! 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Kashmiri reporters told us their strongest impression 
was the yearning in POK for an opening of the 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road, hopefully to be followed by the 
Jammu/Suchetgarh-Sialkot, Poonch-Kotli, and Kargil-Skardu 
crossings.  An overwhelming majority of interlocutors in POK 
reportedly saw this as the most important CBM India and 
Pakistan could adopt.  There was no interest in using a visa 
and passport system, on the grounds that the LOC would take 
on characteristics of an international border.  Yusuf Jameel 
from the \"Asian Age\" said a large number of Kashmiris he met 
who had crossed the LOC since 1989 wanted to return to the 
Valley, regardless of the consequences, but claimed that the 
Fence was making it more difficult to do so. 
 
Other Observations 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Trip participants also made other observations on 
their experiences in POK, the most interesting of which we 
summarize below: 
 
-- Tahir Mohiuddin (Chattan/Srinagar) was impressed that he 
no longer saw militants traveling openly on the roads, as he 
had four years ago, an indication that Musharraf and the ISI 
were \"at least doing something against terrorism.\" 
 
-- V Sudarshan (Outlook) reported that nostalgia, hate, 
metaphor, reality greeted the journalists in Mirpur. 
Interlocutors reportedly told him residents of POK were \"not 
even allowed to go to Gilgit.\"  Other POK residents 
considered the governments in both POK and J&K \"puppets,\" and 
opined that the only way to determine the views of the people 
of pre-1947 J&K was to allow travel.  The Mirpur Bar 
Association President reportedly told him \"(we) are prepared 
to fight for 2000 years,\" to deafening applause. 
 
-- Shujaat Bukhari (Hindu) was struck by the size of the 
migration from J&K to POK since the insurgency began in 1989, 
observing that 35,000 Kashmiris from the Valley were \"eagerly 
waiting to board the first peace bus.\"  Migrants in POK 
complained about dreary lives, and thought of themselves as 
\"kings at home but dependents\" in POK.  The cease-fire has 
allowed them to travel up to the LOC to wave at their 
relatives in J&K, but go no further.  He reported \"hardly a 
voice of dissent\" over free movement between POK and the 
Valley, although there was no consensus on a final solution 
to Kashmir. 
-- Sushant Sareen (Observer Research Foundation, Delhi) 
reported widely diverging views on the shape of a final 
settlement of Kashmir.  He was particularly interested in the 
views of former Azad Kashmir PM Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan, who 
had changed his mind over time and now argued that \"given 
ground realities in J&K, there does not appear to be a 
permanent solution to the Kashmir dispute in sight.  Maybe we 
should only look for a series of interim solutions.\"  Sareen 
considered Qayoom the most realistic of all the politicians 
the group had met during their stay in POK, in that he was 
willing to consider other steps to improve Kashmiris\' lives 
before settling their final status.  Other politicians were 
\"caught in a time warp,\" or (in the case of the Amir of 
Jamaat in POK) were \"consumed by hatred of India,\" and 
strongly supported the jihadis, he stated. 
 
-- Other journalists reported a session they had at Azad 
Kashmir University in Muzaffarabad, where they heard strong 
pro-independence and pro-accession (to Pakistan) views (as 
well as complaints of large numbers of ISI agents in the 
auditorium, impeding free speech).  Advocates of an 
independent Kashmir told the Hindu\'s Bukhari that there were 
at least 16 cases of student expulsions there for these 
views. 
 
-- Indrajit Hazra (Hindustan Times) was amazed to see Tarun 
Vijay, Editor of the RSS weekly Panchajanya, \"barely able to 
hold himself back from launching forth on India-Pakistan 
amity.\" 
 
-- Hazra also reported that \"azadi\" (\"freedom\") is \"on all 
minds\" in POK, more so in Mirpur than in Muzaffarabad, where 
she noted a radically different tone, \"almost as if 
independence was an abstract afterthought.\"  Sareen commented 
that the pro-independence lobby is well aware that there is 
\"no question of Pakistan ever allowing control over Azad 
Kashmir or the Northern Areas to slip out of its hands.\" 
This prompted some to ask why India does not call Islamabad\'s 
bluff by conceding the plebiscite principle.  He reported 
that local journalists had described \"a change in mindset in 
POK in favor of independence,\" primarily as a result of their 
treatment at the hands of the Pakistani establishment. 
 
-- Several found significant improvements since previous 
visits 4-10 years ago.  They were impressed with 
infrastructure improvements in Gilgit.  A Jammu-based editor 
was amazed at the excellent roads and uninterrupted power 
supply (in sharp contrast to what Indians are used to). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) As with the October visit by Pakistani journalists to 
J&K, this visit was unusually successful in exposing 
influential Indian and Kashmiri opinion leaders to realities 
in Pakistani Kashmir, areas most know only from reading and 
hearsay.  A couple of the travelers considered the trip one 
of their most important foreign trips ever.  If participants\' 
dominant conclusion -- that there is strong sentiment among 
Kashmiris in POK for roads to open -- accurately reflects 
local views, it mirrors those of their cousins in the Valley. 
 New Delhi and Islamabad can ignore this popular opinion as 
they bicker over travelers\' documentation, but from the Delhi 
perspective the desire for people-to-people contact on both 
sides of the LOC seems strong.  This endows the December 7-8 
Indo-Pak talks on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus links with 
all the more significance.

1.  (C) SA/INS Director Blake and Polcouns used a December 2 
meeting with MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar to 
convey our disappointment at the recent GOI vote at the UN in 
favor of \"no action\" on the resolution concerning the plight 
of refugees in Darfur. Polcouns also urged further efforts to 
synchronize our approaches to multilateral human rights 
issues. 
 
2.  (C) Jaishankar was unapologetic about the vote, but 
agreed that more intensive consultations between New Delhi 
and Washington on such issues would be beneficial, suggesting 
that this dialogue be included in the next meeting of the 
U.S.-India Global Issues Forum in early 2005.  Jaishankar 
then warned that on some issues, such as Burma, Sudan and 
Iran, diverging strategic interests would lead New Delhi to 
dissent from Washington\'s approach.  He commented that 
\"sometimes principles must be tempered when larger issues are 
at stake,\" referring to the large capital investment the 
Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Videsh (OVL) has in 
Sudan and India\'s fast rising demand for energy. 
 
3.  (C) Jaishankar described Burma, Sudan and Iran as the 
\"three problem children\" in our relationship, and agreed that 
the GOI and USG should clearly communicate their respective 
interests and policies concerning these countries.  For 
instance, he noted that New Delhi has a clear idea of U.S. 
\"redlines\" in these countries, but the same might not be true 
of Washington.  He added, that if the U.S. knew the stakes 
the GOI has in Sudan the U.S. might better understand India\'s 
approach.  Although the U.S. and India often have different 
objectives when conducting bilateral relations with these 
three countries, both would benefit by sharing views and 
ideas.  Jaishankar and Blake agreed that it would be a good 
idea to have DAS/Joint Secretary level trips to each capital 
to discuss these issues. 
 
4.  (C) Reflecting on our increasingly substantive regional 
dialogue, he noted that sometimes regional bureaus in both 
bureaucracies appear reluctant to add a bilateral U.S.-India 
dimension to discussions that could complicate Indian or U.S. 
diplomacy.  He cited the example of the U.S. presentation on 
China at the recent Foreign Office Consultations, which the 
GOI found unrealistically sanguine about the 
Washington/Beijing relationship and Chinese intentions.

1.  (C) Summary:  The report of the High-Level Panel on UN 
Reform represents the beginning of a long-term process in 
which India has significant stakes, MEA Joint Secretary (UN 
Political) BS Prakash told PolCouns on December 3. 
Downplaying FM Natwar Singh\'s apparent rejection of a 
permanent Security Council seat without a veto during 
December 2 remarks before Parliament, Prakash took a more 
nuanced view, saying India would deliberate carefully over 
the range of issues addressed in the report before reaching 
any conclusions.  While a permanent seat is broadly supported 
by all facets of the Indian political establishment, 
Opposition parties could use a veto-less Security Council 
seat as a means of attacking the UPA-government.  The 
Congress-led government will also likely have to contend with 
public concerns about \"second-class status\" should a 
permanent seat without a veto become an option.  Still, given 
the symbolic importance India attaches to a Security Council 
seat, New Delhi would probably in the end be content with 
permanent membership with or without veto authority. End 
Summary. 
 
Panel Report Just the Beginning 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The report of the High-Level Panel on UN Reform 
represents the beginning of a long-term process in which 
India has significant stakes, MEA Joint Secretary (UN 
Political) BS Prakash told PolCouns on December 3.  Prakash 
downplayed FM Natwar Singh\'s December 2 comments before 
Parliament in which he said that a Security Council Seat 
without a veto \"would not be acceptable to the country,\" 
emphasizing that the GOI plans to take a deliberative 
approach to the report and UN reform.  Despite some initial 
press reports and political criticism of what is being 
described as the \"second-class status\" of veto-less permanent 
membership, Prakash noted that Security Council reform is 
only one aspect of the report, and noted that the panel\'s 
mandate included a review of the entire UN system. 
 
3.  (C) Prakash said that India would probably release a 
statement on the overall work of the panel within the next 
few days, but did not feel obliged to respond collaboratively 
with the G-4 (Brazil, Germany, Indian, and Japan) on specific 
panel recommendations.  The G-4 did release a very general 
coordinated statement on December 3 urging the international 
community \"to embrace this opportunity wholeheartedly to 
bring about the needed change\" in the UN, and reiterating the 
need for Security Council expansion.  MEA Director (UN 
Political) Pankaj Sharma underlined to Poloff New Delhi\'s 
commitment to solidarity with the other candidate countries, 
saying that India would reject any outcome that excludes 
Brazil, Germany, or Japan from permanent membership. 
 
\"By Any Objective Measure, India Deserves a Seat\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.  (C) Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, speaking before the 
release of the report, noted that \"in terms of demography, 
contributions to peacekeeping or abilities at furtherance of 
the objectives of the UN, India more than fulfills the 
criterion\" for permanent membership on the UN Security 
Council.  MEA Director (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma echoed 
this view, stating that while the GOI views UN Security 
Council (UNSC) reform as one component of UN reform, and \"not 
an end in itself,\" New Delhi clearly believes that the time 
has come for India to join the ranks of the Security Council 
as a permanent member.  India has the will and capacity to 
contribute to the UN, he said, describing the current 
Security Council configuration as lacking the ability to 
respond to the realities of today\'s post Cold War world.  The 
Council is \"frozen in time,\" Sharma complained, emphasizing 
that the UN must evolve in order to retain its relevance and 
effectiveness. 
What India Wants 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C) Despite GOI insistence on Security Council reform, 
India has yet to elaborate on the details behind its vision 
for permanent membership in the Security Council, or on UN 
reform more generally.  New Delhi has clearly stated its 
support for greater representation of the developing world, 
and its opposition to rotational or semi-permanent seats, 
arguing instead for the addition of both permanent and 
non-permanent members.  The MEA\'s Sharma claimed that the 
idea of a rotational seat for regional groupings like the EU 
\"would not translate in South Asia,\" as neither SAARC nor 
ASEAN qualify as a \"union.\"  He argued that Security Council 
members should have a global focus, taking into consideration 
\"the interests of the entire world,\" and observed that a 
regional seat does not \"pass this test.\"  Beyond this, 
however, the GOI position is vague. 
 
Mixed Messages on the Veto 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Responding to questions in Parliament on December 2, 
FM Natwar Singh stated that a Security Council Seat without a 
veto \"would not be acceptable to the country,\" but tempered 
his comments by observing that Security Council expansion was 
an \"extremely complicated issue with wide ramifications.\" 
According to J/S Prakash, Natwar\'s comments came in response 
to questions unrelated to the predetermined topic (PM 
Manmohan Singh\'s September trip to the US) for which the 
Foreign Minister had been prepared.  The Foreign Minister\'s 
comments were not the last word on India\'s view of the Panel 
report, he emphasized. 
 
7.  (C) Other MEA officials and GOI foreign policy advisors 
expressed surprise at Natwar\'s comments, and offered a more 
pragmatic approach to the veto.  Ambassador KV Rajan, former 
Additional Secretary (East), described a general Indian 
consensus that there is \"not a snowball\'s chance in hell\" 
that India will gain a veto in addition to permanent 
membership.   He commented that most GOI officials believe 
that permanent membership would be \"fantastic, even without 
the veto.\"  MEA Director (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma 
(protect) echoed this view, asserting (before Natwar\'s 
comments in Parliament) that India would not make veto power 
\"a point in our case for membership,\" given the \"ticklish\" 
nature of the subject.  He emphasized that New Delhi has no 
official position on whether veto authority should be 
extended beyond the P-5, but added, \"When the time comes, 
India will be prepared to discuss this.\" 
 
The Campaign 
------------ 
 
8.  (C) Illustrating the importance the GOI places on UN 
reform, particularly Security Council membership, the 
Congress-led UPA government has undertaken a systematic and 
largely successful campaign to garner international support 
for a permanent seat.  As part of this campaign, New Delhi 
spearheaded a coordinated effort among the G-4 contenders, 
and lobbied aggressively at the bilateral level. (refs A-C) 
With the notable exception of the US, India has requested 
support for its Security Council bid during nearly every 
high-level bilateral interaction, with countries ranging from 
Nigeria to Burma, Vietnam to China.  The GOI has also sought 
support from regional organizations, such as the EU.  The 
campaign has been largely successful, with dozens of 
countries expressing support for an Indian seat.  During a 
joint press conference with PM Manmohan Singh during a 
December 3 visit to New Delhi, however, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin stated that veto power should not be expanded 
beyond the P-5.  \"We believe it would be absolutely 
unacceptable to erode such tools of the UN,\" he said. 
9.  (C) To solidify its claims to the Security Council, the 
GOI has also begun to assert itself more visibly within the 
UN, particularly after suffering a humiliating defeat in the 
October 1996 election for a rotating UNSC membership. 
Viewing election to ECOSOC as a pre-cursor to Security 
Council membership, New Delhi lobbied hard for an ECOSOC 
seat.  GOI officials, including Natwar Singh, have 
interpreted India\'s wide margin of victory there (174 votes 
-- \"the highest number earned by any country\") as recognition 
of New Delhi\'s ability to mobilize a majority of UN members. 
 
Approaching the US 
------------------ 
 
10.  (C) According to Ambassador Rajan, the GOI remains 
unsure about the US position on Security Council reform, 
viewing Washington as uninterested in genuine reform.  For 
this reason, India has so far been hesitant to push the issue 
of UNSC expansion in a US-India context.  He said that some 
sectors of the GOI view US support for a Security Council 
seat as \"a litmus test of the strategic partnership,\" though 
most recognize the complex issues surrounding Security 
Council reform.  Former Indian Ambassador to the US Lalit 
Mansingh acknowledged that US support for India will be \"the 
deciding factor,\" observing that without US support an Indian 
seat will not become reality. 
 
11.  (C) In discussions with Poloff, MEA\'s Sharma sought to 
downplay the sometimes marked differences between the US and 
India at the UN, particularly on human rights issues, 
commenting that New Delhi and Washington agree on the need 
for an effective, credible, and efficient council.  India 
does not work in contradiction with US values, he emphasized, 
adding that New Delhi had often served as a moderating voice 
among the NAM and G-77 countries on resolutions targeting 
Israel. 
 
What About Pakistan? 
-------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Asked whether the GOI worried about Pakistani 
opposition to permanent Indian membership on the Security 
Council, Sharma stated bluntly that \"India is not worried 
about opposition, by Pakistan or any other country,\" adding 
that each of the G-4 candidates have some opposition.  He 
offered no strategy for overcoming opposition that could come 
from Pakistan, or from other Islamic countries, but said 
India was confident of receiving the two-thirds vote 
necessary to join the Security Council. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (C) For India, permanent UN Security Council membership 
has come to symbolize India\'s arrival as a global power, and 
for this reason has become a high-profile issue for the 
government and foreign policy elite.  Debate among the wider 
public is just beginning, and in this context Natwar\'s 
comments to Parliament further complicated the already vague 
Indian position on a desirable outcome for UNSC reform. 
However, it is probable that Natwar\'s remarks were made 
off-the-cuff and do not represent the official GOI stand.  As 
one of our contacts put it, \"By now we should all know that 
Natwar does not have the last word.\"  The Indian Government 
is likely to be satisfied with a permanent Security Council 
seat sans veto, but whether the public and Opposition parties 
will accept this outcome remains another matter.

1. (U) Action request for OVP.  Please see para 4. 
 
2. (C) Reflecting significant Indian interests in Afghanistan 
and GOI support for Karzai\'s re-election, New Delhi has 
designated Minister of State in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan to 
lead the official delegation for the December 7 Afghan 
inauguration.  As Minister of State in the Prime Minister\'s 
Office, Chavan serves as a go-between for Manmohan Singh and 
Congress President Sonia Gandhi, providing some of the 
political screen that Brajeh Mishra offered in the Vajpayee 
PMO.  A founding member of the Indo-US Parliamentary Forum, 
Chavan is a US-educated contemporary of Rajiv Gandhi who was 
a supporter of our bilateral relationship long before it 
became fashionable. 
 
3. (C) MEA contacts intimated several weeks ago that the 
timing of the Afghan inauguration, which coincides with a 
short and intensive session of Parliament, would complicate 
efforts to identify a suitably high-level leader of the 
Indian delegation.  The decision to designate Chavan (who 
will be sent as a personal emissary of the Prime Minister) 
reflects a typically Indian effort to split the difference, 
while avoiding the political problems that could result if 
Foreign Minister Natwar Singh was out of the country while 
Parliament was in session. 
 
4. (SBU) Action Request: As detailed septel, the GOI has just 
issued a Request for Proposal for 50 widebody aircraft for 
Air India.  US success in this major tender will require 
sustained high-level advocacy to balance pressures from 
European capitals, including from Chancellor Schroeder PM 
Blair and President Chirac, all of whom have weighed in to 
support Airbus.  In this context, Mission asks that OVP seek 
an opportunity for the Vice President to engage personally 
with Minister Chavan on behalf of Boeing.  All indications 
are that this tender is on a fast track.  The 
Vice-President\'s visit is an opportunity to convey a high 
level message that will go straight to the decision-making 
levels of the Indian government.

SUBJECT: INDO-PAK TRACK II EXCHANGES STRONG, MARRED ONLY BY 
DISAGREEMENT ON KASHMIR 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoffrey Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: As India and Pakistan move into Round II of 
their Composite Dialogue (CD), people-to-people exchanges 
continue at an accelerating pace, building goodwill, 
expanding non-official ties, and keeping up a positive 
atmosphere for formal talks.  The recent visit by Pakistani 
Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi to inaugurate 
the first-ever Punjab Games generated enormous good feeling, 
according to the Pakistani DCM, although Elahi possibly 
linked normalization of trade to progress on Kashmir.  During 
a December 2-7 visit to Delhi by retired senior Pakistani 
military officers organized by the India-Pakistan Soldiers\' 
Initiative for Peace, participants from both sides agreed to 
use their influence to further rapprochement.  Track II 
activists are slowly becoming conscious of the soft power 
they wield, and are eager to build support for the official 
dialogue.  Kashmir remains the dark cloud over these 
people-to-people exchanges.  End Summary. 
 
Progress in Punjab 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Punjab, the one Indian state where anti-Pakistan 
sentiments have traditionally been the most intense, recently 
witnessed unusual cross-border interaction, including the 
most important visit by a Pakistani Punjabi politician in 
memory.  Pakistani High Deputy Commissioner Munawar Saeed 
(protect) told Polcouns on December 3 that Chief Minister 
Elahi had an unprecedented reception from the moment he 
arrived in Amritsar, commenting \"I\'ve never seen anything 
like it.\"  He said the mood in Chandigarh was also very 
positive -- \"nearly euphoric\" -- an assessment echoed in the 
Indian press.  Elahi\'s later comment that trade between the 
two Punjabs will not take off until core issues such as 
Kashmir were resolved doused enthusiasm somewhat.  Even so, 
Elahi predicted that overall relations would improve, adding 
that PM Manmohan Singh\'s anticipated visit to Pakistan in 
2005 to go a long way in this effort. 
 
3.  (SBU) Continuing the successful series of Indo-Pak 
sporting events, particularly cricket and hockey, the 
first-ever Punjab Games (December 5-10) united more than 750 
athletes from the two countries.  Traditional Punjabi sports 
-- wrestling, field hockey and kabaddi (a team sport 
combining elements of rugby, wrestling and tag) -- and 
Olympic sports such as basketball, cycling, and marksmanship 
are on the program.  Although over 100 of the Pakistani 
athletes submitted their visa applications late, Indian 
immigration officials garnered goodwill by allowing them 
special entry through the Wagah border after its scheduled 
closing.  The Games are to be an annual event, with Lahore 
hosting in 2005. 
 
Old Soldiers Never Die -- They Join Track II Groups 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Another recent Track II event passed with less 
fanfare, but was reflective of broadening dialogue between 
the two countries.  Seventeen retired senior Pakistani 
military officers -- including lieutenant generals, admirals, 
and an air marshal -- were in India December 2-7 for meetings 
with Indian counterparts under the auspices of the 
India-Pakistan Soldier\'s Initiative for Peace.  At a 
closed-door roundtable that Poloff attended, speakers from 
both sides agreed that the peace process under the Composite 
Dialogue was critical to refocusing budgets from defense to 
human development.  Poloff was struck by participants\' 
comments that especially in Pakistan \"retired officers can 
impact policy.\"  The only stumbling point during the day was 
disagreement over whether Kashmir should be the first order 
of business between New Delhi and Islamabad, with 
representatives from both sides reverting to their 
governments\' traditional positions and one Pakistani 
brigadier asking rhetorically, \"If your Kashmiris are so 
happy, why not hold a plebiscite?\"  That brief flare-up soon 
died down, however, after both delegations agreed that they 
had more commonalties than differences. 
 
5.  (SBU) Former Indian Chief of Naval Staff Admiral L 
Ramdas, who brought retired senior Indian officers to 
Pakistan in 2001, headed the Indian side.  The Pakistani 
group included retired Corps Commanders LTG Nasir Akhtar 
(Karachi), LTG Humayun Khan Bangash (Lahore and later 
Ambassador to Turkey), and MG Nawaz Chaudhry, Defense Attache 
to the US in the mid-1980s.  After the roundtable, which was 
organized by the MOD think-tank Institute for Defense Studies 
and Analysis, the Pakistani delegation met with New Delhi 
Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, and a small group later saw Home 
Minister Shivraj Patil.  Their other stops in India included 
Amritsar, Agra, and Jaipur. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) These two events are the most recent examples of 
the proliferation of cross-border exchanges that are 
connecting Indian and Pakistani businesspeople, 
professionals, students, journalists, athletes, and others. 
We are struck by participants\' sense of the soft power they 
wield, which vests both countries in their ongoing dialogue, 
even as friction over the Kashmir dispute remains.  These 
events are also important in the Indian context as a 
reflection of the shifting politics of Indo-Pak relations. 
In contrast to past eras, when \"Pak bashing\" was a reliable 
vote getter, friendship with Pakistan has now begun to 
resonate politically, which provides an element of ballast in 
the recast peace process that was lacking before.

1.  (C) Summary:  The BJP is not taking advantage of the 
Winter session of Parliament (December 1-23) to demonstrate 
its effectiveness as India\'s leading opposition party.  Our 
conversations with senior BJP leaders in recent weeks 
indicate that the party is not addressing its internal 
problems and has no strategy to return to power.  It 
confronts the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) on the 
streets and in Parliament, but has yet to develop a positive 
vision for India.  Privately its leaders express optimism 
about the party\'s prospects, but concede that the UPA is 
likely to remain in power for some time to come.  The UPA 
record to date has not without problems and has provided 
openings for opposition attacks, but the BJP will not present 
a serious challenge to the government until it resolves the 
many internal problems it is sweeping under the rug.  End 
Summary. 
 
Parliament Gets Off to a Rocky Start 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) The winter session of Parliament (December 1-23) 
provides an opportunity for the BJP to demonstrate its 
effectiveness as an opposition party.  Its actions in the 
first few days of the session, however, revealed a party in 
disarray and searching for a coherent strategy to counter the 
UPA government. 
 
3.  (U) During the current session, Parliament is scheduled 
to address up to 46 bills on a wide variety of subjects, 
including the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 
(POTA) and a high-profile employment guarantee law.  MPs are 
also scheduled to discuss appropriate responses to increased 
attacks by Maoist groups, the prospect of talks between the 
GOI and Kashmiri separatists, ongoing violence in the state 
of Manipur, and the recent arrest of a prominent Hindu 
mystic, the Kanchi Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati.  Despite 
the packed Parliamentary agenda, expectations are low, as BJP 
disruption has prevented the previous two sessions from 
enacting much business.  Parliament\'s first day met 
expectations, as MPs from rival parties engaged in 
free-for-alls, forcing the speaker to dismiss the house 
early. 
 
Democracy: Not a Pretty Picture 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) During the opening session, members of the 
Bihar-based Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) made personal attacks 
against BJP President Advani, alleging that he had mistreated 
his daughter-in-law.  MPs from the Dalit-based BSP left their 
seats to loudly protest the recent arrest of one of their 
delegation in Uttar Pradesh (UP), called for the GOI to 
dissolve the state government led by Chief Minister Mulayam 
Singh Yadav, and only stopped shouting after the Speaker 
threatened them with suspension.  The Left/Communist parties 
accused the UPA of \"not consulting\" prior to increasing the 
price of petroleum products, implying that the price rise was 
unjustified.  The BJP accused Congress of betraying its 
election slogan of \"Congress is with the Common Man,\" before 
leading an opposition walkout. 
 
5.  (U) The arrest of the Kanchi Sankaracharya dominated the 
second day of proceedings, with the BJP raising the issue in 
both houses.  BJP firebrand Sushma Swaraj claimed to be 
\"anguished\" over the treatment of what she described as \"a 
2,500 year old religious institution.\"  Alleging involvement 
of the GOI and the UPA government in Andhra Pradesh (AP) in 
the Shankaracharya\'s arrest, she demanded the transfer of the 
case out of Tamil Nadu, and GOI intervention \"to ensure 
proper treatment\" of the Shankaracharya.  The UPA responded 
that it had nothing to do with the arrest, while the Tamil 
Nadu government accused Swaraj of \"misleading the house.\" 
Tempers ran high throughout the session, with MPs frequently 
interrupting speakers with heckling and catcalls. 
 
The BJP Takes to the Streets 
---------------------------- 
6.  (U) On December 1 the BJP, decrying UPA economic policies 
as \"anti-people,\" held a protest march to parliament.  In his 
speech at the rally, former PM Vajpayee said his government 
had kept inflation under check, increased the per capita 
income, achieved robust economic growth and launched major 
infrastructural development projects.  He contrasted this 
with the state of the economy under the UPA, which he claimed 
had \"no control over rising prices.\"  BJP leaders also 
criticized the UPA for distorting the Indian government by 
establishing a \"super Prime Minister\" (Sonia Gandhi), filling 
the Cabinet with corrupt and criminal ministers, and taking a 
\"soft approach\" to terrorism in J&K and India\'s Northeast. 
 
Uma\'s Letter Bomb 
----------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Another indication of the deep divisions within the 
BJP leadership was a letter written by BJP firebrand and 
former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati. 
Excerpts from the letter were published in the most recent 
edition of \"Outlook\" magazine.  Bharati implies that Advani 
who \"used to roar like a lion,\" has lost his charisma, while 
party General Secretary Pramod Mahajan has \"only one 
goal,...to come into power and then to make money,\" and 
former party President Venkaiah Naidu \"made menopause a 
national issue,\" when he cited his wife\'s \"illness\" as the 
reason for his resignation.  BJP leaders have insisted that 
Bharati is being \"rehabilitated\" and would soon rejoin the 
ranks following her recent suspension.  But her caustic 
letter attacks much of the party leadership in terms that 
would make further cooperation extremely difficult. 
 
8.  (C) Two BJP functionaries confirmed to us that the letter 
is authentic.  Bharati had written the letter and given it to 
a confidant to release to the press should her reinduction 
not take place, but he reportedly leaked it prematurely. 
According to our informants, Bharati was to be reinducted 
into the party as early as December 2, but when the letter 
was leaked, angry second tier leaders demanded that she be 
kept out, and Advani complied. 
 
The Hindutva MP 
--------------- 
 
9.  (C) Ramakrishna Kusumaria is a BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh 
(MP).  Known to be a follower of Uma Bharati, Kusumaria 
represents the Hindutva wing of the party.  In a conversation 
with Poloff on December 3, he blamed the BJP\'s 
secular-oriented moderates and their National Democratic 
Alliance (NDA) allies for the fall of the BJP government, 
saying they insisted on calling an early election and failed 
to present the party\'s \"values\" (Hindutva) in a compelling 
manner.  Despite this, he insisted the party would rebuild. 
He claimed that since the BJP represents Indian nationalism, 
its leaders reflect the country\'s religious values and that 
because \"time is on our side,\" the BJP will return to power 
stronger than ever. 
 
10.  (C) Pointing to the recent induction of Shibu Soren, who 
is under indictment for two murder cases, and other \"tainted 
ministers\" into the cabinet, and the increasingly heated 
dispute between Railway Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and 
former Railway Minister Ramvilas Paswan, Kusumaria alleged 
that the UPA is basically hypocritical and corrupt.  He also 
accused the UPA of claiming to be \"the party of the common 
man,\" while dismantling effective NDA programs that extended 
credit to the rural poor and developed India\'s 
infrastructure.  According to Kusumaria, the BJP is best able 
to tackle corruption and bring economic relief to the poor, 
and this will become clear to the voter. 
 
11.  (C) Kusumaria conceded that, the UPA will likely remain 
in power for a full five-year term, as the BJP will need time 
to \"rebuild.\"  He also acknowledged that Vajpayee will not 
return as PM and did not mention Advani as his successor. 
Ruling out the prospect that the next BJP PM will come from 
the party\'s secular wing, Kusumaria said it would be a \"holy\" 
person and the party would make the decision at the 
appropriate time. 
 
The Youth Leader 
---------------- 
 
12.  (C) Dharmendra Pradhan is a rising star within the BJP 
and was recently named to head the party\'s Youth Wing.  A 
native of Orissa, he represents a central Orissa 
constituency.  Speaking with Poloff on December 3, he called 
the UPA \"inherently unstable,\" predicting that it could fall 
at any time, and asserting that the BJP is ready to return to 
power at a moment\'s notice, with Vajpayee as its 
standardbearer.  According to Pradhan, the Left/Communists 
are the UPA\'s weak link, as they can bring down the 
government at will.  He claimed that prominent Left leaders 
told him they were \"disgusted\" with Congress and the UPA, and 
were only supporting them to keep the BJP out of power. 
 
13.  (C) Pradhan also claimed that Left leaders tell him 
privately that globalization is inevitable and they want only 
to ensure that its consequences are distributed fairly. 
According to Pradhan, the Left leaders are inherently 
parochial and only want to maintain power in their \"red 
forts\" -- Tripura, Kerala, West Bengal.  Congress must 
concede these states to the Left, he said, or they will bring 
down the UPA. 
 
14.  (C) According to Pradhan, Congress mismanagement is 
providing the opposition BJP with many issues.  He insisted 
that BJP would get lots of mileage out of the arrest of the 
Shankaracharya.  Noting that the BJP was an \"ideological, 
cadre-based\" party, Pradhan asserted it would find an issue 
to \"unite the majority community, (Hindus)\" and that once 
this is accomplished, it will have a lock on government.  He 
asserted that the BJP will continue to attack the UPA on its 
economic performance, and contrasted the treatment of the 
Shankaracharya with that of the \"tainted ministers.\"  How 
could it be, he asked rhetorically, that Shibu Soren is 
accused of murder and put on the cabinet, while the 
Shankaracharya is placed in a jail cell? 
 
15.  (C) Pradhan acknowledged that the BJP has not selected a 
second tier leader to fill the number three slot behind 
Vajpayee and Advani.  Like Kusumaria, he downplayed the 
succession issue, claiming that the party would solve it when 
the time came.  Pradhan also denied that there is inherent 
tension within the party between the Hindutva wing and the 
pro-development wing, claiming that the party supported both 
objectives.  He conceded that the BJP\'s behavior in the last 
two parliamentary sessions was a mistake, and predicted the 
party would behave in a more responsible manner in Parliament 
to address issues of government and national policy. 
 
A Response from Congress 
------------------------ 
 
16.  (C) Speaking with Poloff on December 3, Congress MP 
Rashid Alvi (a Muslim) laughed off the BJP challenge, saying 
that the opposition has only one issue and came to power on 
the public\'s momentary fascination with the Ram Temple in 
Ayodhya and the novelty of Hindutva.  In Alvi\'s view, such 
emotional appeals quickly fade, the public has lost interest, 
and the BJP has nothing else to offer.  He predicted that the 
BJP would continue to decline, and the NDA alliance would 
eventually break up and disappear. 
 
17.  (C) Alvi revealed that Congress is far more worried 
about Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP), than 
the BJP.  According to Alvi, Mulayam has approached DMK Party 
Chief Muthavel Karunanidhi to convince him to pull his party 
out of the UPA government and join with the SP to form a new 
government.  Karunanidhi\'s departure would leave the UPA 
without a parliamentary majority.  Alvi claimed that 
Karunanidhi was not interested in the proposal, which cannot 
succeed without support from the Communists.  Alvi opined 
that while some Communists have pro-SP sympathies and would 
like to sever ties with Congress and the UPA, most have 
discovered that Mulayam is an unprincipled opportunist and no 
longer want to work with him.  He predicted that the UPA 
would remain in power for the next few years and easily brush 
off BJP challenges. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
18.  (C) The BJP\'s behavior and the private statements of its 
MPs do little to convince us that the party has overcome its 
problems or has a strategy to regain power.  Instead, it 
continues to paper over factional disputes, disrupt 
Parliament, postpone the leadership/succession issue, avoid a 
decision on the next Prime Ministerial candidate, and defer 
any program to win state level elections in February 2005. 
Many in the BJP appear content to wait for the UPA to 
self-destruct or make a serious mistake that will provide an 
opening for attack.  The UPA has presented such opportunities 
in the form of price increases of basic commodities and 
nominations to the Cabinet of persons with records of 
criminality and corruption.  However, Indian voters for now 
seem unconvinced that the BJP has a better track record or 
will behave differently should it return to power.

KABUL FOR JIM ALVERSON (SECDEF DELEGATION) 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/06/2014 
TAGS: PREL, ENRG, KNNP, MASS, IN, India-Russia 
SUBJECT: PUTIN VISIT: FROM RUSSIA WITH TOUGH LOVE 
 
REF: A. NEW DELHI 7675

     C. NEW DELHI 5978 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s December 
3-5 visit to India did little to broaden their ties beyond 
defense, despite efforts by both sides to infuse the 
relationship with new momentum.  Both leaders pressed their 
issues with Russia extracting a promise from India to sign a 
defense secrecy agreement within five months, and India 
securing Russia\'s support for a UNSC seat with full veto 
powers.  Moscow, however, pushed harder and announced it 
would not supply another consignment of nuclear fuel for 
India\'s Tarapur reactor.  Significantly, Putin spent half his 
India tour in Bangalore with a view to securing a Russian 
piece of India\'s booming IT sector.  The growing US-India 
partnership showed itself to be a factor in the India-Russia 
calculus during this visit, and may have inspired Russia\'s 
nuclear cold shoulder.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Preceding Putin\'s arrival, Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov visited New 
Delhi to preview the visit, leading to speculation that Putin 
and PM Manmohan Singh would sign a number of far-reaching 
agreements.  In the end, deliverables from this annual summit 
were rather modest.  With discussions that ranged from arms 
to pharmaceuticals to visas, the leaders produced a four-page 
Joint Declaration and 10 to 14 MOUs (the exact number is 
unclear).  New Delhi-based Russia-watchers waxed eloquent on 
the depth and historical strength of India-Russia bonds 
\"even\" in light of improving relations with the US, but the 
general tone of the visit was unusually scratchy. 
 
Shoring up the Foundation: Defense 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) As expected, defense issues dominated the talks with 
official statements and media reports highlighting GOI 
concern about reliability of arms sales and support, a strong 
desire by both sides to pursue defense co-production, Russian 
concern about leakage of sensitive technology from India, and 
the increasing role of India\'s growing energy needs in 
shaping its foreign policy.  Some observers noted Russian 
eagerness to conclude long-pending agreements in order to 
frustrate the US from getting a piece of the large Indian 
arms market. 
 
Arms: Upgrades, Supply Guarantees, and Joint Ventures 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
4. (U) Just before Putin\'s arrival, Defense Ministers from 
the two countries signed a \"Protocol of the 
Inter-Governmental Commission for Russian-Indian 
Military-Technical Cooperation\" to expand bilateral military 
cooperation, specifically in upgrading weapons systems and 
various joint production and training initiatives.  India is 
pursuing upgrades of weapons systems and technology as well 
as guaranteed delivery schedules for contracted weapons 
systems, uninterrupted supply of spare parts, life-cycle 
support, and joint production and training ventures. 
According to media reports, the Ministers agreed to upgrade 
equipment including T-72 tanks, but negotiations are still 
underway on upgrading the maritime TU-142 reconnaissance 
aircraft and MiG 29K for the aircraft carrier Admiral 
Gorshkov.  They also agreed to establish service centers to 
repair Russian-made combat hardware. 
 
5. (C) Significantly, Russia offered to make India a partner 
in producing its new fifth generation multi-role fighter and 
has offered India a role in developing a multi-functional 
transport aircraft.  (The US is a potential competitor in 
both of these categories.)  Russia also reportedly committed 
to increasing its 50 percent investment in production of the 
supersonic Brahmos cruise missile to 60 percent, with an 
optimistic proposal to build 360 per year for sale to third 
countries.  Finally, both sides agreed to hold military joint 
exercises in India in 2005, following in the wake of an 
increasingly sophisticated US-India exercise program. 
 
IPR: Co-Production Carrots and Weapons Stoppage Sticks 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (C) Intensified Russia-India defense cooperation remains 
contingent upon the GOI signing a Defense Technology Secrecy 
Agreement (DTSA) (pending for more than two years), under 
which India would agree not to transfer products and 
technology to third parties.  Dangling the carrot of 
co-production, Russian Defense Minister Ivanov said, \"An 
early conclusion of an agreement on intellectual property 
rights would lay the foundation for development of many more 
hi-tech weapons systems jointly by the two countries.\" 
However, before coming to India, Ivanov hinted that defense 
ties could come to a halt if India sought to mix Russian 
technology with proposed purchases from the US (especially 
Patriot), according to Russian press reports quoted in the 
Indian media.  Observer Research Foundation Senior Fellow 
Nandan Unnikrishnan told Poloff he thought the revived 
interest in securing a DTSA originated with new Russian 
Ambassador Vyacheslav Trubnikov, who is \"a man of the 
Kremlin,\" rather than a diplomat.  (He added that the 
Ambassador has \"cut the MFA out,\" noting that the senior 
Russian diplomat responsible for India was not part of the 
Putin delegation.) 
 
7. (C) Indian MOD officials say the GOI agreed to protect 
Russian technology, but also wanted Moscow to sign an MOU to 
provide bank guarantees to ensure future supplies of spares. 
India has been reluctant to sign a DTSA because it is seeking 
a more equitable partnership in joint research and production 
of military hardware, rather than simply importing Russian 
arms.  At the conclusion of the visit, Indian Defense 
Minister Mukherjee said that a non-retroactive DTSA should be 
signed \"in the next five months.\"  A senior MEA official told 
the UK High Commission that India sees this as an Indian 
concession, but one without substantial costs. 
Significantly, the MEA also signaled a general sense of 
dissatisfaction with recent Russian performance as an arms 
supplier. 
 
UNSC Veto Flap Blamed on Translators 
------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C) President Putin defused a flap over a remark he made 
during a press conference on December 3 in which he was 
quoted as saying that an increase in the number of 
veto-holding UNSC members would be \"absolutely unacceptable,\" 
and would erode the effectiveness of the institution (Ref A). 
 After the ensuing media uproar, Putin clarified his 
statement in a December 4 meeting with Indian Vice President 
Shekhawat, attributing the misunderstanding to a translation 
error.  Later on December 4, the MEA released a statement 
that Putin had unambiguously offered Russia\'s support for 
India\'s bid for a permanent UNSC seat, with \"the right of 
veto.\"  Most of our interlocutors saw this as a Russian 
flip-flop in the face of the strong GOI reaction. 
 
Energy: Strike out on Nuclear, Green Light on Oil and Gas 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9. (C) Russia is currently helping India build two 1,000 MW 
nuclear reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, but during the 
visit, the director of Russia\'s Federal Atomic Energy Agency 
gave an interview indicating Moscow would not go against NSG 
rules by providing several additional reactors.  This echoes 
the message that FM Lavrov reportedly delivered during a 
pre-Putin visit (Ref B).  However, it contradicts widespread 
expectations in the Indian nuclear establishment and media 
that Moscow was prepared to provide additional reactors for 
Kudankulam.  The same interview also indicated that Moscow 
had decided to turn down the Indian request for another batch 
of fuel for the US-built Tarapur reactors.  Mission will 
follow-up on these reports, which suggest that Russia may 
have changed its mind on lobbying India to buy more VVER-1000 
reactors.  The ORF\'s Unnikrishnan suggested to us that 
Moscow\'s nuclear cold shoulder may have been a pressure 
tactic, and may not be the end of the story.  He speculated 
that the Russians wanted to send a message that if India 
wants the US to be the \"pole\" of its foreign relations, there 
will be consequences. 
 
10. (C) The two countries did, however, agree to improve 
cooperation in non-nuclear energy, calling for joint 
\"development of new oil and gas fields and the means of their 
transportation in Russia, India, and other countries.\"  This 
agreement also reportedly includes welcoming Indian bids for 
Russian oil giant Yukos.  In one deal, India\'s state-owned 
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Russian Gazprom will 
work together in the Bay of Bengal.  Putin\'s visit also 
produced speculation that India will add to its 20 percent 
stake in Russia\'s Sakhalin One oil field with an investment 
in Sakhalin Three.  In the context of India\'s expanding 
energy needs, the GOI was reportedly surprised at the 
Russians\' private declaration that they control all the gas 
coming out of Turkmenistan. 
 
Eyeing a Piece of the IT Pie 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Putin spent more than half of his India tour in 
Bangalore in an effort to open more economic fronts in the 
India-Russia relationship.  Prior to and throughout the Putin 
visit, Russian officials cited the woefully low level of 
bilateral trade (Ref B).  Traveling with a delegation of 
Russian businesspeople, Putin visited software giant Infosys 
with an eye to gaining from the booming Indian IT sector. 
However, after the stop, an Infosys official remarked that 
his company \"has no plans to expand our operations to 
Russia,\" underlining Bangalore\'s remarkably tight economic 
connection to the US, which leaves little space for 
late-coming Russian firms.  Although Putin also visited 
Bangalore\'s Hindustan Aeronautics, the dominant impression 
one gets from the city is the who\'s who of American IT firms 
that now operate from there. 
 
Blast From the Past 
------------------- 
 
12. (U) Delivering the 2004 Jawarhalal Nehru Memorial Lecture 
in New Delhi, Putin cited uptapped potential of the 
Non-Aligned Movement and decried \"unilateral action in 
international affairs.\"  In a speech notable for its wooden, 
Soviet-style language, Putin commented that \"it is extremely 
dangerous to attempt to rebuild modern 
civilization...according to the barracks principles of a 
unipolar world.\"  He condemned \"dictatorship packaged in a 
pretty wrapping of pseudo-democratic phraseology,\" as 
exacerbating regional conflicts, and added that terrorism, 
with respect to which there are \"double-standards...cannot 
and must not be used in some geo-political games.\"  The 
audience welcomed and saw Putin off with a standing ovation, 
but D/PolCouns noted that listeners applauded only after 
Putin\'s reiteration of support for India\'s UNSC membership. 
 
Beyond India-Russia 
------------------- 
 
13. (C) In addition to public gripes about the US, in his 
private meetings, Putin expressed his irritation with Western 
involvement in the Ukraine crisis, according to the MEA 
readout provided to the UK High Commission (strictly 
protect).  The British added that Putin and the Indians 
commiserated over inconsistent handling of proliferation 
issues, particularly AQ Khan and Iran, and concluded that 
India and Russia have a basically similar approach towards 
Tehran, although neither wants to see Iranian nuclear 
weaponization.  On Iraq, Putin privately expressed his 
concerns about security there and the danger of the country 
splitting along religious and clan-based lines. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (C) Although Putin\'s visit saw many of the old 
India-Russia friendship themes, the two had little success in 
their attempt to move beyond defense cooperation.  Although 
we have still to get a complete GOI readout on this visit, we 
are struck by the generally scratchy atmospherics.  As MEA 
Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar put it to PolCouns, 
\"we have dealt with the Russians a long time,\" and know how 
to handle their pressure (a reference to Ivanov\'s 
heavy-handed message that Russia might consider an arms sales 
relationship with Pakistan).  In courting an IT connection 
with Bangalore, Russia will have to get in line behind the 
US, Europe and Japan, who are all more established and more 
attractive technology partners.  On first examination, this 
visit reconfirmed the impression that India and Russia still 
have not figured out how to adjust their partnership to the 
realities and changing relationships around them.  Emerging 
tension in the India-Russia relationship is a trend we may 
see more of as the New Delhi-Moscow power equation continues 
to shift gradually in India\'s direction, and the GOI seeks 
further to shed the dependency that has characterized their 
relationship for much of India\'s history.

SUBJECT: DIXIT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO INDO-PAK 
RAPPROCHEMENT; CAUTIOUS ON IRAQ 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador David Mulford, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Meeting December 7 with the Ambassador, 
Indian NSA Dixit offered a guardedly optimistic assessment of 
the Indo-Pak peace process, reaffirming the PM\'s commitment 
to \"innovative solutions\" but also cautioning that there will 
be no territorial concessions by India.  \"Short of that,\" he 
added, \"many things are possible.\"  Reflecting the continued 
GOI willingness to climb down from established positions in 
furtherance of normalization, Dixit described a new GOI 
approach to the issue of cross border documentation that he 
hoped would facilitate a bus service between the two sides of 
Kashmir.  Pointing to the recent expert talks on cross border 
train service, Dixit expressed suspicion that the Pakistani 
establishment had decided to put the brakes on Indo-Pak 
people to people exchanges.  Speaking briefly on Iraq, Dixit 
said New Delhi was torn between \"our heart and our head\" -- 
the former argues for assisting the United States at a time 
of difficulty, although intellectually India is cautious of 
involvement while the security situation is so unsettled and 
the domestic Indian politics are difficult.  Dixit looked 
forward to a further discussion of these issues with 
Secretary Rumsfeld.  End Summary. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
Iraq: How to Deliver? 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador opened this December 7 discussion by 
expressing puzzlement that India, despite its large interests 
in the Gulf, has been so reluctant to be involved in the 
construction of Iraqi democracy.  Dixit confided that he has 
been discussing with the Prime Minister how India could be 
more supportive in Iraq.  He recalled that the BJP \"wanted to 
send troops\" and was prevented from doing so by a 
Parliamentary resolution pushed by Congress.  That legacy, 
and the pressure of the left parties, creates \"a major 
political problem\" for any further Indian involvement.  He 
added that the PM was \"still cogitating\" on what India can 
do.  \"The US is important and Iraq is very important,\" Dixit 
added, noting that \"if we don\'t contribute to stabilization, 
Islamic radicalism may go out of control\" in a way that 
threatens India.  Reflecting the GOI dilemma, Dixit related 
that \"the heart says join the Americans to help, but the head 
says to be very careful.\"  He concluded by noting that 
although the PM was unlikely to convey any specific offers of 
assistance, the GOI would look forward to an Iraq discussion 
with Secdef Rumsfeld. 
 
Pakistan: Keeping the Momentum 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Turning to Indo-Pak relations, Dixit queried about 
Musharraf\'s visit to the White House, expressing relief at 
the US intention to remain engaged on the problem of 
cross-border terrorist infiltration.  Stepping back, Dixit 
argued that \"somehow the message has to get to Pakistan that 
Manmohan Singh is inclined to envisage innovative solutions.\" 
 However, he continued, there is \"one basic limitation -- 
jurisdictionally to give up the Valley or other areas in J&K 
is not on.\"  \"Short of that, many things are possible.\"  \"If 
Pakistan signals that it is not insistent on disturbing 
borders or the LOC as it exists,\" the NSA continued, \"then 
its relevance can be eroded by other devices.\"  Getting 
Pakistan to recognize this opportunity is the object of 
Dixit\'s back-channel dialogue with Tariq Aziz.  However, the 
NSA concluded, \"I know it will be a long haul.\" 
 
Indian Concession on Bus Documentation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) As evidence of India\'s resolve to keep pushing the 
Indo-Pak peace process, Dixit cited a new GOI position on 
documentation for travelers using the proposed bus from 
Srinagar to Muzaffarabad on the two sides of the LOC. 
Pakistan has objected to using passports and visas on this 
route (as is done for Kashmiris traveling by air) since that 
could imply recognition of Indian jurisdiction on their side 
of the LOC.  Instead, Dixit recounted, \"India has 
accommodated 60-70%\" of the GOP position by offering to use a 
separate \"certificate\" for crossing the LOC which would be 
stamped by both sides \"without in prejudice to jurisdiction.\" 
 A passport would be used only to establish identity when 
procuring this LOC crossing certificate from the relevant 
High Commission. 
 
5. (C) Dixit lamented that the GOP appeared to have rejected 
this offer, insisting that no form of national identification 
could be used for crossing the LOC.  He expressed strong 
suspicion that \"the Pakistanis don\'t really want contacts to 
happen.\"  As evidence, he cited the Pakistani insistence that 
the proposed rail line between Rajasthan and Sindh would take 
three years to complete, even though there is meter gauge 
rail on both sides of the border that could be ready for use 
in a few months.  Similarly, Dixit complained that Islamabad 
had quashed a proposal to allow free flow of text books and 
educational books, fearing that this could \"erode the 
ideology of Pakistan.\" 
 
6. (C) Despite these frustrations, Dixit underlined that the 
PM is strongly committed to get the bus service started, and 
to launch a parallel route between Sialkot and Jammu.  Dixit 
was also encouraged by the positive meeting between Manmohan 
Singh and Punjab Chief Minister Choudhary Pervez Elahi.  He 
insisted that this kind of people-to-people contact will 
\"make an impact on the broader political environment.\"  He 
recognized the Pakistani fear that too much connectivity will 
detract from a focus on Kashmir, and worried that Islamabad 
would be tempted to claim that India was being obstinate, and 
then walk away from the Composite Dialogue process.  He was 
encouraged by the continued decline in infiltration (which he 
attributed to both Pakistani policy and improved Indian 
counter-insurgency performance), and placed great importance 
on the continuation of the LOC cease-fire.  But, he worried 
that Pakistan still had unrealistic objectives. 
 
Kashmir 
------- 
 
7. (C) Dixit struck a similar note of conditional optimism 
regarding the Kashmir internal track.  He said the PM was 
happy with his visit to Srinagar, but disappointed that the 
Kashmiri Hurriyat parties were unwilling to speak to him.  He 
confided that some in the GOI had opposed authorizing travel 
documents for Hurriyat leaders who planned travel to an early 
December Pugwash (Track II) dialogue in Kathmandu.  However, 
the PM had intervened personally to see that they would be 
allowed to travel with no restrictions on their passports. 
\"We want them to acknowledge the privileges of being a 
citizen of a democratic country,\" Dixit declared, underlining 
New Delhi\'s view that Hurriyat leaders like the Mirawaiz are 
subject to Indian authority.

Classified By: PolCouns Geoffrey Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Speaking informally at a just-concluded 
track-II conference on Nepal, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran 
argued that New Delhi and Kathmandu must work more closely 
together to defeat the Maoists, that Nepalese mistrust of 
India is misplaced, and that economic development could help 
Nepal overcome the insurgency, according to MEA 
Undersecretary (Nepal) Manu Mahawar.  Mahawar predicted that 
King Gyanendra would visit New Delhi, probably during the 
latter part of December, and indicated that the GOI would use 
that opportunity to encourage the King not to curtail Prime 
Minister Deuba\'s authority.  This comes against a growing 
expectation in Indian non-governmental circles that PM 
Deuba\'s days are numbered.  Mahawar noted that 160 Nepalese 
police officers had just completed training in Hyderabad, and 
said another 300 officers would enter the pilot program in 
mid-December under India\'s new police training initiative. 
New Delhi remains concerned about the nexus between 
anti-India insurgent groups and Nepalese Maoists, he 
emphasized.  End Summary. 
 
Shyam Saran \"Speaks From the Heart\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran \"spoke from the heart\" 
on the need to defeat the Maoist insurgency when he 
inaugurated a December 5-6 track-II conference on Nepal, MEA 
Undersecretary (Nepal) Manu Mahawar told Poloff on December 
7.  Mahawar described the Foreign Secretary\'s comments as his 
personal views, but said the remarks were \"completely 
consistent\" with the official GOI line.  He attributed this 
consistency to Saran\'s significant role in the formulation of 
India\'s policy toward Nepal. 
 
3.  (C) According to Mahawar, Saran outlined a four point 
approach to dealing with the Maoists: 
 
-- India and Nepal must coordinate more closely in order to 
resolve the Maoist problem; 
 
-- The Maoists must understand that they cannot win 
militarily and that the longer they avoid negotiations, the 
weaker their bargaining power will become.  This requires 
sustained military pressure on the Maoists, and concrete 
military successes by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA); 
 
-- The Palace and the political parties must put aside their 
differences, and present a united front to the Maoists; 
 
-- Development is one means of overcoming the Maoist threat. 
Kathmandu should \"hitch itself\" to India\'s economy in order 
to promote economic growth. 
 
According to Indian media reports, Saran also argued that 
Nepalese mistrust of India is misplaced and that Nepal should 
view India as an ally in the fight against the Maoists.  A 
December 6 \"Hindustan Times\" article reported that Saran 
urged the inclusion of \"progressive\" Maoists into the 
mainstream. 
 
4.  (C) Conference participants included journalists and 
academics from India, as well as representatives from major 
Nepalese political parties, including the UML and Nepali 
Congress Party.  \"Foreign participants\" were not allowed to 
attend. 
 
King Still Expected in New Delhi 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Although the dates have yet to be finalized, the MEA 
still expects a visit of King Gyanendra to New Delhi, 
probably sometime in the latter half of December.  Mahawar 
speculated that the GOI would emphasize the need for unity 
between the Palace and the political parties, further 
encourage the King not to undermine the Prime Minister, and 
highlight the need for Nepalese security forces to be more 
effective against the Maoists.  It would be \"regressive\" if 
the King weakened PM Deuba\'s authority, he observed, arguing 
that a change in PM would only exacerbate the situation. 
 
6.  (C) The King\'s expected visit comes against a growing 
feeling in New Delhi-based non-governmental circles that PM 
Deuba\'s days are numbered.  According to Jawaharlal Nehru 
University Professor SD Muni, Deuba\'s removal is 
\"inevitable.\"  He predicted that Deuba would not be removed 
from office until after the January 13th deadline for the 
Maoists to come to the negotiating table, and speculated that 
Deuba set the deadline to buy himself time.  The MEA\'s 
Mahawar also noted a high degree of skepticism surrounding 
the King\'s intentions toward Deuba by participants in the 
track-II conference. 
 
Police Training In Progress 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Offering an update on Nepal\'s police training project 
in Hyderabad (reftel), Mahawar reported that the first batch 
of 160 officers had graduated from the program on December 2, 
after ten weeks of training.  The second batch of 300 
officers is scheduled to begin training the third week of 
December, he said.  Once the second batch graduates, the GOI 
will evaluate the program before deciding whether to continue 
the project, now in its pilot phase. 
 
Working Together to Strengthen the Border 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Echoing more senior Indian officials, Mahawar 
expressed concern about the recent creation of the Communist 
Party of India (Maoist) -- formed from the merger anti-India 
People\'s War Group and Maoist Communist Centre -- alleging 
that Nepalese Maoists had facilitated the merger.  He 
underlined GOI concerns over organizations such as the 
Coordinating Committee of Maoists Partners and Organizations 
in South Asia (CCOMPOSA), that promote links between 
insurgent factions, and claimed that nearly one-fourth of the 
country is affected by such groups.  Seventy-five districts 
are \"severely affected,\" he stated, adding that both India 
and Nepal were deploying troops to \"sensitive areas\" along 
the border in an effort to strengthen security there.

1. (C) Following up discussion at the recent US-India 
Strategic Stability Dialogue (reftel), the GOI has conveyed a 
December 8 letter (full text para 2) from Foreign Secretary 
Saran to Undersecretary Grossman formally requesting a 
classified briefing on the Patriot PAC-2 missile system.  The 
decision to move ahead on this initiative was clearly timed 
with a view to the impending visit of SECDEF Rumsfeld. 
However, it also reflects a prolonged debate within the 
Congress government over missile defense policy, and the GOI 
conclusion that deeper US-India collaboration in this area 
would help to strengthen our new partnership and would

Dear Mr. Undersecretary, 
 
I refer to your letter dated October 1, 2004 offering India 
the opportunity to purchase Patriot Advanced Capability-2 
(PAC-2) missile defense capability as part of the reciprocal 
steps contemplated in Phase 1 of the Next Steps in Strategic 
Partnership. 
 
In order to evaluate the proposal, concerned Indian experts 
would be interested in receiving a classified briefing on the

RAIL LINK MOVING SLOWLY

1.  (C) Summary: The December 7-8 talks in New Delhi on 
beginning a bus service between the two parts of Kashmir made 
no progress after the governments failed to break the impasse 
over documentation and modalities for crossing the LOC.  Each 
side offered what they termed compromise solutions, but none 
were mutually acceptable.  Demonstrating continued 
political-level commitment to Indo-Pak rapprochement, the GOI 
embraced a proposal for LOC-crossing certificates that first 
surfaced in the Track-II \"Neemrana\" dialogue.  Commenting 
that India favored opening the road largely for economic 
reasons, a member of the GOI delegation told D/Polcouns that 
it became evident during the meeting that Islamabad would not 
agree to any mechanism that could allow the LOC to become a 
de facto border.  The December 2-3 meeting on the proposed 
Munnabao-Khokhrapar train connection was only slightly more 
successful, in that both sides agreed to open links, but not 
on a timeframe to do so.  New Delhi complains that Islamabad 
is demanding unnecessary infrastructure changes that will 
drag out the rail link for at least three years, and cites 
this as evidence of GOP opposition to people-to-people links. 
 Five working-level sessions remain before the two Foreign 
Secretaries meet in Islamabad on December 27-28 to review 
 
SIPDIS 
Round 2 of Composite Dialogue talks.  End Summary. 
 
Deadlocked by Document Dispute 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Despite recent public comments by NSA Dixit and 
Foreign Ministers Natwar Singh and Kasuri that the proposed 
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service would start \"soon,\" 
observers in New Delhi were not surprised when the December 
7-8 talks in New Delhi on the technical aspects of such a 
service failed to yield results over documents required for 
crossing the LOC (reftel).  The GOI dropped its past 
insistence for visas, suggesting instead a separate entry 
certificate issued by the respective High Commissions, but 
wanted passports as a form of identification for issuance of 
this document.  New Delhi also conceded that the entry 
permit, and not the passport, would be stamped at crossing, 
and also offered that the permits could be issued at stations 
set up in J&K to remove the hardship of Kashmiris having to 
journey to New Delhi for documentation.  The Pakistanis 
responded that the use of passports for identification was 
inconsistent with their characterization of Kashmir as a 
\"disputed territory\" and insisted (according to the Indian 
government) that this service be available only to 
\"Kashmiris\" (without elaborating how to define this 
population).  No date was set for resumption of talks on this 
issue although we expect it to be addressed in the next 
session of the Dixit-Aziz \"back-channel.\" 
 
3.  (C) J&K Resident Commissioner Parvez Dewan (protect) told 
D/Polcouns on December 8 that the meeting was cordial and 
friendly, but observed that Pakistan had made no comparable 
compromises.  The sides met for about two hours on December 
7, and for only a few minutes on December 8, on the grounds 
that it made no sense to resume talks given the impasse.  He 
said Islamabad had refused to accept the use of any passports 
at all, because that would endow the LOC with the legal 
status of a border, which Pakistan adamantly opposes. 
Commenting that India was eager to open the road for economic 
reasons, Dewan called Pakistani proposals to use UN documents 
as in the case of Cyprus and Red Cross certificates as in the 
case of Korea \"unacceptable.\"  The Pakistani High Commission 
confirmed to us that the GOI turned down these two models -- 
as well as a restoration of the pre-1953 \"Rahdari\" system by 
which travelers used documents issued by local officials on 
both sides of the LOC -- as \"not applicable in the context of 
J&K.\"  All-Parties Hurriyat Conference leader Mirwaiz Umar 
Farooq told us December 8 that he was partial to the Rahdari 
system. 
4.  (C) Indian media were quick to claim that the GOP came to 
New Delhi intending to keep the discussion \"political\" as 
opposed to \"technical.\"  Journalists noted that three of the 
four members of the Pakistani delegation were from the 
Foreign Ministry, while their nine Indian interlocutors were 
led by a Joint Secretary in the Transport Ministry and 
included members from the Foreign and Home Ministries and the 
J&K government, which suggested the GOI was prepared to 
address specific details. 
 
Who Travels on Which Transport Company 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Discussion further bogged down over who would be 
permitted to travel on the bus.  New Delhi sought to treat 
the service as any other public conveyance and allow all 
Indian citizens access, which would reinforce its position on 
passports as identity documents.  Islamabad, in contrast, 
wanted the bus to carry only residents of Kashmir.  The 
prospect of non-Kashmiris crossing the LOC raised the 
likelihood that passports, and not documents issued in 
Kashmir, would be required.  Dewan added that Islamabad 
called for a national bus company to be the carrier, because 
it did not wish the J&K Road Transport Company to travel 
between the two sides, commenting that this was impossible, 
because all of India\'s bus companies are state level.  This 
was only one of the \"red herrings\" the Pakistani delegation 
introduced into the talks, he stated.  (The current 
Delhi-Lahore bus is operated by the respective state 
transport companies.) 
 
Infrastructure Problems Also Remain 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Analysts pointed out that even if an agreement on the 
political and technical aspects of the bus service were 
hammered out, it would take months to refurbish the currently 
unused road that transits the LOC.  Laborers are reportedly 
working overtime to complete repairs to the Indian side of 
the road, which even military vehicles cannot currently 
traverse.  Meanwhile, the bridge that actually crosses the 
LOC faces at least four months of repair work, and its 
location straddling the LOC will undoubtedly complicate the 
process, according to J&K-based journalists. 
 
Other Roads Won\'t Open 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The lack of agreement over travel documents continues 
the impasse over what could become a network of cross-LOC 
transport connections.  In recent weeks the GOI has proposed 
buses running Kargil-Skardu, Poonch-Mirpur, and Jammu-Sialkot 
routes, but the deadlock over documents will hamstring 
progress on all these CBMs. 
 
Side Proposal for Kashmiris Floated 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Separately, \"Asian Age\" reported on December 7 that 
the GOI had put forward an idea for designated points along 
the LOC where divided Kashmiri families could meet on a 
regular schedule.  This would be a marked improvement over 
the current practice of families arriving at their respective 
sides of the LOC and calling to each other from across a 
river or check-point. 
 
Proposed Train Link Gathering a Little Steam 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) The December 2-3 talks in Islamabad on the proposed 
Munnabao-Khokhrapar rail link connecting Rajasthan and Sindh 
were more successful, with the delegations announcing on 
December 3 that they had agreed to an \"early resumption of 
the rail link\" and to replace and refurbish the rail 
infrastructure.  The agreement remained hampered, however, by 
Islamabad\'s estimate of \"two to three years\" to lay new gauge 
track to accommodate such rail service.  This represented a 
significant delay over Natwar Singh\'s recent pronouncement 
that this southern Indo-Pak land crossing could commence 
business by October 2005 -- which the GOI says would be 
possible if the two sides stuck to the current meter gauge 
system. 
 
Remaining Composite Dialogue Discussions 
---------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) The below schedule for the remaining meetings in 
Round 2 of the Composite Dialogue reflects the rescheduling 
of the anti-narcotics and Foreign Secretaries meetings: 
 
December 9-10 (New Delhi): Meeting of the Committee of 
Experts regarding trade issues. 
 
December 13-14 (New Delhi): Meetings between narcotics 
control authorities. 
 
December 14-15 (Karachi): Joint survey of the boundary 
pillars in the horizontal section of the Sir Creek area. 
 
December 14-15 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on nuclear 
CBMs, including discussion on a draft agreement for prior 
notification of missile tests. 
 
December 15-16 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on 
conventional CBMs. 
 
December 27-28 (Islamabad): Foreign Secretaries meeting to 
review issues discussed this month and to set a schedule for 
another round of talks, possibly to begin in February 2005. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) As NSA Dixit confirmed to the Ambassador on December 
7 (reftel), PM Manmohan Singh remains personally committed to 
opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, but it will not 
become a reality until both sides climb down further from 
their positions.  This will require engagement at the 
political level on both sides, although there are voices in 
the GOI that are calling for India now to call Pakistan\'s 
bluff and agree to its demands.  The MEA, in particular, is 
concerned that Islamabad opposes new connections between the 
two sides of Kashmir because this would tend to deflate the 
jihadist movement.  The issue of bus and rail service may 
arise again at the December 27-28 Foreign Secretaries talks 
in Islamabad or in the Dixit-Aziz back-channel, but the 
enduring deadlock over documents for cross-LOC travel is 
inextricably linked to each nation\'s views on Kashmir, and 
compromise will be difficult.  This will delay further the 
large number of Kashmiris who wish to travel across the LOC 
for family, tourism, and economic reasons. 
 
12.  (C) As the Composite Dialogue continues, it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that Pakistan 
is holding concrete progress on important CBMs hostage to 
Indian concessions on Kashmir.  Atmospherics in India remain 
remarkably positive, but the intrinsically zero-sum nature of 
Kashmir is preventing the CD from living up to its potential 
to build new constituencies for peace and reduce the risk of 
renewed crisis.

1.  (C) Summary: Israeli Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\'s 
December 5-10 visit to India was \"extremely positive\" and 
provided an opportunity to expand the bilateral relationship 
beyond defense, Israel Embassy DCM Yoed Magen told A/PolCouns 
and Poloff on December 16.  The visit, the first high-level 
exchange between India and Israel since the UPA government 
assumed power in May, was a welcome improvement over the poor 
foreign office consultations that took place in November. 
Even FM Natwar Singh emphasized the importance of ties with 
Jerusalem, a reflection of the growing consensus within the 
GOI about the utility of good relations with Israel.  Magen 
said the successful Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group, 
held just prior to Olmert\'s visit, highlighted the countries\' 
mutual concerns and helped recover the momentum lost after 
the foreign office consultations.  Israel raised its concerns 
about Iran, prompting NSA Dixit to acknowledge that India 
faces a \"real dilemma,\" given New Delhi\'s good relations with 
Iran and Tehran\'s nuclear ambitions.  If the November 
India-Israel foreign office consultations demonstrated the 
sometimes opposing views at work within the GOI on relations 
with Israel, the Vice PM\'s visit illustrated solid support 
for them at the Ministerial level.  End Summary. 
 
Many Ministers But No PM 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Offering a readout of the first high-level exchange 
between India and Israel since the UPA government assumed 
power, Israel Embassy DCM Yoed Magen (protect throughout) 
told A/PolCouns and Poloff that the December 5-10 visit of 
Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was a significant improvement 
over the \"uncomfortable\" foreign office consultations held in 
November (Ref A).  Signaling New Delhi\'s intent to strengthen 
ties with Israel, Olmert received meetings with seven 
ministers, including FM Natwar Singh, Finance Minister 
Chidambaram, and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath, as well as 
the Ministers of Agriculture, Science and Technology, and the 
Ministers of State for Communications and Information 
Technology, and the Prime Minister\'s Office. 
 
3.  (C) PM Manmohan Singh declined to meet with the 
delegation, despite former PM Vajpayee\'s meeting with Deputy 
PM Silvan Shalom (of lower rank than Olmert) in February (Ref 
B).  Magen opined that a meeting with the PM would have 
publicly signaled a \"close degree of intimacy\" with Israel, 
something the GOI may prefer to keep private.  Reflecting the 
economic focus of the visit, representatives from over 50 
Israeli companies also participated in the trip and traveled 
to Bangalore, Mumbai, and New Delhi, and held hundreds of 
meetings with Indian business people. 
 
Natwar\'s Friendly Gesture 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) According to Magen, Olmert had an \"excellent\" 
discussion with FM Natwar Singh, a stark contrast to the 
\"disappointing\" foreign office consultations held at the 
Secretary level in November.  He speculated that the meeting 
 
SIPDIS 
was the first time Natwar had ever been exposed to Israeli 
policy directly from a senior Israeli official, calling the 
conversation an \"extremely important step in building 
confidence between the two countries.\"  He said that Natwar 
and Olmert \"had good chemistry\" during the meetings, and the 
FM unexpectedly appeared at a dinner in honor of the Israeli 
delegation, \"as a friendly gesture and to reassure Israel of 
the importance India attaches to relations.\"  Natwar 
emphasized that Israel was important to him, \"despite what 
people say,\" Magen stated, adding that he heard Natwar had 
excused himself from a cabinet meeting in order to attend the 
dinner.  Commenting on the evolution of Natwar\'s thinking, 
Magen noted that the FM did not mention the Non-Aligned 
Movement once during his November 6 speech at a \"Hindustan 
Times\" conference or in his recent remarks before Parliament. 
 
5.  (C) As an emerging global power, India does not want to 
be absent from developments in the Middle East, Magen 
observed, noting that New Delhi has been demonstrating a 
greater interest in the region.  In 1991 when the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace process began, India had no role 
because New Delhi did not have diplomatic relations with 
Jerusalem.  The GOI, including NSA Dixit and PM Manmohan 
Singh, now recognize the \"ground reality\" there, he argued, 
adding that either Defense Minister Mukherjee or FM Natwar 
Singh would likely visit Israel in the coming months. 
 
Counter Terrorism: \"On Safe Ground\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Offering a readout of the December 1 India-Israel 
Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group (CTJWG), Magen told us 
the event \"helped bring the relationship back on course.\" 
Led by Israeli Deputy Director for Strategic Affairs Jeremy 
Issacharoff, the CTJWG underlined the two countries similar 
concerns and approach to terrorism and terrorist financing. 
The Israelis felt so comfortable discussing counter terrorism 
with India that \"we felt that we were on safe ground,\" he 
remarked. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
7.  (C) Issacharoff raised Israeli concerns about Iran \"very 
sharply\" with New Delhi during the CTJWG, Magen remarked, 
adding that Olmert\'s delegation also flagged nuclear-related 
concerns and Iran\'s negative role in the Middle East peace 
process.  The Israelis argued that Iran\'s influence in the 
occupied territories deters progress, stressing that 
\"whatever happens in the Middle East will affect India.\"  NSA 
Dixit reportedly told Issacharoff that India faces a \"real 
dilemma\" because \"we have good relations with Iran, but the 
nuclear issue is a problem.\"  Magen said Dixit had said that 
he was blunt during his mid-October visit to Tehran, telling 
the Iranians to honor their international commitments (to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty) or \"pay the consequences.\" 
 
Beyond Defense 
-------------- 
 
8.  (C) Magen noted that a major objective of Olmert\'s visit 
had been to diversify relations beyond defense, to include 
cooperation in economic, hi-tech, biotechnology, and 
agricultural areas.  The two countries agreed to establish a 
joint study group to formulate a comprehensive economic 
partnership, and signed an agreement with the Ministry of 
Finance that would set up a mechanism to guarantee Israeli 
investments (comparable to the USG\'s OPIC).  He commented 
that Israel had raised the issue last year, but the GOI had 
not been interested.  Finance Minister P Chidambaram approved 
the agreement during the visit, a move that surprised Magen. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) If the November India-Israel foreign office 
consultations demonstrated the sometimes opposing views at 
work within the GOI on relations with Israel, the Vice Prime 
Minister\'s visit illustrated solid support for them at the 
Ministerial level.  While India may not want to publicize its 
ties with Jerusalem (evidenced by the PM\'s refusal to meet 
with the delegation), neither does it want to slow the pace 
of bilateral engagement.  India will likely continue to 
enhance its ties to Israel, while maintaining a low public 
profile.

1.  Summary:  This is another of our periodic messages 
summarizing public statements by MEA Spokesman Navtej Sarna

Minister Badawi\'s and Slovak President Gasparovic\'s visits 
to India, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh\'s trip to South 
Korea and the December 21 meeting of the Parliamentary 
Consultative Committee on External Affairs.  End Summary 
 
Premier Badawi visits India 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  From December 20-25 Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah 
Badawi visited India.  The trip resulted in business 
agreements on IT, biotechnology and satellite systems.  On 
December 21, the GOI announced a deal between the Indian 
Space Research Organization\'s (ISRO) Antrix Corporation and 
MEASAT Global to form a joint venture.  The two companies 
plan to pool their capacity to create a \"satellite 
neighborhood.\"  PM Badawi also traveled to Bangalore, which 
included a stop at Hindustan Aeronautics, Ltd. (HAL).  The 
MEA emphasized Malaysia\'s ASEAN membership, noting that the 
country is India\'s largest trading partner in the 
association. 
 
Slovak President Visits India 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  President Ivan Gasparovic paid a five-day visit to India 
from December 11, during which the two countries signed an 
Economic Cooperation Agreement.  While not explicitly 
indicating Slovakian support for India\'s objective of 
obtaining a permanent seat on the UNSC, the MEA announced 
that Gasparovic was \"of the view that India\'s permanent 
presence.in an expanded UN Security Council would give it 
greater legitimacy and enhance its effectiveness.\" 
 
Neighborhood Review 
------------------- 
 
4.  On December 21 FM Singh met the Parliament\'s External 
Affairs Consultative Committee to review India\'s relations 
with the SAARC member countries and Burma.  According to MEA 
Spokesman Sarna, the discussion also addressed New Delhi\'s 
plan for the January 2005 SAARC Summit in Dhaka. 
 
--Nepal: there is a need to improve infrastructure along the 
border, including an integrated system of checkposts, the 
Maoists are a \"shared security concern,\" and discussions are 
ongoing for extradition and mutual legal assistance 
treaties. 
 
--Bhutan: the Chukha and Kurichu power projects and the 1020 
MW Tala Hydron project should be completed shortly, and the 
Bhutanese King will be the Chief Guest for Republic Day on 
January 26, 2005. 
 
--Bangladesh: the GOI would like the BDG to address New 
Delhi\'s security concerns, and increasingly, Indian 
businesses are interested in investing in Bangladesh. 
 
--Burma: the country has \"direct bearing\" on security and 
development in India\'s Northeast, and the GOI will pursue 
\"constructive engagement\" with Rangoon.  Burma is an 
important link between India and ASEAN. 
 
--Sri Lanka: the economic relationship is a \"model\" among 
India\'s neighbors and Colombo supports India for a permanent 
UNSC seat. 
 
--Pakistan: the atmosphere has improved and New Delhi will 
follow a \"conscious people-centric\" policy which will lead 
to an improved understanding of India\'s position. 
 
FM Singh in Seoul 
----------------- 
 
5. December 13-16 FM Singh traveled to Korea to discuss the 
bilateral security dialogue, which will begin in January 
2005, and to finalize an MOU on defense cooperation. 
According to the MEA, Korean officials \"commended the Indian 
initiative on the vision of an Asian Economic Community.\" 
 
6.  The MEA\'s Sarna noted that media reports suggesting that 
while in Seoul the Foreign Minister had called India\'s 1998 
nuclear test \"regrettable,\" were a distortion of the facts. 
The Spokesman emphasized that FM Singh had said that the 
1998 test was the previous government\'s decision and that 
although India is not a party to the NPT, which is 
discriminatory, those countries that are should honor their 
commitments.

1.  (C) Summary:  MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. 
Jaishankar reiterated GOI desire to assist in Iraq\'s 
elections, but expressed uncertainty about India\'s role in 
light of their own political constraints in a meeting with 
PolCouns and Pol-MilOff on December 29.  Regarding the 
proposed role of the International Mission for Iraq Elections 
(IMIE), he was uncertain that was the niche India should fill 
and was concerned that some of the other states involved in 
the IMIE (especially Canada) did not share India\'s 
sympathetic view of US efforts in Iraq.  He promised to raise 
the issue with Foreign Secretary Saran upon Saran\'s return 
from Pakistan.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Jaishankar (who has played a leading role on Iraqi 
elections as part of his Americas portfolio) indicated that 
India was concerned about tying its role in Iraq to that of 
other governments.  In this context, he noted considerable 
skepticism about the January elections during New Delhi\'s 
consultations in Ottawa recently, commenting that India found 
itself in the ironic role of \"defending the US position\" to 
Ottawa. 
 
3.  (C) He went on to reiterate the GOI\'s strong desire to 
play a useful role in the elections in a manner that their 
domestic constituency would support in the aftermath of the 
kidnapping of three Indian truck drivers in Iraq in the 
summer.  He also expressed frustration that there has been no 
UN response to India\'s previous proposals for assisting in 
the elections, lamenting that \"our proposals are being sat on 
in New York.\" 
 
4.  (C) Regarding PolCouns\' description of the role of the 
IMIE to observe the polling process from Jordan (reftel), 
however, Jaishankar was doubtful that India would 
participate, saying, \"We\'re not sure that is the niche we 
should be filling.\"  \"We\'re looking for middle ground between 
what is acceptable here and what is realistic and useful 
there,\" he added.   He promised to raise the issue with FS 
Saran upon Saran\'s return from travel, and reiterated India\'s 
intention to re-engage in Iraq.

1.  (U) In what was billed by the MEA as an important policy 
speech, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran set forth India\'s 
\"preliminary\" views of the High Level Panel Report on UN 
Reform in a December 30 address.  Prior to Saran\'s speech, 
MEA Joint Secretary (UN Political) BS Prakash advised us to 
pay close attention to the remarks as they would offer the 
\"authoritative\" GOI view on the Panel Report.  During his 
speech to prominent members of the New Delhi foreign policy 
community, including former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey, 
MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar, and High-Level Panel 
member General Satish Nambiar, Saran emphasized: 
 
-- The UN must realign its priorities with those of the 
developing world if it is to retain its relevance.  It should 
safeguard the interests of developing countries instead of 
taking punitive actions against them. 
 
-- The international order is not democratic enough because 
it does not adequately reflect the views of developing 
countries, which constitute most of the world\'s population. 
 
-- Multilateralism is the mechanism through which democracies 
can function.  Citing the recent tsunami as an example, he 
said that today\'s collective challenges require a collective 
response. 
 
-- The UN needs its own budget so that it can act 
independently.  Most UN activities are funded by donors, 
rather than from the UN budget, giving donor countries a 
disproportionate influence over UN priorities. 
 
-- The Panel Report did not focus enough on disarmament.  The 
Chemical Weapons Convention could be used as a model to 
eliminate nuclear weapons. 
 
-- The UN is not the only vehicle to deal with issues of 
international security.  The international community can also 
use bilateral and regional mechanisms (where appropriate) to 
resolve problems. 
 
-- The international community should deal with crises in a 
democratic way, \"without intervention.\" 
 
-- Criticizing \"political expediency,\" Saran said the current 
international system is too focused on punishing the 
recipients of nuclear proliferation and not focused enough on 
the sources of proliferation. 
 
2.  (U) Saran downplayed the issue of Security Council 
expansion, never once even mentioning the word \"veto.\"  He 
reiterated previous GOI comments that India views Security 
Council expansion as only one part of broader UN reform. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
3.  (C) Saran\'s reticence on the mechanics of Security 
Council expansion, along with conflicting signals from other 
GOI officials on the subject (reftel), suggest a continued 
lack of consensus in New Delhi on whether India would be 
prepared to accept a Security Council seat without a veto. 
The internal GOI line is highly pragmatic, but Indian public 
opinion is unprepared to accept what many would see as 
second-class status.  Saran\'s emphasis on the need to deal 
with the sources of nuclear proliferation, echoes comments in 
our recent non-proliferation dialogue and reflects the GOI 
view that the international community has not satisfactorily 
dealt with A Q Khan or Islamabad\'s alleged support for the 
network.

1.  (C) Summary: Foreign Minister Natwar Singh publicly 
acknowledged during a December 22 Parliamentary debate with 
former FM Yashwant Sinha that India had agreed to 
non-diversion and end-use verification of US high technology 
imports, even when they come from a third country.  This is a 
clear sign that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) 
government is serious about the India/US strategic 
partnership and the export control understandings attached to 
the Next Steps in the Strategic Partnership (NSSP).  The 
exchange received almost no press coverage in India, 
illustrating that interest in the NSSP process is largely 
confined to Indian elites.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) On December 22, in the waning days of the Winter 
Session of Parliament, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh made a 
lengthy statement on India\'s foreign policy.  Singh noted 
that Indo/US relations \"have expanded across the board,\" and 
in this context observed that \"It was the UPA Government 
which concluded the long pending first phase of the NSSP.\" 
He detailed that \"the agreement makes US Licensing Policy and 
procedures both transparent and predictable.  End-use 
verification is a consultative process to be undertaken by 
mutual consent.  This is an agreement between equals.  It is 
reflective of the strategic partnership that the two 
countries wish to promote.  It is the first in a series of 
steps to build mutual confidence and trust, leading to 
progressively higher levels of interaction in high technology 
areas.\"  Former Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha jumped on 
this exchange regarding the NSSP to press the issue of third 
countries, leading FM Singh to acknowledge publicly for the 
first time that India was committed to end-use verification 
for American high technology items, whether imported directly 
from the US or from other countries. 
 
3.  (U) Sinha noted to FM Singh that, \"I had raised a very 
specific issue about NSSP when I talked about end-use 
verification.  I am giving him an opportunity to contradict 
me that US origin items of dual use coming from third 
countries will not be subjected to end-use verification as US 
origin items coming directly from the US will.  This is not 
part of the agreement which had been reached in December, 
2003.  There was no agreement with regard to end-use 
verification.\" 
 
4.  (U) The Foreign Minister replied that, \"Under the NSSP, 
the US-origin items, whether directly supplied to us from the 
US or from any other source, will always be the basis of 
negotiations.  It would not have been tenable to exclude 
US-origin goods or technology merely because they were 
obtained from non-US sources.  We ourselves would not accept 
such a distinction with respect to Indian-made technology or 
sensitive goods such as our software.\" 
 
5.  (C) MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar flagged 
this exchange in his meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff on 
December 30.  Jaishankar noted that FM Singh\'s line on 
end-use verification of US origin items imported from third 
countries was essentially the same as the policy of the 
previous NDA government, e.g., protection of US dual-use 
items is an extension of protection that the GOI seeks for 
Indian produced dual-use items.  This argument, however, 
seemed to \"thoroughly confound\" Sinha and effectively ended 
further discussion of the matter.  Jaishankar went on to 
recall that during his visit to the US in November, Commerce 
U/S Juster had inquired what the GOI response would be should 
this issue of non-diversion for goods from third countries 
become a matter of public debate.  Noting that his is the 
first time this issue has been raised in a public forum, 
Jaishankar reiterated that the GOI stands by its private 
commitment to respect end-use restrictions even for US origin 
dual-use items from third countries.  \"Our treatment of US 
items is the same as our treatment of Indian items,\" he 
concluded. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) FM Singh\'s statement was the first time that the GOI 
publicly revealed the concessions it had made regarding 
end-use verification under the NSSP, and indicates that the 
UPA government is serious in upholding its NSSP obligations 
and pushing the India/US relationship to a new level.  It 
came as no surprise that former FM Sinha, who was privy to 
earlier rounds of NSSP negotiations, sought to use the 
non-diversion agreement to charge the UPA government with 
caving in to US demands.  Singh\'s statement received almost 
no press coverage in India, as public interest in the NSSP is 
largely confined to Indian elites and technical specialists, 
many of whom are still trying to understand the commitments 
attached to the NSSP.

1.  (U) Reflecting the very positive Indian reaction to the 
US initiative to create a Core Group for tsunami relief, and 
New Delhi\'s resolve to do even more to assist India\'s 
neighbors, on December 30 the MEA provided us with a further 
update on GOI support for Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and 
Indonesia. 
 
2.  (U) Sri Lanka 
 
--The GOI has already supplied 35 tons of dry provisions, 
relief and medical supplies along with communications 
equipment, and several medical teams, including specialists, 
who have been attending to patients.  Indian aircraft have 
provided airlift capability to people and supplies, while 
crews have offered salvage support in clearing harbors, 
divers, and search and rescue sorties. 
 
--Four Indian Navy vessels and seven helicopters had reached 
Sri Lanka by December 29.  The helicopters included three 
Mi-8 and four shipborne Chetaks. 
 
--Two aircraft, one Dornier and one Islander, began operating 
from Colombo on December 30. 
 
--On December 30, the GOI airlifted 700 kilograms more of 
medical supplies. 
 
--The INS Sandhayak (reftel), after delivering its supplies, 
will be converted into a hospital ship. 
 
--Three more Indian Navy vessels, the LCU 33, the INS 
Ghorpad, and the INS Kirch, are enroute to Sri Lanka with 
additional supplies of fuel, rice and water.  They are 
expected to arrive in Trincomalee between December 30 and 
January 1. 
 
--Two IL 76 aircraft carrying military field hospitals are 
scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on December 30. 
 
3.  (U) Maldives 
 
--Three Avros and one Dornier aircraft delivered six tons of 
supplies to the Maldives and are now in Male (reftel).  The 
Indian High Commissioner in Male has indicated that other 
than specific items such as water canisters, there is no need 
for further supplies. 
 
--The INS Mysore (destroyer) and the INS Udaygiri (frigate) 
are in Male.  The ships have been used for transporting 
people and supplies to outlying islands, damage assessment, 
and search and rescue. 
 
--The Indian Navy tanker, the INS Aditya, which is equipped 
with drinking water and a water purification plant, arrived 
in the Maldives on December 30.  The INS Aditya also has a 
helicopter. 
 
--The four helicopters from the three ships have flown seven 
sorties. 
 
4.  (U) Indonesia 
 
--A survey ship, the INS Nirupak, is scheduled to leave 
shortly for Aceh with relief supplies, medicine and tents. 
Cruising time to Aceh is about 100 hours. 
 
5.  (C) In a late December 29 conversation with PolCouns, MEA 
Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar said that India 
fully supports and welcomes the formation of the Core Group 
for tsunami relief, but reiterated that assistance is not 
needed within India.  He noted that the GOI has briefed the 
other Core Group members on aid New Delhi has already 
provided, adding that India would like to do more, but needs 
information on specific needs.  Jaishankar asked that when 
moving US forces into the Indian region, that PACOM recognize 
that the Indian military is stretched thin, limiting the GOI 
ability to provide operational support to others.  He said 
the GOI\'s foreign relief effort will be run out of the 
Ministry of External Affairs, and emphasized India\'s 
commitment to work closely with the US.

1. (C) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign 
Secretary Saran expressed satisfaction at the US-India 
 
SIPDIS 
partnership in responding to the December 26 Bay of Bengal 
tsunami, and offered his understanding that the core group -- 
 
SIPDIS 
having effectively triggered a robust response from the UN 
and others in the international community -- would now move 
into a different phase with fewer daily teleconferences. 
 
2. (C) Providing some context for his January 1 phone call to 
Undersecretary Grossman, Saran explained that India was 
surprised by press reports of comments attributed to the US 
Ambassador in Colombo referring to the imminent arrival in 
Sri Lanka of a very large US Marine contingent.  He raised 
this at the political level only because it was not 
consistent with information shared in core group channels. 
\"We are not saying this is our backyard so you need to stay 
out,\" Saran elaborated.  However, given the large number of 
Indian forces already in Sri Lanka (which he put at 1,200, 
plus multiple ships and aircraft), it is important for New 
Delhi to be aware of US military planning.  In this context, 
Saran welcomed the US military briefing that DAO provided 
earlier that day to the Indian armed forces. 
 
3. (C) Contrary to reports appearing in the Sri Lankan press 
(now repeated in Indian media) Saran did not convey any sense 
of unease about the US military presence in India\'s 
neighborhood.  To the contrary, he expressed great 
appreciation for India\'s involvement in the tsunami core 
group and the recognition that implied of the GOI\'s 
contribution to reconstruction and recovery in Sri Lanka and 
the Maldives.  He added that the daily teleconference was \"an 
extremely useful exercise.\"  He was gracious in acknowledging 
the United States\' early statement of sympathy and support 
for the Indian victims of the tsunami. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador flagged the US military interest in 
developing further channels of US-India information sharing 
in the Bay of Bengal region.  Saran agreed this would be 
useful, noted that Indian Ambassadors in the region have been 
instructed to reach out to US counterparts, and indicated 
that the Indian defense attache in Bangkok had been tasked to 
\"look into coordination with the USJTF\" at Utapao.  With 
USAID efforts now turning to the question of long term 
reconstruction, the Ambassador suggested that this too would 
be a mutually beneficial area of US-India information 
sharing.  Saran did not respond specifically, but did note 
the GOI expectation that the UN will play an increasingly 
prominent role as the focus turns from Tsunami relief to 
long-term reconstruction in the Bay of Bengal region. 
 
5. (C) Septel covers Saran\'s concerns regarding the potential 
for upcoming Codel visits to disrupt ongoing relief efforts 
in tsunami-affected regions of southern India.

1. (C) Indian readouts track closely with Islamabad\'s 
detailed and generally positive assessment of the December 
27-28 meeting of Foreign Secretaries that concluded the 
second round of the Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue (reftel).  In 
a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary 
Saran remarked on the \"excellent atmosphere\" of the December 
meeting, adding that the Islamabad talks were \"absolutely 
free of acrimony\" and \"very friendly.\"  Although Saran sensed 
continued ambivalence on the Pakistani side about the 
relative priority of confidence building and Kashmir within 
the Composite Dialogue, he took encouragement from the fact 
that the two sides agreed on a series of steps forward. 
 
2. (C) Enumerating specific deliverables from the December 
meetings, Saran flagged the following: 
 
-- commitment to the immediate consular notification of 
civilian detainees which will avoid the current situation in 
which official notification is not provided and citizenship 
is not confirmed until the indictment phase of criminal 
proceedings; 
 
-- agreement on the informal \"push back\" of Kashmiris, 
especially children, who wander across the LOC.  This will be 
accomplished without any kind of legal delay; 
 
-- an accord for regular meetings of local military 
commanders along the LOC; 
 
-- conclusion of a calendar for official meetings that will 
run through August/September 2005; 
 
-- Pakistan\'s proposal to open up religious shrines (which 
Saran lauded as \"an important development\"); 
 
-- and \"progress\" on pre-notification of missile tests. 
Saran said the two sides \"narrowed differences considerably\" 
and should be able to sign a final agreement in \"one or a 
few\" more rounds. 
 
3. (C) Saran was similarly upbeat about his meetings with 
Foreign Minister Kasuri and  Prime Minister Aziz.  Asked 
about transit rights to Afghanistan, Saran reported that the 
issue came up in the context of the Iran gas pipeline. 
Responding to Prime Minister Aziz\'s point about the economic 
benefits of the pipeline, Saran observed that all these 
arguments also apply to other goods that could be moved 
through Pakistan to/from Afghanistan.  Saran also noted 
Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyer\'s invitation to his 
Pakistani counterpart for talks in New Delhi on energy trade, 
and indicated that he had urged Islamabad to respond 
favorably to this Indian proposal. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Saran referred briefly to the January 3 death 
of NSA (and back channel envoy) JN Dixit -- warning this 
would leave a \"gaping hole\" in India\'s foreign policy 
line-up.  Although Indo-Pak relations are too important in 
Indian domestic politics to be controlled by any single 
individual, Dixit\'s passing cannot help the process of 
rapprochement.  With this fact in mind, septel will offer a 
more detailed MEA assessment of where the Composite Dialogue 
process now stands. End Comment.

AREAS OF INDIA 
 
REF: CHENNAI 1718 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Responding to requests for US 
Congressional travel to tsunami-devastated areas of South 
India, Foreign Secretary Saran expressed gratitude on January 
3 for the many expressions of condolence and support, but 
asked that US Codels not/not travel to South India.  Saran, 
who is India\'s representative in the Tsunami Core Group, 
noted that PM Manmohan Singh chose not to visit the affected 
areas directly, opting instead for an overflight of the 
sites, on the grounds that VIP visits would hinder relief 
efforts.  The PM has also instructed all Ministers to avoid 
travel or overflights of the affected regions and to prohibit 
Indian VIP visits to the impacted areas.  On top of these GOI 
views, India has emphasized its determination to deal with 
the effects of the tsunami through its own resources and to 
lend its resources to its neighboring countries. 
Transportation to affected areas would also pose major 
difficulties. If we seek to arrange site visits, we may find 
an unwillingness on the part of Indian authorities to give 
clearance and support for foreign VIP visits.  Local press 
reports have strongly criticized \"disaster tourism\" by Indian 
government officials, and high-level visits from the US could 
generate similar headlines.  Should Congressional visitors 
decide to travel to South India, we would attempt to provide 
whatever support is required for a successful visit. But our 
best advice is to avoid such travel in deference to the 
strong views expressed by the Government of India\'s 
leadership.  End Summary. 
 
GOI Strongly Discourages VIP Travel to Tsunami Areas 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign 
Secretary Saran indicated that the PM had directed all 
 
SIPDIS 
Ministers and VIPs to avoid the tsunami-affected regions, and 
suggested that visiting US Codels receive an Indian 
military/interagency briefing on Indian relief activities in 
New Delhi, rather than traveling to Southern India.  Saran 
noted that every time a VIP visits the region, the local 
bureaucracy and security forces have to shift their focus 
from relief activities to visitor support.  He noted that VIP 
overflights would interrupt the airflow at a time when the 
Indian military is involved in intense operational 
activities.  In this context, he reiterated, India deeply 
appreciates the many expressions of condolence and support 
that it has received, but for now is asking that US 
Congressional visitors not/not travel to South India. 
 
3.  (SBU) On January 2, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) 
Jaishankar offered a similar view, telling PolCouns that the 
GOI was \"strongly discouraging\" US Congressional travel to 
tsunami-damaged areas in India.  He noted that PM Manmohan 
 
SIPDIS 
Singh had only flown over devastated areas so as not to 
hinder relief efforts there.  Jaishankar noted that this was 
\"non-discriminatory discouragement,\" as New Delhi is 
requesting that all VIP visitors, not just those from the US, 
forego travel to disaster areas.  A senior Congress Party MP 
also expressed GOI disapproval of VIP travel to the region, 
noting that such visits could fuel the growing political 
struggle between the UPA coalition at the Center and the 
NDA-affiliated government of Tamil Nadu (Reftel). 
 
India: We Can Handle This Ourselves 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Through press reports and statements, the Indian 
government has emphasized its intention to deal with the 
effects of the tsunami through its own resources. 
Demonstrating this point, India has been providing relief aid 
to affected neighboring countries, including Sri Lanka and 
the Maldives, in addition to providing for its own 
population.  In so doing, the GOI has highlighted its role as 
an emerging global power, capable of meeting both its 
domestic needs and those of the region. 
 
Major Logistical Difficulties 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Codels Frist, Bingaman, Leach, and a possible Codel 
led by Senator Brownback, have all expressed an interest in 
touring disaster sites in South India.  Given the high number 
of proposed visitors, and the limited number of sites that 
have been affected, but are still reasonably accessible, the 
various Codels would probably visit the same areas multiple 
times.  This could provide a substantial drain on relief 
operations as government officials turn their attention to 
coordinating details of official US visits to the region. 
 
6.  (U) South Indian and military airfields are currently 
operating at over-capacity in an attempt to provide relief to 
the survivors.  As a result, the government of Tamil Nadu is 
discouraging all foreign aircraft from landing in the state. 
While it might be possible to arrange milair transport to 
Chennai, air travel to the tsunami-affected areas is 
currently unavailable.  Congressional visitors would 
therefore have to drive approximately 6 hours (each way), 
along difficult roads to reach relief sites.  Ensuring that 
Congressional delegations have proper food, water, and 
transportation as they tour disaster areas will also pose a 
logistical challenge.

1.  (SBU) Summary: India-wide, consular officers have amassed 
a database of 500 missing persons inquiries to which they are 
responding, but still have no reported Amcit casualties in 
India.  Mission engagement with the GOI on tsunami relief for 
India and the region continued with the Ambassador\'s January 
3 meeting with Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and USAID\'s 
allocation of USD 3.1 million in relief.  The Ambassador will 
meet with local media on January 4 to highlight USG disaster 
assistance efforts and our partnership in the Core Group. 
The GOI has increased its aid to neighbors with two ships 
scheduled to arrive in Aceh, even as its own casualty figures 
climb.  End Summary. 
 
Consular Outreach 
----------------- 
 
2.  (U) There are still no reported Amcit casualties in 
India, but consular officers are processing about 500 
inquiries on people who are possibly missing.  Consular New 
Delhi has been coordinating the response India-wide, 
referring calls to ConGen Chennai or ConGen Calcutta as 
necessary.  The Mission has created a database of Task Force 
calls as well as emails to ensure that each inquiry receives 
a response daily.  Consular New Delhi has an officer each in 
Thailand and Colombo supporting those missions\' operations. 
 
US Assistance for India 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Through January 3, USAID India has provided more than 
USD 1.5 million in assistance to India.  This includes: 
 
--USD 50,000 for the Prime Minister\'s Relief Fund to be spent 
at the GOI\'s discretion; 
--USD 50,000 to the Indian Red Cross for non-food and 
non-medical emergency relief; 
--USD 650,000 to CARE India for clean water and sanitation 
services; and 
--USD 750,000 to Catholic Relief Services for clean water and 
sanitation services. 
 
An additional USD 1.6 million will soon be programmed 
following the approval of proposals.  As of January 2, 3 DART 
members have been dispatched to India. 
 
Ambassador Meets Foreign Secretary Saran 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign 
Secretary Shyam Saran indicated that the PM had directed all 
 
SIPDIS 
VIPs to avoid the tsunami-affected regions, and suggested 
that visiting US Codels receive an Indian 
military/interagency briefing on Indian relief activities in 
New Delhi, rather than travel into Southern India.  Saran 
noted that to support a VIP visit, the local bureaucracy has 
to shift its focus from relief activities, and that even VIP 
overflights would be disruptive to the Indian military\'s 
intense operational activities.  While local media reported 
alleged Indian \"anger\" over Colombo\'s decision to accept US 
troops without consulting New Delhi, Saran expressed 
appreciation for the January 3 briefing on relief in the 
region that DAO provided to Indian defense staff.  (Reftel 
provides fuller details.) 
 
Indian Casualties 
----------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that through 
January 2, 9,451 Indians had died while 5,511 were missing, 
compared to 8,955 and 3,754, respectively, 24 hours earlier. 
USAID India believes these figures are low, for example, 
ConGen Calcutta\'s economics specialist has estimated six to 
seven thousand are missing in the hard hit Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands alone. 
 
Relief for the Neighbors 
------------------------ 
6.  (U) On January 3, Ministry of Defense officials briefed 
DAO on India\'s relief operations for Sri Lanka, Maldives and 
Indonesia.  The GOI expects the survey ship Nirupak, which 
has been outfitted as a 46 bed hospital, and the stealth 
frigate Khukri to arrive in Aceh early on January 4.  The 
Indian Navy now has three ships in the Maldives with the 
addition of the INS Sagar, and four ships and some 1,200 men 
in Sri Lanka. 
 
Upcoming: Ambassador\'s Press Conference 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  On the afternoon of January 4, the Ambassador will 
meet with Indian foreign affairs correspondents to discuss 
the tsunami, its aftermath, and what the USG is doing to 
assist the affected nations.

1.  (C) Summary:  Despite changes in key USG interlocutors, 
the GOI hopes to preserve momentum on high-tech trade and 
other cooperation under the Next Steps in Strategic 
Partnership (NSSP) umbrella and is looking to Washington for 
similar signals.  In a December 29 meeting with PolCouns and 
Pol-MilOff, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar 
outlined an ambitious agenda for the High Tech Cooperation 
Group (HTCG) focusing on private sector initiatives over the 
next six months while Commerce U/S Juster\'s replacement is 
identified and confirmed.  He also suggested the NSSP 
Implementation Group meet in early February to take advantage 
of US officials coming to India for other events.  Jaishankar 
underscored the need to expand US-India nuclear cooperation 
in order to build scientific support for the NSSP process and 
maintain progress on other NSSP benchmarks.  MEA Additional 
Secretary Meera Shankar echoed these points on January 4, 
 
SIPDIS 
suggesting that US-India cooperation in new areas of nuclear 
research (she mentioned the ITER fusion project) could be an 
important catalyst to Indian scientific support for the NSSP 
quid-pro-quos.  End Summary. 
 
High-Level High Tech Events in the Works 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) In an December 29 meeting focused on next steps in 
the US-India strategic relationship, MEA Joint Secretary 
(Americas) S. Jaishankar emphasized the GOI intention to 
sustain the positive momentum created by our agreement on 
Phase 1 of the NSSP.  Noting the potential convergence of key 
HTCG and NSSP players in India in February for AeroIndia and 
an international life sciences conference, PolCouns asked 
about GOI plans for leveraging these events.  Noting the GOI 
expectation that it could take several months to nominate and 
confirm a successor for Commerce Undersecretary Juster, 
Jaishankar suggested that we should focus the next few months 
on the private sector side of the HTCG.  He indicated, for 
instance, that an informal meeting of the HTCG defense 
subcommittee could happen on the margins of AeroIndia, adding 
that he had already recommended such an event to the Ministry 
of Defense, although the Confederation of Indian Industries 
(CII) would host it.  He likewise expressed interest in 
mobilizing a private sector event in the area of life 
sciences hosted by the Ministry of Science\'s Secretary for 
Biotech. 
 
Need for New Ideas on Nuclear Cooperation to Keep NSSP Moving 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
3.  (C) Noting the upcoming visit to India of Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Merrifield, PolCouns 
suggested this would be a good opportunity to rebut concern 
among the Indian scientific establishment about limited 
cooperation on nuclear issues under the NSSP.  As the first 
among equals in the Indian scientific establishment, 
Jaishankar explained, Department of Atomic Energy chairman 
Kakodkar has the ability to set the tone for other agencies. 
If he feels that India\'s nuclear sector will not benefit from 
the NSSP, Jaishankar continued, Kakodkar could retard 
progress in the other areas of NSSP cooperation (export 
controls, defense research and space).  With this in mind, 
Jaishankar appealed for a more liberal interpretation of 
nuclear safety collaboration in Phase II, noting that this 
issue was also raised in the November meeting between Foreign 
Secretary Saran and NSA Rice. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
4. (C) Jaishankar remarked on the sense among some in the GOI 
that India\'s desires for expanding cooperation with the US on 
nuclear safety are being \"brushed off\" by the Department, as 
well as general skepticism that progress on the later phases 
of the NSSP will be hampered by \"nit-picky\" lawyers.  \"We 
should be picking up momentum right now, not just cruising 
along,\" Jaishankar stated.  Echoing U/S Juster, PolCouns 
argued that \"progress begets progress,\" and urged that the 
Indian side to avoid creating the impression that New Delhi 
was trying to renegotiate the NSSP, but rather take tangible 
steps to implement it.  Jaishanker nodded his head in 
agreement, but also flagged the political problem he faces 
from the Indian nuclear establishment. 
 
5. (C) We heard a similar message in a January 4 meeting with 
our other key NSSP interlocutor, MEA Additional Secretary 
Meera Shankar.  Responding to PolCouns\' description of the 
Washington desire to maintain forward momentum on the NSSP, 
Shankar warned that the Indian nuclear establishment had 
become a real obstacle to steps such as NSG adherence and 
stronger export controls.  The scientific community, she 
claimed, believes that nothing has really changed in our 
nuclear relationship, and uses this view to argue that India 
should not change its own policies.  This dynamic, she 
continued, helps to explain the strong GOI push for a more 
flexible US interpretation of matters such as the NSG safety 
exception.  Responding to PolCouns warning that some areas of 
nuclear cooperation will remain \"a bridge too far,\" she 
suggested that cooperation in areas not restricted by the NSG 
lists might help to change the view of NSSP among India\'s 
atomic establishment.  For instance, she suggested that US 
support for India\'s involvement in the ITER fusion project 
(as proposed at the recent EU-India summit) would be an 
important step forward.  Elaborating on this theme, she 
emphasized the Indian potential to contribute to ITER, and 
asked whether a letter to this effect from the GOI to DOE 
would be helpful.  PolCouns undertook to seek guidance on 
this topic. 
 
Scheduling the Next NSSP Meeting 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) With both Shankar and Jaishankar, PolCouns pressed the 
Indians for documentation about progress on India\'s 
commitments under Phase II of the NSSP.  Since most Phase II 
steps involve revising laws and regulations, it serves 
India\'s interests to get the texts of these to us early. 
Jaishankar responded that early US identification of a date 
for the next meeting of the NSSP Implementation Group would 
enable him to start pressing the GOI bureaucracy to generate 
the required legislation and related documentation.  He 
specifically suggested that the next implementation group 
meeting be set for mid-February in Delhi in conjunction with 
the AeroIndia and the life sciences conference -- adding that 
\"with NSSP nothing gets decided until a meeting is fixed.\"

RESETTLEMENT IN THE US 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador David C. Mulford,  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) On January 3, the Dalai Lama\'s Special Representative 
Lodi Gyari told Ambassador Mulford that he had briefed MEA 
Joint Secretary (East Asia) Ashok Kantha that same day on 
Dharamsala\'s intention to relocate 10,000 Tibetan refugees 
from India and Nepal to the US.  He emphasized that he had 
spoken to the GOI \"informally,\" with the understanding that 
the US wanted to raise this issue with New Delhi separately. 
He mentioned only Dharamsala\'s wish to explore the 
possibility of resettlement to the US, but said he did not 
discuss US thoughts on the matter.  Gyari indicated that a 
significant factor in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile\'s 
(TGIE\'s) decision to pursue resettlement was Nepal\'s recent 
push back of several Tibetan refugees and the poor economic 
opportunities for Tibetan refugees in India. 
 
2.  (C) The Ambassador noted his impression that Dharamsala 
had agreed not to raise the issue with the Indian government 
until the US had broached the matter.  Gyari said that his 
intention had been \"quite the opposite,\" remarking that \"our 
relationship with India is unique, we are like family.\"  To 
keep Dharamsala\'s plans from India would therefore be 
inappropriate, he emphasized, explaining, \"we do not want 
India to misunderstand what we are trying to do.\"  Gyari told 
the Ambassador that he had not yet raised the issue with 
Kathmandu, calling the Nepalese government \"a different 
matter.\" 
 
3.  (C) Asked how the MEA had received this information, 
Gyari stated that Kantha had \"taken the information very 
well,\" acknowledging that several Tibetan settlements in 
India were facing economic challenges.

1.  (SBU) Summary: India Consular officers have been focusing 
on unaccounted for American citizens through an ongoing 
effort to respond to inquiries, and have been successful in 
resolving about 170 cases.  In a January 4 session with 
members of the local media, the Ambassador highlighted the US 
relief effort, and US-India cooperation during the disaster. 
The USAID/DART team has determined that the situation in 
India has become less of an immediate emergency.  GOI 
military assistance for Sri Lanka has reached a considerable 
level and has now moved beyond short-term relief.  The 
Ministry of Home Affairs acknowledged on January 3 that the 
number of Indian deaths is likely to grow with the addition 
of thousands of individuals currently counted as missing in 
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  End Summary. 
 
Consular Crunches the Numbers 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The consular section continues to search for 
unaccounted for American citizens in India where specific 
information is available.  Through a coordinated effort 
involving the Embassy and the three consulates, calls were 
made on January 3 and the morning of January 4 to persons in 
the US who had previously inquired about their loved ones in 
India.  As a result of this effort, the Mission resolved 
about 170 cases, bringing the number of open cases under 400. 
 Consular India will repeat the effort tonight, and hopes to 
achieve similar results. 
 
Ambassador\'s Press Conference 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) In a January 4 meeting with foreign affairs 
correspondents and editors, the Ambassador highlighted the 
immediate US response to the tsunami disaster and noted that 
the improved US-India relationship was evident in our 
coordinated relief effort.  The Ambassador appreciated New 
Delhi\'s lead role in foreign assistance for Sri Lanka and the 
broad scope of that effort.  He also explained that 
operational effectiveness based on need is one of the key 
criteria in allocating the USD 350 million that the USG has 
committed.  In response to several questions on a tsunami 
early warning system, the Ambassador emphasized the need for 
Washington and New Delhi to cooperate on developing one that 
meets India\'s needs. 
 
USAID 
----- 
 
4.  (U) USAID/DART India reports that as of January 4, the 
situation in the state of Tamil Nadu seems to be moving 
beyond the immediate emergency phase.  GOI and NGO efforts to 
provide life-saving water, sanitation, food, and shelter are 
underway.  USAID/DART is continuing assessments of needs in 
Tamil Nadu and has been receiving reports from ConGen 
Calcutta\'s FSN who is in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 
 
India in Sri Lanka 
------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU//NOFORN) Indian relief efforts in Sri Lanka have 
been underway since the day of the tsunami.  The GOI has 
conducted the initial search and rescue, carried out recovery 
operations in difficult areas, ferried relief supplies, and 
continues to work directly with the GOSL to put help where it 
is needed most.  Six Indian ships, eight helicopters and 
numerous strategic air assets are working around the clock, 
and Indian pilots are flying 18-20 hours a day.  The Indian 
Navy survey ship at Galle took soundings after the tsunami 
and their divers and engineers have already restored two of 
three berths.  They will help the Sri Lankan Navy get all 
berths in Galle open.  The field hospital set up by the GOI 
in the east has reportedly treated 1300 patients, 500 or more 
of which were children, and medical teams are established in 
various provinces providing care on the spot. 
 
6.  (SBU//NOFORN) All these assets are being effectively 
coordinated from the Indian High Commission in Colombo.  The 
Ambassador and DAO hope to receive authorization to approach 
the GOI January 5 with a formal proposal for attaching an 
Indian coordinating element to US forces in the Bay of Bengal 
region. 
 
Indian Casualty Numbers 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (U) The most recent Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) update 
indicated that on January 3, the total number of Indian 
deaths was 9,479 compared to 9,451 the day before.  The MHA 
also reported that the figure was likely to increase pending 
\"confirmation regarding 5,681 missing/feared dead (as per the 
preliminary survey) in the Nicobar Group of Islands.\" 
According to that report, the total figure for missing 
persons India-wide was 5,796.

nightly call-backs in response to tsunami-related missing 
persons inquires, have closed more than 350 cases in the last 
48 hours and expect to bring the number below 200 by January 
6.  Following the Ambassador\'s January 4 press conference, 
reports misquoted SciCouns as having said that formal 
proposals for US-India collaboration are on the table. 
Although observers in New Delhi have been enthusiastic about 
Indian assistance for Sri Lanka, at least one prominent

2.  (U) All consular officers across India have been engaged 
in a nightly, after-hours effort to re-contact persons in the 
US who have inquired about loved ones, making every effort to 
locate the missing.  As a result of this country-wide 
approach, consular India has closed more than 350 cases in 
the last 48 hours, and hopes to have the list of open cases 
down to less than 200 by Thursday morning, at which point New 
Delhi will transfer responsibility for all open cases back to 
ConGen Chennai.  Reconsolidating responsibility should help 
focus consular\'s efforts and avoid potentially dropped-balls 
as officers work to account for the remaining missing.  All 
New Delhi consular officers lent to other posts in the region 
(including one who was vacationing in Phuket and stepped in 
to provide ACS support) are expected back on the visa line by 
Monday, January 10. 
 
Tsunami Science 
 
SIPDIS 
--------------- 
 
3.  (U) At the Ambassador\'s January 4 briefing, the press 
demonstrated considerable interest in tsunami alert/warning 
systems and US collaboration with India to develop sea level 
monitoring systems (reftel).  The \"Times of India\" misquoted 
SciCouns stating that \"we had a proposal from India to set up 
a network of tidal ocean level gauges in the Bay of Bengal,\" 
but in fact we have not yet received any formal Indian 
proposals for cooperation in this area.  On January 6, the 
Mission expects to learn more about the team of experts that 
Department of Science and Technology Secretary VS Ramamurthy 
plans to call together to advise the GOI on monitoring 
systems. 
 
Watching Where the Aid Goes in Sri Lanka 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) While GOI disaster relief for Sri Lanka has been a 
source of pride for Indians, Janata Party president 
Subramanian Swamy has expressed concern over which parts of 
the country New Delhi\'s assistance reaches.  On December 30, 
Swamy reportedly requested the GOI to ensure that its aid 
does not make its way to the LTTE or the Tamil Rehabilitation 
Organization (TRO), which he considers an LTTE front.  He 
also urged the US to look into the role of the TRO in the 
United States as a conduit for aid to the LTTE. 
 
Death Toll in India Climbing 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reported that 
through January 4, 9,575 Indians had died as a result of the 
tsunami, an increase of nearly 100 from the previous day. 
 
SIPDIS 
The MHA also revised the number of missing to 5,918 (from 
5,681 on January 3), of which 5,801 are from the Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands. 
 
Andaman and Nicobar: \"98% Done\" 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Despite the number of individuals still missing, Vice 
Admiral Raman Puri, Chief of the Integrated Defense Staff 
(IDS), was quoted in local press reports as having announced 
that 98 percent of immediate relief work in the Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands had been completed.  The GOI noted that 
search and rescue and relief operations are coming to an end 
and the next phase of recovery and reconstruction operations 
are underway.  International NGOs are still prohibited from 
operating in the Nicobar Islands, which are militarily 
sensitive. 
 
The Neighbors Pitch in For India 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) On January 4 media reports indicated that Indian 
helicopters, which cannot fly from the eastern part of the 
country to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands alone, have flown 
via Burma.  The GOI confirmed this to DAO, noting that eight 
MI-17 helicopters stopped for refueling in Rangoon before 
proceeding to the Islands.  India has also reportedly 
received similar support from Bangladesh for helicopter 
operations from Bangladesh. 
 
Only the Beginning in Indonesia 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) India\'s relief for Indonesia, Operation Gambhir, is 
just getting underway, according to the Ministry of Defense. 
Two Indian Navy vessels, a survey ship, the INS Nirupak, 
which the GOI converted to a hospital, and the INS Khukri, 
which left from Chennai on December 31 carrying tents, 
blankets, emergency rations, and emergency medical supplies, 
have reached or will soon arrive in Aceh, the MEA reported. 
Defense officials told DAO that Indian assistance for 
Indonesia will be expanded.

Secretary Shyam Saran called in the press corps on January 5. 
 
SIPDIS 
 Press reports emphasized that the GOI is not concerned about 
US presence \"in the neighborhood.\"  Saran reportedly 
underlined that while India was \"spearheading\" relief in Sri

4.  (U) In a January 6 briefing on the Foreign Minister\'s 
participation in the Jakarta Summit, the MEA spokesman 
reported that the FM emphasized to Kofi Annan that \"India as 
well as other countries present there supported the UN in its 
efforts to bring relief to the affected people in the 
region.\"  The MEA noted that the Minister and Annan \"also 
discussed regional issues, including Iraq.\" 
 
USAID: Increasing Multilateral Cooperation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (U) On January 6, representatives of the USAID/DART team 
and USAID/India attended a coordination meeting in New Delhi 
chaired by the UN.  USAID agreed to share information on 
assessments and activities with the UN, the UK\'s Department 
for International Development (DIFD) and the European 
Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).  On January 5 and 6, 
USAID/DART conducted assessments of villages near Pondicherry 
in Tamil Nadu.  The USAID/DART team reports that 
water/sanitation is not an emergency need but the restoration 
of livelihoods is emerging as a key concern.  In some 
villages, residents have begun repairing their homes.

in India, compared to 9,575 through January 4.  The MHA still 
considers approximately 6,000 individuals missing, although 
they have indicated the likelihood that the unaccounted for 
figure will be added to death total.  According the January 6 
MHA report, seven Indian nationals died in Sri Lanka, one in 
the Maldives, three in Thailand, and two in Indonesia. 
 
PM to Visit Andaman and Nicobar 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Amid press complaints that the GOI is not doing 
enough for the isolated archipelago, Prime Minister Manmohan 
Singh will reportedly travel to the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands on January 8.  After the PM\'s trip, an all-party 
meeting to discuss the disaster will be held on January 9, 
two days later than originally scheduled.

SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INDIAN MPAT PLANNERS AND LIAISON 
OFFICERS TO CSF-536 AND PACOM HEADQUARTERS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador David Mulford.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C)  This message responds to State action request: ref 
060115Z Jan 05 SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR COUNTRY LIAISON OFFICERS 
FOR TSUNAMI ASSISTANCE AND PACOM REQUEST. 
 
2.  (C)  Based on directions in cable (ref para 1), and 
communications between USPACOM J-5, OSD, and USDAO New Delhi, 
Ambassador today delivered a formal letter of request to 
India\'s Defense Secretary, India\'s Foreign Secretary, and 
National Security Advisor as follows: 
 
A.  That India send two military officers to work within 
CSF-536\'s Multi-National Planning and Augmentation Team 
(MPAT) in Utapao, Thailand, and that these MPAT planners be 
selected from a list of Indian officers who have been 
participants in TEMPEST Express and other PACOM sponsored 
MPAT exercises and conferences. 
 
B.  That India sends a Liaison officer to CSF-536 in Utapao. 
This officer will be involved in coordinating information 
about current Indian military operations in support of 
regional relief efforts and receiving the same information 
concerning US and other militaries regional relief operations. 
 
C.  That India sends a liaison officer to PACOM Headquarters 
at Camp Smith, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  This individual will be 
involved in strategic level coordination of international 
military relief operations for the affected region, and 
interact with the Joint Operations Center cell at PACOM and 
with other foreign liaison officers. 
 
D.  Letter specifies that this request takes effect 
immediately and requests the MPAT planners and the LNO to 
Utapao arrive no later than 10 Jan 2005.   The LNO to PACOM 
should arrive as soon as possible.  Currently, transportation 
to both locations would be on a self-funded/arranged basis. 
Letter stated that PACOM is working on providing 
administrative support, subsistence, and transportation for 
international liaison officers to Camp Smith.  Indian 
personnel to Utapao should be administratively 
self-sufficient, deploying with field gear and laptop 
computer. 
 
E. Ambassador\'s letter mentions US force lay down for Tsunami 
relief operations, CSF-536 organizational structure and 
subordinate elements, to include the Combined Support Groups 
on the ground in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. 
Ambassador pointed out that US and Indian military attaches 
and relief support personnel are already communicating and 
effectively sharing information on the ground in Sri Lanka. 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador first mentioned this proposal today via 
phonecon with National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan, and 
followed up with hard copy of letter delivered to Narayanan\'s 
office.  Narayanan said he would brief the Prime Minister. 
Ambassador sent a copy of the request to India\'s Foreign 
Secretary Saran.  (Foreign Minister Natwar Singh is in 
 
SIPDIS 
Indonesia). 
 
4.  (C)  Because of a medical appointment, Defense Minister 
Mukherjee was unavailable.  Instead, Ambassador and DATT met 
with India\'s Defense Secretary A.V. Singh and handed him the 
letter of request, in additional to background information on 
the MPAT program, and MPAT Tempest Express 7 which India 
co-hosted in July-Aug 2004. Also present were MEA Joint 
Secretary (Canada and US) S. Jaishankar, and MOD Joint 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary G. Mukhopadhaya (International Cooperation). 
 
SIPDIS 
 
5.  (C)  Singh politely accepted the Ambassador\'s letter and 
told the Ambassador he would study the proposal, brief 
Defense Minister Mukherjee, and would soon get back with the 
Ambassador.  Singh said that perhaps we all could meet again 
to discuss it after they studied it.  Singh then asked 
several questions about the CSF-536 organization.  Singh 
asked how this set up interacts with the UN in the relief 
efforts and how and if the UN was in the picture. 
Mukhopadhaya asked what is the relationship between the 
CSF-536 effort involving multinationals and the ASEAN Special 
Summit convened to deal with relief efforts?  Singh wondered 
aloud whether or not the best level to deal with the 
requirements for recovery-reconstruction efforts, would be at 
the local level, and whether having planners so far removed 
from the scene would be more effective.  Singh also raised a 
concern that we should take care that the local government of 
affected states not feel that they are being dictated to by 
planners removed from the sc 
ene. Mukhopadhaya asked for a list of countries that are 
participating in the CSF, LNOs, and MPAT planners.  Singh 
asked how long this effort was envisaged to last and what is 
the time scale that the planners would be planning for. 
 
6.  (C)  DATT reviewed the success of MPAT Tempest Express 7 
and reiterated that the MPAT exercise effort had trained 
military planners for exactly the kind of scenario that has 
unfolded and that India has a ready trained cadre of 
planners.  DATT review the rationale for LNOs at CSF-536 and 
PACOM Headquarters.  Ambassador reiterated that with the 
success of Indo-US military cooperation programs, we now have 
a great opportunity to operationalize the 
military-to-military relationship.  Singh thanked the 
Ambassador for having presented the letter and looked forward 
to further discussion on the proposal.  Ambassador and DATT 
departed Singh\'s office approximately 30 minutes prior the 
scheduled phone call to Singh from USD(P) on the same 
subjects.

SUBJECT: AID TO THE TIGERS: ON THE SAME PAGE 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  In a January 7 meeting with MEA Director 
(Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives) Taranjit Singh Sandhu, 
PolCouns explained the USG position on tsunami disaster 
relief for Tiger controlled areas in Sri Lanka, including the 
US intention not to deploy military forces to LTTE areas. 
Sandhu responded that the GOI had taken a similar track, and 
expressed surprise at the contrast between the reality of US 
involvement in Sri Lanka and what had been reported in the 
Indian media.  On the future of GOSL-LTTE relations, Sandhu 
was optimistic that some good could come of the disaster in 
that it might force the two sides to cooperate.  PolCouns 
reiterated the need for greater information sharing on 
Bangladesh.  End Summary. 
 
Tigers? 
------- 
 
2.  (C) Sandhu remarked that his sense after sifting through 
all the speculation surrounding the damage the LTTE may have 
sustained from the tsunami, was that the Tigers did receive a 
blow, but not so much to their Sea Tigers headquarters.  He 
thought that probably one or two bases had been wiped out, 
adding that casualty figures have been kept very quiet, but 
the figure of two to three hundred LTTE deaths is \"nonsense.\" 
 
 
GOI Aid to the LTTE 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The GOI has \"no problem\" with Indian assistance 
flowing through the GOSL to LTTE areas, Sandhu explained, 
adding that suggesting New Delhi\'s help should be cut off 
from the Tamil insurgents would be to acknowledge a separate 
Tamil Eelam.  He noted, however, that New Delhi found 
\"unacceptable\" the LTTE statement that aid should be given 
directly to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization.  PolCouns 
explained that the USG approach was similar, adding that we 
have conveyed the message that US relief could be channeled 
through others, but that no US military deployments or 
military relief projects would take place in Tiger controlled 
areas. 
 
4.  (C) PolCouns also clarified the extent of the US military 
presence in Sri Lanka which has attracted considerable media 
attention in India, including suggestions that the GOI needs 
to check US intrusion in India\'s \"backyard.\"  Sandhu seemed 
surprised to learn that the widely reported figure of 1,500 
US troops in the country was incorrect, and that the USG was 
going to refocus some military assets on Indonesia because 
India was doing a very good job of providing assistance to 
Sri Lanka.  (Note: We have heard from others that the Indian 
Embassy in Colombo has been a source of some of these 
alarmist reports about US military plans for Sri Lanka.) 
Sandhu responded that it was \"wishful thinking\" on the part 
of the LTTE that a disaster relief turf war would drive a 
wedge between the US and India.  Sandhu was also unaware that 
conversations between Washington and New Delhi had taken 
place through the core group before any US military movement 
into Sri Lanka.  Characterizing NSA JN Dixit\'s death as a set 
back to Indian diplomacy, Sandhu commented that this was 
especially true of policy towards Colombo, because Dixit (who 
had been Ambassador there) knew the country so well. 
 
In the Long Term 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C) Sandhu predicted that the tsunami could have long 
term political implications in Sri Lanka.  What at one time 
seemed like critical issues in the conflict seem irrelevant 
in light of the much larger issue of surviving the disaster, 
he explained.  Neither the GOSL or the Tigers are in any 
position to resume armed conflict, he observed, and they may 
be \"forced\" to cooperate.  If both sides see the current 
situation as an opportunity, he continued, that could be the 
\"silver lining\" in this tragedy.  He added, parenthetically, 
that Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had canceled his scheduled 
mid-January trip to Sri Lanka. 
The Other Neighbor 
------------------ 
 
6.  (C) With a meeting between PM Manmohan Singh and 
Bangladeshi PM Khaleda Zia postponed until the SAARC Summit 
is rescheduled, Sandhu told PolCouns he has not yet seen \"the 
light at the end of the tunnel\" in New Delhi-Dhaka relations. 
 He remarked that New Delhi has yet to concur with the 
proposed February 7 date for the SAARC meeting, and expressed 
puzzlement at Dhaka\'s insistence on pushing ahead with the 
Summit at a time when three of the region\'s governments were 
reeling from the tsunami.  PolCouns used the opportunity to 
further encourage more GOI information sharing on the issue 
through any channel, including the CTJWG.  Sandhu agreed \"in 
principle\" and offered to take the suggestion higher.

REF: 04 CHENNAI 1718 
 
Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The unprecedented scale of the Tsunami 
disaster has compelled India\'s usually contentious political 
coalitions to bury their differences and cooperate to relieve 
the suffering.  Likewise, elements of the Left which strongly 
oppose the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government\'s 
economic reform efforts have let up somewhat in their 
criticism.  This has not prevented individual parties, 
especially within Tamil Nadu (reftel) from attempting to use 
the Tsunami for political reasons.  This is likely to 
backfire, however. as the Indian public is in no mood for 
partisanship on the issue.  The Tsunami has also focused the 
GOI inward, which may slow progress on Indo-Pak relations, 
the postponed SAARC Summit and other pressing foreign policy 
issues for the time being.  End Summary. 
 
Burying Hostility for Now 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) India\'s two main coalitions, the UPA and the 
opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), have agreed to 
downplay their political differences to meet the national 
emergency resulting from the Tsunami.  On December 31, 
opposition leaders Atal Behari Vajpayee and LK Advani met 
with PM Manmohan Singh to discuss how the two alliances could 
work together to alleviate the suffering of Tsunami victims. 
the UPA and BJP also agreed to go ahead with India\'s annual 
Republic Day parade scheduled for later in January.  After 
the meeting, the PM\'s spokesman noted that the opposition and 
the government believe that \"this is a national calamity and 
together we should face it.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) This new spirit of cooperation was evident in the 
January 9 editorial in the pro-BJP \"Pioneer,\" which is a 
harsh critic of the UPA.  Saying that this \"is not an 
occasion to score debating points,\" columnist Swapan Dasgupta 
praised the UPA government for its \"clarity and focus,\" 
noting that \"discordant notes have been overwhelmed by a 
burst of generosity, energy and far-sightedness,\" and urged 
Indians to overcome partisan politics. 
 
Left Tones Down Criticism 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The Left Parties, which have been sparring for 
months with the UPA over economic policy, also appear more 
cooperative.  Gurudas Dasgupta the General Secretary of the 
Communist Party of India (CPI) labor federation (AITUC) told 
reporters on January 3 that \"we are dedicating the whole of 
January to Tsunami and cooperation with the government.  We 
differ with the government on important policies.  But we 
have told the PM there is no question of us expressing these 
views this entire one month.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) The CPI did not publicly back Dasgupta\'s statement, 
however, with CPI Secretary D. Raja denying any plans to 
call-off confrontation.  A January 3 article in the Communist 
Party of India-Marxist (CPM) newspaper \"People\'s Democracy\" 
pledged CPM \"support for the government in relief and 
rehabilitation.\" 
 
Some Residual Partisanship 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) While the two alliances have forsworn 
confrontation, some individual parties have used the Tsunami 
for political purposes.  The CPM reacted with scorn to a BJP 
claim that Goa was not hurt by the Tsunami because it had a 
BJP government, with CMP leader Nilotpal Basu arguing that 
\"the people experienced a Tsunami of hatred for five years 
under the NDA regime,\" and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury noting 
that, \"contrary to what the BJP people are saying, the 
Tsunami is no ominous signal.\" 
 
SIPDIS 
 
7.  (SBU) It appears that the Tsunami has become a divisive 
issue only in Tamil Nadu.  Janata Party President Subramaniam 
Swamy demanded that UPA Ministers from Tamil Nadu resign, as 
the UPA government had \"betrayed the state in the allocation 
of funds from the PM\'s relief fund.\"  He claimed that all 
money raised for the fund was being diverted to UPA coffers. 
The opposition DMK party also attacked the ruling AIDMK 
government headed by Chief Minister Jayalalitha, accusing it 
of nonperformance (reftel). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The Tsunami has brought about a period of relative 
quiet from the normally harsh partisanship and mudslinging 
that characterizes Indian politics.  Politicians have largely 
refrained from conflict and embraced cooperation, although a 
minority has tried to use the disaster for partisan purposes. 
 Political campaigning for the February elections in Bihar, 
Jharkhand, and Haryana has been more restrained than usual. 
If this period of amity persists, the elections could be 
relatively quiet affairs. 
9.  (C) The massive relief effort has also shifted the GOI 
focus inward, and may delay decision making on regional 
issues like the India Pakistan Composite Dialogue and 
determining a new date for the postponed SAARC Summit.

1.  (C) Summary: Senators Frist, McConnell, DeWine and 
Coleman discussed a broad range of issues with PM Manmohan 
Singh during their January 10 meeting, including US-India 
ties, Tsunami disaster relief, democratization in Burma, 
HIV/AIDS, trade and the WTO, Iraq, NSSP, Indo-Pak relations, 
and UNSC reform.  The PM remained non-committal regarding 
expanding Indian involvement in Iraq beyond providing 
election assistance.  End Summary. 
 
Close Bilateral Ties 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Emphasizing the importance India places on the 
US/India relationship, the PM referred to the NSSP, 
investment, growing trade, and India\'s desire for FDI from 
the US, emphasizing specifically bilateral cooperation in 
counterterrorism, halting WMD proliferation, and working with 
the US within the WTO to establish a non-discriminatory 
trading system.  Noting that India\'s relations with the US 
were \"of the highest priority,\" he expressed his desire to 
\"deepen and broaden\" ties, especially in the high-tech and 
defense areas.  The PM pointed out that he had met with 
President Bush in New York on the margins of the UNGA last 
fall, and was looking forward to seeing him again this year. 
Stating that there was a growing convergence between Indian 
and US interests, based in part on our strong democratic 
traditions, PM Singh called the US and India \"partners.\"  He 
hoped that Indian expertise in IT and biotech would further 
bilateral cooperation, and explained that the GOI wants to 
create an \"environment for entrepreneurship in India,\" so 
that its citizens would no longer have to emigrate.  Senator 
Frist responded by underlining his wish to build on growing 
US-India ties, which now include a strong Indian-American 
dimension. 
Disaster Relief 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C) After extending condolences regarding the Tsunami 
disaster, Senator Frist referred to his previous stop in Sri 
Lanka, where the Sri Lankan President had expressed gratitude 
to India for its support, noting that New Delhi had gained in 
respect internationally both as a victim and a donor.  The PM 
thanked the US for its support and assistance to the GOI 
Tsunami relief effort, adding that he deeply appreciated the 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary\'s visit to the Indian Embassy in Washington.  The 
 
SIPDIS 
PM characterized the establishment of the \"core group\" as a 
\"good and timely\" step.  Noting that for India the suffering 
was restricted to its South and Eastern islands, the PM hoped 
that future Indian economic development would take such 
potential disasters into account. 
 
Democratization in Burma 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Senator McConnell asked the PM whether he was 
troubled by India\'s ties with the Burmese junta, and how he 
felt about hosting General Than Shwe last October.  PM Singh 
replied that he holds ASSK in very high regard for the values 
she promotes, but pointed out that India has a 1400 kilometer 
land border with Burma, as well as 850 kilometers of shared 
coastline along the Bay of Bengal, and that the insurgents in 
some of India\'s northeastern states take shelter in Burma. 
These factors compel India and Burma to talk, he said, and 
recalled that he had told both General Than Shwe and the 
Indian Parliament that Burma must do everything possible to 
honor its own previously stated commitment to restore 
democracy. 
 
HIV/AIDS 
-------- 
 
5.  (C) In response to Senator DeWine\'s question about how 
India was dealing with HIV/AIDS and the role the 
international community could play in these efforts, the PM 
pointed out that there were now five million AIDS sufferers 
in India.  Characterizing AIDS as a \"major national problem,\" 
he said that it could affect India\'s economic development, 
especially because of its impact on the young.  Stressing 
that the GOI takes the problem \"very seriously,\" he noted his 
engagement with youth in his fight against AIDS.  While 
culture often prevents open discussion of this issue, he had 
met with the media to enlist their support.  The PM expressed 
appreciation for the support of American and international 
donor organizations in this battle, and noted that the GOI 
would commit more resources. 
Trade and the WTO 
----------------- 
 
6.  (C) Senator Coleman then asked how the US and India could 
work better together on trade/WTO issues, and Senator Frist 
pointed out that the USG would like to see more GOI action on 
economic reform, including lower tariffs and improved IPR 
protection.  In response, the PM said that both countries 
want to improve the WTO, and he wants to ensure that it will 
provide a rule-based, non-discriminatory framework for 
international trade.  He was pleased with the last round of 
WTO talks, in which he said the US and India had worked 
closely together.  The PM reiterated that the GOI is 
committed to moving forward together with the US, has already 
introduced an ordinance to prevent copyright infringement, 
and expects to introduce legislation to enshrine these 
measures into law. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
7.  (C) Senator Frist noted that it is clear there will be an 
election in Iraq on January 30, and bringing democracy and 
stability to Iraq must be a real international effort, given 
that the outcome there effects everyone, including India. 
Responding, PM Singh expressed his support for US efforts in 
Iraq and agreed that it was crucial that the election be held 
as scheduled.  It was vital, the PM said, that the US succeed 
in Iraq as it has in Afghanistan, although Iraq is a more 
complex and dangerous situation.  He reiterated India\'s offer 
to train election officials for Iraq in India.  Senator 
McConnell pointed out that there are two more elections 
scheduled in Iraq for 2005, one to ratify the new 
constitution, and one to elect a new government at the end of 
the year, and encouraged the PM to help with Iraqi elections 
running into the future. 
 
NSSP 
---- 
 
8.  (C) Emphasizing that the USG would like to reinforce and 
support the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) and 
expand talks on Missile Defense, Senator Frist commented that 
the US and India need to improve export control 
implementation and enforcement to achieve their joint NSSP 
goals.  The PM replied that India takes its nonproliferation 
obligations seriously, has strong export controls, and wants 
to halt the spread of WMD. 
 
India/Pakistan Relations 
------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Commenting that US relations with India and Pakistan 
were not a \"zero-sum\" game and that they should develop 
independently, Senator Frist noted that the US fully supports 
a bilateral Indo-Pak approach to Kashmir.  PM Singh responded 
that India is committed to solving all outstanding issues 
with Islamabad, although any settlement must be based on 
ground realities, as India cannot support changes of 
boundaries, especially when based on religion, as this would 
undermine India\'s secular character, and be unacceptable to 
the public at large.  Instead, he noted, people on both sides 
of the LOC should have greater opportunities to travel and 
trade.  Since India is a \"status quo power,\" it wishes 
Pakistan well and hopes it can bring its problems with 
terrorism and extremism under control. 
 
United Nations Reform 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Senator Coleman ended the meeting by pointing out 
that both India and the US want a \"credible, effective, 
transparent UN,\" and hoped that both countries could work 
together on UN reform.  The PM replied that India agrees that 
the UN is in need of reform and seeks a permanent seat on the 
UNSC. 
 
11.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

Classified By: Ambassador David C. Mulford, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: On January 7, India and Iran strengthened 
significantly their oil and gas relationship when they 
reached an agreement in which India will purchase a total of 
7.5 million tons per year (MMTA) of LNG for 25 years 
beginning in 2009.  Iran will reportedly  allow Indian 
state-controlled companies to participate in at least three 
upstream oil and gas projects (South Pars, Yadavaran, and 
Jufeyr).  Although the deal has not been formalized and the 
contracts have not been signed, the LNG and upstream 
investment elements of the deal appear to be quite firm.  If 
the deal goes through, it could have ILSA implications.  We 
will continue to raise our concerns with both the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and with the oil companies, all of which are 
aware of our ILSA concerns.  The deal also included proposals 
for an Indian and Iran state-controlled companies to 
cooperate in petrochemical manufacturing and CNG development. 
The package represents still further evidence that the Indian 
oil companies, cheered on by the GOI, are vigorously seeking 
properties abroad.  The two governments also decided to 
discuss in February issues relating to an Iran-Pakistan-India 
gas pipeline.  With the GOI\'s decision to enter into large 
and long-term LNG purchase agreements, Embassy believes that 
the commerical prospects of an Iran-Pakistan-India gas 
pipeline recede further even as the idea remains a topic of 
Iran-India diplomacy.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) India took some significant steps in intensifying its 
oil and gas relationship with Iran and strengthening its 
energy security during the first weekend of January.  After 
more than a year of negotiations, the two countries reached a 
wide-ranging oil and gas package agreement on the sidelines 
of January 6-7 Asian Oil Ministers meeting in New Delhi.  The 
announcement was made on January 7 by India Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Minister Mani Shanker Aiyar and Iranian Oil 
Minister Bijan Namdar Zanghneh.  The deal has not been 
formally signed and has some ways to go before the various 
elements are concluded.  Some parts of the deal such as 
proposed participation by Indian state-controlled companies 
in Iran\'s oil and gas sector could be ILSA-sanctionable 
depending on the nature of the participation and how the 
contracts are structured.  The GOI and the Indian oil 
companies, none of which have any significant U.S. interests 
or presence, are well aware of our ILSA concerns.  We will 
continue to raise our concerns with both the Ministry of 
External Affairs and with the oil companies. 
 
Large LNG Deal 
-------------- 
 
3.  (U) For India, the most significant and firm element of 
the package deal is the commitment to buy 7.5 million metric 
tons of LNG per year for 25 years beginning in 2009.  The 
state-controlled Indian companies Indian Oil Corporation 
(IOC) and GAIL India Limited will purchase the LNG from the 
National Iranian Gas Export Corporation (NIGEC).  It is not 
clear which Iranian field will supply this gas. 
 
4.  (SBU) Much of the delay in reaching the LNG agreement was 
over pricing.  An official of GAIL told Econoff that the 
Indian companies will buy the gas at a price that is capped 
at $3.21 per million british thermal unit (MBTU).  The price 
will be fixed at $2.97 per unit for three years, after which 
it will be allowed to float at a formula that comprises a 
fixed price of $1.2 per unit plus 6.25 percent of the Brent 
crude price.  The Indian companies had resisted the link to 
crude prices but conceded after the maximum allowable Brent 
crude price was fixed at $31 per barrel. 
 
5.  (SBU) The India companies are not getting as good a price 
as they have in place for ExxonMobil\'s RasGas from Qatar. 
The price for this gas is fixed at $2.53 per unit until 2008, 
after which it will be linked to crude in the $16-24 range. 
Nonetheless, GAIL Chairman Proshonto Banerjee said \"In the 
present circumstances, it is a good deal.\" 
A Second LNG Deal 
----------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The two government\'s also endorsed a December 
agreement between IOC and the Iranian oil company Petropars 
for a 40 percent IOC share in the development of one of the 
blocks in South Pars gas field (Ref A).  IOC would also get 
60 percent stake in a 9 MMTPA LNG liquefaction plant related 
to this development.  The 25-year agreement would provide IOC 
about 4.5 MMTPA of LNG.  Total development costs of this 
project are estimated at $3.2 billion.  GAIL had loudly 
complained about being left out of the deal in December, 
claiming that GOI policy has been to allow Indian 
state-controlled energy companies to invest overseas only in 
a consortium.  GAIL removed its opposition after it was 
brought into the overall package.  The LNG imported in the 
two deals -- the 4.5 MMPTA from South Pars and the 7.5 MMPTA 
(para 2) will be marketed in India by GAIL, IOC, ONGC, and 
Oil India Limited in the 40:25:25:10 proportions. 
 
Other Parts of the Package 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Yadavaran: ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the overseas 
arm of the Indian state-run oil exploration company Oil and 
Natural Gas Corporation, will get a 20 percent share in the 
development of Iran\'s on-shore Yadavaran oil field.  This 
equity stake is equivalent to about 60,000 barrels per day. 
 
8.  (U) Jufeyr:  OVL will get a 100 percent stake in the 
Iran\'s Jufeyr field.  This field is expected to yield 30,000 
per day when developed. 
 
9.  (U) Bandar Assaluyeh:  Iran offered IOC participation in 
a petrochemical complex under development at Bandar 
Assaluyeh.  The proposed terms for taking part in the project 
were not disclosed. 
 
10.  (U) CNG: GAIL proposed investing in development of CNG 
for Teheran and Esfahan and signed an agreement with the Iran 
Fuel Conservation Organization for cooperation on CNG 
development. 
 
11. (SBU) Pipeline:  An Iranian team will visit India in 
February to discuss issues relating to trans-Pakistan gas 
pipeline.  The Indian official who backgrounded the overall 
agreement for the media downplayed the importance of these 
discussions by emphasizing that security of gas supplies 
remained a key issue. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) Although some parts of the deal are merely 
commitments for further discussion, India\'s agreement to buy 
Iranian gas and invest in Iranian upstream oil and gas 
developments appear to be quite firm.  The deal is huge for 
India -- its 12 MMTPA of LNG represents about half of India\'s 
current natural gas production.  Together with the 5 MMTPA 
imported from ExxonMobil\'s RasGas development, India is 
becoming a major player in the Asian LNG markets.  The deal 
represents still further evidence that the Indian oil 
companies, cheered on by the GOI, are vigorously seeking 
properties abroad.  The GOI\'s goal is to enhance Indian 
energy security.  The oil companies, especially IOC, aspire 
to become international players who can compete with the 
majors. 
 
13.  (C) With the GOI\'s decision to enter into such large and 
long-term LNG purchase agreements, Embassy believes that the 
commerical prospects of an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline 
recede further.  Mani Shanker Aiyar stirred up a flurry of 
excitement about such a project soon after he assumed office 
last summer.  The excitement appears to have abated now as 
conditions -- first MFN, then transit rights through Pakistan 
-- have been appended at the insistence of MEA\'s Pakistan 
hands.  MEA Joint Secretary Jaishanker told Ambassador that 
he believes, despite Aiyar\'s enthusiasm, the obstacles to a 
trans-Pakistan pipeline are enormous.  He characterized 
Aiyar\'s public statements in support of a pipeline as \"more 
smoke than fire.\" 
 
14.  (C) Embassy notes that large and expensive projects such 
as a 3,000 kilometer pipeline generally require a private 
sector backer and promoter.  We are not aware that any 
international oil and gas company has shown an interest in 
becoming involved.  Our contacts in the Indian oil and gas 
industry are not enthusiastic, saying that the pipeline is 
probably not economically viable given the extra risk 
management costs involved and the projections of alternative 
sources of supply.  In any case, to our knowledge no serious 
cost-benefit analysis has been done.

SUBJECT: AFTER DIXIT, INDIA PONDERS ROLE OF ITS NSA AND WHO 
WILL GET THE JOB 
 
REF: 04 CHENNAI 575 
 
Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake,  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Two questions now swirl around India\'s 
National Security Advisor position: will it lose its major 
role in the Indian foreign policy establishment, and who will 
land the job permanently?  JN Dixit\'s death has prompted 
media speculation that PM Manmohan Singh is reassessing what 
he wants from his next NSA and how the NSA system should 
function.  This has led Indian strategic commentators to 
posit that the NSC structure may be reinvigorated as the 
Congress Party pledged during last year\'s election campaign. 
That structural issue notwithstanding, Special Adviser to PM 
Singh and Acting NSA MK Narayanan clearly has the inside 
track to succeed Dixit, based on proximity and personal 
relations with Mrs. Gandhi, but there are also other serious 
contenders.  This cable provides biographic information on 
Narayanan.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) JN Dixit\'s untimely death on January 3 has set the 
stage for changes in the NSA position and the NSC system that 
were predicted but never came to fruition after last May\'s 
change of government.  According to numerous well informed 
press accounts and non-government contacts, the PMO is 
treating Dixit\'s death as an opportunity to re-evaluate and 
perhaps re-engineer the national security architecture at a 
time of relative quiet in India-Pakistan relations and Indian 
foreign policy generally.  The loss of the incumbent NSA, and 
his interim replacement with a seasoned bureaucrat who 
already has a good working relationship with the PM, gives 
the GOI breathing space to tweak the NSA/NSC system, and 
Indian strategic thinkers have been quick to suggest changes. 
 
The Next NSA: Less Adviser, More Chairman? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) The buzz surrounding PM Singh\'s decision to rethink 
what the NSA and NSC should do -- irrespective of who holds 
the post -- is based on the 2004 Congress Party election 
platform pledge to make the NSC \"a professional and effective 
institution.\"  This in turn was a dig at Brajesh Mishra\'s 
role as the power behind Vajpayee on a broad range of 
political and foreign policy matters.  Structural changes 
were predicted after Congress came to power last May, but 
faded quickly from the agenda following Dixit\'s rapid 
occupation of the same \"super minister\" role played by his 
predecessor.  Speculation lingers around a partial shift in 
the NSA\'s work balance away from its current advisory role 
toward greater management of the NSC as an organization.  Any 
substantial redefinition of the position would probably take 
some time (and a measure of conscious self-restraint by the 
incumbent).  However, the current calm in Indo-Pak relations 
and the presence of an experienced hand as Acting NSA will 
provide breathing space to do so. 
 
4.  (C) The eminence grise of Indian strategic thinkers, K 
Subramanyam, has been arguing that India needs an NSA at the 
helm of a fully functioning NSC dedicated to addressing 
India\'s strategic needs, as originally mandated.  In a series 
of essays, he has argued for the NSA to play this role, 
rather than being the PM\'s point-man on the foreign affairs 
issues of the day, as the position became when Mishra and 
Dixit held it.  \"Indian Express\" strategic affairs editor 
Jasjit Singh has observed that much of Mishra\'s authority 
grew out of his other role as Principal Secretary to the PM, 
which removed the impetus to create a durable NSC that 
remains absent to this day.  \"Hindustan Times\" foreign 
affairs correspondent and National Security Advisory Board 
(NSAB) member Manoj Joshi wrote recently that PM Singh\'s 
reassessment would provide an opportunity to split the NSA 
away from dealing with Islamabad, most notably through the 
back-channel with Pakistan\'s NSA Tariq Aziz, and to put this 
issue \"back where it belongs\" -- in the Foreign Ministry.  A 
January 6 \"Times of India\" news report speculated that the 
internal and external security elements of the NSA position 
might be bifurcated. 
5.  (C) Redefining the NSA as the active NSC chair also poses 
a geographical problem if it is to remain in the forefront of 
GOI policymaking.  Mishra and Dixit sat in the PMO, down the 
hall from the MEA, which kept them firmly in the loop on 
foreign policy decisionmaking.  The NSC staff, in contrast, 
works out of a decrepit building on the other side of town, 
far from the corridors of influence.  For now, this location 
symbolizes the NSC\'s marginal role in Indian foreign 
policymaking. 
 
Narayanan Has the Edge 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (C) By most accounts, PM Singh,s Special Advisor MK 
(\"Mike\") Narayanan, who became Acting National Security 
Advisor on January 4 after Dixit\'s death, has the inside 
track to become his permanent replacement.  Narayanan brings 
over four decades of experience in the Indian intelligence 
community, and as a long-time Gandhi family loyalist is seen 
as part of the traditional \"coterie\" around Congress Party 
President Sonia Gandhi. 
 
7.  (C) That said, the Indian media has been awash with the 
names of other NSA aspirants, many of whom possess far 
stronger foreign policy credentials than Narayanan.  This 
list includes (based on diplomatic and media gossip): 
-- Former Cabinet and Defense Secretary and Ambassador to 
Washington Naresh Chandra 
-- Gandhi family confidant and Ambassador to the US Ronen Sen 
-- Former High Commissioner to Pakistan and Rajiv Gandhi PMO 
veteran G Parthasarthy 
-- Former Foreign Secretary and recently-appointed Arunachal 
Pradesh Governor SK Singh 
-- Former Foreign Secretary and Indo-Pak Track II activist 
Salman Haidar 
-- Former Ambassador, Afghan Coordinator and National 
Security Advisory Board Convenor SK Lambah 
-- Former Ambassador to China Chandrashekhar Dasgupta 
-- Former Foreign Secretary MK Rasgotra 
-- Former Foreign Secretary K Ragunath 
-- Former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey 
-- Former Defense and Home Secretary and Kashmir Interlocutor 
NN Vohra 
-- Former Ambassador Lalit Mansingh 
 
The Indian press has been quick to handicap the \"contenders,\" 
many of whom have been promoting their own suitability.  For 
example, Sen arrived recently in Washington; Haider is 
considered too dovish for this post; and Lambah and Dasgupta 
are seen as political \"light-weights.\" 
 
He\'s No Dixit 
------------- 
 
8.  (C) Unlike Dixit and Mishra, Narayanan is not a former 
Foreign Service Officer, and has not served overseas in any 
capacity; he thus does not enjoy a network of loyalists 
within the MEA bureaucracy, a break with tradition if the NSA 
position becomes more inter-ministerial in nature.  Unlike 
Dixit, who served as MEA spokesman earlier in his career, 
Narayanan also has not cultivated the Delhi press corps. 
When Narayanan took the position of Special Adviser to the 
PM, he made it clear that he had no interest in challenging 
Dixit for his \"executive duties,\" and had no interest in the 
\"glamorous part of the (NSA) job,\" an attitude that may 
dovetail with whatever NSA/NSC restructuring emerges. 
 
Early Tests Likely 
------------------ 
 
9.  (C) If Narayanan continues as NSA, he will face an early 
test as both Intelligence Bureau head AK Doval and Research 
and Analysis Wing chief CD Sahay are due to retire on or 
about January 30.  The IB succession will probably be 
straightforward, but some Indian press accounts suggest that 
RAW officers are concerned that Narayanan, whose IB 
background makes him by definition and institutionally 
skeptical of RAW, would look outside the organization for 
Sahay\'s successor, and might bring in a senior IB officer for 
the job. 
 
10.  (C) Narayanan -- or whoever becomes NSA on a permanent 
basis -- will also have his hands full with other 
intelligence issues, not the least of which is the ongoing 
review of RAW operations that began with last spring\'s 
revelation that RAW Joint Secretary Rabinder Singh had been 
spiriting away classified information before he spirited 
himself out of the country.  Media reports of his supposed 
whereabouts surface from time to time, most recently 
suggesting he was spotted in Virginia in December.  If 
Narayanan does become NSA, long-serving RAW officers may try 
to obstruct reforms initiated by a former IB head. 
 
11.  (C) If he inherits Dixit\'s diplomatic role with 
Pakistan, China, and the US, Narayanan will suffer several 
disadvantages, the most important of which is a lack of 
practical negotiating experience.  As demonstrated in his 
effective dialogue with Tariq Aziz and with the US over NSSP, 
Dixit was one of India\'s most respected diplomatic 
practitioners -- well versed in the arts of listening, 
compromise, and working to a bottom line.  As a former 
Ambassador to all of India\'s neighbors, and an Urdu speaker 
as well, Dixit was uniquely equipped to manage India\'s 
regional relationships. 
 
An Intelligence Professional 
---------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Narayanan joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 
1955 and spent his first four years with the IPS in Tamil 
Nadu.  Calm, analytical, discreet, and cosmopolitan, he comes 
across as a classic intelligence analyst type.  It is not 
unusual for a conversation with Narayanan to consist largely 
of questions.  Although his writings have occasionally been 
critical of \"the West,\" he has not shown visceral anti-US 
attitudes.  His many years of service to the Gandhi family 
earned him his post as Special Advisor, where he serves as a 
behind-the-scenes coordinator for intelligence activity -- 
including India\'s Northeast and Nepal, areas of concern to 
New Delhi on a daily basis.  His position as Special Advisor 
carries with it the rank of Minister of State.  As Special 
Advisor, Narayanan was open, accessible, and friendly to 
Embassy officials, but usually in a listening mode. 
 
13.  (C) He became one of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\'s 
confidants after moving to the IB, India\'s primary internal 
intelligence service, in 1960.  Narayanan\'s experience in 
Tamil Nadu made him an effective figure in intelligence 
activities involving Sri Lankan Tamil issues after Rajiv 
Gandhi appointed him IB Director in 1987.  US Consulate 
General Chennai officials recall his repeatedly expressed and 
profound distaste for the LTTE.  He is also known as an 
expert on the Indian Left and communism. 
 
14.  (C) In 1990, Prime Minister VP Singh moved Narayanan 
from the IB to become Chairman of the Joint Intelligence 
Committee and Secretary of the National Security Council. 
Less than a year later, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, whose 
government was supported by the Congress Party, reappointed 
him as IB head, and Narayanan retired from that post in 1992. 
 After retirement, he served as Senior Advisor on National 
Security Affairs to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and as a 
member of Prime Minister Vajpayee\'s NSAB from 1998-2001.  He 
also served on two task forces on intelligence and internal 
security set up in the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil War. 
Narayanan is also a founding, but now inactive, member of the 
Center for Security Analysis, a Chennai-based think tank. 
15.  (C) Narayanan once related to CG/Chennai an anecdote 
from his days as Senior Advisor to PM Rao: Narayanan outlined 
how he had written a report and gave it to an aide to deliver 
to the PM.  After reading the report, the aide commented that 
he could not deliver such information, at which Narayanan 
said that he responded, \"I am not here to please, but rather 
to inform the PM.\" 
 
Need for \"Holistic Synergy\" on Kashmir, Pakistan 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
16.  (C) During his retirement years, Narayanan revealed 
particular interest in Pakistan and Kashmir through weekly 
columns he contributed to \"Asian Age\" (expanded excerpts 
reftel).  In them, he argued that only a small minority of 
Kashmiris supported the militancy, and most were angered that 
the 2002 elections did not lead to a drop in violence.  An 
\"early solution appears difficult,\" he wrote in January 2004, 
and in March he expanded that \"Neither \'cleverness\' nor 
\'shortcuts\' can help.  Creating a holistic synergy is 
necessary, (but) each side is more intent on blaming the 
other of being obstructive ... than in progressing the 
dialogue.  Neither side has been able to rise above narrow 
interpretations and preoccupations.\" 
 
Personal Data 
------------- 
 
17.  (C) Born on March 10, 1934 to a Kerala Nair 
(non-Brahmin, upper caste) family, Narayanan completed his 
bachelor\'s degree at Madras Christian College.  He and his 
wife Vijaya, also a Keralite, have a son, Vijay, and a 
daughter, Meena.  Their son-in-law Ajit Nambiar is Chairman 
and Managing Director of BPL Ltd, a consumer-durable 
manufacturing company, on whose board of directors Narayanan 
has served.  After retirement, Narayanan made Chennai his 
permanent home, and his wife remains there, as does his 
mother.  When he became Special Adviser to PM Singh, he often 
spent weekends in Chennai, which will probably cease if he 
becomes NSA on a permanent basis. 
 
18.  (C) According to a January 17 \"Outlook\" weekly profile 
by its foreign affairs correspondent V Sudarshan, Narayanan 
is a teetotaler and a fitness buff.  He also travels to 
Kerala every winter to visit the Hindu temple in Sabarimala, 
South India\'s largest pilgrimage site.  Narayanan has visited 
the US several times, and has delivered speeches and lectures 
in excellent English.  He is an honorary member of the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police, a rare 
distinction. 
 
19.  (C) Along with Principal Secretary TKA Nair, Narayanan 
constitutes what is now a Keralite \"mafia\" in the PMO.  In a 
bureaucratic culture dominated by North Indian Hindi 
speakers, this Keralite lock on the PM\'s inner bureaucratic 
circle represents something of an anomaly, which could in the 
long term create new faultlines around the Prime Minister.

SUBJECT: INDIA VERY CONFIDENT IT IS RIGHT ON BAGLIHAR DAM 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In a January 12 meeting with PolCouns, MEA 
Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K Singh 
was brimming with confidence that India was in the right on 
the Baglihar Dam issue.  If Pakistan went forward with 
arbitration, as it has suggested, India is ready, and will be 
vindicated, he stated.  New Delhi believes the dispute has 
little to do with water, and is primarily a political issue 
raised by Islamabad to prevent India from completing projects 
that benefit Kashmiris, as the hydroelectric project is 
designed to do.  Singh did not see the dispute as derailing 
the Composite Dialogue.  The World Bank tells us arbitration 
is terra incognita for them, suggesting that this case could 
easily continue for a long time, given the many 
hypotheticals.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) J/S Arun Singh was unusually confident about India\'s 
position on Baglihar in a January 12 conversation with 
PolCouns and Poloffs (other topics septels).  \"We have looked 
at the dam several times, and our technical and legal experts 
say it is treaty compliant,\" he stressed.  After the most 
recent round of discussions January 4-7 yielded no results, 
India had proposed fresh technical talks, on the grounds that 
they could lead to a further convergence of views.  MEA 
Spokesman Navtej Sarna told the press on January 11 that the 
GOI had provided volumes of data beyond treaty requirements, 
which \"should convince (Pakistan) that the technical 
parameters of the project do not violate Indus Waters Treaty 
provision.\"  Singh found it unfortunate that Islamabad seems 
prepared to go forward with arbitration, but predicted that 
\"they will be disappointed.\" 
 
3.  (C) Singh attributed the Pakistani position on 
arbitration to politics, which he saw as outweighing the 
technical issues.  Pakistan wants to prevent water projects 
in J&K, he continued, in order to block anything that 
benefits Kashmiris.  He asserted that the Baglihar Dam would 
have a major positive impact on electricity supplies in the 
state, which suffer from chronic power shortages.  This would 
have major political benefits for New Delhi, which it would 
not forego, especially after investing so much in the 
project.  The Pakistani position was a signal to Kashmiris 
that Islamabad has a veto on development in J&K, he stated, 
which India could not accept. 
 
4.  (C) Looking back historically, the Joint Secretary saw 
the Dam as analagous in some respects to the Wullar 
Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project, which the GOI delayed for 
several months as a favor to Benazir Bhutto, not as a treaty 
provision.  Once the GOI stopped it, he continued, Islamabad 
\"had what it wanted,\" and refused to engage substantively 
after that.  India will not make the same mistake again. 
Singh recalled that the Indus Waters Treaty had worked very 
well so far, and even held up during the 2002 Indo-Pak 
crisis, when the Baglihar Dam was also a bilateral problem. 
 
 
World Bank View 
--------------- 
 
5.  (C) In a January 12 conversation with D/Polcouns, a World 
Bank New Delhi official who is very familiar with the case 
observed that Pakistan is very serious about seeking 
arbitration because it sees the bilateral process as going 
nowhere.  The arbitration process would have to follow a 
strict series of steps, which could drag on for a year or 
longer, but inasmuch as the two sides have never gone this 
route in the past, it is terra incognita.  There are hundreds 
of hypotheticals that could influence the process, and no one 
could predict its course, he stated. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) We have rarely seen Arun Singh more confident on an 
issue than this one.  He was beyond comfortable, indicating 
clearly that the GOI has done its homework and is prepared 
for arbitration, should it come to that.  The MEA attitude 
that the dispute is \"not about water,\" however, but about 
Kashmir politics, is simplistic because whatever the merits 
of this case, water is a factor in Pakistan.  In contrast to 
Pakistan, where the dispute is reportedly regularly a front 
page item, in India the story is buried deeply in the papers, 
and has little public resonance. 
 
7.  (C) While it may be preferable for the case to be 
resolved bilaterally, several years of talks and much 
posturing on both sides have shown few results.  It is 
encouraging for Indo-Pak normalization that the parties have 
a neutral mechanism to decide the outcome, but the 
hypothetical World Bank timeline for arbitration suggests 
that the dispute could hang over the Composite Dialogue for 
quite some time, whether it has a direct effect on it or not. 
 Given the local World Bank office\'s lack of independent 
views on this looming dispute, Mission would appreciate 
Washington perspectives on the views of IBRD headquarters 
regarding process, timeline, and the status of the Baglihar 
project.

work to resolve the fewer than 20 remaining missing persons 
inquiries in India.  The USAID/DART team that conducted 
assessments in Andhra Pradesh has found that there is not an 
emergency need for shelter, food and water in the state.  The 
GOI has not yet been able to assemble a team of scientists to 
consider the need for a tsunami warning system for India, and 
SciCouns is working on the possibility of a US participant 
for the GOI\'s late January warning system brainstorming 
session.  New Delhi raised the number of tsunami-related 
Indian deaths by 345 in the last 24 hours amid criticism in 
local media of India\'s refusal to accept outside assistance. 
End Summary. 
 
Consular: Bringing Down the Numbers 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ConGen Chennai is working to clear the fewer than 20 
remaining open missing persons inquiries for India. 
 
USAID: Andhra Pradesh May Need Support For Livelihoods 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (U) On January 12 and 13, the USAID/DART team conducted 
assessments of coastal villages in southern Andhra Pradesh. 
The team reports that in Andhra Pradesh, shelter, food, water 
and sanitation are not emergency needs, but some livelihoods 
support may be required.  It is still unclear whether NGOs 
will be permitted to operate in the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands.  There is little available land for resettlement in 
the Islands, and displaced residents will likely need to 
remain in camps until a survey of habitable land is completed 
and resettlement areas are determined. 
 
Tsunami Warning System for India? 
 
SIPDIS 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The sensationalist \"Asian Age,\" in a January 13 
report, highlighted that Science and Technology Minister 
Kapil Sibal continues to promise a tsunami warning system for 
India.  Meanwhile, India is struggling to assemble a group of 
scientists to advise the GOI on what tsunami warning systems 
are like, and what are the benefits likely to accrue to India 
from such a system (reftel).  SciCouns has been in touch with 
NOAA and the NSF regarding possible US participants to the 
January 21-22 Tsunami Warning System Brainstorming Session 
the Department of Science and Technology is calling in New 
Delhi. 
 
\"Tsunami Diplomacy:\" Continued 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (U) Despite the generally positive take on India\'s 
handling of the disaster at home and in neighboring 
countries, some observers have raised questions about the 
wisdom of New Delhi\'s refusal of outside help.  A January 12 
editorial in the \"Indian Express\" criticized the GOI\'s 
decision to disallow Kofi Annan\'s visit as demonstrating 
\"indifferent diplomacy\" and \"misplaced hypersensitivity\" to 
offers of assistance.  A \"Tribune\" op-ed from the same day 
called India\'s position illogical, noting that \"India, more 
so its government, suffers from a silly notion about 
nationalism.\"  Highlighting the GOI\'s \"hypocritical stand,\" 
the piece noted that NGOs operating in India receive a large 
amount of foreign funding.  Novelist Amitav Ghosh, in his 
three-part article published in the \"Hindu,\" remarked that 
Indians waiting for days for help in the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands took little consolation in radio reports that New 
Delhi\'s rapid deployment of assistance to Sri Lanka would 
establish India as a superpower. 
 
Casualty Numbers 
---------------- 
 
6.  (U) Over the last 24 hours, the Ministry of Home Affairs 
(MHA) again revised the Indian dead and missing numbers 
upward.  On January 13, the MHA reported that 10,672 Indians 
had died as a result of the tsunami, an increase of 345 from 
January 12.  While the MHA has not yet declared the more than 
5,000 missing as presumed dead, the GOI lowered the figure by 
three to 5,625.
