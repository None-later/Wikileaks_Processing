SUBJECT: TFPM02: MEETING WITH SC PRESIDENT ON PANAMA 
 
REF: STATE 403831 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  AMB PICKERING MET WITH SC PRESIDENT 
(COLOMBIA) DEC 20 TO ASK THAT A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE 
REASONS FOR U.S. ACTIONS IN PANAMA AND A COPY OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT BE CIRCULATED AS OFFICIAL UN 
DOCUMENTS.  PICKERING ALSO ARGUED AGAINST PREMATURE 
ACTION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SUGGESTING THAT THE SC 
WAIT TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE OAS WOULD TAKE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  AMBS PICKERING AND WATSON, TOGETHER WITH POL AND 
LEGAL COUNSELORS, MET WITH SC PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENALOSA 
(COLOMBIA) MORNING DEC 20.  PICKERING DELIVERED TO 
PENALOSA COPIES OF PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT MADE 
7:20AM DEC 20 AND A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE REASONS FOR 
U.S. ACTION IN PANAMA.  HE ASKED THAT BOTH BE CIRCULATED 
AS OFFICIAL SC DOCUMENTS.  PENALOSA AGREED. 
 
4.  PENALOSA SAID HE NEEDED U.S. ADVICE REGARDING THE 
NICARAGUAN REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE MEETING OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL.  HIS OWN INCLINATION WOULD BE TO HOLD 
INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL AT 11:00AM, 
THEN FOLLOW WITH AN OPEN MEETING WHERE THE U.S., THE 
NICARAGUANS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES DELEGATIONS 
COULD MAKE STATEMENTS.  HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE 
COUNCIL TAKING ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION, BUT OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS THAT HE WOULD REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE 
MEMBERS, SEE HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS, AND DETERMINE 
IF A FURTHER MEETING AND ANY OTHER ACTION IS NECESSARY. 
PENALOSA ALSO SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE LATIN MEMBERS OF 
THE COUNCIL COULD PREPARE A PROPOSAL.  PICKERING 
INDICATED IT WAS PREMATURE TO CONSIDER SUCH AN APPROACH. 
 
5.  PICKERING STRESSED THAT IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE 
CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL SO EARLY.  A NUMBER 
OF QUESTIONS NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED.  HE SAID THE 
DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA HAD 
APPOINTED A NEW PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT HIS 
CREDENTIALS WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE SYG VERY SHORTLY. 
THE U.S. FEELS STRONGLY THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
NORIEGA REGIME SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE COUNCIL AND THAT 
THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA SHOULD BE SEATED. 
 
6.  PICKERING ALSO SAID THAT THE OAS WAS CONSIDERING THE 
ISSUE.  HE ARGUED THAT SINCE THE OAS IS THE REGIONAL 
FORUM FROM WHICH, UNDER ARTICLE 52 OF THE CHARTER, THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE ITS LEAD.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT PENALOSA MAY WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE 
COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR AT THE OAS IN ORDER TO LEARN FOR 
HIMSELF WHAT STEPS THE OAS WAS PLANNING TO TAKE. 
 
7.  PICKERING CONCLUDED BY SUGGESTING THAT PENALOSA 
CONSULT WITH INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL 
BILATERALLY AND SCHEDULE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE U.S. 
LATER IN THE DAY TO DISCUSS THE POSITIONS OF THE MEMBERS 
OF THE COUNCIL.  PICKERING EMPHASIZED THAT IT WOULD BE 
PREMATURE TO RUSH AHEAD WITH CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE 
THIS MORNING. 
 
8.  PICKERING NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SPOKEN BY 
TELEPHONE WITH PRESIDENT BARCO (WHO SAID HE WOULD TRY TO 
BE HELPFUL), PRIME MINISTERS MULRONEY AND THATCHER AND 
OTHER LEADERS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT PRELIMINARY REPORTS 
INDICATE THAT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE READY TO 
RECOGNIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. 
 
9.  COMMENT.  IN AN EFFORT TO DELAY SC CONSIDERATION OF 
THE ISSUE AND ALLOW THE PERMREP OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO PRESENT HIS CREDENTIALS, USUN 
IS ATTEMPTING TO PROLONG THE PERIOD OF BILATERAL 
CONSULTATIONS.  AT OUR REQUEST, THE UK, FRENCH, AND 
CANADIAN DELEGATIONS HAVE ALSO REQUESTED BILATERAL 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE SC PRESIDENT.  END COMMENT. 
 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

OF 14-0-0 WITH ONE MEMBER, YEMEN, NOT PARTICIPATING, A 
RESOLUTION (SC RES 660) CONDEMNING THE IRAQI INVASION OF 
KUWAIT.  THE ALL-NIGHT SC SESSION, CALLED BY THE U.S. 
AND KUWAIT, HEARD THE KUWAITI PERMREP EXPRESS SHOCK AND 
\"BITTERNESS\" OVER THE ATTACK BY A FELLOW ARAB COUNTRY 
AND THE IRAQI PERMREP DESCRIBE THE EVENTS IN KUWAIT AS 
AN INTERNAL MATTER WITH THE IRAQIS RESPONDING TO A 
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE \"FREE PROVISIONAL 
GOVERNMENT\" OF KUWAIT.  WITH THE U.S. IN THE LEAD, NINE 
SC MEMBERS SPOKE AT THE FORMAL MEETING TO EXPRESS 
OUTRAGE AT THE IRAQI USE OF FORCE, AND CALLED FOR THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF IRAQI TROOPS AND NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE 
THE DISPUTE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED BY A VOTE OF 14-0-0 
A RESOLUTION (SC RES 660) CONDEMNING THE IRAQI INVASION 
OF KUWAIT.  THE ONLY ARAB MEMBER OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL, YEMEN, DECLARED THAT IT WOULD NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE OR VOTE AS IT HAD NOT YET

AND NINE SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE 
DEBATE; EIGHT SC MEMBERS IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. 
CO-SPONSORED THE U.S. RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IRAQ, 
CALLING FOR A WITHDRAWAL OF IRAQI FORCES AND 
NEGOTIATIONS IN THE DISPUTE. 
 
3.  (U) THE TEXT OF SC RES 660 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, ALARMED BY THE INVASION OF KUWAIT 
ON 2 AUGUST 1990 BY THE MILITARY FORCES OF IRAQ, 
 
DETERMINING THAT THERE EXISTS A BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL 
PEACE AND SECURITY AS REGARDS THE IRAQI INVASION OF 
KUWAIT, 
 
ACTING UNDER ARTICLES 39 AND 40 OF THE CHARTER OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS, 
 
1.  CONDEMNS THE IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT; 
 
2.  DEMANDS THAT IRAQ WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY ALL ITS FORCES TO THE POSITIONS IN WHICH 
THEY WERE LOCATED ON 1 AUGUST 1990;

DIFFERENCES AND SUPPORTS ALL EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD, AND 
ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE ARAB LEAGUE: 
 
4.  DECIDES TO MEET AGAIN AS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER 
FURTHER STEPS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS RESOLUTION. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
4.  (U) IN THE EARLY MORNING FORMAL SESSION OF THE SC, 
THE KUWAITI PERMREP SPOKE FIRST, EXPRESSING HIS 
\"BITTERNESS AND EMBARRASSMENT\" TO BE IN THE POSITION OF 
HAVING BEEN ATTACKED BY A \"PREVIOUSLY FRIENDLY COUNTRY\" 
WHICH HAD IN THE PAST BEEN PRAISED FOR ITS ASSISTANCE IN 
THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN THE REGION.  HE 
STATED THAT BAGHDAD RADIO HAD ANNOUNCED THE GOAL OF THE 
INVASION AS A COUP DETAT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT IN KUWAIT 
OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD BE FRIENDLY TOWARD IRAQ.  THE 
KUWAITI PERMREP CONTINUED THAT AMIR OF KUWAIT AND HEAD 
OF GOVERNMENT WERE IN CONTROL.  HE URGED THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL TO CONDEMN THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE UN 
CHARTER AND ASK FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL OF 
IRAQI FORCES. 
 
5.  (U)  THE IRAQI PERMREP FOLLOWED WITH A STATEMENT 
THAT \"THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN KUWAIT RELATED TO A 
PURELY INTERNAL MATTER.\"  HE SAID THAT THE \"FREE 
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT\" OF KUWAIT HAD REQUESTED IRAQI 
ASSISTANCE TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND THAT IRAQ WANTED 
ONLY GOOD RELATIONS WITH KUWAIT AND WOULD WITHDRAW ITS 
FORCES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  DECLARING THAT \"THOSE 
SITTING IN THE CHAIR ARE NOT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT,\" 
THE IRAQI PERMREP SAID THAT U.S. SPONSORSHIP OF THE 
RESOLUTION BEFORE THE SC PROVED THAT THE UNITED STATES 
WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE \"PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF 
KUWAIT\". 
 
6.  (U) AMBASSADOR PICKERING LED OFF THE DEBATE WITH A 
STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE IRAQI INVASION, WHICH WAS A 
CLEAR INSTANCE OF AGGRESSION, AND MAKING CLEAR THAT THE 
UNITED STATES WAS STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH 
KUWAIT.  PICKERING APPEALED TO THE COUNCIL TO ACCEPT ITS 
FULL RESPONSIBILITIES, NEITHER VACILLATE NOR 
PROCRASTINATE AND ADOPT IMMEDIATELY THE DRAFT 
RESOLUTION.  THE FULL TEXT OF PICKERING\'S STATEMENT IS 
AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT. 
 
STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
 
AT ABOUT 6:30PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR SHORTLY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT IN KUWAIT AND IRAQ, IRAQI FORCES MOVED 
INTO KUWAIT TERRITORY, ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED 
FROM THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN KUWAIT.  THESE MILITARY 
FORCES CROSSED OVER INTO KUWAITI TERRITORY ALL ALONG THE 
FRONTIER ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS.  THE FORCES RAPIDLY 
PROCEEDED TO KUWAIT CITY AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT 
IN THAT CITY. 
 
THERE WAS OPPOSITION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THESE MILITARY 
FORCES, FIRING, AND COMBAT.  WE ARE NOT AWARE YET OF THE 
EXTENT OF CASUALTIES, BUT WE ARE INFORMED THAT KUWAITI 
FORCES ARE RESISTING THE ADVANCE OF THE IRAQIS. 
 
WHILE THE IRAQI INVASION WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED AND 
PROFESSIONALLY EXECUTED, THE IRAQIS AT ONE POINT MADE A 
SERIOUS MISTAKE.  INSTEAD OF STAGING A COUP D\'ETAT AND 
INSTALLING THE SO CALLED FREE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT 
BEFORE THE INVASION THEY GOT IT THE WRONG WAY AROUND. 
THEY INVADED KUWAIT AND THEN STAGED THE COUP D\'ETAT IN A 
BLATANT AND DECEITFUL EFFORT TO TRY TO JUSTIFY THEIR 
ACTION. 
 
IT IS WITH GREAT HAPPINESS THAT I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT 
THE AMIR, CROWN PRINCE AND FOREIGN MINISTER ARE SAFE AND 
DIRECTING THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ISSUED 
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: 
 
\"THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE IRAQI MILITARY 
INVASION OF KUWAIT AND CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE AND 
UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL OF ALL IRAQI FORCES.  WE HAVE 
CONVEYED THIS MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR IN 
WASHINGTON AND TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THROUGH OUR 
EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD.  WE DEPLORE THIS BLATANT USE OF 
MILITARY AGGRESSION AND VIOLATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
CHARTER.  TOGETHER WITH KUWAIT, WE ARE CALLING FOR AN 
EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY 
COUNCIL.\" 
 
THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE CLEAR THAT IT WILL STAND 
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH KUWAIT IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. 
 
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESENT AGGRESSION WAS 
COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED.  THE UNITED STATES POLICY HAS 
BEEN TO SUPPORT EVERY DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE 
PRESENT CRISIS.  THUS WE DID NOT ARRIVE LIGHTLY AT OUR 
POSITION OF CALLING FOR A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING OR 
SEEKING AN IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD CONDEMN THE 
IRAQI INVASION, CALL FOR THE IMMEDIATE UNCONDITIONAL 
WITHDRAWAL OF IRAQI TROOPS, AND SUPPORT A PROCESS OF 
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IRAQ AND 
KUWAIT AND PARTICULARLY THE EFFORTS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY 
THE ARAB LEAGUE IN THIS REGARD. 
 
WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH MANY STATES IN THE REGION IN 
AN EFFORT TO SEEK THEIR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
ACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRING ABOUT AN 
END TO THIS HEINOUS ACT OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE 
CONTRARY TO THE CHARTER, INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND ALL THE 
FULLY ACCEPTED FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR. 
 
THE COUNCIL HAS SELDOM FACED A MORE BLATANT USE OF 
FORCE.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD ACT IMMEDIATELY IN DEALING 
WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE UNITED STATES, PLEASED TO JOIN 
WITH EIGHT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, IS PROPOSING A 
DRAFT RESOLUTION TEXT FOR IMMEDIATE ADOPTION BY THE 
COUNCIL.  THE COUNCIL CERTAINLY CAN DO NO LESS IN THIS 
TIME OF PRESENT CRISIS THAN TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY AND 
RAPIDLY WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM. 
 
WE ASK THE COUNCIL TO ACCEPT ITS FULL RESPONSIBILITIES 
AND TO SUPPORT KUWAIT IN ITS HOUR OF NEED.  IT IS TIME 
FOR PEACE AND DIPLOMACY, NOT THE TIME FOR WAR AND 
AGGRESSION.  THE WORLD IS NOW WATCHING WHAT WE DO HERE 
AND WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH VACILLATION AND 
PROCRASTINATION. 
 
IN THIS TIME OF MOST SERIOUS CRISIS, I ASK ALL THE 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL CAREFULLY TO CONTEMPLATE 
THE IMMENSE ISSUES BEFORE US AND TO ACT IN THE WAY IN 
WHICH THEY AS MEMBERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION, AND STATES 
COMMITTED TO ACT UNDER THE CHARTER, SHOULD ACT. 
 
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
7.  (U)  SEVEN OTHER SC MEMBERS SPOKE IN THE DEBATE. 
COLOMBIA INDICATED THAT IT WAS SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION 
FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT IT SUPPORTED THE RESOLUTION 
CONDEMNING THE INVASION OF PANAMA IN DECEMBER, MAINLY 
ITS HISTORICAL OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FORCE.  CANADA 
CONDEMNED THE \"BRUTAL IRAQI AGGRESSION\" AND URGED THAT 
THE \"INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE BE CLEAR AND VIGOROUS.\" 
FRANCE \"UNRESERVEDLY CONDEMNED THE INVASION\" WHILE 
MALAYSIA STATED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF NON-AGGRESSION IN 
THE CHARTER WERE \"SACROSANCT\".  THE U.K. PERMREP, 
REMARKING ON THIS \"UGLY MOMENT IN WORLD AFFAIRS\", SAID 
THE \"FULL-SCALE INVASION OF A SMALL AND VULNERABLE 
NEIGHBOR BY IRAQ WAS A BREACH OF THE CHARTERS OF BOTH 
THE UN AND THE ARAB LEAGUE.\"  HE WENT ON TO CONDEMN THE 
\"PHONY COUP D\'ETAT, INVASION AND PUPPET GOVERNMENT\" AND 
URGED THE SC TO PROTECT \"THE SMALL, VULNERABLE AND 
DEFENSELESS.\"  FINLAND, THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA AND 
ROMANIA ADDED THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN AND 
CONDEMNATIONS OF THE IRAQI INVASION. 
 
8.  (C)  THE SESSION WAS DELAYED BY THE INDECISION OF 
YEMEN REGARDING ITS VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION.  THE NAM 
CAUCUSED SEVERAL TIMES AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO SUPPORT 
THE RESOLUTION, LEAVING YEMEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF 
ABSTAINING.  IN THE EVENT, YEMEN CHOSE NOT TO ABSTAIN, 
BUT RATHER NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE AND VOTE. 
THE YEMENI PERMREP EXPLAINED THIS DECISION BY HIS LACK 
OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIS CAPITAL, BUT EXPRESSED HIS 
SORROW AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT THE ISSUE INVOLVED TWO 
ARAB COUNTRIES, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE ARAB LEAGUE, AND HE 
ASSERTED THE NEED FOR STATES TO RESPECT EACH OTHER\'S 
SOVEREIGNTY AND AVOID THE USE OF FORCE. 
 
9.  (C)  THE U.S. WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN EIGHT CO-SPONSORS 
OF THE RESOLUTION:  CANADA, COLOMBIA, COTE D\'IVOIRE, 
ETHIOPIA, FINLAND, FRANCE, MALAYSIA, AND THE U.K.  USUN 
WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE KUWAITI MISSION INFORMED OF 
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND.

SUBJECT: IRAQ DECIDES NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN UN BOUNDARY 
- DEMARCATION COMMISSION SESSION 
 
REF: USUN 2977 
 
1. FOR THE RECORD WE PROVIDE THE FULL TEXT OF THE IRAQI 
FM\'S JULY 12 LETTER (S/24275, FAXED TO IO/UNP), 
SUMMARIZED REFTEL, IN WHICH IRAQ ANNOUNCES THAT IT WILL 
NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT SESSION OF THE UN 
BOUNDARY DEMARCATION COMMISSION IN NEW YORK. 
 
2. BEGIN TEXT: 
LETTER DATED 12 JULY 1992 FROM THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS OF IRAQ ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INFORM YOU THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
NOTIFIED THAT THE BOUNDARY DEMARCATION COMMISSION HAS 
DECIDED TO HOLD ITS SIXTH SESSION AT NEW YORK BETWEEN 15 
AND 24 JULY 1992. ON THIS OCCASION, I SHOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE LETTER 
THAT I ADDRESSED TO YOU ON 21 MAY 1992 CONCERNING THE 
DECISIONS ADOPTED ON 14 APRIL 1992, AT ITS FIFTH 
SESSION, BY THE COMMISSION YOU APPOINTED ON THE MATTER 
OF THE BOUNDARY (S/24044, ANNEX). IN THAT LETTER, I SET 
FORTH IN DETAIL THE VIEWPOINT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ 
ON THIS GRAVE MATTER IN VIEW OF ITS VITAL IMPORTANCE TO 
THE INTERESTS OF IRAQ AND OF OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD 
THAT EXPERIENCE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES REGARDING 
BOUNDARIES. IN THAT LETTER, I ELUCIDATED HOW THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL HAD, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MANNER, 
INTRUDED THE ISSUE OF THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN IRAQ AND 
KUWAIT INTO ITS RESOLUTION 687 (1991) BY IMPOSING ON IT 
A PARTICULAR STATUS, WHILE IT IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED IN 
LAW AND IN PRACTICE AS THEY RELATE TO INTERNATIONAL 
INTERCOURSE THAT BOUNDARY ISSUES ARE LEFT TO AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN STATES BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY BASIS CAPABLE OF 
ENSURING THE PRINCIPLE OF BOUNDARY STABILITY. I ALSO 
EXPLAINED HOW CERTAIN VERY VITAL ASPECTS OF THE 
ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE ENJOINED 
BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH REGARD TO SO-CALLED 
BOUNDARY DEMARCATION DID NOT ENSURE JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS 
BY STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE POSITIONS OF THE TWO 
PARTIES AND MAINTAINING THEIR EQUALITY. THOSE ASPECTS 
INCLUDED THE WAY THE DEMARCATION COMMISSION WAS FORMED, 
THE MANNER IN WHICH IT UNDERTOOK ITS TECHNICAL WORK, THE 
MANNER IN WHICH IT TOOK DECISIONS, THE NATURE AND 
PURPOSE OF THOSE DECISIONS AND OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS. 
AS YOU KNOW, IN MY LETTER I ADDRESSED IN DETAIL ONE 
EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMMISSION REACHED A 
MAJOR DECISION ON A MATTER OF SUBSTANCE CONCERNING THE 
GENERAL COURSE OF THE BOUNDARY LINE ON THE BASIS OF A 
CARTOGRAPHIC VIEWPOINT THAT RELIED FUNDAMENTALLY ON 
BRITISH CORRESPONDENCE AND MAPS GOING BACK TO THE PERIOD 
WHEN BRITAIN WAS THE COLONIAL POWER DOMINATING THE 
REGION. IN THIS CONNECTION, I STATED ALSO HOW THE 
COMMISSION HAD ADOPTED THIS APPROACH AS A GENERAL ONE 
AND THAT, INSTEAD OF EXERCISING PATIENCE IN REACHING 
DECISIONS AND AWAITING THE PRESENTATION OF THE DOCUMENTS 
AND NOTES REFERRED TO BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ, IT 
PREVENTED THAT FROM TAKING PLACE BY ADOPTING SUBSTANTIVE 
AND TECHNICAL DECISIONS WITH NOTABLE HASTE AND DISPATCH 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EVIDENT PRESSURE FROM THE 
 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME OF KUWAIT. THE DECISIONS 
WERE THE OUTCOME OF ANSWERS TO LEADING QUESTIONS 
ADDRESSED TO THE TWO EXPERTS WHICH LED TO PROPOSALS 
MERELY FOR THE ANSWER ELICITED WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE 
PROPER LOGIC OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND THE 
INTERRELATED CHARACTER OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ISSUES 
ADDRESSED. THE COMMISSION THUS ENDED UP ADOPTING 
DECISIONS THAT WERE ONE-SIDED IN RESPECT OF SOURCE AND 
CONTENT. 
 
AS YOU KNOW, I CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE 
COMMISSION HAD ACCORDED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME 
OF KUWAIT THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF THE 
DEMARCATION OF THE MARITIME BOUNDARY IN THE KHOR 
ABDULLAH DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION\'S MANDATE 
DID NOT EXTEND TO THAT MATTER, IN THE VIEW OF THE TWO 
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS AS SUPPORTED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COMMISSION, IN AN OBVIOUS ENDEAVOUR TO SECURE THE 
DESIRES OF THE RULERS OF KUWAIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE 
HISTORIC RIGHTS OF IRAQ AND ITS VITAL NAVIGATIONAL 
INTERESTS. 
 
I ALSO MADE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT THE ACTUAL REALITY OF 
THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD IS UNEQUIVOCAL 
TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION OF THE 
COMMISSION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER INCOMPATIBLE WITH 
ITS OWN TENOR BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGIME OF 
KUWAIT AND HIS EXPERTS PARTICIPATING IN THE WORK ON THE 
GROUND AND THAT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION HAS NOT BEEN 
SAFE FROM DIRECT INTERVENTION BY THE SECRETARIAT. THUS, 
THE FINAL OUTCOME OF ALL THIS ACTIVITY IS THE ESSENTIAL 
FACT THAT THE MATTER OF DEALING WITH BOUNDARIES WAS 
JUSTIFIED AND SET IN MOTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH A 
PREDETERMINED COURSE SO AS TO CULMINATE IN DECISIONS 
IMPOSED ON IRAQ WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR ITS INTERESTS AND 
ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THEM AND LEAVING NO SCOPE 
FOR JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS TO IRAQ\'S TERRITORIAL INTERESTS 
WE STILL BELIEVE, AS I INDICATED IN MY LETTER, THAT THE 
OUTCOME OF THE COMMISSION\'S WORK IS A PURELY POLITICAL 
DECISION IMPOSED BY THE POWERS THAT TODAY CONTROL THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE UNITED NATIONS, IN PARTICULAR 
THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED 
KINGDOM. THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVE OF THE DECISION IS 
CLEAR, AND IT IS NOT ONLY TO DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS RIGHTS 
AND DAMAGE ITS VITAL INTERESTS BUT ALSO DELIBERATELY TO 
CREATE A PRESENCE OF AMERICAN AND BRITISH ARMED FORCES 
AND MILITARY BASES SO THAT THEY MAY CONTINUE TO 
BLACKMAIL THE EXISTING REGIMES AND TO PLUNDER OIL 
RESOURCES. 
AFTER PROLONGED STUDY OF ALL THE FACTORS AND 
CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT THE VIEWS OF IRAQ 
WILL NOT BE HEARD IN THE COMMISSION AND THAT IT WILL NOT 
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING REGARDLESS OF ANY 
EFFORTS WE MAKE TO CREATE AN OBJECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL 
ATMOSPHERE FOR ITS WORK. THIS IS BECAUSE A PRIOR AND 
BIASED DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO HARM IRAQ\'S INTERESTS 
AND DENY ITS HISTORIC RIGHTS ON THE PART OF THOSE 
COUNTRIES THAT PLANNED THE COMMISSION\'S WORK. AMONG THE 
SALIENT FACTS THAT CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION IS THAT THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL WAS INFORMED OF THE LETTER WHICH WE 
ADDRESSED TO YOU, AND INSTEAD OF ITS TENOR PROVIDING AN 
INCENTIVE TO CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND FAIR 
INVESTIGATION, THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED 
RESORTED TO INDUCING THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT A STATEMENT BY 
ITS PRESIDENT WHICH CONTAINED ONLY INTERPRETATIONS 
LACKING IN OBJECTIVITY AND THREATS. 
FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE FEEL THAT OUR 
PARTICIPATION IN THE MEETING OF THE COMMISSION WOULD BE 
TO NO AVAIL. 
(SIGNED) AHMAD HUSSEIN 
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ

SUBJECT:  TFSOOL - UN WOULD LIKE TO CONSULT WITH US ON 
TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS TO \"OPERATION RESTORE HOPE\" 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL: ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY: IN DECEMBER 7 MEETINGS WITH AMBASSADOR 
PERKINS, THE SYG AND USG GOULDING ASKED THE US TO 
CONSULT WITH THE UN ON TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS BEFORE MAKING 
FINAL DECISIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN SUCCESSIVE MEETINGS DECEMBER 7 BOUTROS GHALI AND 
USG GOULDING URGED US CONSULTATION WITH THE UN PRIOR TO 
FINALIZING DECISIONS FOR TROOP CONTRIBUTORS TO 
\"OPERATION RESTORE HOPE\".  B-G EXPLAINED THAT WHILE THE 
UN HAD NO DESIRE TO SECOND GUESS US JUDGMENTS, THE UN 
HAD BOTH SYMBOLIC AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS TO CONSIDER. 
 
4.  FIRST, THE UN WANTED TO AVOID THE IMPRESSION THAT IT 
WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE LOOP ON A UN AUTHORIZED 
OPERATION, SO SOME KIND OF VISIBLE LINK WOULD REINFORCE 
THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION.  SECONDLY, IT WAS LIKELY 
THAT SOME UNIFIED COMMAND CONTINGENTS WOULD BE ASKED TO 
STAY ON FOR SERVICE IN A REVIVED UNOSOM.  THE UN WANTS 
TO BE SURE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE UNITS CHOSEN WOULD 
BE SUITABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE 
TO OFFER ITS THOUGHTS TO THE US BEFORE OUR DECISIONS ARE 
A FAIT ACCOMPLI.  FROM THE UN\'S PERSPECTIVE, B-G 
LAMENTED, A FURTHER FACTOR WAS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE 
US APPEAL FOR PARTICIPATION IN \"OPERATION RESTORE HOPE\" 
WOULD SIPHON OFF TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOULD 
OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THE LARGE UPCOMING 
MOZAMBIQUE OPERATION AS WELL AS THE OBSERVER MISSIONS IN 
ANGOLA AND SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
5.  AMBASSADOR PERKINS SAID THAT A CONSTANT PUBLIC 
IMPRESSION OF \"HONEST COLLABORATION\" WAS IMPORTANT TO 
MAINTAIN.  THE PROPOSED CONSULTATION WOULD BE DESIRABLE 
FOR BOTH SIDES AND COULD OCCUR VIA REGULAR MEETINGS 
BETWEEN THE UN AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JOINT 
CHIEFS.  THESE COULD ALSO PROVIDE THE CONTENT FOR 
REGULAR REPORTS BY THE SYG TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  IN 
A MEETING WITH USG GOULDING AND PERKINS LATER IN THE 
DAY, JCS REP ARNOLD AGREED TO TRY TO ARRANGE FOR A FULL 
UPDATE ON TROOP CONTRIBUTION OFFERS DECEMBER 9, WHEN 
ADMIRAL BOWMAN AND AMBASSADOR GROVE WILL VISIT UN 
HEADQUARTERS FOR CONSULTATIONS.

PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) DURING MAY 28 SECURITY COUNCIL INFORMAL 
CONSULTATIONS, THE SWEDISH, COSTA RICAN, JAPANESE, 
BRAZILIAN AND OTHER DELEGATIONS RAISED THE PAKISTANI 
NUCLEAR TESTS.  THEY SAID THE PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR 
CAPABILITIES BY INDIA AND PAKISTAN WAS A THREAT TO 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND CALLED ON THE COUNCIL 
PRESIDENT TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS \"AT A 
MINIMUM.\"  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON AND RUSSIAN PERMREP 
LAVROV AGREED.  THE COUNCIL MUST ACT QUICKLY, HE SAID, 
BUT THE REACTION SHOULD BE A BALANCED, CAREFUL ONE.  HE 
RECOMMENDED A PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ALONG THE LINES OF 
THE ONE CONCERNING INDIA, ISSUED MAY 14.  HE CIRCULATED 
A DRAFT STATEMENT WORKED OUT WITH THE U.S. DELEGATION. 
THE DRAFT TEXT IS BASED ON THE 14 MAY STATEMENT AND THE 
TEXT OF A SUBSEQUENT U.S./RUSSIAN DRAFT (WHICH HAD NOT 
BEEN INTRODUCED) THAT CALLS FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN INDIA 
AND PAKISTAN.  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON SUPPORTED 
IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT. 
 
CALLS FOR MORE-ENCOMPASSING COUNCIL ACTION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) AMBASSADOR OWADA (JAPAN) SAID THAT IN ADDITION 
TO ACTION ON THE PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST, THE COUNCIL 
SHOULD ADDRESS THE COMBINED EFFECT OF BOTH INDIA\'S AND 
PAKISTAN\'S NUCLEAR EFFORTS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL -- 
AND THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- MUST NOW 
BEGIN TO LOOK AT NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES IN A NEW 
WAY.  THE COUNCIL MUST BEGIN CONSIDERATION OF A 
RESOLUTION THAT CONVEYS THIS BROADER VIEW. 
 
4. (C) AMBASSADOR DAHLGREN (SWEDEN AGREED WITH NEED 
FOR URGENT COUNCIL ACTION.  HE SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTIONS 
TO PUSH FOR A SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION. 
 
(SWEDISH/JAPANESE DRAFT RESOLUTION FAXED TO IO/UNP.) 
 
RICHARDSON CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON SAID THAT PAKISTAN\'S 
DECISION TO DETONATE A NUCLEAR DEVICE WAS A \"LOST 
OPPORTUNITY.\"  HE RECOUNTED INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. 
EFFORTS TO AVOID THE PRESENT CRISIS.  WHAT WAS NEEDED 
NOW WAS RAPID, CONCRETE ACTION.  INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
MUST SIGN THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY, BEGIN A 
DIALOGUE, AND REVERSE THE ARMS RACE THEY STARTED.  IN 
THE MEANTIME, THE COUNCIL NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THE 
PAKISTANI TEST TODAY. 
 
6.  (C)  ONLY THE CHINESE RESISTED.  IN A MORNING 
MEETING OF EXPERTS, THEY ATTEMPTED TO MODIFY THE 
LANGUAGE TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD THE 
INDIANS.  NO DELEGATION ACCEPTED THEIR PROPOSALS.  IN 
AFTERNOON CONSULTATIONS, THEY AGAIN ARGUED THAT THEY 
WOULD HAVE TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS FROM BEIJING.  IN A 
SUBSEQUENT P-5 MEETING, THE CHINESE AGREED AD REF TO A 
TEXT.  THE COUNCIL CONVENED AT LO:30 P.M. TO APPROVE 
IT, BUT THE CHINESE SAID THAT, IN SPITE OF HAVING MADE 
A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION TO BEIJING, THEY STILL HAD NO 
INSTRUCTIONS TO AGREE.  THEY MADE NO SUBSTANTIVE 
OBJECTIONS.  THE COUNCIL WILL RECONVENE MAY 29 A.M. 
(TEXT AT PARA 11 BELOW.) 
 
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY GENERAL 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  (U)  BEGIN SYG\'S STATEMENT: 
 
I DEPLORE BOTH THE INDIAN AND PAKISTANI TESTS.  THEY 
EXACERBATE TENSION IN AN ALREADY DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP. 
 
I CALL ON BOTH GOVERNMENTS TO SIGN THE COMPREHENSIVE 
TEST BAN TREATY.  THEY MIGHT ALSO SIGN A NO-FIRST-USE 
PLEDGE WITH EACH OTHER. 
 
FINALLY, BOTH NATIONS SHOULD FREEZE THEIR NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS SHOULD DECREASE, NOT INCREASE. 
 
AS WE APPROACH THE NEW CENTURY, WE SHOULD BE ASKING HOW 
BEST TO PRESERVE LIFE, CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION, NOT 
HOW TO BECOME MORE DESTRUCTIVE. 
 
END SYG STATEMENT.

9.  (U)  THE LATEST DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT TEXT 
FOLLOWS:: 
 
BEGIN DRAFT STATEMENT: 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL STRONGLY DEPLORES THE UNDERGROUND 
NUCLEAR TESTS THAT PAKISTAN CONDUCTED ON 28 MAY 1998, 
DESPITE OVERWHELMING INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AND CALLS 
FOR RESTRAINT.  REAFFIRMING ITS 14 MAY PRESIDENTIAL 
STATEMENT (S/PRST/12) ON THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TESTS OF 11 
AND 13 MAY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL STRONGLY URGES INDIA 
AND PAKISTAN TO REFRAIN FROM ANY FURTHER TESTS.  IT IS 
OF THE VIEW THAT TESTING BY INDIA AND THEN BY PAKISTAN 
IS CONTRARY TO THE DE FACTO MORATORIUM ON THE TESTING 
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR OTHER NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, 
AND TO GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARDS NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION 
AND NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.  THE COUNCIL ALSO EXPRESSES 
ITS CONCERN AT THE EFFECTS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON PEACE 
AND STABILITY IN THE REGION. 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL REAFFIRMS THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE 
OF THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION ON NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS (NPT) AND THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY 
(CTBT).  THE COUNCIL APPEALS TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN, AND 
ALL OTHER STATES WHICH HAVE NOT YET DONE SO, TO BECOME 
PARTIES TO THE NPT, AND TO THE CTBT, WITHOUT DELAY AND 
WITHOUT CONDITIONS.  THE COUNCIL ALSO ENCOURAGES INDIA 
AND PAKISTAN TO PARTICIPATE, IN A POSITIVE SPIRIT, IN 
THE PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER STATES FOR A 
FISSILE MATERIAL CUT-OFF TREATY IN GENEVA WITH A VIEW 
TO REACHING EARLY AGREEMENT. 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS UPON ALL PARTIES TO EXERCISE 
MAXIMUM RESTRAINT AND TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO REDUCE 
AND REMOVE TENSIONS BETWEEN THEM.  THE COUNCIL 
REAFFIRMS THAT THE SOURCES OF TENSION IN SOUTH ASIA 
SHOULD BE REDUCED AND ELIMINATED ONLY THROUGH PEACEFUL 
DIALOGUE AND NOT BY THE USE OF FORCE OR OTHER MILITARY 
MEANS. 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL URGES INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO RESUME 
THEIR DIALOGUE ON ALL OUTSTANDING BILATERAL ISSUES, 
INCLUDING ALL THOSE THAT THE PARTIES HAVE ALREADY 
DISCUSSED, IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THEM 
AND TO ENHANCE THEIR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
COOPERATION.  THE COUNCIL CALLS UPON INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
TO AVOID ANY STEPS OR STATEMENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO 
FURTHER INSTABILITY OR IMPEDE THEIR BILATERAL DIALOGUE. 
 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER. 
 
END DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT.

--  COMING SO CLOSE AFTER THE ADOPTION OF A

REGARDING THE FIRST SET OF NUCLEAR TESTS CONDUCTED ON 
28 MAY, THESE NEW TESTS WERE AGAIN DEEPLY DEPLORED BY

CONDITIONS.

REF:   A) STATE 154714     B) STATE 154715 
 
CLASSIFIED BY MARK MINTON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR; 
REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) ON AUGUST 24, COUNCIL PRESIDENT TURK (SLOVENIA) 
NOTED RECEIPT OF A LETTER FROM SUDANESE MINISTER FOR 
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS RORIC CONDEMNING THE AUGUST 20 
DESTRUCTION OF THE EL-SHIFA PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY BY 
U.S. MISSILES (REF A).  AMBASSADOR BURLEIGH EXPLAINED 
TO COUNCIL MEMBERS THE JUSTIFICATIONS UNDERLYING 
AMERICAN USE OF FORCE AGAINST THE SUDANESE FACILITY 
(SEE PARA 2 - TEXT OF BURLEIGH STATEMENT).  BAHRAIN 
PERMREP BUALLAY CONDEMNED ALL ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE RECENT BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND 
DAR ES SALAAM, SAYING SUCH COWARDLY AGGRESSION ONLY 
SERVED TO UNDERMINE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS AS WELL AS CAUSE NEEDLESS SUFFERING 
AMONG INNOCENT CIVILIANS.  BUALLAY NOTED THAT SINCE ALL 
THE DETAILS OF THE AUGUST 20 ATTACK ON THE SUDANESE 
FACTORY WERE NOT KNOWN, THE COUNCIL SHOULD SEEK 
ADDITIONAL TIME FOR REFLECTION AND FURTHER STUDY BEFORE 
ADVOCATING SPECIFIC ACTION.  BUALLAY ALSO CALLED FOR AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO COORDINATE POLICY AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  THERE WERE NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL 
MEMBERS. 
 
2.  (C) TEXT OF STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR BURLEIGH CONCERNING 
U.S. ACTIONS ON AUGUST 20: 
 
BEGIN TEXT. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK BY NOW ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
COUNCIL HAVE READ THE LETTER WE ASKED TO HAVE 
CIRCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 51 OF THE UN 
CHARTER REPORTING THAT WE HAVE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT OF 
SELF DEFENSE IN RESPONDING TO TERRORIST ATTACKS AND 
CONTINUING THREATS AGAINST OUR EMBASSIES AND CITIZENS 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
 
AS A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, I JUST WANTED TO ELABORATE A 
LITTLE MORE INFORMALLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST FRIDAY, 
SO YOU ALL CAN HEAR IT FROM US, FIRST HAND, AND NOT 
FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE. 
 
THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO LAUNCH THESE STRIKES BASED ON 
CREDIBLE AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE, ACCUMULATED OVER A 
PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS, THAT THE TARGETED FACILITIES, 
AND THE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THEM, POSED A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE 
SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS. 
 
THE THREE TERRORIST BASES AT KHOST, AFGHANISTAN 
PROVIDED A REFUGE FOR TERRORISTS AND WAS A CENTER FOR 
THEIR FUNDING, TRAINING AND TRAVEL. 
 
IN ADDITION TO THE AUGUST 7 BOMBINGS OF OUR EMBASSIES 
IN KENYA AND TANZANIA, WE HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE OF AT 
LEAST 18 OTHER SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERROR AND VIOLENCE 
PLANNED OR CARRIED OUT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SITES WE 
HAVE JUST TARGETED. 
 
THESE ACTS RANGE FROM THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK; THE MACHINE GUNNING OF MORE THAN 60 
INNOCENT EUROPEAN TOURISTS AND EGYPTIANS IN LUXOR; A 
CAR BOMB AGAINST THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN THAT 
KILLED MORE THAN 20 EGYPTIANS AND PAKISTANIS; 
CONSPIRACY TO KILL U.S. SERVICEMEN IN YEMEN, EN ROUTE 
TO \"OPERATION RESTORE HOPE;\" PLOTS TO BLOW UP SIX U.S. 
AIRLINERS IN THE PACIFIC AND TO KILL THE POPE; ATTACKS 
ON UN PEACEKEEPERS IN SOMALIA; ATTACKS ON U.S. AND 
SAUDI TRAINING FACILITIES, AND ON AND ON. 
 
BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK HAS PUBLICLY AND REPEATEDLY 
PRONOUNCED A CLEAR AND VIOLENT ANTI-U.S. AGENDA, 
RANGING FROM HIS \"DECLARATION OF WAR\" AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES IN AUGUST 1996 TO HIS THREATS OVER THE 
WEEKEND, CLAIMING HE WILL CAUSE \"THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.\" 
 
ON THURSDAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON LAID OUT FOUR REASONS 
WHY HE ORDERED THIS ACTION: 
 
-- (1) WE HAVE CONVINCING EVIDENCE THESE GROUPS PLAYED 
THE KEY ROLE IN THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND 
TANZANIA; 
 
-- (2) THESE GROUPS HAVE EXECUTED TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE PAST; 
 
-- (3) WE HAVE COMPELLING INFORMATION THEY WERE 
PLANNING MORE ATTACKS ON OUR CITIZENS AND OTHERS, WITH 
THE INEVITABLE COLLATERAL CASUALTIES WE SAW SO 
TRAGICALLY IN AFRICA; AND 
 
-- (4) WE HAD URGENT INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE ABOUT 
TO ACQUIRE CHEMICAL WEAPONS. 
 
ON THIS LATTER POINT, LET ME EXPLAIN THAT WE WERE 
PARTICULARLY DISTURBED BY STRONG EVIDENCE INDICATING 
THAT A SITE OUTSIDE OF KHARTOUM -- IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
THE USAMA BIN LADEN NETWORK -- WAS INVOLVED IN AN 
EFFORT TO PRODUCE THE DEADLY NERVE AGENT VX.  OUR 
INTELLIGENCE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAS INDICATED 
THAT THE BIN LADEN NETWORK HAS BEEN ACTIVELY SEEKING TO 
ACQUIRE CHEMICAL WEAPONS FOR USE AGAINST UNITED STATES 
INTERESTS.  BIN LADEN HAS EXTENSIVE TIES TO THE 
SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND ITS INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. 
 
WE ARE CONFIDENT THE TARGETED SUDANESE FACILITY WAS 
INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGENTS. 
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE HORROR THESE TERRORISTS WOULD 
HAVE INFLICTED IF THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO PRODUCE AND 
EVENTUALLY USE VX -- A SUBSTANCE MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND 
DEADLY THAN THAT USED IN THE TOKYO SUBWAY ATTACKS. 
 
LET ME ALSO STRESS, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WE DID NOT MAKE 
THE DECISION TO USE FORCE LIGHTLY.  OUR FIRST 
PREFERENCE, AS IN OTHER SUCH CASES, WOULD HAVE BEEN TO 
BRING THE TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE IN A COMPETENT COURT OF 
LAW, AND TO SHUT DOWN THEIR FACILITIES AND TURN THEM 
OVER TO MORE LEGITIMATE USES. 
 
WE TRIED TO DO THIS THROUGH CONTACTS WITH RELEVANT 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND SUDAN.  AMBASSADOR 
RICHARDSON PERSONALLY RAISED THIS MATTER WITH TALIBAN 
LEADERS IN KABUL.  ONLY AFTER WE EXHAUSTED DIPLOMATIC 
EFFORTS -- AND AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE FACED NEW 
ATTACKS AGAINST US AND OTHERS -- DID WE HAVE TO ACT. 
 
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REMIND COUNCIL MEMBERS OF A UN 
DECLARATION ON TERRORISM, ADOPTED BY CONSENSUS DURING 
THE 49TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN 1994.  ARTICLE 5 OF THAT 
DOCUMENT DECLARES THAT STATES MUST FULFIL THEIR 
OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
AND GOES ON TO LIST WHAT THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARE: 
 
-- \"TO REFRAIN FROM ORGANIZING, INSTIGATING, 
FACILITATING, FINANCING, ENCOURAGING OR TOLERATING 
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRACTICAL 
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIES 
ARE NOT USED FOR TERRORIST INSTALLATIONS OR TRAINING 
CAMPS.\" 
 
IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT ALL 
STATES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM 
USING THEIR TERRITORY OR FACILITIES TO PLAN AND COMMIT 
ACTS OF TERROR.  IN ADDITION TO THE DECLARATION CITED, 
THERE ARE 11 INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CONVENTIONS THAT 
PROHIBIT THIS. 
 
STATES THAT FAIL TO UPHOLD THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PREVENT 
TERRORISM SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE 
THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: IRAQ SENDS LETTER PRE-EMPTIVELY TAKING 
ISSUE WITH THE SECRETARY\'S FEBRUARY 5 PRESENTATION 
 
1. (U) IRAQI FM NAJI SABRI SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL (S/2003/132), CONCERNING THE U.S. 
PRESENTATION TO THE COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY 5.  THE FULL TEXT OF 
THE LETTER FOLLOWS IN PARA 2. 
 
2. (U) BEGIN TEXT. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS 
CALLED FOR A MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 5 FEBRUARY 
2003 AT WHICH UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL 
WILL PRESENT WHAT HAS BEEN DUBBED \"EVIDENCE OF IRAQ\'S 
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\" 
 
THIS PLAY-ACTING HAS BECOME TRANSPARENT AFTER THE SUBMISSION 
BY THE UNITED STATES OF MORE THAN ONE REPORT FILLED WITH 
ALLEGATIONS AND ACCUSATIONS DEVOID OF ANY EVIDENCE TO 
SUBSTANTIATE THEM, SUCH AS THE REPORT ANNEXED TO THE SPEECH 
OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT BUSH BEFORE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
ON 12 SEPTEMBER 2002, ENTITLED \"A DECADE OF DECEPTION AND 
DEFIANCE,\" AND THE REPORT OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
(CIA) OF OCTOBER 2002, ENTITLED \"IRAQ\'S WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION PROGRAMS.\" IN BOTH THOSE REPORTS, THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION ACCUSED IRAQ OF DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION AT MORE THAN 50 SITES. BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
TONY BLAIR HAS PLAYED A SUPPORTING ROLE IN THIS REGARD, 
PUBLISHING A SIMILAR REPORT IN OCTOBER 2002 IN WHICH HE 
CLAIMED THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIFIC SITES IN IRAQ AT WHICH 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE BEING DEVELOPED. 
 
AFTER IRAQ ACCEPTED THE RETURN OF THE INSPECTORS ON 16 
SEPTEMBER 2002 AND AGREED TO DEAL WITH SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION 1441 (2002), THE UNITED NATIONS MONITORING, 
VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION COMMISSION (UNMOVIC) AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) WERE REQUESTED TO 
ACCORD PRIORITY, IN RESUMING INSPECTIONS, TO SITES ALLEGED BY 
THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN TO BE DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF 
MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAMMES. 
 
INSPECTION WORK BEGAN ON 27 NOVEMBER 2002. AFTER TWO MONTHS 
OF INTENSIVE INSPECTIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF 
STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT FOR DETECTING ANY PROSCRIBED 
NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND THE ANALYSIS OF 
WATER, SOIL AND AIR SAMPLES ALL OVER IRAQ DURING 518 TOURS OF 
INSPECTION COMPRISING ALL THE SITES THAT WERE THE OBJECT OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR\'S ACCUSATIONS, AS 
WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER SITES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS 
IN IRAQI CITIES, THE REPORT OF MESSRS. BLIX AND ELBARADEI, 
SUBMITTED TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 27 JANUARY 2003, 
SUBSTANTIATED IRAQ\'S DECLARATIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED 
THAT THE REPORTS OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR 
WERE DEVOID OF TRUTH AND HAD BEEN DRAFTED IN ORDER TO DISTORT 
THE PICTURE OF IRAQ AND CREATE PRETEXTS FOR AGGRESSION 
AGAINST IRAQ AND AGAINST THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 
 
PERHAPS THIS FACT EXPLAINS THE URGENT REQUESTS ADDRESSED TO 
STATES BY MESSRS. BLIX AND ELBARADEI TO PROVIDE UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA WITH VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE OF ANY PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES, 
SUBSTANCES OR MATERIALS IN IRAQ AND THE INSISTENCE OF STATES 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT THOSE STATES WHICH ARE 
ALLEGING THAT IRAQ IS DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
SUBMIT THEIR EVIDENCE TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA PURSUANT TO 
PARAGRAPH 10 OF RESOLUTION 1441 (2002), WHICH READS, 
\"REQUESTS ALL MEMBER STATES TO GIVE FULL SUPPORT TO UNMOVIC 
AND THE IAEA IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR MANDATES, INCLUDING BY 
PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION RELATED TO PROHIBITED PROGRAMMES OR 
OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR MANDATES ...\" 
 
ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE TEXT, CONTAINED IN THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTION, WE REQUEST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, THROUGH YOU, TO SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY ITS ALLEGED 
EVIDENCE TO THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ENTRUSTED BY THE UNITED 
NATIONS WITH VERIFYING SUCH ALLEGATIONS, NAMELY UNMOVIC (IF 
THEY RELATE TO PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES IN THE CHEMICAL, 
BIOLOGICAL OR MISSILE FIELDS) OR IAEA (IF THEY RELATE TO 
PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES IN THE NUCLEAR FIELD), SO AS TO ENABLE 
THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS TO BEGIN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS 
IMMEDIATELY AND INFORM THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE CORRECT. 
 
IN THIS CONNECTION, WE CAUTION AGAINST USING THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OR THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS FORUMS FOR SPREADING 
FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND FABRICATED EVIDENCE IN OPEN DISREGARD 
FOR THE MECHANISMS PRESCRIBED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, UNSC, IZ 
SUBJECT: UNSC/IRAQ:  SECRETARY POWELL MAKES THE CASE; THE 
COUNCIL DELIVERS PRELIMINARY RESPONSES 
 
1.  (U)  SECRETARY POWELL MADE AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN 
MINUTE-PRESENTATION FEBRUARY 5 TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
(SC) IN WHICH HE OUTLINED, IN DETAIL: IRAQI EFFORTS TO DEFEAT 
UNMOVIC AND IAEA INSPECTIONS; IRAQ\'S FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR 
WMD AND OTHER MATERIALS IT WAS KNOWN TO HAVE POSSESSED; AND 
IRAQ\'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE AL-QAEDA TERRORIST NETWORK, WITH 
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE 
ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI.  USING A COMBINATION OF TRANSLATED 
INTERCEPTS, SATELLITE IMAGERY, AND REPORTS FROM HUMAN 
SOURCES, THE SECRETARY, FLANKED BY AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND 
CIA DIRECTOR TENET, LAID OUT THE U.S. POSITION THAT UN 
INSPECTIONS WERE NOT WORKING, AND COULD NOT SUCCEED, IN THE 
ABSENCE OF ACTIVE IRAQI COOPERATION.  IN THE POST-SEPTEMBER 
11 ENVIRONMENT, HE WARNED, THE USG COULD NOT EXPOSE ITS 
CITIZENS TO THE KIND OF DANGERS POSED BY A NEXUS BETWEEN 
IRAQI WMD AND TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL, HE 
WARNED, HAD TO FACE UP TO THE CHALLENGES POSED BY IRAQI 
NON-COMPLIANCE OR FACE \"IRRELEVANCE.\"  REACTIONS FROM COUNCIL 
MEMBERS WERE MUTED, IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAD HAD NO ADVANCE 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SECRETARY\'S BRIEFING.  SOME 
EXISTING FAULT LINES IN THE COUNCIL REMAINED CLEAR, WITH 
CHINA, GERMANY, SYRIA, AND PAKISTAN ARGUING THAT MORE TIME 
SHOULD BE ALLOTTED TO THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS.  SPAIN AND 
CHILE EXPRESSED EXASPERATION WITH IRAQI NON-COMPLIANCE BUT 
DID NOT GO AS FAR AS BULGARIA, WHICH DECLARED IRAQ IN 
MATERIAL BREACH OF UNSCR 1441.  ANGOLA, CAMEROON, AND GUINEA 
FIRMLY FENCE-STRADDLED WHILE FRANCE APPEARED TO EMBRACE ALL 
OPTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER DE VILLEPIN 
MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRENGTHENING THE 
INSPECTIONS REGIME WHILE DEMANDING AT THE SAME TIME 
\"IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE\" IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH UN 
INSPECTIONS.  IRAQI PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AL-DOURI ROUNDLY 
REJECTED THE ENTIRE U.S. PRESENTATION AND ALLEGED THAT ISRAEL 
REPRESENTS THE \"REAL WMD THREAT\" IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
SECRETARY POWELL MAKES THE CASE 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) THE SECRETARY BEGAN HIS DETAILED, ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN 
MINUTE PRESENTATION BY FOCUSING ON IRAQ\'S EFFECTS TO DECEIVE 
UN INSPECTORS.  HE PLAYED SEVERAL RADIO INTERCEPTS, DETAILING 
EFFORTS BY IRAQI MILITARY OFFICERS TO HIDE ITEMS FROM 
INSPECTORS.  HE OUTLINED THE SCALE OF GOI GOVERNMENTAL 
EFFORTS TO MISLEAD INSPECTORS AND SHOWED SATELLITE PHOTOS 
DETAILING IRAQI MILITARY ACTIVITY IN ADVANCE OF THE ARRIVAL 
OF INSPECTORS.  HE ALSO DESCRIBED THE THREATS MADE BY THE GOI 
TO IRAQI SCIENTISTS TO PRECLUDE THEIR COOPERATION. 
 
3. (U) THE SECRETARY THEN GAVE A SENSE OF IRAQI WMD 
STOCKPILES AND EXPLAINED WHY THEY WERE OF CONCERN: 
 
--  BIOLOGICAL:  IRAQ HAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
BIOLOGICAL AGENTS.  THE SECRETARY HELD UP A TEASPOON OF 
ANTHRAX SIMULANT, DESCRIBED HOW AN EQUIVALENT QUANTITY MAILED 
IN AN ENVELOPE HAD SHUT DOWN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 
2001, AND NOTED THAT THE UNDECLARED IRAQI AMOUNTS EQUATED TO 
TENS UPON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TEASPOONFULS. THE SECRETARY 
ALSO EXPLAINED IRAQI PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEIR BIOLOGICAL 
PROGRAMS MOBILE, AND SHOWED CONCEPTUAL IMAGES OF IRAQI LABS 
LOCATED ON ORDINARY TRUCKS AND TRAINS. 
 
-- CHEMICAL:  THE SECRETARY PROVIDED A SENSE OF HOW MANY 
IRAQI CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE MISSING, CITING THE NUMBER USED 
IN THE PRESIDENT\'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND RECENT USG 
STATEMENTS. HE EXPLAINED THAT IRAQ HAD SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 
ITS DUAL-USE FACTORIES TO WITHSTAND INSPECTION, WHICH MEANT 
THAT IRAQI CW PRODUCTION DID NOT HAVE TO BE MOBILE.  THE 
SECRETARY DISPLAYED SATELLITE IMAGERY OF AN IRAQI CW 
TRANSSHIPMENT AREA THAT HAD BEEN BULLDOZED AND DENUDED OF 
TOPSOIL TO ENSURE THAT INSPECTORS DID NOT DETECT ANY CW 
TRACES IN THE SOIL.  HE PLAYED ANOTHER INTERCEPT OF IRAQI 
MILITARY OFFICERS DISCUSSING NERVE AGENT. 
 
-- NUCLEAR:  THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IRAQI MOVES TO KEEP 
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM ALIVE, SAYING THEY LACKED ONLY FISSILE 
MATERIAL, HAVING MAINTAINED CADRES OF NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS AND 
NUCLEAR BOMB DESIGNS.  HE DESCRIBED IRAQI NUCLEAR-RELATED 
PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR TUBES, 
BALANCING MACHINES, AND SPECIALIZED MAGNETS.  HE REMINDED THE 
WORLD THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD UNDERESTIMATED THE 
IRAQI NUCLEAR PROGRAM BEFORE AND CHALLENGED IT NOT TO DO SO 
AGAIN. 
 
--  DELIVERY SYSTEMS: THE SECRETARY EXPLAINED GOI WORK ON 
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVS).  HE 
DESCRIBED IRAQI HOLDINGS OF AL-SAMOUD AND AL-FATAH MISSILES, 
EXPLAINING THAT BOTH HAVE RANGES EXCEEDING UN LIMITS AND THAT 
THEY ARE THEREFORE PROHIBITED.  HE NOTED IRAQI EFFORTS TO 
ILLEGALLY IMPORT MISSILE COMPONENTS SUCH AS SA-2 ROCKET 
ENGINES, AND TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT SOME HAD BEEN ACQUIRED 
AFTER THE PASSAGE OF UNSCR 1441.  HE DESCRIBED THE IRAQI UAV 
PROGRAMS, QUOTING EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF UAV DEVELOPMENT, 
DEPLOYMENT, AND ABILITY  TO DISTRIBUTE BIOLOGICAL AND 
CHEMICAL AGENTS.  HE DESCRIBED A RECENT IRAQI UAV FLIGHT THAT 
STRETCHED FOR 500 KILOMETERS, VIOLATING UN RANGE LIMITS, AND 
REMINDED THE COUNCIL THAT IRAQ HAD NOT PROVIDED UAV 
INFORMATION IN ITS DECEMBER 7 DECLARATION. 
 
4.  (U) TURNING TO TERRORISM, THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IRAQ\'S 
LONG-STANDING TIES TO PALESTINIAN TERROR GROUPS.  HE NOTED 
TERRORIST ACTS COMMITTED IN EUROPE BY THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE.  THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IRAQ\'S LINKS WITH 
AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI, OUTLINING HIS 
ACTIVITIES IN BAGHDAD, THE LACK OF IRAQI RESPONSE TO REQUESTS 
FOR HIS DETENTION AND EXTRADITION, AND HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT LAURENCE FOLEY IN JORDAN IN 
2002.  HE EXPLAINED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN AL-QAEDA AND 
AL-ZARQAWI WITH TERRORIST ACTIONS IN THE UK, SPAIN, ITALY, 
GERMANY, AND RUSSIA.   HE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AL-QAEDA\'S 
EFFORTS IN GAINING WMD ASSISTANCE FROM IRAQ, PARTICULARLY IN 
OBTAINING TRAINING IN THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF CHEMICAL AND 
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. 
 
5. (U)  THE SECRETARY CONCLUDED BY DESCRIBING IRAQ\'S 
DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, INCLUDING ATROCITIES 
COMMITTED AGAINST THE KURDS, SHIA, AND MARSH ARABS.  HE 
REMINDED THE COUNCIL THAT SADDAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO INTIMIDATE 
THE MIDDLE EAST FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AND OF HIS DETERMINED 
EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MORE WMD.  HE ASKED THE COUNCIL WHETHER 
THE WORLD SHOULD TAKE THE RISK THAT IRAQ WOULD USE WMD IN A 
TIME AND PLACE OF ITS CHOOSING, AT A FUTURE POINT WHEN THE 
WORLD WAS IN A MUCH WEAKER POSITION TO RESPOND TO IRAQI 
ACTIONS.  HE DECLARED THAT THE U.S. WILL NOT AND CAN NOT RUN 
SUCH A RISK, SAID IRAQ HAD PLACED ITSELF IN DEEPER MATERIAL 
BREACH UNDER UNSCR 1441, AND CHALLENGED THE WORLD NOT TO 
SHRINK FROM WHATEVER IS AHEAD OF IT. 
 
 
STATEMENTS BY THE PERMANENT FIVE MEMBERS: 
 
FRANCE: WE DO NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER DE VILLEPIN SAID THE 
SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION CONTAINED ELEMENTS OF INTEREST THAT 
THE INSPECTORS SHOULD ASSESS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE SECRETARY\'S 
INDICTMENT OF IRAQI NON-COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTIONS, 
VILLEPIN STRESSED THAT, BY ADOPTING UNSCR 1441, THE COUNCIL 
HAD REAFFIRMED RELIANCE ON AN INSPECTIONS PROCESS, AND 
ASSERTED THAT THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION PROVIDED FURTHER 
JUSTIFICATION \"TO THE COURSE OF THE UN\" AND INTERNATIONAL 
INSPECTIONS.  HE ARGUED THAT, THROUGH THE INSPECTIONS REGIME, 
RESULTS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED:  UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA WERE BOTH IN 
IRAQ AT WORK, THERE HAS BEEN A MULTIPLICATION OF SITES 
INSPECTED, AND THERE WERE MORE THAN 100 INSPECTORS ON THE 
GROUND.  \"GOOD PROGRESS\" HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN DEEPENING THE 
IAEA\'S KNOWLEDGE OF IRAQI NUCLEAR CAPACITY, ACCORDING TO 
EL-BARADEI, AND ACCORDING TO BLIX, THERE HAD BEEN NO TRACE OF 
CBW MATERIALS IN THE TRACE SAMPLES TAKEN TO DATE.  BUT, 
VILLEPIN SAID, \"IRAQI COOPERATION CONTAINED GREY AREAS.\"  THE 
JANUARY 27 BLIX REPORT CONTAINED EVIDENCE OF REAL PROBLEMS IN 
THIS AREA. TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COOPERATION, FRANCE 
WILL CONTINUE TO PASS INFORMATION TO FACILITATE THE 
INSPECTIONS, HE ADDED.  THE ABSENCE OF LONG-RANGE DELIVERY 
SYSTEMS HAS, TO DATE, LARGELY CONTAINED THE THREAT OF CBW, 
BUT THERE WERE \"DISTURBING INDICATIONS ABOUT ATTEMPTS TO 
ACQUIRE SUCH SYSTEMS.\" HE ALSO STRESSED A NEED TO \"KEEP AN 
EYE ON\" THE ALUMINUM TUBES ISSUE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT SIGNIFY. 
 
7. (U) THE COUNCIL AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST 
DELIVER A DIFFICULT MESSAGE TO IRAQ, VILLEPIN STATED. THE USE 
OF FORCE WAS THE FINAL RECOURSE, AND WHY GO TO WAR, HE ASKED, 
IF THERE IS \"UNUSED SPACE\" IN UNSCR 1441?   VILLEPIN ARGUED 
THAT THE COUNCIL MUST DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT THE \"NATURE 
AND SCOPE\" OF IRAQI VIOLATIONS JUSTIFIED THE USE OF FORCE, 
DECLARING \"WE WILL NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTION, AS WE HAVE SAID 
ALL ALONG.\" VILLEPIN MADE THE FOLLOWING KEY POINTS: 
 
--THE UN MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE 
TO IRAQ, AS A MEANS TO GUARANTEE THE UNITY OF IRAQ, ASSURE 
REGIONAL STABILITY, PRESERVE INTERNATIONAL UNITY, AND PROTECT 
CIVILIAN POPULATIONS; 
 
--THERE SHOULD BE \"DECISIVE REINFORCEMENT OF THE MEANS OF 
INSPECTIONS.\"  THIS WOULD INCLUDE INCREASING BY TWO TO THREE 
TIMES THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS, ESTABLISHING SURVEILLANCE OF 
SITES INSPECTED BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, DEPLOYING AERIAL 
SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT, AND CREATING A COORDINATING AND 
PROCESSING CENTER FOR RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE; 
 
--WE SHOULD LIST AND \"RANK\" UNRESOLVED DISARMAMENT QUESTIONS; 
 
--THERE MUST BE REGULAR PROGRESS IN DISARMAMENT.  IT WOULD BE 
USEFUL TO ESTABLISH A POSITION FOR A NEW DISARMAMENT 
COORDINATOR IN BAGHDAD TO COORDINATE WITH BLIX AND 
EL-BARADEI; 
 
--IRAQ MUST \"IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY\" COMPLY BY AGREEING 
TO U-2 FLIGHTS, ADOPTING A LEGAL PROHIBITION ON WMD, AND 
HANDING OVER ALL PROBABLE INFORMATION ON CBW PROGRAMS; AND 
 
--BAGHDAD MUST ALSO NOW PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS 
RAISED BY SECRETARY POWELL\'S BRIEFING.  BY THE NEXT REPORT OF 
THE INSPECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, IRAQ MUST HAVE DEMONSTRATED 
THAT IT IS PROVIDING CONCRETE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION. 
FRANCE HAS A \"MORAL AND POLITICAL DUTY TO DIRECT MORAL AND 
POLITICAL ENERGY\" TO ENSURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. 
 
 
RUSSIA: NO CONCRETE TIME LIMITS TO 1441, 
BUT IT\'S TIME FOR BAGHDAD TO GET THE MESSAGE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) FM IVANOV NOTED RUSSIA\'S DESIRE FOR A POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT TO THE IRAQ CRISIS AND CALLED ON IRAQ TO FULLY AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF UNSCR 1441. 
HE STATED THAT GIVEN THE UNANIMOUS DESIRE OF THE COUNCIL TO 
DEAL WITH WMD CONCERNS WORLD-WIDE, IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF 
ALL MEMBERS TO WORK TOGETHER THROUGH THE COUNCIL AND THE UN 
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY 
POWELL WAS SERIOUS AND REQUIRED THOROUGH STUDY BY MOSCOW. HE 
ASKED THAT THIS INFORMATION ALSO BE HANDED OVER TO THE 
INSPECTORS, IN ORDER TO ALLOW IRAQ AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND 
TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED. IVANOV URGED THE COUNCIL TO DO 
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE 
INSPECTORS--RUSSIA, HE NOTED, FOR ITS PART WAS READY TO 
PROVIDE AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE PLANES AND ADDITIONAL 
INSPECTORS AS NEEDED. 
 
9. (U)  IVANOV STATED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR BAGHDAD TO 
UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE SITUATION. HE POINTED 
OUT \"IRAQ SHOULD BE THE FIRST CONCERNED\" WITH PROVIDING FINAL 
CLARITY TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT AND THAT THE END OF 
SANCTIONS RESTED IN IRAQ\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE.  HE ALSO 
STATED THAT, ALTHOUGH HE HAS OFTEN HEARD THAT \"TIME IS 
RUNNING OUT\" FOR IRAQ, THERE ARE NO CONCRETE TIME LIMITS 
ATTACHED TO UNSCR 1441, AND THE COUNCIL SHOULD NOT RULE OUT 
THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE--OR MORE--RESOLUTIONS. IN CLOSING, 
IVANOV OPINED THAT THE MORE SERIOUS CHALLENGE FACING THE 
WORLD--INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM--WAS BEING DEALT WITH 
EFFECTIVELY AS A RESULT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND 
UNITY. HE URGED THE MEMBERS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE IN THE 
SAME MANNER. 
 
UK: IRAQ HAS FAILED THE TEST, 
COUNCIL ON THE EDGE OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) UK FM STRAW WELCOMED THE POWERFUL AND AUTHORITATIVE 
EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE U.S. AND STATED THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OWED THANKS TO SECRETARY POWELL FOR 
ILLUSTRATING THE GRAVE DANGERS POSED BY IRAQ.  STRAW NOTED 
THAT THE COUNCIL HAD GIVEN IRAQ ONE LAST CHANCE TO COMPLY 
FULLY WITH ITS DISARMAMENT OBLIGATIONS IN UNSCR 1441--A 
RESOLUTION TO WHICH SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD RESPONDED WITH THE 
SAME CONTEMPT AS THE MANY RESOLUTIONS BEFORE IT. STRAW STATED 
THAT IRAQ HAD VIOLATED BOTH \"TESTS\" SET FORTH IN OP 4 OF 
1441--NAMELY THE OMISSION OF INFORMATION IN ITS DECLARATION, 
AND ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE AND DISARM WILLINGLY, 
INCLUDING ITS REFUSAL TO PERMIT U-2 FLIGHTS. STRAW DECLARED 
THAT IRAQ\'S ACTION TO DATE COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED AS 
FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH AND,  WHILE THE UK DOES NOT WANT WAR, 
HMG DOES WANT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE UN SYSTEM TO BE UPHELD. 
STRAW NOTED THAT, WHILE SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THE GOI HAD 
SERIOUS CHOICES TO MAKE, THE COUNCIL HAD A SERIOUS CHOICE AS 
WELL. CITING THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FAILURES OF THE 
LEAGUE OF NATIONS, HE OBSERVED THAT THE COUNCIL WAS AT RISK 
OF SLIPPING DOWN THE SAME SLOPE IF IT CHOSE INACTION.  WE OWE 
IT TO HISTORY, HE SAID, NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN. 
 
CHINA: AVOID WAR IF POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IS AT ALL POSSIBLE 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
11. (U) CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER TANG UNDERSCORED THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S DESIRE TO MAINTAIN COUNCIL UNITY 
AND COOPERATION ON THE ISSUE OF IRAQ.  TANG NOTED THAT THE 
U.S. INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE THE COUNCIL AND THE INSPECTORS 
WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF 
UNSCR 1441, AND HE URGED ALL OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW THE U.S. 
EXAMPLE.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE COUNCIL\'S UNITED GOAL TO 
DISARM IRAQ WAS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF 
UNSCR 1441, AND HE CALLED ON IRAQ TO ADHERE TO ITS 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENT THE 
MEASURES CALLED FOR IN THAT RESOLUTION.  TANG ALSO STATED 
THAT THE UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT SHOULD 
BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE UN FRAMEWORK AND HE URGED THE 
COUNCIL TO AVOID WAR IF A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WAS EVEN 
REMOTELY POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 
THE ELECTED TEN MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL: 
 
GERMANY: VITAL TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE INSPECTIONS REGIME 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
12.  (U) GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER FISCHER AFFIRMED THAT THE 
UNSC SHOULD BE PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN DECISION MAKING ON 
IRAQ.  THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WARRANTED CAREFUL 
EXAMINATION AND A QUICK AND CLEAR RESPONSE BY IRAQ.   FOR 
INSPECTIONS TO BE BETTER TARGETED, DETAILED INFORMATION WAS 
NECESSARY.  FISCHER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IRAQ HAS REPEATEDLY 
FLOUTED UNSCRS OVER THE TWELVE-YEAR SPAN IN WHICH IT HAS 
FIGURED ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA; HE SAID IRAQ WAS A BRUTAL 
REGIME THAT HAD ATTACKED IRAN, KUWAIT, ISRAEL, AS WELL AS THE 
KURDS, AND IT WAS THAT AGGRESSION THAT JUSTIFIED THE 
IMPOSITION OF NO-FLY ZONES.  WHILE THE PRESENCE OF INSPECTORS 
IN IRAQ HELPED CONTAIN THE DANGER, LASTING DISARMAMENT 
REMAINED THE TRUE OBJECTIVE.  THE INSPECTIONS REQUIRED 
GREATER REINFORCEMENT AND, ABOVE ALL, MORE TIME.  THE 
UPCOMING TRIP OF BLIX AND EL-BARADEI TO BAGHDAD WAS A CRUCIAL 
CHANCE FOR IRAQ TO DISPEL SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEIR PROGRAMS AND 
CAPACITIES.  WARNING AGAINST THE \"CLEAR DANGERS\" OF MILITARY 
ACTION, FISCHER CALLED FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE 
CRISIS WITHIN THE UN FRAMEWORK. IT WAS VITAL TO EXPAND AND 
ENHANCE THE INSPECTIONS REGIME OF UNSCR 1441 WHICH, FISCHER 
SUGGESTED, COULD PROVE A PARADIGM FOR APPROACHING CRISES 
ELSEWHERE.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT IRAQ MUST COMPLY WITHOUT DELAY 
WITH UNSCR 1441. 
 

MEXICO: POWELL\'S PRESENTATION VALUABLE 
TO PROCESS OF DISARMING IRAQ 
-------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (U) MEXICAN MINISTER OF STATE (FOREIGN MINISTER) DERBEZ 
SAID THAT THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION HAD CONTAINED VALUABLE 
MATERIAL TO DETERMINE AND SHAPE THE PROCESS OF DISARMING 
IRAQ, AND HE REINFORCED THE NEED TO DEVELOP VERIFIABLE IRAQI 
COOPERATION.  HE UNDERSCORED THAT MEXICO\'S OBJECTIVE WAS THE 
UNEQUIVOCAL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ BY PEACEFUL MEANS, WITHOUT 
UNDERMINING THE BATTLE ON TERRORISM.  MEXICO HAD DIRECTLY 
APPROACHED IRAQ TO \"ENCOURAGE\" COOPERATION WITHOUT DELAY, AND 
HE REITERATED THE CALL \"TO THE IRAQI REPRESENTATIVE AT THIS 
TABLE\" TO ACTIVELY AND GENUINELY COOPERATE ACCORDING TO THE 
PROVISIONS OF UNSCR 1441.  HE LATER \"REITERATED THE DEMAND TO 
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WORK URGENTLY TO MAKE ALL 
FACILITIES\" ACCESSIBLE TO THE INSPECTORS.  CONCLUDING, HE 
STRESSED MEXICO\'S DESIRE FOR A MULTILATERAL APPROACH TO 
RESOLVING THE IRAQ CRISIS. 
 
SYRIA:  COUNCIL SHOULD PERMIT MORE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
14.  (U)  SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE, READING A STATEMENT ON BEHALF 
OF FOREIGN MINISTER AL-SHARA\', SIDESTEPPED DIRECT COMMENT ON 
SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION BY RECOMMENDING THAT THE INFORMATION 
IT CONTAINED  SHOULD BE REVIEWED BY UNMOVIC AND IAEA.  HE 
APPEALED TO OTHER MEMBER STATES ALSO TO SUBMIT RELEVANT 
INFORMATION.  HE NOTED SYRIA HAD JOINED CONSENSUS ON UNSCR 
1441 AFTER RECEIVING GUARANTEES FROM UNNAMED PERMANENT 
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD NOT BE USED 
AS A PRETEXT FOR WAR.  WEHBE SAID THAT SYRIA INTERPRETED 
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS OF A SECOND RESOLUTION AS CONFIRMATION OF 
THOSE ASSURANCES.  URGING THE SC TO FIND A PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION OF THE CRISIS, WEHBE DECRIED CONSIDERATION OF WAR 
AS AN INDICATION OF THE  FAILURE OF UNSCR 1441 AND, MORE 
GENERALLY, OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ITSELF.  AVERTING CONFLICT 
WAS IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO SPARE THE LIVES OF IRAQI 
CIVILIANS, AS WELL AS THE \"LIVES OF THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD 
TRAVELED TO THE REGION.\" IRAQ -- \"UNLIKE ISRAEL\" -- NEITHER 
OCCUPIED TERRITORY ILLEGALLY NOR POSED A DANGER TO 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES; INSPECTIONS WOULD ALWAYS INVOLVE 
HITCHES, YET THESE HITCHES DID NOT JUSTIFY WAR.  THE COUNCIL 
SHOULD PERMIT MORE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS AND ALL MEMBER STATES 
SHOULD ACTIVELY COOPERATE WITH UNSCR 1441  BY PROVIDING 
INFORMATION TO INSPECTORS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PREVIOUS 
RESOLUTIONS, THE COUNCIL SHOULD LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAQ AND 
IMPLEMENT THE CALL FOR A WMD-FREE ZONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
WEHBE LAUDED REGIONAL EFFORTS TOWARDS  A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, 
AND STRESSED THAT ANY MILITARY OPTION SHOULD ONLY BE 
EXERCISED WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK. 
 
PAKISTAN: INSPECTORS\' REPORTS 
SHOULD CONSTITUTE BASIS FOR SC DECISION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (U)  PAKISTANI FOREIGN MINISTER KASURI DESCRIBED THE DAY 
AS A CRITICAL AND HISTORIC MOMENT IN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND 
SECURITY, AND HE WELCOMED THE U.S. \"DETERMINATION IN WORKING 
THROUGH THE UN VIA UNSCR 1441.\"  SECRETARY POWELL HAD 
PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO 
THE PROVISIONS OF 1441, WHICH SHOULD ENHANCE THE INSPECTORS\' 
EFFECTIVENESS.  SUCH ENHANCEMENT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP 
FORWARD IN ELIMINATING IRAQ\'S WMD PROGRAMS.  HE HOPED THE 
\"CONCERNS\" RAISED WOULD RECEIVE \"CREDIBLE ANSWERS.\"  THE 
PROVISIONS OF UNSCRS 687, 1284, AND 1441 WERE ALL CLEAR, HE 
STRESSED.  THE COUNCIL BROADLY SHARED THE VIEW THAT MORE 
ACTIVE COOPERATION WAS REQUIRED, AND IN THAT CONTEXT, BLIX 
AND EL-BARADEI HAD SET OUT THREE CONDITIONS: USE OF UNMANNED 
AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES (UAVS); PRIVATE INTERVIEWS; 
AND IRAQI LEGISLATION.  IRAQ SHOULD MOVE SWIFTLY TO MEET 
THESE REQUIREMENTS AND TO RESPOND TO ANY SUBSEQUENT 
REQUIREMENTS.  KASURI ASSERTED THAT THE JANUARY 27 BRIEFINGS 
TO THE COUNCIL WERE NOT MEANT TO BE CONCLUSIVE.  THE 
INSPECTORS\' REPORTS SHOULD CONSTITUTE THE CENTRAL BASIS ON 
WHICH A UNSC DECISION WOULD BE PREDICATED, CONSISTENT WITH 
THE OBJECTIVES OF EARLY COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ, AMELIORATION OF 
THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, THE PRESERVATION OF IRAQ\'S 
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND THE PRESERVATION 
OF PEACE IN THE REGION, \"INCLUDING THE DISPUTE OVER JAMMU AND 
KASHMIR.\" 
 
SPAIN: IRAQ VIOLATED 1441, 
OPTION FOR PEACE RESTS WITH SADDAM 
---------------------------------- 
 
16. (U)  SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER PALACIOS RECOGNIZED THAT, 
ONCE AGAIN, THE U.S. HAD COME TO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS BY BRINGING IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL.  SECRETARY POWELL HAD SET COMPELLING DATA BEFORE THE 
COUNCIL:  THE EXISTENCE OF WMD PROGRAMS AND CONFIRMATION OF 
IRAQI DECEPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  PALACIOS 
SAID THAT IRAQ HAD VIOLATED ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSCR 1441. 
 THE COUNCIL COULD NOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF 
MASS DESTRUCTION, AS SUCH ACQUISITION WOULD ENDANGER 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.  IT JEOPARDIZED THE VERY 
EXISTENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ONLY ONE 
EXPLANATION OF THE IRAQI RESPONSE TO UNSCR 1441 WAS POSSIBLE: 
 SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS NOT RENOUNCED HIS PLANS TO USE SUCH 
WEAPONS AS HE HAS USED THEM IN THE PAST.  SPAIN WAS GREATLY 
CONCERNED THAT THESE WEAPONS MIGHT ALSO FALL INTO THE HANDS 
OF A TERRORIST. 
 
17.  (U) INSPECTIONS COULD ONLY BEAR FRUIT IF IRAQ COOPERATED 
ACTIVELY, SHE STRESSED.  IT WAS TIME FOR IRAQ TO VOLUNTARILY 
DISARM, AND THE INSPECTORS WERE THERE TO WITNESS DISARMAMENT 
ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  BUT SADDAM HUSSEIN 
LACKS THE WILL TO RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S 
DEMAND FOR DISARMAMENT WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT CONCEALMENT. 
ALTHOUGH INSPECTIONS WERE A VALUABLE INSTRUMENT, IN TWELVE 
YEARS, IRAQ HAS STILL NOT DISARMED.  IT WAS TIME FOR A CLEAR 
MESSAGE THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S PROGRAMS WERE A THREAT TO 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, AND THAT DISARMAMENT MUST 
BE IMMEDIATE, COMPLETE, AND FINAL.  DESPITE IRAQ\'S CONTINUED 
NON-COMPLIANCE, THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE FOR PEACE IF IRAQ 
RADICALLY MODIFIED ITS BEHAVIOR.  THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
PEACE IN IRAQ RESTS WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.  THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IS OFFERING ONE LAST CHANCE UNDER 1441 FOR PEACEFUL 
DISARMAMENT, SHE WARNED. 
 
CHILE: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATES UNSCR 1441, 
COUNCIL MUST USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
18.  (U)  CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER VALENZUELA SAID THE 
SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION POINTED TO A PATTERN OF DEFIANCE AND 
RESISTANCE TO UNCONDITIONAL, IMMEDIATE, AND COMPLETE 
DISARMAMENT, AS FIRST CALLED FOR UNDER UNSCR 687.  UNSCR 1441 
GAVE ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR DISARMAMENT, YET A REGIME THAT 
HAD DRAGGED THE IRAQI PEOPLE INTO TWO WARS AND A SANCTIONS 
REGIME WAS TAKING MAJOR RISKS AGAIN.  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE IN A 
\"PIECEMEAL\" WAY AND THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER EVERY PIECE OF 
INFORMATION PROVIDED, INSTEAD OF PRESENTING IT VOLUNTARILY, 
WERE ALL IN VIOLATION OF 1441.  SUCH A MENTALITY DERIVED FROM 
A TOTALITARIAN REGIME, SHE EMPHASIZED, QUOTING BLIX\'S 
STATEMENT THAT IRAQ HAD NOT ARRIVED AT A GENUINE ACCEPTANCE 
OF ITS OBLIGATION TO DISARM. 
 
19.  (U) VALENZUELA NOTED THAT CHILE STILL SUPPORTED 
INSPECTIONS.  INSPECTIONS ALONE COULD \"IMPOSE THE LOGIC OF 
PEACE\" IF PRESSURE WAS KEPT UP ON IRAQ.  IT WAS UP TO UNMOVIC 
UNDER OP11 OF 1441 TO INFORM THE COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY OF ANY 
INTERFERENCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE 
INSPECTIONS, AND SECRETARY POWELL\'S ACCUSATIONS REQUIRED A 
FULL AND URGENT EXPLANATION BY IRAQ.  CHILE SUPPORTED 
\"RETAINING MULTILATERAL CONTROL IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS;\" 
THE PASSAGE OF 1441 WAS A DEMONSTRATION OF UNITY, AND THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD UNITY IN THE CRUCIAL 
SITUATION AHEAD.  THE IRAQI PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED OVER THE LONG 
TERM UNDER SANCTIONS.  IF THERE WAS NO \"RADICAL CHANGE\" IN 
IRAQ\'S ATTITUDE, THE COUNCIL MUST USE \"ALL MEANS AVAILABLE.\" 
 
BULGARIA: IRAQ IN MATERIAL BREACH, 
ALL MEANS SHOULD BE USED TO DISARM IRAQ 
--------------------------------------- 
 
20. (U) BULGARIAN FOREIGN MINISTER PASSY SAID THAT \"THE FACT 
THE U.S. HAD COME WITH STRONG, COMPELLING EVIDENCE SHEDS 
ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON IRAQI FAILURE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 
1441.\" HE HOPED THE INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO ASSIST 
UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA.  THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WOULD 
HAVE THE SAME \"MOBILIZING EFFECT\" ON THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY AS UNSCR 1441, REAFFIRMING TO THE IRAQIS THAT THIS 
WAS THEIR LAST CHANCE FOR DISARMAMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS.  THE 
JANUARY 27 UNMOVIC AND IAEA REPORTS TO THE COUNCIL NOTED THAT 
ACTIVE COOPERATION WAS A PREREQUISITE TO 1441, AND THE IRAQI 
LEVEL OF COOPERATION WAS NOT SATISFACTORY.  BULGARIA INSISTED 
THAT IRAQ SUPPLY ALL INFORMATION ABOUT WEAPONS PROGRAMS AND 
PROVIDE EVIDENCE IT HAD UNCONDITIONALLY AND FULLY CHANGED ITS 
ATTITUDE TO INSPECTIONS.  IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH OF 
PREVIOUS COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING UNSCR 1441, AND 
SECRETARY POWELL HAD PROVIDED NEW EVIDENCE OF THAT BREACH TO 
THE COUNCIL IN HIS PRESENTATION.  ALL MEANS SHOULD BE USED TO 
DISARM IRAQ, AND PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE.  IF 
THE INSPECTORS DO NOT REPORT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT IRAQ HAS 
CHANGED ITS ATTITUDE, HOWEVER, THE SECURITY COUNCIL MUST TAKE 
UP ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, HE CONCLUDED. 
 
CAMEROON: WAR IS NOT INEVITABLE, 
ANNAN SHOULD GO TO BAGHDAD 
-------------------------------- 
 
21. (U)  CAMEROONIAN MINISTER NGOUBEYOU STATED THAT THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SECRETARY WAS \"TROUBLING,\" AND HE 
URGED THE U.S. TO PROVIDE THE INSPECTORS THIS INFORMATION AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO GIVE THE 
INSPECTORS ADEQUATE TIME TO STUDY AND USE THIS INFORMATION. 
NGOUBEYOU NOTED THAT, WHILE THE COUNCIL IS NOT OBLIGED TO 
DEAL WITH PUBLIC OPINION, IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THE ISSUE OF 
IRAQ HAD BECOME A HIGH PROFILE ISSUE GLOBALLY. AT STAKE, HE 
SAID, WAS THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY 
AND THE RESPECT OF THE UN AS A WHOLE.  FOR THIS REASON, HE 
WAS CONVINCED, HE SAID, THAT THE U.S. AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WOULD PROCEED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE UN CHARTER AND 
WOULD SOLVE THIS ISSUE THROUGH THE COUNCIL.  NGOUBEYOU ALSO 
RECOMMENDED THAT, GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE, THE SYG BE 
ASKED TO GO TO IRAQ TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE IRAQIS, IN ORDER TO 
ALLOW A SPEEDY RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  DESPITE THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, HE CLAIMED, WAR WAS NOT 
INEVITABLE. 
 
ANGOLA: COMPELLING INTELLIGENCE 
-------------------------------- 
 
22. (U) ANGOLAN DFM CHIKOTY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S INITIATIVE TO SEND SECRETARY POWELL TO THE 
COUNCIL, \"TO SHARE WITH US THE COMPELLING INTELLIGENCE JUST 
SEEN.\"  FOR TWENTY YEARS, IRAQ HAD BEEN AT THE CENTER OF THE 
WORLD\'S SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE JANUARY 27 REPORT TO THE 
COUNCIL, WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PRESENTATION BY THE U.S., 
ENABLED THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO TAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. 
THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TODAY BROUGHT NEW ELEMENTS, WHICH 
MUST BE ADDRESSED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL.  THE IMPORTANCE OF INSPECTORS SHOULD NOT BE 
MINIMIZED, AS ONLY THROUGH COOPERATION WITH THEM COULD IRAQ 
PROVE ITSELF READY TO EMBARK ON A DISARMAMENT PROGRAM. 
COUNTRIES SHOULD URGENTLY PURSUE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO 
UNMOVIC, HE ADDED.  PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE, 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD NOT EXHAUSTED ALL THE 
OPTIONS BEFORE RESORTING TO WAR, HE CONCLUDED. 
 
GUINEA: LIFT SANCTIONS TO INDUCE IRAQI COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
23.  (U)  GUINEAN PERMREP TRAORE, SPEAKING IN THE ABSENCE OF 
HIS FOREIGN MINISTER, PRAISED THE SECRETARY\'S INITIATIVE IN 
MAKING HIS PRESENTATION.  HE SAID THAT THE JANUARY 27 BLIX 
/EL-BARADEI PRESENTATION REVEALED SOME IMPROVEMENT IN IRAQI 
COOPERATION, YET CLEARLY THERE WERE SUBSTANTIVE DEFICITS. 
IRAQ MUST OFFER COGENT EVIDENCE ON THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS 
WMD, ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INTERVIEWS WITH SCIENTISTS, PROVIDE A 
CREDIBLE UPDATED LIST OF SCIENTISTS, AND AUTHORIZE U-2 
OVERFLIGHTS.  ITS PAST FAILURE TO COOPERATE  DEMONSTRATED 
THAT THE COUNCIL COULD NOT  ACCEPT MERE WORDS.  LIFTING 
SANCTIONS, HE SUGGESTED, WOULD ENCOURAGE IRAQI COOPERATION. 
 
 
IRAQ SPEAKS LAST 
---------------- 
 
24.  (U) IRAQI PERMREP AL-DOURI COMPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT 
HAVE EQUAL TIME TO REBUT THE U.S. PRESENTATION, WHICH HE 
DECRIED AS \"UTTERLY UNRELATED TO THE TRUTH.\"  THE SECRETARY 
HAD PRESENTED NO NEW INFORMATION, MERELY SOUND RECORDINGS 
WHOSE AUTHENTICITY COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED, HE ASSERTED.  HE 
AVERRED THAT THE SOLE AIM OF THE U.S. WAS TO JUSTIFY WAR; BUT 
IRAQ IS WMD-FREE, AS NUMEROUS IRAQI OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATED 
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.  MOREOVER, THE SECRETARY SHOULD HAVE 
SPARED HIMSELF THE EFFORT OF APPEARING BEFORE THE COUNCIL BY 
TAKING THE PRESENTATION DIRECTLY TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA, IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH OP10 OF UNSCR 1441, THUS ALLOWING THE 
INSPECTORS TO \"PROCEED WITH THEIR WORK IN PEACE AND QUIET.\" 
THE FEBRUARY 8-9 VISIT TO IRAQ BY BLIX AND EL-BARADEI OFFERED 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE U.S. 
ALLEGATIONS, HE ADDED, CLAIMING THAT THE INSPECTORS HAD 
PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THE \"FALSITY\" OF U.S. AND UK 
ALLEGATIONS.  AS PROOF OF IRAQI COOPERATION, HE REFERRED TO 
IRAQ\'S 12,000 PAGE DECEMBER 7 DECLARATION, THE PRESENCE OF 
MORE THAN 250 INSPECTORS IN IRAQ, AND THE 575 INSPECTIONS 
COMPLETED AT MORE THAN 300 SITES AS OF FEBRUARY 4.  UNMOVIC 
AND IAEA ANALYSES HAD CONFIRMED THE ABSENCE OF ANY PROSCRIBED 
WMD AGENTS, HE STATED.  MOREOVER, BLIX HAD NOT FOUND ANY 
EVIDENCE OF MOBILE LABS AND BLIX HAD DISCOUNTED THE ASSERTION 
THAT IRAQI AGENTS WERE POSING AS SCIENTISTS IN A NEW YORK 
TIMES PIECE PUBLISHED ON JANUARY 30, HE ADDED.  IRAQ HAD NO 
OBJECTION TO U-2 OVERFLIGHTS IN PRINCIPLE;  HOWEVER, THESE 
COULD NOT GO FORWARD UNTIL THE U.S. AND UK SUSPENDED THEIR 
\"ILLEGAL\" NO-FLY ZONES. 
 
25.  (U)  AL-DOURI REJECTED U.S. EVIDENCE OF IRAQI 
CONCEALMENT AND TRUCK TRANSPORTATION OF INCRIMINATING 
MATERIALS PRIOR TO INSPECTIONS, DECLARING THAT INSPECTIONS 
WERE TAKING PLACE WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING.  MOREOVER, 
UNMOVIC, THANKS TO ITS HELICOPTERS AND OTHER RESOURCES, WAS 
TOO WELL-INFORMED FOR SUCH ALLEGED CONCEALMENT TO ELUDE 
NOTICE, HE SAID.  WMD PROGRAMS \"WERE NOT ASPIRIN PILLS THAT 
COULD BE EASILY HIDDEN.\"  ON THE CONTRARY, THE U.S. EVIDENCE 
\"COULD EASILY BE FABRICATED.\"  AL-DOURI REPUDIATED ANY 
LINKAGE BETWEEN IRAQ AND AL-QAEDA, CITING NEW YORK TIMES 
REPORTING ON COMPLAINTS BY CIA ANALYSTS THAT THE U.S. 
EXAGGERATED EVIDENCE ON AL-QAEDA TO BOLSTER ITS CASE FOR WAR. 
 SIMILARLY, HE ACCUSED FM STRAW OF WILLFULLY IGNORING UK 
ANALYSIS CASTING DOUBTS ON A LINKAGE TO AL-QAEDA.   AGAIN 
QUOTING THE NEW YORK TIMES,  HE ASSERTED THAT THE USG HAD 
KNOWN, SINCE 1988, THAT IRAQ HAD NOT, IN FACT, DEPLOYED 
CHEMICAL AGENTS. THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WAS DESIGNED TO 
SELL U.S. AND WORLD PUBLIC OPINION ON THE CASE FOR WAR IN THE 
ABSENCE OF CONVINCING LEGAL, MORAL, OR POLITICAL 
JUSTIFICATIONS, HE ALLEGED.  IRAQ, HOWEVER, OFFERED A PATH OF 
PEACE, HE CONCLUDED, APPENDING A LAST COMMENT THAT IT WAS 
ISRAEL THAT POSED THE REAL WMD THREAT IN THE REGION.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, UNSC, PARM, IZ 
SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: COUNCIL PRESS STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE 
SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION 
 
REF: USUN 299 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: COUNCIL MEMBERS, STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS 
FOLLOWING SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CLOSELY REFLECTED 
THE CONTENT OF THEIR PREPARED NATIONAL STATEMENTS MADE IN THE 
COUNCIL CHAMBER, AND LARGELY FELL ALONG PREDICTABLE LINES. 
WHEN ASKED IF SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONVINCED HIM 
OF ANYTHING, FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN RESPONDED THAT THE 
PRESENTATION CONTAINED \"NO ABSOLUTE PROOF, ONLY SUSPICIONS.\" 
CHINESE FM TANG STRESSED THAT INFORMATION FROM MEMBER STATES 
SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE INSPECTORS, WHO ARE THE APPROPRIATE 
AGENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANALYZING THIS INFORMATION.  GERMAN FM 
FISCHER RESPONDED TO MANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS-- 
INCLUDING ONE ON THE ILLEGAL EXPORT OF GERMAN GOODS TO IRAQ 
-- BY RECOMMENDING ONGOING, INCREASED AND STRENGTHENED 
INSPECTIONS.  BULGARIAN FM PASSY NOTED THAT THE RIFT BETWEEN 
THE U.S. AND SOME EUROPEAN STATES WAS DECREASING, WHILE THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR A UNANIMOUS SOLUTION WAS INCREASING.  SYRIAN 
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE WEHBE STATED THAT SECRETARY 
POWELL,S PRESENTATION WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD ABOUT 
ANY LINK BETWEEN IRAQ AND \"SO-CALLED\" TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND STATED THAT HE WAS PLEASED BY FISCHER,S 
\"PEACEFUL\" STATEMENT.  IRAQI PR AL-DOURI PRESENTED A PREPARED 
STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, AND NOTED THAT HE WOULD DEFER A MORE 
DETAILED REACTION PENDING THE PRESENTATION OF THE OFFICIAL 
GOI RESPONSE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. (COMMENT:  THE HEAVY 
RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY PREPARED TEXTS, EVEN IN ADDRESSING THE 
PRESS, SUGGESTED THAT DELEGATIONS HAD YET TO DETERMINE HOW TO 
RESPOND TO THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION. END COMMENT.)  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
FRANCE 
 
2. (U) FM DE VILLEPIN OF FRANCE THANKED SECRETARY POWELL FOR 
SHARING HIS INFORMATION AND \"SUSPICIONS,\" A TERM HE 
REPEATEDLY USED IN DESCRIBING THE CONTENT OF THE 
PRESENTATION.  VILLEPIN IS NOW EXPECTING ANSWERS FROM IRAQ, 
WHICH MUST ANSWER.  HE NOTED THAT FRANCE MUST COMPARE THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY POWELL WITH ITS OWN 
INTELLIGENCE.  VILLEPIN SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE 
INSPECTIONS, UNDER UNSCR 1441. REPEATING ELEMENTS OF HIS 
STATEMENTS TO THE COUNCIL (REFTEL), HE DEEMED THE COUNCIL 
COULD ASK MORE OF IRAQ, AS WELL AS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE 
NUMBER OF INSPECTORS, INCREASE THE INTELLIGENCE PROVIDED TO 
INSPECTORS, AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY FOR AERIAL OBSERVATION. 
ALL OF THIS WAS NECESSARY BEFORE RESORTING TO FORCE, HE SAID. 
ASKED IF SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONVINCED HIM IN 
ANY RESPECT, VILLEPIN RESPONDED THAT THE PRESENTATION 
CONTAINED \"NO ABSOLUTE PROOF, ONLY SUSPICIONS.\"  QUESTIONED 
FURTHER ABOUT IRAQ,S ONGOING DECEPTION, VILLEPIN STRESSED 
THAT THERE ARE INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, WHO ARE \"THE 
COUNCIL,S EYES AND EARS.\"  SO LONG AS INSPECTORS ARE \"IN A 
POSITION TO DO WORK, WE REMAIN IN THE FIRST PHASE\" OF 1441. 
IF THE SITUATION REACHES A DEADLOCK IN THE VIEW OF THE 
INSPECTORS, WHICH WILL BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH A REPORT, 
\"THEN WE WILL HAVE REACHED THE SECOND PHASE AND SHOULD BEGIN 
TO WORK ON A NEW RESOLUTION.\" 
 
3. (U) HE STATED THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A NEW UNSCR, GIVEN THE 
CONTINUED PRESENCE OF INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND. THE FM NOTED 
THAT EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE THROUGH 1441 AS LONG AS THERE IS 
PROGRESS, AND THAT THE FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL, \"NOT ANY ONE COUNTRY\" -- HAVE THE FULL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE THE PATH FORWARD.  QUESTIONED ON THE 
STATE OF THE FRENCH-AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP, HE NOTED THAT THE 
CENTURIES-OLD FRIENDSHIP OF THE TWO NATIONS EXISTS TODAY AND 
WOULD EXIST TOMORROW.   WHEN ASKED IF FRANCE WOULD COUNTER 
THE U.S., ONLY TO JOIN FORCES IN THE END, HE EXPRESSED A 
PREFERENCE FOR SOLIDARITY, YET EMPHASIZED ABOVE ALL THE CORE 
FUNCTION OF THE UN  IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATION. (COMMENT: 
VILLEPIN SEEMED ILL AT EASE, SOMEWHAT DEFENSIVE, AND 
GENERALLY UNPREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AT HAND.  HE 
EXPLICITLY IGNORED A PARTICULAR (UNIDENTIFIED) JOURNALIST WHO 
REPEATEDLY CALLED OUT A QUESTION ABOUT VILLEPIN\'S VIEWS OF 
WHETHER OR NOT IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH. END COMMENT.) 
 
CHINA 
 
4. (U) IN COMMENTS TO THE PRESS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY 
CONSISTENT WITH CHINA\'S PREVIOUS STATEMENT TO THE COUNCIL, 
CHINESE FM TANG WELCOMED SECRETARY POWELL,S INFORMATION AND 
EVIDENCE, WHICH HE FOUND CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
UNSCR 1441 AND THE NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY. THE 
STATEMENT REINFORCED HIS BELIEF THAT THE INSPECTIONS MUST 
CONTINUE.  HE STRESSED THAT INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF 
MEMBER STATES SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO THE INSPECTORS. TANG 
NOTED THAT IRAQI RESPONSE IS NOW CRITICAL, AND URGED ALL 
EFFORTS TO BE FOCUSED ON ENSURING AN IRAQI STATE WITHOUT 
WMD.   HE NOTED THAT WHILE THERE IS \"MUCH TALK OF WAR,\" CHINA 
STILL FAVORS A POLITICAL SOLUTION THROUGH THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL NO MATTER HOW LITTLE HOPE FOR PEACE REMAINS, AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TOWARD THIS 
END. 
 
GERMANY 
 
5. (U) GERMAN FM FISCHER STATED THAT THE SECRETARY,S 
PRESENTATION NEEDED CAREFUL EXAMINATION.  REFERRING TO SADDAM 
HUSSEIN\'S REGIME AS \"INHUMANE AND BRUTAL,\" HE NOTED THAT IRAQ 
MUST PROVIDE CLEAR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY BOTH THE 
SECRETARY AND DR. BLIX.  THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS WILL 
BE THE TRIP BY BLIX AND EL-BARADEI TO IRAQ, FOLLOWED BY AN 
UPDATE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  FISCHER SAID THE DANGEROUS 
CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION WERE CLEAR, AND HE ARGUED 
THAT INSPECTIONS REQUIRED MORE TIME.  INSPECTIONS, HE SAID, 
SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO \"GUARANTEE FULL AND 
LASTING DISARMAMENT.\"  HE SAW \"THE FRENCH PROPOSAL\" 
(PRESUMABLY REFERRING TO AUGMENTING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS 
AND OTHER INSPECTIONS CAPACITY) AS \"INTERESTING AND WORTH 
CONSIDERATION.\"  IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY ABOUT IRAQ,S ONGOING 
DECEPTION OF INSPECTORS, FISCHER CALLED THE INSPECTIONS TEAMS 
\"VERY IMPORTANT\" AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED 
INSPECTIONS.  FISCHER DECLINED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER IRAQ WAS 
IN MATERIAL BREACH, TRYING TO SIDESTEP THE QUESTION BY 
EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE WAS NOT AN 
INTELLIGENCE EXPERT AND THAT \"EXPERTS MUST DECIDE.\"  PRESSED 
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WAS A POLITICAL AND NOT AN INTELLIGENCE 
DECISION, FISCHER ALLOWED THAT IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION 
THAT HAD TO BE BASED ON FACT.  PRESSED ON PAST ILLEGAL 
EXPORTS TO IRAQ BY GERMAN NATIONALS, FISCHER JUDGED SUCH 
CASES TO BE \"IN THE PAST,\" NOTING SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN 
GERMAN EXPORT REGULATIONS.  HE STATED THAT A STRENGTHENED 
INSPECTIONS REGIME WOULD FURTHER HINDER REPETITION OF SUCH 
INFRACTIONS.  (COMMENT:  PERHAPS REFLECTING THE CONVICTION OF 
GERMANY\'S POSITION, FISCHER\'S DELIVERY, PARTICULARLY AS 
COMPARED TO VILLEPIN\'S, WAS SMOOTH AND DELIBERATE.  DESPITE 
APPEARING COLLECTED, HE WAS NONETHELESS PUT ON THE DEFENSIVE 
BY A NUMBER OF THE TOUGHER QUESTIONS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
BULGARIA 
 
6. (U) BULGARIAN FM PASSY OPENED HIS STATEMENT BY SHARING HIS 
BELIEF THAT THERE IS STILL A CHANCE FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION 
BASED ON PRODUCTIVE COOPERATION.  HE ASSERTED THAT, ALTHOUGH 
STILL PRESENT, THE \"DIFFERENCES\" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOME 
EUROPEAN STATES WERE DECREASING, WHILE THE CHANCES OF FINDING 
A SOLUTION UNANIMOUSLY ARE INCREASING.  IN RESPONSE TO A 
QUERY, HE NOTED THAT A NEW RESOLUTION WAS NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION.  PASSY WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT BULGARIA,S ABSENCE 
FROM THE DECLARATION OF EUROPEAN STATES SUPPORTING THE U.S., 
TO WHICH HE RESPONDED BY NOTING HIS NATION,S SUPPORT OF THE 
DECLARATION AND STATED THAT BULGARIA JOINS THE COMMON 
DEMARCHE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE EU.  FM PASSY SAID 
SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONTAINED \"VERY CONVINCING 
ARGUMENTS, FOR WMD, FOR TERRORISM, FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\" SAYING 
HE FELT MORE HOPEFUL NOW THAN HE DID ON HIS FLIGHT FROM 
SOFIA. IN CLOSING, HE MENTIONED THAT IRAQ COULD STILL BE 
GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO HELP FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. 
 
SYRIA 
 
7. (U) SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE NOTED THAT HE HAD LISTENED TO 
SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION AND WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE 
\"PEACEFUL TUNE (SIC)\" EXPRESSED BY FISCHER, WHICH CAPTURED 
THE FEELING OF \"MOST MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.\"  HE STRESSED 
THAT THE COUNCIL MUST BE THE CENTER OF ANY SOLUTION AND THIS 
SOLUTION MUST BE FOCUSED ON PEACEFUL MEANS.  HE URGED THAT 
ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY POWELL BE GIVEN 
TO IAEA AND UNMOVIC FOR ANALYSIS.  WEHBE NOTED THAT MANY 
MINISTERS ELABORATED ON THE \"DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES\" WAR 
WOULD HAVE ON THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND THE REGION, AND STATED 
THAT WAR WOULD REPRESENT A FAILURE BY THE COUNCIL AND THE 
WORLD ORDER TO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER.  HE 
SAID THAT IRAQ SHOULD COOPERATE FULLY AND PROACTIVELY, NOTING 
STATEMENTS BY HIGH LEVEL IRAQI OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT 
THEY WERE \"VERY READY TO COOPERATE,\" AS WELL AS THEIR 
INVITATION TO HAVE BLIX AND EL-BARADEI BACK TO BAGHDAD ON 8 
FEBRUARY.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD, \"BEFORE OR 
NOW,\" OF A LINK BETWEEN IRAQ AND \"SO-CALLED\" TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS.  HE CITED \"A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE TWO DAYS 
AGO THAT WE ALL HAVE SEEN\" THAT SHOWED THE U.S. LACKED 
EVIDENCE LINKING IRAQ TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  HE ALSO 
ASSERTED THAT A UK STATEMENT FROM FEBRUARY 5 ACKNOWLEDGED THE 
ABSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE LINKING IRAQ TO TERRORISM.  WHEN 
ASKED IF IRAQ WAS CURRENTLY IN MATERIAL BREACH, WEHBE SIMPLY 
WALKED AWAY FROM THE PODIUM. 
 
IRAQ 
 
8. (U) IRAQI PERMREP AL-DOURI ARRIVED WITH A PREPARED 
STATEMENT.  HE REMARKED THAT SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION 
DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS.  HE STATED THAT COUNCIL 
MEMBERS HAD MADE CLEAR THAT ANY INFORMATION SHOULD BE 
PROVIDED TO THE INSPECTORS AND THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE 
SUCCESSFUL AND WORKING.  FOR THIS REASON, HE CONTINUED, OTHER 
MEANS TO DISARM THEM SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.  HE CALLED 
SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION \"A SET OF ACCUSATIONS EASILY 
REFUTED,\" AND IN CLOSING SAID THAT IRAQ WOULD CONTINUE WITH 
THE INSPECTIONS IN A PROACTIVE MANNER.  (COMMENT:  AL-DOURI 
WAS FAIRLY CUT AND DRIED, DEFLECTING PRESS INTEREST BY 
TELLING THE ASSEMBLED STAKEOUT TO WATCH THE LIVE PRESS FEED 
FROM BAGHDAD LATER IN THE AFTERNOON.  END COMMENT.)

LEGITIMACY OF ACTION WITHOUT UNSCR 
 
1. (U) SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN, IN THE HAGUE MARCH 10 FOR 
CYPRUS UNIFICATION TALKS, ADDRESSED THE PRESS ON IRAQ.  WHEN 
ASKED IF AN ATTACK ON IRAQ WITHOUT SECURITY COUNCIL 
AUTHORIZATION WOULD VIOLATE THE UN CHARTER, ANNAN SAID \"IF 
THE U.S. AND OTHERS WERE TO GO OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL AND TAKE 
MILITARY ACTION, IT WOULD NOT BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE 
CHARTER.\" ANNAN SAID PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WANT A PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS, AND EMPHASIZED THAT \"WAR MUST 
ALWAYS BE A LAST RESORT.\" HE NOTED THAT THE UN HAS \"A DUTY TO 
SEARCH UNTIL THE VERY END FOR THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF 
CONFLICTS.\" 
 
2. (U) ANNAN NOTED THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS \"NOW 
FACE A MOMENTOUS CHOICE,\" ADDING, \"IF THEY FAIL TO AGREE ON A 
COMMON POSITION, AND ACTION IS TAKEN WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE LEGITIMACY AND SUPPORT FOR ANY SUCH 
ACTION WILL BE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED.\"  HE CONTINUED, ADDING 
THAT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WOULD CRUCIALLY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH OTHER 
PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND AFRICA. 
 ANNAN ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED THE WORLD OVER TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE UN, AND SAID, \"AS THEY APPROACH 
THEIR GRAVE DECISION, I MUST SOLEMNLY URGE ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
COUNCIL TO KEEP THIS IN MIND, AND TO BE WORTHY OF THE TRUST 
IN THEM THAT THE WORLD\'S PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN.\"

REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) IN A DISPLAY OF THE INCREASING DISCOMFORT WITH THE 
DECISION BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON IRAQ, THE UNDECIDED SIX (U-6) 
HAVE PREPARED A \"COMPROMISE PROPOSAL\" WHICH THEY PLAN TO PUT 
BEFORE THE COUNCIL.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHEN THIS DRAFT (TEXT AT 
PARA 2), WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY A FRIENDLY U-6 MEMBER, WILL BE 
INTRODUCED.  ALONG WITH THIS DRAFT, THE U-6 IS ALSO 
CONSIDERING OTHER IDEAS BORNE OF DESPERATION, SUCH AS HAVING 
THE VOTING ORDER IN THE COUNCIL REVISED TO ALLOW THE \"NO\'S\" 
TO VOTE FIRST. 
 
2. (C) HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DRAFT INCLUDE: THE PRESENTATION OF A 
WORK PROGRAM, DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES, NO LATER THAN MARCH 
17. THIS IDEA, INTRODUCED IN OP2, INCLUDES ARTICULATING KEY 
REMAINING DISARMAMENT TASKS (KRDTS) IN THE FIRST PHASE. OP3 
REQUESTS BIWEEKLY REPORTS VIA THE COLLEGE OF COMMISSIONERS. 
OP4 SETS A \"FINAL REPORT\" DATE OF APRIL 17, APPARENTLY 
CONTAINING KRDTS FROM PHASE I OF THE WORK PROGRAM, AT WHICH 
POINT THE COUNCIL WOULD INITIATE PHASE II OF THE WORK 
PROGRAM, WHICH WOULD APPARENTLY CONTAIN ADDITIONAL KRDTS. OP4 
ALSO HAS A HIDDEN TRIGGER AT THE END IN THAT THE COUNCIL CAN 
DECIDE ON APRIL 17 THAT IRAQ HAS FAILED TO TAKE ITS FINAL 
OPPORTUNITY. OP6 CONTAINS AN OFFER OF FULL AMNESTY FOR 
COOPERATIVE IRAQI OFFICIALS, AN IDEA TAKEN FROM AN EARLIER 
PAKISTANI RESOLUTION. 
 
2. (C)BEGIN TEXT OF U-6 \"COMPROMISE PROPOSAL\" OPERATIVE 
PARAGRAPHS ONLY. 
 
(THE SECURITY COUNCIL) ACTING UNDER CHAPTER VII OF THE 
CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 
 
1. REAFFIRMS THE NEED FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 
1441; 
 
2. DECIDES THAT UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA, NOT LATER THAN 17 MARCH 
WILL EACH SUBMIT, FOR APPROVAL BY THE COUNCIL, A WORK PROGRAM 
FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR MANDATES AS REQUESTED BY 
RESOLUTION 1284, WHICH WILL BE DIVIDED IN TWO PHASES TO 
INCLUDE IN THE FIRST PHASE CLEARLY DEFINED AND PRECISE KEY 
DISARMAMENT TASKS THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLETE NO LATER THAN 
APRIL 17; 
 
3. REQUESTS THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA TO 
PRESENT BI-WEEKLY REPORTS, THROUGH THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, TO 
THE COUNCIL, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSIONERS, 
ON THE WORK OF UNMOVIC, AS WELL AS ON THE COOPERATION AND 
COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ OF THE TASKS INCLUDED IN PHASE ONE OF THE 
WORK PROGRAM; 
 
4. REQUESTS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
TO PRESENT A FINAL REPORT ON THE FIRST PHASE OF THE WORK 
PROGRAM BY APRIL 17 ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE COUNCIL WILL 
DECIDE TO INITIATE PHASE TWO OF THE WORK PROGRAM CONTAINING 
THE ADDITIONAL KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLY 
OR THE COUNCIL WILL DECIDE THAT IRAQ HAS FAILED TO TAKE THE 
FINAL OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY RESOLUTION 1441; 
 
5. CALLS UPON IRAQ TO FULFILL THE OUTSTANDING DISARMAMENT 
TASKS AS IDENTIFIED IN PHASE ONE OF THE WORK PROGRAM AND ITS 
OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND TO EXTEND, 
IMMEDIATE, FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION TO THE UN 
INSPECTORS TO SECURE THE OBJECTIVE OF DISARMAMENT OF ITS WMD 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTION 1441; 
 
6. DECLARES A FULL AMNESTY FOR ALL IRAQI OFFICIALS WHO EXTEND 
THEIR FULL AND UNEQUIVOCAL COOPERATION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
AND OTHER UN AGENCIES AND TO THE UNSC TO SECURE FULL AND 
FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED 
OBLIGATIONS AND ASSURES THEM OF PROTECTION AND SECURITY FOR 
THE PERSON AND THEIR FAMILIES; 
 
7. DECIDES TO REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER.

REF: USUN 699 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; REASONS: 
 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU REPORTED THAT THE 
U-6 INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FOR THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL HAD HIT A DEAD END, BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF 
A MEETING BETWEEN U-6 PERMREPS EARLY AFTERNOON ON MARCH 14. 
CAMEROON, ANGOLA, GUINEA AND PAKISTAN HAD ALL DECLINED TO 
SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE FURTHER, BUT AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD 
CIRCULATE THE FINAL DOCUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE 
RECORD.  CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES REPORTED SEPARATELY TO 
AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THAT THE SIX HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND 
A SUFFICIENT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE COMPETING POSITIONS IN THE 
COUNCIL. 
 
2. (U) THE TEXT OF THE FINAL U-6 PRODUCT FOLLOWS.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT 
 
1. THE SECURITY COUNCIL RECALLS ITS RESOLUTION 687 (1991) AND 
OTHER RELEVANT RESOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY RESOLUTIONS 1284 
(1999) AND 1441 (2002) WHICH ESTABLISHED AN ENHANCED SYSTEM 
OF INSPECTIONS BASED ON IMMEDIATE, ACTIVE, FULL AND 
UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION OF IRAQ, TO COMPLETE VERIFIED 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ AND THE REPORTS OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE UNMOVIC AND IAEA ON JANUARY 27TH, FEBRUARY 14TH AND 
7TH, 2003. 
 
2. THE BRIEFINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA INDICATED PROGRESS IN THE DISARMAMENT PROCESS OF IRAQ 
AND UNDERLINED THAT RESULTS ARE STILL MODEST AND THE NEED FOR 
FURTHER ENDEAVORS TO COMPLETE VERIFIED DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE COUNCIL HAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 
INSPECTIONS CANNOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY (THIS SITUATION 
CREATED DIFFERENT OPINIONS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE SC ON HOW 
TO BEST ACHIEVE IRAQ\'S DISARMAMENT.) THUS, THE COUNCIL WILL 
NEED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSPECTIONS AS A MEANS 
TO OBTAIN, IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, THE COMPLETE AND 
VERIFIABLE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. 
 
3. TO THIS END: 
 
ON THE BASIS OF THE RECENT REPORT OF CLUSTERS DECLASSIFIED BY 
UNMOVIC, THE COUNCIL HAS DECIDED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE 
NEED FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF RES. 1441. THE COUNCIL 
DECIDES THAT: IRAQ SHOULD, NO LATER THAN (  ) AFTER THE 
ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT PRST, COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING 
IMMEDIATE DISARMAMENT TASKS: 
 
A) AUTHORIZATION TO INTERVIEW AT LEAST 30 SCIENTISTS 
IDENTIFIED BY UNMOVIC AND IAEA OUTSIDE IRAQ. 
B) DISCLOSURE OF ANY MUSTARD GAS FILLED SHELLS AND AERIAL 
BOMBS UNACCOUNTED FOR SINCE 1998 OR EVIDENCE OF THEIR 
DESTRUCTION AS DEMANDED BY THE INSPECTORS; 
C) DISCLOSE INFORMATION ON 10,000 LITERS OF ANTHRAX 
UNACCOUNTED FOR AS DEMANDED BY THE INSPECTORS; 
D) DESTROY ALL AL SAMOUD MISSILES AND COMPONENTS, INCLUDING 
WARHEADS, LAUNCHERS, SA-2 MISSILE ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT AND 
COMPONENTS DESIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION AND TESTING OF AL 
SAMOUD 2 MISSILES. 
E) PROVIDE FULL DOCUMENTATION ON THE PURPOSE OF THE REMOTELY 
PILOTED VEHICLES (RPVS). 
F) ADOPT LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE WMD PRODUCTION AND 
RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR ALL IRAQI GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND 
CITIZENS IMMEDIATELY; 
 
(IN ANY CASE, AND AS A STARTING POINT OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE 
LEADERSHIP OF IRAQ MUST WRITE A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE 
SECRETARY-GENERAL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 
INDICATING THAT IRAQ WILL WITHOUT DELAY YIELD TO UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA FOR DESTRUCTION OF ALL REMAINING PROHIBITED WEAPONS, 
PROSCRIBED ITEMS AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN DATA. IRAQ WILL 
FULLY COOPERATE WITH UNMOVIC AND IAEA IN IMMEDIATELY 
ADDRESSING AND RESOLVING ALL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. THE 
LETTER SHOULD ALSO INDICATE THE APPROPRIATE MEANS TO BE USED 
SO THAT THE FOLLOWING BECOMES THE DUTY OF ALL IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND CITIZENS IMMEDIATELY: 
 
-TO CEASE ANY PROSCRIBED ACTIVITY 
-TO HAND OVER ANY PROSCRIBED ITEMS OR DOCUMENTATION AND DATA 
ABOUT SUCH ITEMS IN THEIR POSSESSION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA.) 
 
4. UPON EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD ...., THE INSPECTORS WILL 
PRESENT A FACTUAL AND DETAILED REPORT ON THE COMPLETION OF 
THE DISARMAMENT TASKS MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH 3. THE COUNCIL 
WILL THEN ASSESS THE SITUATION AND DECIDE THE CONTINUATION OF 
THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS ON THE BASIS OF A PROGRAM OF WORK TO 
BE SUBMITTED BY THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA OR 
APPLY THE APPROPRIATE RELEVANT PARAGRAPH OF 1441. 
 
5. THE COUNCIL OFFERS FULL PROTECTION FOR ALL IRAQI OFFICIALS 
WHO EXTEND THEIR UNEQUIVOCAL COOPERATION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
AND OTHER UN AGENCIES AND TO THE UNSC TO SECURE FULL AND 
FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED 
OBLIGATIONS AND ASSURES THEM OF SECURITY FOR THEIR PERSON AND 
THEIR FAMILIES. 
 
6. WITHIN THE TIME FRAME MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH ... THE 
COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE INTENSE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE 
IRAQ\'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS STATEMENT. 
 
7. THE COUNCIL SHALL REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER.

DECLARATION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, 
REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (U) ON MARCH 15, GERMAN PERMREP PLEUGER CIRCULATED THE 
FOLLOWING GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT DECLARATION ON 
IRAQ AS AN ANNEX TO A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL. 
 
2. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT 
DECLARATION. 
 
-- THE SHARED GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ PURSUANT TO THE DECISIONS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.  SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 
(2002), ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY, PROVIDES FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED 
INSPECTIONS REGIME. 
 
-- WE REAFFIRM THAT NOTHING IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
JUSTIFIES ABANDONING THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS OR RESORTING TO 
FORCE. 
 
-- THE SUCCESSIVE REPORTS OF MR. HANS BLIX AND MR. MOHAMED 
ELBARADEI HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE PRODUCING 
RESULTS.  THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ HAS BEGUN, AND THERE IS 
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE COMPLETED RAPIDLY AND 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES SET OUT BY THE COUNCIL.  IRAQ, 
FOR ITS PART, MUST COOPERATE ACTIVELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. 
 
-- FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, SUPPORTED BY 
CHINA, HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS FOR ACHIEVING THAT OBJECTIVE 
BY DEFINING KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISHING A RIGOROUS 
TIMETABLE. 
 
-- SUGGESTIONS IN THE SAME SPIRIT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.  THE UNITY OF THE COUNCIL CAN 
BE PRESERVED ON THE BASIS OF THESE EFFORTS, IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY RESOLUTION 1441 (2002). 
ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL BEAR A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR ENSURING THAT IT IS NOT DIVIDED AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME. 
 
-- THE PROGRAMME OF WORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS MONITORING, 
VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION COMMISSION (UNMOVIC) IS TO BE 
SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL ON TUESDAY.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD THEN MEET AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL TO APPROVE 
KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISH AN IMPLEMENTATION 
TIMETABLE WHICH IS BOTH DEMANDING AND REALISTIC. 
 
-- THE USE OF FORCE CAN BE ONLY A LAST RESORT.  A PEACEFUL 
APPROACH IS PREFERRED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND SUPPORTED 
BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; WE 
SOLEMNLY APPEAL TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TO MAKE EVERY 
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SUCH AN APPROVAL PREVAILS.

SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: ELEMENTS OF UK/U.S./SPAIN STATEMENT ON IRAQ 
 
1. (U) IN COMMENTS TO THE PRESS BEFORE INFORMAL 
CONSULTATIONS, MARCH 17, UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK, ACCOMPANIED 
BY SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS AND AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE, ISSUED A 
JOINT STATEMENT ON IRAQ. FOLLOWING GREENSTOCK\'S COMMENTS, 
AMBASSADORS NEGROPONTE AND ARIAS PROVIDED STATEMENTS TO THE 
PRESS. 
 
 
ELEMENTS OF UK/U.S./SPAIN STATEMENT ON IRAQ AS PRESENTED BY 
UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
2. (U) AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD IN THE LAST FEW 
DAYS IN A FINAL EFFORT TO SEEK A COUNCIL CONSENSUS ON IRAQ. 
IN AN EFFORT TO REUNITE THE COUNCIL, THE UNITED KINGDOM 
PROPOSED LAST WEEK AN ULTIMATUM WHICH WOULD CHALLENGE IRAQ TO 
TAKE A STRATEGIC DECISION TO DISARM. 
 
THERE WERE THREE KEY ELEMENTS TO THE COMPROMISE WE PROPOSED: 
 
-TOUGH BUT REALIZABLE TESTS, INCLUDING AN UNEQUIVOCAL 
COMMITMENT TO DISARMAMENT BY SADDAM HUSSEIN; 
 
-A REALISTIC BUT TIGHT TIMETABLE FOR COMPLETION OF THOSE 
TESTS GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR IRAQ TO COMPLY AFTER 12 YEARS 
OF PREVARICATION; 
 
-AND, THIRD, AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IF IRAQ FAILED THE TESTS, 
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WOULD ENSUE AS SET OUT IN RESOLUTION 
1441. 

HAVING HELD FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNCIL MEMBERS OVER THE 
WEEKEND AND IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, WE HAVE HAD TO CONCLUDE 
THAT COUNCIL CONSENSUS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN LINE WITH 
RESOLUTION 1441.  ONE COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR HAS UNDERLINED 
ITS INTENTION TO VETO ANY ULTIMATUM \"NO MATTER WHAT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.\"  THAT COUNTRY REJECTED OUR PROPOSED 
COMPROMISE BEFORE EVEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND HAS 
PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD ROW BACK ON THE UNANIMOUS 
AGREEMENT OF THE COUNCIL IN 1441 - THOSE SUGGESTIONS WOULD 
AMOUNT TO NO ULTIMATUM/NO PRESSURE/NO DISARMAMENT; 
 
GIVEN THIS SITUATION, WE HAVE AGREED THAT WE WILL NOT PURSUE 
A VOTE ON THE DRAFT UK/U.S./SPANISH RESOLUTION IN BLUE; 
 
THE COMMUNIQUES AND PRESS STATEMENTS THAT WERE ISSUED AT THE 
AZORES SUMMIT EXPLAIN THE POSITION OF OUR GOVERNMENTS ON THE 
WAY FORWARD.  THE CO-SPONSORS RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE 
THEIR OWN STEPS TO SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. 
 
 
TRANSCRIPT OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE\'S COMMENTS TO THE PRESS 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
3. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:  GOOD MORNING.  CAN YOU HEAR 
ME?  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ASSOCIATE OURSELVES FULLY 
WITH THE STATEMENT MADE BY AMBASSADOR GREENSTOCK. 
 
I WOULD JUST MAKE THE FURTHER POINT THAT IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 
FOUR AND HALF MONTHS SINCE THE COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED 
RESOLUTION 1441, WHICH FOUND IRAQ IN MATERIAL BREACH AND GAVE 
IT A FINAL OPPORTUNITY TO DISARM OR FACE SERIOUS 
CONSEQUENCES. 

THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO COMPLY. OUR 
GOVERNMENTS BELIEVE THAT THROUGH ACTS OF OMISSION AND 
COMMISSION IRAQ IS NOW IN FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH. 
 
WE ADVOCATED A SECOND RESOLUTION BECAUSE A UNITED COUNCIL 
WOULD HAVE SHOWN IT WAS INTENT ON ENFORCING RESOLUTION 1441 
AND DISARMING IRAQ. WE BELIEVE THAT THE VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CLOSE. WE REGRET THAT IN THE FACE OF AN EXPLICIT THREAT TO 
VETO BY A PERMANENT MEMBER, THE VOTE COUNTING BECAME A 
SECONDARY CONSIDERATION.  THANK YOU. 
 
 
LAST OPPORTUNITY WAS SURRENDERED 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) IN HIS COMMENTS TO THE PRESS, SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS 
STATED THAT UNSCR 1441 WAS QUITE CLEAR IN PARAGRAPH FOUR, 
WHICH ESTABLISHED IN AN UNEQUIVOCAL WAY THAT ANY FALSE 
STATEMENT OR OMISSION ON THE PART OF IRAQ WOULD CONSTITUTE A 
FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH. ARIAS ADDED THAT IRAQ HAD BEEN GIVEN 
ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY, WHICH IT SURRENDERED.

TAGS: PREL, UNSC, IZ 
SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: NO VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION; SUBDUED COUNCIL 
 
REF: A. USUN 716 
     B. USUN 637 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; REASONS: 
 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A SUBDUED SECURITY COUNCIL MET IN INFORMALS 
ON MARCH 17 TO RECEIVE WORD THAT THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN HAD 
CHOSEN NOT TO BRING THEIR RESOLUTION TO A VOTE, BUT WOULD 
INSTEAD \"RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE THEIR OWN STEPS TO 
SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ.\" SYG ANNAN AND MOST COUNCIL 
MEMBERS EXPRESSED SADNESS AND FRUSTRATION THAT A COMPROMISE 
COULD NOT BE REACHED.  UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX 
ANNOUNCED THE UNMOVIC WORK PROGRAM WITH ITS KEY REMAINING 
DISARMAMENT TASKS (KRDTS) WOULD BE READY THE AFTERNOON OF 
MARCH 17.  ANNAN ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL UN 
OPERATIONS IN IRAQ AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL UN PERSONNEL. 
RUSSIA, DRAWING FROM THE MARCH 15 RUSSIAN - FRENCH - GERMAN 
DECLARATION (REF A), PUSHED FOR A COUNCIL MEETING ON 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, TO DISCUSS APPROVAL OF THE WORK PROGRAM 
AND KRDTS.  MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS (EVEN THE THREE AFRICAN 
STATES WHOSE FMS WILL BE IN NEW YORK ON TUESDAY, MARCH 18 FOR 
AN UNRELATED MEETING) HEDGED ON MINISTERIAL ATTENDANCE.  THE 
RUSSIANS MAY CONTINUE TO PROBE FOR POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC 
AREAS, BUT HAVE NOT AS YET SURFACED A RESOLUTION PUSHING FOR 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT THE WORK PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION, 
RUSSIAN PERMREP LAVROV SEEMED RESIGNED TO THE REALITY OF THE 
SITUATION, AND SOUGHT TO MINIMIZE DIFFERENCES, UNLIKE HIS 
FRENCH AND GERMAN COLLEAGUES. 
 
2. (C) GERMAN AND FRENCH PERMREPS BOTH PUSHED BACK ON THE 
U.S. - UK - SPANISH EXPLANATION REGARDING THE DRAFT 
RESOLUTION, ASSERTING THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 
BACKING FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL, AND MEXICAN PERMREP 
AGUILAR-ZINSER OUTLINED (AGAIN) MEXICO\'S POSITION THAT USE OF 
FORCE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION WAS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL 
LAW.  CHILE WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS UNHELPFUL, ASSERTING THAT 
INSPECTIONS WERE WORKING AND SHOULD BE CONTINUED; THE AFRICAN 
STATES COLLECTIVELY WERE LESS CONTENTIOUS, FOCUSING INSTEAD 
ON THE FAILURE OF THE COUNCIL TO ACHIEVE UNITY.  FINALLY, 
PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM CAREFULLY AVOIDED SAYING MUCH THAT 
COULD BE INTERPRETED IN EITHER DIRECTION. COUNCIL MEMBERS ALL 
STOOD BEHIND SYG ANNAN\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW UN PERSONNEL, 
NOTING THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE IN THE INTEREST OF THEIR 
SAFETY.  LAVROV LAID A MARKER THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT 
\"SUPPORT\" THE SYG\'S DECISION BUT RATHER \"NOTED\" IT, AS THE 
PHRASEOLOGY TO BE USED IN ANY STATEMENT TO THE PRESS TO BE 
MADE BY THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT (GUINEA). END SUMMARY. 
 
 
UK: ACTION ON UNSCR IS OFF; IRAQ CAN STILL ACT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (C) AFTER ANNOUNCING TO THE PRESS THE CO-SPONSORS\' 
DECISION NOT TO CALL FOR A VOTE ON THEIR DRAFT RESOLUTION 
(REF B), UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK CONVEYED THE SAME MESSAGE IN 
SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS.  HE SPECIFIED THAT THE 
CO-SPONSORS HAD NOT ACTUALLY WITHDRAWN IT AS HAD BEEN 
MISREPORTED IN THE PRESS.  HE REITERATED THAT THE RESOLUTION 
REMAINS ON THE TABLE. GREENSTOCK SAID THE UK HAD HELD 
INTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT COUNCIL 
CONSENSUS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IN LINE WITH RESOLUTION 1441. 
HE EXPLAINED THAT \"ONE COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR HAS UNDERLINED 
ITS INTENTION TO VETO ANY ULTIMATUM \'NO MATTER WHAT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.\'\"  GREENSTOCK CONTINUED THAT THAT COUNTRY 
(NOTE: FRANCE. END NOTE.) \"REJECTED OUR COMPROMISE PROPOSAL 
BEFORE EVEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND HAS PUT FORWARD 
SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD ROW BACK ON THE UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT OF 
THE COUNCIL IN 1441 - THOSE SUGGESTIONS WOULD AMOUNT TO NO 
ULTIMATUM, NO PRESSURE, AND NO DISARMAMENT.\"  HE SAID THAT 
\"THE CO-SPONSORS RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE THEIR OWN STEPS 
TO SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ.\" 
 
4. (C) GREENSTOCK SAID, IN THE VIEW OF HMG, IT WAS STILL 
POSSIBLE FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN TO DEMONSTRATE HE HAD MADE THE 
STRATEGIC DECISION TO DISARM AND CALLED FOR IRAQ TO TAKE THE 
APPROPRIATE STEPS.  HE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN UNMOVIC 
PRESENTING ITS WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS TO THE COUNCIL, SAYING 
THAT THE UK WAS OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ON ITS PROVISIONS. 
GREENSTOCK WARNED THAT ANY PROGRESS ON THE WORK PROGRAM OR 
THE KRDTS WAS PREDICATED ON OVERALL IRAQI COOPERATION.  HE 
SAID THAT THE UK ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD JUST RELEASED A RULING 
ON THE LEGALITY OF ACTION AGAINST IRAQ AND THAT THE UK 
MISSION WOULD DISTRIBUTE THAT RULING TO COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
GREENSTOCK RESERVED THE UK\'S POSITION ON ATTENDING THE 
PROPOSED MINISTERIAL BUT, IN THE EVENT FS STRAW DID COME, HE 
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ARRIVE UNTIL WEDNESDAY. 
 

U.S.: RESOLUTION IS OFF; UNMOVIC AND IAEA OUT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE SUPPORTED GREENSTOCK\'S 
EXPLANATION OF ACTION ON THE DRAFT RESOLUTION.  HE REGRETTED 
THAT, IN THE FACE OF A CERTAIN VETO THREAT, THAT THERE WAS NO 
PURPOSE IN PURSUING THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ANY FURTHER. 
 
6. (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THEN EXPLAINED CALLS HE AND 
OTHER USG OFFICIALS HAD MADE TO UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA ON MARCH 
16, SAYING THAT THE U.S. HAD PROMISED THE UN THAT IT WOULD 
PROVIDE ADVANCE WARNING WHEN IT WAS TIME TO WITHDRAW 
INSPECTORS FROM IRAQ.  HE SAID THE U.S. HAD ASKED THE WEAPONS 
INSPECTORS TO TAKE \"EXPEDITIOUS ACTION\" TO SUSPEND THEIR 
OPERATIONS IN IRAQ AND TO REMOVE ALL PERSONNEL FROM THE 
COUNTRY.  AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE SAID THAT THE WARNING DID NOT 
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WAR WAS IMMINENT, BUT THAT THE U.S. 
WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE FURTHER WARNINGS. 
 
 
BLIX: WORK PROGRAM READY; DETAILS ON WORK 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX EXPLAINED THAT COPIES 
OF THE DRAFT WORK PROGRAM WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE AFTERNOON 
OF MARCH 17.  BLIX REVIEWED THE REQUIREMENTS BEHIND THE WORK 
PROGRAM AND KRDTS, AND SAID THE \"CLUSTER\" DOCUMENT DELIVERED 
ON MARCH 7 HAD OUTLINED THE RANGE OF DISARMAMENT ISSUES.  THE 
WORK PROGRAM WOULD CONTAIN 12 KEY REMAINING DISARMAMENT 
TASKS, ALONG WITH DETAILS OF HOW UNMOVIC INTENDED TO GO ABOUT 
ITS WORK. 
 
8. (C) BLIX CONTRASTED THE KRDTS WITH VARIOUS COUNCIL 
\"BENCHMARK\" PROPOSALS, SAYING THAT UNMOVIC DID NOT USE THE 
TERM BENCHMARKS.  BLIX THOUGHT THE VALUE OF BENCHMARKS, SUCH 
AS THOSE PROPOSED LAST WEEK BY THE UK, RESIDED IN THEIR 
ABILITY TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AMONG THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT 
IRAQ\'S WMD PROGRAMS.   BLIX SAID UNMOVIC\'S ROLE IN A 
BENCHMARK-BASED EXERCISE WOULD BE TO REPORT BACK 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME.  HE ALSO CLARIFIED 
THAT DISCUSSION OF A 120-DAY TIME PERIOD FOR UNMOVIC REFERRED 
TO UNSCR 1284-BASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND WAS NOT 
NECESSARILY LINKED TO THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO DISARM IRAQ, 
WHICH HE REPEATED WOULD TAKE \"NOT DAYS, NOT YEARS, BUT 
MONTHS.\" 
 
9. (C) BLIX TOUCHED ON CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING PROGRESS IN 
VARIOUS AREAS.  MISSILES COULD BE VERIFIED AS THEY WERE 
DESTROYED - HE NOTED THAT 70 OF THE AL-SAMOUD MISSILES HAD 
BEEN DESTROYED SO FAR - AND THE REQUESTED DOCUMENTATION ON 
UAVS SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO DELIVER.  HOWEVER, IN THOSE 
CASES WHERE THERE WAS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE IRAQIS 
ACTUALLY HAD A SYSTEM - E.G., ANTHRAX OR MOBILE CW OR BW LABS 
- THE SITUATION WOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED.  IF THE IRAQIS 
ACTUALLY HAD THE SYSTEM, THEN IT SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD TASK TO TURN THE ITEMS OVER. HOWEVER, IF THEY 
DID NOT HAVE THE SYSTEMS, THEY WOULD FACE A FAR MORE 
CHALLENGING TASK IN ASSEMBLING THE DOCUMENTATION PROVING THAT 
THEY DID NOT HAVE, OR NEVER HAD, A PARTICULAR SYSTEM.   BLIX 
SAID THE IRAQIS HAD BEEN \"PRO-ACTIVE\" IN PROVIDING DOCUMENTS 
RECENTLY ON VX AND ANTHRAX, BUT THAT HE AWAITED UNMOVIC\'S 
ANALYSIS BEFORE PRONOUNCING ON THE PAPERS THEMSELVES. 
 
10. (C) BLIX NOTED THE CALLS FROM AMERICAN OFFICIALS URGING 
UNMOVIC WITHDRAWAL, AND SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE SYG\'S 
JUDGMENT. 
 
 
SYG: UN OPERATIONS SUSPENDED; PERSONNEL OUT 
------------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) SYG ANNAN ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING DECISIONS: 
 
-- ALL UN HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL WOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM 
IRAQ.  (NOTE: WHILE THE SYG DID NOT PROVIDE A TIMELINE, A 
PARTICIPANT IN THE MEETING WHERE THE SYG MADE THE DECISION 
SAID THE UN WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF 24 TO 48 HOURS.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
-- WITHDRAWAL OF UN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ WOULD INCLUDE 
CONTRACTORS FROM COTECNA AND SAYBOLT (NOTE:  AUTHENTICATORS 
OF OFF DELIVERIES AND OVERSEERS OF OIL LOADINGS, 
RESPECTIVELY. END NOTE.). IN ALL, THE NUMBER OF HUMANITARIAN 
WORKERS WITHDRAWING WOULD TOTAL 195. 
 
-- ANNAN SAID THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN STAFF WOULD LEAD TO THE 
SUSPENSION OF OIL-FOR-FOOD, WHICH COULD NO LONGER OPERATE 
WITHOUT PERSONNEL TO VERIFY OIL LIFTINGS OR OFF DELIVERIES 
AND DISTRIBUTION. 
 
-- THE SYG STRESSED THAT UN ACTION ON OFF WAS A SUSPENSION, 
NOT A CANCELLATION, AS THE LATTER WOULD REQUIRE A UNSC 
DECISION. 
 
-- WEAPONS INSPECTIONS WOULD ALSO BE SUSPENDED, WITH 130 
UNMOVIC AND 5 IAEA INSPECTORS BEING WITHDRAWN. 
 
-- UNIKOM MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WOULD ALSO BE 
INSTRUCTED TO WITHDRAW (MORE DETAILS SEPTEL). 
 
-- THE SYG SAID A LETTER WOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT, LISTING THESE STEPS AND EXPRESSING THE 
NEED TO CONTINUE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. 
 
 
RUSSIA:  MOVE FORWARD PROGRAM OF WORK, 
BUT NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE OFFERED 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) RUSSIAN PERMREP LAVROV EXPLAINED THE PROPOSAL 
CONTAINED IN THE MARCH 15 JOINT RUSSIAN - GERMAN - FRENCH 
DECLARATION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE DOCUMENT COULD \"SPEAK FOR 
ITSELF\" SINCE INSPECTIONS WERE UNDERWAY AND YIELDING RESULTS. 
IN CONTRAST TO THE AZORES STATEMENTS, RUSSIA \"TAKES A 
DIFFERENT APPROACH BASED ON CONCRETE FACTS, THAT INSPECTIONS 
ARE WORKING;\"  IRAQ HAD TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS ON THE SUBSTANCE 
OF THE REMAINING DISARMAMENT PROBLEMS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, 
LAVROV LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE DRAFT WORK PROGRAM 
LATER TODAY PER BLIX\'S EARLIER PROMISE TO HAVE IT COMPLETED. 
FRANCE, RUSSIA, AND GERMANY ALL BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
HOLD A MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE WORK 
PROGRAM, AND HE REQUESTED THAT THE COUNCIL SET A DATE SOON SO 
THAT THE MINISTERIAL COULD TAKE PLACE, PREFERABLY EITHER 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, SINCE IT WAS \"CLEAR 
WE CAN\'T DELAY.\" 
 
 
FRANCE: MORE OF THE SAME, BUT YOU CAN\'T BLAME FRANCE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
13. (C) PERMREP DE LA SABLIERE SAID THAT HE HAD A \"STRANGE 
FEELING THIS MORNING, WHICH PERHAPS OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS 
SHARED.\"  HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD BE DISCUSSING 
THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, \"TO WHICH ALL ARE 
DEDICATED,\" BUT \"MUCH TO MY SURPRISE,\" HE HAD LEARNED 
PUBLICLY THAT THE DRAFT RESOLUTION HAD BEEN \"WITHDRAWN.\"  OF 
COURSE, THE CO-SPONSORS COULD DO AS THEY SEE FIT, BUT THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED THAT THE RESOLUTION HAD BEEN 
\"WITHDRAWN\" OUTSIDE A COUNCIL SETTING.  UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEREBY THE INSPECTIONS WERE MAKING PROGRESS 
TOWARDS ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT IN A \"LIMITED 
TIMEFRAME,\" FRANCE COULD NOT SUPPORT A PROPOSAL THAT 
AUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE.  WHILE THE CO-SPONSORS HAD \"PUT 
FORTH\" THAT A PARTICULAR DELEGATION -- \"I BELIEVE MINE\" -- 
HAD MADE CLEAR IT WOULD OPPOSE A DRAFT AUTHORIZING THE USE OF 
FORCE, THE DRAFT RESOLUTION WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED A 
MAJORITY VOTE;  WITHOUT A MAJORITY, A \"NO\" VOTE DID NOT 
CONSTITUTE A \"VETO\" UNDER THE CHARTER, HE STATED.  THE 
DISCUSSIONS HELD DURING THE LAST WEEK HAD MADE CLEAR THAT THE 
MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS COULD NOT SUPPORT A RESOLUTION 
AUTHORIZING THE USE OF FORCE, FOR THEY REMAINED COMMITTED TO 
PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT. 
 
14. (C) LA SABLIERE SAID THAT THE COUNCIL WAS COLLECTIVELY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS \"BINDING\" RESOLUTIONS WHICH COULD LEAD TO 
THE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ.  THE INSPECTORS WERE 
TELLING THE COUNCIL THAT DISARMAMENT COULD BE ACHIEVED 
PEACEFULLY, HE STRESSED.  HE WAS THUS INTERESTED IN THE DRAFT 
WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS, WHICH HE BELIEVED SHOULD BE APPROVED 
ON MARCH 19 AT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL AS 
A FINAL COUNCIL DISCUSSION.  THERE WAS CONVICTION IN THE 
COUNCIL THAT BENCHMARKS, KRDTS, AND AN INSPECTOR-PROPOSED 
TIMEFRAME OF ONE OR TWO MONTHS COULD PROVIDE A BASIS FOR 
EVALUATION OF THE SITUATION, WITHOUT THE AUTOMATICITY 
\"CONTEMPLATED BY SOME, BUT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT FOR THE 
MAJORITY OF DELEGATIONS.\"  THE USE OF FORCE WITHOUT COUNCIL 
APPROVAL WAS NOT JUSTIFIED, GIVEN PROGRESS MADE IN 
INSPECTIONS, HE REPEATED.  THE COUNCIL COULD CONTINUE TO WORK 
ON THE BASIS \"DESIRED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE UN AND THE 
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.\"  IN A SEPARATE INTERVENTION, LA 
SABLIERE POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE COUNCIL TO 
DECIDE THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN STAFF.  HE PLACED FULL TRUST IN 
THE SYG TO MAKE THE DECISION ON \"TEMPORARY\" WITHDRAWAL, BUT 
NOTED THAT FRANCE WAS IN FAVOR CONTINUING INSPECTIONS. 
 
 
CHINA: STILL NEED MAXIMUM EFFORT 
-------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) CHINESE PERMREP WANG STATED CHINA BELIEVED THAT AS 
LONG AS THERE WAS ONE PERCENT HOPE, THE COUNCIL SHOULD MAKE 
THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE INSPECTIONS.  WANG SUPPORTED THE 
FRENCH, RUSSIAN, AND GERMAN MARCH 15 JOINT STATEMENT AND 
EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE MARCH 19 MINISTERIAL-LEVEL MEETING 
TO DISCUSS THE INSPECTORS\' WORK PROGRAM.  HE NOTED THE 
\"WITHDRAWAL\" OF THE CO-SPONSORS DRAFT RESOLUTION, AND 
EMPHASIZED THAT THIS WAS GOOD IF THE DECISION INDICATED THAT 
THERE WAS HOPE FOR CONSENSUS ON A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.  IF 
THIS DECISION SIGNIFIED A PATH TO WAR, THEN IT WAS \"VERY 
REGRETTABLE\" BECAUSE CHINA BELIEVED THAT THE REALIZATION OF 
PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE.  IT WAS IN THE 
INTEREST OF ALL SIDES TO CONTINUE INSPECTIONS AND AVOID WAR. 
ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ, CHINA WAS ALSO 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PERSONNEL, AND RESPECTED THE 
SYG\'S DECISION IN THAT REGARD. 
 
 
GERMANY: ON TO 1284, CONSENSUS NOT EQUAL TO UNANIMITY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
16. (C) GERMAN PERMREP PLEUGER AGREED WITH RUSSIAN PERMREP 
LAVROV\'S STATEMENTS REGARDING THE MARCH 15 JOINT DECLARATION. 
HE STRESSED THAT GERMANY STILL BELIEVED THAT THE COUNCIL 
COULD ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, AND THAT THE 
\"VAST MAJORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WANTED ANOTHER TRY 
AT ACHIEVING PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.\"  CONSENSUS DOES NOT MEAN 
UNANIMITY, HE STATED.  PLEUGER EMPHASIZED THAT HE \"COULD NOT 
ACCEPT THAT THE COUNCIL CONSENSUS WAS NOT IN LINE WITH UNSCR 
1441\" AS POSITED BY THE CO-SPONSORS.  ALL THOSE THAT WERE 
OPPOSED TO THE DRAFT RESOLUTION \"WERE NOT OUTSIDE 1441.\"  ON 
THE CONTRARY, THESE MEMBERS WANTED PEACE BASED ON UNSCRS 1441 
AND 1284.  AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO SUSPEND 
INSPECTIONS, HE STRESSED.   BLIX HAD PREPARED THE DRAFT WORK 
PROGRAM AND THE KRDTS.  MINISTERS COULD ACHIEVE CONSENSUS BY 
MEETING TO APPROVE THESE PROPOSALS, WHICH WERE \"NOT THAT 
DIFFERENT\" FROM THE UK BENCHMARKS.  THE SYG WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE SECURITY OF UN STAFF; THEREFORE, GERMANY WOULD 
SUPPORT ANY DECISION HE MADE ON UN WITHDRAWAL. 
 
 
SPAIN:  1441 IN ENTIRETY, CAN\'T BE SELECTIVE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
16. (C) SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS CONCURRED WITH AMBASSADOR 
GREENSTOCK THAT THE CO-SPONSORS WOULD NOT PROCEED WITH THE 
VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION.  BASED ON UNSCR 1441, READ AS A 
WHOLE, SPAIN HAD NOTED THAT IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH. 
SOME MEMBERS HAD NOT READ UNSCR 1441 AS A WHOLE, BUT HAD A 
TENDENCY TO OMIT CERTAIN POINTS, FOR EXAMPLE, \"ANY OMISSION 
OR FALSEHOOD\" OR \"NOT FULL COOPERATION\" WOULD RESULT IN A 
MATERIAL BREACH.  COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE PURSUING A DIFFICULT 
PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE WITHOUT MILITARY PRESSURE, THE INSPECTORS 
WOULD NOT BE IN IRAQ.  MERE LANGUAGE WOULD NOT FUNCTION 
WITHOUT AN ULTIMATUM.  LA SABLIERE SUGGESTED THAT THE 
CO-SPONSORS DID NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY OF VOTES.  BUT WHETHER 
OR NOT THIS WAS THE CASE, THE FRENCH DELEGATION SAID IT WOULD 
VETO, AND THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE. 
 
 
BULGARIA: SAD DAY FOR THE COUNCIL 
---------------------------------- 
 
17. (C) BULGARIAN PERMREP TAFROV STATED THAT IT WAS A \"SAD 
DAY FOR THE UN AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SAD THAT IT WAS 
CLEARER THAN EVER THAT SECURITY COUNCIL DIVISIONS OVER THE 
IRAQ CRISIS WERE INSURMOUNTABLE.\" BULGARIA HAD ADVOCATED 
COUNCIL UNITY AND WAS CONCERNED OVER THE TREND IN THE COUNCIL 
TOWARD TWO RIGID POSITIONS ON IRAQ.  THIS SPLIT SHOULD NOT 
HAVE DIVIDED THE COUNCIL ON ITS COMMON GOAL OF DISARMAMENT. 
BULGARIA SUPPORTED THE UK PROPOSAL, BELIEVING THAT IT 
PROVIDED THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF COMPROMISE FOR COUNCIL 
UNITY.  CERTAIN DELEGATIONS REJECTED THE PROPOSAL.  THE 
DIVISIONS IN THE COUNCIL LIKELY WOULD REMAIN FOR DAYS AND 
EVEN WEEKS, BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS SHOULD NOT RESORT TO \"MUTUAL 
RECRIMINATION.\"  DIFFERENCES IN THE COUNCIL WERE NOT 
\"INSURMOUNTABLE,\" AS LONG AS COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD THE 
POLITICAL DETERMINATION TO TAKE \"ONE LAST STEP.\"  IN THE 
FINAL ANALYSIS, BULGARIA WAS OPEN TO ANY PROPOSAL THAT COULD 
RESTORE COUNCIL UNITY. 
 
18. (C) FOR THE MOMENT, THE COUNCIL SHOULD FOCUS ON THE MAIN 
ISSUE OF THE FUTURE OF THE UN AS AN \"ESSENTIAL INSTITUTION 
FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE VERY INCARNATION OF THE 
PRINCIPLE OF MULTILATERALISM IN WORLD AFFAIRS.\"  IT WAS 
CRITICAL FOR THE COUNCIL TO RESTORE ITS CENTRAL ROLE ON THE 
ISSUE OF IRAQ, AND CONTINUE DIALOGUE.  THE COUNCIL, HOWEVER, 
NEEDED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND 
WITH REGARD TO THE SAFETY OF UN PERSONNEL.  BULGARIA WOULD 
HEED ADVICE ON UN WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SYG AND THE CHIEF 
INSPECTOR. 
 
 
PAKISTAN: THE ART OF SAYING LITTLE 
---------------------------------- 
 
19. (C)  IN WHAT HAS BECOME TYPICAL OF HIS INTERVENTIONS IN 
THE COUNCIL ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAQ, PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM 
CAUTIOUSLY AVOIDED MAKING CHOOSING SIDES IN THE DEBATE, 
SAYING IT WAS CLEAR THE COUNCIL WAS AT AN IMPASSE.  PAKISTAN 
HAD SOUGHT \"FULL AND FAITHFUL\" IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCRS AS 
THE SOLUTION TO IRAQ\'S WMD, AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. 
DISARMAMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS HAD ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG 
PREFERENCE.  PAKISTAN HAVE ALSO BELIEVED IN THE UNITY OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL IN ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY THE COUNCIL HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND 
CONVERGENCE IN ANY OF THE PROPOSALS WHICH HAD BEEN TABLED BY 
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.  THAT SAID, PAKISTAN BELIEVED THAT 
TIME AND SPACE FOR DIPLOMACY DID NOT END, AND DIPLOMATIC 
OPTIONS MUST CONTINUE TO BE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO FIND A 
UNITED STAND.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD RECEIVE THE PROGRAM OF WORK 
WHILE CONTINUING TO URGE A RESPONSE FROM THE IRAQI 
AUTHORITIES EVEN AT THIS LATE DATE. 
 
 
CHILE, MEXICO: (TYPICALLY OF LATE) UNHELPFUL 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
20. (C) CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES AGREED THAT IT WAS A SAD DAY 
FOR THE UNITED NATIONS, \"GIVEN THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE 
STRENGTHENED AND MORE EFFECTIVE DAILY... THEY COULD HAVE 
ACHIEVED THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, AND CHANGED THE DYNAMIC 
THERE,\" WHICH HE ASSERTED WOULD HAVE LED TO GREATER DEMOCRACY 
IN IRAQ.  CHILE REGRETTED THAT ITS PROPOSAL TO BRIDGE 
DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE P-5 HAD BEEN REJECTED BEFORE IT WAS 
FULLY CIRCULATED FOR CONSIDERATION.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE 
NEED TO \"MAINTAIN A CONSTRUCTIVE CLIMATE\" IN THE COUNCIL, HE 
WARNED MEMBERS AGAINST RECRIMINATIONS.  CHILE SUPPORTED THE 
PRESENTATION OF THE PROGRAM OF WORK, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS \"NO 
REASON\" TO IGNORE THE SERIOUS SITUATION ON THE SECURITY OF 
IRAQ AND THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW UN PERSONNEL. 
 
21. (C) MEXICAN PERMREP AGUILAR-ZINSER MADE A 
CHARACTERISTICALLY LONG INTERVENTION, ECHOING PREVIOUS POINTS 
MADE IN THE COUNCIL, OUTLINING MEXICO\'S INTERPRETATION OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN CHARTER.  HE REGRETTED THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN NO UNANIMOUS DECISION WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED 
THE COUNCIL TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, AND, 
RECALLING 1441, REGRETTED THAT THE CONCLUSION HAD NOT BEEN TO 
SEEK A UNANIMOUS DECISION ON PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.  MEXICO 
HAD CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORTH BY THE U.S., 
UK AND SPAIN AS CO-SPONSORS OF THE DRAFT RESOLUTION. 
FURTHER, MEXICO SHARED BILATERAL COMMITMENTS THAT RELATED TO 
COMMON SECURITY \"WITH ONE CO-SPONSOR WITH WHOM WE SHARE 
GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY AND POLICY GOALS;\"  MEXICO WOULD 
DEFEND THE IMMEDIATE SPHERE OF SECURITY TOGETHER WITH THAT 
PARTNER. 
 
22. (C) WITH RESPECT TO THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, HOWEVER, 
MEXICO BASED ITS POSITION ON THE CONVICTION THAT ACTION 
SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK WITH FULL 
AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE.   WHILE MEXICO HAD NEITHER 
\"ARSENALS NOR STRATEGIC PROJECTS NOR FINANCIAL INTERESTS 
GLOBALLY,\" ITS EXTERNAL POLICIES WERE FOUNDED ON THEIR 
CONSTITUTION WHICH REGULATED ITS BEHAVIOR.  PRESIDENT FOX HAD 
SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED HIS FOREIGN MINISTER AND PERMREP TO 
ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MEXICAN 
CONSTITUTION:  ONE REQUIRED PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WITH FORCE 
ONLY BROUGHT AT THE FINAL MOMENT, AND ANOTHER REQUIRED THAT 
THE THREAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS SUCH BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
\"AS THE SOLE BODY AUTHORIZED TO DECLARE THE USE OF SUCH 
FORCE.\"  HOPE WAS NOT YET EXHAUSTED, AND THUS \"THERE WAS NO 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF FORCE IN DISARMING IRAQ.\"  THE 
PRECEPTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN CHARTER SET FORTH 
THE CONDITIONS FOR USE OF FORCE; MEXICO DID NOT SEE THAT 
THOSE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN MET. THE SECURITY COUNCIL CANNOT 
RELINQUISH AUTHORITY HERE, FOR MAJORITIES -- WHETHER OR NOT 
UNANIMOUS -- ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF COLLECTIVE WILL. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN MUST DISARM, MUST ABIDE BY THE RELEVANT 
UNSCRS, AND CANNOT THREATEN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. 
 IN THAT CONTEXT, MEXICO SUPPORTED THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK, 
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A STANDARD TO DISARMAMENT EFFORTS, HE 
CONCLUDED. 
 
 
ANGOLA, CAMEROON, GUINEA: REGRETFUL, 
BUT STILL TINGED WITH HOPE 
--------------------------- 
 
23. (C) ANGOLAN PERMREP GASPAR-MARTINS SAID THAT THE BLIX AND 
EL-BARADEI REPORTS TO THE COUNCIL HAD MADE CLEAR THAT 
INSPECTIONS WERE PRODUCING SOME RESULTS IN THE ATTEMPT TO 
DISARM IRAQ, BUT THOSE RESULTS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO EVERY 
MEMBER.  ALTHOUGH ALL PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS HAD TO BE EXHAUSTED 
BEFORE MOVING TO WAR, THAT SEEMED TO BE THE SITUATION FACING 
THE COUNCIL.  IN THAT CONTEXT, HE PAID TRIBUTE TO THE MOST 
RECENT UK EFFORT, BUT \"EVEN THAT\" DID NOT WORK.  WAR CAUSED 
UNTOLD SUFFERING, AND IF THE COUNCIL COULD AVOID A DECISION 
HAVING TO UPHOLD WAR, IT SHOULD DO SO.  ON A PRACTICAL NOTE, 
GASPAR-MARTINS SUGGESTED THAT SOME TIME SHOULD ELAPSE BEFORE 
HOLDING ANOTHER MINISTERIAL MEETING, \"TO LET THINGS CALM 
DOWN.\"  IF GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE CONVINCED OF MOVING FORWARD 
ON THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK WITH THE FULL COMMITMENT OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL, HOWEVER, THEN THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO 
DO SO. 
 
24. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU AGREED THAT THE 
COUNCIL WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LIMITS OF DIPLOMACY IN 
MANAGING THE IRAQI CRISIS.  DESPITE THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF 
THE PREVIOUS 48 HOURS IN THE CAR, THE COUNCIL HAD NOT 
REGISTERED THAT CRISIS; THIS SIMPLE FACT SUPPORTED HIS 
ASSERTION.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE COUNCIL\'S DISUNITY WAS A 
\"DISSERVICE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND MULTILATERALISM,\" AND 
APPEALED FOR THE P-5 TO CAUCUS AND SORT OUT THEIR 
DIFFERENCES.  THE SIX HAD PROPOSED ELEMENTS FOR A 
PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT THAT HAD BEEN REJECTED, BUT WHICH 
REMAINED ON THE TABLE.  HE CONCLUDED THAT \"A MIRACLE\" COULD 
NOT YET BE RULED OUT. 
 
25. (C) GUINEAN PERMREP TRAORE, COUNCIL PRESIDENT FOR MARCH, 
SAID THAT GUINEA HAD SPARED NO EFFORT TO FIND A COMPROMISE 
THAT WOULD BE HEAL THE DEADLOCK IN THE COUNCIL.  HOWEVER, THE 
FRENCH - GERMAN - RUSSIAN DECLARATION OF MARCH 15 AND THE 
AZORES SUMMIT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COUNCIL WAS \"MORE DIVIDED 
THAN EVER.\"  ALL WILL LOSE WITHOUT SOME COMPROMISE, HE 
WARNED; HE HOPED SOME COMPROMISE SOLUTION COULD STILL BE 
FOUND. 
 
 
SYRIA: DEADLOCK 
--------------- 
 
26. (C) SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE SAID THAT THE COUNCIL HAD \"TRULY 
REACHED A STATE OF COMPLETE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION IN 
IRAQ,\" WITH THE U.S. INFORMING UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA TO 
EVACUATE, THE INSPECTORS\' WITHDRAWAL, AND THE STATEMENTS MADE 
IN THE AZORES.  THE COUNCIL HAD REACHED DEADLOCK, BUT THERE 
WAS STILL ANOTHER COURSE: THE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. 
THE COUNCIL AGREED UNDER UNSCR 1441 THAT THE AIMS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD BE TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL 
DISARMAMENT.  UNSCRS 1284 AND 1441 ESTABLISHED UNMOVIC AND 
REINFORCED THE INSPECTIONS SYSTEM.  IRAQ WAS COOPERATING ON 
PROCEDURE AND SUBSTANCE; IT MADE POSITIVE EFFORTS TO DESTROY 
WEAPONS, AND HAD PRODUCED REPORTS ON ANTHRAX AND VX.  NOW THE 
COUNCIL HAD \"GREATER DETERMINATION AND JUSTIFICATION FOR WORK 
UNDER 1441\" AND CONTINUED COUNCIL UNITY BECAUSE THE 
INSPECTORS WERE READY TO PRESENT A WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS. 
WEHBE SUPPORTED LAVROV\'S PROPOSAL TO HEAR THE WORK PROGRAM ON 
MARCH 19 TO \"LEAD TOWARDS ADDITIONAL PEACEFUL ACTION.\"

HIS EXCELLENCY 
MR. NAJI SABRI 
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ 
BAGHDAD 
 
17 MARCH 2003 
 
EXCELLENCY, 
 
ON SUNDAY 16 MARCH 2003, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED 
KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES CONVEYED TO ME WARNINGS 
REGARDING THE CONTINUED SAFETY AND SECURITY OF UN PERSONNEL 
PRESENT IN THE TERRITORY OF IRAQ.  SIMILAR WARNINGS WERE 
TRANSMITTED TO DR. EL-BARADEI OF (THE) IAEA AND DR. HANS 
BLIX, THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC. 
 
AFTER CONSULTING WITH DR. EL-BARADEI, DR. BLIX AND SENIOR UN 
OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF UN PERSONNEL IN 
IRAQ, I DECIDED THIS MORNING THAT, SINCE I WAS NO LONGER IN A 
POSITION TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THESE 
PERSONNEL, I WAS OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW TEMPORARILY ALL 
REMAINING HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL NUMBERING SOME 195 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF INCLUDING THE PERSONNEL OF COTECNA AND 
SAYBOLT, THE REMAINING 135 UNMOVIC STAFF (WHICH INCLUDES WITH 
THE CONCURRENCE OF DR. EL-BARADEI 5 IAEA STAFF), AS WELL AS 
ALL UNIKOM MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ. 
 
I AM WELL AWARE THAT THESE MEASURES WILL LEAD TO THE 
SUSPENSION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMMES 
IN IRAQ PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 986 (1995), AS WELL AS THE 
WORK OF BOTH UNMOVIC AND UNIKOM.  HOWEVER, THE THREAT TO THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE PERSONNEL CONCERNED HAS IN EFFECT 
RENDERED THEIR MANDATES INOPERABLE. 
 
FOR THE RECORD, I WISH TO STATE THAT I REGARD THOSE 
ACTIVITIES AS SUSPENDED DE FACTO.  THE MANDATES ESTABLISHED 
BY THE RELEVANT SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS UNDER WHICH 
THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL SUCH 
TIME AS THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD DECIDE OTHERWISE. 
 
I INFORMED THE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF MY DECISION 
IN THE INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING 
AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TOOK NOTE OF MY DECISION. 
 
ALTHOUGH THIS DECISION WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE REASONS 
INDICATED, I SHOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT THE 
UNITED NATIONS CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED TO ASSISTING THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAQ WHO HAVE SUFFERED SUCH HARDSHIP AND HAVE 
DEPENDED FOR SUPPORT ON THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAMME.  THE 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES CAN BE RESUMED AS SOON AS THE SITUATION 
PERMITS THE RETURN OF UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL TO IRAQ WITH 
THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH IS RECEPTIVE TO 
THIS APPROACH. 
 
PLEASE ACCEPT, EXCELLENCY, THE ASSURANCES OF MY HIGHEST 
CONSIDERATION.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PARM, UNSC, IZ 
SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: SYG MAKES STATEMENT TO COUNCIL ON IRAQ, 
MARCH 19 (FULL TEXT) 
 
1. (U) IN REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL MARCH 19, SYG ANNAN 
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT REACH A COMMON 
POSITION ON IRAQ, CALLING IT A \"SAD DAY\" FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ANNAN STATED THAT \"THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON 
THE BELLIGERENTS; IN ANY AREA UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION, 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE 
OCCUPYING POWER.\"  THE UN WOULD PROVIDE WHATEVER ASSISTANCE 
IT COULD TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE \"WITHOUT IN ANY WAY ASSUMING OR 
DIMINISHING THAT ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.\"  THE FULL TEXT OF 
THE ANNAN\'S SPEECH IN INCLUDED AT PARA 2. 
 
2. (U) BEGIN TEXT. 
 
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
 
EXCELLENCIES, 
 
NEEDLESS TO SAY, I FULLY SHARE THE REGRETS EXPRESSED BY MANY 
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AT THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN 
POSSIBLE TO REACH A COMMON POSITION.  WHATEVER OUR DIFFERING 
VIEWS ON THIS COMPLEX ISSUE, WE MUST ALL FEEL THAT THIS IS A 
SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY. 
 
I KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARE THIS 
SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT, AND ARE DEEPLY ALARMED BY THE 
PROSPECT OF IMMINENT WAR. 
 
LET ME HERE PAY TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED NATIONS STAFF BOTH 
INTERNATIONAL AND IRAQI WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD IN IRAQ UP TO 
THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT.  THAT INCLUDES THE INSPECTORS, 
WHOSE WORK HAS NOW SADLY BEEN SUSPENDED.  I WOULD LIKE TO PAY 
SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO DR. (HANS) BLIX, DR. (MOHAMED) EL BARADEI 
AND (RAMIRO) LOPES DA SILVA, THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR, 
UNDER WHOSE LEADERSHIP THE STAFF WORKED IN IRAQ. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS THE PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE WHICH IS 
NOW MY MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN, AND I HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HEAR 
THAT SENTIMENT SHARED BY ALL THE SPEAKERS IN THIS DEBATE. 
 
IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS, IRAQIS HAVE BEEN THROUGH TWO MAJOR 
WARS, INTERNAL UPRISINGS AND CONFLICT, AND MORE THAN A DECADE 
OF DEBILITATING SANCTIONS. 
 
THE COUNTRY\'S VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN DEVASTATED, SO 
THAT IT NO LONGER MEETS THE MOST BASIC NEEDS FOR CLEAN WATER, 
HEALTH OR EDUCATION. 
 
ALREADY, IRAQ\'S MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS THE ELDERLY, WOMEN 
AND CHILDREN, AND THE DISABLED ARE DENIED BASIC HEALTH CARE 
FOR LACK OF MEDICINE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. 
 
ALREADY, NEARLY ONE MILLION IRAQI CHILDREN SUFFER FROM 
CHRONIC MALNUTRITION. 
 
ALREADY, IRAQIS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FOOD RATION 
WHICH IS HANDED OUT EACH MONTH TO EVERY FAMILY IN THE 
COUNTRY.  FOR MORE THAN SIXTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION, 
THIS RATION IS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME. YET MANY FAMILIES 
HAVE TO SELL PART OF IT TO BUY CLOTHES OR OTHER ESSENTIALS 
FOR THEIR CHILDREN. 
 
ALL THAT IS TRUE AS WE SPEAK.  AND IN THE SHORT TERM, THE 
CONFLICT THAT IS NOW CLEARLY ABOUT TO START CAN ONLY MAKE 
THINGS WORSE, PERHAPS MUCH WORSE. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, 
 
I AM SURE ALL MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL WILL AGREE THAT WE MUST 
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MITIGATE THIS IMMINENT DISASTER, 
WHICH COULD EASILY LEAD TO EPIDEMICS AND STARVATION. 
 
UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING 
CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON THE BELLIGERENTS; IN ANY AREA 
UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION, RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF 
THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE OCCUPYING POWER. 
 
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY ASSUMING OR DIMINISHING THAT ULTIMATE 
RESPONSIBILITY, WE IN THE UNITED NATIONS WILL DO WHATEVER WE 
CAN TO HELP. 
 
AS YOU KNOW, THE HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
HAVE FOR SOME TIME BEEN ENGAGED IN PREPARING FOR THIS 
CONTINGENCY, EVEN WHILE WE HOPED IT COULD STILL BE AVERTED. 
 
WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO ASSESS THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF WAR, 
IN TERMS OF POPULATION DISPLACEMENT AND HUMAN NEED, AND TO 
POSITION OUR PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT ACCORDINGLY.  FOR THESE 
PREPARATIONS WE REQUESTED 123.5 MILLION DOLLARS FROM DONORS A 
MONTH AGO, BUT ONLY 45 MILLION HAVE BEEN PLEDGED, AND 34 
MILLION DOLLARS RECEIVED, TO DATE.  I\'M AFRAID WE SHALL VERY 
SOON BE COMING BACK WITH AN APPEAL FOR MUCH LARGER SUMS, TO 
FINANCE ACTUAL RELIEF OPERATIONS AND I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT 
MEMBER STATES WILL RESPOND WITH GENEROSITY AND SPEED. 
 
WE HAVE ALSO EXAMINED THE SITUATION CAUSED BY THE SUSPENSION 
OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAMME IN IRAQ, AND 
WAYS THAT THE PROGRAMME COULD BE ADJUSTED TEMPORARILY, TO 
ENABLE US TO CONTINUE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO 
THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ DURING AND AFTER HOSTILITIES. 
 
SUCH ADJUSTMENTS WOULD REQUIRE DECISIONS BY THIS COUNCIL.  I 
WILL THEREFORE SUBMIT MY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR THE COUNCIL\'S 
CONSIDERATION - AS SUGGESTED IN YOUR NOTE, MR. PRESIDENT. 
 
IN CONCLUSION, MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT 
THE EFFORT TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND 
TO REHABILITATE THEIR SOCIETY AFTER SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, MAY 
YET PROVE TO BE THE TASK AROUND WHICH THE UNITY OF THIS 
COUNCIL CAN BE REBUILT. 
 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; 
REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN A FRANKLY ANTI-CLIMATIC CONCLUSION TO THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL\'S ROLE IN DEBATING THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, 
THE COUNCIL HELD AN OPEN SESSION MARCH 19 ATTENDED BY 
MINISTERS FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, SYRIA, AND GUINEA. 
(GUINEAN FM FALL WAS IN NEW YORK TO PRESIDE OVER THE COUNCIL 
SESSION ON SMALL ARMS AND MERCENARIES IN AFRICA WEDNESDAY, 
AND REMAINED FOR THE MEETING.)  WHILE DIVISIVENESS AMONG 
COUNCIL MEMBERS WAS MUTED, MARKING MOVEMENT TO MINIMIZE 
DIFFERENCES, NATIONAL STATEMENTS NONETHELESS REFLECTED 
CLASSICAL POSTURES ON IRAQ, LIKELY TO RESURFACE IN UPCOMING 
COUNCIL DIALOGUES ABOUT OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) AND OTHER NEXT 
STEPS.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESS SPOTLIGHT ON THE COUNCIL HAD 
LARGELY DIMMED EVEN BEFORE THE MEETING, MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS 
-- EXCLUSIVE OF THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN -- DEFENSIVELY 
POSTURED ABOUT THE RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BOTH THE 
COUNCIL AND, MORE BROADLY, THE UNITED NATIONS. 
 
2. (C) BLIX ACKNOWLEDGED THE LIMITED RELEVANCE OF THE DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK BEFORE THE COUNCIL, WHILE SYG ANNAN MET HEAD 
ON THE FACT THAT HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGES WOULD ARISE FROM 
MILITARY CONFLICT.  BOTH AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND UK PERMREP 
GREENSTOCK SPOKE TO STEPS ALREADY TAKEN IN PREPARING FOR 
HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, WHILE SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS SET OUT 
SUCCINCTLY AND CLEARLY SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S PATH TOWARDS 
CONFRONTATION.  FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN SET OUT TWO ALTERNATE 
APPROACHES IN THE WORLD TODAY: THE USE OF FORCE TO SOLVE 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND, BY WAY OF CONTRAST, A LONG-TERM 
APPROACH WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS, INCLUDING 
RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL, NEEDED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. 
THAT SAID, FRANCE WOULD BE A \"FULL PARTICIPANT IN STANCHING 
THE WOUNDS OF WAR.\"  RUSSIAN FM IVANOV REJECTED ANY LINKAGE 
BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ, AS WELL AS ANY LEGITIMACY OTHER THAN 
THAT CONFERRED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE USE OF FORCE.  GERMAN 
FM FISCHER DEFENDED THE COUNCIL AND REITERATED GERMAN 
OPPOSITION TO ANY MILITARY SOLUTION, STRESSING THAT PROGRESS 
WAS BEING MADE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SYRIAN FM SHARA\'S 
RHETORICAL STATEMENT, OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS\' STATEMENTS WERE 
LARGELY UNREMARKABLE, GROUPED AROUND SEVERAL MAIN THEMES: 
THE COUNCIL\'S ROLE AND LEGITIMACY, PREFERENCE FOR A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION BUT RECOGNITION THAT SUCH HAD FAILED, AND IMPERATIVE 
TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION TO THE GREATEST 
EXTENT POSSIBLE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
U.S., UK, SPAIN, BULGARIA:  RESOLUTE, BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 
AVOIDED 
 
 
U.S.: FOCUS FORWARD ON HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THANKED UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA FOR 
THEIR WORK PROGRAMS AND THEIR EFFORTS, BUT POINTED OUT THAT 
IMMEDIATE APPROVAL OF THEIR WORK PROGRAMS WAS INCOMPATIBLE 
WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF IRAQI COOPERATION AND PREMATURE 
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND.  HE ASKED THAT THE 
WORK PROGRAM BE SET ASIDE FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT SAID THE 
UNITED STATES DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY 
PROVE USEFUL TO RETURN TO THESE DOCUMENTS AT SOME TIME IN THE 
FUTURE. 
 
4. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THEN TURNED THE COUNCIL\'S 
ATTENTION TO THE FUTURE, AND THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE IN THE TIME AHEAD.   HE TOUCHED ON U.S. PLANNING 
EFFORTS, ANNOUNCED THE DISPATCH OF A DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
RESPONSE TEAM (DART), THE PRE-POSITIONING OF USD 16.5 MILLION 
IN SUPPLIES, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF USD 60 MILLION TO UN 
AGENCIES. HE SAID THE U.S. WOULD INCREASE DONATIONS, AND 
URGED OTHER DONORS TO DO LIKEWISE.  AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. WOULD SOON PRESENT A DRAFT 
HUMANITARIAN RESOLUTION TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE 
OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM.  HE ENDED BY EXPRESSING U.S. READINESS 
TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE SITUATION 
IN IRAQ IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. 
 
5. (U) FULL TEXT OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE\'S REMARKS SENT REF A. 
 
 
UK: LOOKING AHEAD 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) UK PR GREENSTOCK SAID THE UK HAD TRIED HARD TO AVERT 
CONFLICT AND SEE TO IRAQ\'S PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, BUT THAT 
IRAQ FOR TWELVE YEARS HAD FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE COUNCIL\'S 
PLEAS OR DEMANDS.  HE OBSERVED THAT, IF IRAQ HAD RESPECTED 
THE UN, THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE FACING HOSTILITIES. 
 
7. (C) GREENSTOCK ARGUED THAT THE UN HAD TO PLAY A ROLE IN 
IRAQ\'S FUTURE, AND QUOTED UK FS STRAW\'S MARCH 17 COMMENTS 
REGARDING SAFEGUARDING IRAQ\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, THE 
LIFTING OF SANCTIONS, AND THE RIGHT OF IRAQ\'S PEOPLE TO 
IRAQ\'S OIL WEALTH.  GREENSTOCK EXPRESSED THE UK\'S SUPPORT FOR 
RECONFIGURING OFF AND SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE 
PRESENTATION OF IDEAS BY THE SYG.  HE ALSO ADVOCATED FUTURE 
ROLES FOR UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA IN ASSESSING IRAQI WMD PLANS 
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONGOING MONITORING SYSTEM. 
 
8. (C) GREENSTOCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE HMG MINISTER FOR 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS IN NEW YORK ON MARCH 19 AND 
THAT THE UK WOULD BE DONATING USD 110 MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO DONATE MORE. 
 
9. (C) TURNING TO THE UNMOVIC WORK PROGRAM AND KEY REMAINING 
DISARMAMENT TASKS, GREENSTOCK SAID THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD 
REQUIRE A COOPERATING IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  BOTH WORK PROGRAMS 
SHOULD BE KEPT UNDER REVIEW, READY TO BE USED WITH AN IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO COOPERATE ACTIVELY, IMMEDIATELY, AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY. 
 
 
SPAIN: SADDAM\'S PATH OF CONFRONTATION 
------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS, WHILE COMMENDING THE WORK OF 
THE INSPECTORS, SQUARELY BLAMED SADDAM HUSSEIN FOR THE 
SUSPENSION OF INSPECTIONS.  HE STATED: 
 
-- SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD OPENLY CHOSEN THE PATH OF 
CONFRONTATION, AND HE ALONE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
CONFRONTING THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES LAID OUT IN UNSC 
RESOLUTIONS. 
 
-- THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF USNCR 1441 CHANGED THE PARADIGM 
OF INSPECTIONS UNDER UNSCR 1284 AND THE PROGRAM OF WORK. 
WITHOUT FULL COOPERATION FROM IRAQ, THE WORK PROGRAM WOULD 
NOT BE POSSIBLE. 
 
-- TOGETHER WITH THE U.S. AND UK, SPAIN HAD TRIED TO ACHIEVE 
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI CRISIS THROUGH INCREASED 
PRESSURE FOR IRAQ TO MAKE A \"STRATEGIC DECISION\" TO COOPERATE 
FULLY WITH INSPECTORS.  IRAQ HAD FAILED TO TAKE ITS FINAL 
OPPORTUNITY. 
 
-- SPAIN BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT A NEW RESOLUTION WAS NOT 
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR FORCE WAS GIVEN IN 
UNSCRS 660, 678, 687 AND 1441. 
 
-- IRAQ HAD NOT MET ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSCR 687, 
INCLUDING CONTINUING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO TERRORISTS. 
 
-- AT THIS LATE STAGE, IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SUBMIT A FULL 
ACCOUNT OF ITS WMD DEMANDED BY PARAGRAPH NINE OF UNSCR 687, 
AND LATER EMPHASIZED IN UNSCR 1441. 
 
-- SPAIN REMAINED CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN DIMENSION 
OF CONFLICT.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD CONSIDER A DRAFT RESOLUTION 
TO ALLEVIATE HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
 
BULGARIA: IRAQI REFUSAL TO COOPERATE 
EXHAUSTED POLITICAL PROCESS 
------------------------------------ 
 
11. (C) BULGARIAN PERMREP TAFROV STATED THAT THE SUSPENSION 
OF INSPECTIONS SHOULD NOT CALL INTO QUESTION THE USEFULNESS 
OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS WRIT LARGE IN THE PREVENTION OF 
WMD PROLIFERATION.  HE CONTINUED: 
 
-- ACTIVE AND FULL COOPERATION WAS REQUIRED FOR INSPECTIONS 
TO BE EFFECTIVE.  IRAQ HAD NOT COOPERATED ACTIVELY. 
 
-- BULGARIA REGRETTED THAT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS DID NOT YIELD 
RESULTS.  IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH INSPECTIONS HAD 
CAUSED THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO BECOME EXHAUSTED, AND THE 
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1441 NOT TO BE REALIZED. 
 
-- IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SEIZE THE LAST CHANCE TO DISARM IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY UNSCR 1441. 
 
-- WHILE THE COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THE ISSUE 
OF IRAQI DISARMAMENT, IT WAS NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME 
UNITY ON THE METHOD OF DISARMAMENT. 
 
-- BULGARIA SUPPORTED THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW ALL UN 
STAFF FROM IRAQ TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. 
 
-- NOW THE COUNCIL SHOULD FOCUS ON THE URGENCY OF THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND SUPPORT THE CIVILIAN 
POPULATION OF IRAQ. 
 
-- BULGARIA WANTED TO PRESERVE THE ROLE OF THE UN AND THE 
COUNCIL WHICH PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN PRESERVING 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE WORLD.  ACCORDINGLY, 
THE COUNCIL SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE REBUILDING 
OF IRAQ AFTER CONFLICT. 
 
 
SYG ANNAN: SAD DAY FOR THE WORLD; 
OCCUPYING POWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQI PEOPLE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
12. (U) SYG ANNAN (FULL REMARKS IN REF B) SAID THE SESSION 
MARKED \"A SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.\"  HE CONTINUED THAT \"MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARED THIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT 
AND ARE DEEPLY ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF IMMINENT WAR.\"  THE 
SYG COMMENDED THE WORK OF UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA, AND SAID HIS 
PRIMARY CONCERN NOW WAS DEALING WITH THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  THE SYG WARNED THAT, UNDER 
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING 
CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON THE BELLIGERENTS. SIMILARLY, 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE 
OCCUPYING POWER.  ANNAN WARNED THAT HE HAD REQUESTED USD 
123.5 MILLION FROM DONORS, BUT TO DATE HAD RECEIVED ONLY USD 
45 MILLION IN PLEDGES AND OF THAT USD 34 MILLION HAS ACTUALLY 
BEEN RECEIVED.  ANNAN CONCLUDED THAT THE TASK OF REBUILDING 
AND REHABILITATING IRAQ COULD YET PROVE TO BE TASK AROUND 
WHICH THE UNITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD BE REBUILT. 
 
 
BLIX: WORK PROGRAM NOW HAS LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
13. (U) UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX (FULL COMMENTS REF C) 
EXPRESSED RELIEF THAT ALL UNMOVIC PERSONNEL HAD BEEN SAFELY 
EVACUATED TO CYPRUS.  HE TOUCHED ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COUNCIL MEMBERS ON MONDAY, MARCH 17, AND 
\"EXPRESSED SADNESS THAT THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OF WORK 
CARRIED OUT IN IRAQ HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE ASSURANCES NEEDED 
ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\"  BLIX 
RECOGNIZED THAT THE WORK PROGRAM HAD BEEN DRAFTED FOR 
IMPLEMENTATION BY A LARGE STAFF OF UNMOVIC INSPECTORS, AND 
THAT IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION.  HE ADVISED THAT UNMOVIC ROLES AND 
FUNCTIONS CONTINUE UNLESS AMENDED BY A FURTHER DECISION BY 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THAT THE UNMOVIC STAFF DID 
REPRESENT A UNIQUE BODY OF EXPERIENCE THAT SHOULD BE KEPT IN 
MIND BY MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. 
 
 
IAEA: READY FOR QUESTIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
14. (C) IAEA NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE ZLAUVINEN ANNOUNCED THAT 
THE IAEA WORK PROGRAM WAS READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS (FAXED TO NP AND IO/UNP AND REF D).  HE SAID THAT 
IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL EL-BARADEI WAS READY TO FIELD ANY 
INQUIRIES FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
 
 
FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA, GERMANY, SYRIA 
 
 
FRANCE:  \"DEMOCRACIES SHOULD SET THE EXAMPLE; 
PERSUASION AS IMPORTANT AS RAW POWER 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN FOCUSED HIS REMARKS ON THE NEED 
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FOCUS ON COOPERATIVE 
EFFORTS ACROSS A RANGE OF ISSUES.  VILLEPIN OFFERED A MORE 
MEASURED PRESENTATION, ALBEIT ONE STILL COUCHED IN SWEEPING 
TERMS, THAN HIS PAST PRESENTATIONS IN THE COUNCIL.  AS 
BEFORE, APPLAUSE ERUPTED IN THE CHAMBER AT THE CONCLUSION OF 
HIS INTERVENTION.  FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS REPORTED REF E. 
 
-- THE MAP LAID OUT IN UNSCR 1441 WAS STILL AVAILABLE 
ALTHOUGH BEING \"BLOCKED\" TODAY; 
 
-- TWO VISIONS WERE REFLECTED IN THE WORLD TODAY:  THE USE OF 
FORCE TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS VERSUS A LONG-TERM APPROACH 
WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS OF PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, SUCH AS RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL FACTORS. 
 
-- DEMOCRACIES NEED TO SET THE EXAMPLE. 
 
-- THE MIDDLE EAST WAS A REGION OF ANCIENT CONFLICTS AND 
INSTABILITY. 
 
-- IRAQ COULD HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR 
OTHER NON-PROLIFERATION AREAS; A TOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
FURTHER EXPLORED.  WHY NOT A UN \"DISARMAMENT CORPS\" UNDER AN 
INTERNATIONAL UMBRELLA? 
 
-- THE WORLD NOW RAN THE RISK OF FAILURE, INCREASING TENSION 
AND HELPING FEED TERRORISM. 
 
-- NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO SOON STAUNCH THE WOUNDS OF WAR 
AND FOCUS ON HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE; WE MUST PREVAIL OVER 
DIFFERENCES.  FRANCE INTENDED TO BE A FULL PARTICIPANT IN 
SUCH EFFORTS. 
 
-- THE OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM NEEDED TO CONTINUE WITH 
NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS - FRANCE LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING 
THE SYG,S PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD. 
 
-- NO ONE STATE COULD LAY CLAIM TO BUILDING THE PEACE; THE UN 
WAS THE ONLY AUTHORITY IN SUCH CASES. 
 
-- TWO PRINCIPLES NEEDED TO BE FOLLOWED:  TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY OF IRAQ AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY. 
 
-- THE WORLD FACED OTHER THREATS, SUCH AS TERRORISM AND 
ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORKS; STATES MUST SHOW UNITY IN SUCH 
AREAS AND ON ALL FRONTS. 
 
-- THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM NEEDED TO BE INTENSIFIED, 
WITH NEW IMPETUS ON DEALING WITH WMD; FRANCE SUGGESTED A 
MEETING OF HEADS OF STATE/GOVERNMENT ON THE SIDELINES OF THE 
NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
 
-- THERE WERE NEW INITIATIVES ON THE MIDDLE EAST THAT 
DESERVED ATTENTION. 
 
-- IN DEALING WITH THESE ASYMMETRICAL THREATS, THE ABILITY OF 
COUNTRIES TO \"PERSUADE WOULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE NUMBER OF 
(MILITARY) DIVISIONS.\" 
 
-- THREE FACTORS WERE INDISPUTABLE TO A COUNTRY\'S INFLUENCE: 
RESPECT FOR LAW, DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND A SHOW OF 
DIALOGUE AND TOLERANCE. 
 
 
RUSSIA:  WE REMEMBERED 9/11 AND WERE THERE 
FOR YOU -- BUT NO LINKAGE WITH IRAQ 
------------------------------------------- 
 
16. (C) RUSSIAN FM IVANOV RESTATED THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF 
THE COUNCIL IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT 
PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH 
AFTER 9/11 TRAGEDY.  STILL, THERE WAS NO PROOF THAT A LINK 
BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ EXISTED.  HE SAID: 
 
--  INSPECTORS WERE ACHIEVING TANGIBLE RESULTS; BAGHDAD HAD 
VIRTUALLY FULFILLED ALL CONDITIONS/TASKS WITH FEW OBSTACLES. 
 
-- THE PROCESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BASED ON AGREED 
TIMELINES IN PRIOR RESOLUTIONS; UNMOVIC,S AND IAEA\'S WORK 
HAD NOT CONCLUDED BUT WAS MERELY SUSPENDED. 
 
-- THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN RETURNING THE ISSUE OF 
IRAQ TO THE COUNCIL IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH A COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT. 
 
-- NO PRIOR COUNCIL DECISIONS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF FORCE 
OUTSIDE THE UN CHARTER OR APPROVED THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF 
THE LEADERSHIP OF A SOVEREIGN STATE.  SUCH ACTIONS WOULD NOT 
HELP STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION/SOLIDARITY 
NEEDED ON TERRORISM. 
 
-- A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT NEEDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUFFERED A HUGE 
TRAGEDY; PRESIDENT PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO 
PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH AND EXTEND SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT; 
SINCERE FEELINGS HAD BEEN FELT BY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. 
 
-- IF WAR IN IRAQ WAS IN RESPONSE TO DIRECT THREATS TO THE 
SECURITY OF THE U.S., THEN RUSSIA WOULD BE PREPARED TO 
ASSEMBLE ALL MEANS TO ELIMINATE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL 
WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO SUBSTANTIATE SUCH CLAIMS. 
 
 
CHINA: INSPECTIONS STILL POSSIBLE? 
----------------------------------- 
 
17. (C) IN A SLIGHTLY UNREAL INTERVENTION, CHINESE PERMREP 
WANG NOTED THAT UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA HAD SUBMITTED THE WORK 
PROGRAM AHEAD OF THE UNSCR 1284 SCHEDULE, AND OFFERED THE 
FOLLOWING COMMENTS: 
 
-- DUE TO RAPIDLY CHANGING EVENTS, THE EFFORTS OF THE COUNCIL 
HAD \"FALLEN BEHIND.\"  INSPECTIONS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED. 
 
-- IN LIGHT OF PROGRESS ON INSPECTIONS, IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE 
TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.  THE INSPECTORS HAD 
SUBMITTED THE WORK PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED SUGGESTIONS FOR 
MORE EFFECTIVE INSPECTIONS. 
 
-- THE SITUATION IN IRAQ WAS \"WORRISOME:\" A SITUATION IN 
WHICH WAR COULD BREAK OUT AT ANY MOMENT. 
 
-- CHINA HAD ALWAYS PURSUED A FOREIGN POLICY OF PEACE. 
 
-- CHINA WAS CONCERNED FOR PEACE AND SECURITY AND THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND WAS READY \"WITH THE 
COUNCIL\" TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE IRAQ ISSUE. 
 
-- THE COUNCIL BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEACE AND 
SECURITY AND MUST SHOULDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER NOT 
TO \"LET DOWN\" THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
 
GERMANY: \"WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS, BUT 
RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
18. (C) GERMAN FM FISCHER OFFERED A DECIDEDLY MORE EXPANSIVE 
STATEMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS COUNCIL MINISTERIAL MEETINGS; THE 
FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS IS REPORTED REF F.  HE SAID: 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD NOT \"REMAIN SILENT\" IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION; THE TASK AT HAND WAS TO SAFEGUARD ITS 
RELEVANCE AT A TIME WHEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAD BROUGHT THE 
WORK OF THE UN TO A STANDSTILL ON THE GROUND. 
 
-- PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ WAS STILL POSSIBLE DESPITE 
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WITHHOLDING RESOLUTION DEMANDS AND 
TIMELINES. 
 
-- TIME AND AGAIN, GERMANY HAD COLLABORATED WITH FRANCE AND 
RUSSIA TO PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR MORE EFFICIENT 
INSPECTIONS. 
 
-- REAL PROGRESS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED:  IRAQ HAD SCRAPPED MANY 
OF ITS AL-SAMOUD MISSILES; 70 HAD NOW BEEN DESTROYED. 
 
-- THAT SAID, IRAQ,S READINESS TO COOPERATE WAS 
UNSATISFACTORY; IT WAS HESITANT AND SLOW.  THE COUNCIL AGREED 
ON THAT, BUT CAN THIS BE GROUNDS FOR WAR WITH ALL ITS 
TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES? 
 
-- WHY SHOULD WE DISBAND NOW PLANS TO DISARM IRAQ VIA 
PEACEFUL MEANS?  THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS BELIEVED 
THERE WERE NO GROUNDS FOR BREAKING OFF THE DISARMAMENT 
PROCESS. 
 
-- THREE POINTS NEEDED TO BE EMPHASIZED:  FIRST, THE COUNCIL 
HAD NOT FAILED; WE \"MUST COUNTER THAT MYTH.\"  THE COUNCIL IS 
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE UN. 
SECOND, WE HAVE TO STATE CLEARLY THAT UNDER THE CURRENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES THE POLICY OF MILITARY INTERVENTION HAS NO 
CREDIBILITY; IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF OUR PEOPLE; IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN MUCH TO SAFEGUARD THE UNITY OF THE 
COUNCIL; THERE IS NO BASIS IN THE UN CHARTER FOR REGIME 
CHANGE WITH MILITARY MEANS.  THIRD, THE INSPECTION REGIME 
NEEDED TO BE PRESERVED; RESOLUTIONS 1284 AND 1441 WERE STILL 
IN FORCE. 
 
-- THE UN AND COUNCIL NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE CENTRAL 
ROLE IN THE IRAQ CONFLICT; THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE. 
 
-- NEGOTIATIONS ON THE IRAQ CRISIS, FOLLOWED BY MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, REVEALED HOW RELEVANT AND INDISPENSABLE THE 
PEACEMAKING ROLE OF THE COUNCIL IS. 
 
-- GERMANY IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN 
CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR IN IRAQ - THE WORLD\'S TASK NOW IS TO DO 
\"EVERYTHING POSSIBLE\" TO AVERT A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. 
 
-- A LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN GERMANY AND EUROPE ARE 
GREATLY TROUBLED BY THE IMPENDING WAR; EUROPE HAD EXPERIENCED 
THE HORRORS OF WAR ONLY TOO OFTEN.  THOSE WHO KNOW OUR 
EUROPEAN HISTORY UNDERSTAND THAT \"WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS 
BUT, RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS.\"  WAR IS TERRIBLE. 
 IT IS A GREAT TRAGEDY FOR THOSE AFFECTED AND FOR US ALL. 
 
-- NEVERTHELESS, GERMANY HAD ACCEPTED THE NECESSITY FOR WAR 
ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE ALL 
PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES HAD PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL:  IN KOSOVO AND 
IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
 
SYRIA: RHETORIC FLOWS, DOUBLE STANDARD 
ON ISRAEL, OBJECTIVE IS CONTROL OF OIL 
--------------------------------------- 
 
19. (C) SYRIAN FM SHARA MADE A LENGTHY RHETORICAL STATEMENT, 
SAYING: 
 
-- THIS WAS A SAD AND PAINFUL MOMENT.  NOTHING TO BE SAID 
COULD ADDRESS THE VICTIMS OF WAR. 
 
-- THE UN CHARTER OPENS:  \"WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, DETERMINED TO SAVE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS FROM THE 
SCOURGE OF WAR, WHICH TWICE IN OUR LIFETIME HAS BROUGHT 
UNTOLD SORROW TO MANKIND... UNITE OUR STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.\"  THIS WAS THE IMPORTANT 
COMMITMENT CONSECRATED IN THE CHARTER 58 YEARS AGO, SIGNED IN 
SAN FRANCISCO IN 1945.  A HISTORIC MONUMENT WAS BUILT TO THE 
CHARTER IN NEW YORK.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE BETWEEN 
THE EAST AND WEST COASTS ARE IN PLURALITY AND DIVERSITY A 
MICROCOSM OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, MORE THAN ANYWHERE 
ELSE IN THE WORLD. 
 
-- THE QUESTION WAS, WHETHER FOR IRAQ OR THE FORGOTTEN 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE, COULD THE U.S. AND THE UK ABSOLVE 
THEMSELVES OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME?  THE 
UN WAS WITNESS TO HISTORY.  COULD THE U.S. USE DIFFERENCES IN 
FINDING A CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTION IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS AN 
EXCUSE TO WAGE WAR?  WHEN WAS PEACE EASY? 
 
-- WITHIN HOURS, A WAR OF AGGRESSION WILL BE UNLEASHED, AS 
DECLARED IN WASHINGTON.  THOSE WITH VISION AND INSIGHT WILL 
DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS DECISION WOULD RETURN TO HAUNT... 
 
-- THIS WAR WAGED TO DISARM IRAQ OF WMD WAS INCONSISTENT WITH 
ISRAEL\'S STOCKPILE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IF INTERNATIONAL 
MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS PROCESSES MONITORED IRAQ, THEN 
SHOULD THEY NOT ALSO BE APPLIED TO ISRAEL\" 
 
-- SYRIA VOTED \"YES\" FOR 1441 BECAUSE IT BELIEVED IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL SOLUTION AND ULTIMATELY THE INTERNATIONAL 
INSPECTIONS PROCESS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. 
 
-- TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE ROLE OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR 
THE UN OR ANY ATTEMPT TO BLAME ANY MEMBER IGNORED THAT THE 
MAJORITY OF NATIONS REJECTED THE USE OF FORCE AND THERE WAS 
NO NEED TO VETO A RESOLUTION. 
 
-- UNSCR 1441\'S OP12, WHICH DEMANDED THAT THE COUNCIL BE 
CONVENED, WAS IGNORED.  THIS MADE CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTIVE 
WAS OCCUPATION AND EXPLOITATION OF IRAQI NATIONAL RESOURCES 
IN CONTRAVENTION OF ALL INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
-- HOW COULD ONE DENY THAT IRAQ WAS COOPERATING?  ALL HAD 
SEEN THE DESTRUCTION OF AL-SAMOUDS. 
 
-- AMERICAN RECORDS WHICH CITE DANGER TO U.S. INTERESTS AND 
AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES WITH AL-QAEDA 
SLEEPER CELLS ALSO INDICATE THE U.S. HAS THE BIGGEST ARSENAL 
OF WMD. 
 
-- IF THE U.S. FORGETS THE PALESTINIANS, HOW COULD IT FORGET 
RACHEL CORRIE, CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ISRAEL?  THE VIEWS OF 
MILLIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WERE CLEAR IN THE 
WORLD DEMONSTRATIONS. 
 
-- THE OPTION OF PEACE WAS STILL AVAILABLE.  THE PROSPERITY 
OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLES WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND COULD 
SAVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF IRAQI PEOPLE IN DEFIANCE OF THE 
OCCUPIER. 
 
 
PAKISTAN: TYPICAL NUANCE 
------------------------- 
 
20. (C) PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM SHOWED NO CARDS IN HIS 
INTERVENTION, NUANCING PAKISTAN\'S POSITION CAREFULLY.  WAR IS 
ALWAYS A HUMAN TRAGEDY, HE QUOTED THE SYG; PAKISTAN HAD THUS 
ADVOCATED A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND EXHAUSTING ALL OTHER MEANS 
BEFORE MOVING TO THE USE OF FORCE.  THE UNMOVIC / IAEA DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE PROVIDED A USEFUL BASIS FOR THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, \"IF IRAQ\'S FULL, ACTIVE, AND 
UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN SECURED IN TIME.\" 
IT WAS REGRETTABLE THAT \"OBVIOUSLY, THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK 
COULD NOT BE PURSUED AT THIS TIME.\"  RECALLING THAT, WHILE 
\"THE WHOLE WORLD HAD BEEN RIVETED ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL,\" 
MEMBERS SEPARATED BY \"HONEST DIFFERENCES\" HAD NOT BEEN \"IN A 
POSITION TO TRAVERSE THIS PATH TOGETHER;\" THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL NONETHELESS REMAINED RELEVANT AND MUST UPHOLD THE 
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD SEEK TO 
IMPLEMENT ALL ITS RESOLUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO 
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND KASHMIR, \"WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
STRUGGLED AND DIED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS,\" HE ADDED.  THAT 
SAID, THE COUNCIL WOULD BE REORIENTED IN THE DAYS TO COME BY 
URGENT HUMANITARIAN TASKS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, THE COUNCIL 
SHOULD CONSIDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SYG\'S HUMANITARIAN 
PROPOSALS WHEN RECEIVED.  PAKISTAN WOULD WORK IN SOLIDARITY 
WITH ITS IRAQI \"BROTHERS AND SISTERS\" TO ENSURE THAT THERE 
WOULD BE NO DELAY OR PROCRASTINATION TO EXACERBATE THEIR 
SUFFERING.  \"EVEN ONCE GUNS SPEAK,\" THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTAINING HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING, 
ENSURING UNITY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND THE STABILITY 
OF THE REGION AND WORLD WOULD NOT END.  THE PROCESS OF 
\"HEALING THE WOUNDS TO DATE AND TO COME COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED 
IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THROUGH THE UN.\" 
 
 
MEXICO: NOT TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT... 
DEFENSIVE OF THE COUNCIL 
------------------------------------------ 
 
21. (C) IN USUAL FASHION, MEXICAN PERMREP AGUILAR-ZINSER 
DEPLORED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE JOINTLY THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, BUT SAID THAT SITUATION DID NOT 
CONSTITUTE AN OBSTACLE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL\'S DISCHARGE OF 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE WORLD.  HE CONTINUED: 
 
-- MEXICO UPHOLDS A MULTILATERAL PATH FOR THE RESOLUTION OF 
CONFLICT; PRESIDENT FOX HAD SAID THE WORLD MUST CONTINUE TO 
UPHOLD THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE CHARTER.  THE USE OF 
FORCE WAS ONLY JUSTIFIED AS A LAST RESORT. 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS THE ONLY ORGAN TO WHICH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE RIGHT TO 
AUTHORIZE FORCE.  AT STAKE WAS THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH 
HUMANKIND ADDRESSES QUESTIONS OF WMD AND PROLIFERATION. 
 
-- MEXICO WAS A DEEPLY PACIFIST AND PEACEFUL STATE.  THE 
TOUCHSTONE OF THE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH MEXICO ADHERED WAS THE 
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES AND THE MULTILATERAL 
APPLICATION OF POLICY. 
 
-- THE UN WAS THE FORUM \"PAR EXCELLENCE\" WHICH PRESERVES OR 
RESTORES PEACE, WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN OR 
CHILDREN OR THE DISABLED, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE SPREAD AGAINST 
DISEASE, AND WHICH HAD THE STRENGTH AND LEGITIMACY OF ITS 
MANDATE. 
 
-- THIS CURRENT, MOST ROBUST ATTEMPT AT DISARMAMENT COULD 
HAVE SUCCEEDED.  THERE WAS NO TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT IT 
WAS TIME TO ANALYZE THE TASKS AHEAD WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF 
RESPONSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES AHEAD. 
 
 
CHILE: BITTER EXAMINATION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
22. (C) CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES SAID THAT CHILE HAD EXAMINED 
THE PROGRAM OF WORK WITH BITTERNESS BECAUSE \"WHAT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN WAS PEACE, AND THAT WAS NOT TO BE.\"  CHILE HAD WISHED 
FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO IDENTIFY A PATH 
TO THAT.  HE SAID: 
 
-- STRENGTHENED AND ACTIVE INSPECTIONS ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST 
MILITARY PRESSURE WERE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION. 
 
-- THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WERE SERIOUS FOR 
HUMANITY:  THE IRAQI REGIME NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PRICE IT 
WOULD HAVE TO PAY. 
 
-- EACH COUNCIL MEMBER MUST SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
FAILING TO FIND A PATH OF COLLECTIVE ACTION, ALTHOUGH TODAY 
WAS NOT A DAY FOR RECRIMINATION. 
 
-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED TRIBUTE, AS THEY WERE ABLE TO 
\"EXTRACT TRUTHS AND PLACE THEM BOLDLY\" BEFORE THE COUNCIL. 
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF INSPECTIONS; 
CHILE BELIEVED IN THE VALUE OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS AS A 
TOOL FOR DISARMAMENT. 
 
-- WAR WILL BRING HORROR UPON MILLIONS OF IRAQIS:  THE 
COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO SAVE LIVES. 
 
 
ANGOLA: IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY 
--------------------------- 
 
23. (C) ANGOLAN MINISTER MIRANDA DEPLORED THE FAILURE OF 
INSPECTIONS TO HAVE DISARMED IRAQ, AND DEPLORED AS WELL THAT 
IRAQ WAS UNABLE TO AVAIL ITSELF OF ITS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO 
COMPLY.  IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY WITH UNSCRS, IN PARTICULAR 1441, 
GOVERNING ITS PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, OR ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT WAS MAKING A GENUINE 
EFFORT TO DISARM.  ANGOLA DEFENDED PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO 
CONFLICT AND BELIEVED IN THE USE OF FORCE ONLY AS THE LAST 
RESORT.  FOUR DECADES OF CONFLICT IN ANGOLA HAD LED THEM TO 
THE PRIMACY OF THIS BELIEF.  IN ADDITION: 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
-- WAR IS NOW INEVITABLE; THEREFORE, THE HUMANITARIAN 
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE OF CONCERN, SINCE INNOCENTS WERE ALWAYS 
MOST AFFECTED BY WAR.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 
MUSTER THE RESOURCES FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO BE 
DEPLOYED WHEN THE CONFLICT WAS OVER. 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL, TOGETHER WITH THE BROADER UN SYSTEM, 
WOULD FACE THE IMMENSE TASK OF RECONSTRUCTION. 
 
 
CAMEROON: EACH AND EVERY ONE TO BLAME 
-------------------------------------- 
 
24. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU SAID THAT THE 
COUNCIL WAS AT A CROSS-ROADS, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN 
HOPE FOR A LAST MINUTE MIRACLE, A \"COLLECTIVE COMING TO OUR 
SENSES\" HAD NOT OCCURRED.  \"WE ARE EACH AND EVERY ONE TO 
BLAME; ALL WERE WRONG, AND ALL WERE RIGHT.\"  DISARMAMENT ON 
THE PRINCIPLE OF INSPECTIONS WAS OVER.  CAMEROON PAID HOMAGE 
TO THE INSPECTORS, WHO HAD JUSTIFIED THE TRUST PLACED IN 
THEM.  THE COUNCIL WOULD ENTRUST TO THEM NEW TASKS IN THE 
FUTURE, WHETHER IN THIS CONTEXT OR IN OTHERS.  THE DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD BASIS.  BUT DESPITE 
THE IDENTIFICATION OF KRDTS, CAMEROON DID NOT SEE HOW, ABSENT 
FULL, ACTIVE AND UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION ON THE PART OF 
IRAQ, THAT INSPECTIONS COULD HAVE COMPLETED THOSE TASKS.  THE 
COUNCIL MUST CONSIDER THE HUMANITARIAN IMPACT OF THE DE FACTO 
SUSPENSION OF THE OFF PROGRAM.  CAMEROON APPROVED THE SYG\'S 
DECISION TO REMOVE UN STAFF FOR THEIR SAFETY.  BUT GIVEN THE 
IMPACT ON THE IRAQI POPULATION, CAMEROON SUGGESTED THAT THE 
661 COMMITTEE MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT THE PERMREP LEVEL 
ON THE BASIS OF THE SYG\'S PROPOSALS (NOTE: WHICH ARE STILL 
FORTHCOMING.  END NOTE.).  FINALLY, CAMEROON HOPED THAT TRUST 
WITHIN THE COUNCIL COULD SOON BE REVIVED. 
 
 
GUINEA: MORAL NECESSITY TO RID WORLD OF WMD 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
25. (C) COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND GUINEAN FM FALL MADE AN 
EXTREMELY BRIEF STATEMENT IN HIS NATIONAL CAPACITY.  HE SAID: 
 
-- THE COUNCIL HAD EXAMINED BUT COULD NOT ACHIEVE CONSENSUS 
ON A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT 
SITUATION. 
 
-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED THE THANKS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE 
PROGRAM OF WORK AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE KRDTS. 
 
-- GUINEA NOTED THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW INSPECTORS 
BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY SITUATION. 
 
-- WAS THERE, THEN, NO ROOM FOR HOPE?  IF ARMED CONFLICT WAS 
INEVITABLE, STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO LIMIT THE MAGNITUDE OF 
THE RECONSTRUCTION TASK AND TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. 
 
-- GUINEA UNDERSTOOD THE MORAL NECESSITY OF RIDDING THE WORLD 
OF WMD.  SUCH ACTION WAS NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. 
 
-- MORE THAN EVER, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SEE SECURITY 
COUNCIL UNITY. 
 
 
IRAQ:  UNREPENTANT 
------------------ 
 
26. (U) AN UNREPENTANT IRAQI PR AL-DURI (FULL REMARKS IN REF 
G) THANKED COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT HAD OPPOSED THE U.S. / UK / 
SPANISH DRAFT RESOLUTION AND TOOK ON THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN 
FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THE COUNCIL.  HE SAID IRAQ HAD NO WMD 
AND THE COMING DAYS WOULD PROVE IT.  AL-DURI CRITICIZED U.S. 
AID PLANS FOR IRAQ, REMARKING THAT \"THE EXECUTIONER CANNOT 
HELP THE VICTIM EXCEPT BY KILLING HIM.\"  ELABORATING HE SAID 
THE IRAQI PEOPLE WOULD NOT NEED HUMANITARIAN AID BUT FOR 
IMMINENT U.S. / UK MILITARY ACTION.  HE REJECTED U.S. AID ON 
BEHALF OF IRAQ.  HE SAID THAT THE TRUE GOALS OF THE U.S. HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEARCH FOR WMD AND INSTEAD WERE 
FOCUSED ON OCCUPYING IRAQ AND CONTROLLING ITS OIL FIELDS.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, UNGA 
SUBJECT: 59TH UNGA: GENERAL ASSEMBLY PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE 
MEMORY OF YASSER ARAFAT 
 
1.  Summary.  On November 11, the United Nations General 
Assembly marked the passing of Yasser Arafat. 
Secretary-General (SYG) Kofi Annan and GA President Jean Ping 
both made statements of condolences as did the leaders of the 
various regional groups.   Gambia, on behalf of the African 
States; Indonesia, on behalf of the Asian States; Belarus, on 
behalf of the Eastern European States; Nicaragua, on behalf 
of the Latin American and Caribbean States; New Zealand, in 
its capacity as the Chairman of the Western Europe and Other 
States (WEOG); Sudan, on behalf of the Arab States; The 
Netherlands, on behalf of the EU; Malaysia, on behalf of the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM); Turkey, on behalf of the 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC); Senegal, in its 
capacity as Chairman of the Committee to Examine the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; Egypt; and the 
Palestinian Observer all gave statements,  The United States 
did not.  Several speakers recalled Arafat\'s first speech 
before the UNGA delivered almost 30 years to the day of his 
death, his signing of the Oslo Accords, his Noble Peace Prize 
in 1995, and his election as President of the Palestinian 
Authority.  Several states noted his confinement during the 
last years of his life to his compound in Ramallah.  Most 
expressed a hope that his dream of a Palestinian state, 
living side-by-side in peace with Israel, would be achieved 
and encouraged the international community, especially the 
Quartet, to take all steps to restart the Roadmap.  Following 
the statements, the Israeli delegate speaking to the GA on 
the next agenda item, stated it \"understands this is a day of 
profound sorrow for the Palestinian people,\" but hoped this 
could be an opportunity to pursue peace in the region.  He 
stated further, that the Palestinians are \"not our enemies, 
they are our neighbors, who deserve to live in peace as much 
as we do.\"  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
SYG Annan & President Ping 
-------------------------- 
2.  On November 11, 2004, SYG Annan stated to the General 
Assembly that Arafat \"expressed and symbolized\" the national 
aspirations of the Palestinian people.  He noted that Arafat 
led the Palestinians to the principle of peaceful coexistence 
between Israel and a future Palestinian state.  Annan stated 
it was tragic that Arafat did not live to see his dream 
fulfilled, but urged the international community to make even 
great efforts to bring about the peaceful realization of the 
Palestinian right to self-determination.  (Note:  Annan\'s 
embargoed written text referred to \"President\" Arafat; 
however, in his verbal statements Annan repeatedly 
substituted \"Chairman Arafat\" for \"President Arafat.\"  End 
Note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
Palestinian and Israeli Statements 
---------------------------------- 
3.  The Palestinian Deputy Observer, Somaia Barghouti, stated 
it was with \"great sorrow and sadness\" that the Palestinian 
leadership announced to the world the death of \"their leader, 
their teacher, their hero.\"  Noting that Arafat was a great 
world leader that placed the Palestinian people and their 
national rights at the front of the world agenda, Barghouti 
noted that Arafat leaves a legacy of a \"bright future for 
peace, freedom, and development\" for the Palestinian people. 
Barghouti thanked all \"friendly and fraternal\" states for 
their words of condolences, and noted that the Palestinian 
Mission would be open Monday and Tuesday from 10am-3pm to all 
missions wishing to express their condolences. 
 
4.  A representative for Israel speaking at the GA Hall on 
the following Plenary agenda item (Item 39(c) Humanitarian 
Assistance to the Palestinian People), stated that Israel 
\"understands this is a day of profound sorrow for the 
Palestinian People,\" but also said it was an opportunity to 
continue the quest for peace in the region.  He further 
stated that \"the Palestinians are not are enemies, they are 
our neighbors\" and asserted that both Palestinians and 
Israelis deserve to live in peace.  He touted Prime 
Minister\'s Sharon\'s \"disengagement plan\" recently ratified by 
the Knesset, would dismantle all military installations in 
Gaza by the end of 2005.  He quoted PM Sharon as \"willing to 
make painful compromises\" to achieve peace, and hoped the 
Palestinians and the Arab world would focus on \"creating a 
peaceful Palestinian state, instead of demolishing the 
Israeli one.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Egypt, the Arab States, the OIC, and NAM 
---------------------------------------- 
5.  The Egyptian Charge d\' Affaire Amr Aboul Atta stated that 
Arafat was the embodiment of the struggle for freedom and 
independence and asserted that he would be remembered with 
the likes of Ghandi and Mandela.  Aboul Atta lamented that 
\"fate\" did not allow Arafat to fulfill his dream of \"praying 
in Al Aqsa under the Palestinian flag,\" but stated the 
Palestinians would overcome their current struggles.  Atta 
noted that feelings of hate and desperation were intensifying 
in the Near East, but also said there was a ray of hope and 
asked the \"major powers\" to intervene to restart the peace 
process.  The Sudanese representative Omar Bashir Mohamed 
Manis, speaking on behalf of the Arab States, stated \"with 
heavy hearts, we are saddened by the loss of our brother,\" 
and claimed that the Palestinian cause was the cause of all 
Arabs.  Manis said the Palestinians were loosing a courageous 
and steadfast leader, who never wavered in his struggle, but 
he assured the Palestinians that Arafat\'s \"principles and 
positions will remain alive in us (the Arab States).\"  The 
Representative from Turkey, on behalf of the OIC, stated it 
was \"a sad day for humanity\" and called Arafat a \"valiant 
leader.\"  He noted that President Arafat epitomized the 
struggle of the Palestinian people.  The Turkish 
representative said that Arafat lit the flame of Palestinian 
Statehood, but the OIC would continue this goal until it was 
achieved.  The Representative from Malaysia, Rastam Mohd Isa, 
speaking on behalf of NAM, stated that President Arafat was 
not just a leader of Palestine, but also an influential 
leader in NAM.  Isa noted the \"indignity\" of President Arafat 
being imprisoned by the Israelis at his compound and reminded 
the members that at the time of his death, Arafat was the 
elected leader of his people, \"although certain Quartet 
members didn\'t want to recognize this.\"  Isa said he is 
confident his \"brothers\" in Palestine will remain calm during 
this period and stand united to face the challenges ahead. 
The Malaysian representative said NAM would \"continue to 
support the goal of a Palestinian State, living side-by-side 
in peace with Israel, until it is achieved,\" and he called on 
all member states, especially in the Quartet, to make sure 
\"Israel doesn\'t take advantage of the situation.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
The EU, Eastern European States, and WEOG 
----------------------------------------- 
6.  The Netherlands Permanent Representative Dirk Van den 
Berg, speaking on behalf of the EU, expressed the EU\'s 
condolences to the Palestinian leader for the loss of their 
leader and \"democratically elected President.\"  Van den Berg 
reassured the Palestinian people that they could count on the 
\"undiminished support of the EU on the path toward a 
peaceful, durable and just settlement of the conflict.\" 
Belarus, speaking on behalf of the Eastern European States, 
said Arafat would be remembered as a lifelong symbol of the 
struggle of the Palestinian people.  He continued saying that 
as a statesman, Arafat left an \"undeniable imprint, not just 
on the Middle East but also on the world\'s international 
political scene.  New Zealand PR Don Mackay, speaking in his 
capacity as chairman of the WEOG group (Note:  Mackay had to 
speak in his capacity as Chairman and not \"on behalf of WEOG\" 
because many states within the group, including Israel, were 
unable to receive formal guidance from their capitals on an 
official position. End Note) noted that Arafat had led the 
Palestinians to a historic acceptance of the principle of 
peaceful coexistence between Israel and a future Palestinian 
state.  Mackay said the Palestinian leadership would now have 
to shoulder the responsibility in carrying forward the vision 
of the two states living side-by-side in peace and security 
to fruition. 
 
------------------------------- 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America 
------------------------------- 
7.  The Indonesian representative, Rezlan Ishar Jenie, 
speaking on behalf of the Asian States, called Arafat the 
father of the Palestinian movement, who was only too familiar 
with the harshness of oppression.  He stated that when the 
\"ferocity of the campaign against the Palestinian people did 
not lessen over the years, Mr. Arafat matched it with the 
intensity of his spirit and undying optimism.\"  Jenie noted 
that his last days was spent as a virtual prisoner in 
Ramallah, and he claimed the flame for Palestinian freedom 
had not been extinguished by his death.  The Representative 
from Gambia, Crispin Grey-Johnson, speaking on behalf of the 
African States, said his delegation had been \"profoundly 
saddened by the death of Yasser Arafat,\" who was the 
\"personification\" of the Palestinians struggle for 
independence.  The Gambian representative stated Arafat had 
moved the question of Palestine from being a mere footnote on 
the international agenda to center stage of world affairs. 
Grey-Johnson also noted that he committed his life to the 
liberation of oppressed peoples everywhere.  The 
Representative from Nicaragua, Eduardo Sevilla Somoza, 
speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean 
States, called Arafat a \"historic\" figure that symbolized the 
struggle of his people until his very last breath.  Sevilla 
hoped the Palestinian people would continue to search for a 
free, sovereign and economically viable State dedicated to 
peace.  Senegal, in its capacity as Chairman of the Committee 
to Examine the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, 
also made a brief statement of condolences to the Palestinian 
People.

8.  The SYG announced that the UN Special Coordinator for the 
Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative to the 
Palestinian Authority, Terje Roed-Larsen, would represent the
