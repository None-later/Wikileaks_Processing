E.O. 12958: DECL: DECLASSIFIED BY NARA 09/02/2009 
TAGS: EFIS, PBTS, AR 
SUBJECT:  EXTENDED NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS OVER HIGH SEAS 
 
REF: STATE 106206 CIRCULAR; STATE CA-3400 NOV 2, 1966 
 
 
1.  PRESS REPORTS AND VARIETY EMBASSY SOURCES CONFIRM 
NEW ARGENTINE LEGISLATION UNILATERALLY CHANGING SEAS JURIS- 
DICTION NOW UNDER ADVANCED REVIEW.  REPORTEDLY LAW WOULD 
ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES 
OF EXCLUSIVE FISHING JURISDICTION, PLUS ANOTHER EXTENDED ZONE 
OF \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- 
LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28 
COUP WOULD HAVE DEFINED ZONE OF PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION 
AS \"EPICONTINENTAL SEA OUT TO 200 METER ISOBAR\".  IN SOUTHERN 
ARGENTINA THIS ZONE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES WIDE AND BLANKETS 
FALKLAND ISLANDS. 
 
2.  NAVATT STATES ARGENTINE NAVY THINKING OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OUT TO 200 MILES (AS IN PERU, ECUADOR, CHILE) 
RATHER THAN EPICONTINENTAL SEA.  200 MILE LIMIT DOES NOT 
RPT NOT REACH FALKLANDS.  ARGENTINE NAVY OFF TOLD NAVATT 
\"200 MILE LIMIT SOON WILL BE STANDARD THROUGH HEMISPHERE\". 
 
3.  FONOFF OFFICIALS REFERRING TO RECENT BRAZILIAN AND US 
LEGISLATION HAVE INFORMALLY INDICATED DECISION ALREADY 
FINAL RE SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA PLUS SIX MILE EXCLUSIVE 
FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" 
STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY 
SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED 
UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE 
LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY 
WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED 
AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS. 
 
4.  FONOFF LEGAL ADVISOR CONCEDES DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
\"EXCLUSIVE\" AND \"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION A SEMANTIC 
NICETY.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ZONE OF \"PREFERENTIAL\" JURIS- 
DICTION ARGENTINA WOULD CLAIM RIGHT TO TAX, LICENSE AND OTHER- 
WISE CONTROL ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXPLOITATION OF 
RESOURCES OF SEA. 
 
5.  DRAFT LEGISLATION ON SEAS JURISDICTION LAY DORMANT UNTIL 
SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL IN FISHIN ARGENTINE EPICONTINENTAL SEAS 
BY CUBAN AND EAST EUROPEAN (ESPECIALLY SOVIET) VESSELS PAST 
SIX MONTHS ALARMED ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES.  (SEE NAVATT IR 
5-804-0-140-66 OF NOV 18) NOT RPT NOT ALL SOVIET VESSELS WERE 
FISHING OR FACTORY TYPES.  FONOFF SOURCES INFORMALLY STATE 
ARMED FORCES PRESSURE MAKES EMISSION NEW LAW IMPERATIVE, QUITE 
POSSIBLY APPEARING WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WHEN ASKED BY FONOFF 
MEN ABOUT \"SECURITY PROBLEMS CREATED BY SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF US 
COAST\", EMBASSY OFF REPLIED US DID NOT RPT NOT SEE THAT 
UNILATERAL ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SEAS JURISDICTION OFFERED ANY 
REALISTIC SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEMS, WHILE SUCH 
ACTION COULD CREATE NEW SOURCES POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING AND 
CONFLICT. 
 
6.  RE PAR 3 STATE 106206 BELIEVE OUTLINED PROPOSAL MIGHT 
FORESTALL UNILATERAL ARGENTINE ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXTEND 
\"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION ONLY IF EMBASSY CAN BE 
AUTHORIZED DISCUSS IDEA WITH ARGENTINES IMMEDIATELY. EVEN THEN 
CHANCES SUCCESS LIMITED BY (A) ADVANCED STAGE PROPOSED ARGENTINE 
LAW AND (B) PRIMACY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARGENTINE THINKING. 
WE WOULD BENEFIT SOME FROM FONOFF LEGAL ADVISORS\' QUALMS ABOUT 
UNILATERAL ACTION, AND FROM RESTRAINT OF RECENT BRAZILIAN 
LEGISLATION WHICH DID NOT RPT NOT GO BEYOND 12-MILE LIMIT. 
 
7.  FOR DISCUSSION WITH ARGENTINES WOULD MODIFY TEXT IN STATE 
10942 CIRCULAR TO:  (A) MAKE ALL REFERENCES TO ARGENTINA, VICE 
CANADA; (B) REFER TO PROPOSED ARGENTINE CLAIMS OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OVER WATERS WE REGARD AS HIGH SEAS; (C) ELIMINATE 
REFERENCES TO \"TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER FISHERIES\", SINCE 
ARGENTINE COAST NOT RPT NOT TRADITIONAL FISHING ZONE (WHEREAS 
NO. 3);  (D) ADD NOTATION THERE NO TRADITIONAL FISHING AND 
CONFINE OPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS FOR NON-TRADITIONAL 
FISHING; (E) ELIMINATE LAST THREE PARS OF AIDE-MEMOIRE HANDED 
TO CANADIAN AMB. 
 
8.  IF AUTHORIZED, ENVISAGE TWO-STEP APPROACH TO FONOFF. 
FIRST, INFORMAL AND ORAL, STRESSING OUR INTEREST IN FREEDOM OF 
HIGH SEAS, NOTING EARLIER FONOFF CONFIRMATION NEW LAW UNDER 
STUDY, OUTLINING OUR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL TERMS.  ON BASIS 
FONOFF REACTION, WE WOULD THEN COUCH AIDE-MEMOIRE IN TERMS 
WHICH WOULD APPEAR MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  AT HIS REQUEST, AMBASSADOR AND POLCOUNS MET 
SEPTEMBER 14 WITH A LEADING MEMBER OF THE RADICAL 
CIVIC UNION, CESAR JAROSLAVSKY, FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT 
CUBA.  JAROSLAVSKY WAS INVOLVED LAST YEAR WITH A 
PERSONAL APPEAL TO FIDEL CASTRO FOR THE RELEASE OF 
CUBAN POLITICAL PRISONER MARIO CHAVES DE ARMAS AND FOR 
THE TRAVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST ELIZARDO SANCHEZ 
(REFTELS).  JAROSLAVSKY, WHO HAS GONE TO CUBA FOR SOME 
YEARS FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, IS REPORTEDLY A PERSONAL 
FRIEND OF CASTRO DESPITE HIS CENTRIST POLITICAL 
ORIENTATION. 
 
3.  WASTING LITTLE TIME, JAROSLAVSKY CAME RIGHT TO HIS 
POINT:  HE HAD RECENTLY SPENT SOME TIME WITH CASTRO IN 
HAVANA AND WISHED TO SHARE HIS IMPRESSIONS. 
JAROSLAVSKY WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HE SAW AS A SITUATION 
SPINNING OUT OF THE CONTROL OF FIDEL OR THE UNITED 
STATES.  ACCORDING TO JAROSLAVSKY, CASTRO IS NOW 
WILLING TO STEP ASIDE IF NECESSARY BECAUSE HE NOW 
REALIZES THAT CUBA\'S CRISIS CANNOT CONTINUE WITHOUT 
DANGER OF A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN AND/OR A COUP LED BY 
SECURITY FORCES.  CASTRO REPORTEDLY SEES NATIONAL 
ELECTIONS AS THE WAY OUT OF CUBA\'S CURRENT DILEMMA BUT 
CANNOT ENVISION HOW ELECTIONS COULD TAKE PLACE GIVEN 
CURRENT SOCIAL TENSIONS AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.  CASTRO 
REPORTEDLY BELIEVES THAT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
(I.E., APPARENTLY A VOTE IN WHICH HE HAS A CHANCE TO 
WIN) COULD NOT BE HELD UNTIL AT LEAST A MODICUM OF 
STABILITY AND BASIC ECONOMIC NECESSITIES (FOOD) CAN BE 
GUARANTEED. 
 
4.  JAROSLAVSKY COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS NOT A PLEA FOR 
THE U.S. TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA; 
HE REALIZED THAT U.S. POLICY WAS NOT LIKELY TO SHIFT 
WITHOUT CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF REFORM IN CUBA.  HOWEVER, 
A TRANSITION WAS UNDERWAY IN CUBA WHICH WOULD GO DOWN 
ONE OF TWO PATHS:  GENUINE POPULAR ELECTIONS AND 
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY, OR SOCIAL CHAOS AND A 
LIKELY MILITARY/SECURITY REGIME POSING A FAR GREATER 
THREAT TO THE U.S. THAN CASTRO DOES TODAY. 
JAROSLAVSKY BELIEVED THE U.S. WOULD HELP THIS 
TRANSITION COME OUT THE \"RIGHT WAY\" JUST BY ALLOWING, 
FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITED DONATIONS BY OTHER FOOD 
EXPORTERS, SUCH AS ARGENTINA, TO CUBA.  ALLOWING BASIC 
THIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE TO OCCUR DISCREETLY WOULD NOT 
SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE TOUGH U.S. LINE TOWARD CUBA 
AND WOULD PROVIDE A REAL TEST OF CASTRO\'S WILLINGNESS 
TO PROVE HIS REGIME\'S POPULARITY AT THE BALLOT BOX. 
JAROSLAVSKY CITED THE EXAMPLE OF GORBACHEV FACING A 
NEARLY SUCCESSFUL MILITARY COUP AS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF 
WHAT MIGHT WELL BE THE ALTERNATIVE IN CUBA. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  JAROSLAVSKY\'S BASIC MESSAGE--ONE OFTEN 
HEARD IN LATIN AMERICA--WAS THAT LESS HEAT ON CASTRO 
WOULD MAKE HIM MOVE TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC TEST OF 
SUPPORT FOR HIS REGIME.  WE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT MANY 
BELIEVED IT MIGHT BE JUST AS OR MORE LIKELY TO STIFFEN 
RESISTANCE TO REFORM.  JAROSLAVSKY STRESSED, WITH 
SCARCELY A WINK, THAT HE WAS NOT THE BEARER OF ANY 
MESSAGE FROM CASTRO TO THE UNITED STATES.  WITH THE 
CASTRO REGIME CLEARLY TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF A 
TERRIBLE SITUATION, SUCH PLEAS FOR BREATHING ROOM ARE 
LIKELY TO PROLIFERATE IN CASTRO\'S THOUSANDS OF 
\"PERSONAL CHANNELS\" THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  THE 
ABILITY OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO ORGANIZE ELECTIONS 
UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE DOUBTFUL.  OF 
COURSE, IT IS JUST AS EASY TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THEIR 
CONVERSION TO DEMOCRACY IN THE THROES OF ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL CRISIS.  AMBASSADOR TOLD JAROSLAVSKY THAT WE 
WOULD PASS HIS COMMENTS TO WASHINGTON; HE RESPONDED 
THAT HE EXPECTED NO ANSWER AND HOPED ONLY TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO A PEACEFUL POLITICAL TRANSITION TO 
DEMOCRACY IN CUBA WHICH WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF 
ALL.

REF:  (A) BUENOS AIRES 289, (B) BUENOS AIRES 247 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: QADHAFI\'S 25-YEAR OLD SON ALSADI AND AN 
ENTOURAGE OF FIVE OR SIX UNIDENTIFIED LIBYAN OFFICIALS 
ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA LATE LAST WEEK AND WAS RECEIVED 
BY PRESIDENT MENEM AT THE OLIVOS RESIDENCE ON JULY 
24.  GOA OFFICIALS STRESS THAT QADHAFI\'S VISIT WAS 
COMPLETELY PRIVATE.  DESPITE SOME PRESS SPECULATION 
ABOUT A \"THAWING\" IN ARGENTINA\'S RELATIONS WITH THE 
PARIAH STATE, QADHAFI THE YOUNGER REPORTEDLY TOUCHED 
ON LITTLE OR NO SUBSTANCE DURING THE TWENTY-FIVE 
MINUTES HE SPENT WITH ARGENTINA\'S HEAD OF STATE;  MOST 
OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER REPORTEDLY WAS DEVOTED TO 
CHIT-CHAT ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SPORTS WORLD.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN A MEETING LASTING LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR, 
PRESIDENT MENEM RECEIVED THE SON OF LIBYAN LEADER 
MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI, ALSADI MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI, AT HIS 
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE WHILE THE LATTER WAS ON A \"PRIVATE 
VISIT\" ARGENTINA.  OSTENSIBLY HERE TO DISCUSS 
BROADENING BILATERAL COMMERCE, QADHAFI\'S SON FOLLOWED 
BY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AN UNSUCCESSFUL MISSION BY A 
QADHAFI ENVOY SEEKING ARGENTINE SUPPORT FOR EASING 
SANCTIONS ON LIBYA IMPOSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS 
(REPORTED REFTELS).  AS REPORTED IN LOCAL PRESS, 
HOWEVER, THE SHORT AUDIENCE WITH MENEM PRODUCED THE 
SAME FROSTY RESULTS AS THE JANUARY VISIT.  MENEM\'S 
PENCHANT FOR SPORTS AND DISCUSSION OF INTERNATIONAL 
SOCCER COMPETITION -- AND PERHAPS A DESIRE TO AVOID 
TOO MUCH SUBSTANCE -- APPARENTLY CAPTURED THE BULK OF 
THE CONVERSATION.  DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PETRELLA 
AND A LIBYAN \"COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS OFFICER\" ALSO 
ATTENDED THE MEETING. 
 
4.  POLOFF CALLED ON JOSE LUIS MIGNINI, SUBDIRECTOR 
FOR NORTH AFRICA AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, JULY 25 TO 
GET A READ OUT ON THE MEETING AND TO ENQUIRE ABOUT 
CURRENT RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND LIBYA. 
MIGNINI SAID HE HAD LITTLE LIGHT TO SHED ON THE 
MEETING AS PETRELLA\'S OFFICE WAS NOT DIVULGING DETAILS 
OF THE DISCUSSION.  HE SPECULATED THAT PRESS REPORTS 
HAD CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF THE CONVERSATION AS NO 
CHANGES IN ARGENTINA\'S POSITION REGARDING LIBYA\'S 
STATUS IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY WERE ANTICIPATED.  IN A 
SEPARATE CONVERSATION, PETRELLA\'S CHIEF OF CABINET ANA 
MARIA RAMIREZ CONFIRMED THAT THE CONVERSATION DWELLED 
ON PROTOCOL.  THIS WAS THE YOUTHFUL QADHAFI\'S FIRST 
VISIT TO LATIN AMERICA, ACCORDING TO RAMIREZ, AND HE 
BROUGHT NO MESSAGES FROM HIS GOVERNMENT.  SHE 
CONFIRMED THAT SPORTS DOMINATED THE DISCUSSION. 
 
5. COMMENT.  DESPITE THE HOOPLA IN THE PRESS -- ONE 
PAPER PAINTED THE MEETING AS A LOGICAL FOLLOW-ON TO 
MENEM\'S VISIT TO SYRIA IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO 
REESTABLISH WARMER TIES TO ARAB COUNTRIES AFTER 
ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE GULF WAR -- LITTLE 
APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED AFTER QADHAFI\'S VISIT. 
ARGENTINA\'S COMMITMENT TO UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA 
APPEARS UNWAVERING EVEN IF PRESIDENT MENEM ALSO SEEMS 
UNABLE TO RESIST MEETING WITH \"CELEBRITIES\" RANGING 
FROM THE ROLLING STONES TO QADHAFI\'S SON.

THE COMPOSITION OF HIS CABINET ON MAY 20.  AS KIRCHNER HAD 
STATED DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ROBERTO LAVAGNA WILL CONTINUE ON

MINISTER AND MEDICAL DOCTOR AND STAUNCH DUHALDISTA JOSE 
PAMPURO AS DEFENSE MINISTER, GIVEN THAT NEITHER HAS MUCH 
EXPERIENCE IN EITHER AREA.  CLOSE KIRCHNER ASSOCIATE ALBERTO 
FERNANDEZ, WHO WAS THE EMBASSY\'S CLOSEST CONTACT IN THE 
KIRCHNER CAMPAIGN, WILL SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  OF THE 13 
CABINET-LEVEL APPOINTMENTS, FIVE ARE LOYAL KIRCHNER 
ASSOCIATES, FOUR ARE CARRYOVERS FROM THE DUHALDE 
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE REMAINING FOUR ARE MORE POLITICALLY 
INDEPENDENT - ORIENTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT KIRCHNER\'S CABINET 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT NESTOR KIRCHNER ANNOUNCED THE MAKEUP 
OF HIS CABINET ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 20 FROM HIS HOME 
PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ, WHERE HE HAS SERVED AS GOVERNOR FOR 
THE PAST 12 YEARS. 
 
-- THE ONLY STRUCTURAL INNOVATION IN KIRCHNER\'S CABINET WILL 
BE THE CREATION OF A MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT, AND SERVICES -- REFLECTING KIRCHNER\'S PREFERENCE 
AS SANTA CRUZ GOVERNOR FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.  TO 
ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE, THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTION WILL 
REVERT TO ITS PREVIOUS STATUS AS PART OF THE MINISTRY OF 
ECONOMY.  IN ADDITION, THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE 
AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BE CALLED THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE.  (UNDER THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION, THE CHIEF OF 
CABINET PRESIDES OVER A CABINET OF TEN OTHER MINISTERS.  THE 
POSTS OF SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY AND SECRETARY OF 
STATE INTELLIGENCE ARE LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS CABINET-LEVEL 
POSTS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING CABINET POSTS 
AS THE CONSTITUTION DEFINES IT.) 
 
-- AT LEAST FIVE OF THE APPOINTMENTS ARE CLOSE KIRCHNER 
ASSOCIATES.  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ, HIS CLOSEST ADVISOR (OTHER 
THAN PERHAPS HIS WIFE CHRISTINA FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER), WILL 
SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  THE OTHERS INCLUDE JULIO DE VIDO 
(FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES), 
PRESIDENTIAL SISTER ALICIA KIRCHNER (SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT), 
OSCAR PARRILLI (SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY), AND 
SERGIO ACEVEDO (SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE). 
 
-- KIRCHNER RETAINED FOUR OF DUHALDE\'S HIGH-RANKING 
OFFICIALS.  HOWEVER, ECONOMY MINISTER ROBERTO LAVAGNA AND 
HEALTH MINISTER GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN 
CHOSEN MORE ON THEIR OWN MERITS THAN FOR ANY TIES THEY MIGHT 
HAVE HAD WITH DUHALDE.  THE TWO DIEHARD DUHALDE LOYALISTS IN 
KIRCHNER\'S CABINET WILL BE JOSE PAMPURO (DEFENSE, FORMERLY 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY) AND ANIBAL FERNANDEZ 
(INTERIOR, FORMERLY MINISTER OF PRODUCTION). 
 
-- KIRCHNER SELECTED TWO CURRENT MAYORAL CANDIDATES FOR THE 
FEDERAL CAPITAL TO HIS CABINET, RAFAEL BIELSA (FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS) AND GUSTAVO BELIZ (JUSTICE).  CHOOSING BOTH OF THEM 
TO HIS CABINET GIVES KIRCHNER MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT 
CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA IN THE AUGUST 24 ELECTIONS, WHERE 
IBARRA WILL COMPETE AGAINST THE FRONTRUNNER, BUSINESSMAN 
MAURICO MACRI.  A MEMBER OF IBARRA\'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE 
FEDERAL CAPITAL, MINISTER OF EDUCATION DANIEL FILMUS, WILL 
SERVE IN KIRCHNER\'S CABINET AS WELL. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
KIRCHNER\'S CABINET: BIOGRAPHICAL COMMENTS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  CHIEF OF CABINET:  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ.  FERNANDEZ IS 
A 44-YEAR-OLD LOCAL PJ LEGISLATOR IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES 
AND AN EXPERT IN CRIMINAL LAW WITH A PRIVATE LAW PRACTICE. 
HE HAS DIRECTED KIRCHNER\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN EFFORT FROM 
THE BEGINNING AND HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF KIRCHNER\'S CLOSEST 
ADVISORS.  IN THE LATE 1980S, HE HELD MID-LEVEL POSTS IN THE 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, AND IN 1989, WAS NAMED NATIONAL 
SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE.  DURING 1996-2000, HE SERVED AS 
VICE PRESIDENT FOR BAPRO, ONE OF THE GOVERNING ENTITIES OF 
THE BANCO DE LA PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES.  HE WAS FIRST 
ELECTED TO THE CITY LEGISLATURE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL IN 
2000.  POLOFFS HAVE FOUND FERNANDEZ TO BE ARTICULATE AND 
FORTHCOMING INTERLOCUTOR, AND QUITE OPEN TO PRIVATE MEETINGS 
WITH THE EMBASSY -- IN STARK CONTRAST TO KIRCHNER. 
 
4.  (C)  MINISTER OF INTERIOR:  ANIBAL FERNANDEZ.  PRIOR TO 
BECOMING DUHALDE\'S MINISTER OF PRODUCTION IN OCTOBER 2002, HE 
SERVED AS PRESIDENT DUHALDE\'S FIRST SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE 
PRESIDENCY, A HIGH-PROFILE JOB (RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENTIAL SPENDING AND POLICY 
ARTICULATION WITH OTHER MINISTERS) DURING A TURBULENT PERIOD 
IN ARGENTINE HISTORY.  FERNANDEZ GAINED POLITICAL PROMINENCE 
IN THE BUENOS AIRES PJ MACHINE BY SERVING AS MAYOR OF THE 
WORKING CLASS BUENOS AIRES SUBURB OF QUILMES AND LATER, IN 
2001, AS THEN-GOVERNOR CARLOS RUCKAUF\'S MINISTER OF LABOR. 
HE FACED DRAMATIC CONFRONTATIONS DURING HIS TENURE AS MAYOR 
AND PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, INCLUDING HAVING FACED CHARGES 
OF CORRUPTION AND HAVING BEEN BRIEFLY HELD HOSTAGE IN THE 
MINISTRY BY PIQUETERO FAMILIES DEMANDING RENEWAL OF JOB 
SUBSIDIES.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE CHARGES WERE NEVER 
FULLY SUBSTANTIATED, EMBASSY CONTACTS ALLEGED THAT WHILE 
PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, FERNANDEZ AND OTHER PJ PROVINCIAL 
LEADERS NOT ONLY REMAINED PASSIVE WHILE THE LOOTINGS AND 
VIOLENCE RAGED IN DECEMBER 2001 AND ULTIMATELY LED TO 
PRESIDENT FERNANDO DE LA RUA\'S RESIGNATION, BUT ACTIVELY 
STIMULATED THE UNREST.  THE 46-YEAR-OLD FERNANDEZ IS A PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTANT AND LAWYER BY TRAINING.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, 
THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S CHIEF RESPONSIBILITY IS MANAGING 
THE GOA\'S CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVINCES.  (THIS 
AND ADDITIONAL BIO INFORMATION ON FERNANDEZ WAS PREVIOUSLY 
REPORTED IN REF A). 
 
5.  (U)  MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND 
WORSHIP:  RAFAEL BIELSA.  A LAWYER BY TRAINING, BIELSA IS AN 
EXPERT IN JUDICIAL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND A 
STRONG ADVOCATE FOR JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY.  HIS PERONIST 
CREDENTIALS DATE BACK TO THE 1970S, BUT HE AFFILIATED WITH 
FREPASO, A PERONIST SPLINTER GROUP, IN THE 1990S.  DURING THE 
DE LA RUA ADMINISTRATION, BIELSA SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE NATIONAL COMPTROLLER\'S OFFICE.  HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST 
DE LA RUA\'S INTELLIGENCE SECRETARY FERNANDO DE SANTIBANEZ FOR 
MISUSING FUNDS LED TO THE LATTER\'S RESIGNATION IN OCTOBER 
2000.  THE 50-YEAR-OLD BIELSA RECEIVED HIS LAW DEGREE FROM 
THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES AND ALSO STUDIED AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.  HIS BROTHER MARCELO IS THE COACH OF 
THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM.  BIELSA WAS A SURPRISE 
CHOICE FOR THIS POST, HAVING BEEN RUMORED INSTEAD AS 
KIRCHNER\'S MINISTER OF JUSTICE.  HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE 
ANY FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXPERIENCE.  A SENIOR FOREIGN MINISTRY 
OFFICIAL ANTICIPATES HE WILL KEEP MARTIN REDRADO ON AS DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER. 
 
6.  (U)  MINISTER OF DEFENSE:  JOSE PAMPURO.  AS REPORTED IN 
REF B, PAMPURO SERVED AS DUHALDE\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY IN 2002, 
BECOMING SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY IN OCTOBER OF 
THAT YEAR.  A MEDICAL SURGEON BY TRAINING, HE WAS MINISTER OF 
HEALTH OF THE PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES DURING DUHALDE\'S 
TENURE AS GOVERNOR IN THE 1990S.  HE ALSO SERVED PREVIOUSLY 
AS A NATIONAL DEPUTY IN THE LATE 1980S.  HE AND DUHALDE HAVE 
KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 20 YEARS, AND HE ENJOYS THE CONFIDENCE 
OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE ONCE 
DECLARED, \"I AM DUHALDE.\"  THE 53-YEAR-OLD PAMPURO SPEAKS 
ENGLISH AND ONCE TOOK A SIX-MONTH SPECIALIZATION COURSE AT 
MT. SINAI HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK. 
 
7.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND PRODUCTION:  ROBERTO 
LAVAGNA.  DUHALDE\'S CURRENT MINISTER OF ECONOMY WAS THE ONLY 
NAME EXPLICITLY ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE BY THEN-CANDIDATE 
KIRCHNER PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.  ONE INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF 
KIRCHNER\'S CAMPAIGN TOLD EMBASSY OFFICERS THAT KIRCHNER HAS 
MET WITH LAVAGNA FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR PER DAY SINCE KIRCHNER 
ANNOUNCED THAT LAVAGNA WOULD BE HIS CHOICE FOR ECONOMY 
MINISTER. 
 
8.  (C)  MINISTER OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND 
SERVICES:  JULIO DE VIDO.  WHILE SERVING AS KIRCHNER\'S 
MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT OF SANTA CRUZ, DE VIDO COORDINATED THE 
TECHNICAL TEAM THAT PREPARED THE CANDIDATE\'S PLAN OF 
GOVERNMENT (SEPTEL).  DE VIDO WAS BORN IN SANTA CRUZ AND IS 
CONSIDERED CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.  HE FORMERLY SERVED 
AS THE PROVINCIAL MINISTER OF ECONOMY UNDER KIRCHNER.  DURING 
A MAY 14 MEETING WITH ECONCOUNS, DE VIDO STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE THAT THE KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION WOULD PAY TO 
RUNNING A PRIMARY FISCAL SURPLUS \"FROM DAY ONE.\" 
 
9.  (U)  MINISTER OF JUSTICE, SECURITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS: 
GUSTAVO BELIZ.  ONCE VIEWED AS FORMER PRESIDENT CARLOS 
MENEM\'S PROTEGE BEFORE THEIR FALLING OUT, BELIZ WAS NAMED 
MENEM\'S INTERIOR MINISTER IN 1992 WHILE ONLY 30 YEARS OLD. 
HE RESIGNED THE POST A YEAR LATER, ALLEGING THAT HIS EFFORTS 
TO CLEAN UP THE MINISTRY\'S ADMINISTRATION WERE BEING THWARTED 
BY OTHERS IN THE GOVERNMENT.  A PERSISTENT CRITIC OF 
CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF THE JUDICIARY, HE 
RESIGNED HIS PJ PARTY MEMBERSHIP IN EARLY 1996.  UNDER HIS 
OWN \"NEW LEADERSHIP PARTY\" BANNER, HE RAN A SURPRISINGLY 
STRONG BUT UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN FOR MAYOR OF THE FEDERAL 
CAPITAL THAT YEAR.  IN 2000, HE RAN AS DOMINGO CAVALLO\'S 
RUNNING MATE IN THE MAYORAL RACE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, BUT 
CAVALLO WAS DEFEATED BY CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA.  BELIZ\'S 
ATTEMPT TO WIN A NATIONAL SENATE SEAT FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL 
IN 2001 ENDED UP IN A STILL-UNRESOLVED COURT DISPUTE WITH 
SOCIALIST CANDIDATE ALFREDO BRAVO.  THE 40-YEAR-OLD BELIZ HAS 
A LAW DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES.  IN THE 
PRESS, BELIZ\'S AUSTERE LIFESTYLE AND DEVOUT CATHOLICISM ARE 
HIS TWO MOST FREQUENTLY CITED PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES. 
 
10.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE:  DANIEL FILMUS. 
THE 47-YEAR-OLD FILMUS IS CURRENTLY SECRETARY OF EDUCATION 
FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, WHERE HIS WORK WAS PRAISED BY 
THEN-CANDIDATE KIRCHNER.  FILMUS RECEIVED HIS UNDERGRADUATE 
DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1977 AND HIS 
MASTERS DEGREE FROM THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY FLUMINENSE 
(BRAZIL) IN 1989. 
 
11.  (U)  MINISTER OF LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY: 
CARLOS TOMADA.  THE LAWYER TOMADA HAS SERVED IN VARIOUS 
POSITIONS IN THE LABOR MINISTRY OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING 
HAVING HEADED THE SECTION CHARGED WITH RESOLVING LABOR - 
MANAGEMENT DISPUTES.  MOST RECENTLY, HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF 
LABOR -- ESSENTIALLY, DEPUTY MINISTER -- IN THE FIRST FEW 
MONTHS OF THE DUHALDE GOVERNMENT UNDER THEN-MINISTER ALFREDO 
ATANASOF.  TOMADA RESIGNED THAT POSITION WHEN ATANASOF LEFT 
THE MINISTRY TO BECOME CHIEF OF STAFF AND GRACIELA CAMANO 
BECAME MINISTER.  TOMADA HAS HIS OWN LAW OFFICE AND, AS A 
PROFESSOR, HAS HEADED THE LABOR RELATIONS PROGRAM OF THE 
SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES. 
IN 1990, THE EMBASSY SENT TOMADA ON AN INDIVIDUAL 
INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM, AND HE HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH 
EMBASSY LABOR ATTACHES SINCE THEN, PARTICULARLY IN PROMOTING 
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION, SUCH AS MEDIATION AND 
CONCILIATION.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, THE POST OF LABOR 
MINISTER IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MINISTRY HAS 
ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF MANY OF THE 
EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OVER 2 MILLION 
BENEFICIARIES IN THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD SUBSIDY ALONE. 
 
12.  (U)  MINISTER OF HEALTH:  GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA. 
PRESIDENT DUHALDE APPOINTED GONZALEZ GARCIA AS HIS MINISTER 
OF HEALTH IN OCTOBER 2002.  DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 
KIRCHNER HAD GIVEN SIGNALS THAT GONZALEZ GARCIA WOULD STAY IN 
THAT POST WERE HE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, LARGELY BECAUSE OF 
THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ACCLAIM HE ENJOYED AS A RESULT OF HIS 
POLICIES TO LOWER DRUG PRICES.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT 
THE 57-YEAR-OLD MINISTER-DESIGNATE HAS A LONG-STANDING 
ACQUAINTANCE WITH KIRCHNER.  GONAZALEZ GARCIA RECEIVED HIS 
MEDICAL DEGREE FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF CORDOBA IN 
1968 AND IS A MEMBER OF NUMEROUS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN 
ARGENTINA AND ABROAD, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN MEDICAL 
ASSOCIATION. 
 
13.  (U)  MINISTER OF SOCIAL ACTION:  ALICIA KIRCHNER. 
KIRCHNER\'S OLDER SISTER CURRENTLY SERVES IN THIS CAPACITY IN 
KIRCHNER\'S GUBERNATORIAL ADMINISTRATION IN SANTA CRUZ. 
ALICIA KIRCHNER HAD BEEN RUMORED FOR THIS POSITION FOR THE 
PAST SEVERAL DAYS; THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\'S ONLY DOUBTS 
REPORTEDLY CONCERNED THE ADVISABILITY OF NAMING A RELATIVE TO 
A CABINET POST. 
 
14.  (U)  SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY:  OSCAR 
PARRILLI.  KIRCHNER\'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR IN THE PROVINCE OF 
NEUQUEN, PARRILLI IS AN EX-NATIONAL DEPUTY AND PROVINCIAL 
LAWMAKER.  ALONG WITH KIRCHNER\'S WIFE, SENATOR CHRISTINA 
FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER, HE STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE VIOLENCE 
FOMENTED BY PJ SENATOR LUIS BARRIONUEVO IN CATAMARCA IN EARLY 
MARCH 2002 THAT LED TO THE POSTPONEMENT OF PROVINCIAL 
ELECTIONS THERE.  OF ALL THE PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY 
KIRCHNER, PARRILLI IS PERHAPS THE LEAST KNOWN. 
 
15.  (C)  SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE (SIDE):  SERGIO 
ACEVEDO.  ACEVEDO IS A 47-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL DEPUTY FROM 
KIRCHNER\'S HOME PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ AND HAS SERVED IN 
RECENT YEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE IN 
THE LOWER HOUSE.  IN THAT CAPACITY, HE SPEARHEADED EFFORTS IN 
2002 TO IMPEACH ALL NINE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN 
EFFORT THAT ULTIMATELY FELL SHORT OF THE TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY 
NEEDED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE DUHALDE 
ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS INITIAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
IMPEACHMENT EFFORT.  ACEVEDO FIRST SERVED IN THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES DURING THE PERIOD 1995-1999, THEN SERVED AS 
KIRCHNER\'S VICE GOVERNOR IN SANTA CRUZ DURING 1999-2001, 
BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES IN 2001.  ACEVEDO 
IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING, HAVING RECEIVED HIS DEGREE FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1979.  AS HEAD OF ARGENTINA\'S 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, ACEVEDO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BOTH 
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ESPIONAGE; SIDE ALSO IS AN IMPORTANT 
ELEMENT IN GOA COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS.  SIDE HAS A LONG 
HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN DOMESTIC POLITICS FOR WHICH IT 
UTILIZES A LARGE NON-TRANSPARENT BUDGET PROCESS TO SUPPORT 
THE PRESIDENT\'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  HIS APPOINTMENT IS 
CLEARLY BASED MORE ON THE FACT THAT HE IS A CLOSE CONFIDANT 
OF KIRCHNER THAN ON ANY BACKGROUND IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS. 
HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE LEFT WING OF THE PERONIST PARTY AND 
HIS RUMORED HISTORY AS A FORMER MONTENERO GUERRILLA IN THE 
1970S, RAISE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HIS INCLINATIONS ON FOREIGN 
INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION.

SPEECH BUT PURGES MILITARY LEADERSHIP

CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL COUNSELOR MICHAEL MATERA.  REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  NESTOR KIRCHNER\'S MAY 25 INAUGURAL ADDRESS 
WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS CAMPAIGN MESSAGES ADVOCATING A 
GREATER STATE ROLE IN THE ECONOMY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
MAINTAINING FISCAL DISCIPLINE.  HE REPEATED HIS CAMPAIGN 
PROMISE TO GIVE PROMINENCE OF PLACE TO ARGENTINA\'S RELATIONS 
WITH OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, BEGINNING WITH MERCOSUR. 
 THE MODERATE TONE OF THE SPEECH WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO HIS 
FIRST REAL ACTION AS PRESIDENT, IN WHICH HE NAMED A GENERAL 
SERVING IN SANTA CRUZ PROVINCE TO HEAD THE ARMY, A MOVE 
WHICH, ACCORDING TO MILITARY NORMS OF PROMOTION, WILL MEAN 
THE DISMISSAL OF CLOSE TO HALF OF THE GENERALS IN THE ARMY. 
IN THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY, KIRCHNER INTENDS TO PROMOTE JUNIOR 
FLAG OFFICERS AS SERVICE CHIEFS AS WELL, WHICH WILL ALSO 
PRODUCE MASS DISMISSALS IN THOSE SERVICES.  MEMBERS OF THE 
KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION ALSO HINTED THAT THEY WOULD NOT STAND 
IN THE WAY OF CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO IMPEACH THE MEMBERS OF 
THE SUPREME COURT, AN ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD COULD LEAD TO 
CONTINUED FIGHTING AMONG THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT 
REMINISCENT OF THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION.  FIDEL CASTRO\'S VISIT TO BUENOS AIRES 
FOR THE INAUGURATION PROMPTED LARGE GATHERINGS AND AN 
OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN LEADER.  IN A 
PRESS INTERVIEW, FOREIGN MINISTER BIELSA REFUSED TO CRITICIZE 
CASTRO\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA, CLAIMING THAT SUCH A 
CRITICISM WOULD BE \"SUPERFICIAL.\"  FINALLY, BIELSA CLAIMED 
THAT KIRCHNER WOULD VISIT WASHINGTON ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT 
\"WITHIN 90 DAYS\" AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (1995) 
JOSE OCTAVIO BORDON WAS NAMED THE NEW ARGENTINE AMBASSADOR TO 
THE UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  NESTOR KIRCHNER\'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS ON SUNDAY, MAY 
25 WAS CONSISTENT WITH MANY OF THE THEMES OUTLINED DURING HIS 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN (REF A) AND PRODUCED NO SURPRISES.  THE 
MODERATE TONE OF THE ADDRESS WAS FAIRLY WELL-RECEIVED ACROSS 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HERE, WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING THOSE 
POLITICAL FORCES LOYAL TO DEFEATED RIVAL CANDIDATES CARLOS 
MENEM AND ADOLFO RODRIGUEZ SAA.  ONE OF KIRCHNER\'S MOST 
FREQUENT THEMES WAS HIS CALL FOR A \"SERIOUS\" ADMINISTRATION, 
ONE CHARACTERIZED MORE BY \"DAY-TO-DAY WORK\" RATHER THAN 
\"GRANDIOSE\" ANNOUNCEMENTS OR PLANS.  A FEW POINTS FROM THE 
SPEECH FOLLOW. 
 
3.  (U)  GREATER ROLE FOR THE STATE IN THE ECONOMY.  KIRCHNER 
DEFENDED HIS CALL FOR A \"NATIONAL CAPITALISM\" (I.E., STRONGER 
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, PROTECTING VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF 
SOCIETY, INCREASED PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS 
AS MEANS OF EMPLOYMENT), AS OPPOSED TO \"THE MODEL OF 
PERMANENT SPENDING CUTS,\" SAYING, \"IT IS ENOUGH TO SEE HOW 
THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES PROTECT THEIR PRODUCERS, THEIR 
INDUSTRIES, AND THEIR WORKERS.\"  PREDICTING THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT\'S EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS WOULD PROVE 
WRONG \"NEOLIBERAL\" CREEDS CRITICAL OF UNPRODUCTIVE PUBLIC 
SPENDING, HE ASSERTED, \"WE ARE NOT INVENTING ANYTHING NEW; 
THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1930S OVERCAME THE DEEPEST ECONOMIC 
CRISIS OF THE CENTURY IN THAT WAY.\" 
 
4.  (U)  FISCAL BALANCE KEY.  DESPITE THE EMPHASIS ON 
KEYNESIAN-TYPE GOVERNMENT SPENDING, HE EMPHASIZED THAT 
MAINTAINING BALANCE IN THE PUBLIC-SECTOR FISCAL ACCOUNTS -- 
BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEVELS -- WOULD BE 
\"FUNDAMENTAL.\"  HE CONTINUED, \"THE COUNTRY CANNOT CONTINUE 
COVERING DEFICITS WITH PERMANENT INDEBTEDNESS NOR WITH 
UNCONTROLLED MONEY CREATION.\"  ON THE REVENUE SIDE, HE 
REITERATED CALLS FOR A MORE PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM, LOWER TAX 
RATES AS COLLECTION IMPROVED, AND STRONGER PROSECUTION OF TAX 
EVASION.  HE ALSO PLEDGED TO PURSUE A NEW PROVINCIAL 
REVENUE-SHARING ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD NOT ONLY IMPLY \"NEW 
DISTRIBUTION AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES\" BUT A \"NEW MODEL OF 
THE COUNTRY\" AS WELL. 
 
5.  (U)  FOREIGN POLICY:  FIRST, LATIN AMERICA.  HE 
REITERATED HIS WELL-WORN THEME THAT ARGENTINA\'S TOP FOREIGN 
POLICY PRIORITY WOULD BE STRENGTHENING TIES WITH LATIN 
AMERICA, BEGINNING WITH MERCOSUR.  DISCARDING ANY TYPE OF 
\"AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT\" WITH THE UNITED STATES, HE STRESSED HIS 
DESIRE FOR \"A SERIOUS, BROAD, AND MATURE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.\"  HE ALSO PLEDGED 
THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD COOPERATE FULLY IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
FIRST STEP:  MASS DISMISSALS IN THE MILITARY 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  IN CONTRAST TO THE MODERATE IMAGE PRESENTED IN THE 
INAUGURAL SPEECH, THE KIRCHNER TEAM SURPRISED ALL OBSERVERS 
HERE BY ANNOUNCING OVER THE INAUGURAL WEEKEND A MASSIVE 
OVERHAUL OF THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP.  KIRCHNER\'S DESIRE TO 
PUT GEN. ROBERTO BENDINI, COMMANDER OF THE XI MECHANIZED 
DIVISION IN RIO GALLEGOS, SANTA CRUZ PROVINCE (WHERE KIRCHNER 
SERVED AS GOVERNOR FOR MORE THAN A DECADE), IN CHARGE OF THE 
ARMY APPEARS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE SHAKEUP.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER JOSE PAMPURO, FOR HIS PART, PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT KIRCHNER WANTED A CLOSE CONFIDANT AS ARMY CHIEF.  GIVEN 
THAT BENDINI WAS 28TH ON THE ARMY LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION LIST, 
HIS REPLACEMENT OF CURRENT ARMY HEAD RICARDO BRINZONI WOULD 
HAVE MEANT, ACCORDING TO A STRICT INTERPRETATION OF MILITARY 
PROMOTION NORMS, THE RETIREMENT OF 27 ARMY GENERALS (75 
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).  PRESS REPORTS, HOWEVER, INDICATE THAT 
BENDINI -- WHO WILL FORMALLY TAKE OVER THE ARMY LEADERSHIP 
TODAY, MAY 28 --  WILL ASK EIGHT ARMY GENERALS FORMERLY AHEAD 
OF HIM ON THE PROMOTION LIST TO REMAIN IN THE SERVICE, WHICH 
WOULD MEAN THAT \"ONLY\" 19 ARMY GENERALS WOULD BE RETIRED.  AT 
THIS POINT, IT IS UNKNOWN IF KIRCHNER WILL ACCEPT THIS 
PROPOSAL. 
 
7.  (U)  THE OTHER SERVICES FACE SIMILAR RETIREMENTS BASED ON 
KIRCHNER\'S SELECTION OF JUNIOR FLAG OFFICERS TO BECOME 
SERVICE CHIEFS (E.G., 13 NAVY ADMIRALS, OR 50 PERCENT OF THE 
TOTAL, AND 12 AIR FORCE GENERALS, ALSO 50 PERCENT OF THE 
TOTAL, WILL APPARENTLY BE FORCED INTO RETIREMENT.)  ALL OF 
THOSE RETIRING WILL BE REPLACED BY THOSE WITH PAST TIES TO 
THE PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ AND KIRCHNER.  ON MAY 30, JORGE 
ALBERTO CHEVALLIER WILL TAKE OVER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT 
CHIEFS, A POST CURRENTLY HELD BY JUAN CARLOS MUGNOLO.  ON 
JUNE 4, CARLOS ROHDE WILL TAKE CHARGE OF THE AIR FORCE, 
REPLACING WALTER BARBERO.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, JORGE GODOY 
WILL REPLACE JOAQUIN STELLA AS THE HEAD OF THE NAVY. 
 
8. (C)  LOCAL MILITARY EXPERT ROSENDO FRAGA SUMMARIZED THE 
WIDESPREAD SENTIMENT OVER THE UNEXPECTED MOVES, ACKNOWLEDGING 
THAT KIRCHNER HAD THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE 
CHANGES, BUT ARGUING THAT THE PURGE DID NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE 
FOR A NEW PRESIDENT TRYING TO ENSURE INSTITUTIONAL 
CONTINUITY.  IN GENERAL BRINZONI\'S PARTING ADDRESS TO THE 
ARMY ON MAY 28, HE AFFIRMED THE ARMY\'S COMMITMENT TO 
UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND ARGENTINE LAW, BUT ADMITTED, 
\"THIS DISMISSAL HURTS, NOT FOR PERSONAL REASONS, BUT RATHER, 
FOR THE UNEXPLAINED CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT.\"  THE MOST 
IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE NEW APPOINTMENTS APPEARS TO BE 
KIRCHNER\'S DESIRE TO HAVE PEOPLE HE KNOWS WELL AND TRUSTS IN 
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ARMED SERVICES.  OTHER SPECULATION IS 
THAT HE AND SOME OF HIS MORE LEFTIST LEANING ALLIES IN THE 
NEW GOVERNMENT ARE USING THIS MASS DISMISSAL TO REMOVE ALL OF 
THE MOST SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WHO POTENTIALLY HAVE ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1976-83 \"PROCESO\" PERIOD OF MILITARY 
DICTATORSHIP.  (COMMENT:  LEFT-LEANING HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS HAVE 
OFTEN ACCUSED MEMBERS OF THE SENIOR MILITARY LEADERSHIP OF 
HAVING PLAYED ACTIVE ROLES IN \"EL PROCESO\" BUT WHEN PRESSED 
TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR 
ALLEGATIONS.  IN ADDITION, ALL MILITARY PROMOTION LISTS ARE 
SUBJECT TO STRICT CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY, WHICH PRESUMABLY 
WOULD HAVE EXPOSED ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING.  END 
COMMENT). 
 
------------------------------- 
NEXT TARGET:  THE SUPREME COURT 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\'S ZEAL FOR CHANGE DOES NOT 
END WITH THE ARMED FORCES, BUT APPARENTLY INCLUDES THE 
SUPREME COURT AS WELL.  KIRCHNER\'S NEW MINISTER OF JUSTICE, 
GUSTAVO BELIZ, SAID ON HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE THAT THE 
SUPREME COURT SHOULD NOT ESCAPE \"THE NECESSARY RENOVATION OF 
ALL THE POWERS OF THE STATE.\"  HE WAS QUICK TO ADD THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD STRICTLY ADHERE TO CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROCEDURES IN THIS AREA.  (OF COURSE, THE CONSTITUTIONALITY 
OF IMPEACHING THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN THE 
CENTRAL QUESTION OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT RATHER, THE 
ADVISABILITY OF SUCH AN EFFORT.)  THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME 
COURT FACED A DUHALDE-INSPIRED IMPEACHMENT VOTE IN THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES LAST YEAR, AN INSTITUTIONAL TIT-FOR-TAT 
THAT CAUSED THE COURT TO RULE ON REPEATED OCCASIONS AGAINST 
THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES.  IN THE FACE 
OF THOSE COURT DECISIONS, THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION 
ULTIMATELY BACKED DOWN, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE KIRCHNER TEAM 
IS NOW SIGNALING ITS WILLINGNESS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE COURT 
AGAIN.  IN FACT, AS NOTED IN REF B, KIRCHNER\'S NEW 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND CONFIDANT SERGIO ACEVEDO PRESIDED OVER 
THE IMPEACHMENT EFFORT AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT 
DURING THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION FROM HIS POST AS CHAIRMAN 
OF THE IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  OF 
THE NINE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, ONLY CHIEF JUSTICE 
NAZARENO AND THE DUHALDE-APPOINTED JUSTICE JUAN CARLOS 
MAQUEDA ATTENDED KIRCHNER\'S INAUGURATION CEREMONY, A CLEAR 
SIGN OF DISAPPROVAL BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT. 
 
10.  (U)  THE FIRST TARGET REPORTEDLY WILL BE JUSTICE CARLOS 
FAYT, WHO DID NOT RECUSE HIMSELF FROM PARTICIPATING IN A 2002 
COURT DECISION THAT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE GOA\'S 
\"CORRALITO\" BANK DEPOSIT RESTRICTIONS, DESPITE HOLDING A USD 
200,000 DEPOSIT IN BANCO NACION THAT HE LATER EXCHANGED FOR 
BODEN BONDS.  THERE IS WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT THE LOWER 
HOUSE COULD SEEK FAYT\'S SUSPENSION AS EARLY AS THIS MONTH 
WHILE PURSUING THE IMPEACHMENT CASE AGAINST HIM, ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS SOME DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARY 
SUSPEND A JUDGE FACING IMPEACHMENT RESTS WITH THE SENATE OR 
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  IF THOSE DEPUTIES LOYAL TO THE 
KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION SUCCEED IN IMPEACHING FAYT, THEY 
ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD SEEK TO DO THE SAME WITH THE MEMBERS 
OF MENEM\'S SO-CALLED \"AUTOMATIC MAJORITY\":  JULIO NAZARENO, 
ANTONIO BOGGIANO, GUSTAVO LOPEZ, ADOLFO VAZQUEZ, AND EDUARDO 
MOLINE O\'CONNOR. 
 
---------------------- 
CASTRO GRABS HEADLINES 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (U)  THE VISIT OF FIDEL CASTRO TO ARGENTINA FOR THE MAY 
25 INAUGURATION CAPTURED WIDESPREAD MEDIA AND PUBLIC 
ATTENTION, WITH THE OVERWHELMING PUBLIC SENTIMENT CLEARLY 
FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO THE CUBAN LEADER.  CASTRO\'S VISIT 
COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED THOSE OF BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT LULA AND 
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CHAVEZ.  THE TRIP WAS CASTRO\'S THIRD 
VISIT TO ARGENTINA, FOLLOWING EARLIER TRIPS IN 1959 (SHORTLY 
AFTER THE REVOLUTION) AND 1995 (DURING THE MENEM 
ADMINISTRATION TO ATTEND THE IBERO-AMERICAN SUMMIT IN 
BARILOCHE).  NEWSPAPERS CARRIED PHOTOS OF A BEAMING KIRCHNER 
LAUGHING AND CONVERSING WITH CASTRO AND THE TWO HAD THE 
LONGEST OF THE FORMER\'S MEETINGS WITH VISITING HEADS OF 
STATE.  ON MONDAY MAY 26, CASTRO DELIVERED A TWO-HOUR-PLUS 
SPEECH ON THE OUTSIDE STEPS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES 
LAW FACULTY BEFORE 5,000 ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS.  AT ANOTHER 
EVENT THE SAME DAY, BUENOS AIRES CITY MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA 
PINNED A MEDAL ON CASTRO\'S CHEST AND DESCRIBED HIM AS \"ONE OF 
THE MOST RESPECTED MEN IN THE WORLD.\"  THE FOLLOWING DAY, A 
SPANISH DAILY PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
RAFAEL BIELSA, WHO SAID:  \"I DO NOT DARE TO SAY OPENLY THAT 
HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED IN CUBA.  I DO NOT HAVE THE 
MORAL AUTHORITY, NOR A POST WHICH WOULD ALLOW ME TO SAY 
SOMETHING SO SUPERFICIAL.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
GOA SAYS KIRCHNER-BUSH TO MEET IN 90 DAYS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U)  NEWSPAPER HEADLINES ON MAY 27 TRUMPETED GOVERNMENT 
DECLARATIONS THAT KIRCHNER WOULD VISIT WASHINGTON ON AN 
OFFICIAL VISIT WITHIN 90 DAYS, FOLLOWING PUBLIC CONFIRMATION 
BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT PRESIDENT BUSH, IN HIS MAY 23 
PHONE CONVERSATION WITH KIRCHNER, HAD INVITED THE NEW 
PRESIDENT TO VISIT WASHINGTON.  IN A CONFUSED STATEMENT ON 
MAY 26, FOREIGN MINISTER BIELSA, EXPLAINED THAT KIRCHNER WAS 
TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE \"ARGENTINA HAD TO DISCUSS 
ISSUES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT, SUCH AS IN THE DISPUTE 
RESOLUTION ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD BANK HAS, AND IN THE 
MULTILATERAL CREDIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY FUND.  THERE, THE VOICE OF THE UNITED STATES IS VERY 
IMPORTANT.\"  THESE GOA DECLARATIONS CAME ABOUT DESPITE THE 
FACT THAT A SPECIFIC TIMETABLE FOR A KIRCHNER VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON WAS NOT BROACHED IN SECRETARY MARTINEZ\'S OFFICIAL 
MEETINGS WITH KIRCHNER. 
 
13.  (U)  IN OTHER NEWS OF IMMEDIATE BILATERAL INTEREST, JOS 
OCTAVIO BORDN WAS TAPPED BY THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION AS 
ARGENTINA\'S NEW AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES.  THE 
APPOINTMENT OF THE WELL-RESPECTED BORDN -- THE 1995 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND LATER, FREPASO LEADER -- IS A 
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT BORDN DOES NOT 
HAVE A PARTICULARLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH KIRCHNER.  OTHER 
SIGNIFICANT APPOINTMENTS INCLUDE JUAN PABLO LOHLE AS THE NEW 
AMBASSADOR TO BRASILIA AND JORGE VAZQUEZ AS THE NEW 
AMBASSADOR TO THE OAS AND JORGE TAIANA AS THE NEW MFA UNDER 
SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS (REPLACING FERNANDO 
PETRELLA).

SUBJECT: WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR 2004 UPDATE 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INCIDENCE AND NATURE OF CHILD LABOR 
AND RELATED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
1.  In 2002, the Ministry of Labor estimated that 7.1 percent 
of children ages 5 to 14 were working in Argentina.  Such 
statistics have not been updated to reflect the severity and 
consequences of the 2001 economic crisis.  According to the 
Minister of Health, there are more children than adults 
living in poverty.  An estimated 75 percent of Argentine 
children come from poor homes.  Despite the lack of updated 
labor statistics, CONAETI estimated in June 2004 that up to 
1.5 million children, or 23% of the child population are 
child laborers.  The rate is believed to be higher in rural 
than urban areas. 
 
2.  The GOA has been a member of ILO-IPEC since 1996 and has 
two principle agencies that deal with child labor issues: 1) 
the National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labor 
(CONAETI) and 2) the National Council for Childhood, 
Adolescence, and Family (CONNAF).  CONAETI was established in 
August 2000 to evaluate and coordinate efforts to prevent and 
eradicate child labor. In 2002, CONAETI established a 
National Plan for the Prevention and Elimination of Child 
Labor.  Until May 2003, the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP) also provided support to the Argentine 
Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security and CONAETI 
for their efforts to eradicate child labor. 
 
3.  CONNAF, on the other hand, has begun conducting awareness 
raising activities on the rights of children and the sexual 
abuse of children, and in 2000-2001 provided training to 
government officials on issues such as commercial sexual 
exploitation of children.  Since that time, it has worked 
with local governments and NGOs to support a National Network 
of Children\'s Rights Offices, which coordinates services for 
and protects the rights of at-risk children.  CONNAF has also 
established a program to coordinate national efforts with 
regional MERCOSUR partners to address the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children.  Together with the Attorney 
General, the Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights, 
the National Council of Women, and UNICEF, CONNAF also 
developed an action plan for the elimination of child 
prostitution.   The GOA is involved in the planning and 
management of a 2-year ILO-IPEC project to combat child labor 
in rural areas and a 1-year ILO-IPEC project to eradicate 
child labor among street workers and garbage pickers in 
Buenos Aires, both initiated in 2002. 
 
---------------------------------- 
ILO-IPEC PROJECTS WITH GOVERNMENT 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  In September 2003, CONAETI began a national child labor 
survey with technical assistance from ILO-IPEC,s SIMPOC that 
will be completed December 2004. In April 2004, the GOA, the 
ILO, and the Sub-Secretariat of Technical Programming and 
Labor Studies of the Minister of Labor, Employment, and 
Social Security announced their plans to conduct another 
survey on child labor-related activities in Argentina.  The 
survey will encompass Buenos Aires, Mendoza, Jujuy, Salta, 
and Tucuman in the Northwest and Chaco and Formosa in the 
Northeast.  As a result of child labor increasing in urban 
environments, this is the first survey that involves the same 
number of urban and rural zones. 
 
5.  In addition, the GOA, along with ILO-IPEC, the other 
MERCOSUR governments, and the Government of Chile, developed 
a 2002-2004 regional plan to combat child labor by agreeing 
to develop a regional strategy, build capacity to prevent and 
eradicate child labor, and analyze and share information on 
the problem.  The plan includes a commission for child 
labor-related issues in addition to a regional graphic 
campaign with the ILO. 
 
6.  Graphic and information campaigns are key to the GOA\'s 
general plan to combat and prevent child labor.  In April and 
November 2003, IPEC approved the financing of graphic and 
information campaigns throughout the country.  Through 
advertising on radio, television, and in newspapers, the GOA 
hopes to raise public awareness of child labor.  CONAETI 
believes that the future of the fight against child labor is 
public involvement.  In May 2004, the Carlos Carella Theater 
in Buenos Aires held a performance to inform the public about 
the causes and consequences of child labor followed by a 
forum conducted by government officials. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
URBAN INCIDENCE OF CHILD LABOR AND THE NATIONAL PROGRAM TO 
COMBAT AND PREVENT IT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
7.  Child labor in urban zones is a recent phenomenon dating 
back to the 1990s that has increased following the 2001 
economic crisis.  Children work in urban sectors such as 
trash recycling, street sales, begging, shoe shining, 
domestic labor, in small and medium businesses, small-scale 
garment production, food preparation, and brickwork.  Street 
laborers, or  cartoneros, are most visible.  In March 2004, 
the ex-Minister of Labor accused the courts of legalizing the 
labor (prohibited by Law 20.744) of 1,700 Buenos Aires 
adolescent cartoneros.  Her investigation revealed that these 
children worked nights collecting trash on the streets 
instead of attending school.  The number of cartoneros has 
increased since the 2001 meltdown with 8,153 people working 
in Buenos Aires, 16.9 percent being under 18 years of age. 
Before the economic crisis, there was an estimated 1,600 
children working the streets of Buenos Aires.  In 2004, the 
Council of Child and Adolescent Rights studied five sectors 
of Buenos Aires and found there to be 1,350 children working 
on the streets.  This number extrapolated to include the 
entire city is approximately 2,700 children.  This statistic 
does not reflect the children in Buenos Aires who are working 
in the domestic sector. 
 
8.  Domestic labor is another sector in which an increasing 
number of children have begun to work since the 2001 crisis. 
However, it is difficult to measure and regulate given that 
it takes place within the privacy of the home.  The GOA often 
has to rely on schools to report incidents of child 
exploitation as domestic labor because it is an invisible 
sector.  In 2004, 150 cases of child domestic labor have been 
reported by the Buenos Aires schools to the Council of Child 
and Adolescent Rights. 
 
9.  Children in Argentina are also involved in prostitution, 
pornography, sex tourism, and drug trafficking, but precise 
statistics are unavailable.  In early 2003, the GOA first 
became a participant in a two-year ILO-IPEC regional project 
to prevent and eliminate commercial sexual exploitation of 
children in the Tri-Border area.  This issue is particularly 
relevant in 2004 because it is the first year that Argentina 
was included in the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Luz 
de Infancia is one of the programs in the Tri-Border Area 
that focuses on combating and preventing child sexual 
exploitation. 
 
10.  CONAETI approved another project in 2003 to address 
child labor in urban areas.  The national urban plan is 
pursued through local projects and organizations that are 
financially supported by the GOA.  Although lacking a 
comprehensive prevention policy, the urban plan does consist 
of a network of information campaigns, outreach, and child 
victim identification in the city of Buenos Aires.  By 
offering such services ranging from health to education to 
recreation, Buenos Aires aims to provide its youth with a 
social welfare system that will increase their civic 
awareness and participation, thereby protecting them from 
exploitation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
RURAL INCIDENCE OF CHILD LABOR AND THE NATIONAL PROGRAM 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
11.  Child labor has traditionally been more prevalent in 
rural zones, where children perform agriculture-related labor 
concerned with tea, tobacco, tomatoes, strawberries, and 
flowers.  The national rural program consists of three 
stages: 1) providing compensation and training to parents to 
increase their economic levels so that they can take their 
children out of the labor sector and ensure their long-term 
enrollment and attendance in school; 2) a social dialogue 
table as part of the commission of the province of Misiones 
for various organizations, companies, and public officials; 
and 3) an ILO-approved child labor investigation in San 
Vicente in Misiones.  A coordination unit evaluates the 
progress and continuity of the rural program. 
 
12.  Provincial governments are also working to combat child 
labor primarily through cooperation with UNICEF to raise 
awareness of the importance of education and promote family 
and community involvement in educational design; and provide 
alternative income opportunities for families of child 
laborers so they can attend school.  The Inter-American 
Development Bank provided a loan to the GOA in 2001 aimed at 
supporting the provinces in improving the quality, equity and 
efficiency of the education system, thereby promoting 
increased future employment opportunities for young people 
from poor families.  The GOA has also received funding from 
the World Bank to reform the third cycle of basic education 
(grades seven to nine) in Buenos Aires Province. 
 
13.  In April 2004, an agreement to create specialized 
commissions in each province was signed by the Ministry of 
Labor, the National Commission for the Eradication of Child 
Labor, the Federal Council of Labor, as well as by the 
provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, Corrientes, Misiones, 
Tucuman, Jujuy, Catamarca, La Rioja, Mendoza, Rio Negro, 
Pampa, and Salta.  Eleven provinces did not sign the 
agreement: Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero, Cordoba, 
Santa Fe, San Luis, San Juan, Neuquen, Chubut, Santa Cruz, 
and Tierra del Fuego.  Concerns have been raised over the 
efficacy of the provincial commissions since the degree of 
child labor and resources to combat it vary from one province 
to the next.  In June, CONAETI and MERCOSUR announced a joint 
campaign with the provincial commissions to combat child 
labor. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
EDUCATIONAL ISSUES: CONSEQUENCES OF CHILD LABOR 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
14.  Education is free and compulsory in Argentina for 10 
years, beginning at age 5.  In 2000, the gross primary 
enrollment rate was 120.1 percent, and the net primary 
enrollment rate was 107.5 percent.  According to a government 
survey in 2001, 99.1 percent of children ages 6 to 12 
attended school, and 97.2 percent of children ages 13 to 14 
attended school.  In 1999, 90.3 percent of children who 
enrolled in primary school in Argentina reached grade five 
suggesting that continuing enrollment is most relevant to the 
issue of child labor.  Therefore, some serious educational 
problems persist. 
 
15.  Access to schooling is limited in some rural areas of 
the country.  Enrollment has become a greater issue in both 
the urban and rural areas since the 2001 economic crisis as 
children have dropped out of school to work and help support 
their families.  In particular, poverty and school desertion 
have been prevalent in the indigenous communities.  In July, 
the Education Ministry announced the establishment of a 
bilingual program in at least 1,000 of the 2,500 schools 
throughout the country that have indigenous students.  This 
program is to prevent the desertion of students belonging to 
the Wichi, Mapuche, Toba, Mocovi, Kolla, Guarani, and Pilaga 
communities.  The program will also include scholarships to 
be distributed to 5,000 indigenes. 
 
16.  The social inclusion of children is also needed 
throughout the remainder of the country to protect them from 
exploitation.  One out of every five adolescents from the 
Buenos Aires province between the ages of 14 and 21 does not 
go to school, and one million live below the poverty line, 
according to the Ministry of Human Development.  Up to 12,000 
do not know how to read or write.  The Ministry emphasizes 
that it is the responsibility of the state to advance the 
social inclusion of these adolescents through educational 
programs in the provinces. 
 
17.  Therefore, in May 2004, the Ministry of Human 
Development announced a program that will give out 20,000 
scholarships to such adolescents.  Proyecto Adolescentes will 
distribute 20,000 scholarships of 150 pesos per month for one 
year to send these adolescents to school.  In July, President 
Kirchner announced a new program directed at the one million 
18-25 year old Argentines who neither work nor study and are 
considered the most vulnerable and most critical socially 
marginalized group.  This program, administered through the 
Ministry of Social Development, will provide the young adults 
with six-month job placements or scholarships of 100 pesos 
per month.  The IDB is providing 30 million pesos in 
financial support of this initiative. 
 
-------------------------------- 
CHILD LABOR LAWS AND ENFORCEMENT 
-------------------------------- 
 
18.  The Law on Labor Contracts (No. 20.744) sets the minimum 
age for employment at 14 years.  Children of legal working 
age, however, are prohibited from entering employment if they 
have not completed compulsory education, which normally ends 
at age 15.  Children who are under the age of 14 may work 
only in businesses where family members are employed, as long 
as the work is not dangerous to them.  Children ages 14 to 18 
are prohibited from working more than 6 hours a day and 36 
hours a week and must present medical certificates that 
attest to their ability to perform such work.  If permission 
is obtained from administrative authorities, however, 
children ages 16 to 18 may work 8 hours a day and 48 hours a 
week.  Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from 
working between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. and from 
engaging in work that could endanger their safety, health or 
moral integrity. 
 
19.  Slavery and the facilitation of the prostitution of 
children, trafficking of children into or out of Argentina 
for prostitution, and pornography are also prohibited.  As 
previously mentioned, the sexual exploitation of minors 
persists. One example is a case of prostitution in the city 
of Buenos Aires. 
 
20.  Two women were arrested in the Buenos Aires neighborhood 
of Caballito in June 2004 for prostituting a fifteen-year old 
girl who suffered from tuberculosis as a result of 
malnutrition and exploitation.  The women would often offer 
food, shelter, and work to young girls without family or who 
just arrived from the country\'s interior.  After initially 
being offered employment as domestics in Buenos Aires 
households, the girls were forced into prostitution.  The 
women are currently awaiting trial in Buenos Aires in 
violation of the Law of Profilaxis Venerea and for the 
corruption of minors. 
 
21.  Other forms of child labor are dealt with by the 
Ministry of Labor, which has authority over employers and 
imposes sanctions on the abusers on a case-by-case basis.  In 
January 2000, the GOA enacted a federal law that establishes 
a unified regime of sanctions for the infringement of labor 
laws, but child labor laws are still enforced on a provincial 
or local basis.  Violators of underage employment laws can 
receive a fine of USD 278 to USD 1,388 for each child 
employed.  UNICEF has charged that the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children occurs due to police inefficiency 
and the failure of the judiciary to intervene.  The 
Government of Argentina ratified ILO Convention 138 on 
November 11, 1996 and ILO Convention 182 on February 5, 2001. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CONCLUSION: A QUESTION OF EFFICACY 
---------------------------------- 
 
22.  While the government has made many recent efforts to 
eradicate and prevent child labor, Congress admitted in 2004 
that there are not sufficient inspectors or programs 
established to detect child exploitation.  It also noted the 
lack of sanctions against companies that use children to save 
money since they receive lower wages.  Furthermore, the 
Inspection Monitoring Unit, in charge of finding and 
responding to incidents of child labor, does not have the 
rescue support needed to aid exploited children.  The 
government, the ILO, and labor specialists admitted in 2004 
that one of the principal obstacles to combating and 
preventing child labor is the cultural perspective upheld in 
Argentina.  Many people believe that child labor is not 
harmful to the health and development of the child.  That is 
why CONAETI reiterates the need of public awareness and 
involvement in the future campaign against child labor.

VENEZUELA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Former President Eduardo Duhalde claims 
that a MERCOSUR-led \"South American Union\" will be announced 
before year\'s end.  He claimed to support free trade and 
FTAA, especially after the recent compromise reached at the 
WTO meeting in Geneva.  Duhalde said President Kirchner is 
more pragmatic than ideological, and said that he wanted to 
help him.  Duhalde discounted any challenge by President 
Kirchner or First Lady Cristina Kirchner to his control of 
Buenos Aires Province.  On Venezuela, he said that a 
democratic solution was the only way out of the current 
conflict, though he expressed the opinion that a Chavez 
victory would be better on the whole for Argentina.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Former President of Argentina and President of the 
MERCOSUR Commission Eduardo Duhalde (protect) came over for 
coffee at the Residence August 9.  Duhalde arrived ten 
minutes early, and said, \"Unlike others (read President 
Kirchner) I am always punctual.\" 
 
Still Bitter 
------------ 
 
3. (C) It was clear that Duhalde still feels he was slighted 
by the USG during his term as president.  He said the United 
States \"disrespected us\" and that President Bush would not 
even call him on the phone.  When President Bush finally 
called Duhalde in Davos, by then Duhalde said he recommended 
that the President get in touch with his successor.  Duhalde 
claimed that the U.S. had not paid attention to Latin America 
under the Bush Administration.  I disagreed with Duhalde\'s 
assessment, reminding him of the situation the U.S. faced 
after September 11.  Despite Duhalde\'s hurt feelings, he 
opined that President Bush\'s reelection would be \"better for 
Argentina,\" since he has concluded that prospects for FTAA 
and free trade would be better under a Bush Administration. 
 
Toward a South American Union 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Duhalde said South America is moving inexorably 
toward a \"South American Union\" which will be announced by 
the end of the year.  The goal will be to create a bloc like 
the European Union in South America, though Duhalde 
acknowledged that an EU-like entity is still \"decades away.\" 
MERCOSUR will take the lead in forming this alliance. 
Duhalde sees no contradiction between a South American Union 
and FTAA.  Duhalde is also working with Argentina, Brazil and 
Paraguay to create a special fund to help Paraguay and 
Bolivia. 
 
FTAA 
---- 
 
5. (SBU) \"We want free trade, but on fair terms,\" Duhalde 
proclaimed.  The WTO agreement in Geneva provides an 
opportunity for the elimination of subsidies, though Duhalde 
does not believe it will be easy.  But in Duhalde\'s view, 
FTAA is a must if Latin America is ever going to sustain 
economic growth and no longer be the region with the most 
inequality on the planet. 
 
Relationship with Kirchner 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Regarding his reportedly rocky relationship with 
President Kirchner, \"I want to help him,\" Duhalde assured.  I 
repeated President Bush\'s statement that the United States 
wanted Argentina and President Kirchner to succeed.  Duhalde 
agreed that Kirchner had to finish his term for the good of 
Argentina and its democracy.  As to Kirchner\'s supposed 
leftist ideology, do not be fooled by Kirchner\'s rhetoric, 
cautioned Duhalde.  He is essentially a pragmatist.  \"Look at 
his cabinet,\" he said.  \"They are all centrist or 
center-right,\" and he specifically mentioned Minister of 
Defense Jose Pampuro, Minister of the Presidency Alberto 
Fernandez, Minister of the Interior Anibal Fernandez, 
Minister of Health Gines Garcia and Minister of the Economy 
Roberto Lavagna.  What about Minister of Planning Julio De 
Vido?  \"I don\'t know him well, but he\'s a classic Peronist.\" 
 
7. (C) In Duhalde\'s view, Kirchner has made a tactical 
mistake by placing himself on the center-left side of the 
political spectrum.  \"He\'s not going to get many more votes 
on the Left,\" while he could lose considerably on the Right. 
Duhalde criticized Kirchner\'s disorganization and lack of 
punctuality.  He hopes Kirchner will learn the longer he is 
in office.  Until then, Duhalde sees no other choice but to 
help Kirchner.  Will Kirchner challenge Duhalde\'s control of 
BA province by running First Lady Cristina Fernandez de 
Kirchner (who runs well in the polls) for a Senate seat, as 
the press has speculated?  Not in your life, according to 
Duhalde.  Kirchner simply cannot afford the embarrassment of 
his wife losing a provincial election, so this will not 
happen.  Duhalde expects an agreement with Kirchner on the 
selection of provincial candidates for next year\'s election. 
 
Venezuela 
--------- 
 
8. (C)  Duhalde confirmed he will leave on Thursday for 
Venezuela, where he will be an electoral observer at the 
August 15 referendum.  He is convinced that \"the only 
solution in Venezuela is a democratic one.\"  I agreed, and 
said that it was important that the referendum process be 
democratic and transparent.  Duhalde agreed.  That said, he 
believes from Argentina\'s perspective it would be better if 
Chavez won the referendum.  \"Otherwise, there will be 
anarchy.\"  \"Better to have stability in Venezuela than to 
have both Colombia and Venezuela in turmoil,\" he claimed. 
 
Other Countries 
--------------- 
 
9. (C) President Alvaro Uribe in Colombia is Duhalde\'s 
favorite president.  \"Colombia\'s problem is our problem. 
When I was Menem\'s vice-president, I visited then-President 
Barco and delivered two (anti-guerrilla) aircraft to him,\" he 
recounted.  Elsewhere the region is in turmoil, including 
Peru and Bolivia.  Duhalde is impressed by Bolivian President 
Mesa but not by President Toledo of Peru. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) Duhalde was tanned (unusual in the Southern 
Hemisphere winter) and in good spirits.  He still feels 
Argentina and the Hemisphere owe him for keeping Argentina 
stable after the 2001-2 crisis.  Although he has said 
publicly he wants to retire from politics, it is clear he 
remains heavily engaged in day-to-day political events here. 
Despite his bitterness about perceived slights and his 
occasional anti-FTAA public pronouncements, I found him eager 
to maintain contact to compare notes on occasion. 
 
11. (C) As the strong man of Buenos Aires province, which 
contains one third of the Argentine population, Duhalde 
remains the second-most powerful political figure here after 
the President.  His public standing in the polls is still 
highly negative, as he is blamed by many for causing 
President De la Rua\'s downfall (something he vehemently 
denies), for the corruption of the Buenos Aires Province 
government and police, and by some in the Left for the death 
of two piqueteros during a demonstration while he was 
president.  Yet President Kirchner may have concluded that it 
is easier to govern by striking a deal with Duhalde.  There 
have been indications of late that Duhalde and Kirchner may 
agree on a common list of candidates for the important 2005 
national and local elections.  Under any scenario, Eduardo 
Duhalde will remain a force to be reckoned with in Argentina 
for some time to come.

SUBJECT: INDIGENOUS RIGHTS SUPPLEMENT: RIGHTS TO LAND AND 
BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN SALTA PROVINCE 
 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. Argentina\'s Northwest province of Salta is undergoing a 
gradual economic transformation with prices for agricultural 
products, mining, oil up, and the tourism sector growing.  Life, 
however, for the region\'s rural poor and indigenous communities 
remains difficult, characterized by high unemployment, low school 
retention, poor social infrastructure and urban migration.  Lack 
of bilingual education and qualified teachers is a primary factor 
in low school retention among the indigenous communities, and the 
provincial government sale of traditionally indigenous lands has 
also been identified as a serious problem affecting these 
communities.  The GOA has announced a national bilingual 
education program and education officials and non-governmental 
organizations remain committed to trying to address these issues. 
Given the complexity of the problems and the limited resources 
available, it may be too little too late. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
 
------------------------------- 
THE SELLING OF INDIGENOUS LANDS 
------------------------------- 
 
2. Political Intern traveled to Salta Province on August 6-7 to 
investigate indigenous education and property rights issues.  She 
met with the Dean of the Universidad Nacional de Salta (UNSA) 
Stella Perez de Bianchi and professors of human rights and 
anthropology as well as the Secretary of Education Programming 
Professor Graciela Mohedas from the Education Ministry of Salta 
to discuss indigenous rights and the new bilingual program. 
 
3. The GOA\'s July announcement of its new, national bilingual 
program coincided with the annual publishing of the International 
Work Group of Indigenous Affairs report in Denmark, which 
criticized the GOA for not respecting indigenous rights to 
property.  On June 23, Salta Governor Juan Romero sold 16,227 
hectares of land in the Pizarro Reserve inhabited by 85 Wichis 
and 35 Creoles (people of European or mixed descent) to soy 
farmers.  The Dean of UNSA, Stella Perez de Bianchi, explained to 
the Argentine press that this land was part of the protected 
Chaco Forest.  The Chaco forest is known to be the only dry 
forest found at such a high altitude.  Due to deforestation, 
desertification is occurring at a rapid rate. 
 
4. Yet, the environmental implications are not the only concern, 
since the lands are being taken away from indigenous communities 
such as the Wichi who have held claim to them for centuries. 
Salta is traditionally considered one of the most environmental- 
friendly provinces in Argentina.  The provincial government of 
Salta has argued that the lands in question are of little 
resource value since they are in a state of environmental 
degradation.  Secretary of Education Programming Prof. Graciela 
Mohedas confirmed this view, stating her belief that the 
indigenous communities have overworked the lands.  Academics and 
international organizations share a different perspective. 
 
5. Academics and international organizations are the primary 
defenders of indigenous rights to land in Argentina.  For 
centuries, indigenes have lived off the lands and collected 
medicinal plants that are not found elsewhere.  In 1994, the GOA 
invited academics to investigate how to resolve the sales of 
inhabited lands.  UNSA provided a proposal, but the government 
has not acted on it.  This year, the National Institute of 
Indigenous Issues (INAI) decided to reconsider the UNSA proposal. 
In July, professors from UNSA and the University of Buenos Aires 
sent a letter to the government of Salta saying that the sale of 
the protected lands is not only an environmental issue, but also 
affects the lives of the inhabitants forced to leave their homes. 
Academics are working with organizations such as Greenpeace and 
Conicet, the National Council of Scientific and Technical 
Investigations, to evaluate the consequences of the sales for 
indigenous as well as Creole communities.  (Conicet has also 
expressed interest in contributing with the universities in 
strengthening the bilingual program). 
 
---------------------- 
A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE 
---------------------- 
 
6. Both Creoles and indigenous groups inhabit lands sold by the 
Salta government.  Creoles have tried to initiate negotiations 
with the government to little effect.  From the indigenous 
perspective, local leaders do not traditionally negotiate, but 
rely on the support and intervention of international 
organizations such as Greenpeace.  The cultural perspective is 
also rooted in collective rights; an entire indigenous community 
often claims the right to land.  The Creoles, in contrast, 
maintain their individual claims to land.  Therefore the sale of 
land among the Creoles and the indigenous communities are treated 
separately. Furthermore, the UNSA professors believe that the 
Wichi in Salta have virtually lost all claims to land. Social 
conflict between the indigenes and the government persists.  In 
July, The Buenos Aires Herald suggested that the new bilingual 
program was announced to perhaps alleviate some of this tension. 
 
--------------------------- 
BILINGUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM 
--------------------------- 
 
7. The GOA announced the national bilingual program to improve 
the education of indigenous students at the primary level who 
live in remote towns and villages and are isolated from daily 
Spanish-contact.  There are three kinds of public schools in 
Argentina: 1) schools with Creole students only; 2) schools with 
indigenous students only; 3) and schools with both Creole and 
indigenous students (mainly found in cities).  The goal of this 
program is to institute bilingual instruction in at least 1,000 
of the 2,500 indigenous schools and maintain the enrollment of 
the Wichi, Mapuche, Toba, Mocovi, Kolla, Guarani, and Pilaga 
students.  The program is in effect for the first through third 
grades because most children have learned Spanish on their own by 
seventh grade.  A bilingual program is already in effect in 107 
schools in the provinces of Chaco, Formosa, and Salta, reaching 
out to 20,000 indigenous students. 
 
8. The current bilingual program is limited by a lack of trained 
teachers.  Instead, a translator with little or no formal 
education is in the classroom while another teacher instructs in 
Spanish.  Scholarship and training programs will be provided for 
bilingual instructors to receive higher education and training 
and return to their native communities to teach. 
 
9. Complicating the issue is the fact that the indigenous 
languages are not written languages, making it difficult to teach 
young children who have not had daily contact with Spanish how to 
read and write (in both Spanish and their local languages). 
Universities are working with the indigenous communities to 
transform the indigenous languages into written languages. This, 
however, is a long-term process, while each year there is more 
indigenous migration to the cities resulting in an urbanization 
and hispanization of the indigenous culture. Nevertheless, the 
universities remain committed to the bilingual program. 
 
10.  The UNSA representatives said that one of the faults of the 
bilingual program is that it will be implemented on a province-by- 
province basis.  Although following national guidelines, each 
provincial Education Ministry will have different degrees of 
enforcement and success.  The indigenous communities, however, 
are not neatly divided on a provincial basis. The Wichi, for 
example, live throughout Northwest Argentina.  University experts 
are therefore concerned over the varying quality of education 
given by different provincial systems.  Therefore, universities 
are going to coordinate with the provincial ministries in 
attempts to maintain a national standard of education. 
 
11. Prof. Mohedas from the Salta Education Ministry assured the 
Pol Intern that the provincial ministries would maintain national 
standards.  She said that she believes the education program has 
improved in Salta since the 2000 Social Plan. Before 2000, many 
schools were llanchos, adobe structures of the lower class found 
in Salta that had no running water or electricity.  According to 
Mohedas, now the schools are made of good construction and 
include bathrooms and eating facilities.  She also emphasized the 
1995 law that made school mandatory up to ninth instead of 
seventh grade. 
 
12. Prof. Mohedas was adamant that the provincial schools have 
improved.  On August 7, the Pol Intern visited a school in the 
remote village of Alemania, Salta about 80 kilometers outside of 
Salta.  Once a railroad track stop, Alemania now has several 
buildings where about ten families live.  There is no electricity 
and no running water.  There is a school where thirty children of 
mixed Spanish-indigenous descent are sent to live there with the 
teacher for four days a week.  The living conditions are very 
grim and much still needs to be done. 
 
--------------------------- 
POVERTY: THE CENTRAL FACTOR 
--------------------------- 
 
13. In Salta, poverty is a key factor in both the selling of 
lands and the education program. In Oran, Salta, 80% of the 
population is unemployed. More and more indigenes choose to 
migrate to the cities in search of work and to escape the poverty 
of their remote rural villages.  Half of the indigenous 
population of Salta lives in urban areas. Up to ten percent of 
the national indigenous population is found in Buenos Aires. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
14. In Salta, indigenous communities and other rural poor are 
being displaced through the sale of their land without 
negotiations between these communities and the provincial 
government.  People are forced out of their ancestral lands into 
other lots or the cities.  The indigenous communities are at a 
particular disadvantage because their leaders, culturally, are 
reluctant to negotiate directly with the government.  Social 
inclusion of an isolated group of people involves communication 
from both sides.  Yet, when the Creoles, usually more vocal in 
protecting their rights, have tried to negotiate, the provincial 
government tends to ignore their attempts. 
 
15. Nevertheless, the GOA is making an effort to socially include 
the indigenous community through the bilingual program. The 
language issue is an interesting debate because with the 
urbanization of the indigenous community, the number of speakers 
of indigenous languages is decreasing, leading some to question 
the amount of long-term effort that should be put into 
transforming the languages into written form.  It is a 
controversial issue concerning the maintenance of culture and 
heritage versus modernization and development.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Less than two weeks after assuming office, 
Justice Minister Horacio Daniel Rosatti presented four 
domestic security initiatives to the Senate initially 
proposed by his predecessor Gustavo Beliz, indicating that 
the recent change in leadership at the Ministry will not 
affect the GOA\'s general security strategy.  Rosatti chose to 
put forward four of the less controversial elements of his 
predecessor\'s more sweeping security package, avoiding for 
the moment more problematic issues, such as lowering the 
minimum age for prosecution and judicial reforms opposed by 
members of the Federal Judiciary.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) On August 4, the new Justice and Security Minister, 
Horacio Daniel Rosatti, pushed forward in the Senate elements 
of the former Justice Minister Beliz\'s high profile security 
plan.  Security remains a hot button issue with voters, and 
President Kirchner and his new justice team will continue to 
push the agenda forward, however, in a more cautious manner 
than Rosatti\'s predecessor.  With the dismissal of Beliz, 
there was a great deal of speculation that the GOA would 
scrap all or a majority of the sweeping security reform 
program.  Beliz had presented the bill to Congress under 
pressure from anti-crime activists and mass protests led by 
Juan Carlos Blumberg, the father of a victim in a high 
profile kidnap/murder case that has galvanized the Argentine 
society on the issue of security. 
 
3. (C) Soon after taking office Rosatti intimated in the 
media that he would examine each part of the proposed 
legislation, causing a great deal of rumor regarding the 
possibility of a major shift in the GOA\'s security strategy. 
The following day the GOA held a press conference emphasizing 
that President Kirchner had changed Justice Ministers, but 
not his commitment or focus on the proposed security reforms. 
 The passing of four parts of the old security plan by the 
Senate sends a clear message that the GOA has not drastically 
changed its policy. 
 
4. (C) The security initiatives passed by the Senate allow 
changes in the legal code to:  authorize authorities to 
reduce sentences for all types of crimes for individuals who 
assist in investigations; increase the maximum sentence for 
embezzlement convictions from two to six years; provide 
prosecutors with increased flexibility to void minor or petty 
criminal cases without prosecution; and, to restrict parole 
for convicts where there is a fear the person may become a 
repeat offender.  As with other recent legislative 
initiatives, the Kirchner Administration brought the 
initiatives up for a vote in the Senate before presenting 
them in the more contentious Lower House.  The initiatives 
were among the more non-controversial items included in the 
old security package, and received wide support among both 
Peronist and Radical Senators.  Many other more contentious 
issues dealing with a wide range of issues including the 
lowering of the age for prosecution and limiting the power of 
federal judges remain on hold.   There is, as yet, no 
indication when the Administration plans to move these 
initiatives forward in the Lower House. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  Per reftel, Post views Kirchner\'s decision 
to replace Beliz as not related to the former Minister\'s 
vision or work in the area of security reform, but as a 
result of a growing personality conflict between the two 
individuals.  In choosing to pursue the initiatives 
individually, as opposed to as a part of a giant security 
reform package, Rosatti has changed the tactics but not the 
direction of the Ministry.  It is unclear when or if Rossatti 
will pursue the more contentious provisions of the Beliz plan 
such as those dealing with limiting the authority of Federal 
Prosecutors and Judges.  Post does not believe the change in 
personnel will greatly alter the GOA\'s domestic security 
objectives, or post\'s ability to work effectively with the 
Justice Ministry.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) SUMMARY: On August 20 President Nestor Kirchner 
announced the transfer of the Security Secretariat from the 
Justice Ministry to the Interior Ministry.  This is widely 
viewed as a positive step that will increase the profile of 
security issues, by both placing one of the most influential 
Ministers in charge of the portfolio and locating the 
Secretariat\'s offices in the same building as the President. 
 
SIPDIS 
It is also an indication that the President is anxious to 
halt his falling poll numbers by taking a more active role in 
the management of security issues.  The move comes days in 
front of what promises to be the biggest anti-crime protest 
to date by anti-crime crusader Juan Carlos Blumberg, and is 
just one of several recent GOA initiatives designed to 
demonstrate the Government\'s work to improve the security 
situation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 2. (C) On August 20 President Nestor Kirchner announced the 
transfer of the Security Secretariat from the Justice 
Ministry to the Interior Ministry.  Newly-appointed Security 
Secretary Alberto Iribarne (reftel A) and his entire staff 
 
SIPDIS 
have been bureaucratically moved from the Justice Ministry to 
the Interior Ministry, and will be physically relocated to 
the Casa Rosada.  The move illustrates the increasing 
importance of security concerns in Argentina, and Kirchner\'s 
attempts to indicate he is proactively addressing the 
problem.  As a result of the move Iribarne will report to 
Interior Minister Anibal Fernandez, one the most outspoken 
and influential members of the Kirchner Cabinet.  The move 
also locates Iribarne in the same building as the President, 
which is locally being seen as a sign that the President will 
now play a personal role in GOA security policies.  Buenos 
Aires Province Governor Felipe Sola reflected the view that 
the change would increase Presidential involvement in this 
contentious issue when he said: \"the security issue will be 
physically closer to the President.\"  (COMMENT: Not everyone 
agrees-- one local observer told Ambassador that moving the 
Security Secretariat to the Presidency increased the risk of 
further politicization of the Security Forces.  END COMMENT.) 
 
3. (C) In the days leading up to the transfer Fernandez 
seemed to go out of his way to pick a fight with both the 
moderate and the radical piquetero elements.  Other members 
of the Cabinet did not support his statements, but were also 
restrained in their criticism.  Since adding the security 
issue to his portfolio, Fernandez has remained quiet on the 
piquetero issue, but did spend his first weekend in charge of 
the nation\'s security \"personally supervising\" the work of 
the Gendarmeria (border guard) and the Prefectura (coast 
guard) working in the Buenos Aires area.  The Government 
announced the change while Justice and Security Minister 
Horacio Rosatti was out of town, and reports indicate he was 
not consulted prior to the announcement.  Rosatti has yet to 
comment publicly on the move. 
 
4. (C) On August 24 the Commander of Operations for the 
Gendarmeria, General Roberto Nieva Malaver, met with the DCM. 
 He expressed concern for the President\'s current security 
strategy but support for placing the Security Portfolio under 
Fernandez.  He informed the DCM that more then 1,000 of the 
total 17,000 strong Gendarmeria were currently serving in and 
around the Capital.  He stressed that they were filling an 
internal security role that his troops were neither trained 
nor equipped to accomplish, and expressed great concern that 
the diversion of his agency from its traditional border 
security function would lead to a general worsening of the 
border security and drug trafficking situation.  He lamented 
that the current administration is focused totally on 
security in the Buenos Aires area and stated that \"for 
Kirchner the national border is General Paz\" (a street that 
marks the end of the Buenos Aires suburbs.)  He reflected the 
commonly held view that the security problem has recently 
gotten much worse.  He intimated that the Administration\'s 
policy of purging the police and involving the Gendarmeria, 
instead of providing sufficient resources to establish a 
credible and clean police force, was a mistake.  He stressed 
that \"I do not argue for my force (Gendarmeria) but for my 
country, the problem of security is very serious, I have 
children and when they go out dancing I can\'t sleep.\" 
However, he also commented that he felt that transferring 
responsibility for security to the Interior Ministry was a 
positive move.  He stated that Fernandez \"is a fighter, and a 
very important person in the Government.\" 
 
5. (C) The Security Secretariat\'s move comes days before the 
third protest organized by anti-crime crusader Juan Carlos 
Blumberg (Reftel B).  Blumberg has focused most of his 
attention on the Buenos Aires provincial leadership, but he 
has also made petitions to the National Congress and demanded 
swifter action from the Federal Government.  The move also 
comes during a flurry of security-related activity by various 
government agencies attempting to demonstrate their 
pro-security efforts in advance of the August 26 Blumberg 
march.  Recent changes include: passing of a crime bill 
enabling Judges to order convicts to serve separate sentences 
non-consecutively up to a 50-year maximum jail term; the 
deployment of an 80-man elite provincial police unit that 
will act independently of existing provincial police forces 
in San Isidro, a provincial area known as the kidnapping 
capital of Argentine, to both combat crime and investigate 
police corruption; the start of a cooperative anti-crime push 
between federal and provincial agencies including the 
Gendarmeria, Prefectura, and provincial police in five 
provincial neighborhoods surrounding the Capital; the 
announcement of plans to summon the Federal Security Council 
to increase coordination; and, the appointment of Maria del 
Carmen Falbo as the new prosecutor-general for the Province 
of Buenos Aires. 
 
6. (C) Federal and Provincial leaders have all roundly 
downplayed the importance of Blumberg as a national figure as 
well as the importance of his grassroots social protest 
movement.  Buenos Aires Governor Sola recently attempted to 
minimize Blumberg\'s importance by stating that \"Kidnappers 
are not bothered by marches.\"  (COMMENT:  While it is 
probably true that marches have little impact on kidnappers, 
it is obvious that politicians including the President, the 
Buenos Aires Mayor and many members of congress do read the 
papers and are clearly bothered by marches and falling poll 
numbers.  Blumberg his anti-crime campaign, and the growing 
public discontent are fueling a slide in the Kirchner 
Administration\'s approval ratings.  Both the Federal and 
Provincial leaderships are keenly aware that the Greater 
Buenos Aires populace has become increasingly fixated by 
security issues, and are attempting to take concrete -- and 
publicized -- steps to improve the situation. END COMMENT.)

1.  (C)  SUMMARY: A three judge panel last night, citing the 
prosecution\'s failure to prove their guilt, acquitted all 22 
Argentine defendants charged in the 1994 AMIA Jewish 
Community Center terrorist bombing.  The panel faulted the 
original Judge Juan Jose Galeano and prosecutors and blamed 
them, former government officials during the Menem 
administration and a congressional commission at the time for 
essentially trying to find a scapegoat for the attack and 
building a case to find them guilty.  The judicial panel 
called for investigations into the the handling of the 
investigation and the actions of the original Judge Galeano 
and others.  The verdict was not unexpected and was met with 
resignation here, but also anger on the part of many in the 
jewish community, including victims\' family members and 
survivors who charged the government with mishandling the 
investigation and prosecution.  The court will release its 
final verdict on October 29, at which time the full details 
of the judgement will be known along with any possible 
grounds for appeals.  The verdicts issued last night do 
nothing to resolve the AMIA case, assign blame, or uncover 
the truth.  On the contrary, while the GOA and interested 
parties will likely continue to seek domestic redress, and 
possibly international justice in the UN or OAS, renewed and 
reinvigorated attention will certainly be focused on Judge 
Galeano and the Menem-era handling of the investigation and 
trial and the numerous allegations of cover-up and diversion 
of justice.  Nevertheless in the long term, attention from 
Jewish organizations, the victims\' families, and world 
attention will also focus on the Kirchner administration\'s 
efforts to achieve some measure of justice in this important 
terrorist case.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  Almost three years after beginning the trial, and 
ten years after the July 1994 terrorist bombing of the AMIA 
Jewish Community Center in downtown Buenos Aires, a 
three-judge panel on September 2 acquitted all 22 Argentine 
defendants -- including the four Buenos Aires provincial 
police and one civilian accused of providing the stolen 
vehicle used as the carbomb by the actual perpetrators of the 
attack.  The investigation and trial has been rife with 
irregularities and accusations of mishandling and political 
cover-up.  The original judge Juan Jose Galeano and two of 
the original prosecutors Eamon Mullen and Jose Barbaccia were 
recused from the trial (Refs A and B) as a result of an 
illegal USD400,000 payment to chop shop owner Carlos Telledin 
for his testimony against the provincial police officers. 
 
3.  (U)  With the recusal of Galeano last December, trial 
co-complainants, the Delegation of Jewish Associations (DAIA) 
and the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA), became 
concerned that the trial and investigation under new judge 
Rodolfo Canicoba Corral had begun to focus more on the 
irregularities of the case rather than the guilt of the 
accused. In the Court\'s findings last night, apart from 
acquitting the defendants, the three-judge panel also implied 
that certain government officials and the prosecution, under 
public pressure to find a guilty party, had \"walked away from 
the seach for truth\" and looked instead for a scapegoat.  The 
panel called for an investigation of Galeano, Mullen and 
Barbaccia, and also former Menem-era Interior Minister Carlos 
Corach and Security Chief Hugo Anzorreguy.  The panel also 
called for an investigation into the actions of a special 
bicameral congressional committee created to investigate the 
AMIA case.  Even DAIA\'s lead lawyer, Marta Nercellas, was 
referred by the panel to the Bar Association for 
investigation. 
 
4.  (C)  The detailed findings of the court will not be 
publicized until October 29, at which time options for appeal 
by the GOA and/or AMIA, DAIA, \"Family and Friends of AMIA 
Victims\" and \"Memoria Activa\" will become more clear.  In 
conversations prior to the September 2 verdict, Acting DAIA 
President Jorge Kirzenbaum and DAIA lawyer Nercellas told 
PolOff that they would be appealing the expected acquittal of 
the five principal defendants.  Following the verdicts, a 
number of representatives of the various Jewish groups and 
interested parties vowed to take the case to various 
international fora, e.g. the United Nations and Organization 
for American States.  The twist here is that they are just as 
likely to bring suit against the GOA as they are against the 
just-acquited defendants.  DAIA and AMIA are both under fire 
from their constituencies for being complicit in the 
mishandling of the case. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  While the acquittal decision had been 
expected for some time, the court\'s repudiation of Judge 
Galeano\'s investigation and initial trial, and its 
implication of a concerted effort on the part of Galeano, 
prosecutors, former GOA officials and others to find a 
scapegoat and assign blame, was the surprise.  The judges\' 
decision insures that the AMIA saga becomes even more twisted 
and difficult -- if not impossible -- to resolve.  Appeal 
options will not become clear until the court publishes its 
detailed findings on October 29.  The \"international option,\" 
apparently exhausted by the GOA (Reftel A), is being raised 
again by both the GOA and the co-complainants.  Some of the 
co-complainants, however, are not talking about bringing suit 
in international fora against the just-acquitted defendants 
(or the assumed Hizbollah/Iranian authors of the attack), but 
rather against the GOA and former officials for the 
mismanagement and alledged cover-up in the case, and the 
resulting denial of justice and violation of the victims\' 
human rights. 
 
6.  (C)  The Kirchner administration gave new life to the 
investigation and trial soon after assuming office when it 
released classified documents and instructed intelligence 
agency (SIDE) officials to testify in the case.  Kirchner 
administration officials also blamed President Menem and his 
senior officials, as well as Judge Galeano, for manipulating 
the case to suit its own narrow political ends.  Beginning 
with this verdict, the Kirchner administration will have to 
consider what next steps it will pursue -- not just in the 
investigations of the actions of Galeano and Menem officials 
-- but also in how it will 
attempt to achieve a measure of justice in this case.  The 
Jewish organizations, families of victims and public opinion 
will make sure of that.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR LINO GUTIERREZ FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Recused trial judge Juan Jose Galeano 
tendered his resignation September 13 to the President in the 
face of the ongoing investigation into the alleged 
irregularities committed in his investigation of the 1994 
terrorist bombing of the Jewish Community Center (AMIA). 
President Kirchner has apparently decided to take no action 
for the moment on the resignation, allowing the Council of 
Magistrates\' investigation of Galeano to continue.  In 
another interesting twist, Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio, who 
is also looking into the AMIA investigation irregularities, 
is now himself under the microscope as another federal court 
this week called into question his impartiality, asking the 
executive branch to report on Bonadio\'s political 
responsibilities/linkages to the former Menem administration 
and Carlos Corach in particular, the former Minister of 
Interior under Menem.  Corach confidant Mario Baizan (please 
protect), described to PolOff the recent three-judge panel 
decision (Ref. A) to acquit the 22 Argentine defendants (the 
\"local connection\") of all charges related to the 1994 
attack, and to investigate Galeano, Corach and others, as a 
political decision orchestrated by the Kirchner 
administration.  The Kirchner administration did send a clear 
message of support for the recent judicial decision when 
Justice Minister Rosatti paid a visit September 10 to the 
Council of Magistrates and praised the courage of the 
three-judge panel, particularly its call for an investigation 
into Galeano\'s and others\' actions.  Embassy has no 
indications that the court\'s September 2 acquittal and call 
for investigations was, in any way, influenced or 
orchestrated by the Kirchner Administration.  Undoubtedly, 
the Kirchner Administration sees any investigation or turn of 
events that could cast aspersions on Menem and his 
government\'s actions/inactions in the AMIA issue as a bonus. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  On September 13, Judge Juan Jose Galeano, the 
original judge in the investigation and trial of the 1994 
terrorist bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center, 
tendered his resignation to President Nestor Kirchner. 
Galeano\'s resignation would have terminated the ongoing 
investigation of the Council of Magistrates into his conduct 
of the investigation and trial.  It also would close off the 
opportunity for Galeano to defend his actions and, perhaps, 
to divulge possibly embarrassing information about any number 
of past and current political figures.  Interestingly, 
President Kirchner has decided to take no action on the 
resignation (he has neither accepted nor refused it) allowing 
the Council\'s investigation to move ahead. 
 
3.  (C)  In a meeting with PolOff September 15, Mario Baizan 
(please protect), a close confidant of former Menem Interior 
Minister Carlos Corach (who is implicated in the AMIA 
investigation irregularities), described the September 2 
acquittal and call for investigations of Galeano, Corach and 
others as a political attack aimed at placing the blame for 
the failed investigation on former Menem-era officials.  As 
support for his contention, Baizan said that the narrative of 
the three-judge panel in its September 2 verdict almost 
exactly mirrored the scenario laid out publicly some time ago 
by First Lady and Senator Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
(i.e. that the Menem administration had purposefully hindered 
the investigation, covered up several interesting 
international leads -- including to Syria -- and sought to 
find convenient local scapegoats).  Baizan, who is well 
positioned to comment on the history of the attack and 
subsequent investigation (he served as a liaison under Corach 
in the Interior Ministry with Argentine, Israeli and U.S. law 
enforcement and intelligence services), stated that this 
verdict, and what he sees as the Kirchner Administration\'s 
political manipulation of the investigation, will hinder 
eventual efforts to bring the authors of the crime to 
justice. 
 
4.  (C)  Baizan explained that the court\'s decision 
discredits all the evidence that Judge Galeano had uncovered 
in his investigation.  Baizan also alerted PolOff that Judge 
Claudio Bonadio, already looking into Galeano\'s investigation 
irregularities, was himself going to be investigated because 
of alleged conflicts of interests from his time working under 
Corach in the Interior Ministry\'s Legal and Technical 
Secretariat at the beginning of the Menem Administration. 
 
SIPDIS 
Removing Bonadio, Baizan said, would stall those 
investigations, further hindering an ultimate resolution of 
that aspect of the case.  (Note:  The day after PolOff\'s 
meeting with Baizan, the press reported that the First 
Federal Court had requested the administration provide a 
report on Bonadio\'s activities during the Menem 
Administration.) 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  The court\'s September 2 acquittal of the 
Argentine defendants, and its calls for an investigation into 
the original judge\'s and Menem-era officials\' actions, has 
muddied the waters and given renewed life to old and new 
conspiracy theories.  Kirchner is walking a fine line.  While 
Kirchner and the GOA have clearly shown they are anxious to 
move the AMIA investigation forward (e.g. by releasing 
classified documents and making intelligence personnel 
available for testimony), the opportunity to focus attention 
on the alleged mishandling/cover-up of the initial 
investigation by the Menem Government is irresistible. 
Fortunately for Kirchner, this aspect of the continuing AMIA 
saga has a life of its own and will require little 
encouragement from the government.  What will be more 
important for his administration in the long run is how the 
government now facilitates and promotes the efforts to 
identify and prosecute the still-at-large authors and agents 
of the terrorist attack.  The Jewish community and groups 
representing the victims\' families are pressuring the 
government to renew its efforts to try to bring the suspected 
Hizbollah and Iranian culprits to justice.  The three-judge 
panel that issued the September 2 acquittal ruling does not 
release its detailed ruling until October 29.  At that time, 
it will become clearer what sort of evidence exists against 
Galeano, Corach and others, and how much of the evidence and 
testimony collected by Galeano can be used in the continuing 
case.  Our discussions with Judge Galeano, former 
prosecutors, and SIDE, (the intelligence service), as well as 
a review of the AMIA indictment, indicate that the 
investigation was based mostly on circumstantial evidence 
that required further extensive corroboration and that the 
investigators failed to exhaust local and international 
leads.  We believe it is very unlikely that, 10 years later, 
whatever leads remain will yield useful evidence.

SUBJECT: ARGENTINA SIGNS INL LETTER OF AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 186187 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Foreign Minister Beilsa and Ambassador 
Gutierrez signed the first INL Letter of Agreement (LOA) 
since 1995.  Post would like to express its appreciation to 
the INL and L Bureaus for their tremendous assistance in this 
process.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) On September 17, Argentina\'s Foreign Minister Rafael 
Antonio Bielsa signed the first INL Letter of Agreement 
between the GOA and the United States since 1995.  The 
agreement marks the end of years of often highly contentious 
on-again-off-again negotiations between Post and the Foreign 
Ministry\'s Office of Legal Affairs.  For LOA text see reftel. 
 
3.  (SBU) Eight months ago Post decided to revisit the LOA 
issue with the GOA, and developed an integrated country team 
approach to constructively engage the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) on several levels.  Both the Ambassador and the 
DCM repeatedly extolled the potential benefits of an LOA with 
a wide range of high-level contacts, and Post included LOA 
talking points for visiting CODELS and high level visitors to 
use whenever the issue of GOA assistance was broached.  Pol, 
Econ, DEA and LEGATT representatives also routinely discussed 
the possible benefits of an LOA with their contacts, both 
within the Foreign Ministry and with interested host country 
entities such as the Justice Ministry, Gendarmeria, Aduanas, 
Federal Police, and SEDRANAR who stood to gain from an LOA 
agreement.  This multi-front, multi-level country team 
approach succeeded in keeping the pressure on the MFA, and 
more specifically on the MFA\'s Legal Section, to reach an 
agreement.  Combined with this mission-wide effort to keep 
the issue on the MFA\'s agenda, INL and L Bureaus both 
assisted greatly in keeping the LOA ball rolling by 
responding quickly to the GOA\'s questions and suggestions. 
The proactive and rapid response from INL, L and Post 
eliminated the MFA\'s favored method of deflecting pressure 
from other GOA entities, which was to claim that \"they were 
awaiting a response from the Embassy.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) Post believes the turning point in the negotiations 
was a Conference Call suggested by Post, and chaired by Tom 
Martin; with the participation of Patt Prugh from L, WHA Desk 
Officer Randy Fleitman, Embassy personnel and the head of the 
MFA Legal Section.  During this conversation many of the 
traditional Argentine objections were overcome, and a road 
map was established that eventually led to an agreement.

Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1. (C)  Summary: Poloff recently met with several of the 
leading Argentine pollsters to discuss their views on the 
image of the United States, public support for Kirchner, and 
the current political situation in Argentina.  Included in 
these meetings were Graciela Romer, Manuel Mora y Araujo, 
Marita Carballo, Enrique Puceiro, Hugo Haime, and Analia del 
Franco.  The polling experts ascribed the comparatively 
negative public opinion of the United States to past history 
and current policy disagreements, but argue the views are 
more a knee-jerk reaction than a deep-seated dislike of 
America and Americans.  Kirchner\'s approval ratings vary from 
pollster to pollster, but all agree he has lost a significant 
level of support over the past year.  They view the political 
situation as being in flux, with a divided opposition and a 
ruling Peronist Party (PJ) that has become more of a culture 
than a party.  Some pollsters see the traditional party 
system eventually being replaced by new center-left and 
center-right coalitions.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Public Opinion of United States Multifaceted 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  All of the pollsters attributed the poor image of the 
United States in Argentina to historical trends, a reaction 
to the policies of former President Carlos Menem, and 
disagreement with current US policy.  However, they feel 
these negative views do not translate into a rejection of US 
values or anger towards Americans.  They discussed at length 
with Poloff the reason the recent Latinbarometer poll found 
that only three in ten Argentines had a positive view of the 
United States, well below the regional average.  The 
pollsters pointed to Argentina\'s past trend of competing with 
the United States for regional leadership, the lack of 
knowledge of the U.S. in a country traditionally focused on 
relations with Europe, an association in the public\'s mind 
between the U.S. and the IMF\'s role in the 2001-2002 economic 
crisis, and a reaction to the \"carnal relations\" between the 
two countries associated with the now widely disliked Menem 
administration.  They argued that disagreements with current 
US policies in areas such as Iraq are also a source of 
negative feelings toward the United States, but are not as 
important as historical factors.  It is interesting to note 
that positive views of the U.S. only dropped eight points--38 
percent to 30 percent--between the 2002 Latinbarometer, 
completed before the Iraq war, and the 2003 Latinbarometer, 
taken after the war began.  However, the number of Argentines 
saying they had a good opinion of America dropped from 53 
percent just before the crisis in 2001 to 38 percent the 
following year, showing the impact of the economic crisis on 
the Argentine image of the U.S..  Marita Carballo of 
TNS-Gallup mentioned that throughout the economic crisis, her 
polls showed that Argentines blamed their own government 
primarily for the crisis, although the IMF and the U.S. were 
viewed as contributing agents. 
 
3.  (C)  When asked how to improve opinion of the U.S., all 
of the pollsters recommended an increase in exchanges, 
particularly at the non-governmental level, involving both 
countries\' academic, scientific, business, and cultural 
communities.  The opinion experts felt that increasing the 
frequency of these exchanges, and the publicity they 
generate, would help break down the wall of ignorance that 
exists about the United States and demonstrate the positive 
aspects of the bilateral relationship.  Graciela Romer 
recommended a program to teach the best practices from the US 
Congress to assist the Argentine Congress in its current 
efforts to be more transparent.  The pollsters generally 
complimented the Embassy\'s efforts to build a stronger 
relationship between the two countries and felt these efforts 
would be reflected in improved polling numbers for the U.S. 
over time. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Kirchner\'s Approval Rating Depends on the Question 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  (C)  President Nestor Kirchner\'s support level varies 
widely among the pollsters, depending on how they ask the 
question, but most have Kirchner\'s approval ratings between 
50 and 58 percent.  Kirchner tends to poll at least ten 
points higher on his personal image than on his performance 
as president.  Kirchner also does better when the question is 
asked as a two-option, approve or disapprove question, than 
he does if the question is asked with a more standard 
four-point or five-point scale.  For example, Puceiro\'s 
latest polling shows that 58 percent of Argentines think 
Kirchner is doing a good or very good job as president, with 
33 percent saying he is doing an average job.  However, when 
asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of Kirchner\'s 
job performance, without the option of a middle category, 78 
percent said they approved.  Graciela Romer had Kirchner\'s 
positive personal image at 55 percent, with 28 percent giving 
him an average personal rating.  For job performance, Romer\'s 
polling came in lower than the other pollsters, with 42 
percent saying Kirchner was doing a good job and 35 percent 
giving him an average rating.  Kirchner has higher ratings on 
his performance with the economy and foreign relations than 
he does with controlling crime and dealing with the 
piqueteros.  The pollsters lamented how their polls are 
frequently misquoted in the press, causing a great deal of 
confusion on Kirchner\'s actual approval rating.  Both Enrique 
Zuleta Puceiro and Analia del Franco vehemently denied the 
allegations made in the 21 August Noticias article that 
accused them of biasing their polling in favor of Kirchner. 
They argued the numbers used in the Noticias article were 
either wrong, or taken out of context.  (See Reftel) 
 
5.  (C)  The pollsters explained Kirchner\'s comparatively 
high approval rating as being a result of an improving 
economy, a favorable comparison with past presidents, a lack 
of viable alternatives, and the fact that he is seen as an 
individual seeking to change the system.  As Mora y Araujo 
put it, Kirchner is viewed by many as the man on the white 
horse in western movies that rides into town to take over for 
the corrupt and incompetent men that have been mismanaging 
things.  Kirchner\'s biggest challenges are the economy and 
crime and security issues.  Most of the polling experts were 
optimistic in the short term on the economy, although they 
generally attributed the economic improvements to a more 
favorable international situation than to Kirchner\'s decision 
making.  On crime and security, they felt the GOA lacked a 
clear strategy and was more focused on short-term strategies, 
rather than long-term needs, such as the complete overhaul of 
the Buenos Aires provincial police force.  Puceiro felt that 
Kirchner\'s support level would likely drop in the coming year 
because he would be forced to accept the PJ presidency in 
order to get the support from the PJ provincial party 
structure to make the gains he wants in the 2005 elections. 
By finally tying himself to the traditional Peronist 
structure, he will do permanent damage to his image as an 
outsider trying to clean up the system.  Most of the other 
pollsters agreed that Kirchner\'s approval ratings would 
continue to erode over the coming year, although they all 
felt there currently was no opposition leader on the horizon 
that could challenge Kirchner\'s top spot in the arena of 
public opinion.  Minister of the Economy Roberto Lavagna is 
the individual with the next highest approval rate, with 49 
percent of the population approving of the job he is doing in 
Puceiro\'s latest poll. 
 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Political System in Transition 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The pollsters described the political opposition as 
being in disarray, with some seeing an eventual end to the 
traditional party structure in Argentina.  All of the opinion 
analysts felt there currently is no well-organized political 
opposition outside of the PJ party.  Opposition figures like 
ARI leader Elisa Carrio, Recrear leader Ricardo Lopez Murphy, 
and Compromise for Change leader Mauricio Macri are merely 
figures without a national party structure, nor enough 
national appeal to directly challenge Kirchner.  The Radical 
Civil Union (UCR) party has a national party structure, but 
is too weak and divided to act as a real check on the GOA. 
Some pollsters, such as Graciela Romer, felt the PJ and UCR 
no longer represent the Argentine electorate.  For Romer, 
these traditional parties have become fractured, loose 
groupings that encompass individuals from mutually exclusive 
political points of view.  As Rosendo Fraga recently put it 
in a meeting with DCM and POLCOUNS, the PJ has become more of 
a culture than a political party.  The UCR has faced the 
brunt of these political changes over the past few years, as 
leading members of the party have left to form their own 
political organizations.  Romer felt the eventual fracturing 
of the PJ was also inevitable.  What she thought would 
replace the current political structure is a center-right and 
a center-left coalition.  (Comment:  Dr. Ruben Octavio 
Villan, who works with Mauricio Macri, recently gave Poloffs 
a similar prediction.  He felt what has happened in the 
Buenos Aires city politics, with leaders breaking off of the 
UCR and PJ to form their own political organizations, is a 
foreshadowing of what will eventually happen on a national 
stage.  It must be noted that none of our contacts, nor the 
Embassy, feel this scenario is likely to happen anytime in 
the near future.  End Comment)  The pollsters felt the main 
obstacles that impeded the formation of new opposition 
grouping are the egos of the opposition leaders, the negative 
association Argentines have with political alliances 
following the disastrous experience with former President de 
la Rua\'s coalition government, and Kirchner\'s high approval 
ratings.  Puceiro felt it was also impossible for leftist 
parties to develop because there was little political space 
between Kirchner and the piqueteros, who have high negatives 
among the public.

7.  (C)  Argentina has a well developed polling community, 
with several firms associated with major international 
research groups, such as TNS and Research International.  The 
pollsters are also excellent analysts of the Argentine 
political system and have proved to be an invaluable source 
of political reporting for the Embassy.  All of them are 
doing work for one or more political parties or figures, 
giving them access to interesting information on political 
strategy and negotiations.  We will continue to maintain 
close contact with them as we look toward the 2005 election.

Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (U)  Summary: The election of Adolfo Stubrin as president 
of the national Radical Civil Union (UCR) convention provides 
the UCR the opportunity to reorganize the party and begin to 
build on its grass-roots strength to serve as a viable 
opposition to the ruling Peronist Party (PJ).  Stubrin\'s 
first act has been to organize the opposition in the National 
Congress to oppose the GOA\'s attempts to grant special powers 
to Cabinet Chief, Alberto Fernandez.  Stubrin and UCR 
National Committee head, Angel Rozas, need to build up the 
party\'s provincial base, make alliances with other opposition 
groups, promote greater transparency in the party\'s internal 
decision-making, and heal the divisions within the party in 
order to revive the UCR to its traditional place as a strong 
political force in Argentina.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  On September 24, Adolfo Stubrin was elected to head 
the UCR convention, defeating former President Alfonsin\'s 
choice, Luis Caceres.  Stubrin\'s candidacy was backed by 
provincial elites and members of the National Committee that 
want a break with the old Alfonsin leadership and a more 
confrontational stance taken toward President Nestor 
Kirchner\'s administration.  The party is seeking to recover 
from the dismal two percent of the vote it received in the 
2003 presidential elections, following a December 2002 party 
primary that was tarnished with accusations of fraud.  The 
break with the old guard was by no means complete, as Rozas, 
who was a central figure in the 2002 primary disaster, 
remains in his position.  However, the election of Stubrin 
provided some badly needed new blood into the party 
leadership at a time when the party has been struggling to 
deal with the dominance of the PJ in national politics.  The 
UCR has the most Congressional seats of any party after the 
PJ, with 44 Deputies and 14 Senators.  The party retains 
significant strength in many of the provinces and is the only 
opposition party with a grass-roots party organization 
throughout the country.  The UCR also holds the governorships 
in Chaco, Catamarca, Rio Negro, and Mendoza and UCR candidate 
Gerardo Zamora leads in the polls for the February 2005 
gubernatorial election in Santiago del Estero.  Stubrin is 
seeking to build on this base to revitalize the party.  The 
movement to replace the Ley de Lemas system with primaries in 
key provinces, such as Santa Fe, also provides an opportunity 
for the UCR to make inroads into traditional PJ strongholds. 
(Note: The Ley de Lemas, still utilized in several provinces, 
allows parties to run multiple candidates in elections, with 
seats going to the party, rather than the candidate, who 
receives the most votes.  In practice, this system has been 
used by the PJ in provinces, like Santa Fe, to shut 
opposition parties out of power.  For example, in the 2003 
Santa Fe election for governor, Peronist Jorge Obeid was 
declared the winner, even though he only received 21 percent 
of the vote, while front-running Socialist candidate, Hermes 
Binner, received 36 percent of the vote.  Obeid was elected 
because the sum of the Peronists candidates totaled 43 
percent, while the sum of the Socialist candidates was only 
38 percent.) 
 
3.  (U)  Stubrin\'s first act as party congress head was to 
call for a unified opposition stand against the GOA\'s bid to 
give Cabinet Chief Fernandez powers, or \"superpoderes\", over 
the 2005 budget that are normally the exclusive right of the 
Congress.  This effort is made more complicated because the 
last time these powers were invoked it was at the behest of 
UCR President de la Rua\'s government for then Minister of the 
Economy, Domingo Cavallo.  Stubrin called for a meeting on 
Tuesday, October 12th of all opposition parties to organize a 
united front against the GOA\'s proposal.  The call was met by 
opposition from the Alfonsin camp within the UCR, showing how 
far the party needs to go in order to achieve unity. 
However, Stubrin\'s initial efforts to oppose the GOA\'s 
request for \"superpoderes\" have been received favorably by 
other opposition leaders outside of the UCR.  There is talk 
of an alliance between Recrear leader Ricardo Lopez Murphy 
and the UCR.  Affirmation for an Egalitarian Republic (ARI) 
leader Elisa Carrio says that she will not enter into an 
alliance with the UCR or any other party, although she 
supports Stubrin\'s efforts to oppose the granting of 
\"superpoderes\" to Fernandez. 
 
4.  (C)  Former UCR Deputy Jesus Rodriguez recently told 
Poloff that the UCR\'s two top goals should be the restoration 
of transparency in the internal decision-making of the party 
and the formation of solid alliances with other opposition 
groups.  Rodriguez worked tirelessly with other UCR members 
to ensure that Stubrin was elected and felt his election 
represented a new beginning for the party.  Leading pollster 
Manuel Mora y Araujo recently remarked to Poloff that the UCR 
needed to purge all of its top leadership in order to be able 
to move beyond the stigma of the failed de la Rua 
administration and the 2002 primary debacle.  (Comment: Some 
POL contacts continue to believe unproven allegations that 
Rozas was involved in vote rigging in the 2002 UCR primary, 
arguing that Rozas therefore needs to resign in order for the 
party to make a complete break with its troubled past.  When 
fraud charges were first raised in the press after the 
primary elections, Rozas appealed to the electoral council 
for new elections in the disputed provinces in order to clear 
his name.  When the request for new elections was denied, he 
resigned his leadership post in the party and only took it up 
again after new elections were completed in February 2003. 
See Reftels for more background.)  Dr. Ruben Octavio Villan, 
who works for Deputy Marcelo Rafael Godoy, both formerly of 
the UCR, reported to Poloff that he was not optimistic about 
the long-term prospects of the UCR\'s attempts at alliances. 
Villan argued that the opposition groups are competing for 
the same minority share of the votes and are plagued with 
leaders with sizable egos, who are not capable of sharing the 
limelight. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  The UCR is the only party with sufficient ground 
strength to organize a viable opposition to the PJ.  The 
election of Stubrin and his recent attempts to build a united 
opposition front against the Casa Rosada\'s \"superpoderes\" 
proposal is a good start toward that end.  The party 
continues to suffer from infighting between those aligned 
with Stubrin and Rozas and the Alfonsin wing of the party. 
Fortunately, the new party leadership has a year to work out 
the differences within the party in order to prepare for the 
next great challenge in the 2005 elections.  The UCR is 
Argentina\'s oldest political party and has recovered from 
several crushing blows in the past, such as the 1930 military 
overthrow of Radical President Hipolito Yrigoyen and 
Alfonsin\'s forced early departure from office in 1989, to 
subsequently regain the reigns of leadership in Argentina. 
The next year will determine whether the UCR can once again 
rise from the ashes, or remain a divided, minor party.

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE KIRCHNER VISIT TO CUBA STILL UNDER REVIEW 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 02682 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1. (C)  Summary: At a luncheon on October 6, Under Secretary 
for Foreign Policy Garcia Moritan told the Ambassador that 
Cuba was lobbying hard for an official visit from either 
President Nestor Kirchner or the first lady but that no visit 
would be contemplated until Cuban scientist Hilda Molina was 
allowed to visit her family in Argentina.  The Ambassador 
told Garcia Moritan a visit by Kirchner, regardless of the 
circumstances, was a bad idea and would simply play into the 
hands of the Cuban government.  We made it clear that we 
would prefer that no visit to Cuba by GoA officials take 
place.  However, if one did, the Ambassador stressed it was 
absolutely essential that Kirchner also meet with dissidents 
and opposition activists.  In a separate meeting the same day 
with the DCM, the Foreign Minister\'s Chief of Cabinet, 
Ambassador Eduardo Valdes, also raised the possibility of a 
Kirchner visit to Cuba.  The DCM underscored that a Kirchner 
visit would send the wrong message and undermine the strong 
commitment to human rights and democracy the president had 
demonstrated here in Argentina and in his dealings with other 
countries in the region.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  At a luncheon on October 6, the number three MFA 
official, Under Secretary for Foreign Policy Roberto Garcia 
Moritan, told the Ambassador that Cuba was lobbying hard for 
an official visit by either Kirchner or the first lady (and 
senator) Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.  Garcia Moritan 
noted that any consideration of a visit was dependent on 
resolving the long-standing issue of granting travel permits 
to Cuban scientist Hilda Molina and her mother to visit her 
son and his family in Argentina.  The Ambassador told Garcia 
Moritan a visit by Kirchner, regardless of the circumstances, 
was a bad idea and would simply play into the hands of the 
Cuban government.  However, if a visit did take place, he 
stressed to Garcia Moritan that it was absolutely essential 
that Kirchner also meet with dissidents and opposition 
activists. 
 
3. (C)  The same day the DCM, accompanied by the ECON and POL 
counselors, met with the Foreign Ministry Chief of Cabinet, 
Amb. Eduardo Valdes, to provide a briefing on a separate 
issue.  (MFA Director for North American Affairs Amb. Vicente 
Espeche Gil was also present.)  Following the briefing, 
Valdes quickly raised the issue of a possible Kirchner trip 
to Cuba.  He noted he was aware of the meeting DCM had with 
Under Secretary for Latin American Affairs Dario Alessandro 
last month on the Cuban visit issue. (reftel)  Valdes said 
the possibility of a Kirchner visit to Cuba had been 
misinterpreted and played up by the media.  As did Garcia 
Moritan with the Ambassador, he added that a presidential 
visit would not take place before a resolution of the Molina 
issue. 
 
4. (C)  Repeating the points delivered to Alessandro, the DCM 
emphasized that a Kirchner visit to Cuba (regardless of 
whether Molina was issued a travel permit) would send the 
wrong message in light of the systematic repression and 
crackdown by Cuba on opposition activists.  He pointed out 
that Kirchner had worked diligently to establish strong 
credentials as a supporter of human rights and constitutional 
democracy, noting his support for the constitutional 
government of President Mesa in Bolivia and for the recall 
referendum in Venezuela and that a Cuba visit would undermine 
these accomplishments.  The DCM told Valdes that if Kirchner 
ultimately did decide to visit Cuba, meetings with opposition 
and dissident figures would be critical.  Valdes responded 
with a replay of Kirchner\'s efforts in support of democratic 
institutions in Venezuela and Bolivia and then ended the 
meeting, stating that for the present \"we\'re not going\" (to 
Cuba). 
 
5. (C)  Comment:  The Ambassador and Country Team members 
will continue to raise the issue of human rights in Cuba  and 
to discourage GoA actions that can be manipulated by the 
Cuban government in Castro\'s favor.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: MEETING WITH TUCUMAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR AND 
LEADING JOURNALISTS 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary: On September 28-29, Pasoffs and Poloff 
met with Tucuman Governor Jose Jorge Alperovich and leading 
journalists in the province.  The meeting with the Governor 
was positive and covered key issues facing the province, such 
as economic reform, relations with the national government, 
and economic development.  The journalists Emboffs that met 
with provided a wealth of information about Tucuman politics 
and said they looked forward to future contacts with the 
Embassy.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Governor Alperovich was candid during his 
September 29 meeting with Emboffs, encouraging them to ask 
any type of question.  He covered issues ranging from 
economic reform, relations with the GOA, and the state of the 
economy in Tucuman.  The Governor stated that he thought the 
Fiscal Responsibility Law recently passed by the National 
Congress would have no trouble passing in Tucuman, although 
he felt the law would have little practical effect in the 
province, as Tucuman already had a strict financial 
responsibility law.  (Note: The Tucuman legislature passed 
the Fiscal Responsibility Law on October 1, becoming the 
second province in the country to approve the new law.)  He 
thought co-participation reform was not necessary and said it 
is not a priority for his administration.  He said he did not 
want to fight with Buenos Aires over an extra percentage 
point or two of co-participation funds, and would rather 
focus on more important issues for the province.  He 
described his relations with the national government as being 
good and that he was satisfied with the resources he received 
from the GOA.  He said that financial mismanagement by 
previous governors, and not a lack of funds from Buenos 
Aires, were the source of past funding problems for Tucuman. 
He admitted that although the province had many resources, 
especially in the agricultural sector, poverty was still a 
problem in Tucuman.  He emphasized however, that the province 
has enjoyed a much lower rate of unemployment over the past 
three years compared with the rest of the country.  The 
Governor also highlighted his efforts to bring in outside 
investment from the United States, China, and Chile, the 
development of a new railroad service, and the booming 
construction industry in the province.  Governor Alperovich 
closed the meeting by mentioning he planned to travel to 
Washington, DC this December. 
 
3.  (SBU)  BIO NOTE: Jose Alperovich was elected governor in 
October 2003, having served as a Peronist Party (PJ) Senator 
in the National Congress.  He originally was a member of the 
Radical Civil Union Party (UCR).  A son of Jewish, Lithuanian 
immigrants, Alperovich faced legal hurtles in his bid for 
governor, as the Tucuman Constitution required that all 
governors be Catholic.  A legal ruling in the province 
allowing non-Catholics to become governor cleared the way for 
his election.  Leading journalists described the governor\'s 
relationship with the Kirchner government as good on 
administrative matters, but much cooler on a personal level. 
Alperovich is tied to the Duhalde camp within the PJ, having 
a personal connection to Duhalde through his father and the 
father of Duhalde\'s former Central Bank head, Mario Blejer. 
Journalist German Valdez also reported that Kirchner was 
unhappy with the governor because he was met by 
protesters/piqueteros on his first trip to Tucuman as 
President in July that blocked his motorcade coming from the 
airport .  Valdez said Kirchner was also unhappy with the 
fact the province had two senators and three deputies from 
the family of ex-military governor and dirty war criminal, 
Antonio Bussi, as Kirchner was attempting to assert his 
authority over the military on a national level. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Emboffs met with leading journalists from the 
province, including Maximo Garcia Hamilton and Ricardo Le 
Fort from El Siglo, Carlos Abrehu and Jose Pochat from La 
Gaceta, and German Valdez from MC Radio & TV.  All of the 
journalists were pleased to meet with US Embassy officials 
and told Emboffs that they were looking forward to future 
close cooperation with Pasoffs.  La Gaceta is the oldest 
daily newspaper in the province, with the largest readership. 
 El Siglo formed as an offshoot of La Gaceta 14 years ago due 
to a conflict within the family that owns La Gaceta.  German 
Valdez is the leading radio and television journalist in 
Tucuman, who has been a good contact for many years for the 
Embassy.

Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  On October 13th, Ambassador accompanied by POLCOUNS 
and POLOFF met with leading Argentine pollster Graciela 
Romer.  She has long been a helpful contact of the Embassy. 
(SEE REFTEL)  Romer is active in opinion polling and 
political consulting in many parts of Latin America, and has 
completed several recent studies for the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) in Venezuela.  Graciela Romer told Ambassador 
she would like to offer her services to Embassy Caracas 
and/or WHA to help facilitate the political reconciliation 
between the Venezuelan opposition and the GOV. 
 
2.  (C)  With the recall referendum decided, Romer argued 
that the focus needs to be on political reconciliation and 
governability and would like to use her firm to help this 
process.  In her view, the Carter Center and the OAS have 
been discredited in the eyes of the opposition, and so are 
unable to perform the role of mediator.  She felt that other 
groups, such as the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDP), and private organizations, such as her firm, would be 
better equipped to initiate dialogue between the Venezuelan 
opposition and the more moderate elements associated with 
President Chavez.  Romer mentioned that she has contacts 
within both the opposition and the government, and also 
relayed her impressions of her recent meeting with President 
Chavez.

1. (C)  SUMMARY:  Early in the morning of Saturday October 2, 
85 members of an elite Gendarmeria riot control unit, 
assisted by provincial police, broke up a roadblock and 
forcibly ended the piquetero occupation of an oil depot in 
the town of Caleta Olivia in President Nestor Kirchner,s 
home province of Santa Cruz.  Thirty-six piqueteros were 
arrested and three remain in detention at present.  A 
reliable source indicates that those close to the President, 
and possibly the President himself, ordered the Gendarmeria 
operation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  In a decisive operation, an elite Gendarmeria riot 
control unit broke up a roadblock and ended the piquetero 
occupation of an oil depot in the Santa Cruz town of Caleta 
Olivia on October 2 (see reftels).  While press reports 
indicate that the swift GOA response was a local action 
undertaken by the Gendarmeria and Provincial Police, POLOFF 
has been informed that it was the work of an elite 
Gendarmeria unit ordered into action by the Casa Rosada. 
During an October 3 meeting with POLOFF, General Roberto 
Nieva Malaver, Chief of Operations for the Gendarmeria 
(number four in the organization), outlined the details of 
the operation. 
 
3. (C)  Malaver stated that at approximately 1000 hours on 
October 1 his office received instructions \"from the Casa 
Rosada\" to immediately take action to end the oil depot 
takeover.  He stated that the original instructions demanded 
action by 1700 hours that day, but that he informed his 
Interior Ministry contact that normal deployment procedures 
would necessitate a few days to transport the nearest riot 
control unit to Santa Cruz.  He reported that the Interior 
Ministry then contacted the Argentine Air Force to provide 
needed airlift capability.  Malaver ordered the riot control 
unit stationed in La Pampa to immediately mobilize for 
deployment, and the 85-man unit was airborne with all 
equipment, including attack dogs, by 1600 hours.  While the 
unit was airborne, a federal prosecutor issued a warrant 
authorizing them to disband the protesters.  He reported that 
by 2200 hours the unit had established a command base in 
Caleta Olivia and after coordination with local police and 
medical units, moved on the Piqueteros at or around 0200 
hours.  Malaver relayed that the action \"took less then 15 
minutes\" once it started.  According to Malaver, the riot 
control unit was supported by a large contingent of 
provincial police, and three ambulances, in case of injury. 
He stressed that the unit went into action fully armored but 
without the use of billy-clubs, water hoses or teargas.  He 
stated the decision not to use billy-clubs was made to limit 
possible injury to the Piqueteros; weather conditions 
prevented the use of teargas.  He reported that the 
Gendarmeria suffered two minor casualties.  A Molotov 
cocktail burned one soldier and another was stabbed by the 
sharpened point of a piquetero,s stick.  Malaver also 
reported that the protesters suffered no serious injuries. 
(NOTE: A Vintage Oil executive confirmed to ECONCOUNs that 
the Gendarmeria had cleared the piquetero roadblock on the 
highway in Caleta Olivia, but asserted that the provincial 
police removed the 35 piqueteros that were occupying the top 
of one of the oil tanks in the depot, thereby suggesting two 
separate actions carried out by two distinct groups). 
 
4. (C)  Thirty-six piqueteros were detained and three remain 
in custody at present.  There have been press reports and 
subsequent protests claiming human rights abuses occurred to 
detained piqueteros, but Malaver was quick to point out that 
the alleged abuse reportedly took place after the Gendarmeria 
had handed the detainees over to the Provincial Police. 
Santa Cruz Governor Sergio Acevedo told DCM that he 
suppported the law enforcement action, which he claimed was 
conducted at his request.  He also said that he had agreed to 
look into the allegations of police abuse. 
 
5. (C)  Malaver was clearly proud of his unit\'s success, and 
talked at great length about the difference between the five 
Gendarmeria riot control units and those available to other 
forces.  He stated that, as opposed to federal and provincial 
police forces consisting of regular duty officers that engage 
protesters individually, often resulting in a general melee, 
his forces \"move in like the Roman Legion; they don\'t fight 
as individuals they are trained to stay together and move as 
one unit.\"  He also pointed out that these five units, 
located in strategic areas including Buenos Aires Province 
and La Pampa, train year round solely for this sort of 
mission.  He opined that the Gendarmeria was the only force 
that had units trained and equipped to break up protesters 
with a minimum risk of injury posed to either the soldiers or 
the protesters.  The meeting with POLOFF ended abruptly when 
an aide to Malaver entered the room to remind him he had to 
leave for the airport.  Malaver confided in POLOFF that he 
had been ordered to travel to Santa Cruz to start the process 
of establishing a sixth elite riot control unit to be 
permanently based in the President\'s home province \"as soon 
as possible.\" 
 
6. (C)  After Malaver,s departure, POLOFF continued the 
meeting with Hector Schenone, the Gendarmeria General in 
charge of narcotics control, who explained that the Interior 
Ministry had recently approved the recruitment of 8,000 more 
Gendarmeria over the next four years.  He stated this was at 
least partially in recognition of the increased public 
security role that the force was playing, especially in the 
Province of Buenos Aires.  He intimated that a major obstacle 
facing the force was that its training facility was overtaxed 
with both Gendarmeria recruits and almost 400 recruits for 
the new Buenos Aires Police Force.  He stated that at the 
present time only 1,000 of the 2,000 recruits authorized for 
this year were in training, and it was clear he did not like 
the idea of provincial police recruits taking training slots 
from his force. 
 
7. (C)  COMMENT: Although reaction to piquetero activities 
are historically much harsher in the provinces than the 
potentially-explosive Buenos Aires, this had not been the 
case in Caleta Olivia, the site of repeated labor strife.  It 
is clear that this rapid deployment ordered from the 
President\'s office marks a much more proactive approach by 
Kirchner to protests that affect his traditional center of 
power.  It is of course possible that Kirchner authorized the 
use of force because he has a higher degree of trust in the 
Gendarmeria to intervene without bloodshed than the Federal 
and Provincial Police in the Buenos Aires area.  His order to 
establish a Gendarmeria riot control unit in Santa Cruz seems 
to indicate that he will not brook future piquetero protest 
in the province. END COMMENT.

Alessandro as a non-paper.  Alessandro said that the GOA took 
note and would study our request.  He commented that the 
first two points (i.e. the potential arrest warrants for 
SUMATE leaders and the proposed prohibition of foreign 
funding for certain NGO supporting human rights and 
democracy-building programs) were of &real concern8 to the 
GOA.  Alessandro was less emphatic on the draft press law 
noting that some sectors of the Venezuelan media had 
contributed to the problem by often behaving irresponsibly. 
He said that the solution on the press issue would be for 
both sides to come to an agreement that would limit some of 
the personal attacks made by the media but would avoid 
legislation that would limit press rights. 
 
2. (C) Alessandro said that Argentina had been helpful on 
Venezuela.  (Note:  Alessandro was referring to Kirchner\'s 
past pressure on Chavez to hold the recall referendum and his 
two meetings with representatives of the Coordinadora 
Democratica earlier this year. End Note).  The DCM responded 
that if the GOA came to the decision that it was unwilling to 
issue a public statement, we hoped the GOA might consider 
speaking privately with the Venezuelans regarding these 
issues, stressing the potential impact of these measures 
throughout the hemisphere.  Alessandro agreed to consider 
this request as well and told the DCM that he would keep in 
touch on these issues.

SIPDIS 
Alessandro to discuss planning for next year\'s Summit of the 
Americas and to deliver talking points on Summit preparation. 
 DCM also raised with Alessandro the recent visit to 
Washington of Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Taiana and 
the visit of Foreign Minister Bielsa to Haiti.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) DCM, accompanied by POLCOUNS, met on October 22 with 
Ambassador Dario Alessandro, the Argentine Under Secretary 
for Latin American Policy, and his deputy, the Director 
General for Latin American Policy, Minister Jose Maxwell to 
discuss Summit preparations and other bilateral and 
multilateral issues.  In response to a question from the DCM, 
Alessandro noted that the meeting between Deputy Foreign 
Minister Jorge Taiana and Assistant Secretary Roger Noriega 
had gone well.  He noted the two discussed how Argentina and 
the U.S. could further their cooperative relationship in both 
hemispheric and bilateral affairs.  Noting that OAS 
Ambassador John Maisto was also present at the meeting, 
Alessandro stated a good environment had been established for 
preparations for next year\'s Summit of the Americas. 
 
3.  (C) Alessandro was in broad agreement with the Summit 
points delivered by DCM.  He said Argentina wanted to include 
Caribbean themes in the Summit and would work diligently to 
encourage greater involvement and participation by Caribbean 
nations.  He agreed with the need to obtain comprehensive 
statistics for the Caribbean and said Argentina was already 
in contact with its executive directors at the IFI\'s on this 
subject.  Regarding Summit documents, Alessandro agreed that 
the emphasis should be on a short, concrete declaration.  He 
also agreed on the need to push for commitments on Special 
Summit follow-ups.  He noted that, to date, only seven 
countries had come through with commitments on the Special 
Summit. 
 
4.  (C) DCM stressed that we were already working to identify 
our logistical needs for the Summit and that we hoped to make 
a preliminary site survey by the end of the year.  Alessandro 
said he understood the U.S. had special security and 
logistical requirements and that working level contacts would 
be named in the near future that would coordinate with us on 
these issues. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to other issues, the DCM asked for his 
impressions of Foreign Minister Raphael Bielsa\'s visit to 
Haiti.  Alessandro described the situation as difficult and 
very fluid.  He said the mission was still lacking forces and 
outside resources.  However he said security incidents, while 
continuing, were not a great problem if confronted with 
force.  The real problem, he said, was the total 
infrastructure collapse and complete breakdown of political 
legitimacy of the state.  He noted that the Argentine mission 
had \"totally changed\" as a result of the hurricane from a 
predominately security-related to a humanitarian relief 
operation.  The DCM noted that the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti 
had referred to the Argentine contingent as \"heroes\" for 
their relief work in the Gonaives region.

Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador Gutierrez met October 29 with Foreign 
Minister Raphael Bielsa to convey the letter from the 
Secretary Powell congratulating Argentina on its selection to 
 
SIPDIS 
the United Nations Security Council (reftel A).  The 
Ambassador, who was accompanied by the DCM and POLCOUNS, also 
took the opportunity to review a wide range of bilateral and 
regional issues of mutual concern.  The MFA Director for 
North American Affairs, Ambassador Vicente Espeche Gil also 
sat in on the meeting.  On delivering the letter, the 
Ambassador stated we looked forward to working closely 
Argentina on the Security Council and that we would be 
contacting them soon, both here and with their Mission in New 
York, to arrange for working level consultations on the range 
of key issues facing the Council, especially security issues 
such as counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 
 
3.  (C) FM Bielsa assured the Ambassador of his willingness 
to cooperate closely with us on Security Council matters. 
Bielsa then said \"speaking of the Security Council,\" that for 
Argentina, the situation in Haiti would be one of their top 
priorities when they assumed their seat in January.  Bielsa 
(who recently returned from a visit to Haiti) said Argentina 
was fully committed to Haiti for the \"long haul\" and that 
this commitment included sending additional Argentine troops 
to the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti.  Bielsa said 
MINUSTAH was \"only the beginning\" of what needed to be a 
concerted effort by the international community to develop a 
comprehensive strategic plan to assist in Haiti\'s 
reconstruction.  He said there was an urgent need for \"clear 
politics, sound management, money and more people\" if the 
international effort in Haiti were to succeed.  He said the 
GOA was preparing papers on its thinking on Haiti and would 
forward them to us. 
 
4.  (C) Reflecting on his recent visit to Haiti, Bielsa said 
the situation was very worrying and very complex.  He 
stressed the need to take preventative measures against 
violence which he believed originated from many sectors, both 
political and criminal.  The situation was exacerbated he 
said by the total breakdown of capacity within the country. 
What little infrastructure that remained was rendered useless 
by the lack of maintenance.  He described the actions of 
Argentine troops in Haiti as \"heroic\" noting that medical 
staff had treated over 3,000 patients since their arrival. 
Bielsa said the deployment of Argentine troops to Haiti had 
been unpopular domestically and that the government had been 
accused of being the \"Marines of the U.S.\" but that it was 
important for Argentina to act responsibly and in concert 
with its neighbors on hemispheric issues.  The Ambassador 
reiterated the thanks both President Bush and Secretary 
Powell had expressed to the GOA for their assistance in Haiti 
and stressed that this was an important example of what we 
can accomplish together regionally. 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador said our bilateral relations with 
Argentina in general, and on specific issues in particular, 
were strong.  He assured Bielsa of continued USG support for 
the strengthening of democracy and for strong economic growth 
in Argentina noting we were watching closely the ongoing debt 
restructuring efforts.  The Ambassador referred to the recent 
meeting between Assistant Secretary Noreiga and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Taiana in Washington as an example of how we 
were working to increase cooperation between our countries on 
both bilateral and multilateral issues.  The Ambassador also 
welcomed the upcoming visit to Washington by MFA Under 
Secretary for Foreign Policy Roberto Garcia Moritan for the 
 
SIPDIS 
November 22 pol-mil talks as another example of our 
increasing cooperation.  The Ambassador said that the request 
for a meeting between Bielsa and Secretary Powell had been 
submitted but that the schedules for both were already very 
complicated during the proposed December timeframe. 
(Comment: Bielsa quickly indicated his availability during 
the first week of December again demonstrating his keen 
desire for a meeting.)  When asked about the possible 
ramifications of next week\'s presidential elections, the 
Ambassador underscored the constancy of U.S. strategic 
interests in the region. 
 
6.  (C) Turning to other regional issues, the Ambassador 
thanked Bielsa for his efforts in supporting the 
constitutional government in Bolivia.  The Ambassador 
underscored our concerns about human rights and the future of 
democracy in Venezuela, noting the DCM had recently met with 
the MFA Under Secretary for Latin American Affairs Dario 
Alessandro to raise the potential arrest warrants for SUMATE 
leaders and the proposed restrictions on foreign funding for 
NGO\'s supporting human rights (reftel B).  Bielsa responded 
that he believed the situation in Venezuela was better than 
it was before the referendum but that the GOA was closely 
monitoring the NGO situation.  He said that he had sent 
instructions to Argentina\'s mission in Caracas to maintain 
its dialogue with all segments of Venezuelan society and that 
the GOA would continue to work quietly but firmly behind the 
scenes in support of democracy.  The Ambassador emphasized 
that President Kirchner occupies a special position with 
Chavez and is in a position to exert a very positive 
influence. 
 
7.  (C) On Cuba, Bielsa said relations with the Castro regime 
had gone into a deep freeze in recent months adding that 
Castro\'s refusal to grant a travel permit to Cuban scientist 
Hilda Molina and her mother to visit her son and his family 
in Argentina had become a major stumbling block.  He said the 
GOA was doing all it could to secure travel permits for 
Molina and her mother and had difficulty understanding why 
Castro was so opposed.  He added the Molina problem had 
become a \"bottom line, non-negotiable\" issue for the GOA and, 
barring a resolution, made a proposed visit by First Lady 
(and Senator) Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to Cuba 
unlikely.  Bielsa said, however, that if the First Lady did 
travel to Cuba, it would be contingent on her being allowed 
to visit with dissident spouses (the so-called \"ladies in 
white\") which he did not think likely.  (Comment:  Bielsa did 
not even mention the possibility of a visit by President 
Kirchner.) 
 
8.  (C) Turning to security issues, Bielsa asked the 
Ambassador how the GOA was doing in cooperating with the U.S. 
on border security in the Tri-border region.  The Ambassador 
said we had received excellent cooperation from all branches 
of the Argentinean security services.  Bielsa commented that 
there were different views of the problems in the Tri-border 
region reflecting the different optics of those concerned, 
e.g. the tourism, commercial and security sectors.  However, 
Bielsa stressed that the GOA was \"very attentive\" to our 
security concerns in the Tri-border area. 
9.  (C) On other security issues, the Ambassador informed 
Bielsa of the invitation to observe multilateral maritime 
exercises in support of the President\'s Proliferation 
Security Initiative in Key West, Florida in November (reftel 
C).  He thanked Bielsa for his previous support of the PSI. 
Bielsa thanked the Ambassador for the invitation to send 
observers calling it \"fantastic.\" 
 
10.  (C) Comment:  Bielsa was positive and forthcoming on all 
the issues we raised with him.  Of particular import was his 
unequivocal statement that Argentina would be in Haiti for 
the long haul and is considering sending additional troops. 
Also of considerable interest were Bielsa\'s comments on the 
cooling relationship with Cuba.  His commitment that a 
potential visit by the First Lady to Cuba was contingent on 
Cuba\'s allowing her to meet with dissidents was especially 
welcome and represented new policy ground for the GOA. 
 
11.  (C) The conversation with Bielsa demonstrated clearly 
that the GOA is prepared to move forward in a substantive 
manner on increased cooperation with the U.S. as set forth in 
the proposed action agenda discussed recently in the meeting 
between Assistant Secretary Noreiga and Deputy Secretary 
Taiana.  Bielsa\'s eagerness to meet with the Secretary also 
is a strong indication of his desire to move our bilateral 
cooperation to a new level.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: COURT RELEASES DOCUMENTS SUPPORTING SEPTEMBER 2 
ACQUITTAL DECISION IN AMIA TERRORIST BOMBING TRIAL 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 2540 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
2.  On October 29, the Third Federal Oral Court finally 
released the documentation supporting the three-judge panel\'s 
September 2 acquittal of all 22 Argentine defendants 
(including the 5 principle defendants - 4 Buenos Aires 
policemen and the chop-shop owner who implicated them) in the 
1994 AMIA Jewish Community Center terrorist bombing (Reftel). 
In that September 2 decision, the Court also called for an 
investigation into the conduct of the bombing investigation 
and trial by the original criminal judge Juan Jose Galeano, 
other court officials, former Menem government officials, 
assorted individuals, and even members of a bi-cameral 
congressional committee formed at the time to investigate the 
attack. 
 
3.  In the 4,500-page decision released by the Court, the 
Panel conceded that the source of the explosion that devasted 
the AMIA center, killing 85 people, was a van loaded with 300 
to 400 kilograms of explosives.  After that point, however, 
the Court turns the case on its head, accusing Judge Galeano, 
other court and government officials, members of Congress and 
others of conspiring to fabricate a case against the police 
in order to provide scapegoats in the attack.  The Court 
found that Galeano\'s star witness, chop-shop owner Carlos 
Telledin, was paid USD 400,000 in monies from the Argentine 
intelligence service (SIDE) -- with the knowledge and 
complicity of Galeano, former head of SIDE Hugo Anzorreguy, 
and former Menem-era Interior Minister Carlos Corach -- to 
implicate his police co-defendants. 
 
4.  The Court has ordered that a new investigation be opened 
against Galeano for \"arbitrary consideration of evidence,\" 
lack of impartiality and bribery; and against former Interior 
Minister Corach and SIDE head Anzorreguy for their role in 
the illegal payment made to Telleldin and their support for 
Galeano\'s activities.  Also to be investigated for their 
alleged role in the \"conspiracy\" to implicate the accused 
police officers is former Delegation of Jewish Associations 
(DAIA) president Ruben Bereja, and a number of members of a 
bi-cameral Congressional Commission formed at the time.  In 
related news, Judge Galeano is scheduled to appear November 5 
before the Council of Magistrates for the beginning of what 
is likely to be impeachment proceedings against him. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Interested parties are just starting to 
wade through the 4,500 pages of the court decision and none 
of the principle parties have made any substantive public 
comment yet.  Galeano, Corach, DAIA, AMIA and others have 10 
days to appeal the decision.  Although the AMIA investigation 
now has turned inward (i.e. looking at the actions of 
investigators and authorities rather than the perpetrators), 
at the end of the day the families of the victims of the 1994 
bombing will still be looking to the government to identify 
the perpetrators of the attack and try to bring them to 
justice.  With all of the evidence collected by Galeano now 
called into question by this court decision, the danger lies 
in the possibility that good leads and evidence will be 
tossed out with the possibly-tainted.

Turkmenistan, Sudan, Zimbabwe and Iran.  Villegas noted that 
these were not new issues and said he anticipated Argentina 
voting largely as it has this year in Geneva, and last year 
in New York. Villegas explained that, due to the country\'s 
recent history with human rights violations, Argentina, in 
principle, is opposed to \"no action\" motions and has tended 
to vote against them. 
 
2. (U) Belarus:  No change.  Villegas noted that the Belarus 
Foreign Minister had recently been in Buenos Aires and had 
pressed the GOA to vote against the Belarus resolution. 
Villegas stated that Argentina had voted against the no 
action motion in Geneva and had abstained on the substance of 
the resolution itself.  He said Argentina\'s position would 
likely remain the same, despite the lobbying from Belarus. 
Villegas and Gomez did not have any details on Belarus\' 
resolution on the U.S. electoral system. 
 
3.  (U) Turkmenistan:  No change.  Villegas explained that 
Argentina had voted in favor of the resolution on 
Turkmenistan in Geneva and that the GOA position would likely 
remain the same. 
 
4.  (U) Sudan: No change. 
 
5.  (U) Zimbabwe:  No Change.  Villegas said that Argentina 
voted against the no action motion. 
 
6.  (C) Iran:  No Change.  Villegas explained the GOA\'s 
rationale for its abstention on the Iran resolution in the 
3rd Committee last year and likely action this year.  He 
noted that, while serious human rights issues remain, at 
least some elements of the Iranian government, i.e. the 
executive, had been making efforts to improve the situation, 
but that much of this effort had been blocked by the 
legislature.   Villegas noted that these efforts, such as 
allowing four Special Rapporteurs to visit Iran and extending 
an open invitation to other UN commissions, were a large 
commitment and had to be recognized.

 1.  (C) Ambassador Gutierrez delivered on November 12 the 
Article 98 talking points from reftel to the Argentine Under 
Secretary for Foreign Policy Roberto Garcia Moritan. 
 
SIPDIS 
Ambassador Gutierrez underscored the importance of Article 98 
agreements in our bilateral relationships and noted we 
currently have 96 such agreements worldwide.  He said 
obtaining an Article 98 agreement with Argentina remained a 
priority for both the Embassy and the Administration and that 
this would be a topic of major importance in Garcia Moritan\'s 
visit to Washington next week for the U.S.-Argentina pol-mil 
bilats.  Regarding potential pressure on Argentina from EU 
countries not to enter into an Article 98 agreement, the 
Ambassador pointed out that this was a bilateral issue 
between our countries designed to protect our mutual 
interests. 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador Garcia Moritan acknowledged the importance 
of reaching an accommodation with us and reiterated 
Argentina\'s desire to continue discussions on a possible 
agreement.  He opined, however, that the current political 
dynamic between President Kirchner and the Argentine congress 
(where Kirchner lacks a strong personal support base) made an 
Article 98 agreement problematic for the present.  Garcia 
Moritan felt that when Kirchner solidified his own 
constituency in Congress (which he is convinced will occur in 
next year\'s legislative elections), a mutually acceptable 
agreement protecting both U.S. and Argentine interests could 
be reached. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: The good news is that Argentina understands 
the importance we attach to reaching an Article 98 agreement 
and its importance to expanded military cooperation with us. 
Garcia Moritan\'s commitment to continued discussions on the 
issue was welcome even if his placing the blame for lack of 
progress on Congress was dubious.  Garcia Moritan\'s visit to 
Washington next week will provide an excellent opportunity 
for senior leaders to reinforce once again the importance we 
attach to a successful conclusion of these discussions.  End

1.  (C)  The GOA continues to pursue what it refers to as a 
policy of constructive engagement toward Cuba on democracy 
and human rights issues.  The Presidency and Foreign Ministry 
argue that engagement and the influence that comes with it -- 
however limited -- is the best way to promote reform in Cuba. 
 They point to their advocacy of the case of Cuban physician 
Dr. Hilda Molina, who has to date been refused permission to 
travel to Argentina to visit her son.  The GOA has been 
quietly pressing the GOC to allow Dr. Molina to travel to 
Argentina, and argues that securing this permission advances 
the cause of human rights in Cuba.  The Ambassador, DCM and 
senior USG visitors, including former Presidential Envoy 
Reich and U.S. Ambassador to the OAS Maisto, have repeatedly 
stressed strong USG disagreement with the GOA approach. 
 
2.  (C)  Senior contacts at the Foreign Ministry privately 
recognize the absence of democracy in Cuba and violations of 
human rights, but consistently argue that engagement is the 
most effective means of addressing the situation.  They argue 
that Argentina is committed to achieving the same end as the 
U.S. -- a democratic Cuba integrated into the rest of the 
Western Hemisphere.  Rumors of a pending visit to Cuba by 
President Nestor Kirchner have circulated for some time. 
Foreign Minister Bielsa told the Ambassador on October 29 
that relations with the Castro regime had become distinctly 
cooler in recent months over Castro\'s refusal to grant the 
travel permit to Dr. Molina.  Bielsa said that Molina had 
become a \"bottom line, non-negotiable\" issue for the GOA and, 
barring a resolution, made a proposed visit by First Lady, 
Senator Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, unlikely.  Bielsa 
said, however, that if the First Lady did travel to Cuba, it 
would be contingent on her being allowed to visit with 
dissident spouses (the so called \"ladies in white\") which he 
did not think likely.  (Comment:  Bielsa did not even mention 
the possibility of a visit by President Kirchner.  It bears 
watching, however, what effect--if any--the recent release of 
several Cuban dissidents will have on GOA thinking.) 
 
3.  (U)  The GOA imposes no requirement to register foreign 
direct investment and the Embassy has been unable to uncover 
any major investment by Argentine nationals or Argentine 
public corporations in Cuba.  Trade relations are small and 
limited by Cuba\'s hard currency shortages to purchase 
Argentine agricultural products.  Argentine exports to Cuba 
in 2003 were valued at USD 23.3 million.  For January - 
September 2004, exports were reported at USD 71 million, a 
367.2 percent increase over the same period from the previous 
year.  Imports from Cuba in 2003 were USD 1.2 million.  From 
January - September 2004, imports were USD 984 thousand, down 
1.6 percent from the same period in 2003.

THE PACK IN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 00023 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Lino Gutierrez for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: POLOFFS recently traveled to Mendoza to 
attend a political development conference, meet with leading 
political leaders, and participate in a cosmic ray 
observatory dedication ceremony.  Mendoza enjoys greater 
political diversity than the nation as a whole, with three 
well-developed political parties and a host of minor parties 
competing for power in the province.  Mendoza\'s economy is 
also growing faster than the nation on average, boosted by 
strong exports in wine, tourism, petroleum, and agricultural 
products.  The province has been making good on promises to 
the scientific community with its support for The Pierre 
Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory that is putting Mendoza on the 
map for scientific research.  POFOFFS found that people in 
Mendoza, as in many other provinces, have a noticeably more 
upbeat outlook on Argentina and the Argentine economy than 
people in Buenos Aires.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
A Diverse Political Environment 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) On November 20-21, POLOFF attended a political 
development conference sponsored by the International 
Republican Institute (IRI) that brought representatives of 
Ricardo Lopez Murphy\'s Recrear party from throughout 
Argentina with the goal of developing a national party 
structure.  Delegates to the conference were optimistic about 
Recrear\'s chances of building a nationwide movement, but they 
acknowledged the daunting obstacles facing them in 
challenging the political dominance of the Peronist Party 
(PJ).  Many delegates expressed privately to POLOFF the hope 
that alliances with Mauricio Macri\'s Commitment for Change 
movement or the Radical Civil Union (UCR) would materialize 
to help Recrear have a greater impact nationally.  A 
Representative of the UCR, which currently holds the 
governorship of Mendoza, attended the conference.  In one of 
the panel discussions, the UCR representative exhorted the 
Recrear delegates to not attempt to go it alone, arguing that 
Recrear could only build a true opposition to the PJ working 
in concert with the UCR and Elisa Carrio\'s Affirmation for an 
Egalitarian Republic (ARI). 
 
3.  (C) In addition to attending the political development 
conference, POLOFF also met with leaders from all three major 
political parties in Mendoza: the UCR, the PJ, and the 
Democratic Party, as well as a key ARI leader.  UCR National 
Deputy and former governor Roberto Iglesias gave an upbeat 
assessment of the province politically and economically.  He 
felt one of the biggest challenges for the UCR-led provincial 
government was the difficulty in reaching agreements with the 
other two political parties due to the fact that both parties 
are divided and lack strong leaders.  He felt the UCR was 
starting to recover and reorganize from their disastrous 
showing in the 2003 presidential elections, with the election 
of Adolfo Stubrin to head the UCR convention and the recent 
UCR Congress as the first steps.  Iglesias felt the 2003 
presidential vote was more of a vote for a change of any 
kind, rather than an endorsement of the PJ.  He thought that 
over the long-term there would be more political space for 
other political parties, like the UCR, as is already the case 
in Mendoza.  Roberto Iglesias did not discount the utility of 
political alliances, but argued that the party could not 
attempt to align with every possible political force and 
expect to be taken seriously.  For example, Iglesias was 
strongly against the Grupo Olavarria\'s, a break-away faction 
of the UCR in BA province, attempts to align with Kirchner. 
Iglesias acknowledged that the greatest obstacle to the 
recovery of the UCR nationally was its lack of strength in BA 
province and BA city, arguing that the downfall of the De la 
Rua Administration took much of the BA party structure with 
it. 
 
4.  (C) Rodolfo Arland, chief advisor the President of the PJ 
bloc of provincial deputies, and PJ Provincial Deputy 
Frederico Uriguen largely confirmed National Deputy Iglesias\' 
description of the Mendoza PJ party as divided and lacking 
strong leaders, but were still optimistic that the party 
would win the governorship in 2007.  Federico Uriguen 
described Peronism as a combination of nationalism and 
populism that is completely American in its origin (meaning 
Western Hemisphere), as opposed to the UCR that draws its 
roots from Spain and France.  This background gives the PJ a 
much greater ability to garner support from the lower classes 
than the UCR, which has been especially important over the 
last several years of economic difficulties.  Uriguen 
characterized himself as a political reformer within the 
provincial PJ.  He felt most PJ politicians in Mendoza were 
willing to work with Kirchner, but were not beholden to him 
nor his methods.  Rodolfo Arland described himself as a 
traditional Peronist, stemming from his days as a student 
during the military dictatorship.  Arland argued that many 
things were going well in the province, but that the economic 
improvements were in spite of the mismanagement of the UCR 
government. 
 
5.  (C) Rodolfo Arland told POLOFF that corruption was a real 
problem in the province, which was demonstrated first hand 
when two motorcycle police officers pulled Rodolfo Arland 
over, with POLOFF in the passenger seat, allegedly for 
speeding.  Arland had been taking POLOFF on a short tour of 
the city, driving slowly to show him the sights.  The police 
officers claimed their radar gun showed that Arland was 
driving 80 kph in a 40 kph zone, something that was extremely 
unlikely given the pace of Arland\'s tour.  Neither POLOFF nor 
Arland saw a radar gun, nor would the police officers show 
Arland the gun when he asked to see it.  The police officers 
asked Arland to step out of the vehicle, which Arland later 
told POLOFF was done to avoid any witnesses and provide 
Arland an opportunity to offer the bribe that the police 
officers wanted.  Arland stepped out of the vehicle and 
pulled out his cell phone and told the officers he was 
calling his good friend the Minister of Security to let him 
know that his officers were operating with faulty radar 
equipment because he could not possibly have been driving at 
more than 40 kph.  (Rodolfo Arland, before moving to the 
provincial legislature, was the chief advisor to the Mendoza 
Minister of Security.)  The officers replied that this was 
not necessary and that they must have made a mistake and 
handed him back his license and wished him a nice day. 
Arland told POLOFF as they drove away that this type of 
corruption was unfortunately fairly frequent, as police 
officers are poorly paid and the procedures for paying fines 
are so cumbersome that people find it much easier to offer 
bribes to avoid the hassle.  Arland felt the officers spotted 
a foreign-made car with two well-dressed men inside and 
figured they would likely pay a sizable bribe. 
 
6.  (C) Horacio Migliozzi, the Provincial Director of 
Investigations, briefed POLOFF on his efforts to improve the 
image of the police, but stated that his efforts have been 
limited by police corruption.  He stated that corruption is a 
major problem in the province; he himself has been 
responsible for sending five officers to prison, and 
continues to receive death threats as a result.  As an 
example of police corruption, Migliozzi explained that if 
there is a bank robbery his first step in the investigation 
is to get a list of police working in the area at the time 
and then figure out which ones were involved.  He believes 
with a combination of proper supervision, hiring new officers 
and an increase in police salaries the situation can be 
improved, but admits it will be uphill battle. 
 
7.  (C) Dr. Omar Demarchi, President of the Democratic Party 
and Mayor of Lujan de Cuyo, the heart of the wine-growing 
region, described his party as being in the rebuilding stage. 
 The Democratic Party is the oldest party in Mendoza, tracing 
its roots back to the mid-19th century.  The Democratic Party 
has been unable to retain its past dominance of Mendoza 
politics, as it is seen by many Mendocinos as having worked 
too closely with the military dictatorship.  The Democratic 
Party still holds a number of seats in the provincial 
legislature, but fared poorly in the last two races for 
governor.  Demarchi displayed an almost egotistical sense of 
confidence about the party\'s ability to regain the 
governorship in 2007, although all the other political 
leaders and analysts POLOFF spoke with in Mendoza felt the 
party\'s chances for a major resurgence are slim. 
 
8.  (C) Gustavo Gutierrez, who was Carrio\'s running mate in 
2003 and was formally a congressman for the Democratic Party, 
attributed Mendoza\'s strong economic growth in discussions 
with POLOFF to the wine industry and Mendoza\'s proximity to 
Chile.  Gutierrez felt that Mendoza and Argentina as a whole 
had been severely damaged by the populism of both the PJ and 
the UCR.  He felt Argentina needed a new direction and a 
focus on institution-building that he thought Carrio could 
best provide for the country.  Carrio\'s emphasis on 
institution-building and good governance were the reasons 
Gutierrez gave to explain how a right-of-center individual 
like himself could work with a left-wing politician like 
Carrio.  Gutierrez said he did not plan to seek elected 
office before 2007, choosing to focus on his trucking 
business, but he would accept the spot as vice presidential 
candidate again if Carrio asked him in 2007.  Gutierrez 
readily acknowledges the ideological difference between 
himself and Carrio.  He stated to POLOFF that he worked with 
Lopez Murphy in the past and was much more ideologically 
aligned to him and Recrear, but felt Lopez Murphy was \"too 
intellectual\" to effectively govern Argentina.  Gutierrez, 
decision to run with Carrio was yet another example that 
ideology is often not the deciding factor in Argentine 
politics.  Gutierrez felt that political alliances might be 
possible between ARI and the other opposition parties, 
acknowledging that an agreement existed between Carrio and 
Lopez Murphy to not compete against each other in the 2005 
elections, with Lopez Murphy agreeing to run in BA province 
and Carrio running in BA city. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Mendoza\'s Economy Booming, but Only in Certain Sectors 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
9.  (C) Leading economist Silvia Jardel of the Consejo 
Empresario Mendocino (CEM) told POLOFF that Mendoza\'s economy 
has been growing more rapidly than the rest of the nation 
since recovering from the recession the province experienced 
between 1999 and 2002.  She argued the main drivers of the 
strong growth rates were the petroleum industry and wine 
exports.  Mendoza also has a strong agricultural sector, with 
the main exports being garlic, pears, olives, peaches, and 
apples.  Of the 15 billion pesos worth of goods and services 
produced in Mendoza in 2003, 19 percent of it was exported, 
representing the fastest growing sector of the economy. 
Mendoza has increasingly benefited from Argentina\'s tourism 
boom, with tens of thousands of tourists every year coming to 
enjoy Mendoza\'s mountains, good weather, and wine.  At the 
same time, Silvia Jardel pointed out that traditional 
industries in Mendoza, such as manufacturing and 
construction, have been undergoing a severe contraction over 
the last few years.  The manufacturing sector fell 26.2 
percent and the construction sector declined 32.1 percent in 
the period between 1993 and 2003.  Jardel pointed out that 
this was creating greater income distribution disparities, as 
those workers tied to fast growing industries like the wine 
and tourism sectors dramatically increased their household 
incomes, while those tied to declining industries faced 
increasing economic hardship. 
 
10.  (C) One major obstacle facing even the hottest parts of 
the export sector is the difficulty in obtaining credit and 
investment.  According to Jardel, despite the recently 
successful restructuring of the province\'s USD 250 million 
Aconcagua bond, even Mendoza\'s wine industry has a difficult 
time obtaining badly needed foreign credit and investment due 
to the reluctance of international investors to invest in 
Argentina while the national debt restructuring is still 
pending.  The petroleum industry has an even more difficult 
time obtaining credit and investment, Jardel argued, due to 
the GOA\'s continued intervention in the energy sector making 
it difficult for private energy producers to make a profit. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Cosmic Ray Optical Detector Observatory Dedication 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
11.  (U) On November 13, POLOFF attended the dedication 
ceremony for the third of four optical detector observatories 
planned for the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory located 
in Malargue, Mendoza.  For a complete description of the 
Observatory and the science behind the study of cosmic rays 
see reftel, or visit the Observatories website at 
. 
 
12.  (C) The Observatory is an international undertaking 
budgeted at USD 54 million, receiving major funding from a 
large number of donor nations including the United States, 
Argentina, Italy and Germany.  Argentina is the second 
largest donor after the United States, with the federal 
government originally pledging USD 10 million and the 
Province of Mendoza pledging USD 5 million.  Due to the 
Argentine economic collapse the project managers have been 
forced to look elsewhere for the USD10 million pledged by the 
GOA, while the Province has slowly worked to fulfill its 
commitment.  Mendoza Governor Julio Cobos presided over the 
recent ceremony with members of the Italian Science 
Institute, and promised that the Province would make good on 
its USD 5 million dollar pledge in the next three years. 
While project managers continue to negotiate with GOA 
officials regarding funding, they remain skeptical that any 
significant amount will be forthcoming and federal 
representation was noticeably lacking at the event. 
 
13.  (C) The new Observatory is a prime example of the type 
of funding provided by the Province.  While the Government of 
Italy funded the newly dedicated optical detector, the 
provincial government provided vital infrastructure support 
needed to bring the detector on-line.  For example, Cobos 
recently approved the installation of a high-tension power 
line running more than 50 miles directly to the detector at 
an estimated cost of USD 400,000.  POLOFF was informed by a 
provincial official that the Governor rationalized the 
expense by arguing that the power line brought power to the 
citizens living near the detector, but admitted that the less 
than 20 goat herders living in the area without running water 
probably would not be signing up for electrical service 
anytime soon.  In these difficult financial times POLOFF 
expected to find ample criticism among opposition parties for 
Cobos\'s decision to meet the Province\'s commitments to the 
project, but support for the Observatory appears to cross all 
political and cultural lines in the Province.  Celso Jacque, 
National Senator for Mendoza and member of the opposition 
Peronist Party, told POLOFF that the Observatory project was 
an example of \"positive international investment.\"  Jacque is 
a former mayor of Malargue and compared the impact of the 
Observatory to that of the oil industry in the early 90s. 
He stated that while the oil companies did bring jobs and 
money to the region, when they left the city suffered over 45 
percent unemployment.  He stressed that his people were worse 
off after the oil boom because they had abandoned their 
traditional jobs.  By comparison, he praised the Observatory 
and the scientific community for the positive and 
long-lasting changes they have made to the quality of life in 
the region.  The Observatory is overwhelmingly seen locally, 
and within the scientific community involved, as a positive 
example of international cooperation in Argentina.

Comment

14.  (C) Mendoza\'s political and economic diversity provides 
a model for the rest of Argentina.  It was refreshing to see 
Recrear\'s attempt to build a national party structure, 
although they have a difficult road in front of them in order 
to achieve a level of organization that will allow them to 
compete with the more established parties.  Corruption, 
especially in the police force, is a crucial issue that the 
provincial government needs to address.  Mendoza\'s economy is 
booming, although it is evident that like the rest of 
Argentina, Mendoza is counting on a successful restructuring 
of the national debt to bring in the investment necessary to 
sustain the economic recovery.

 1. (U) Following the Molina incident at the Argentine 
embassy in Havana on December 16, Chief of Cabinet Alberto 
Fernandez told reporters on Friday that a \"clarification\" 
would be made later in the day regarding the status of the 
Argentine ambassador to Cuba, Raul Taleb, and the MFA chief 
of cabinet, Eduardo Valdes, following reports that both would 
be asked to resign for allegedly mishandling the Molina 
affair.  (Indeed, the pro-Kirchner Pagina 12 was already 
referring to Valdes as the \"ex-chief of cabinet.\")  The 
Fernandez press conference follows stories in all the major 
dailies reporting on President Kirchner\'s fury at the bungled 
attempt to secure permission from the Cuban government for 
Molina to travel to Argentina. 
 
2. (C) Castro\'s continued refusal to allow Molina and her 
mother to travel to Argentina (reftels) continues to 
complicate Kirchner\'s policy of \"constructive engagement\" 
with the Castro regime and has now caused a rift between the 
Casa Rosada and members of its Foreign Ministry team.  One of 
the Foreign Minister\'s senior advisors, Ambassador Fernando 
Petrella, confirmed to the DCM on Friday that Kirchner is 
very upset with the way the MFA has handled the entire Molina 
affair in general (including the embassy incident) and, in 
particular, with the Foreign Ministry making public his 
personal and emotional letter to Castro requesting permission 
for Molina and her mother to travel to Argentina for 
Christmas.  Castro\'s public rejection of that request did not 
reflect well on Kirchner\'s prestige.  Petrella said that 
Kirchner was also upset with Bielsa\'s statements regarding 
Molina while in Washington to meet with the Secretary. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  While we have no confirmation at this time 
that Valdes and Taleb are out, if heads are to roll, they are 
convenient scapegoats.  Reports that Bielsa\'s job is also in 
jeopardy are likely premature.  Already an outsider to 
Kirchner\'s tight inner circle, Bielsa\'s position has no doubt 
been further eroded.  In his favor, however, is the fact that 
Kirchner has no ready replacement for Bielsa and would likely 
be very reluctant to make such a change on the eve of 
Argentina assuming the presidency of the UN Security Council 
in January.  Kirchner\'s anger and embarrassment over the 
handling of the Molina case, while publicly directed at his 
own foreign affairs team, is ultimately a stinging reminder 
of the pitfalls of \"constructive engagement\" with the Castro 
regime.

SUBJECT: ARGENTINE CHAPTER OF 2004-2005 INCSR PART I 
 
REF: STATE 248987 
 
I. Summary 
 
1.  Argentina is not a major drug producing country, but it 
is a transit country for cocaine flowing from neighboring 
Bolivia, Peru and Colombia primarily destined for Europe. 
Argentina is also a transit route for Colombian heroin en 
route to the U.S East Coast (primarily New York).  Due to its 
advanced chemical production facilities, Argentina continues 
to be a source for precursor chemicals.  According to 
Argentine Government (GOA) statistics, there was more cocaine 
seized in the first three quarters of 2004 than in the entire 
2003 calendar year.  In addition to Argentine traffickers, 
there is evidence that Colombian drug traffickers have 
greatly increased their presence in all aspects of the 
Argentine drug trade.  In 2004 there was an increase in 
domestic cocaine production using coca base imported from 
Bolivia.  In late 2004, the GOA seized a Colombian-run 
cocaine laboratory located in the Buenos Aires area 
reportedly capable of producing up to 300 kilos of cocaine. 
This may signal a new chapter in the global war on drugs, as 
Colombian narcotics traffickers search out alternative bases 
of operations and transit routes in response to the increased 
pressure of Plan Colombia.  Also of concern is that according 
to GOA statistics, domestic drug use continues on the 
upswing.  The dangerous trends of increased domestic drug 
consumption and production coupled with the increased 
activity of Colombian drug traffickers are indications that 
the situation in Argentina is at a crucial point. 
 
2.  The GOA recognizes the increase in narcotics trafficking 
and consumption, and during 2004 has taken concrete steps 
toward combating these growing problems.  In September, 
following ten years of negotiations, the GOA signed an INL 
Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the U.S., both demonstrating 
its increased willingness to work with the U.S. on narcotics 
related issues, and enabling the U.S. to begin providing 
assistance to the GOA.  In December, the Ministry of the 
Interior started developing a National Security Plan 
targeting specifically the area of drug trafficking along its 
border area with Bolivia and Paraguay, and has requested DEA 
assistance in both the planning and execution phases of this 
vital process.  Also in December, the GOA cabinet office in 
charge of prevention issues (SEDRONAR) announced plans to 
create the first ever national drug prevention plan 
emphasizing youth education and public awareness.  SEDRONAR 
has asked Post,s INL representative to be involved in the 
project and to assist in obtaining regional expertise from 
neighboring countries.  Narcotics use and trafficking are 
important issues in Argentina, and the GOA,s relationship 
with the USG in narcotics-related issues is extremely close 
and positive.  Argentina is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention. 
 
II.  Status of Country 
 
3.  While cocaine production is increasing, Argentina is not 
a major drug producing country.  Because of its advanced 
chemical production facilities, it is one of South America\'s 
largest producers of chemicals used to manufacture almost all 
the precursors necessary to process cocaine and heroin. 
Marijuana remains the most commonly smuggled and consumed 
drug, with cocaine HC1 and inhalants ranked second and third. 
 Recently the use of Paco, coca base mixed with toxic 
chemicals, has increased in Argentina.  Paco is a relatively 
inexpensive and addictive drug similar to crack, and is 
popular among low-income youth.  Bolivia is the primary 
source of narcotics entering Argentina, but narcotics also 
enter via Paraguay and Brazil.  The trafficking of Colombian 
heroin through Argentina to the U.S. East Coast has decreased 
in 2004 due to the capture of a well-organized heroin 
trafficking ring in December 2003, but heroin trafficking via 
commercial air carriers remains a concern.  Seizures of 
amphetamines and ecstasy (MDMA), a synthetic stimulant with 
hallucinogenic properties, are increasing. 
 
III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2004 
 
4.  Policy Initiatives.  The government actively targets the 
trafficking, sale, and use of illegal narcotics.   Internal 
Security is one of the highest profile issues in Argentina 
today, and the fight against crime in Argentina is synonymous 
with the fight against drug traffickers and drug use.  In 
September 2004, President Nestor Kirchner moved the Security 
Secretariat from the Justice Ministry back to the Ministry of 
 
SIPDIS 
the Interior, a move that is widely seen as significantly 
raising the profile of security related issues.  In December 
2004, the Interior Minister announced plans to develop a 
national security plan to deal with the drug trafficking 
problem.  The Interior Ministry is working with SEDRONAR, the 
Gendarmeria National (border guards), Aduanas (Customs), the 
Federal Police and Provincial leadership and law enforcement 
on this issue. 
 
5.  Accomplishments.  From November 2003 to October 2004, the 
DEA-funded Northern Border Task Force (NBTF) seized in excess 
of 54,910 kilograms of illicit chemicals, down significantly 
from 153,569.50 kilograms during the same period in 2003. 
While the amount of illicit chemicals seized was down in 
2004, the amounts seized indicates that chemical diversion 
remains a serious problem.  The NBTF and Group Condor seized 
691 Kilograms of cocaine, including base, and arrested 139 
traffickers in FY2004 as compared with 507.88 kilograms of 
cocaine and 207 traffickers in 2003.  A major benefit derived 
from these operations has been the enhanced cooperation 
between the agencies in the conduct of joint investigations. 
 
6.  According to statistics provided by SEDRONAR, in the 
first nine months of 2004, GOA law enforcement seized 12 
clandestine cocaine laboratories capable of processing an 
estimated 565 kilograms of cocaine.  Not included in 
SEDRONAR\'s statistics is the November 2004 GOA seizure of the 
largest cocaine lab ever discovered in Argentina, reportedly 
capable of producing more than half as much cocaine as all 
the other labs seized in 2004 combined.  In comparison, eight 
labs were seized in 2003, and only 15 small labs were seized 
between 1999 and 2002. 
 
7.  According to SEDRONAR, 2,155 kilograms of cocaine were 
seized in the first three quarters of 2004, compared to 1,918 
kilograms of cocaine for all of 2003.  Also according to 
SEDRONAR, 43,920 kilograms of marijuana were seized in the 
first three quarters of 2004, compared to 45,553 kilograms 
during the same period in 2003.  SEDRONAR also reports that 
29.8 metric tons of coca leaf were seized during the first 
three quarters of 2004, down sharply from the 39.5 metric 
tons seized during the same period in 2003.  Seizure totals 
for the last three years are considerably lower then the 91.3 
metric tons seized in 2001. 
 
8.  Law Enforcement Efforts.   The Ministry of the Interior, 
in coordination with SEDRONAR, directs federal 
counternarcotics policy.  The primary federal forces involved 
are the Federal Police, the Gendarmeria, Aduanas, National 
Air Police (PAN), and the Prefectura Naval (Coast Guard). 
Provincial police forces also play an integral part in 
counternarcotics operations.  The GOA has recently signaled 
an increased dedication to combating both narcotics 
trafficking and consumption and are actively taking measures 
to increase coordination between the various law enforcement 
agencies. 
 
9.  All of Argentina\'s security forces face continuing severe 
counternarcotics budget limitations which have hampered 
investment in training and equipment.  Also, weak 
coordination between law enforcement agencies continues to 
lessen GOA effectiveness.  The GOA recognizes these problems 
and has taken steps to alleviate them.  The Gendarmeria, for 
example, has been authorized to recruit an additional 2,000 
members in 2004 and one of the primary goals of the proposed 
National Security Plan is to seek methods to greatly increase 
interagency cooperation. 
 
10.  Corruption.   Corruption remains a high profile issue in 
Argentina and the GOA continues to make efforts to eliminate 
corruption and prosecute those implicated in corruption 
investigations.  The GOA has created the Anti-Corruption 
Office within the Executive Branch that is responsible for 
investigating suspected instances of corruption.  Since its 
inception, the office has initiated more than 1,000 
investigations, some of which in recent months have either 
gone or are heading to trial.  In 2004, the former 
Environment Secretary Maria Julia Alsogaray was convicted on 
corruption charges and is currently incarcerated.  The GOA 
does not facilitate illicit production or distribution of 
narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances 
or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions. 
 
11.  Agreements and Treaties.  Argentina remains very active 
in multilateral counternaroctics organizations such as the 
Inter American Drug Abuse Commission, the International Drug 
Enforcement Conference (IDEC), and the United Nations Drug 
Control Program.  The GOA hosted the IDEC in 2000 and played 
an active role in IDEC 2001-4.  In 2004, Argentina continued 
to urge MERCOSUR (Common Market of South American Nations) to 
play a larger role in money laundering and chemical precursor 
diversion investigations. 
 
12.  Argentina is a party to the UN convention Against 
Transitional Organized Crime and two of its protocols 
(trafficking in persons and alien smuggling), and has signed 
but not yet ratified the third protocol (firearms).  The GOA 
has bilateral narcotics cooperation agreements with many 
neighboring countries.  The United Kingdom, Germany, 
Australia, France and Italy provide limited training and 
equipment support.  In 1998, a witness protection program for 
key witnesses in drug-related prosecutions was created.  In 
1997, the U.S. and Argentina signed a new extradition treaty, 
which entered into force on June 15, 2000.  A Memorandum of 
Understanding between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and 
SEDRONAR dealing with the exchange of financial information 
relating to money laundering was also signed in 1995.  In 
1990, Argentina and the USG signed a mutual legal assistance 
treaty that entered into force in 1993.  Argentina is a party 
to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 
13.  Cultivation/Production.  Illicit cultivation of 
marijuana remains negligible, and no other narcotics are 
cultivated in Argentina.  There was a large increase in both 
the number and size of clandestine cocaine laboratories 
seized in 2004 that indicates an increase in domestic 
narcotic production, but the amount of cocaine produced 
annually in Argentina is still small when compared to other 
nations in the region. 
 
14.  Drug Flow/Transit.  Most Argentine officials agree that 
drug trafficking is a growing problem.  The bulk of cocaine 
and marijuana enters Argentina via Bolivia utilizing the 
remote and often rugged land border between Bolivia and the 
provinces of Salta and Jujuy.  Narcotics smugglers also move 
cocaine and marijuana across the river border between 
Paraguay and the provinces of Misiones and Corrientes. 
Heroin and some cocaine enter Argentina via commercial 
aircraft.  Increasingly, GOA officials are becoming concerned 
about the use of small private aircraft to carry loads of 
narcotics into Argentina from Bolivia and Paraguay.  GOA 
officials acknowledge that only a small percentage of 
Argentine airspace is covered by radar and, in the absence of 
effective radar information, it is simply impossible to gauge 
the number of aircraft entering Argentina undetected.  The 
GOA recognizes the lack of radar coverage and is actively 
pursuing the purchase of several mobile radar units.  Based 
upon intelligence reporting, Post,s DEA Attach believes the 
highest volume method of narcotics transportation from 
Argentina is via containers passing through Argentina\'s 
maritime port system.  As a member of MERCOSUR, Argentina 
cannot open and inspect sealed containers from another member 
state that pass through the country without direct 
intelligence on a specific container.  These uninspected 
containers are considered to be a high trafficking threat. 
Narcotics also are shipped out of Argentina using  commercial 
aircraft, and in some cases, by cruise ship passengers. 
Couriers of cocaine from Argentina are primarily destined for 
Europe.  Couriers of heroin are primarily destined for the 
United States. 
 
15.  Demand Reduction Programs.  SEDRONAR is charged with 
coordinating the GOA,s demand reduction efforts and in 
December the newly-appointed head of SEDRONAR directed his 
staff to develop a comprehensive demand reduction plan 
focusing on youth education and public awareness.  Drug use 
is treated as a medical problem and addicts are eligible to 
receive federal government-subsidized treatment.  Buenos 
Aires province, the most heavily populated province and also 
the one with the largest number of regular drug users, has 
its own well-established demand reduction program. 
IV.  U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
16.  Policy Initiatives.  The September 2004 signing of the 
LOA has allowed Post to receive an INL budget for the first 
time since 1995 and begin providing much needed training and 
assistance.  However, as Argentina remains under Brooke 
Amendment Sanctions for failure to make payments on a 
bilateral loan, this may affect Post\'s ability to provide 
assistance.  As mentioned above, the GOA is embarking on the 
creation of both a national security plan focusing on 
narcotics interdiction and a national drug prevention plan. 
The GOA has asked for Post,s input and assistance with both 
plans. 
 
17.  Cooperation between the USG and Argentine authorities, 
both federal and provincial, continued to be excellent in 
2004.  During 2004, USG assistance supplied a wealth of 
equipment and training programs for Argentine law enforcement 
personnel.  Examples of USG-funded programs in 2004 include: 
Two law enforcement tactical training courses provided by 
DEA;  a money laundering course sponsored by the Department 
of Homeland Security (ICE);  an airport narcotics 
interdiction course sponsored by DEA/INL;  and a prevention 
seminar held in conjunction with SEDRONAR sponsored by PAS 
and INL.  DEA/INL also sponsored several GOA law enforcement 
professionals, participation in regional training programs. 
In addition to providing valuable training opportunities, 
Post,s DEA detachment supports the Northern Border Task 
Force (NBTF), Group Condor, and starting in 2004, the Mendoza 
Airport Task Force.  The DEA-supported task forces 
demonstrate the benefits of interagency cooperation, and GOA 
officials have expressed interest in expanding the program to 
develop task forces in other narcotics trafficking hot spots. 
 
18.  The Road Ahead.  The GOA is taking concrete steps to 
combat both narcotrafficking and drug use, and Post will 
continue to assist and encourage the GOA in this process. 
The signing of the LOA has created a window of opportunity 
for even greater cooperation, and Post will diligently seek 
out still more opportunities to constructively engage the GOA 
on narcotics issues.  Possible areas of further cooperation 
include expanding the task force program to include the 
creation of a Tri-border task force in the province of 
Misiones and a Port of Buenos Aires task force to control 
narcotics trafficking between Buenos Aires and Uruguay.  Post 
will also continue encouraging the GOA to work toward 
improving its radar system in the border area.

 1.  (C) Ambassador Gutierrez met December 23 with Argentine 
Foreign Minister Rafael Bielsa to raise again our concerns 
about recent events in Venezuela.  The Ambassador began by 
noting that in his meeting with Secretary Powell, Bielsa had 
stated that President Kirchner and the GOA would use every 
opportunity to engage with President Chavez on human rights, 
democracy and governance issues.  The Ambassador then took 
Bielsa through the issues raised in Reftel A, namely, the new 
law on media content; the packing of the Venezuelan Supreme 
Court; the draft law that would criminalize the use of 
foreign funding by Venezuelan human rights and civil society 
NGOs; the criminal case against the leaders of the NGO 
Sumate; and finally, the need for Venezuela to work 
cooperatively with Colombia to secure their shared border. 
 
2.  (C) Bielsa responded first to the border security issue 
stating that at the Cuzco Summit earlier this month, 
Colombian President Uribe had specifically praised Chavez for 
his cooperation on border security.  Bielsa said he thought 
things were \"going better\" on this count.  On the other 
issues, Bielsa thanked the Ambassador for our comments and 
concerns and said he would further investigage each of them. 
He felt, however, that there was little the GOA could do with 
the recently passed media law and the Supreme Court 
appointments as these were now accomplished \"judicial\" facts. 
 He thought there might be more room for maneuver on the 
draft law on NGO funding and the pending Sumate case.  He 
promised to look closely at these cases and to raise these 
issues with President Kirchner for his possible discussion 
with Chavez. 
 
3.  (C) As he was leaving, the Ambassador congratulated 
Bielsa for his efforts on behalf of Cuban dissident Hilda 
Molina (reftels).  Bielsa, who according to some press 
accounts was in danger of being fired by President Kirchner, 
thanked the Ambassador and said supporting Molina\'s request 
to visit her son and his family was \"the right thing to do.\" 
When the Ambassador noted that human rights was something 
that cannot be applied selectively, Bielsa concurred adding 
\"we\'ll see how much more President Kirchner can bear.\"

 1. (C)  Summary:  Ambassador Gutierrez and the Embassy 
Buenos Aires country team warmly welcome CODEL Dodd to 
Argentina January 12-13.  During your stay in Argentina you 
will have the opportunity to speak with senior Argentine 
officials and experts on a range of political, economic and 
counternarcotics issues.  Your visit comes at the beginning 
of a year in which Argentina will seek to consolidate its 
impressive economic and political recovery from the 2001-2002 
crisis.  Indeed, during your visit, Argentina will launch its 
long-awaited restructuring of over USD 81 billion of private 
debt following the largest sovereign default in history.  A 
successful debt restructuring will be a key component in 
reintegrating Argentina into world capital markets.  On the 
political front, President Kirchner, while maintaining 
remarkably high approval ratings, will be looking to 
consolidate his own position within the ruling Peronist party 
as the country faces legislative elections in October.  On 
counternarcotics issues, our cooperation with Argentine 
authorities, both federal and provincial, is excellent.  In 
September 2004, following ten years of negotiations, the GOA 
signed a Letter of Agreement with the Department of State, 
both demonstrating its increased willingness to work with the 
U.S. on counternarcotics issues, and enabling the U.S. to 
begin providing assistance to the GOA.  End Summary. 
 
Overall Political Scene 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C)  Your visit comes as President Nestor Kirchner is 
enjoying a good run politically and economically.  Argentina 
has made a steady recovery from its catastrophic economic and 
political meltdown at the end of 2001 and early 2002.  Since 
taking office, Kirchner has focused on consolidating his 
political strength from the 22 percent popular vote he 
received in national elections April 27, 2003.  He forced 
changes in the Supreme Court, the military, and his own 
ruling Peronist (PJ) party and undertook populist measures 
such as seeking to raise the lowest government salaries, the 
minimum wage, and government pensions.  In mid-2004, however, 
Kirchner,s high approval ratings were showing some decline 
because of concerns over crime and public security.  The 
spectacular rescue in October of a high-profile kidnapping 
victim by Buenos Aires police has helped counter the 
perception that Kirchner\'s government has not done enough to 
deal with crime, including a wave of kidnappings that have 
included wealthy, middle, and working class families. 
Kirchner is also helped immeasurably by the absence of real 
political opposition.  The PJ party controls 51 percent of 
the seats in the House and 57 percent in the Senate and 16 of 
the 24 governorships.  The next largest party, the Radicals 
(UCR), controls less than 20 percent in each chamber.  Forty 
other political parties, many of them one-man shows, round 
out the political scene. 
 
Economy 
------- 
 
3. (U)  Argentina\'s economic recovery since late 2002 has 
been impressive.  An export-led boom triggered an 8.7 percent 
surge in real GDP in 2003 and an estimated growth of 8.2 
percent in 2004.  Unemployment declined to 13.5 percent in 
2004.  Investment has jumped and capital flight has 
decreased.  Argentina\'s robust economic recovery is the 
result of market reforms in the 1990s, including very high 
investment, the adoption of a market-based exchange rate 
regime in early 2002, and a favorable combination of high 
international commodity prices and low interest rates. 
Argentina has sound economic fundamentals and should continue 
to perform well in 2005, assuming a successful debt 
restructuring attracts international and domestic investment. 
 Argentina needs to sustain a high rate of investment and 
growth to deal with its high poverty rate.  During the first 
half of 2004, 44 percent of the population were living below 
the poverty line, and 17 percent were considered destitute. 
 
Foreign Relations 
----------------- 
 
4. (C)  Argentina has played a generally positive role in 
promoting human rights and democratic institutions in the 
hemisphere, particularly in Haiti and Bolivia.  Along with a 
number of its neighbors, Argentina currently has peacekeeping 
forces (almost 600) in Haiti in support of MINUSTAH, 
reflecting its traditionally strong support of UN 
peacekeeping operations.  In Venezuela, President Kirchner 
also played a constructive role in pressing Chavez to hold a 
recall referendum in 2004.  This month Argentina assumed a 
two-year seat on the UN Security Council.  In November 2005, 
Argentina will host the hemisphere\'s leaders at the next 
Summit of the Americas. 
 
Counternarcotics Cooperation 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (U)  Argentina is not a major drug producing country, but 
it is a transit country for cocaine flowing from neighboring 
Bolivia, Peru and Columbia primarily destined for Europe. 
Argentina is also a transit route for Colombian heroin en 
route to the U.S. east coast (primarily New York).  Due to 
its advanced chemical production facilities, Argentina 
continues to be a source for precursor chemicals.  According 
to Argentine government statistics, there was more cocaine 
seized in the first three quarters of 2004 than in the entire 
2003 calendar year.  In addition to Argentine traffickers, 
there is evidence that Colombian drug traffickers have 
greatly increased their presence in all aspects of the 
Argentine drug trade.  This may signal a new chapter in the 
global war on drugs, as Colombian narcotics traffickers 
search out alternative bases of operations and transit routes 
in response to the increased pressure of Plan Colombia. 
 
6. (U)  The September 2004 signing of the Letter of Agreement 
has allowed the Embassy to receive an INL budget for the 
first time since 1995 and begin providing much needed 
training and assistance.  However,the fact that Argentina 
remains under Brooke Amendment Sanctions for failure to make 
payments on a bilateral loan may affect Post\'s ability to 
provide assistance.  The GOA is embarking on the creation of 
both a national security plan focusing on narcotics 
interdiction and a national drug prevention plan.  The GOA 
has asked for Post,s input and assistance with both plans. 
 
7. (U)  Cooperation between the USG and Argentine 
authorities, both federal and provincial, continued to be 
excellent in 2004.  During 2004, USG assistance supplied both 
equipment and training programs for Argentine law enforcement 
personnel.  Examples of USG-funded programs in 2004 include: 
two law enforcement tactical training courses provided by 
DEA; a money laundering course sponsored by the Department of 
Homeland Security (ICE); an airport narcotics interdiction 
course sponsored by DEA/INL; and a prevention seminar held in 
conjunction with SEDRONAR sponsored by PAS and INL.  DEA/INL 
also sponsored several GOA law enforcement professionals, 
participation in regional training programs.  In addition to 
providing valuable training opportunities, Post,s DEA 
detachment supports the Northern Border Task Force (NBTF), 
and starting in 2004, the Mendoza Airport Task Force.  The 
DEA-supported task forces demonstrate the benefits of 
interagency cooperation, and GOA officials have expressed 
interest in expanding the program to develop task forces in 
other narcotics trafficking hot spots.
