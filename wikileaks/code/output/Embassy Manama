SUBJECT:  AMIR TO SECRETARY POWELL ON AFGHANISTAN\'S 
          FUTURE: GET A GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND 
 
REF:  A) STATE 187567     B) MANAMA 3624 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD E. NEUMANN.  REASONS 
1.5 (B)(D) 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY. BAHRAIN\'S AMIR WELCOMES THE U.S. FOCUS 
ON REPLACING THE TALIBAN AND FORMING A BROAD-BASED 
GOVERNMENT.  HE URGED THAT WE GET SOME FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND QUICKLY TO BECOME A LEGITIMATE 
SPOKESMAN FOR AFGHANISTAN AND TURN THE TALIBAN INTO 
INSURGENTS.  WITH SUCH A STEP HE THINKS THE LENGTH OF 
THE WAR WILL BECOME LESS IMPORTANT, AND WITHOUT IT THE 
PUBLIC PROBLEM WILL GROW.  HIS PS: CAN\'T YOU DO 
SOMETHING ON PULLING THE PLUG ON AL JAZEERA? WE DO NOT 
RECOMMEND THIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (S) DURING THE CALL BY SECRETARY OF THE NAVY GORDON 
ENGLAND ON BAHRAIN\'S AMIR SHAIKH HAMAD BIN ISA OCTOBER 
29, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED SECRETARY POWELL\'S ORAL 
MESSAGE ON AFGHANISTAN (REFTEL A).  THE AMIR AGREED WITH 
THE THRUST OF CREATING A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT KEEPING 
THE UN IN THE LEAD ON ASSISTANCE, AND THE REMOVAL OF THE 
TALIBAN (\"ESSENTIAL\").  HOWEVER, THE AMIR FOCUSED HIS 
ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO MOVE SPEEDILY TO PUT AN AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND.  HE MADE CLEAR THAT IT IS THE 
SYMBOLISM AND NOT THE REALITY OF CONTROL THAT HE 
BELIEVES IS ESSENTIAL. 
 
3.  (S) HIS RECOMMENDATION IS, ESSENTIALLY, TO GET AS 
BROAD BASED A GROUP AS POSSIBLE, AND GET THEM ON TO THE 
GROUND, AND CALL THEM A GOVERNMENT.  HE DOES NOT BELIEVE 
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY BE IN KABUL.  THEY COULD BE 
CLOSE TO THE BORDER AND DEALING WITH REFUGEE ISSUES. 
ALTERNATIVELY, THEY COULD BE IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF IF THE 
TOWN CAN BE SEIZED.  THE AMIR\'S POINT IS THAT ONCE A 
GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT CAN BEGIN TO 
SPEAK FROM THE SOIL OF AFGHANISTAN THEY CAN RAPIDLY TAKE 
ON THE MANTLE OF AUTHORITY, AND PUSH THE TALIBAN INTO 
THE ROLE OF INSURGENTS FIGHTING IN THE HILLS.  THIS WILL 
ALLOW A COUNTERPOINT TO THE POPULAR VIEW THAT THE U.S. 
IS WAGING WAR ON, RATHER THAN TO LIBERATE AFGHANISTAN. 
 
4. (S) SUBSIDIARY POINTS MADE BY THE AMIR INCLUDED THE 
NEED TO PROTECT THE NEW GOVERNMENT WITH ISLAMIC, NOT 
U.S. FORCES, AND THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SITES FOR 
DISCUSSING AND LAUNCHING SUCH A GOVERNMENT INCLUDE 
CONSIDERATION OF SAUDI ARABIA, PREFERABLY MECCA, TO GIVE 
IT A HOLY CAST.  HE THOUGHT TURKEY, AND PERHAPS, 
PAKISTAN WOULD BE HELPFUL. 
 
5.  (S) THE AMIR ALSO LAID INTO AL JAZEERA WITH EVEN 
MORE THAN HIS USUAL GUSTO.  HE DECLAIMED AT LENGTH ON 
HOW DANGEROUS THIS STATION IS, HOW IT IS ESSENTIALLY 
ONE-SIDED PROPAGANDA, AND ALLEGED THAT THE AL JAZEERA 
CORRESPONDENT IN KABUL (HE WAS SOME UNCERTAIN HERE, IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN KANDAHAR) IS ACTUALLY NOT A JOURNALIST, 
BUT AN \"AFGHAN ARAB.\"  HIS BASIC THRUST WAS TO ASK 
WHETHER THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA COULD NOT 
SOMEHOW PULL THE PLUG OF ARABSAT AND MAKE AL JAZEERA 
OCCASIONALLY DISAPPEAR FROM THE AIRWAVES. 
 
6.  (S)  COMMENT:  THE AMIR IS FIXATED WITH THE NEED TO 
SHOW POLITICAL MOVEMENT ON THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN. 
THE FIXATION IS AN ACTION-ORIENTED MANIFESTATION OF THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC FRUSTRATION THAT THE BOMBING IS NOT BEING 
LINKED, IN WAYS THEY CAN SEE, TO AN ARTICULATED 
POLITICAL STRATEGY EXTENDING BEYOND ANTI-TERRORISM.  THE 
AMIR AND THE PUBLIC HERE WANT TO KNOW ALSO THE 
CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD SHAPE AN END TO THE CURRENT PHASE 
OF THE WAR.  IN THE ABSENCE OF BENCHMARKS TOWARDS WHICH 
WE CAN BE SEEN TO BE PROCEEDING, THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.  AS TO AL JAZEERA, 
THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE BAHRAINIS AND THE 
QATARIS AND THE GOB HAS NEVER FELT MORE THAN CORDIAL 
DISTASTE FOR AL JAZEERA, EVEN AT THE BEST OF TIMES.  WE 
WATCH AL-JAZEERA REGULARLY.  SOME OF THE COVERAGE -- BUT 
NOT ALL -- IS BIASED.  BUT WHAT IS HURTING US BADLY IS 
THE VISUALS, WOUNDED CIVILIANS AND DESPERATE REFUGEES, 
NOT THE COMMENTARY.  IF AL JAZEERA WAS TURNED OFF, WE 
SUSPECT ITS POPULARITY WOULD SIMPLY PASS TO THE EVEN 
WORSE HIZBALLAH SATELLITE STATION AL MANAR, WHICH IS 
ALSO BROADCASTING CURRENTLY FROM AFGHANISTAN. FINALLY, 
ASSAULTING THE MEDIA WOULD DAMAGE OUR OWN CREDIBILITY. 
IN SHORT, WE ARE REPORTING THIS VIEW, NOT ADVOCATING IT.

1.  (C)  I discussed with Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammed 
bin Mubarak on December 31 the possibility of Bahrain\'s 
completing the Article 98 Agreement through a secret exchange 
of notes rather than by parliamentary ratification.  Although 
Bahrain\'s foreign ministry has consistently said ratification 
was necessary. I took Shaikh Mohammed through our practice of 
executive agreements as an alternative to treaties.  I 
pointed out that we often have confidential agreements of 
this type.  I also updated him on the number of countries 
with whom we have signed Article 98 agreements.  Drawing on 
ref conversation and e-mail I noted Moroccan and Egyptian 
progress. 
 
2.  (C)  Shaikh Mohammed was interested in the idea of an 
executive agreement that could be kept confidential. He asked 
his private secretary to work with the legal department to 
see if this could be done.  This was not a firm commitment, 
but we will go back in a week or two and see to what 
conclusions they have come.

SUBJECT: NDI TACKLES THE 2002 CONSTITUTION 
 
 
Classified By: ADCM Gregory N. Hicks for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U)  SUMMARY: Despite a last minute Al Wifaq political 
society boycott, 90 Bahraini politicians, including an Al 
Wifaq elected official, attended an NDI seminar on the 
legislative authority in the 2002 Constitution.  NDI 
representative Fawzi Guleid argued that the 2002 Constitution 
provides ample legislative authority to the National Assembly 
if members wish to exercise it.  He asserted that members 
have the right to draft legislation and noted that they may 
approve, reject, or amend government proposed bills. 
Opposition participants rejected Guleid\'s position on the 
basis that the 2002 Constitution is illegitimate, but others 
supported Guleid\'s view.  Overall, the seminar was a success 
for promoting the growth of Bahrain\'s democracy. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  On December 9, the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) in cooperation with Al Minbar National Islamic Society 
organized a seminar to discuss the legislative power of the 
Bahraini Constitution.  In the two weeks leading up to the 
seminar, there was \'talk\' that Al Wifaq was dissatisfied with 
the seminar topic.  NDI Program Manager Fawzi Guleid heard 
from various members of the other opposition parties that Al 
Wifaq was thinking of boycotting the event.  One of Al 
Wifaq\'s long-standing criticisms of the GOB is that Bahrain\'s 
Constitution is illegitimate and that Bahrain remains in the 
quagmire of a constitutional crisis.  Guleid expressed his 
nervousness to PolOff about the possibility of Al Wifaq not 
attending the seminar. He was concerned that the five other 
opposition parties would side with Al Wifaq and no one would 
attend.  Guleid told PolOff that three phone calls with Al 
Wifaq\'s President Ali Salman bore no indication of whether 
the rumors about boycotting the event were true.  But the day 
before the seminar, Al Wifaq leadership announced they would 
not attend.  Nonetheless, 90 participants out of 120 
respondents attended, including National Assembly members, 
Municipal Council members, prominent politicians, members of 
various opposition parties, including a prominent Al Wifaq 
Municipal Counselor Murtadha Bader.   (COMMENT: This seminar 
is one of the rare occasions when the six \'boycotting 
societies\' did not act as a unified group, a sign that most 
of those societies which boycotted the 2002 elections may be 
looking forward to participating in the future.  END 
COMMENT.)  The seminar was organized into two groups of 
presentations followed by question and answer sessions open 
to the floor.  NDI promised to revisit the topic in the 
future by hosting two or three follow-up brain storming 
sessions. 
 
3. (U)  Under the session entitled, \"The Actual Jurisdiction 
of the Legislative Authority in Bahrain,8 President of Al 
Minbar National Islamic Society and COR member, Dr. Salah Ali 
opened the seminar with a presentation on the system of both 
COR and Shura Council parliamentary operation within the 
articles of the Constitution.  Attorney and Al Minbar Board 
member Shaikh Issa Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa noted the 
existence within Bahrain of three major political 
orientations, one of which supports the legislative 
authority\'s jurisdiction stipulated in the 2002 Constitution, 
a second which refuses to recognize the legislative body on 
the grounds that the 2002 Constitution is illegitimate, and a 
third new wave which accepts the current situation as a 
foundation that can be improved. 
 
4.  (U)  COR\'s legal Advisor, Ammro Foad Barakat discussed 
the importance of a thorough reading and understanding of the 
Constitution and the bylaws.  He outlined details and rules 
of procedure concerning both the Representative and Shura 
Councils.  This was followed by Attorney and Advisor at the 
Department of Legal Affairs, Mal Allah Jaafer Al Hammadi 
explained the basic principles of drafting legislation. 
Shaikh Issa presented a paper on the parliamentary process 
for both Shura and COR as presented in the Constitution. 
 
5.  (U)  Guleid concluded the seminar by facilitating a 
brainstorming session on the role and authority of the 
legislative authority as stipulated in the National Charter, 
Constitution, and National Assembly Bylaws. He reminded the 
participants that there are many ways to interpret the 
Constitution; \"It is not black and white,\" he said. The 
Constitution is written with legislative participation and 
power distributed in a way that avoids clashes between the 
Cabinet and the Legislators.  The King and the Cabinet are 
not the only drivers of the legislative process.  Members 
have the power to introduce legislation.  Guleid noted that 
the Bahraini Constitution issued on 14 February 2002 and the 
bylaws presented by the government limited the jurisdiction 
of the National Council.  He stated that executive control 
currently exercised over the legislative process may violate 
articles 56 and 93 of the Constitution.    Article 92 of the 
Constitution allows 15 members of the Shura or the COR to 
propose an amendment to the Constitution.  Article 92 also 
allows any member of the two chambers to propose laws.  Along 
with articles 81 and 104(c), Guleid underscored that the 
Shura and the COR have the right to prepare or draft 
legislation without referring them to any government entity 
and if the Prime Minister presents a bill, the chambers have 
the right to pass, amend or reject it. 
 
------------------------------------- 
The Opportunity to Agree and Disagree 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Most questions and comments focused on Shaikh Issa\'s 
Third Wave argument of accepting the current Constitution and 
moving forward.  Writer and Founder of the Gulf Academy for 
Development and Human Resources Taqi Al Zeera urged that the 
National Charter, while drafted by the GOB and approved and 
accepted by the people, must now offer realistic solutions. 
Former President of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights BCHR) 
Aziz Abul disagreed arguing that the core issue is still the 
validity of the 2002 Constitution, which was passed 
individually by the King, but not approved by the people. 
Fifty percent of the people rejected the constitution, he 
asserted. (NOTE:  The boycotting opposition societies turned 
the 2002 election into a referendum on the constitution. 
Turnout in the election was 53%, a victory by any democratic 
standard for the King and Constitution.   END NOTE.)  Member 
of the National Action Society, Dr. Abdul Nabi Al Ekri echoed 
his sentiments and said that, \"Fifty percent of the 
boycotting societies do not reject the reform process or 
development, but rather the 2002 constitution.  COR member 
Municipal Council member Murtadha Bader and member of the 
boycotting Al Wifaq Society, anticipated a drop in 
participation in the 2006 election, due to what he described 
as &slow as a turtle8 progress of the representative 
council and &backward8 laws.  Other participants noted that 
the parliamentary experience would have been in better shape 
had the boycotting societies, many of which are very 
experienced, participated. 
 
7. (U)  COMMENT:  The outstanding reputation of NDI\'s 
programs and the influence it has on opposition society 
members, NGOs, the Municipal Council, the Shura and the COR 
made Al Wifaq\'s last minute boycott of the seminar a 
non-issue.  Five boycotting societies and even members of Al 
Wifaq attended. The seminar demonstrated many opportunities 
for political activists to make the existing system work and 
represents another NDI success for promoting democracy in 
Bahrain.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR USDOC ASSISTANT SECRETARY LASH 
VISIT TO BAHRAIN 
 
REF: USDOC 6511 
 
1.  Our team at Embassy Manama welcomes the upcoming visit of 
Assistant Secretary Lash to Bahrain.  I regret that I will 
not be here to meet you, but we are arranging an excellent 
program in my absence.  Your visit will further strengthen 
ties between the Commerce Department and Bahrain, building 
the recent visit by Secretary Evans and Deputy Secretary 
Bodman last October and Deputy Secretary Bodman\'s visit in 
March 2002.  The Bahrainis want closer economic relations and 
want also to expand regional trade.  Your visit will be very 
welcome. 
 
2.  Overall U.S.-Bahraini relations are excellent.  Our 
security relationship, centered around the longstanding U.S. 
Navy\'s presence in Bahrain, is the cornerstone of our 
bilateral relationship.  In addition, through the Middle East 
Partnership Initiative we are engaging with nascent 
democratic and civil society institutions, including 
Bahrain\'s new Parliament.  We also are funding ABA work with 
the Bahrainis on commercial law reform. 
 
3.  More and more we are focusing on the bilateral economic 
relationship.  The U.S. is Bahrain\'s largest trading partner. 
 Our exports to Bahrain in 2003 were approximately $330 
million; we imported approximately $456 million of Bahraini 
products as well -- textiles, aluminum, and petrochemicals. 
U.S. companies with subsidiary operations in Bahrain include 
American Express, Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chevron, 
and Great Lakes Dredging. 
 
4.  In dollar terms, however, trade has been growing only 
slowly.  The Bahraini Government recognizes that enhanced 
trade flows are a means of addressing its serious 
unemployment problem.  For that reason the King and the Crown 
Prince seek a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United 
States.  Under USTR leadership, the FTA negotiations will 
begin here on January 26.  We anticipate that textiles and 
services will be the toughest issues in the negotiations. 
 
5.  The Bahraini Government and business sector, meanwhile, 
are keenly interested in developments in Iraq.  The 
Government is anxious to see Iraq stabilized and friendly 
with its neighbors.  The Bahraini business sector has hoped 
that with the end of the war and the reconstruction of Iraq 
there would be many new business opportunities.  So far, 
Bahrain companies\' experience has not been positive.  One of 
Bahrain\'s flagship companies, telephone service provider 
BATELCO, was not successful in its bid for a GSM operating 
license in Iraq.  Another flagship company, Gulf Airlines, 
still awaits the reopening of airports in Baghdad and Basra. 
Other Bahraini firms, including construction firms and 
trading companies, hope for new contract opportunities.  You 
will be able to address these kinds of opportunities during 
your meeting with the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and also 
during your meeting with the Bahraini press. 
 
6.  Finally, we would like you to give us a hand with the 
establishment of the new American Chamber of Commerce in 
Bahrain (AmCham).  For years there was an existing group of 
American businessmen in Bahrain, but it excluded non-American 
citizens -- thus leaving important American company 
subsidiaries such as Citibank, Federal Express, and American 
Express without representation in this group.  A different 
group is now organizing a formal American Chamber of Commerce 
in Bahrain.  King Hamad and Crown Prince Salman are 
enthusiastic about the AmCham concept.  A number of American 
companies have been invited to the reception we are giving in 
your honor on January 13th and we would appreciate your 
encouraging them to link up with the new AmCham. 
 
7.  Again, we look forward to seeing you in Bahrain.

NEW YEAR\'S EVE RIOT REPEAT 
 
REF: 03 MANAMA 0059 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  RSO has obtained details from senior GOB 
Interior Ministry (MOI) officials on how the Ministry 
planned, prepared for, and executed a major police deployment 
in Bahrain to prevent a repeat of last year\'s New Year\'s eve 
riots.  The MOI\'s preparations were impressive and 
demonstrated clear progress in the MOI\'s capability to 
provide security to major events.  The MOI\'s drawing on 
lessons learned from ATA training is also a clear testimonial 
to the value of the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  BACKGROUND CONTEXT:  On New Year\'s Eve, 31 DEC 
2002, Bahrain was rocked by spontaneous, violent, and 
damaging, albeit relatively disorganized, riots that 
destroyed over 100 cars, caused more than USD 250,000 total 
damage in area hotels, and left the country shaken, confused, 
and in search of a motive and organizer (RefTel).  Various 
Embassy contacts offered a range of hypotheses on the 
composition and motivations of the rioters from \"saboteurs,\" 
committing \"deliberate acts\" intended to \"create chaos and 
instability, provoke the police, and undermine the country\'s 
stability and achievements,\" to laying blame on the numerous 
Shi\'a political societies.  Some asserted that most of the 
rioters were opportunist hooligans who capitalized on an 
event that spun out of control.  At any rate, the riots stung 
the Interior Ministry, humiliating their law enforcement 
efforts, and undermined the credibility of an already 
oft-maligned government department.  END BACKGROUND CONTEXT 
 
3.  (SBU)  On Wednesday, 01/07/04, Asst. RSO spent an hour 
with Colonel Ibrahim Al Ghaith, Director of the \"Training and 
Guards Directorate.\"  Col Al Ghaith put together the MOI New 
Year\'s Eve 2003 plan, implemented it under the authority of 
the MOI Undersecretary, MajGen Daij Khalifa Daij Al Khalifa, 
and briefed it to Asst. RSO as follows. 
 
4. (SBU)  Several weeks before the event, Col Al Ghaith met 
with an entire working shift (about 450 policemen) from the 
various police sub-stations around Bahrain.  The purpose of 
this meeting was to ascertain, from the viewpoint of the 
\"street-level\" patrolmen, where problems were anticipated and 
what the policemen recommended as appropriate countermeasures 
thereto.  The policemen recommended robust foot patrols in 
the areas of Exhibition Avenue, downtown Manama, the Bahrain 
Exhibition Center, and Gudaibya.  They further requested that 
patrols consist of two officers each. 
 
5. (SBU)  Col Al Ghaith explained that, upon reflection, he 
preferred patrols consisting of 5 officers each.  These 
patrols were deployed in the aforementioned areas.  Further, 
each patrol of 5 policemen was comprised of 1 policeman from 
the cognizant sub-station supplemented by 4 policemen from 
the \"Guards\" Directorate.  This way, the leader of the patrol 
was highly familiar with the area, plus he had a capable team 
under him.  On the ground, they utilized dispersion by 
breaking each 5-man patrol into two smaller groups of 2/3 and 
separated them by a half-block.  They worked together, but 
did not cluster too closely. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Each of these foot patrols was assigned an area of 
responsibility.  Multiple teams covering the larger 
jurisdiction would report to a high-level officer resident at 
the cognizant sub-station, who then reported to the MOI\'s 
Command Center at the Fort (HQ). 
 
7.  (SBU)  Special Security Force Directorate (SSFD, the 
Directorate that provides the riot police/tactical teams) 
pre-positioned a react force at the Manama, Gudaibya, and 
Exhibition Center police stations and two at the Fort.  These 
teams were on standby to react to an incident beyond the 
capabilities of the above-mentioned foot patrol teams.  The 
chain of command and communications worked like this:  The 
foot patrol leader would call the OIC at the sub-station, who 
would call the Command Center at the Fort.  The Command 
Center would deploy the React Forces as needed. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Col Al Ghaith and his counterparts ran the Command 
Center and remained there all night.  The Undersecretary was 
in charge overall. 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT:  Of note, this demonstrates the benefits of 
Post\'s robust ATA training agenda.  Senior police officials 
solicited input from lower ranks with ground-level knowledge, 
developed a cohesive plan, and then effectively executed this 
plan.  Through pre-event publicity and advertising, meetings 
and discussions with various political society leaders, a 
well-organized force, and sound Command, Control, and 
Communications, the effort was by all accounts a success. 
The MOI officers are clearly learning these skills, in large 
part, through the various ATA courses.  Col Al Ghaith added 
that this plan and methodology will be the model for future 
coverage of large/special events.  This is good news for the 
future.  Col Al Ghaith is completely sold on ATA and the 
modern method of assessing a task and accomplishing a 
mission.  He is a strong contact for the RSO office and, as 
we have come to learn from his superiors, one of the future 
leaders of the MOI.  He has already been identified for the 
senior-level echelons in the near future.  END COMMENT

(U) This message contains SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION.  Please protect accordingly.  NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
1.(SBU) U.S. insurance giant American International Group 
(AIG) is concerned that Bahrain\'s draft insurance law, 
announced yesterday by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) 
Governor, could seriously infringe its competitiveness in 
Bahrain, local AIG Group Manager Ghalib Hammoudi told 
POL/ECON Chief on January 20.  Hammoudi said the law does not 
authorize the existence of insurance agencies, only brokers 
and companies.  He stated that AIG has submitted to the BMA 
suggested amendments to the draft law that would authorize 
insurance agencies, but the BMA has not provided any feedback 
to the message.  AIG has operated successfully in Bahrain as 
an agency since 1960, when ALICO issued the first insurance 
policy on the island, Hammoudi proudly related. 
 
2.(SBU) Hammoudi also briefed that in 2003, the BMA refused 
to allow AIG to activate ALICO\'s property casualty license on 
behalf of AIG daughter company American Insurance 
Underwriters (AIU).  Hammoudi said that when AIG protested 
the BMA\'s decision, the BMA agreed to reconsider, but it has 
yet to provide AIG with a response. 
 
3.(SBU) AIG and the GOB have a previous dispute.  In 2001, 
the Government ordered ALICO to pay the 10% company social 
insurance levy to GOSI, Bahrain\'s financially troubled social 
insurance organization, for its commission insurance agents. 
ALICO sued the government and initially won its case that 
commission agents are independent businessmen, not employees. 
 However, the government substituted a different judge into 
the court, and he reversed the previous ruling.  At the time, 
the Embassy offered to intervene, but local ALICO officials 
never took up the offer.  In May 2003, the company paid GOSI 
USD 1 million to settle accounts, and it is currently paying 
the social insurance levy for its agents. 
 
4.(SBU) COMMENT:  Embassy has requested a copy of the draft 
insurance law to pass to U.S. FTA Financial Services 
negotiators.  While AIG has requested that we not raise its 
specific problems in the context of FTA negotiations, there 
may be enough here to address these issues on behalf of the 
entire U.S. insurance industry.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: KING HAMAD WANTS NO ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 014218 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN.  REASON:  1.4 (D). 
 
1.  (S)  KING HAMAD ON JANUARY 26, WARNED THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
SHIA POLITICAL ACTIVISM IN IRAQ COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO 
    ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE LIKE IRAN.  THE KING RECEIVED THE 
AMBASSADOR IN ADVANCE OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S DEPARTURE FOR A 
TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT IN BAGHDAD, AND THE KING USED THE 
OCCASION TO REVIEW HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN IRAQ. 
THE KING CONFIDED THAT HE HAS BEEN EXCHANGING MESSAGES WITH 
IRAQI AYATOLLAH SISTANI THROUGH A LESSER CLERIC IN NAJAF, 
HAJJATOLLAH GHUREIFI.  (COMMENT:  AL GHUREIFI IS KNOWN TO US 
BECAUSE HE HAS COUSINS AMONG THE BAHRAINI SHIA CLERGY; DCM 
MET AL GHUREIFI IN NAJAF WHERE GHUREIFI IS KNOWN AS THE 
\"BAHRAINI.\"  END COMMENT.) 
 
2.  (S)  ACCORDING TO KING HAMAD, IN HIS FIRST MESSAGE 
THROUGH GHUREIFI SISTANI EMPHASIZED HIS WORRIES ABOUT HIS 
PERSONAL SAFETY IN NAJAF.  HAMAD TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
HAMAD HAD URGED SISTANI TO STAY AWAY FROM POLITICAL ISSUES. 
THIS WOULD MINIMIZE PERSONAL RISKS TO THE AYATOLLAH WHILE 
ENABLING HIM TO PLAY HIS NATURAL ROLE AS A SOURCE OF 
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY (MARJA\'A) FOR THE SHIA IN COUNTRIES LIKE 
SAUDI ARABIA, IRAQ AND BAHRAIN.  HOWEVER, THE KING OBSERVED, 
GHUREIFI BROUGHT A NEW MESSAGE FROM SISTANI DURING GHUREIFI\'S 
VISIT TO BAHRAIN WITH IRAQ GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER MOHAMMAD 
BAHR AL-ALOUM TWO WEEKS AGO.  IN THIS MESSAGE, SISTANI 
REPORTEDLY TOLD THE KING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE 
AYATOLLAH TO AVOID ENGAGING IN POLITICS. 
 
3.  (S)  KING HAMAD SAID THAT A SHIA ISLAMIC STATE RESEMBLING 
IRAN WOULD BE \"A BIG PROBLEM\" FOR THE REST OF THE REGION.  HE 
READILY AGREED WITH THE COMMENT PROFFERED BY MINISTER OF 
STATE ABDUL GHAFFAR THAT IN IRAQ, AND OTHER ARAB STATES, 
THEOCRACY -- BUT NOT ISLAMIC RELIGION -- MUST BE SEPARATED 
FROM POLITICS. 

4.  (S)  THE KING AGAIN RAISED THE IDEA OF A \"VATICAN LIKE\" 
STATUS FOR NAJAF THAT WE ORIGINALLY HEARD WHEN AMBASSADOR 
BREMER VISITED.  THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT THE CENTER OF SHIA 
POLITICS WOULD HAVE A SMALL AREA IN WHICH IT IS SUPREME BUT 
NOT A PART OF IRAQI POLITICS.  KING HAMAD DID NOT SUGGEST HOW 
THIS IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  HAMAD WAS RELAXED TALKING ABOUT IRAQ, BUT 
WE ALSO SENSE VERY KEEN INTEREST ABOUT IRAQ FROM ALL OF OUR 
SENIOR BAHRAINI INTERLOCUTORS.  THE KING WAS MORE INTERESTED 
IN THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIENTATION OF THE IRAQI STATE THAN ITS 
FEDERAL SYSTEM DEBATE OUTLINED IN REFTEL.

SUBJECT:  DCM RETURNS FROM NAJAF AND ENGAGES BAHRAINI 
AUDIENCES ON IRAQ 
 
1.  To further post\'s goal of convincing Bahraini audiences 
about U.S. goals in Iraq, PAS Manama arranged tailored media 
events for DCM Ford, who recently returned to Bahrain from a 
three month rotation as the CPA Governorate Coordinator in 
Najaf.  Bahrain is a small island and many Embassy contacts 
knew the DCM was in Najaf.  They were curious about his 
experiences there.  Post took advantage of their interest by 
programming him with top media contacts.  He also visited 
political salons (majlises) to renew his acquaintances and 
highlight U.S. work in Iraq.  Notably, younger Bahrainis 
were keenly interested in first-hand observations of the 
changes in Iraq since the war.  (Comment:  These majlises 
are noticeably less hostile than they were last spring.  End 
Comment.) 
 
2.  Over an informal breakfast with the editors-in-chief of 
Bahrain\'s daily newspapers January 13, DCM spoke first-hand 
about the situation in Najaf.  He responded to pointed 
questions about the pace of reconstruction and the steps 
that need to be taken before the CPA hands over sovereignty 
to Iraqis in the summer.  He also highlighted opportunities 
for Bahraini businesses in rebuilding Iraq.  At a reception 
in the DCMR with Bahraini journalists and columnists January 
14, Ford responded to numerous questions, and considerable 
doubts, about the daily lives of Iraqis and U.S. hopes for a 
democratic Iraq. 
 
3.  Ford\'s outreach activities paid off.  \"Akhbar Al 
Khaleej,\" a daily Arabic newspaper which strongly opposed 
the war and continues to regularly question U.S. intentions 
in Iraq, finally carried a positive article on January 14. 
Its headline: \"The American Deputy Ambassador:  We are 
Committed to Hand Over a Democratic and Just Regime to the 
Iraqis.\"  The editor-in-chief thanked the PAO profusely for 
inviting him to \"chat\" with Ford, and he stressed that his 
newspaper is not \"anti-American\" and that he welcomes such 
dialogues.  Another leading Arabic daily, al-Wasat, carried 
on January 14 a prominent story on an inside page reporting 
DCM\'s remarks about the potential for Bahraini companies in 
Iraq and the progress CPA has made setting up more 
representative local government. 
 
4.  Comment:  First hand knowledge about Iraq, combined with 
Arabic language skills, made DCM a particularly effective 
interlocutor with Bahraini media and groups.  When our young 
Arab-American APAO returns from a five month rotation in 
Iraq next month, we plan to program him at the University of 
Bahrain and with youth groups.  Post recommends that other 
posts consider programming officers upon return from similar 
rotations in Iraq.

SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT FLEXES MUSCLE - INVESTIGATION INTO 
PENSION FUND IRREGULARITIES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Bahrain\'s first major parliamentary crisis 
has strengthened the Parliament but impressed only part of 
the electorate. After a recess the battle may resume.  We 
have pushed for and received assurances that the Parliament 
will continue.  End summary. 
 
2. (U)  Parliament\'s investigation into the alleged financial 
corruption of government-controlled pension funds has 
dominated Bahraini attention for the past three weeks. The 
initial findings of the investigation allege that the funds 
lost BD 750 million (USD 1.9 billion) in losses due to bad 
investments and financial and administrative mismanagement. 
The Parliamentary Investigative Committee demands that the 
GOB repay the lost funds, implement oversight and restructure 
the funds\' boards.  It also demands that the GOB make its 
actions immediate. 
 
3.  (C)  Despite some of GOB misgivings, the Prime Minister 
publicly agreed to endorse the Committee\'s recommendations. 
Political insiders speculate that the Prime Minister\'s quick 
and public response to accept whatever the Committee 
recommended was a ploy to end the investigation. Speaker of 
the House Khalifa Ahmed Dhaharani publicly cautioned on 
January 20 that any further investigation of these funds will 
lead to a back lash and a suspension of Parliament. One 
political insider told the Ambassador on January 21 that the 
Ministers of Information, Cabinet Affairs, and Parliamentary 
Affairs privately put Dhahrani up to it. 
 
4.  (C)  Parliament will not be suspended.  The Ambassador 
asked for and got assurances on this point from the Crown 
Prince and three key ministers.  The King, aware of the 
conversations, emphasized to the Ambassador the \"positive\" 
value of the struggle. 
 
5.  (C)  Even if the GOB formally accepts the 
recommendations, the Parliament may not halt its pursuit of 
government officials.  On January 26, Committee Chair Fareed 
Ghazi Rafee told PolOff that the only way Parliament will 
gain credibility with the people is to force a Minister to 
resign.  Political observers around town are telling us that 
Minister of Finance and National Economy Abdulla Saif is most 
at risk of getting the axe.  When Saif appeared before the 
Investigative Committee he was nervous and evaded answering 
questions, according to Press, NGO representatives and 
businessmen who attended the January 14 session.  They 
commented that the Committee\'s grilling of Saif was intense. 
The King told the Ambassador on January 26 that the 
investigation was not conducted in an ideal manner, but 
Parliament as an institution must be allowed to develop. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  The GOSI investigation is a step forward 
for Parliament in terms of developing a more accountable 
government system.  Open discussion of financial scandal in 
the GOB is a unique event in Bahrain\'s history.  Some Embassy 
sources consider the investigation to be an improvement in 
the democratic development of Bahrain, especially if the GOB 
swiftly carries out the Committee\'s recommendations. 
However, some still remain ambivalent to the whole 
proceedings.  At a January 22 majlis, young Shi,a men told 
DCM that the Parliamentary maneuvers were only theater.  The 
battle between the GOB and the Parliament continues, 
especially now with the Investigative Committee planning to 
delve deeper into the public pension fund losses. Notably, 
Minister Saif is caught in the crosshairs.  A Cabinet contact 
told the Ambassador that no one will ultimately save Minister 
Saif if the Parliament really wants to go after him. Even 
some business contacts hope he goes.  Saif\'s removal might 
ultimately slow our bilateral FTA negotiations. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  ENAGING YOUNGER BAHRAINIS WITH ROCK AND ROLL 
 
1.  PAS Manama engaged younger and more diverse 
Bahraini audiences by programming American rock `n\' 
roll band \"Circus Guy\" from January 14-18, 2004. 
Circus Guy\'s program included performing live on Radio 
Bahrain\'s popular weekend music and interview program, 
an acoustic performance for critically ill children and 
their families at a local hospital, and performing at 
the Bahrain Mall, where Bahraini and Saudi families and 
teenagers congregate on weekends.  Emboffs attending 
Circus Guy\'s performance at the Mall witnessed Saudi 
and Bahraini women in their black \"abbayas\" smiling and 
gently swaying to Elvis Presley along with their 
teenage sons and daughters.  The four-member group also 
performed jointly with young Bahraini musicians at 
popular jazz club \"Likwid\" and conducted an afternoon 
guitar workshop for young music students at the Bahrain 
Music Institute.  At \"Likwid,\" Circus Guy jammed with 
local Bahraini band \"Myoclonic Jerk\" fusing diverse 
musical styles and promoting mutual understanding with 
an audience in the early twenties.  All performances 
received good coverage in the Bahraini media. 
 
2.  Post recommends Circus Guy for similar programming 
in the region.  The musicians were perfect good-will 
ambassadors, impressive in their performances, warm and 
culturally sensitive with Bahraini contacts, adaptable 
and easy to program.  Since the musicians are in their 
twenties (and two are Iraqi-Americans), they related 
particularly well with youth and families.  The 
vocalist is currently studying at the American 
University in Cairo, and she sang several songs in 
Arabic, to the delight of audiences. 
 
3.  Post warmly thanks PAS Kuwait for identifying 
Circus Guy and offering to share them with neighboring 
posts, and especially for taking care of the mind 
boggling logistics related to getting four musicians, 
and their gear, to the Gulf.  We also appreciate the 
funding support provided by PAS Kuwait.  Due to the 
continuing resolution, we would not have been able to 
program Circus Guy without Kuwait\'s cost sharing.

REF: A. MANAMA 153 
 
     B. STATE 26772 
     C. MANAMA 149 
 
1. (SBU) Last week, Emb Manama (with assistance from the 
Department and CONGEN Dhahran) helped resolve two difficult 
children\'s issues (CI) cases involving disputes between Saudi 
fathers and Amcit mothers, with their dual-national children 
in between.  Both concluded successfully, but one was far 
more difficult than the other.  The lessons that we are 
drawing from the Al-Shalawi and Al-Balawi cases may be 
helpful should we and the Department confront similar cases 
again. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
LESSON 1:  USE THE SAME PASSPORT TO ENTER AND EXIT BAHRAIN 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (SBU).  In the Shalawi case, the mother had the Saudi 
passports for her and her six children when she went through 
exit controls at Bahrain International Airport.  Using the 
same passport for entry and exit allowed the immigration 
officer to verify by computer that she and her children 
entered Bahrain legally on the Saudi passport.  Their 
departure was unhindered.  Their US passports were necessary 
only to show the airline that they would be able to enter the 
US upon arrival. Above all, the mother\'s presence helped make 
the travel appear entirely routine. 
 
3. (SBU) In contrast, the four Al-Balawi children were 
traveling alone and on new US passports.  This raised GOB 
suspicions.  The new passports provided the Bahrainis with no 
entry record, which raised an immediate flag.  Moreover, a 
senior official in the MOI said that if an immigration 
officer suspects children traveling are subject to a child 
custody case, they are to check with their superiors.  The 
Balawis\' ran afoul on both counts quickly, pushing the 
decision to higher levels of the GOB and engaging the MFA. 
If the children had been able to carry their Saudi passport, 
they might have been able to leave Bahrain the same night 
they arrived at the Embassy. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
LESSON 2:  THE GOB LIVES FOR THE WEEKEND--REALLY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (SBU) The Al-Balawi children showed up on a Thursday 
night, the first day of the local weekend.  As the Embassy 
began addressing ever-higher levels of the GOB to get a quick 
decision--while trying to show as much sensitivity towards 
local mores as possible by avoiding calls during naptimes and 
meals--it became more and more apparent that the GOB, 
especially the Foreign Ministry, was positively hostile to 
being pressured into making a quick decision on a weekend. 
One high-level MFA official angrily told the Charge to \"stop 
calling all around town about this,\" while another told 
CONOFF that the USG was not helping its case by pushing so 
hard for a quick decision on a weekend. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
LESSON 3:  KEEP CI CASES IN THE INTERIOR MINISTRY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) For reasons that are still not entirely clear, the 
MFA appears to have been unhelpful in the case of the Al 
Balawis.  One very knowledgeable GOB source that that at a 
core Cabinet meeting on February 7, only the MFA argued 
against letting the Balawi children travel immediately.  In 
contrast, the upper echelons of the Ministry of Interior 
(MOI) were consistently in favor of letting the children 
travel.  We suspect that the MFA was more sensitive to the 
Saudi reaction than was the MOI--a sensitivity that led the 
MFA to commission a \"legal study\" of the issue.  (COMMENT: 
This \"study\" appears to have not been completed.  END 
COMMENT).  Given this sensitivity, resolving these types of 
cases through the MOI may be preferable. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
LESSON 4:  HAVE A CLEAR EXIT STRATEGY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) In the Al Shalawi case, Dhahran CONOFF was in 
regular communication with both Manama CONOFF and Mrs. Al 
Shalawi in the weeks prior to the event.  This communication 
allowed both CONOFFs to plan exactly what was needed for the 
Al Shalawis to depart.  In contrast, the Al Balawi children 
had no clear idea how they expected to leave Bahrain, and 
neither did their mother.  Without knowing more about exactly 
how, when, or with what documents the children would arrive 
at the Embassy, Post was not able to lay the groundwork for 
an easy departure, nor were we able to effectively allay the 
anxieties of the mother or children about what was going to 
happen. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
LESSON 5:  A LITTLE LUCK ALWAYS HELPS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The willingness of the Saudi father to allow the 
children to travel to their mother on a \"temporary visit\" was 
instrumental in the children receiving GOB permission to 
depart Bahrain for the US.  The father\'s consent gave the MFA 
the escape it was hoping for--it could placate the US without 
angering the Saudis.  However, this escape required a senior 
MFA official to explain (unconvincingly) to the Charge that 
it was illegal for someone to enter Bahrain on the passport 
of one nationality and depart using the passport of another 
nationality, but since the father did not object, it was OK 
for the children to leave using their US passports. 
(COMMENT:  A knowledgeable legal source looked at the 1965 
Bahraini Immigration Law and said that the law was silent on 
the issue of whether or not an alien had to enter and leave 
Bahrain using the same passport.  END COMMENT) 
 
8. (SBU) Our pressure certainly had the GOB looking for an 
escape, but if the father had reacted differently to what his 
wife told him, or if he believed that the children were still 
in Bahrain, the Al-Balawi children likely would still be in

REF: A. MANAMA 153 
     B. STATE 26772 
     C. MANAMA 149 
 
1. (SBU) Last week, Emb Manama (with assistance from the 
Department and CONGEN Dhahran) helped resolve two difficult 
children\'s issues (CI) cases involving disputes between Saudi 
fathers and Amcit mothers, with their dual-national children 
in between.  Both concluded successfully, but one was far 
more difficult than the other.  The lessons that we are 
drawing from the Al-Shalawi and Al-Balawi cases may be 
helpful should we and the Department confront similar cases 
again. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
LESSON 1:  USE THE SAME PASSPORT TO ENTER AND EXIT BAHRAIN 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (SBU).  In the Shalawi case, the mother had the Saudi 
passports for her and her six children when she went through 
exit controls at Bahrain International Airport.  Using the 
same passport for entry and exit allowed the immigration 
officer to verify by computer that she and her children 
entered Bahrain legally on the Saudi passport.  Their 
departure was unhindered.  Their US passports were necessary 
only to show the airline that they would be able to enter the 
US upon arrival. Above all, the mother\'s presence helped make 
the travel appear entirely routine. 
 
3. (SBU) In contrast, the four Al-Balawi children were 
traveling alone and on new US passports.  This raised GOB 
suspicions.  The new passports provided the Bahrainis with no 
entry record, which raised an immediate flag.  Moreover, a 
senior official in the MOI said that if an immigration 
officer suspects children traveling are subject to a child 
custody case, they are to check with their superiors.  The 
Balawis\' ran afoul on both counts quickly, pushing the 
decision to higher levels of the GOB and engaging the MFA. 
If the children had been able to carry their Saudi passport, 
they might have been able to leave Bahrain the same night 
they arrived at the Embassy. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
LESSON 2:  THE GOB LIVES FOR THE WEEKEND--REALLY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (SBU) The Al-Balawi children showed up on a Thursday 
night, the first day of the local weekend.  As the Embassy 
began addressing ever-higher levels of the GOB to get a quick 
decision--while trying to show as much sensitivity towards 
local mores as possible by avoiding calls during naptimes and 
meals--it became more and more apparent that the GOB, 
especially the Foreign Ministry, was positively hostile to 
being pressured into making a quick decision on a weekend. 
One high-level MFA official angrily told the Charge to \"stop 
calling all around town about this,\" while another told 
CONOFF that the USG was not helping its case by pushing so 
hard for a quick decision on a weekend. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
LESSON 3:  KEEP CI CASES IN THE INTERIOR MINISTRY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) For reasons that are still not entirely clear, the 
MFA appears to have been unhelpful in the case of the Al 
Balawis.  One very knowledgeable GOB source that that at a 
core Cabinet meeting on February 7, only the MFA argued 
against letting the Balawi children travel immediately.  In 
contrast, the upper echelons of the Ministry of Interior 
(MOI) were consistently in favor of letting the children 
travel.  We suspect that the MFA was more sensitive to the 
Saudi reaction than was the MOI--a sensitivity that led the 
MFA to commission a \"legal study\" of the issue.  (COMMENT: 
This \"study\" appears to have not been completed.  END 
COMMENT).  Given this sensitivity, resolving these types of 
cases through the MOI may be preferable. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
LESSON 4:  HAVE A CLEAR EXIT STRATEGY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) In the Al Shalawi case, Dhahran CONOFF was in 
regular communication with both Manama CONOFF and Mrs. Al 
Shalawi in the weeks prior to the event.  This communication 
allowed both CONOFFs to plan exactly what was needed for the 
Al Shalawis to depart.  In contrast, the Al Balawi children 
had no clear idea how they expected to leave Bahrain, and 
neither did their mother.  Without knowing more about exactly 
how, when, or with what documents the children would arrive 
at the Embassy, Post was not able to lay the groundwork for 
an easy departure, nor were we able to effectively allay the 
anxieties of the mother or children about what was going to 
happen. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
LESSON 5:  A LITTLE LUCK ALWAYS HELPS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The willingness of the Saudi father to allow the 
children to travel to their mother on a \"temporary visit\" was 
instrumental in the children receiving GOB permission to 
depart Bahrain for the US.  The father\'s consent gave the MFA 
the escape it was hoping for--it could placate the US without 
angering the Saudis.  However, this escape required a senior 
MFA official to explain (unconvincingly) to the Charge that 
it was illegal for someone to enter Bahrain on the passport 
of one nationality and depart using the passport of another 
nationality, but since the father did not object, it was OK 
for the children to leave using their US passports. 
(COMMENT:  A knowledgeable legal source looked at the 1965 
Bahraini Immigration Law and said that the law was silent on 
the issue of whether or not an alien had to enter and leave 
Bahrain using the same passport.  END COMMENT) 
 
8. (SBU) Our pressure certainly had the GOB looking for an 
escape, but if the father had reacted differently to what his 
wife told him, or if he believed that the children were still 
in Bahrain, the Al-Balawi children likely would still be in 
Bahrain. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
LESSON 6:  TRUST BUT VERIFY, AND THEN VERIFY AGAIN AND AGAIN 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
9. (SBU) After receiving assurances from senior levels of the 
GOB, verified through two different channels, that 
\"everything was taken care of\" and that the Al Balawi 
children would be allowed to depart, CONOFF showed up at the

SUBJECT: GOB\'S RESPONSE TO PENSION FUND SCANDAL 
 
REF: MANAMA 138 
 
Classified By: By CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Although the GOB responded swiftly to 
Parliament,s recommendations to rectify pension fund 
irregularities (see reftel), Parliamentary members still 
insist the GOB has not done enough and continue to call for 
legal action against the ministers involved. In addition, 
labor federation leaders condemn the GOB\'s actions amending 
pension fund laws without the federation\'s input.  With 
Parliamentarians perceiving that the public will not take the 
National Assembly seriously unless it removes a minister from 
office, we expect the Parliament to question the ministers 
with the objective of voting at least one out of office. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CHANGES TO PENSION FUND MANAGEMENT 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.    (U) According to press reports, at the February 8 
Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister announced major policy 
changes to guarantee independence of Bahrain,s two pension 
funds to improve both their efficiency and performance.  The 
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs and the Minister of 
Finance and National Economy will no longer manage the 
pension funds.  Instead, the Prime Minister plans to appoint 
personally new directors-general for both funds and to 
reorganize the GOSI pension fund board to consist of 15 
members; five representatives from the government, five from 
employers, and five highly experienced and qualified 
individuals registered with the funds.  Other GOSI management 
changes include shortening term appointments for auditors, 
director-generals and board members.  The Cabinet also 
amended the laws regulating the Public Fund Commission (PFC), 
separating its finances from the GOB,s general budget and 
appointing military sector representatives, financial 
experts, and auditors to the PFC board. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
LABOR AND PARLIAMENTARY REACTION TO GOB\'S ACTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3.    (U) Council of Representatives (COR) First Deputy 
Chairman Abdulhadi Marhoon commented to the press that the 
Cabinet,s actions concerning the pension funds should not 
obscure the Investigative Committee,s primary recommendation 
to hold the three ministers responsible for their violations. 
 On February 9, Investigative Committee Chairman Fareed Ghazi 
told the press that he viewed the Cabinet,s response as a 
step in the right direction but concurred with MP Marhoon 
that it was \"unsatisfactory to the public which expects a 
ministerial change.8 
 
4.  (U)  Anticipating the labor federation\'s reaction to the 
Cabinet\'s actions, in a public statement COR member Abdulnabi 
Salman suggested on February 9, that employees representative 
to the GOSI board should be elected through the General 
Federation of Bahraini Workers (GFBW) instead of appointed by 
the Prime Minister.  That same day, the GFBW publicly 
condemned the Cabinet for amending the PFC laws without its 
consultation, citing Article 8 of the Labor Law giving the 
labor federation the right to represent workers in all 
committee and councils concerning labor and labor issues. 
 
5.  (C)  A Shi\'a Parliamentarian told the CDA that the COR 
would certainly question the three ministers.  There was a 
strong push among nearly all members to do so.  He thought 
the Ministers would be called in when the National Assembly 
reconvenes in March. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT.  Public opinion regarding the government,s 
response to the investigation has been a mixed bag.  Some 
consider the GOB,s response to be a genuine desire to 
rectify the irregularities.  Others are more skeptical that 
officials are exchanging one set of poor managers for another 
that is personally appointed by the Prime Minister.  In its 
haste, the Cabinet\'s actions appears to have ignored 
established labor laws (see para. 4), furthering the opinion 
that the Prime Minister is just shuffling the deck.  This 
scandal is the first true test of Parliament\'s ability to 
hold government accountable.  Key members of the Parliament 
believe that the majority of Bahrainis will not take the 
National Assembly seriously unless they \"get a minister.\"  We 
expect the Parliament to question the ministers, the first 
constitutional step leading to a vote of no confidence. END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ROUSING RECEPTION OF FTA ROUND ONE IN BAHRAIN 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: The United States and Bahrain held round one of 
Free Trade Agreement negotiations in Manama, January 26-30. 
Government of Bahrain (GOB) officials across the board are 
thrilled with the progress the negotiating teams made during 
the first round, and this enthusiasm was echoed in the press. 
Momentum going into round two is high, with many negotiators 
hoping to finish in two rounds.  However, the Bahraini 
business community still seems puzzled about how the FTA can 
benefit them, and how their individual companies can take 
advantage of the upcoming trade regime changes.  We need to 
expand outreach efforts to risk-averse Bahrainis to get them 
to engage with U.S. companies and capitalize on the FTA\'s 
potential.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------------- 
GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN ECSTATIC 
------------------------------- 
 
2. GOB officials, from lead negotiator Minister of Finance 
and National Economy Saif to negotiating group leaders, 
participants, observers and coordinators, expressed 
exuberance at the progress and positive tenor of round one of 
FTA negotiations in Manama, January 26-30.  Several 
negotiating groups concluded or nearly concluded their work 
in the first round.  Despite the Eid holiday immediately 
following the round and the fact that many key players are 
currently in Washington with the Crown Prince\'s delegation, 
momentum toward round two is high.  Numerous Bahraini lead 
negotiators told ECONOFF after the round that they intend to 
conclude their chapters during round two, March 1-4 in 
Washington.  Services, Environment and IPR negotiators told 
ECONOFF at the end of the round that MEPI-funded technical 
assistance prior to negotiations helped them achieve fast 
results.  Likewise, the Environment lead told ECONOFF that 
working with Embassy Science Fellows in Fall 2003 helped them 
to better understand and articulate their technical 
assistance needs and thus to come to quick agreement on the 
substance of the proposed Environment MOU. 
 
-------------- 
PRESS POSITIVE 
-------------- 
 
3. The press put an overwhelmingly positive spin on FTA 
negotiations, and accuracy in reporting superseded the norm. 
In the two weeks following negotiations, only one editorial 
criticized FTA, hinting that the USG should not be trusted. 
 
4. Embassy paved the way for accurate reporting.  A week 
prior to negotiations, PAO and POL/ECON invited journalists 
to a roundtable discussion to provide background and answer 
questions about FTA.  Embassy provided journalists with an 
FTA factsheet and English/Arabic press release, both of which 
were widely quoted in press reports.  Optimistic soundbites 
by lead negotiators and the palpably warm and upbeat tenor 
surrounding negotiations combined with AUSTR Novelli\'s 
frequent and candid engagement with the press during the 
negotiations may have affirmed to the media that the 
information they had been given by the Embassy was reliable 
and that FTA would stimulate the economy.  EMBOFFS and 
Novelli were careful not to overpromise, using statistics 
from the experience in Jordan.  The media appreciated the 
honesty and large amount of information provided prior to and 
during the negotiations.  The result: widespread and 
accurate, in-depth coverage. 
 
------------------------------------- 
BAHRAINI BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAUTIOUS 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. The Bahraini business community has repeatedly heard from 
the GOB and the Embassy the message that FTA is primarily for 
their benefit. Embassy has regularly and frequently sat with 
or addressed the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
regarding the business opportunities an FTA might create for 
them.  Despite this outreach, DCM in Eid calls on three 
prominent business families February 1-2 found them curious 
about the FTA but puzzled about what they might do to 
capitalize on it.  Similarly, during the one business week 
since the round, businessmen from the Bahraini as well as the 
local U.S. business community met with ECONOFF to ask how the 
FTA will help their tourism, shipping, insurance and textile 
businesses, and, in very pragmatic terms, what to do next. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. GOB negotiators will continue to push the fast pace of 
negotiations in round two. MEPI-funded assistance was 
instrumental in creating this level of readiness.  We need 
now to formulate a plan to actualize the potential--in terms 
of trade, investment and jobs--this FTA can offer. 
7. As we have seen with Iraq reconstruction, the business 
community in Bahrain is curious about opportunities, but 
somewhat risk-averse.  They will need to be guided quite 
directly to see opportunities FTA offers them and to learn 
how to capitalize on them.  Bahrainis would be receptive to 
advice from Jordanians who have made FTA work for them.  This 
might be one avenue to achieving FTA-generated business 
successes.  However, we will need to be somewhat creative 
with resources, since Bahrain is not eligible to receive 
USAID funding.

Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford.  Reason 1.4 (D). 
 
1.  (U)  CTAG Ambassadors in Bahrain agreed U.S. Embassy-led 
efforts are meeting key Bahraini needs, but they wondered if 
the April 2004 Formula One race event\'s security would be 
adequate.  Over lunch at DCR February 17 with the Ambassadors 
from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the Japanese 
Charge, the CDA summarized USG efforts in counterterrorism: 
 
-- Continued U.S. assistance to the Bahrainis in the area of 
detecting explosives.  At DS/ATA expense, a Bahraini team 
from the Ministry of Interior and the Bahrain National 
Security Agency are standing up explosive detecting K-9 teams 
for training in the U.S.  In addition we have reviewed with 
the Bahrainis extensively how to set up large vehicle 
scanners to detect vehicles loaded with explosives as well as 
large crates loaded with explosives.  These scanners could be 
set up at the causeway coming from Saudi Arabia, at the 
airport, or seaport. 
 
-- Training the Bahrainis to manage crises.  Last autumn the 
USG funded training for a diverse  by a group of Bahraini 
first responders, and there is now a critical incident 
management training team in country working with Bahraini 
Ministry of Interior and other GOB officials.  In addition, 
we anticipate an S/CT exercise involving senior policy makers 
in April, 2004. 
 
2.  (U)  The CDA also noted that the embassy hopes that an 
attache from the U.S. Treasury Department\'s Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) will arrive in country during the next 
six months.  The British Ambassador noted news reports that 
the financial action task force (FATF) is considering 
establishing a regional office in Manama.  The FATF regional 
office could provide synergy for work by the OFAC attache in 
Bahrain and in the region.  CDA said that the Bahrainis had 
raised the location of the FATF office with U.S. Treasury 
Department officials, but no U.S. Government had not 
announced which potential site it would support. 
 
3.  (C)  British Ambassador said that HMG was working with 
Bahraini military but this did not directly involve 
counterterrorism.  He said that there is also a British 
expert team training Bahraini police in BIP and close 
protection. 
 
4.  (C)  The French, Russian and German Ambassadors said that 
Bahrain had made no requests from them for assistance in the 
field of counterterrorism and they therefore have no programs 
ongoing in Bahrain.  The Japanese Charge said that Tokyo\'s 
focus is on building up capabilities among south east Asian 
countries, rather than countries in the Persian Gulf. 
 
5.  (C)  The Charge and British Ambassador emphasized that 
Bahrain still needs a law against conspiracy, so that the 
government can arrest those conspiring to conduct criminal 
acts.  The British Ambassador noted that he had sent many 
letters to different government officials on this issue.  UK 
poloff said their sources in the Ministry of Interior 
reported that the Bahraini Government has received copies of 
the United Arab Emirates anti-conspiracy law, in addition to 
copies of the American and British laws.  None of our 
diplomatic colleagues knew if there is, in fact, a Bahraini 
draft conspiracy law in circulation within the Bahraini 
government.  Several of the diplomats agreed getting 
Parliament to pass such a law quickly would be problematic. 
 
6.  (C) All agreed another joint CTAG push with the Bahraini 
MFA to secure Bahraini Ratification of all UN anti-terror 
resolutions would be useful.  CDA said the U.S. embassy, as 
CTAG chair in Bahrain, would take the lead. 
 
7.  (C)  Several of the diplomats expressed concern about 
security in the build up to the early April 2004 Formula One 
race in Bahrain.  CDA stressed that the embassy has received 
no intelligence pointing to such a threat, but that it is 
still early.  None of the other diplomats report having 
received intelligence, but several expressed vague concerns 
about potential security lapses.  The likelihood that Bahrain 
will receive upwards of 100,000 visitors during the first 
several days of April add to the concerns.  They anticipate 
there will be a large surge in traffic coming over the 
causeway from Saudi Arabia, but the scanners which the 
government is slowly moving to buy might not yet be in place.

SUBJECT: BOYCOTTERS RIG LABOR UNION FEDERATION BOARD 
ELECTIONS. 
 
 
Classified By: By Charge D\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Bahrain\'s two leading opposition societies 
colluded to fix the labor union federation board elections 
with the plan to use the labor movement as a political 
platform.  By ignoring standard democratic election and bylaw 
procedures, opposition parties realized their plans but also 
thwarted the board\'s ability to legislate, make decisions, 
and set a labor agenda.  Disillusioned by the opposition 
parties\' machinations, several large unions are attempting to 
extricate themselves from this quagmire and are discussing 
the establishment of a second, non-politicized federation. 
National Democratic Action Society and Al Wifaq\'s resorting 
to non-democratic methods to gain control of Bahrain\'s union 
federation board raises serious questions about the 
societies\' long-term commitment to democracy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  Even though the General Federation of Bahraini 
Workers (GFBW) notified several government agencies about 
holding its first ever federation conference, no government 
official offered to speak at the conference opening or 
sponsor a venue.  (NOTE:  It is normal in Bahrain for 
ministers to \'patronize\' public events related to their 
ministries.  END NOTE)  The GFBW went ahead anyway and one 
hundred and forty-nine union delegates attended the 
conference, representing 39 labor unions from both the public 
and private sectors.  The purpose of the three-day conference 
was to ratify the federation\'s statute and bylaws.  GFBW 
invited the Arab Workers Union to guide election proceedings 
and to establish federation bylaws and operational procedures. 
 
--------------------- 
COOKING THE ELECTIONS 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  GFBW Labor Consultant Dr. Mohammed Merbati told 
PolOFF that inviting the Arab Workers Union brought 
unexpected results. He believes that the Arab Workers Union 
came to the conference to ensure that a non-democratic \'Arab\' 
federation be established, in line with the federations of 
Iran, Iraq and Kuwait. Standard democratic election 
procedures allow for each union member to vote for its own 
board and also to elect conference delegates to represent 
them at the foundational conference. (the number of each 
union\'s conference delegates is proportional to the size its 
union.)  To ensure a predominance of opposition party 
delegates, Al Wifaq and National Democratic Action Society 
(NDAS) requested that the Arab Workers Union forego the 
selection process of voting for conference delegates.  The 
Union complied and invited delegates directly from union 
boards, the majority of whom has affiliation with the two 
opposition societies. 
 
4.  (C)  Bringing the delegate selection process to light, 
\"Al Ayam\" published an article on January 11 also claiming 
that opposition societies clandestinely agreed to divide the 
GFBW board membership among themselves; 5 from NDAS and 6 
from Al Wifaq. Journalists accused both opposition societies 
of hijacking the elections and politicizing the trade union 
movement. However, on January 18, media reports subsided when 
the GFBW Central Council elected independent candidate Abdul 
Ghaffar Abdul Hussain its General Secretary.  Dr. Merbati 
explained to PolFSN that neither opposition society had issue 
with Hussain as General Secretary based on his experience and 
stature.  However, Al Wifaq member Adel Al Abassi told PolOFF 
he was angered to find out about Hussain\'s appointment. 
Hussain used to be a Shura Council member of the old regime. 
In the 1990\'s Hussain was named General Secretary of the 
GOB\'s National Labor Committee, precursor to the GFBW.  In 
that position, Hussain publicly accused Shi\'a opposition 
leaders (many of whom are now leaders in Al Wifaq) of being a 
\"bunch of terrorists.\"  Al Abassi surmised that Hussain 
tricked both Al Wifaq and NDAS labor leaders by telling both 
he was aligning with them. The other two independent 
candidates aligned themselves with NDAS to secure seats on 
the board. In the end press reports were correct: the 
election results established a central council with 5 NDAS, 6 
Al Wifaq, 1 independent, and 1 from National Democratic 
Congregation. 
 
----------------------- 
FEELING USED AND ABUSED 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  A review of board committee positions reveal that 
NDAS holds the more prestigious positions on the board.  Al 
Abassi told PolOFF that unlike NDAS, Al Wifaq is not an 
expert in labor.  Al Wifaq colluded with NDAS not realizing 
that committee designations made a difference in the balance 
of power. An unauthorized Deputy Secretary General position 
was created at the outcome of the elections and given to Al 
Wifaq. Although Deputy Secretary General would appear to be 
the second-ranking position on the board, the position does 
not exist in the bylaws and has no authoritative power. Al 
Wifaq feels used by NDAS.  Both NDAS and al-Wifaq feel used 
by Abdul Ghaffar Hussain.  Now Al Wifaq is making an effort 
to woo the independent board members away from NDAS to try to 
rectify the imbalance.  Al Abassi added that it does not help 
that every Al Wifaq member on the board is a \'soft spoken 
moderate.\'  He said there is talk among Al Wifaq board 
members that the decision try and dominate the labor federal 
board was a political mistake.  Some believe Al Wifaq can 
gain more ground politically by focusing on real solutions to 
actaul labor issues. 
6.  (U)  In a statement to the press, GFBW Assistant 
Secretary for Activities and Social Protection and member of 
 
SIPDIS 
the National Democratic Congregation Khalid Al Aradi resigned 
his position because of the NDAS and Al Wifaq collusion. His 
replacement, Al Menbar Islamiyya member Qassab also announced 
his resignation for the same reasons.  NDAS member Almousawi 
claims Al Aradi quit because he failed to get the prestigious 
Assistant Secretary position for Arab and International 
Affairs.  Both Almousawi and Al Abassi claim Al Aradi and 
Qassab took the opportunity to embarrass NDAS and Al Wifaq. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
GFBW GOING NOWHERE; SOME UNIONS HEADED ELSEWHERE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (C)  With all the attention focused on getting opposition 
leaders in board positions, the conference failed to 
establish clear operational guidelines for the board.  Even 
though 8 of the 12 federation board members have over 100 
years of combined labor movement expertise and knew each 
other in the labor movement many years prior to joining 
political societies, the lack of established bylaws and 
operational procedures has paralyzed the federation.  Dr. 
Merbati claims that instead of creating a legitimate 
federation with a vision for the labor movement, the 
opposition socities crippled the federation, tossed out its 
credibility for the next 4 years, ultimately damaging the 
labor movement.  Shura Council member Faisal Fulad told 
PolOFF that union representatives from Batelco, Automotive, 
Petrochem, BenGaz, Ministry of Interior, Gulf Airline 
Stewards, and Alba contacted Dr. Merbati and himself to find 
a way to leave GFBW and start a new federation that has no 
political affiliations whatsoever. 
 
8.  (C)  COMMENT.  Opposition societies went to great lengths 
to rig the GFBW board elections, ensuring they were neither 
free nor fair.  This has resulted in many unions wanting to 
leave the GFBW and establish a second federation.  It also 
demonstrates their desire for a legitimate democratic 
federation. Although Al-Wifaq and NDAS colluded to gain 
control of the board, the emerging competition between them 
to wield board power revealed that there is friction among 
the political parties which boycotted the October 2002 
parliamentary election.  NDAS/Al-Wifaq have tarnished their 
image and certainly have raised serious questions about their 
long-term commitment to fair-play and democracy.

SUBJECT: GOB BARS INTERNATIONAL VISITORS FROM ATTENDING A 
CONFERENCE ORGANIZED BY OPPOSITION SOCIETIES. 
 
 
Classified By: By Charge D\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The GOB stirred a new debate here this 
week, which some local observers say leads to questions on 
how much the government is committed to real political 
liberalization.  The GOB impeded a conference organized by 
the political opposition on the constitution.  The GOB 
claimed that the organizers did not obtain official 
permission to hold the event, justifying the GOB\'s actions to 
turn away international attendees and order the venue 
provider to cancel its contract with conference organizers. 
It denied entry to fifteen international political activists 
who were invited to participate in the event.  However, laws 
regulating societies do not require that societies obtain 
permission from the GOB.  They only need to notify the GOB, 
and in this case, they did.  In threatening the boycotters 
with legal action, turning away international guests and 
canceling venue providers, the GOB acted in at least a 
high-handed manner and drew unwanted international attention 
to its unbecoming behavior, tarnishing its image of a leader 
of democratic reform in the region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
BOYCOTTERS LOOK AT FEBRUARY 14 DIFFERENTLY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) The four political societies that boycotted the 
October 2002 parliamentary elections (Al Wifaq National 
Democratic Action Society (NDAS), National Democratic 
Congregation, and National Islamic Action Society), organized 
a two-day conference that began on February 14 to propose 
changes to Bahrain\'s current constitution.  However, the 
medium of change proposed by the conference was to amend the 
1973 Constitution as stipulated by the National Action 
Charter (a broad statement of political reform objectives 
approved by referendum in 2001.)  Claiming that the 2002 
Constitution was imposed upon the people and not 
contractually adopted, the societies named the conference, 
&Towards a Contractual Constitution for a Constitutional 
Monarchy.8 
 
3.  (U)  Not only was the purpose of the conference 
controversial but also its date. Organizers chose February 14 
as the opening day of the conference because it marked the 
third anniversary of the King,s political contract with the 
people ) the National Action Charter.  Bahrain Center for 
Human Rights President Nabeel Rajab, told Poloff February 16 
the boycotters chose this particular day of national 
celebration to provoke a reaction from the government. 
 
----------------------- 
THE BOYCOTTERS PETITION 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  At the end of the conference, participants voted on 
proposed amendments to the 1973 Constitution, transforming it 
into a public petition to be submitted to the King.  The 
attendees elected a general secretariat to follow-up on the 
proposed changes.  Out of the 400 invitees who indicated that 
they would attend the conference, 217 did. 
 
5.  (U) Al Wifaq President Shaikh Ali Salman insisted that 
the intent of the conference was peaceful and in no way a 
vehicle to undermine the GOB\'s prestige.  Instead, the 
participants sought to consolidate reform in four major 
areas:  transparency, protection of public funds, true 
parliamentary power, and establishment of political parties. 
Al Wifaq member Adel Al Abassi told Poloff that the public 
petition proposed amendments to the 1973 Constitution, in 
particular, reducing the power of the Shura Council.  Al 
Abassi estimated that conference organizers will release the 
full text of the petition to the press next week. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
THE BOYCOTTERS SUCCEED IN PROVOKING THE GOB 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed Al Mutawa told 
the press on January 10 that each day Bahrain witnesses an 
example of the genuine application of democracy.  The fact 
that the boycotters\' constitutional seminar will be held is a 
testament that democracy under the new constitution is 
working, he said. 
 
7.  (C) In the days preceding the conference, the GOB turned 
Al Mutawa\'s words on their head, by systematically seeking to 
prevent the convening of the conference and to diminish 
conference attendance.  The GOB turned away 15 speakers and 
participants from Kuwait, Egypt, Qatar, France, and England 
at ports of entry.  One of the international visitors slated 
to attend the conference was prominent MP and former Chairman 
of Kuwait,s Parliament (Majlis Al Umma) Ahmed Al Sadoon, who 
drove to Bahrain but only to be turned away on the Saudi 
causeway.  The international press carried the barring of 
foreign participants, highlighting the GOB\'s illegal actions. 
 Regionally, the GOB went as far as to contact their Kuwaiti 
and Egyptian counterparts to pressure their citizens not to 
attend.  Locally, the GOB also lobbied foreign diplomats not 
to attend.  (The MFA called the CDA three times to strongly 
urge officers not to attend.)  MFA MinState told CDA that the 
conference was illegal. MFA also contacted the British, 
French, and German ambassadors, those diplomats told us 
February 17. 
 
8.  (U) On February 12, the Minister of Labor and Social 
Affairs (MOLSA) Majeed Al Alawi sent a letter to the four 
societies notifying them of their need to obtain permission 
before holding the conference.  He stated: &there is no 
problem with holding the event as long as a license and 
permission are obtained from MOLSA according to regulations 
set by the law.8  Organizers responded to Al Alawi,s 
statement reporting that Al Alawi notified them that they 
were in violation of the law but did not mention which law 
had been violated, adding that no law requires them to obtain 
permission, nor do they want to set the precedence for the 
Ministry to control societies, activities.  In a statement 
to &Al Wasat8, the country\'s only independent newspaper, 
Minister of Information Nabeel Al Hamer warned that the GOB 
will take matters to the courts if the societies fail to 
obtain permission to hold the conference. (NOTE:  We know of 
no law that requires societies to obtain permission to hold 
an event; Decree 73 for societies only requires them to 
notify the Ministry of Interior at least three days prior to 
an event taking place. END NOTE) 
 
9.  (C) When the societies did not respond to the threats by 
canceling their event, the GOB, on January 13, ordered the 
Radisson hotel to cancel the contract with organizers just 
hours before the start of the conference.  Hotel Manager Mark 
Phillips told PolOff that he received a letter  urgently 
requesting, he cancel the contract and informing him that no 
one should be allowed to enter the conference without a 
 letter of permission, issued by MOLSA.  Phillips relayed 
this information to preparatory committee member Jalila Al 
Sayed, and withdrew the Radisson as a venue. 
 
10.  (U) Anticipating this might happen, conference 
organizers made previous arrangements to contract with two 
contingent venues.  Even though the General Organization for 
Youth and Sports (GOYS) sent a letter warning the Al-Ouruba 
Club management of the possibility of losing its operation 
license, Al-Ouruba club management agreed to hold the 
conference on its premises. 
 
11.  (U) In an attempt to explain GOB\'s actions, on February 
14, Minister of Information Nabeel Al Hammer issued a public 
statement, \"We will not allow foreigners to interfere in our 
affairs.\"  The Gulf Daily News (GDN) published from the Royal 
Court Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa a statement 
from the King.  It said, \"With all due respect to foreign 
experts, it is important that the debate over the kingdom\'s 
internal affairs remains restricted to its citizens and that 
no-one else take part in it.8 
 
12.  (C) COMMENT. Overall, the conference would have largely 
been a non-event had the GOB ignored it.  The GOB\'s impeding 
movement of foreign political activists seeking to attend 
generated unwanted international publicity.  Pan Arab media 
channel al-Jazeera and widely read Arabic newspaper al-Hayat 
reported extensively on the conference.  The King\'s remark 
that foreigners should stay out of debates about internal 
Bahraini politics is a vivid reminder of government 
sensitivities.  The GOB acted in a high-handed manner at 
least, tarnishing its image of a regional leader of 
democratic reforms and respect for human rights.

1. SUMMARY: In 2003, Bahrain sustained a strong anti-piracy 
policy, seizing nearly 468,000 audiovisual products, mostly 
DVDs. The GOB legalized its Microsoft software and is now 
purchasing, rather than illegally copying, additional 
software products. Bahrain is holding up enactment of eight 
draft IPR laws that bring the country into TRIPS compliance 
so the laws can be brought into conformity with FTA 
requirements.  Legislation to implement WIPO Copyright (WCT) 
and Performances and Phonograms (WPPT) treaties is pending in 
Parliament. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Enforcement of optical media piracy regulations still strong 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
2. Optical media piracy in Bahrain is not homegrown, Jamal 
Dawood Salman, Ministry of Information\'s Director of 
Publications and Press, told ECONOFF February 16.  Salman 
said pirated DVDs and CDs mainly enter Bahrain from the Far 
East, primarily from Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia; 
parallel imports of Zone 1 products occur principally through 
direct sales from the United States, or are brought acoss the 
Causeway from Saudi Arabia.  The proportion of pirated items 
seized at the border is increasing relative to those found 
during shop raids, Salman said, because fewer illegal 
products are making it to the shelves. 
 
3. The Directorate performs 550 shop raids per year.  During 
2003, Salman\'s office confiscated 467,820 illegal audiovisual 
items and destroyed 33,730 of these (NOTE: Parallel imports, 
e.g., Zone 1 DVDs, often purchased via the internet, are 
generally returned to sender. END NOTE).  The Directorate is 
working in conjunction with the Motion Picture Association, 
directly with studios such as Warner Brothers, Disney, and 
Paramount, and with the Arabian Anti-piracy Alliance to 
improve detection and stem the flow of pirated products into 
Bahrain.  COMMENT: Making Bahrain a Zone 1 movie outlet would 
substantially reduce Bahrain\'s parallel import problem.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
----------------------------- 
Government software legalized 
----------------------------- 
 
4. Through an October 5, 2003 MOU with Microsoft, the GOB 
legalized all its Microsoft software.  The agreement is 
designed to keep the GOB legal by offering new releases, 
technical support, training and special incentives for 
schools and students.  February 16, Bahrain Microsoft 
Business Development Manager Samir Benmakhlouf told ECONOFF 
that GOB desktops were \"clean\", i.e., free from illegal 
software, and that the ministries were buying (rather than 
illegally copying) additional products.  He said that the GOB 
is complying fully with the MOU and its commitment to IPR 
protection. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Proposed IPR legislation under review for TRIPS and FTA 
compliance 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
5. Bahrain is serious about developing quality intellectual 
property protection legislation, Jameel Al Alawi, Director of 
Agreements and Treaties, Directorate of Legal Affairs told 
ECONOFF February 16.  Within the last year, he said, the 
Bahraini Parliament passed three IP laws: Trade Secrets, 
Geographical Indicators, and Patents.  The Trademarks law is 
with the parliament, ready for a vote.  The Copyright law 
received cabinet approval, but now the Cabinet is modifying 
it to fulfill anticipated FTA obligations.  The Cabinet is 
currently studying Integrated Circuits, Plant Varieties, and 
Industrial Design drafts.  In addition, the UPOV treaty on 
plant varieties is under review at the cabinet. 
 
6. Al Alawi told ECONOFF February 16 that Legal Affairs is 
holding back the new intellectual property laws designed to 
bring Bahrain\'s regulatory system into TRIPS compliance to 
assure that they also conform to negotiated FTA requirements 
and will not need to be amended.  To that end, the Legal 
Affairs Directorate has provided English translations of 
these (draft) laws to the USG for study by appropriate 
agencies. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT), WIPO Performances and Phonograms 
Treaty (WPPT) accessions soon 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
7. Legislation supporting the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and 
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) has been 
passed by the cabinet and parliamentary committees and is 
currently with the Council of Representatives (the elected 
house of Bahrain\'s National Assembly).  Jameel Al Alawi, 
Director of Agreements and Treaties, Directorate of Legal 
Affairs told ECONOFF February 16 that he expects this 
legislation to pass once parliament reconvenes, within the 
next few weeks.

1.  (U)  On February 22, POL/ECON Chief asked MFA Assistant 
Undersecretary for Coordination and Follow-up Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa if he could provide an update on 
anti-TIP activities since ref A.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz is the 
overall coordinator of TIP-related work with the USG.  P/E

more precise reporting to support TIP tier rankings and 
inquired if the GOB had any statistical data on TIP 
prevention, investigations and prosecution that could be 
included in Post\'s report.  P/E Chief noted that Post\'s draft 
is due on March 1. 
 
2.  (U)  P/E Chief suggested to Shaikh Abdul Aziz that it 
would be especially helpful to have current information on 
two high profile cases recently featured in the press.  In 
particular, P/E Chief mentioned the case of a Bangladeshi 
worker in a pending labor case that was forcibly repatriated 
and the case of Anita Verma (see reftel B).  Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz said he would raise these two cases in a meeting that he 
had already scheduled with Deputy Attorney General Shaikh 
Khalid bin Ali Al Khalifa to follow up on 200 worker abuse 
cases that Bahrain Centre for Human Rights activist Selma 
Bala has submitted for action.  P/E Chief added that we would 
like to mention Bahrain\'s ratification of the UN Convention 
on Transnational Crime in the report. 
 
3.  (U)  Shaikh Abdul Aziz had no information for P/E Chief 
and admitted that MFA had homework to do.  He tentatively 
scheduled a meeting with A/DCM and PolOFF on March 3 to 
provide an update on anti-TIP activities.  Since the TIP 
report is due on March 1, P/E Chief said that we would write 
the report based on the information in hand and submit it by 
the deadline.  However, the report would state that an update 
would be produced after the meeting with Shaikh Abdul Aziz.

I. Yes. There have been anti-government demonstrations in the 
last twelve months concerning democratic reform and 
unemployment issues. 
J. No 
K. 500-4,000 
L. Peaceful for the most part. Small segments of teenagers 
within the larger group violently engage passersby and police. 
M. No 
 
2. (C) MACRO CONFLICT CONDITIONS 
 
A. There are no current interstate or intrastate conflicts in 
Bahrain.  However, Shi\'a dissatisfaction remains an area of 
concern and deeply motivated by the government\'s (Sunni) 
inability to deliver on political reform promises.  The 
Embassy is closely monitoring Bahrain\'s political reforms and 
the populations\' reactions. 
B. Primarily in Manama and northern Bahrain. 
C. Yes 
D. Yes.  Both the Sunni and Shi\'a sects have demonstrated 
anti-Americanism in the past.  Anti-Americanism is not 
endemic in Bahrain and is usually demonstrated in response to 
some USG foreign policy position or military action.  For 
example, during OIF, four anti-American protests took place 
outside the walls of the Embassy. 
 
 
3. (C) HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES 
 
A. Yes.  Law enforcement agencies are professional, 
reasonably well trained and responsive. 
B. Yes.  Post is in the second year of a three year ATA 
training program with the Ministry of Interior and National 
Security Agency.  So far, training provided by ATA and DOD 
has been very well received and noticeably increased the 
skill level of the Bahrain police, security agency and 
military. 
C. No 
D. Yes 
E. Yes 
F. Yes.  The Bahrain National Security Agency (BNSA) has made 
several significant arrests in the last twelve months.  In 
February 2003 the BNSA arrested five Bahraini men suspected 
of planning a terrorist attack against westerners.  Two were 
convicted of possessing illegal firearms and sentenced to 
jail, but the other three were released because of lack of 
evidence to support a prosecution.  Bahrain\'s lack of a 
conspiracy law prevents the Government from arresting, trying 
and convicting terrorists before they can put plans into 
action.  The BNSA arrested an Iraqi intelligence agent in 
March 2003 after he set off a small explosive device near the 
US Naval Support Activity in Bahrain.  The security services 
have also detained/arrested 50 other individuals known to 
have ties to Al-Qaida. 
G. Yes 
H. Very good 
I. Average 
J. Average 
 
INDIGENOUS TERRORISM 
 
4. (C) ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST GROUPS 
 
A. Yes 
B. 3 Groups.  Hizballah, Al-Qaida and The Islamic Front for 
the Liberation of Bahrain. 
C. No 
D. N/A 
E. No 
F. No 
G. Country-Wide 
H. N/A 
 
5. (C) OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS 
 
A. No 
B. N/A 
C. No 
D. N/A 
E. N/A 
 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM 
 
6. (S/NF) TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST INDICATORS 
 
A. Yes.  Hizballah and Al-Qaida have a known presence in 
country. 
B. The cells have operational, financial and support presence 
in Bahrain. Hizballah flags fly at every anti-US 
demonstration. 
C. No 
D. No 
E. Yes.  Although Bahrain is well known as a moderate 
country, it is nonetheless an Islamic country.  Hizballah, 
Al-Qaida and other Islamic terrorist groups proclaiming 
resistance to the United States\' presence in the region have 
generated some sympathies.  This does not however, 
necessarily translate into a call to arms. 
F. The EAC is aware of this presence and is particularly 
concerned with the Iranians.  There has been IRGC 
surveillance of US military facilities in the past, but none 
reported recently.  The EAC is also aware and concerned about 
a Chinese trade office located 30 meters from the Embassy 
parking lot.  There is no information linking these hostile 
intelligence services to potential anti-American terrorist 
acts. 
G. Although weapons are illegal in Bahrain, the EAC is 
concerned about past and present indicators of weapons 
availability.  In February 2003, five militants who were 
known to be targeting Americans were arrested with four 
AK-47/AK-74 rifles and over 1000 rounds of ammunition. 
Recently in Saudi Arabia, there have been numerous seizures 
of weapons by the authorities.  In one instance, combined 
with a Saudi government weapons seizure was the arrest of two 
Bahraini men whose intentions are still unknown.  This area 
is of special concern to the EAC as Bahrain is a mere 24 
kilometers from Saudi Arabia and at best 10% of the 5,000 
vehicles which enter Bahrain daily from Saudi Arabia are 
searched.

SUBJECT: CONSPIRACY LAW POSSIBILITIES - MEETING WITH MOJ 
 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Upon return from his Washington trip, the Crown 
Prince placed a wake-up call to the Justice Minister to ask 
about Bahrain\'s conspiracy law, the Minister told CDA and 
PolOff on February 22.  Minister of Justice Jawad bin Salim 
Al Arayed asked us what a conspiracy law should do.  The CDA 
explained that Bahraini security officials told us that the 
GOB can only detain a person who is in possession of illegal 
weapons or has already committed an act of violence.  A 
conspiracy law would allow the GOB to detain a person who is 
suspected of planning a violent act, and if found guilty of 
such planning, convict in a court of law and imprison him. 
The Charge cited the three detained suspects the GOB released 
last year for lack of evidence or a conspiracy law.  The 
Charge said we are concerned that these people are still 
planning to commit violent criminal acts against US citizens 
in Bahrain. 
 
2.  (C)  Assistant Undersecretary and Chief Prosecutor Shaikh 
Khalid bin Ali Al Khalifa  who joined the meeting said that 
Articles 152, 157 and 158 of the Criminal Procedures Law 
address various procedures for terrorist acts.  Shaikh Khalid 
reiterated that evidence must link conspirators and indicate 
that the planned violent act would occur within the borders 
of Bahrain.  Shaikh Khalid said the three detainees were 
released for lack of this type of evidence.  CDA shot back 
that this a why Bahrain needs a conspiracy law.  Because of 
all the Islamic conservatives in Parliament, the Justice 
Minister doubted that Parliament would ever pass such a law. 
 
3.  (U)  Having said that, Al Arayed said there might be 
other avenues to move ahead.  He asked to review the US 
conspiracy law.  Although Post forwarded copies of the law on 
at least two occasions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Al 
Arayed confirmed that he never received any of these copies. 
Charge mentioned that Jordan used its laws to detain persons 
suspected of criminal conspiracy.  Shaikh Khalid also 
mentioned that Morocco recently passed a law on terrorism. 
Al Arayed requested copies of these laws to review.  Shaikh 
Khalid promised to expeditiously review the laws and discuss 
them with us. 
 
4.  (C)  RSO has already solicited copies of both the 
Jordanian conspiracy and Moroccan terrorism laws from RSO 
Amman and Rabat, respectively. 
 
5.  (S)  COMMENT.  The Minister\'s prognosis that a conspiracy 
law would be a tough sell in Parliament is likely right. 
Some Sunni Islamists in the Parliament and even a secular 
member of the Shi\'a opposition are sympathetic to those 
briefly detained last year on suspicion of conspiring to 
commit criminal acts. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED.  Parliament notwithstanding 
Minister Al Arayed is willing to engage.  A visit by US legal 
experts to discuss contents of Bahraini and other Arab 
states\' laws would be very useful. The quicker we could get 
such a visit, the better.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR UNDERSECRETARY GROSSMAN\'S VISIT TO 
BAHRAIN 
 
 
Classified By: Charge Robert S. Ford.  Reason 1.4(D). 
 
1.  (C)   Mr. Grossman, the American Embassy in Bahrain looks 
forward to your visit next week, and we know the Bahrainis 
will be anxious to talk to you about the Greater Middle East 
Initiative.  Bahrain, a Major Non-NATO Ally, and the United 
States are long-time friends, and King Hamad is a 
particularly strong supporter of the President.  We will seek 
a meeting for you with him. The King telephoned Ambassador 
Neumann in Baghdad on February 22 to ask about the Greater 
Middle East Initiative, and he said he might issue a public 
statement in support of it.  The King perceives that he and 
his country are among the leading reform success stories in 
the Arab World. 
 
2.  (C)  On other foreign policy issues, King Hamad and his 
government are anxious that we stabilize Iraq.  They are 
nervous about a newly assertive Shia majority in Iraq because 
the Sunni Al-Khalifas rule a Shia majority in Bahrain. 
Meanwhile, King Hamad and his team also hope that the United 
States will be able to spur faster progress on the Middle 
East peace process to rebuild U.S. credibility.  They view 
greater U.S. credibility as very important to our engaging 
more deeply with the public in Bahrain on issues like 
democracy. 
 
3.  (C)  King Hamad has liberalized some aspects of the 
Bahraini political system.  He released three years ago all 
political prisoners, and some who used to be in political 
exile came home to work in the press or even in government. 
However, many Shia want more so they boycotted the 2002 
parliamentary elections.  The King for his part has no 
intention of handing full power to the Shia. 
 
4.  (C) The reestablished national Parliament, with its 
elected lower house, is slowly growing more assertive. 
Notably, earlier this year it investigated financial scandals 
at the government-managed social security fund and compelled 
the government to implement transparency reforms.  The 
parliamentary investigation may cost a minister or two their 
jobs.  The King perceives the Parliament\'s work to be a net 
positive, although at times its members are too bombastic for 
his taste.  In any case, he is determined that the 
parliamentary experience move forward and always at a 
controlled speed. 
 
5.  (C)  We are working with the Parliament and nascent 
Bahrain political parties through a MEPI-funded NDI program. 
This popular NDI program encompasses training of 
parliamentary deputies and politicians from all sides of the 
Bahraini political spectrum, including those who boycotted 
the 2002 elections.  Notably, NDI works with Islamic 
conservatives who are among America\'s most vocal critics in 
Bahrain.  The British, meanwhile, also are starting a program 
of institution-building at the Bahraini Parliament. 
 
6.  (C)  The U.S. is also working with the Bahrainis in the 
area of judicial reform through a MEPI-funded program with 
the American Bar Association (ABA). This new program is a 
follow-up to the September 2003 judicial reform conference 
held in Bahrain with Supreme Court Justice O\'Connor.  An ABA 
staffer in Bahrain is setting up a training program for 
judges and investigators.  The Justice Minister is committed 
to moving ahead, but he cautions that American involvement in 
judicial reform in Bahrain is highly sensitive.  In 
particular, strong Islamist elements in the Ministry and 
Parliament suspect we will overthrow the Islamic principles 
imbedded in the Bahraini judicial system in favor of western 
principles.  The Minister wants the ABA program to stay low 
profile, therefore. 
 
7.  (C)  We are also engaged deeply with Bahrain on economic 
issues.  Bahrain\'s economy is perhaps the most open in the 
Arab world, according to the latest assessment from the 
Heritage Foundation.  However, the economy is not generating 
enough jobs, and unemployment is a big political issue. We 
are now negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Bahrain.  The 
government here hopes the FTA will lead to greater foreign 
direct investment and jobs.  We in turn are using the FTA 
negotiations to leverage additional economic reforms.  The 
Bahraini economic policy team is small and at times 
overwhelmed by the amount of work generated by the FTA.  We 
have a small MEPI-funded technical assistance program, but so 
far its impact has been relatively limited. 
 
8.  (SBU) We are also deeply engaged with Bahrain on the 
educational and cultural side through the Middle East 
Partnership Initiative and ECA\'s Partnership for Learning 
(P4L) programs.  We are currently implementing six new MEPI 
and P4L programs: 
 
-- Journalism training via Internews; 
-- Two MEPI university linkages with the University of 
Bahrain; 
-- Partnership For Learning Undergraduate Studies; 
-- Introducing civics education in K-12 public schools via 
Civitas; 
-- Arabic Language Book Program for elementary students; 
-- Junior Achievement in high schools. 
 
Our contacts at the Ministry of Education and the University 
of Bahrain welcome our scholarships, linkages, and 
leadership/exchange programs for high school and collage 
students.  Bahrainis welcome U.S. education and training 
because they believe this will help them to solve their 
unemployment problem and compete economically with their 
neighbors.  Education officials are undergoing their own 
educational reform process.  They want our programs to fit in 
with these ongoing changes in curriculum and training that 
are already underway.  The pace of education reform can be 
slow; the Ministry\'s absorptive capacity is limited in part 
by the shortage of trained managers and administrators.  We 
are also getting some push back from mid-level officials, 
principals, teachers, and even parents who either worry that 
we are trying to introduce too much democracy too quickly, or 
that American culture may overwhelm traditional Bahraini 
Muslim culture. 
 
9.  (U)  Our team looks forward to meeting you in Bahrain.

MUST STAY LOW PROFILE 
 
REF: 03 MANAMA 237 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  The Minister of Justice has decided that 
the MEPI-funded ABA judicial reform project should maintain a 
low profile to avoid criticism or friction from Muslim 
conservatives.  He promised the Charge on February 23 that 
the ABA representatives would have full freedom to meet and 
communicate with all Bahrainis.  However, the ABA contractor 
claimed that the Minister backpedaled on this commitment on 
February 24.  The ABA representative said he cannot guarantee 
the success of the project with limitations to access and 
communications.  An important follow-up project to the Arab 
Judicial Forum, its success is important to MEPI\'s regional 
judicial reform effort.  The situation appears manageable but 
may require a significant investment of time and intensive 
management to find ways for the ABA representative to achieve 
his objectives while meeting the Minister\'s concerns. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  Charge met with the Minister of Justice Jawad bin 
Salim Al Arayed on February 23 to discuss some concerns ABA 
representative John Hermina raised with PolOff about his 
working conditions at the MOJ.  Hermina mentioned to us on 
February 18 that Al Arayed instructed Hermina not to seek ABA 
office space outside the MOJ, not to contact legal 
professionals outside the MOJ, not to seek publicity for the 
judicial reform project and not to discuss the project with 
anyone.  Hermina told PolOff that under these conditions, he 
could not guarantee the success of the project. 
 
3.  (C)  In defense of his instructions, Al Arayed told 
Charge that he knows how best to maneuver through the MOJ and 
the legal community to effect change.  The Minister reminded 
CDA and PolOff that John Hermina is an American Egyptian 
Coptic Christian and that the majority of judges in the 
Ministry are Muslim Egyptians.  \"I need to minimize potential 
friction between the MOJ, Hermina, and the Muslim judges,\" he 
said.  He added that many Ministry employees are Sunni Muslim 
conservatives, not to mention the Sunni conservative cast of 
Parliament.  As a Shi\'a minister constantly under criticism 
from this quarter, Al Arayed said he needs ABA to keep a low 
profile to ensure long-term success of reform. 
 
4.  (C)  The Minister told CDA that he has no objections to 
Hermina meeting with whomever he pleases in Bahrain.  He also 
has no objections to the ABA publicizing in its materials in 
the US that they have a project in Bahrain.  Al Arayed added 
that he and John have an excellent working relationship.  The 
Minister was pleased to inform Charge that, with Hermina\'s 
assistance, the MOJ will start recruiting judges by public 
announcement, and plans for establishing a legal training 
center are underway. 
 
5.  (C)  However, in conjunction with placing a public 
announcement for judge selection, Hermina told PolOff that 
the Minister of Justice refused to allow Hermina to contact 
any representative from the Bahrain Bar Society.  \"They are a 
bunch of crooks and you do not want to be exposed to those 
kinds of people,\" Al Arayed said.  Hermina said that Al 
Arayed\'s reasons for limiting his access changes from day to 
day. Al Arayed said it was impossible to establish an ABA 
office in Bahrain since ABA is not an NGO nor is it 
registered.  Hermina offered to apply to the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) to register.  Al Arayed 
responded that as an \"independent\" NGO, ABA would have no 
sponsorship from the MOJ. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT. This project is one of the few bilateral 
judicial reform projects derived from the Arab Judicial 
Forum.  Both sides have a stake in the project\'s success.  We 
believe the project\'s birthing pains are manageable, but it 
may take a significant investment of time to find ways for 
the ABA representative to achieve his objectives while 
meeting the Minister\'s concerns. In particular, we will have 
to find a creative way for Hermina to pursue his contacts in 
Bahrain.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: INSURANCE - BAHRAIN\'S NEXT FINANCIAL SECTOR GROWTH 
MARKET 
 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. Bahrain has targeted insurance as its next financial 
growth market.  It is revamping the regulatory regime to 
facilitate more competition and faster growth.  Bahraini 
sources relate that based on market penetration (two percent 
of GDP), Bahrain is the Arab World\'s largest and most 
sophisticated insurance market.  The insurance market enjoyed 
double digit growth in 2002.  Although desiring sector 
expansion, Bahrain is cautious about opening its local market 
to international competition.  The American Life Insurance 
Company is Bahrain\'s fifth largest local insurer, and one of 
two American insurance companies licensed in Bahrain. 
Islamic insurance and health insurance could be new products 
that expand customer base, but it will require a major 
marketing/awareness campaign to educate potential insurance 
consumers.  If Bahrain opens its market more fully, it could 
set an example for how the region as a whole could grow the 
insurance business.  Seizing that potential could drive 
foreign firms to do more advertizing, helping Bahrain expand 
its insurance market.   END SUMMARY. 
 
BAHRAIN\'S NEXT FINANCIAL FRONTIER 
 
2. Over the past year, BMA Governor Shaikh Ahmed bin Muhammad 
Al-Khalifa and his staff have repeatedly stated in public and 
in private meetings that the insurance sector is Bahrain\'s 
next financial frontier.  Shaikh Ahmed and other industry 
figures excited about the insurance industry\'s prospects in 
Bahrain and the region frequently cite a statistic that 
insurance market penetration in Bahrain is about two percent 
of GDP (USD 8.9 billion).  In more economies, they say, 
market penetration ranges between eight and thirteen percent. 
 Anwar al-Sadah, the BMA Executive Director charged with 
expanding Bahrain\'s insurance industry, and Samir al-Wazzan, 
President of the Bahrain Insurance Association, told POL/ECON 
Chief that although the insurance industry has barely 
scratched the market\'s potential within Bahrain, the country 
has the highest market penetration in the Arab World.  They, 
along with AIG\'s local representative, commented that 
Bahrain\'s more cosmopolitan and better-educated population is 
more receptive to insurance as an important component of 
family financial management.  This, they thought, makes 
Bahrain the best location for developing a regional insurance 
hub. 
 
3. Double digit growth for the sector provides another solid 
reason for optimism. According to the BMA\'s official 
statistics, 2002 gross premiums underwritten by both local 
(including the 10 foreign companies licensed to operate in 
the local market) and offshore insurance companies exceeded 
USD one billion, a 13 percent increase over 2001.  Bahrain\'s 
84 Offshore companies held 73 percent of the premium and 
contributed over 80 percent of this growth.  The offshore 
sector alone has grown nearly 50 percent in the past two 
years. 
 
OFFSHORE INVESTMENT WELCOME, BUT BMA RELUCTANT TO OPEN LOCAL 
MARKET 
 
4. According to al-Sadah, the BMA recognizes that it needs to 
open its domestic market, as well as promote offshore 
investment, to expand the sector.  However, the BMA wants to 
proceed carefully and selectively.  In the early 90\'s, 
Bahrain closed its domestic insurance market to foreign 
companies not already licensed here.  Bahrain\'s national 
companies have become accustomed to this protection and would 
need time to adjust to increased competition.  This, he said, 
explained Bahrain\'s not including insurance in the GATS 
market opening offers the GOB sent last year to the WTO. 
 
5. In two conversations with P/E Chief, Bahrain Insurance 
Agency President al-Wazzan has indicated the industry would 
not welcome market opening at this time.  He visibly blanched 
at the thought of AIG entering the market with its full line 
of products, claiming it would \"bury every local firm in the 
market.\"  Al-Wazzan received skeptically P/E Chief\'s news 
that Jordanian service companies had benefited from the 
competition fostered by its FTA with U.S.  However, he seemed 
receptive to P/E Chief\'s suggestion of exploring Jordan\'s 
post-FTA experience, welcoming the idea of inviting the 
President of Jordan\'s insurance association to Bahrain to 
address the industry on this topic. 
 
NEW PRODUCTS NEEDED TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS 
6. The major products in the local market are life, fire, 
auto, and marine insurance.  Together, they account for 84 
percent of gross premiums.  Market penetration will also need 
new products, according to al-Sadah, al-Wazzan, and Takaful 
International\'s Ahmed Janahi.  Like Islamic banking, they 
agreed, Takaful, or Islamic insurance, could attract devout 
Muslims to buy insurance.  Al-Wazzan, who was CEO of Bahrain 
Kuwait Insurance Company, put his own reputation and career 
behind this view, becoming General Manager of the 
newly-formed Solidarity Islamic Insurance and Re-insurance 
Company.  Al-Wazzan proudly told P/E Chief from his new 
office that Solidarity is the world\'s largest Islamic 
insurance company in terms of paid-in capital, USD 150 
million. 
 
7. At a more practical level, Takaful International CEO 
Janahi seems to be proving this point.  His company enjoyed 
100 percent growth from 2001 to 2002, with fire and life 
insurance leading the way.  Janahi told P/E Chief that he had 
to change the name of \"life\" insurance to \"family\" insurance 
to convince devout Muslims to buy policies.  According to 
Islam, he said, people cannot insure a life, only God can do 
that.  However, he said Muslims readily accept the concept of 
insuring a family\'s financial future against the unexpected 
death or disability of the primary breadwinner. 
 
8. Besides Takaful, industry reps believe health insurance 
could take off if the government requires private health 
insurance for all resident third country nationals working in 
the country (about 250,000 people).  The press has reported 
occasionally that the cabinet is reviewing the idea.  Private 
health care professionals in the country are hoping to see 
this law proposed.  According to two hospital general 
managers, the country has seen significant levels of 
investment in the health services sector but little growth in 
demand, mainly because the government remains the primary 
service provider in the country.  Our hospital administrator 
contacts consistently argue that a private health insurance 
requirement for third country nationals is absolutely 
necessary for the private health care business to grow. 
 
BMA MOVES TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY REGIME 
 
9. The BMA took over regulation of the insurance sector after 
the GOB enacted in May 2002 legislation consolidating 
regulation of the financial sector.  The BMA\'s al-Sadah told 
P/E Chief that the agency moved quickly to revamp the 
insurance industry\'s regulatory structure, hiring 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) London to draft a new law and 
regulations.  Al-Sadah stated that these regulations, 
developed over the next two years, will comply with 
international standards such as those specified in the core 
principles of the International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors.  According to introductory language from the 
first of the new regulations, which the BMA released in 
mid-April for public comment, the BMA hopes to align these 
regulations with those governing banks and the stock exchange 
to create a liberal and consistent regulatory framework that 
maximizes economic potential. 
 
10. The BMA reported that in 2002, it had licensed 156 
insurance companies and brokers to operate in Bahrain. 
Twenty of these companies are \"national\" insurance companies 
licensed to operate in the local market.  Eighty-four are 
offshore firms.  The balance are insurance brokers, 
syndicates, consultants, representative offices, loss 
adjusters, and actuaries. 
 
11. Based on the BMA\'s annual report, the American Life 
Insurance Company (ALICO, an AIG affiliate) is the only U.S. 
insurance company licensed to work in Bahrain\'s local market. 
 In terms of 2002 gross premiums ALICO ranks fifth in the 
domestic market with a nine percent market share.  It ranks 
second in the life insurance market (after Zurich 
International Life, ltd.) with a 46 percent market share. 
The BMA\'s report lists the Arabian American Insurance Co. as 
an offshore licensee. 
 
COMMENT 
 
12. Based on our conversations with the BMA and industry 
reps, it looks like the insurance sector has potential for 
growth for both offshore and local businesses.  The 
government\'s willingness to allow offshore investment while 
limiting competition in the local market is consistent with 
its practice in the banking sector.  However, the Bahraini 
public does not yet understand the concept of insurance very 
well.  At the same time, the GOB\'s leadership hopes that 
Bahrain\'s local market can set a positive example for the 
region that Bahrain can exploit before other regional 
competitors get into the game.  The BMA is trying to raise 
public awareness in Bahrain about the advantages of owning 
insurance policies, but its resources probably cannot support 
a mass market advertizing campaign.  On the other hand, 
private companies competing for business are usually willing 
to deploy significant resources to market their products and 
educate the public simultaneously.  This suggests that 
Bahrain should be thinking about more aggressively opening 
its local market to foreign competition.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  FTA round one produced remarkable progress.  Round two 
promises to be more difficult because negotiators will have 
to tackle sticky issues.  Eliminating physical presence 
requirements and disclosure of judicial decisions will likely 
require extensive revision of local laws.  Textiles, 
technology choice for telecommunications, duty-free market 
access for motor vehicles and patenting of animals will 
require resolution.  Jameel Al Alawi, Legal lead negotiator, 
told EMBOFFS that he had instructed negotiators to agree to 
FTA texts in principle only.  Yet overall, there is a strong 
push to conclude as many chapters as possible during round 
two.  IPR, financial services, and market access lead 
negotiators told ECONOFF that they did not want their groups 
to delay a June signing.  Ministry of Finance and National 
Economy\'s Yousif Humood, de facto coordinator for the 
Bahraini delegation, assured ECONOFF February 25 that 
schedules of negative lists requested during round one 
negotiations were being approved by the ministers responsible 
and would be ready for round two.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
Overarching Legal Issues 
------------------------- 
 
2.  Jameel Al Alawi, legal lead negotiator and Ministry of 
Cabinet Affairs Director of Agreements and Treaties, told CDA 
February 24 that Bahrain\'s negotiators are not necessarily 
legal experts and are sometimes unaware of changes that FTA 
provisions would require to existing laws.  Therefore, he has 
cautioned all lead negotiators that they may agree to texts 
in principle only.  Legal Affairs will need to check for 
conflicts between the text and existing laws.  Negotiators 
will have to obtain authorization from the relevant ministry 
or ministries to accept provisions that would require changes 
to Bahraini law. 
 
3.  Al Alawi Emphasized to CDA that it is much more difficult 
to change laws once drafted than to write them appropriately 
to begin with.  Reworking laws would require much time and 
GOB resources would be stretched.  He alerted CDA that many 
of the ministries lack legal advisors altogether, and that 
those advisors that are on staff are not always good enough, 
experienced enough, or have the appropriate specialty to 
draft good laws.  Specifically, Al Alawi said that many of 
Bahrain\'s legal advisers are Egyptians who are computer 
illiterate and lack sufficient English language skills to 
remain up-to-date.  When CDA suggested that the GOB ask for 
technical assistance funding to support (re-)drafting of laws 
to enact FTA, Al Alawi countered that the GOB had not had 
good experience with outsourcing legal advice, since lawyers 
thus procured tended to be unfamiliar with Bahraini law, 
tended to be commercially minded, and substituted 
cookie-cutter copying of other countries\' existing laws for 
drafting expertise.  (COMMENT:  Bahrain\'s Constitution was 
largely drafted by foreigners.  END COMMENT.) 
 
4.  Looking ahead, Al Alawi alerted CDA that there is a 
constitutional provision that allows for fast track enactment 
of laws of an \"important economic nature\".  This provision 
requires parliament to act on the draft within 15 days. 
(Note:  Al Alawi was not explicit about which article of the 
Constitution he was referring to.  Post is checking the 
constitution to verify the pertinent provision.  END NOTE.) 
 
--------------------------- 
Schedules of negative lists 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  Ministry of Finance and National Economy Director of 
Economic Planning Yousif Humood told ECONOFF February 25 that 
all the requested schedules (services, financial services, 
market access, government procurement) had been forwarded to 
the relevant ministerial-level authorities for approval.  He 
said he hoped to have them ready to pass to the U.S. side by 
February 26th to give U.S. negotiators the opportunity to 
study the lists. 
 
-------- 
Textiles 
-------- 
 
6.  Lead negotiator for textiles Haitham Al Gahtani told 
Senate Finance/Commerce Committee Staffdel visitors February 
21 that Bahrain will seek fabric-forward and TPL to allow 
time for a gradual, \"cooperative integration\" of the 
industry, with Bahrain moving away from ready-made garment 
production and developing in its place textile design, 
shipping and financing capabilities. 
 
7.  As in the U.S., textiles is a politically-charged issue 
here with real economic ramifications for segments of the 
population.  Textiles, comprising ready-made garments (80 
percent) and gray cloth (20 percent), are Bahrain\'s primary 
non-oil export to the United States.  While Bahrain\'s 
contribution to overall U.S. textile imports is negligible, 
Gahtani said, in Bahrain the sector represents at least 
10,000 jobs, including roughly 3,500 for less educated, hard 
to re-employ female Bahraini Shia.  The rise of the industry 
is attributed to foreign investors seeking to take advantage 
of the existing U.S. textile quota system; most of the 
industry is not expected to survive the end of quotas on 
December 31, 2004.  Some factories here may relocate to 
countries where labor is significantly cheaper, especially in 
East Africa, Asia, and the Indian sub-continent.  Direct and 
indirect impact of the loss of textile jobs in Bahrain would 
shock the local economy, Al Gahtani said.  It is widely 
feared that this shock would negatively affect political 
stability in Bahrain. 
 
------------------ 
Financial Services 
------------------ 
 
8.  The financial services group has been communicating by 
e-mail with U.S. negotiators, Dr. Abdulrahman Saif, financial 
services lead negotiator, told ECON February 25.  They sent a 
list of issues for clarification to their U.S. counterparts 
early this week and are waiting for a reply.  A February 26 
meeting is scheduled with the Minister to review and approve 
Bahrain\'s proposed financial services negative list in time 
for round two.  Abdulrahman Saif said that he had not yet 
received the U.S. negative list for financial services, but 
looked forward to discussing both sides\' offers at the 
negotiations. 
 
9.  Regarding discussions during round one of a moratorium 
limiting commercial banks in Bahrain to those 19 with 
existing licenses,  Abdulrahman Saif said that he considers 
this moratorium lifted, since over the last few years, five 
new licenses were issued.  Abdulrahman Saif told ECONOFF 
February 25 that he would check with his legal advisor to 
find out more details about this. 
 
10.  On insurance, Abdulrahman Saif stressed to ECONOFF 
February 25 that he expects a positive discussion of 
cross-border supply of insurance services.  Ghalib Hammoudi, 
AIG\'s local representative, has told EMBOFFS on numerous 
occasions that he is concerned about market access as 
provided for in the draft insurance law.  The draft law does 
not make provision for agents, AIG\'s principal way of doing 
business.  In addition, the BMA has not responded to AIG\'s 
application to expand its business lines to all insurance 
products.  AIG is in the process of applying to USDOC\'s 
advocacy center for USG and Embassy support. 
 
11.  Bahrain looks to bring Islamic banking, investment, and 
insurance to the U.S. market, particularly to serve the U.S. 
Muslim community, but also to attract non-Muslims looking for 
ethical investment products, CitiIslamic Bank\'s Raj Mittal 
told ECONOFF on numerous occasions.  Bahrain has become a 
global Islamic banking center by introducing regulations 
standards and creating new Islamic products.  Afaq Khan, Head 
of Islamic banking at Standard Chartered in Dubai and 
formerly at HSBC told ECONOFF February 25 that HSBC had had 
less than stellar results when it introduced Islamic home 
mortgages in New York State.  Because of the asset structure 
of Islamic mortgages, double-taxation (capital gains) and 
increased legal costs made the mortgages uncompetitive in the 
market.  In addition, when HSBC tried to expand their offer 
to Connecticut and New Jersey, they faced these legal 
challenges anew, producing limited positive outcomes. 
 
-------- 
Services 
-------- 
 
12.  Holidays and ministerial travel prevented a number of 
involved ministries from submitting their the services list 
of non-conforming measures in a timely fashion, Eman Al 
Doseri, Ministry of Commerce Head of Foreign Trade and 
International Organizations and a member of the services 
negotiating team told ECONOFF February 21 and again February 
24.  However, on February 25, Yousif Humood assured ECONOFF 
that the list was awaiting ministerial approval and should be 
ready for round two. 
 
13.  Current GCC non-conforming measures are based on current 
laws and regulations, Al Doseri said, so they might be 
difficult to change, especially since they involve other 
countries.  The Bahraini delegation will likely seek 
grandfathering.  (COMMENT:  In exchange for grandfathering 
these non-conforming measures, Bahrain may well be prepared 
to offer the United States treatment equal to that of GCC 
members.  END COMMENT.) 
 
14.  Further, on mode 3 supply of services, Al Doseri 
stressed that Bahrain\'s commercial law requires physical 
presence for Bahrainis as well as non-Bahrainis.  Yet, it is 
clear from anecdotal evidence that Bahrain does not restrict 
products from entering Bahrain through companies such as 
amazon.com or e-bay.  In fact, the Directorate of 
Publications and Press cited amazon.com to ECONOFF as one of 
the principal sources of parallel imports of Zone 1 DVDs (see 
Manama 249).  Local laws may need to be amended to conform 
with standard practice and to legalize cross-border supply, 
especially in light of Bahrain\'s eagerness to develop 
e-commerce opportunities. 
 
------------------ 
Telecommunications 
------------------ 
 
15.  Lead Telecommunications negotiator Sheikh Hamad bin 
Mohamed Al Khalifa told ECONOFF February 24 that he does not 
want the pace of telecoms liberalization, scheduled in the 
telecoms law for completion by the end of 2004, to hold up 
signing an FTA in June.  He is concerned that the U.S. side\'s 
understanding of the Bahraini licensing requirement for 
cross-border provision of telecoms services (e.g., 
long-distance, internet) is incomplete:  there is no pre-set 
limit on international licensing; a switch constitutes 
physical presence; Bahraini concern over cost-oriented 
interconnection revolves around the inability to enforce 
regulations on a non-licensed company that is providing 
services in Bahrain. 
 
16.  Issues subject to ongoing consultation by the 
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), such as number 
portability, are also of concern to Al Khalifa.  He said that 
including such provisions in the FTA pre-judges outcomes of 
the consultative process.  In exchange for \"greater 
understanding\" on the above issues, Al Khalifa is prepared to 
engage on the \"more substantive\" issue of technology choice 
for mobile operators. 
 
------------- 
Market Access 
------------- 
 
17.  Market access lead negotiator Hassan Ali Al Majed told 
ECONOFF February 21 that he had sent forward to USTR 
Bahrain\'s WTO list of prohibited items.  He said that Bahrain 
was prepared immediately to put up for consideration 92 
percent of U.S. trade with Bahrain, the initial offer would 
be subject to ministerial approval.  Al Majed said that the 
underlying reason for the auto exclusion is that there were 
already too many cars on this small island, causing traffic 
congestion and pollution, and that eliminating the 5 percent 
tariff would make cars affordable to many more potential 
owners.  Separately, a key Bahraini negotiator told CDA 
February 17 that import tariffs collected on imported 
vehicles is important to the Finance Ministry.  (COMMENT:  We 
would not be surprised if there were pressures from prominent 
Bahraini families who import non-American cars.  END COMMENT.) 
 
---------------------- 
Government Procurement 
---------------------- 
 
18.  The GOB is seeking clarifications as to whether existing 
government procurement laws meet FTA requirements and are 
waiting for requested documents from the U.S. negotiators to 
prepare offers.  Legal lead negotiator Jameel Al Alawi told 
CDA February 24 that one point of contention may be that 
Bahrain extends preferential treatment in government 
procurements to GCC suppliers. 
 
--- 
IPR 
--- 
 
19.  Bahrain will need to develop its enforcement laws, 
including establishing standardized and sufficiently punitive 
damages provisions for IPR infringements, Legal lead 
negotiator Jameel Al Alawi told CDA February 24.  He also 
mentioned to ECONOFF on numerous occasions over the past few 
weeks that Bahrain would have difficulty with the patenting 
of animals because the concept is inconsistent with the 
Islamic tenet that only God can create and destroy life.  He 
added that disclosure of judicial decisions is not normal 
modus operandi here generally.  Such a provision would 
require Bahrain to amend its laws. 
 
----- 
Labor 
----- 
 
20.  On Labor, lead legal negotiator Jameel Al Alawi expects 
Bahrainisation policies (i.e., industry-specific quotas for 
minimum percentages of Bahraini national employees applied at 
the company level) to present some problems in negotiation. 
He stressed to CDA February 24 that U.S. immigration policies 
and Bahrainisation are different means to the same end -- job 
protection for the local labor force.  An FTA, he said, aims 
for free movement of goods and services, not necessarily of 
people. 
 
------- 
Customs 
------- 
 
21.  In a February 24 discussion with CDA, Bahrain\'s lead 
legal negotiator Jameel Al Alawi wondered how the FTA would 
work on a practical level relative to the existing GCC 
customs union.  At present, re-export tariffs are levied at 
the border when goods exit Bahrain for another GCC country. 
However, beginning in 2005, the GCC customs union envisions a 
single point of entry, so that once goods have arrived in one 
GCC country, they can be transported freely within the GCC. 
A mechanism will have to be established to assure that goods 
arriving duty-free to Bahrain from the United States would 
not be re-exported duty-free throughout the GCC after FTA 
implementation.

SUBJECT: MANAMA\'S REQUEST FOR FY04 BFIF FUNDING 
 
REF: STATE 242589, 03 STATE 335536 
 
1. SUMMARY: Manama requests USD 7000 in funding from the 
FY04 Business Facilitation Incentive Fund (BFIF) to 
establish and equip a resource center for a new chapter of 
the American Chamber of Commerce in Bahrain. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. BACKGROUND: In FY03, BFIF supported AmCham Bahrain 
formation by funding visits from AmCham Cairo 
representatives to Bahrain to discuss the purpose and 
importance of an AmCham for the U.S. business community to 
reinforce and coalesce increase interest in the formation of 
an AmCham in Bahrain.  Later, BFIF funded U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce\'s John Howard\'s travel to Bahrain to work with a 
core AmCham formation committee on by-laws and a business 
plan for the group.  In consultation with John Howard, these 
documents have been revised.  The formation committee is now 
preparing translations of their by-laws and business plan to 
present to the Government of Bahrain.  Positive meetings 
with the GOB, including those with the AmCham delegation 
from Cairo as well as with John Howard, lead us to believe 
that GOB accreditation will be unproblematic.  The formation 
committee anticipates presenting its credentials to the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce this spring, and to be up and running 
soon thereafter. 
 
3. With bilateral Free Trade Agreement negotiations 
underway, U.S. business interest in Bahrain and Bahraini 
business interest in the U.S. has increased.  The 
seriousness of this interest is substantiated by requests 
for International Company Profiles (ICPs) and Gold Key 
Service not seen in previous years at this embassy.  A 
bilateral Free Trade Agreement should push this trend.  The 
new AmCham could augment Embassy matchmaking efforts through 
its own programs. 
 
4. Post requests funding to establish and equip an American 
Chamber of Commerce Resource Center in Bahrain.  The 
information-age Center could be a nexus for up-to-date 
matchmaking information searches, market research and 
industrial trends on a local and global level.  To assure 
that the AmCham is able to provide added value through 
current information beyond what is readily available to the 
average internet user, we are requesting an internet-ready 
laptop computer and printer together with subscriptions to 
online searchable data services.   These resources will give 
the members and visitors access to active tenders and 
project details in addition to commercial and economic news 
in the local, regional and global market.  The laptop, 
together with an all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machine and 
a projector can serve double duty, as AmCham office 
equipment to prepare brochures and invitations, and to make 
presentations designed to drive and inform membership.  We 
anticipate that these resources will contribute to making 
the AmCham Resource Center a destination for the business 
community in Bahrain.

SUMMARY 
 
1.(C)  A democratically inexperienced GOB is learning just 
how messy democracy can be.  Besides dealing with the 
boycotting opposition, both elected and appointed 
parliamentarians are challenging the government over alleged 
scandals and failures.  Sunni Islamists are asserting 
themselves in directions that are beginning to cause 
discomfort among Bahrain\'s ruling elite.  At least one senior 
official may be contemplating resignation because he doesn\'t 
enjoy public criticism.  On the other hand, top business 
leaders are beginning to criticize publicly some Islamist 
initiatives that business leaders think could harm business 
prospects.  Manama is a small place, and its crowded 
political circuits are starting to get hot.  Overall, the 
GOB\'s reaction appears to be one of slowing the pace of 
political reform.  This is having an impact on MEPI programs, 
requiring the Embassy to spend much more time than 
anticipated massaging the system to obtain positive program 
outcomes.  END SUMMARY 
 
GOB JEKYL OR HYDE ... WHICH ONE RULES TODAY? 
 
2.(C) Throughout the last three years of reforms, the GOB has 
often seemed to have a split personality.  The King has 
implemented a new constitution that provides some elements of 
democracy to the Bahraini people.  The Royal Court sponsors 
NDI\'s work in Bahrain and the King is driving force behind 
Bahrain\'s negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. 
The King has repeatedly stated that he welcomes proposals to 
amend the new constitution through the system detailed 
therein. The government usually has handled pressures from 
the boycotting opposition with tact and reserve.  The King 
has restrained his security forces, releasing and, when 
necessary, pardoning youths arrested for participating in 
violent demonstrations. 
 
3.(C) On the other hand, the Government has shown in recent 
months a tendency to regress to pre-reform behavior.  The 
government has intimidated meeting hall owners into canceling 
scheduled public political events.  In November, the GOB 
quickly moved to shut down the political satire \"Laysh Abu al 
Aysh\" (but ultimately failed as the opposition quickly 
erected an outdoor theater on a vacant lot).  Two weeks ago, 
it obstructed the holding a constitutional conference as 
reported ref B.  As we noted in this year\'s human rights 
report, press censorship and journalist self-censorship 
remain constant problems. 
 
PARLIAMENT, SUNNI ISLAMISTS ALSO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT 
 
4.(C) While trying to muzzle those who boycott the existing 
political system, the government is also grappling with the 
consequences of the political reforms to date.  The 
GOSI/Pension Fund investigation could very well lead to 
parliament\'s removal of a minister through a vote of 
no-confidence (ref C), and members who successfully uncovered 
the mismanagement of the pension funds have announced new 
investigations of corruption and mismanagement.  Meanwhile, 
Sunni Islamist deputies are spearheading a new effort to 
question the Information Minister about the production in 
Bahrain of a reality TV show in which six young unmarried 
Arab men are living in the same house with six unmarried 
young Arab women (septel).  Even the appointed upper house of 
Parliament, the Shura Council, is getting into the act.  It 
trashed the government\'s draft press law in favor of a more 
liberal version prepared by one of the Council\'s members. 
 
5.(C) Government officials, top business leaders, and ruling 
family members are beginning to complain that the GOB may 
have stepped into a real mess with political reform, and some 
are even blaming the USG. A top MFA official and 
well-connected member of the ruling family told Staffdel 
Clark on February 14 that he deeply resented Sunni Islamist 
activities to limit social freedoms saying there was no way 
he would allow religious conservatives to dictate his wife\'s 
choice of apparel.  A leading resterauteur and tourism 
promoter bitterly complained to P/E Chief about government 
constantly conceding to Islamist demands to restrict alcohol 
sales.  Meanwhile a top Finance Ministry official told Charge 
that the Finance Minister may resign soon because of the 
public criticism he has endured over the Pension Fund 
scandal.  According to our contact, the minister just doesn\'t 
want to deal with personal public criticism.  Vandals are now 
painting barbs on the walls of the minister\'s (luxurious) 
villa, this exasperated source exclaimed. 
REFORM PACE SLOWING? 
6.(C) We are seeing signs that the GOB is rethinking the pace 
at which it will implement reform.  Last Spring, PAS began 
actively recruiting a U.S. political scientist Fulbrighter to 
help the University of Bahrain found a new political science 
faculty and program.  When we succeeded and notified the 
university, we discovered that a political science program is 
no longer in the university\'s near term plans.  It took 
extensive work to obtain university approval to seat the 
Fulbrighter in the business school where he\'s going to teach 
a course on globalization only.  Similarly, when PAO recently 
previewed to our main reform-minded education ministry 
interlocutor new MEPI programs, he told her point blank that 
Bahrain is not ready for civic education in the schools.  He 
cautioned Bahrain could not move too fast. 
 
7.(C) Meanwhile, both MEPI-funded political program managers 
have reported to us that their GoB contacts are stressing the 
need to go slowly and carefully.  As noted ref A, the Justice 
Minister wants to \"low-profile\" the ABA technical assistance 
program because he has discovered opposition from Sunni 
Islamists within the ministry to American technical 
assistance to change the judicial system.  He wants to move 
forward, but not at the risk of a flank counterattack. 
Concurrently, the influential Minister of the Royal Court, 
Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, emphatically told NDI in 
January not to include a representative of the boycotting 
Shi\'a opposition party al-Wefaq in NDI\'s April Muslim 
democracies conference in Istanbul.  The NDI rep has also 
said that Shaikh Khaled would prefer that NDI made developing 
the democratic skills of the government and National Assembly 
NDI\'s top priority over training opposition political 
activists. 
 
COMMENT 
 
8.(C) The GOB is struggling at multiple levels to manage 
political reform while maintaining the political stability it 
needs to attract investment that creates jobs.  One one side, 
the boycotting opposition\'s desire for more radical political 
change and its refusal to participate challenge the new 
system\'s legitimacy.  On the other side, the new political 
system has produced an increasingly aggressive parliament 
intent on proving its relevance (and that of the new system) 
to the Bahraini people by bringing down a minister and 
pushing for more reform.  The Sunni Islamist bloc in the 
parliament is asserting itself in directions that are 
beginning to create discomfort among Bahrain\'s elite. The GOB 
appears to be responding by slowing the pace of, but not 
altering its commitment to, reform.  The GOB, we sense, wants 
time to find solutions.  As we inject MEPI programs into this 
mix, the GOB is responding more cautiously, and the Embassy 
must spend increasing amounts of time to work with MEPI 
contractors and the GOB to achieve positive program outcomes. 
 END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: KING HAMAD SUPPORTS REFORM IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 1/4(b)&(d). 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1.(C) Outgoing Arab League Chairman King Hamad bin Isa 
Al-Khalifa told U/S Grossman on March 2 that his Arab League 
Summit speech includes a paragraph supporting reform in the 
Middle East.  Noting that we are all one team, Hamad welcomed 
the U/S description of GME as supportive of local reform 
efforts, and highlighting the FTA negotiations, thanked the 
U.S. for its support of Bahrain\'s reform program.  The U.S. 
is right to raise the issue of reform now, he said.  Reform 
should not be held hostage to resolution of the Palestinian 
issue.  If we can obtain a public commitment for reform from 
regional leaders, the King suggested that they would not be 
able to retreat.  Successfully embedding democracy in Iraq, 
he said, would greatly strengthen stability in the region and 
increase prospects for democratization. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
BAHRAIN ON BOARD FOR GME 
 
2.(C) King Hamad enthusiastically welcomed the Greater Middle 
East Initiative and U/S Grossman\'s visit to consult on it. 
Hamad noted that friends, not enemies, provide advice, and if 
the advice is good, it should be embraced.  The GME 
initiative is timely, he added, especially after the U.N.\'s 
Arab Human Development Report alarmed many people that the 
region is falling behind the rest of the world.  Fortunately, 
Hamad proudly noted, the report ranks Bahrain number one in 
the region.  Proudly citing that Bahrain is negotiating an 
FTA with the U.S., he stated that we are all on one team and 
emphasized that Bahrain is ready to work together in any way. 
 Hamad thanked U/S Grossman for U.S. public statements 
highlighting Bahrain\'s reform programs, but commented that he 
has issued policy guidance to government officials to let 
Bahrain\'s progress speak for itself. 
 
3.(C) Hamad stressed that homegrown reform is a requirement 
for the region.  He welcomed U/S Grossman\'s statement that 
the purpose of GME is to position the U.S. to support Arab 
governments and people that want to change.  Hamad suggested 
that if we can get leaders to agree publicly to reform, they 
would not be able to retreat, especially in this era of 
modern media.  Hamad commented that many leaders are using 
the Palestinian situation as an excuse not to reform.  One 
day, he said, the Palestinians will find good leaders and 
achieve peace and their own state.  Then, he commented, those 
who have waited will have to scramble to stay ahead of 
popular demand for change.  People in Bahrain, he emphasized, 
are not waiting for the Palestinians to get their act 
together.  For us, Hamad said, the Palestinian issue is an 
indirect concern.  We need reform to respond to our direct 
need for business, investment, and jobs, he added.  The 
government\'s role is security, justice, and regulation; 
government should not dominate business. 
 
4.(C) King Hamad cautioned that Arab states are different and 
would reform at different speeds and towards different goals. 
 The key, he said, is that they are going in the right 
direction.  (COMMENT:  He was likely talking about Saudi 
Arabia.  END COMMENT).  Hamad welcomed more democracy in the 
Gulf.  Successful elections in neighbors like Iran and Iraq 
make Bahrain feel more secure. 
 
5.(C) Hamad, who is the outgoing Arab League Chairman, 
advised U/S Grossman that he has already included a statement 
of support for reform in his speech for the Arab League 
Summit.  He was pleased with U/S Grossman\'s description of 
our strategy to discuss building support for Middle East 
reform at the June G-8, US-EU, and NATO summits.  However, 
the Crown Prince commented that getting more than a general 
statement of support at the Arab League Summit would require 
considerable diplomatic effort. 
 
IRAQIS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
 
6.(C) Paraphrasing a newspaper editorial published last month 
by one of his close advisors, King Hamad noted that the U.S. 
presence in Iraq provides a terrific opportunity that if 
lost, could condemn Iraq to the sewer for ages.  He said that 
he is personally advising every Iraqi he meets to be patient 
and work with the U.S.  King Hamad added that stability in 
the region can only be achieved if a successful Iraqi 
democracy is established.  Otherwise, he added, local 
countries will always have to be on guard.

SUBJECT: MICRO-SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE STUDY 
 
REF: A) STATE 040341; B) STATE 40950 
 
1.  Post welcomes the micro-scholarships for English 
language study initiative outlined in reftel A.  This 
program will assist post in raising the English 
language abilities of an important target audience. 
 
2.  Post\'s outline of plans to start up this program in 
Bahrain follow: 
 
  --  Program administration/funding:  PAS Manama will 
  issue a grant totaling $18,000 to the American 
  Cultural and Educational Center (ACEC) to run this 
  program.  ACEC is a local, privately-owned and 
  operated English language center loosely affiliated 
  with the Embassy.  The Gulf RELO attends ACEC Board 
  meetings and we have had an English Language Fellow 
  placed at ACEC for each of the past three years. 
  One important caveat:  ACEC does not have a Dun and 
  Bradstreet number, which is now a requirement for 
  all Department-funded grants.  We will advise ACEC 
  to apply for the Dun and Bradstreet number and, upon 
  its issuance, make preparations to issue the grant. 
  The Dun and Bradstreet website advises that it takes 
  up to thirty business days for an organization to 
  receive their DUNS Number.  This will delay the 
  start up date for this program in Bahrain. 
 
  --  Academic content:  Post\'s exceptional junior 
  English Language Fellow has been offered a position 
  to remain at ACEC as Academic Director when her ECA- 
  funded Fellowship ends in June 2004.  Post will 
  request that she be primarily responsible for the 
  micro-scholarships program, including the academic 
  content, enrichment activities, and other 
  requirements during its start-up and implementation 
  phase.  Post appreciates the ability to provide ACEC 
  with some of the in-country staff costs ($120 per 
  student as stipulated in reftel A), as it provides 
  us with the necessary leverage to ensure that the 
  program will be well-run. 
 
  --  Selection:  Post will work with ACEC to select 
  students from up to four secondary schools (two 
  boys\' schools and two girls\' schools) that have a 
  concentration of non-elite, socio-economically 
  disadvantaged students.  We need to request 
  permission from the Ministry of Education to offer 
  the scholarships and then develop a selection 
  process in cooperation with the Ministry - or the 
  selected schools, per guidance from MinEd.  The RELO 
  and/or the APAO will represent the Ambassador on the 
  selection committee for these scholarships. 
 
  --  Micro-scholarship \"calculations\":  The cost of a 
  six week course at ACEC totals $305, which includes 
  all coursebooks and student materials.  This 
  reflects the high cost of living in the Gulf and 
  Bahrain (e.g., high teacher salaries, facilities 
  rent and maintenance, and utilities/air 
  conditioning).  As a result, the $18,000 allotment 
  transferred to post in reftel B will provide 
  approximately 13-14 scholarships for approximately 
  eight to nine months of study. 
 
  --  Materials:  Post looks forward to receiving 
  ECA\'s English-in-a-box teaching materials to pass to 
  ACEC to assist with the curriculum development of 
  this program.  Please advise ASAP when these and 
  other appropriate materials will be available.  ACEC 
  continually requests materials from post and we 
  regularly provide Department produced materials. 
  ACEC would welcome enhancement materials such as 
  graded readers, posters, paperback novels, U.S. 
  maps, biographies of American leaders, and U.S. and 
  state flags.

REF: A. MANAMA 272 
 
     B. MANAMA 269 
 
1. Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) insurance regulators are 
looking carefully at the possibility of opening the local 
insurance market to U.S. competitors 24-30 months after an 
FTA entes into force, BMA Governor Shaikh Ahmed bin Muhammad 
Al-Khalifa told Charge on March 8.  Small local brokers, he 
continued, will need an adjustment period to prepare for 
competition with large American entrants to the market. 
Given his responsibility for protecting local business in the 
financial sector, Shaikh Ahemd said he has no choice but to 
provide some transition period for local industry. 
 
2. Shaikh Ahmed added that he is adopting the same philosophy 
with respect to new legislation and regulations he expects to 
come on line this summer.  The BMA is currently revising 
legislation governing the sector as part of an overarching 
central bank law governing the regulation of all financial 
institutions in Bahrain.  The law, which was drafted with the 
assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, follows the 
British FSA and Singaporean regulatory models of having a 
generally-worded law supported by a very specific set of 
central bank issued regulations.  Shaikh Ahmed said some 
regulations have been drafted and circulated to BMA licensees 
for comment.  At the end of the process, he said, Bahrain 
will have expanded from meeting three IIS standards to 17. 
Once the laws and regulations enter into force, Shaikh Ahmed 
said he intends to give the BMA\'s licensees six months to 
implement the new rules. 
 
3.  Shaikh Ahmed provided us with copies of the new 
regulation consultation papers submitted to the BMA\'s 
licensees, and promised to forward an English copy of the 
draft central bank law to the Embassy as soon as possible. 
Post will forward the consultation papers to USTR via e-mail 
and send the law as soon as it is received.

1.(C)  SUMMARY.  Bahraini NGO representatives welcomed on 
March 3 any initiatives that would implement real democratic 
reforms in Bahrain, stated that we need to reach a common 
definition of democratic and human rights goals, and briefed 
U/S Grossman on several persistent problems.  They praised 
the 2003 Human Rights Report, but asked for more from the 
U.S. on human rights than reports.  They noted that Bahrain 
could improve its record on discrimination, poverty, 
education, freedom of expression, independence of NGOs, and 
the right to change Bahrain\'s government.  Failure to address 
these problems could lead to new instability and unrest, they 
said.  The NGO leaders voiced distrust of U.S. democracy 
initiatives because of U.S. support for Israel and public USG 
support for what they perceive as inadequate GOB reforms to 
date.  U/S Grossman stressed that our public support does not 
mean Bahrain\'s society should remain static, rather, the USG 
seeks to assist the people and governments of the region that 
wish to implement change.  Emphasizing that the USG has no 
blueprint for particular reforms countries must adopt, U/S 
Grossman encouraged active participation from civil society 
groups, believing that the best ideas for human rights reform 
come from the people.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
NGOs ACKNOWLDEGE PROGRESS, CITE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.(C)    Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) Vice 
President and former political exile Abdulhadi Al Khawaja 
agreed that we shared the same objective - promotion of human 
rights and democracy.  We share a vision that Bahrain should 
become a model for the region.  Al-Khawaja praised the 2003 
Report on Human Rights Practices in Bahrain, but said that 
the human rights community in Bahrain is looking for more 
from the U.S. than reports.  Al-Khawaja asserted that there 
are three main problems affecting daily life of Bahrainis -- 
poverty deriving from unemployment and discrimination (Al 
Khawaja said that 160,000 Bahrainis live in poverty), 
marginalization of opposition political groups (especially 
Shi\'a political leaders), and lack of an elected premier.  He 
complained that the same people have been running the country 
since independence in 1970.  Shura Council member and labor 
activist Faisal Fulad noted that existing labor laws do not 
meet International Labor Organization standards on 
discrimination and protection of foreign labor.  Bahrain 
Society for Public Freedoms and Democracy Watch Founder Nizar 
Al Qari (a former exilee and torture victim) added that 
President Bush mentioned Bahrain in several speeches, giving 
the GOB credit for promoting democracy, but NGOs on the 
ground can tell you that there has been no recent progress. 
Al-Khawaja warned that the unrest and instability experienced 
in the 90\'s could return if these problems remain 
unaddressed. 
 
3.(C) Bahrain Women\'s Society (BWS) and International Visitor 
Program alumnus Wajeeha al-Baharna stated that Bahrain had 
witnessed a surge of NGO formation in response to reform, but 
NGOs remain under the thumb of the Labor Ministry.  For 
instance NGOs must report to the ministry any member\'s 
participation in international NGO events.  Newly elected BWS 
president and IV program alumnus Dr. Soroor Qarooni, M.D., 
said the GOB does not take NGOs seriously, and complained 
that religious conservatives in the government use their 
influence to block licenses for and activities of NGOs. 
 
4.(C) Agreeing with Shura Council member Fulad, Wajeeha 
Al-Baharna stated that there is serious need to reform the 
education system which she asserted is in \"the Middle Ages.\" 
She charged that the schools do not teach the fundamentals, 
that students graduating from secondary school know nothing, 
and the introduction of new subjects is lacking.  Responding 
to NEA A/DAS Alina Romanowski\'s question, Al-Baharna 
complained that the Ministry of Education refuses to involve 
NGOs or parents in shaping education curricula and charged 
that the ministry pressures schools not to allow NGOs to help. 
 
5.(C)  Youth activist and former member of the University of 
Bahrain (UOB) Student Council Dua\' Al Masae\'d claimed that 
the UOB is not interested in hearing student views.  The UOB 
demanded a public apology from her when she dared to inquire 
about the selection terms for graduate school scholarships. 
Following promulgation of Bahrain\'s new constitution, Dua\' 
tried to organize a seminar for law students to discuss the 
constitution\'s legal implications.  She said UOB officials 
prevented its convening on campus and she charged that UOB 
administration delayed her graduation for trying to hold the 
seminar off campus. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
USG FOREIGN POLICY - THE \"DOUBLE STANDARD\" PREVENTS TRUST 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
6.  (C)  BCHR VP Al Khawaja responded to U/S Grossman\'s 
briefing on GME that it is time for the US to renew its 
foreign policy.  He calmly and firmly suggested that the US 
should not be calling on Bahrain to increase human rights and 
democracy when it supports a violator of human rights - 
Israel.  This double standard makes the US agenda in the 
region unclear and in no way fosters trust, he claimed. 
 
7.(C) In response, U/S Grossman said that the President has 
cited Bahrain as an example of a country where there have 
been some reforms.  This support does not mean that we think 
Bahrain\'s society can or should remain static.  No society in 
the world, including the U.S., can remain static.  The US is 
not interested in designing a mechanism for NGOs to implement 
and has no blueprint on how to accomplish democratic reforms, 
said U/S Grossman. Initiatives like GME and MEPI are vehicles 
to support to local voices for change.  NGOs, he said, fill a 
vital space between the people and the government.  BCHR 
President Nabeel Rajab said that NGOs welcome real human 
rights projects here in Bahrain.  However, we need to come up 
with a common definition of democracy and human rights goals.

2.  Nemat Ali said that Bahrain\'s CAA is very favorably 
disposed to joining MALIAT, since liberalization increases 
efficiency, and would carefully study the documents 
presented.  Once CAA comes to a formal decision to join 
MALIAT, they will pass the documents to the Cabinet Ministry 
Legal Affairs Directorate for review. Nemat Ali further 
intends to propose to his BGC Beirut counterparts that 
Lebanon join MALIAT, too.  If they agree, the two countries 
can together begin recruiting other Arab countries to join as 
well, Nemay Ali said.  (NOTE: To facilitate approval and 
regional recruitment, ECONOFF subsequently forwarded 
documents electronically.  END NOTE). 
 
3. Director Nemat Ali told ECONOFF March 9 that the Bahraini 
delegation to the Regional Summit on Aviation Safety and 
Security in Amman in February found the summit so useful that 
Bahrain would like to host the next regional summit.

SUBJECT: NO SIGN OF MOVEMENT ON ARTICLE 98 RATIFICATION 
 
REF: KANESHIRO - FORD EMAIL OF MARCH 9 
 
Classified By: Charge Robert S. Ford.  Reasons 1.4 (D). 
 
 1.  (C)  Charge asked Bahraini MFA Minister of State on 
March 8 and the Foreign Minister on March 9 whether the GoB 
had determined how it wanted to move forward with 
implementing our signed Article 98 agreement.  The Minister 
of State said the MFA lawyers still have not determined what 
legal means are available.  The MinState said the GoB wanted 
to be very careful not to create unnecessary issues with the 
Parliament.  Charge noted that the MFA\'s legal team had been 
examining this question since last summer.  He asked when we 
could expect a response given our anxious desire to finish 
the steps to implementing the agreement.  The MinState 
declined to give a date but emphasized that under no 
circumstances would the Bahraini Government ever transfer an 
American servicemember to the International Criminal Court. 
The FM March 9 also declined to give Charge a sense of when 
the GoB would tell us when it would finish its procedures. 
He merely said we would hear back soon. 
 
2. (C) Comment:  It is extremely unlikely that the GoB would 
transfer an American servicemember to the ICC or a third 
party; the bilateral military relationship is absolutely 
essential to Bahrain\'s security.  That said, it seems 
unlikely that we will, in fact, hear back soon about bringing 
the Article 98 formally into effect.  It is possible that the 
MFA lawyers think the agreement should go to Parliament, and 
the GoB doesn\'t want to send it given how feisty the 
Parliament has been on other issues.  It also is possible 
that the MFA lawyers are studying the question to death.  In 
any case, we could remain in this holding pattern for a long 
time.  Charge called on the Foreign Minister by coincidence 
on the same day that NEA PDAS Larocco raised this subject 
with the Bahraini Ambassador in Washington.  We will press 
the MFA in a couple weeks to learn if the GOB has made a 
decision to bring the signed Article 98 agreement into force. 
 If they still have not, we would then recommend that (a) we 
provide a letter from the appropriately senior American 
official that we could deliver to the Foreign Minister, or 
(b) a higher level American official convoke the Bahraini 
ambassador in Washington to underline the urgency to the USG.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN\'S FTA TA REQUESTS: POST INPUT 
 
REF: A. BAHRAIN\'S 3/5 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL 
 
     B. MANAMA 272 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT: In anticipation of the March 11 
interagency meeting to discuss FTA-related technical 
assistance priorities for Bahrain, post is submitting our 
prioritized A-basket (30-60-day timeframe) shortlist to 
contribute an on-the-ground perspective to the meeting. In 
prioritizing this A-list, post has focused on projects 
falling into the top three areas where the Bahrainis have 
stated that technical assistance is needed: 1) drafting of 
legal texts; 2) enforcement procedures; and 3) training of 
personnel, and on projects that could be implemented quickly 
with readily apparent results.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
1. Drafting of legal texts: Begin across-the-board assistance 
to review existing legislation and draft legal texts to 
comply with the requirements of the agreement (as noted on 
Page 1, item 1).  This is necessary to expedite Bahrain\'s 
readiness to bring the FTA into force and to implement the 
agreement. (NOTE: As described in ref B, this assistance will 
need to be provided delicately, since there are sensitivities 
resulting from not entirely satisfactory experiences with 
foreign legal assistance. END NOTE.)  This assistance should 
include review of proposed IPR legislation (Basket B, Item 4). 
 
2. Transparency mechanism/e-commerce/e-government: Although 
not listed among Bahrain\'s requests, Post is convinced that 
Bahrain needs to develop a modern mechanism to enhance 
participation in the development of laws and notification of 
legislative changes.  We propose the development of a website 
that would include a comment/consultation mechanism for draft 
legislation, electronic notification (vice the printed 
gazette) of new legislation, and a searchable electronic 
register of existing legislation (also in English 
translation). 
 
3. Customs: Implementation-related technical assistance, 
especially with respect to the rules of origin, risk 
assessment and technology for customs inspections (Basket A 
Item 4).  Bahrain will need to develop a mechanism to deal 
with re-imports of U.S. products from other GCC countries as 
well as re-exports of U.S. products into other GCC countries 
by January 1, 2005, when the GCC Customs Union single point 
of entry mechanism is scheduled to take effect. 
 
4. Environment: Adopt-A-School-Bus program--retrofitting 
particulate filters onto school bus diesel exhaust systems. 
This project emerged from consultations with 2003 EPA Embassy 
Science Fellows from USEPA Sector 6, which has experience 
with the Adopt-A-School-Bus program.  Active coordination 
between the Bahrain Environmental Authority and USEPA Sector 
6 means that this program could be up and running fast--as 
soon as funding is made available--and we would see clear, 
positive results. 
 
5. Labor/Textiles: Active bilateral coordination is 
developing ideas for useful assistance programs.  It would be 
wise to reserve some funding to be able to quickly fund 
initial projects (e.g., a possible study of alternative 
employment options for garment workers, development of 
retraining program descriptions) as they emerge from this 
dialog, especially because this politically important issue 
impacts Bahrain\'s stability. 
 
6. IPR Enforcement: Technical assistance on the 
identification and development of Bahrain\'s enforcement 
procedures, as well as staff exchange training of IPR staff 
and the staff involved in the enforcement process in customs, 
the judiciary, and police (Basket A, Item 5).  The GOB has 
demonstrated consistently the will to enforce IPR protection. 
Bahrain\'s principle weakness is that the staff on the ground 
and the courts are insufficiently familiar with IPR to always 
make good decisions.  This is an area where we could move 
quickly and have visible impact that would be appreciated by 
the U.S. and Bahraini business communities. 
 
7. SPS: Begin technical assistance in strengthening, 
surveillance, control, monitoring and enforcement of 
standards and procedures in order to ensure the quality and 
safety of imported and locally manufactured foods  (Basket B, 
Item 8).  Bahrain has committed to revised shelf-life 
standards and non-ICCP standards. We could reward this stance 
by helping the Bahrainis quickly develop an alternate system 
that will work for them.

SUBJECT: ISLAMISTS PULL THE PLUG ON TV SHOW DESPITE 
BUSINESS OUTCRY 
 
REF: 03 MANAMA 2686 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert Ford.  Reasons:  1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  In the latest in a string of recent 
victories, Bahraini Islamists earlier this month compelled 
the Middle East Broadcasting Channel 2 (MBC 2) reality 
television show \"Big Brother\" to halt its production in 
Bahrain.  The show\'s production team left Bahrain despite 
public support for the production from Bahrain\'s usually 
timorous business community.  Businessmen are complaining 
about the lack of GOB support for the production, and the 200 
jobs that came with it; they complain that the GOB\'s retreat 
on Islamists\' social policy demands are damaging Bahrain\'s 
business climate.  The production\'s closure and other 
Islamist agitation could hurt Bahrain; one prominent U.S. 
company told us earlier this week that Bahrain\'s political 
climate appears less stable than Qatar and the UAE and hence 
it is less attractive as a regional base.  We cannot explain 
the GOB\'s apparent acquiescence to Sunni Islamist demands 
when the King has the political tools to block their 
initiatives.  Some Bahraini businessmen are beginning to 
fight back.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
BIG BROTHER GETS GOB BLESSING 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On February 21, Saudi owned MBC 2 launched its 
Middle Eastern version of the reality show \"Big Brother.\" 
Based on the original Dutch show, 12 female and male 
contestants were filmed 24 hours per day living in a house. 
By group vote these 12 participants would decide whom to kick 
out of the house and off the show until only one \'winning 
contestant\' was left.  MBC 2 altered the show\'s format to 
conform to Bahrain\'s Arab and Islamic culture by segregating 
the male and female contestants and having them only interact 
in the communal areas.  Only after format alterations did the 
Minister of Information Nabeel Al Hamer give the go ahead for 
the project to be based on Bahrain\'s tourist island of Amwaj, 
according to press reports.  (COMMENT:  Rumors abound that Al 
Hamer was one of Bahrain\'s leading investors in the project. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SUNNI ISLAMISTS CHASE BIG BROTHER FROM BAHRAIN 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (U)  Even with alterations to the show\'s format, 
parliamentary conservatives attacked Minister Al Hamer for 
failing to keep his promise to maintain strict Islamic 
values.  Sunni conservative and Al Minbar Islamiyya (Muslim 
Brotherhood) member MP Shaikh Mohammed Khalid proposed that 
an investigative committee look into the motives of the 
Minister.  Along with five others MPs, Salafi leader and 
Second Vice Chairman of the Council of Representatives (COR) 
MP Adel Al Moawda called for questioning the Information 
Minister, the first step towards a vote of no confidence and 
removal of a minister from office. 
 
4.  (C)  According to the press, conservative religious 
leaders outside parliament ramped up the rhetoric, declaring 
the show \"rampant moral depravity.\"  Friday sermons at the 
end of February and into early March warned parents of the 
show\'s \"dangerous implications\" and reprimanded Minister Al 
Hamer for failing to keep Bahrain \"clean.\"  Sunni 
conservatives organized a public protest at which about 1000 
protesters attempted to make their way to the filming site. 
Smaller protests occurred in downtown Manama and other 
locations.  MBC 2 announced on March 3 that it was stopping 
production in Bahrain and withdrawing its production team. 
It laid off 200 workers, including 85 Bahrainis, according to 
press reports.  The show,s assistant producer told Poloff 
last week that the rumor on the set was that the Government 
told MBC 2 to halt the production.  MBC 2,s public statement 
made no reference to Government involvement in the decision 
in order to preserve appearances of network freedom, she 
alleged.  (Comment:  We have no confirmation yet from other 
sources of GOB involvement in the decision.  End Comment.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
THE GOB\'S PRE-EMPTIVE CAPITULATION POLICY 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The successful campaign against the TV show is the 
latest in a string of recent victories Bahraini Islamists 
have gained to enforce more conservative social norms in 
Bahrain.  In December 2002, the Commerce Minister severely 
restricted alcohol sales in response to press from the 
Islamist block in the elected chamber of the Parliament (the 
Islamists are the largest block with 17 of the 40 
representatives).  In June 2003, conservatives were 
successful in passing a bill through the COR to ban the sale 
of alcohol to Muslims.  (The Parliament\'s upper chamber, the 
Shura Council never acted on the legislation, thus blocking 
its passage into law.)  In the following month, the King 
allowed fully-veiled women to drive, despite the Shura 
Council\'s overwhelming rejection of a COR sponsored bill 
authorizing the same.  According to the press, the royal 
decision followed a private meeting between the King and 
Salafi leader Al Moawda.  The GOB has also aggressively 
closed hotels and clubs for allegedly violating GOB 
limitations on alcohol sales and entertainment. 
 
---------------------------------- 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY PROTESTS FIZZLE 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Angered by the cancellation of the show, prominent 
businessman and Big Brother investor Farouq Al-Moayed 
lambasted the six conservative members of Parliament for 
demanding the cancellation of the show.  He remarked to the 
press that the debate about the show will have a negative 
impact on foreign investment.  Along these lines, an American 
oil company executive visiting the Gulf told RSO on March 8 
that American firms operating in the region have started to 
notice the Islamist protests and restrictive social policy 
initiatives.  They compare this agitation with the quiet in 
places like Qatar and the UAE, he commented.  Bahrain does 
not fare well in this comparison, he concluded, and no 
American firms are likely to choose to put a new regional 
base in Bahrain instead of a country judged quote more stable 
end quote. 
 
7.  (C)  Commenting on the negative effect the Islamists have 
inflicted on Bahrain\'s economy, dynamic young business leader 
Sofyan Al-Moayed asserted to Poloff March 7 that tourism is 
down 40 percent over last year\'s levels.   Chairman of the 
Bahrain Businesswomen\'s Society Afnan Al Zayani (Information 
Minister al-Hamer\'s wife) told PolOff on March 7 that in 2001 
and 2002 hotels were at 106 percent occupancy.  However for 
New Year\'s 2003 and Eid holidays, hotels were only 30 percent 
occupied.  Another leading businessman described the 2004 Eid 
al-Adha holiday to us as a \"business disaster.\" 
 
8.  (C)  Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry board 
member Jawad Habib Jawad asserted that hotel occupancy is 
tied to alcohol consumption, which is way down.  An American 
Express executive confirmed this impression to P/E Chief on 
March 7.  He said that GCC tourists who used to come to 
Bahrain are now filling Dubai\'s and Doha\'s hotels.  Another 
prominent American businessman complained that Bahrain\'s 
clubs are now serving liquor in teapots, just like in Kuwait. 
 A Microsoft executive quipped that because of the limited 
availability of alcohol, entertainment companies are 
importing more prostitutes into Bahrain. 
 
9.  (C)  Leading businessman Abdul Hammed Kooheji commented 
angrily to PolOff on March 8 that the GOB is allowing 
Islamists to run the country, and they are running it into 
the ground.  He added that the Islamists will attack 
businessmen personally as well as their companies.  Thus, he 
lamented, there is little the business community can do to 
fight the conservatives.  Bahrain Businessmen\'s Association 
President Khaled al-Moayed told us March 6 that while Bahrain 
is negotiating a FTA to encourage more foreign investment 
from the U.S. and other countries, conservative Islamists are 
threatening Bahrain\'s reputation as a relatively open, 
moderate society hospitable to a variety of cultures.  When 
PolOff asked members of the Bahrain\'s Businessmen\'s 
Association why there are so few businessmen active in 
politics, Khalid Al-Moayed answered that the business 
community is too fearful to cross the Islamists, who in turn 
are too ignorant to make intelligent policy decisions.  So 
far, Al-Moayed said, the business community is too dignified 
to run for parliamentary office to confront the Islamist 
parliamentary bloc through the ballot box.  Separately, 
Khalid\'s son, Sofyan al-Moayed, told us March 7 that few 
Bahraini businessmen would confront the Islamists for fear 
the Islamists would organize a boycott of their Bahraini 
companies.  The Islamists are large and dangerous, he 
observed. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  We do not sense in any way that stability in 
Bahrain is under threat, but we do sense much greater 
Islamist assertiveness - a conclusion underlined to us by 
Central Bank Governor Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed last week as 
well.  Emboldened by the GOB\'s decision not to confront their 
social initiatives, Bahrain\'s Islamists have begun 
articulating an even more ambitious agenda, calling for the 
segregation of cinemas, the censorship of films, and the 
banning of alcohol sales.  They are on record in support of 
segregating men and women at the University of Bahrain.  We 
are uncertain why the King continues to retreat in the face 
of Sunni Islamist pressure.  He could easily rely on the more 
liberal-minded Shura Council and the cabinet to block Sunni 
Islamist legislative initiatives.  Regardless, the outcry 
from the business community against the pressure on MBC 2\'s 
TV show is the first time anyone in Bahrain\'s society has 
criticized the impact of Islamist \"reforms\" directly.  Shura 
Council member and Amwaj Properties General Manager Jameel 
al-Matrouk told P/E Chief on March 9 that he is planning a 
major anti-Islamist media blitz for next week.  Big Brother 
has left Bahrain, but its departure may have awakened 
Bahrain\'s business community to the challenge posed by the 
Sunni Islamist political agenda.  END COMMENT.

18.  Overview of Bahrain\'s Activities to Eliminate TIP: 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
A.  Bahrain is a destination country for TIP.  There are no 
official reports of trafficking within Bahrain\'s borders. 
There are no reliable estimates on the magnitude of the 
trafficking problem, but there are approximately 210,000 
expatriate workers in Bahrain (out of a total workforce of 
approximately 330,000).  At present, the most reliable 
sources of information are local embassies and the GOB, but 
none of these sources follows trafficking closely.  For this 
reporting period, 50 Filipino housemaids sought refuge at the 
Philippine Embassy from abusive employers.  The press 
reported 20 cases of housemaid abuse, which included 3 
suicides and the murder of an employer by her Ethiopian 
housemaid.  Local NGOs offer anecdotal reports of varying 
quality.  Even less reliable are reports from international 
NGOs (e.g. \"The Protection Project\"), none of which have 
representatives in Bahrain.  Those most at risk for 
trafficking include male laborers and female domestic 
workers.  Both men and women are subject to withholding of 
documents, alteration of contracts, and non-payment of 
salaries.  One local embassy official reported that 
alteration of contracts for laborers and domestics upon 
arrival in Bahrain is \"routine\" but his analysis seemed to be 
based more on anecdotes than on any systematic method of 
information collection.  Women, particularly those employed 
as domestics, are more susceptible to physical abuse, 
including instances of rape.  All sources Post contacted 
agreed that the sex industry in Bahrain is overwhelmingly 
voluntary.  Post has no information that children are at risk 
for trafficking to Bahrain. 
 
B.  Given the lack of reliable data, determining the source 
countries of trafficking victims is difficult.  However, 
given the large pools of workers from India, Pakistan, Sri 
Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, these are the most 
likely source countries.  Other Asian countries, such as 
China or Indonesia may also be involved.  Some victims may 
also come from the states of the former Soviet Union, 
Morocco, or Ethiopia. 
 
C.  The lack of reliable data makes it difficult to assess 
changes of the flow of trafficking to Bahrain.  There is some 
data on changes in the flow of workers in general, which may 
or may not be representative of changes in the flow of 
trafficking victims. There is no available information that 
indicates that anything has changed since 2002.  In terms of 
numbers, however, the volume of laborers and domestic workers 
from South and Southeast Asia is far greater than workers 
from China and the former Soviet Union. 
 
D.  Pending official notification of funding approval, IOM 
plans to conduct the first professional survey on trafficking 
as part of a project that will also train GOB officials and 
local NGOs to combat trafficking. 
 
E.  The majority of low and unskilled expatriate workers 
coming to Bahrain are subject to withholding of documents 
(especially passports) by their sponsors.  Holding passports 
is against the law; however it has become customary practice 
to do so.  Bahraini sponsorship agreements require that 
sponsors take full responsibility for their imported workers, 
including medical care and a return ticket to their home 
country.  In the case of domestic workers, a sponsor may not 
import a second person until he can prove that the first one 
has left Bahrain.  Consequently, sponsors feel compelled to 
have control over worker movements, particularly of their 
domestic workers.  Fearing the consequences of runaway, 
injured, or pregnant housemaids, sponsors in some instances 
refuse unaccompanied excursions from the household or 
compound.  Another widespread abuse is the demand by sponsors 
for money before returning passports for travel or other 
purposes. 
 
The two sectors most vulnerable to trafficking are 
construction and domestic work.  Up to half of low and 
unskilled expatriate workers coming as construction or other 
laborers are subject to contract substitution.  One embassy 
described this practice as \"routine,\" but it is not clear 
that this embassy had collected the information necessary to 
reach such a categorical conclusion.  Workers that have 
agreed to certain contract terms before leaving their home 
country find that they are presented with different contract 
conditions upon arrival.  Promised salaries of 140 BD (USD 
370) per month often become 70-80 BD (USD 185-212). 
Sometimes promised housing is not provided, or the housing 
provided is unsanitary.  In most cases, workers have little 
choice but to accept the new contract/conditions as they have 
debts to repay, both to recruiting agents and for 
transportation to Bahrain.  For construction workers, these 
costs can be USD 1200 or more.  Contract substitution is 
often due to the duplicity of recruiting agents in the home 
country.  These unscrupulous recruiting agents promise a 
worker that he or she will receive a particular contract when 
they know that the terms of this contract will be changed 
once the worker enters Bahrain. Nevertheless, Bahraini 
sponsors are also known to make changes to promised salaries 
claiming that workers have misrepresented their 
qualifications.  Post has no hard evidence to assess which of 
these scenarios happens more frequently.  Two housemaids 
alleged to the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights Migrant 
Workers Group (MWG) that two recruitment agencies make it a 
practice to rape incoming housemaids to  break them in, for 
employers. The MWG forwarded this information to the GOB in 
October 2003 and requested that the agencies be shut down. 
The Government has not yet responded to Post,s follow-up on 
the closure of the two agencies. 
 
Victims can take their case to Bahrain Labor Court but the 
process can be very long (from months to years) and most 
victims need their salary to survive and/or support relatives 
in their home countries.  The MWG is tracking over 200 free 
visa cases, some of which have languished in the courts for 
more than 2 years.  The lawyer representing these foreign 
workers refused to provide us details of these cases, citing 
attorney-client privilege. Often complainants withdraw their 
cases because they cannot continue to rely on the generosity 
of charitable NGOs or the MWG to share their personal homes 
for months at a time. 
 
J.    Expatriate workers have successfully sued Bahraini 
sponsors in the Labor Court.  The GOB provided Post with 
2000-2002 data on foreign worker complaints that were 
forwarded to Labor courts for resolution.  However, the 
Government did not provide any data on prosecutions. 
 
The situation of domestic workers differs from other laborers 
as they are usually placed without a formal contract.  They 
are often promised salaries of 50-60 BD per month or higher 
(USD 130-160) but receive only 40 BD (USD 106).  This salary 
varies, however, depending on the country of origin of the 
housemaid:  Filipinas are among the best paid (up to 70 
BD/month).  Indonesians and Sri Lankans, who lack diplomatic 
representation in Bahrain are among the lowest (40 BD).  At 
these salaries, full room and board are normally provided. 
Complaints include partial or non-payment of salaries, 
extreme hours, lack of freedom to leave the house, verbal or 
physical abuse, and in some cases, rape. 
 
The Philippine Embassy has the most active worker protection 
program in the Kingdom.  The Embassy provides help for 
workers to find new employment, assistance to resolve 
disputes, and a shelter for abused housemaids.   Most 
complaints involve delayed or partial payment of salary or 
verbal harrassment.  Workers from the Philippines who go 
through reputable recruiting agents use contracts approved by 
both the Philippine Ministry of Labor Overseas Labor Office 
(POLO) and the Foreign Ministry, which works with its embassy 
in Bahrain to determine fair wages and working conditions. 
POLO also provides health care and registers workers to vote 
in the Philippine National elections.  Workers who go through 
these legal channels and have embassy representation 
generally face fewer problems.  The demand for Filipina 
housemaids is such, however, that the Philippines Embassy 
estimates that 4000 to 5000 may be in Bahrain without going 
through these channels, which makes them more vulnerable to 
abuse. 
 
Although Bahraini labor law does not cover domestic workers, 
they can approach the Ministry of Labor\'s Complaint 
Department for help in resolving most disputes, and they can 
seek legal redress from forced labor under the penal code. 
Some local embassies report that government officials are 
fair in resolving disputes, but many workers do not know 
about the complaint department service, and implementation of 
its decisions can be difficult.  Due to a general lack of 
awareness of workers\' rights, employers can easily make 
inordinate demands of their employees.  The Bangladeshi 
Embassy told us it receives few complaints from workers (only 
one or two every two or three months) because:  a) the men 
fear that their sponsors will file false reports about them 
of theft or negligence of duty, and b) the women do not know 
their rights and it is not in their nature to complain. 
 
Numerous sources report that the sex industry in Bahrain is 
almost wholly voluntary.  When prodded on the question of 
forced or coerced prostitution, most embassies denied that 
any of their nationals were involved.  Last year, one embassy 
said that at least 8 out of 10 of the women from his country 
who come to Bahrain to work as prostitutes did so with full 
knowledge of what was expected of them.  (NOTE:  This 
estimate appeared to be more of a hunch than a research-based 
analysis.)  Women who come to perform in bands and dance 
groups (often from Belarus, Moldova, and the Ukraine) usually 
do just that, and do so in costumes that are far less 
revealing than one finds in an average music video.  Some may 
choose to offer sexual services, but only at their own 
discretion.  Physical contact between performers and audience 
members is strictly forbidden.  Violations of these rules led 
to the closure of 17 entertainment outlets this reporting 
period. 
 
Last year,s TIP report mentioned that Russian women have a 
more difficult time obtaining visas to come to Bahrain.  For 
example, an Embassy officer observed that approximately 170 
Russian and Slavic women entered on ,visit visas, to 
Bahrain on November 26, 2003.  These women were accompanied 
by 7-10 transaction agents.  The agents have agreements with 
Arab agents and some hotels to house the women.  Some have 
reported that they are locked in their rooms for night work 
but are free to go to the shopping malls and walk the 
corniche (boardwalk) during the day.  Two sources on a Hong 
Kong to Bahrain flight noted that in February 2004, 
approximately 60 Chinese women arrived in Bahrain to  work, 
through the Formula One event. 
 
F.  N/A--Bahrain is a destination country. 
 
G.  There is political will at the highest levels to combat 
trafficking.  However, it is difficult to measure the amount 
of resources the GOB is devoting to combating TIP.  In 
December 2003 the National Assembly approved the UN 
Convention on Transnational Crime and the optional protocols 
on the rights of the child and trafficking.  On March 10, the 
MFA officially notified the Embassy of Bahrain,s accession 
to this Convention.  The GOB established an inter-ministerial 
task force to design a national plan to combat TIP.  The 
committee is chaired by Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Mubarak 
Al-Khalifa, an Assistant Undersecretary in the Foreign 
Ministry and brother of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa.  According 
to Shaikh Abdul Aziz, the Bahraini Embassy in Washington has 
also assigned a diplomat to liaise with the State Department 
and Congress on TIP matters; we will update the Department 
when we learn this person\'s name. 
 
We do not believe that high-level GOB officials are involved 
in TIP and we have no information alleging that that they 
are.  However, the practice of \"sponsoring\" workers--and 
receiving a substantial fee (up to USD 1200) from the 
sponsored worker without providing them a job--occurs 
frequently here.  This practice is illegal, but some 
Bahrainis from influential families may be involved in this 
practice of providing \"free visas.\" 
 
A hotline was established in February 2003 for people to 
provide information on \"free visa\" workers (there may be 
40,000 to 50,000 of them in Bahrain), but it has not yet been 
used as a tool to identify sponsors. 
 
H.  We have no reason to believe that GOB authorities condone 
or facilitate trafficking.  Customs officials act 
professionally and we have no reports of their accepting 
bribes.  Post has uncovered no information about bribes paid 
to government officials to facilitate the trafficking of 
individuals to Bahrain. 
 
I.    The police in Bahrain are adequately funded. 
Corruption in government is not an overall problem.  Bahrain 
is not a low per-capita income country.  One limiting factor 
has been a lack of Labor Ministry inspectors.  Last year the 
number of inspectors was increased from 9 to 40.  The 
Minister of Labor told the Ambassador that the ministry plans 
to add 30 more inspectors.  There are more than 20 inspectors 
for entertainment outlets (the responsibility for this falls 
under the Information Ministry\'s Tourism Affairs Office and 
includes hotels, restaurants, and clubs), and at least one 
inspector visits each of the 91 licensed entertainment 
outlets daily.  MOLSA is seeking the authority for its 
nspectors to have arrest power.  Labor inspections occur 1) 
randomly, 2) upon application for a work permit; (3) after an 
employee complaint; (4) by request of an employer and (5) to 
follow up on a previous site visit. 
 
J.    The GOB does not systematically monitor its 
anti-trafficking efforts or make available its assessments of 
these efforts.  The inter-ministerial committee meets 
periodically to discuss various government anti-TIP efforts. 
 
K.  Prostitution is illegal and the activities of brothels 
and pimps are criminalized.  Enforcement, however, is 
variable. 
 
--------------- 
19. Prevention 
--------------- 
 
A.  Yes.  Bahraini government officials have acknowledged 
that trafficking in persons is an international problem that 
all countries must address and that must be better understood 
locally. 
B.  The inter-ministerial task force consists of 
representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Labor 
and Social Affairs, Information, Justice, Interior, and 
Cabinet Affairs. 
 
C.  A media campaign previously slated for March 2003 was 
launched December 9, 2003.  The English-speaking press 
continues to highlight the conditions faced by some 
expatriate workers and featured 20 cases of housemaid abuse. 
The Government censors some news that embarrasses the 
country.  Its allowing publication of worker abuse stories 
indicates that the GOB is serious about stopping trafficking. 
 This does not appear to be a concerted media effort. 
 
The GOB has published a manual on the rights and duties of 
expatriate workers in Bahrain that has not yet been given to 
local embassies, Bahraini embassies abroad, and manpower 
recruitment agencies that do business in Bahrain.  In 
addition, the GOB has published a simpler brochure that is 
intended for distribution directly to expatriate workers.  It 
is translated into six languages; Urdu, Thai, Singhalese, 
Arabic, English, and Tagalog.  In 2004, there are plans to 
translate the brochure into Bengali. 
 
D.  The Bahraini Government promotes women\'s participation in 
economic and political decision-making and continues to make 
good strides.  Women voted for the first time in a referendum 
in February 2001.  Bahrain\'s new constitution guarantees 
women full political rights. Young girls and women make up 70 
percent and higher of enrollment in educational institutions. 
 
E.  The GOB has expressed its willingness to work with the 
IOM in conjunction with a Department-funded project (pending 
official funding notification).  At present, it lacks the 
expertise to support an effective prevention campaign. 
 
F.  The MFA has met with the Bahrain Centre for Human 
Rights, Migrant Workers Group three times in the past 7 
months.  In January 2004, Salma Bala of the Migrant Workers 
Group submitted a list of 200 labor cases that are stuck in 
the courts.  In February 2004, Shaikh Abdul Aziz reviewed 
them on behalf of the inter-ministerial committee and met 
with the Chief Prosecutor to push 50 of the critical cases to 
resolution and to halt forced repatriation.  Post continues 
to encourage a more institutionalized arrangement and has 
contacted several embassies to probe their interest. 
 
G.  The GOB monitors its borders and immigration effectively. 
 Border officials are competent at recognizing forged 
documents, but are not specifically trained to recognize TIP. 
 Post has no information that any immigration official 
attempts to track information related to TIP. 
 
H.  The GOB established an inter-ministerial national 
taskforce in February 2002 that met periodically this year. 
It is the focal point for the GOB\'s anti-TIP policies.  The 
GOB does not have a public corruption task force, but, the 
elected Council of Representatives does have an Investigative 
Committee.  That Committee, for example, has highlighted 
serious financial mismanagement of the Government,s pension 
funds, and may pursue removal of the ministers responsible 
for the funds, mismanagement. 
 
I.  At present, the GOB does not coordinate its anti-TIP 
efforts with multinational or international working groups. 
However, the GOB has agreed to work with the IOM if the 
Department decides to fund IOM,s project proposal. 
 
J.    The GOB has a national plan of action.  The Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs, Labor, Information, Justice, and Interior 
were involved in drafting this plan.  NGOs were not consulted 
during the drafting of this plan.  Parts of the action plan 
were not made public.  On December 9, Shaikh Abdul Aziz held 
a press conference to underscore that the GOB is working to 
prevent abuse of migrant workers.  He announced that the GOB 
will focus on educating families with a media campaign 
launched by each directorate, that MOLSA will take a more 
active role with overseeing inspections and investigations, 
and target date for the first GOB victim assistance shelter 
is March 30.  Reported in the press on February 24, the 
Chairman of Municipality Affairs Committee has agreed to have 
the Sitra market organization (Corners Committee) help empty 
the souq of &free visa8 workers. 
 
K.  Yes, the inter-ministerial task force. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
20.  Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
A.  The Bahraini penal code does not specifically criminalize 
trafficking in persons.  However, it does explicitly outlaw 
forced labor (including unjustifiable withholding of salary) 
for the government (Article 198) or for any other kind of 
work (Article 302 amended).  Forced prostitution through 
coercion, threat or deceit (Article 325) is also outlawed. 
While these articles provide significant protection for 
victims of trafficking, it remains a lengthy process to 
achieve redress of grievances in the current court system. 
The Head of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Labor warned us 
that the available English translation of the Penal Code is 
not as clear as the original Arabic. 
 
Article 198:  \"A punishment of imprisonment for a period not 
exceeding 10 years shall be inflicted upon every civil 
servant or officer entrusted with a public service who 
employs, by forced labor, workers to work for the Government 
or one of the authorities mentioned in Article 107 hereof 
(defines civil servant) or unjustifiably withhold all or some 
of their wages.\" 
 
Article 302 amended by Legislative Decree No. 6 of 1993: 
\"Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 198, a 
punishment of imprisonment and a fine, or either penalty, 
shall be inflicted upon every person who employs forced labor 
to undertake any work or unjustifiably withholds all or some 
of their wages.\" 
 
Law on Immorality and Prostitution (Chapter 3, Bahraini Penal 
Code 1976): 
 
Article 325:  \"1.  Every person who forces a male or female 
to commit acts of immorality or prostitution by way of 
coercion, threat or deceit shall be liable for imprisonment 
for a period of no less than 2 years and no more than 7 
years.  2.  If the victim is less than 18 years of age, the 
punishment shall be a prison sentence for a period not less 
than 3 years and no more than 10 years.\" 
 
B.  See 18A 
 
C.  Law on Rape and Sexual Assault (Chapter 2, Bahraini Penal 
Code 1976): 
 
Article 344:  \"Any person who assaults a female shall be 
liable for a prison sentence for a period not exceeding 10 
years.  A prison sentence shall be the penalty if the victim 
is less than 16 years of age.\" 
 
Article 346:  \"A prison sentence for a period not exceeding 7 
years shall be the punishment for any person who assaults a 
person against his will.  The punishment shall be a prison 
sentence if the victim is less than 7 years of age.  The 
penalty shall be imprisonment for a term of no more than 10 
years if the victim is more than 7 years of age but has not 
reached the age of sixteen.\" 
 
Article 348:  \"The following shall be aggravating 
circumstances in the crimes provided for in the preceding 
articles of this chapter:  1.  If the perpetrator is one of 
the victim\'s close relatives or those responsible for 
bringing him/her up, guardianship or having authority over 
him, or one of his servants or working with one of the 
aforesaid persons.  2.  If the perpetrator is one of the 
public servants or officers entrusted with a public service, 
clergymen, medical practitioners or their assistants and has 
abused his office, position or trust in him.  3.  If the 
crime is jointly committed by two persons or more who 
cooperated in overpowering the victim or took turns in 
committing the same act against the victim.  4.  If the 
victim sustains a venereal disease as a result of committing 
the crime.  5.  If the victim becomes pregnant or suffers 
loss of virginity by reason of the crime.\" 
 
D.    Post has received contradictory information on this 
subject.  Because \"trafficking\" is not a legal concept under 
Bahraini law, no one has been prosecuted or convicted 
specifically for trafficking.  The subject of prostitution is 
a very sensitive issue in this conservative society and most 
of our Bahraini interlocutors are not keen to discuss it. 
The other legal cases we are aware of are civil cases in 
Labor court and involve disputes over non-payment of salary. 
In 2003 MOLSA reported that there were 84 domestic worker 
complaints, 46 of which were settled and 38 of which went to 
court.  Most cases involved nonpayment of salary.  MOLSA can 
remove a domestic worker from the place of employment and 
repatriate the employee at the employer,s expense.  There is 
one alleged case of forced repatriation by the GOB.  Attorney 
Fatima Hawaj reported to the press on February 13 that the 
General Directorate of Immigration, Passports and Residency 
repatriated her client, a Bangladeshi worker involved in a 
labor dispute case, against her client,s will and without 
her knowledge.  The labor courts had no option but to drop 
the case.  In February, Shaikh Abdul Aziz halted forced 
repatriation of 50 Indian workers who were in the middle of 
having their free visa cases decided by the Labor courts. 
These cases were brought to his attention by BCHR,s Migrant 
Worker,s Group. 
 
E.  Those implicated in trafficking to Bahrain are manpower 
recruitment agencies, local and in source countries, as well 
as individual Bahraini sponsors who change labor contracts 
upon a worker\'s arrival.  The GOB has established a database 
of complaints and actions taken regarding individual cases. 
This year, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs tracked 
140 recruitment agencies and sixty three (63) have been shut 
down for malpractice.  In December 2003, the Ministry of 
Information Tourism Inspectorate shut down 10 tourism 
agencies for violating laws which promote clean tourism. 
 
F.  The GOB investigates abuses when it learns of them, but 
the Government does not systematically investigate cases of 
trafficking and probably lacks the expertise to do so 
effectively.  Bahraini law allows for covert police 
operations, but these techniques are not used to investigate 
trafficking. 
 
G.  The GOB does not provide any specialized training for 
government officials to recognize, investigate, and prosecute 
trafficking, and it currently lacks the expertise to do so. 
However, we are awaiting formal funding notification from the 
Department on an IOM project that will begin training GOB 
officials to pursue trafficking cases. 
 
H.    Post does not know of any cooperative international 
investigations on trafficking involving Bahrain.  However, 
local embassies report that the GOB government generally 
cooperates in investigating reported abuses of workers when 
the embassies raise specific complaints with GOB officials. 
In January 2004, the Philippine mission brought to the 
attention of the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs 37 
worker abuse cases that have languished in the labor courts 
for at least two years.  Several cases are ongoing even 
though the complainants have attended over 10 hearings on 
their cases.  One case dates back six years concerning a 
housemaid claiming unpaid salary.  She abandoned her legal 
case and returned to the Philippines in December 2003. 
 
I.  Post has no knowledge of any extradition requests 
involving trafficking in Bahrain.   The Kingdom of Bahrain is 
a party to a number of bilateral extradition treaties and 
some multinational arrangements, including the Agreement to 
Combat Trans-Arab Organized Crime and the Arab Agreement to 
Combat Terrorism.  The US and Bahrain do not have a bilateral 
extradition treaty. 
 
J.  As mentioned in section 23H, government officials 
do not directly condone or facilitate trafficking. However, 
the government does tolerate the sale of \"free visas\" by 
certain prominent individuals.  These individuals import 
numerous laborers without verifiable employment.  Upon 
arrival, these workers (who often mortgage their belongings 
to pay up to USD 1200 or more for sponsorship and travel fees 
to get to Bahrain) are told to find work elsewhere. In many 
cases, the sponsors require monthly or annual fees for 
workers to maintain their right to remain in-country.  There 
may be approximately 40-50,000 of these \"free visa workers\" 
in Bahrain.  As they are not working for their original 
sponsor, their status is illegal and their rights precarious. 
 Many such workers must take whatever work they can find.  On 
December 3, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs 
announced to the press that MOLSA will be clamping down on 
free visas and runaway workers.  There are no 2003 statistics 
available of arrests or prosecution of free visas sponsors. 
Reported in the press on February 24, the Chairman of the 
Municipality Affairs Committee has agreed to have the Sitra 
market organization (Corners Committee) help empty the souq 
of &free visa8 workers. 
 
K.  No GOB officials have been prosecuted for involvement in 
offenses related to trafficking.  Sponsorship rules were 
reformed in the summer of 2002 to allow workers to change 
sponsors/jobs without a \"no objection\" letter from their 
current sponsor.  Theoretically, this allows workers to 
remove themselves legally from potentially abusive 
situations.  However, there are some conditions attached 
(e.g., the new employer must reimburse the original sponsor 
for any expenses involving the worker\'s entry into Bahrain), 
and it is not clear that many unskilled workers with little 
education are aware of this rule change to take advantage of 
it. 
 
The GOB established a telephone hotline to collect 
information on \"free visa\" workers, all of whom are, by 
definition, working in Bahrain illegally.  It is not yet 
clear if this information will be used to target sponsors for 
prosecution, or workers for deportation.   The GOB 
established a telephone hotline (17870176) for anyone to 
reoprt worker abuse.  The GOB announced that it would staff 
this hotline 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  The 
Embassy tested this hotline on 21 occasions.  The phone was 
answered twice.  Those who answered the phone did not appear 
to be knowledgeable about or trained in victim abuse 
referral.  Post notes that MOLSA initially published an 
incorrect phone number for the hotline in the newspaper.  The 
error has been corrected.  On December 7, 2003, the GOB 
announced plans to upgrade the current hotline to record all 
calls.  BCHR reported that MOLSA has assigned a new employee, 
Nabila Rajab (sister of BCHR,s President) to run the 
hotline.  She reported that her staff is in dire need of 
training.  There are no statistics available on the number of 
calls or referrals. 
 
L.  ILO Convention 182:  signed and ratified, Feb. 2001 
 
ILO Convention 29 and 105:  signed and ratified. 
 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child:  signed and ratified. 
In December 2003, the Parliament approved the UN Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime and two protocols to 
prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children and smuggling of migrants by 
land, sea and air.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz notified the Embassy of 
Bahrain,s accession to this Convention. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
21.  Protection and Assistance to Victims 
------------------------------------------ 
 
A.  The government does not regularly provide assistance to 
trafficking victims such as shelter and medical or 
psychological services, but may provide temporary shelter 
and/or medical services in extreme cases.  Generally, such 
services are up to the victim\'s local embassy or NGOs.  One 
embassy has a facility for women, and local NGOs help some 
people on an ad hoc basis.  Should these options not be 
available, the police are allowed to temporarily house 
victims at police stations while a case is being 
investigated.  Police are not supposed to return victims to 
their sponsors if they believe the victims will be harmed; 
Post does not know if this prescription is generally 
followed.  There is no established system for providing legal 
or psychological services, but emergency medical treatment is 
available to anyone in Bahrain.  There are no established 
victim care facilities.  The GOB issued a public statement in 
December that a victim assistance shelter would be completed 
by March 31.  At the time of this report, no shelter had been 
erected.  On December 10, BCHR advertised in the press its 
plans to establish a victim assistance shelter and opened a 
bank account to receive donations.  On March 5, BCHR held a 5 
kilometer charity run to raise money for its shelter. 
 
The government does provide mediation services at the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.  The Ministry\'s 
complaint department has a staff of 10 people with the sole 
duty to achieve amicable settlements of disputes between 
sponsors and employees.  The government often allows 
temporary residency during disputes (relief from deportation) 
and tolerates work for non-sponsors while a worker seeks 
settlement or legal redress. 
 
B.  The GOB does not provide funding or other support to 
foreign or domestic NGOs for services to victims.  However, 
Post introduced two local human rights NGOs to the MFA and we 
have heard through multiple channels that they continue to 
meet and are looking for areas of potential cooperation on 
matters involving expatriate workers in Bahrain. 
 
C.  Cases where workers have been detained, jailed, or fined 
for criminal offenses are relatively few.  In 2003, the press 
cited one case of an abused Ethiopian housemaid that murdered 
her employer.  She was found guilty and her death sentence 
was commuted to life in prison.  According to the Ministry of 
Labor\'s Legal Advisor, prison sentences are meted out only 
where criminality accompanies a labor dispute, such as murder 
or theft.  Workers not working for their sponsor are subject 
to deportation.  Free visa violators are held at the 
Immigration Residence while being processed for deportation. 
D.  In cases where mediation by the Ministry of Labor\'s 
complaint department does not succeed in resolving disputes, 
government officials encourage workers to pursue legal 
action.  The Ministry\'s Legal Advisor tells us that the 
ministry\'s mediators facilitate contact with lawyers.  The 
government often tolerates work for non-sponsors during legal 
disputes and allows/facilitates change of sponsors under 
situations of duress.  In 2002, the government introduced new 
rules that increase the flexibility of a rigid sponsorship 
law that in the past made the task of changing one\'s 
job/sponsor very difficult.  However, the requirements for 
utilizing these new rules and changing one\'s job legally are 
not well understood, especially by poorly educated laborers 
and domestic workers.  Sponsors are required to pay for 
repatriation of workers, regardless of whether or not the 
full contract has been fulfilled.  In cases where they 
refuse, the cost often falls to local embassies. 
 
E.  Protection of victims normally falls to their local 
embassy, but GOB officials have told us that a victim in 
imminent physical danger would be protected and sheltered by 
the police.  Due to the lack of known examples, it is not 
possible to determine the GOB\'s actual practice. 
 
F.  The GOB does not provide any specialized training for 
government officials in recognizing trafficking and assisting 
the needs of victims.  However, the IOM project-- --will 
assist the GOB in providing this sort of training.  The 
manual and pamphlet explaining workers\' rights and 
obligations will also help educate Bahrainis on matters 
relating to trafficking. 
 
G.  N/A.  Post has no information that suggests that Bahraini 
nationals are victims of trafficking. 
 
H. Local embassies are the biggest source of assistance to 
trafficking victims.  The Philippine Embassy has the most 
developed assistance program, including an on-site shelter 
for workers who run away from their sponsors/employers.  The 
Philippine Overseas Workers Welfare Administration provides 
legal assistance, loans, health insurance, voting 
registration assistance, counseling, repatriation and 
reintegration services.  Other embassies also provide 
services, but on a more ad hoc basis.  In severe cases of 
abuse or destitution, they seek placement of victims within 
their local national community until repatriation can be 
arranged. On February 17, the Indian Embassy announced that 
it will start registering Indian guest workers in an effort 
to help workers in distress and to reach out to Indian free 
visa workers. 
 
I.  The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Migrant Worker\'s 
Group seeks to address the issue of trafficking and working 
conditions for expatriates.  Several staff members have told 
Post of their experiences in sheltering victims on an ad hoc 
basis.  Post introduced several members to the GOB\'s 
anti-trafficking task force, and they have met three times 
since then to look for ways to cooperate.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz 
has continued to meet with individual ministries and NGOs. 
The IOM project will seek to increase the capacity of local 
NGOs to assist victims.  The Bahrain Human Rights Society has 
members who are interested in the issue, but Post has no 
information on any related activities that this organization 
engages in.  The Indian Charitable Relief Committee (ICRC) 
visits a different \"work camp\" every month, providing medical 
check-ups and food to laborers working there. Helping Hands 
Charity provides temporary food and shelter to abused 
workers.

1.(C) SUMMARY 
 
Bahrain\'s senior International Organizations official stated 
that his country would support the U.S. candidacy for the 
Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights Commission.  He indicated basic agreement with U.S. 
positions on reglious intolerance and democracy and was open 
to U.S. ideas on possible resolutions on development and the 
death penalty.  With the caveat that Bahrain will, under no 
circumstances, vote against Arab Group consensus, Bahrain may 
be able to vote with the U.S. on the DPRK, Belarus, Russia 
(Chechnya), and Afghanistan.  Bahrain supports our Iraq 
position.  We expect Bahrain to vote against the U.S. 
position on Cuba, China, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Zimbabwe. 
Bahrain would like to see greater U.S. - Arab Group 
cooperation on resolution texts to avoid confrontation with 
the U.S. on Middle East human rights resolutions.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
BAHRAIN SUPPORTS US SUB-COMMISSION CANDIDACY, OPPOSES CUBA 
RESOLUTION 
 
2.(C) P/E Chief reviewed reftel issues on March 10 with MFA 
Director for International Organization Affairs Ghassan 
Shaikho (strictly protect).  Before calling in his 
notetakers,  Shaikho said he had discussed Bahrain\'s U.N. 
voting record last year with his superiors, highlighting the 
fact that Iran voted with the U.S. more than Bahrain. 
However, his bosses had reacted with indifference to his 
message that Bahrain should at least do better than Iran.  He 
predicted that Bahrain would again vote against a Cuba 
resolution as compensation for Cuban support of Bahrain in 
the Commission during the 90\'s.  On a positive note, Shaikho 
confided that he had instructed his Mission in Geneva to vote 
in favor of David Rivkin\'s candidacy for the Sub-Commission 
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
STYLE MATTERS IN VOTE CANVASSING 
 
3.(C) Shaikho also cautioned the U.S. on its diplomatic style 
in the Commission, saying that a Gulf country had recently 
complained to Bahrain that the U.S. delegation had \"bullied\" 
its delegation in Geneva.  Shaikho stated that the U.S. 
delegation has a reputation for making \"overly strong private 
pitches\" and presenting resolutions with \"excessively 
confrontational\" preambular language and \"harsh\" operative 
paragraphs.  Shaikho suggested that a gentler, softer touch 
might win us more votes. 
 
RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE, DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, DEATH PENALTY, 
AND CORPORATE NORMS 
 
4.(C) With notetakers present, Shaikho said that Bahrain 
could support the expected Dutch resolution on religious 
intolerance if it included last year\'s language on 
anti-Semitism and Islamaphobia.  After all, he quipped, Arabs 
are Semites.  Noting that he had not yet seen a draft, 
Shaikho said Bahrain would probably support Rumania\'s 
democracy resolution and he expressed hope that Bahrain, as a 
regional leader in political reform and a participant in the 
Community of Democracies, would be included in the 
Commission\'s democracy caucus.  Shaikho noted our position 
that any development resolution be consistent with statements 
agreed at the International Conference on Financing for 
Development in Monterrey and the WTO Ministerial in Doha. 
Bahrain opposes the death penalty, Shaikho said, but 
understood our approach and might be able to work with us to 
explore options other than an omnibus resolution.  He noted 
our position on the Sub-Commission\'s Norms on the human 
rights responsibilities of businesses, but made no 
substantive comment other than to advise his notetakers to 
\"watch out for the G-77 position on the issue.\" 
 
COUNTRY RESOLUTIONS 
 
5.(C) Shaikho stated forthrightly that Bahrain does not like 
country resolutions and suggested that offering technical 
assistance packages would be a more useful tool for 
convincing countries to improve their human rights records. 
Shaikho made no promises on a China resolution, but listened 
attentively to our list of China\'s 2003 backsliding on human 
rights.  (COMMENT:  We seriously doubt that Bahrain would 
vote against China.  END COMMENT)  He made clear that Bahrain 
could not support us on Iran, but intimated that we could 
probably expect Bahraini support on the DPRK.  He reiterated 
Bahrain\'s support for our position on Iraq.  After asking his 
staff to research the Afghanistan Independent Expert concept 
in detail, Shaikho suggested we could expect Bahrain\'s 
support here is as well.  On the other hand, Shaikho advised 
that Bahrain\'s support for the Turkmenistan resolution would 
be unlikely if Turmenistan lobbied the Islamic caucus. 
Support for a resolution on Belarus seemed possible, Shaikho 
indicated, and was very likely on a Russia (Chechnya) 
resolution after the recent assassination in Qatar.  Shaikho 
concluded that a Bahrain vote for a Zimbabwe resolution would 
be impossible unless African consensus broke.  He said 
African support for Arab Group positions is too important for 
an Arab state to vote against Africa Group consensus. 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
 
6.(C) Shaikho implored the U.S. not to support a move to try 
to cut by 50 percent the time allotted to Arab Group issues. 
He said Bahrain did not want confrontation at the Commission. 
 Shaikho recommended that the U.S. try to work with the Arabs 
to narrow differences on texts.  This, he thought, would be a 
win/win solution.  He mentioned favorably the Bahraini 
PerRep\'s recent meeting with the USDEL leader and suggested 
that Bahrain could help facilitate better understanding 
between the U.S. and the Arab Group. 
 
COMMENT 
 
7.(C) Bahrain entered the Human Rights Commission with the 
goal of vindicating its human rights record, rather than with 
the objective of improving human rights around the world. 
Bahrain\'s view appears to have altered during its term on the 
Commission; hence our optimism that we may see more support 
than previously.  However, Bahrain will not break Arab Group 
consensus, nor will it vote against those countries that 
supported Bahrain during the 90\'s.  END COMMENT.

Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford, reason 1.5 (d) 
 
1.  (C)  The Bahraini Government is still pondering what to 
do about bringing our signed Article 98 agreement into 
effect.  Charge on March 16 again asked the MFA Minister of 
State whether the Government would agree to a confidential 
exchange of notes.  The Minister, clearly annoyed that Charge 
was again raising the subject, said some legal experts inside 
the Government believe the Article 98 agreement must go to 
the Parliament to be ratified.  Others in Government 
disagree, and the argument is ongoing.  Charge pointed out 
that the American law originally envisioned that the U.S. 
Government would suspend some kinds of military assistance to 
those countries which failed to finalize Article 98 
agreements; we could not exclude that this might happen to 
Bahrain as time goes by.  We had warned the GoB about this 
when we began the process two years ago, Charge recalled.  He 
urged the GoB to decide upon a course of action and move 
ahead. 
 
2.  (C)  The Minister said he had received a report from the 
meeting in Washington between NEA PDAS Larocco and the 
Bahraini Ambassador.  The GoB has the message, he stated 
flatly.  He then asked Washington to understand the GoB\'s 
situation.  Anti-American sentiment in the Parliament now is 
very strong and the elected lower house will not approve the 
Article 98.  At the same time, the MFA does not want to go 
around the Parliament if the law requires that the agreement 
go to the deputies for ratification; the experience from the 
parliamentary investigations of financial sector misdeeds 
shows the harm which can come to a Ministry responsible for 
legally dubious policies.  The Government is trying to find a 
middle ground solution that enables it to bring the agreement 
into force and yet scrupulously follows the law and 
parliamentary preogatives.  In the meantime, the Minister 
stressed, the GoB will not turn over a U.S. servicemember to 
the ICC. 
 
3.  (C) Separately, POL/ECON chief learned on March 16 from 
the deputy director of the legal advisor\'s office at the 
Ministry of Cabinet Affairs (attached to the Prime Minister\'s 
Office) that Cabinet Affairs had decided the Article 98 would 
have to go to the Parliament because it relates to the rights 
of individuals.  It has told the MFA the only way to move 
forward is through the Parliament. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  The Minister is not exaggerating about 
Parliament.  As we have reported in recent months (see refs b 
and c for example), the Parliament is more assertive and it 
has caused powerful ministries such as Finance major 
headaches when it disagreed with Ministry policies (refs b 
and c).  Our read of the ascendent Islamist bloc in the 
Parliament is that they would never agree to the Article 98, 
perceiving it as a special favor to the American military for 
which they have no affection. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment Continued:  The MFA is searching anxiously 
for a way out of sending the Article 98 to Parliament.  We 
are doubtful that the MFA will find it quickly if at all.  In 
the meantime, they are holding the signed agreement.  We are 
confident that the GoB would not turn over a servicemember to 
the ICC.  The bilateral military relationship, centered 
around the longstanding, and basically trouble-free, presence 
of NAVCENT\'s headquarters, is the cornerstone of our 
bilateral relationship.  The GoB went out of its way to 
provide access to facilities for OEF and OIF; it deployed air 
and naval forces in support of U.S. forces in those 
operations.  IMET and FMF assistance are key to boosting 
Bahraini forces\' interoperability with our own in such 
operations.  Cancelling that assistance because the 
Government is reluctant to face a losing confrontation with 
its democratically elected parliament over an issue which has 
never before been a problem in our bilateral relationship 
would send a message to the Bahraini leadership that we 
neither value their contributions nor trust their word.  Ford

SUBJECT: SUPPORT FOR GREATER MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE IN 
BAHRAIN.AT LEAST FROM SOME. 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Following U/S Grossman\'s visit to Bahrain on 
3/3/04, Charg was invited by Al-Wasat Newspaper, to 
participate in a discussion forum about the Greater 
Middle East Initiative on 3/14/04.  The forum was 
attended by a cross section of Bahrainis representing 
academia, business, media, and government. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The majority of discussants were supportive 
of the initiative praising its raising Arab public 
concerns about problems such as tyranny, transparency, 
education, and the role of women.  An academic 
remarked, \"This is our agenda.  The Americans only 
wrote down what we have been talking about.\"  The 
initiative also encourages long awaited reform.  A 
Bahraini parliamentarian was adamant that the reform 
that Arabs have hoped for decades has not come from 
within.  Instead, much of the Arab world finds itself 
in a predicament far worse than decades ago. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The group believed that the initiative will 
continue to face opposition simply because it is a U.S. 
initiative.  They cited the Palestinian/Israeli issue 
and the war on Iraq as reducing American credibility. 
Some suggested that the Arab world should accept the 
initiative and begin to implement it without the 
cooperation of the U.S., thus increasing its 
credibility.  The Charg reminded participants that the 
USG remains committed to the Road Map and the 
establishment of a Palestinian state.  He questioned 
the wisdom of Arab peoples missing out on a real 
opportunity for internal progress, via the initiative, 
by solely focusing on the Palestinian/Israeli question. 
He encouraged participants to focus on the development 
of the Arab world. 
 
4.  (SBU)  An Islamist teacher and politician 
participating in the round table pushed back hard 
against the initiative, citing particularly the \"My 
Arabic Library\" program.  He suggested that the books 
would propagate Christian values and brainwash Bahraini 
children.  The Charg asserted that the book program 
and other initiatives would not impose any values but 
encourage children to read and think.  The Islamist 
shot back a stern refusal \"During the Cold War would 
you have accepted children\'s books from Russia in your 
public school classrooms?\" 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment:  The discussion forum at Al-Wasat 
elicited more positive commentary than expected by 
EmbOffs.  Clearly there are educated Bahrainis who 
welcome the initiative.  Some of the participants 
provided insight into the views of liberal Bahrainis 
who may not be ideological allies of the U.S., but see 
the initiative as serving the interests of both the 
U.S. and the Arab world.  Though not totally 
representative of Bahraini society, they are opinion 
shapers.  Conservative Bahrainis question the motives 
of the initiative and are not convinced that it serves 
the interests of the Arab world.  Increasingly 
influential Bahraini Islamists, who believe implicitly 
that the U.S. is out to undermine Islam and Arab 
society, question the motives of the initiative and are 
deeply skeptical that it serves the interests of the 
Arab world.

SUBJECT: LABOR MINISTRY ISSUES FINANCIAL REGULATIONS FOR 
CHARITIES 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reason 1.4(d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  In early March, Bahrain\'s Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs issued more stringent regulations for 
charities\' financial activities.  The rules require charities 
to maintain accounts and share them with ministry inspectors 
on a quarterly basis.  Charities\' accounts must be audited 
annually if revenues and expenditures exceed USD 26,500.  The 
new rules also require charities to obtain a permit from the 
Labor Ministry to solicit donations and to transfer money 
outside Bahrain.  Charities must use a monetary institution 
to conduct financial transactions greater than USD 2650. 
Although lacking criminal penalties, the new regulations 
appear likely to deter terrorists\' use of local charities to 
move money.  Notably, the GOB found a way to issue these 
rules without submitting them to the Islamist-dominated House 
of Representatives for approval.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(U)  On March 6 al-Wasat newspaper published a Labor 
Ministry order establishing new financial reporting rules for 
charity organizations.  All charity organizations in Bahrain 
must register with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. 
According to a knowledgeable MOLSA source, religious 
charities like religious charities like Jamiyat al-Islaah, 
Jamiyat al-Tarbiya al-Islamiya, and Jamiyat al-Tawiya 
al-Islamiya are also registered with MOLSA and covered by 
this order.  The Embassy\'s unofficial translation of the text 
of the ministerial order follows:

4. (C) COMMENT:  Almost two years to the day from the Finance 
Minister\'s announcement of this initiative to former Treasury 
Secretary O\'Neal, the Labor Ministry finally promulgated 
 
SIPDIS 
financial regulations that should constrain the ability of 
terrorists to move money through Bahrain.  Notably, the GOB 
found a way to issue the regulations without submitting them 
to the Islamist-dominated House of Representatives. 
Interestingly, an earlier draft of the regulations, which we 
obtained from a MOLSA source contained administrative 
penalties, including revocation of license, for breaking the 
regulations.  The lack of a penalty clause clearly weakens 
the regulations.  Post will seek GOB expanation for its 
deletion.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SIX SHARIA COURT JUDGES GET SACKED 
 
REF: A. 04 MANAMA 268 
 
     B. 03 MANAMA 1438 
 
Classified By: By Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  In a move that could boost the rule of law 
and protect women\'s rights, the Justice Minister summarily 
sacked six Shari\'a court judges.  This is unprecedented. 
Although the press reported the firings, no reasons for the 
dismissals were provided.  The Justice Minister asked our 
MEPI-funded American Bar Association (ABA) legal advisor 
(strictly protect) to review the files of the dismissed 
judges.  The Advisor said all six contained evidence of 
accepting bribes and coercing sex from female litigants. 
Women\'s societies and activists laud the GOB\'s action, but 
also call for more reform. Having been repeatedly told by the 
Minister of Justice that Shari\'a courts are off limits when 
it comes to reform (because Shari\'a courts are under the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs) the 
dismissal of these judges tells us that judicial reform could 
be swift, unexpected, pervasive and not necessarily low 
profile (see reftel A). Our legal advisor recommended 
criminal prosecution of the sacked judges.  Their 
prosecution, conviction, and incarceration would be a 
powerful symbol that the King is committed to the rule of law 
in Bahrain.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  On March 11, the local press reported on the 
dismissal of five Shari\'a court judges: two from the Sunni 
Shari\'a High Court (Shaikh Jassim Mutlaq Al Thawadi and 
Shaikh Abdulla Al Malki) and three from the Shi\'a Jaafari 
Court (Mohammed Jaafer Al Jufairi, Shaikh Saeed Al Oraibi and 
Shaikh Mohsin Al Asfoor).  No reason was given for their 
dismissal.  On March 14, local Arab press reported the 
suspension of an additional Sunni High Court Judge Shaikh 
Jala Al Shargi. 
 
3.  (U)  Shaikh Jassim Mutlaq Al Thawadi responded publicly 
on March 14 to the dismissal statement that that he will 
continue to practice law and that he was shocked to learn of 
his dismissal in the paper prior to formal notification by 
his superiors.  Al Thawadi also complained that Deputy 
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Judiciary Shaikh Khalifa 
bin Rashid Al Khalifa refused to meet with him for discussion 
on his dismissal. 
 
4.  (C)  Our ABA legal advisor (strictly protect), who was 
given permission to review the personnel files of the 
dismissed judges, told PolOff on March 15 that Al Thawadi\'s 
dismissal was no surprise.  In our contact\'s opinion, he was 
guilty of several counts of sex coercion. The file had sworn 
statements by law clerks attesting that women were regularly 
scheduled to come after hours to his chambers to \'discuss\' 
their cases.  Some of the women who were scheduled for 
after-hours consultations have pending civil court sexual 
harassment cases against Al Thawadi. 
 
5.  (C)  As for the other judges, our contact told PolOff on 
March 16, that Shaikh Mohsin Al Asfoor was dismissed for 
taking a BD32,000 (USD84,800) bribe and a car from a rich 
businessman in December 2003 and then reneged on his promise 
to rule in the businessman\'s favor on an inheritance dispute. 
 Since the December ruling, the businessman has continued to 
threaten to sue Shaikh Mohsin in an international court of 
justice and gave the judge a February 2004 deadline before he 
would go public.  The businessman copied the Minister of 
Justice, the Crown Prince, and the King on all 
communications. In January 2004, the Minister of Justice 
requested Judge Al Asfoor meet and explain his actions but Al 
Asfoor refused all meetings with Minister Al Arayed. 
 
6.  (C)  Shaikh Abdulla Al Malki\'s file contained evidence of 
both bribery and sexual coercion.  The other judges\' files 
had evidence of sexual coercion. 
 
7.  (C)  Bahraini women activists have responded favorably to 
the dismissals.  The leadership of both the Bahrain Women\'s 
Society and the Al Mustaqba women\'s society said it was high 
time Shari\'a court judges were held accountable for their 
misdeeds.  Founding member of the Women\'s Petition Committee 
(see reftel B) Badriya Rabiah told PolOff on March 17 that 
even though she finally won custody of her children on second 
appeal in January 2004, there are many more dishonest Shari\'a 
court judges who need to be fired.  Plaintiff against Judge 
Shaikh Jassim Al Thawadi, Ghada Jamsheer told PolOff on March 
17 that the sacking of these judges is a step in the right 
direction but that they should serve jail time for rape and 
bribery.  Human rights activist and attorney Fatima Al Hawaj 
stressed to PolFSN on March 17 that the Women\'s Petition 
Committee played a crucial role in revealing the judges\' 
misconduct.  She cited Badria Rabiah\'s case as the watershed 
case that made public the incompetence of Shari\'a court 
judges.  Al Hawaj noted that this is the first of many 
much-needed steps to reform Bahrain\'s judicial system, and 
may set the stage for the drafting of a long awaited personal 
status law. 
 
8.  (C)  COMMENT. The dismissal of corrupt Shari\'a court 
judges is a large step in the right direction for judicial 
reform and protecting women\'s rights in Bahrain.  The 
appointment of eight new judges to the Jaafari Shi\'a Shari\'a 
Courts and a new Advisor to the Supreme Judicial Council, 
suggests more changes are on the way and has the legal 
community buzzing with enthusiasm.  Minister Jawad bin Salim 
Al Arayed appears to be serious about reform.  Our ABA legal 
advisor (strictly protect) recommended criminal prosecution 
of the sacked judges.  Their prosecution, conviction, and 
incarceration would be a powerful symbol that the King is 
committed to the rule of law in Bahrain. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: IT MUST NOT FAIL -- BAHRAIN\'S FORMULA ONE GRAND 
PRIX SECURITY PLAN 
 
Classified By: Robert S. Ford, Charge d\'Affaires,a.i.  Reasons 1.5(B). 
 
 1.  (C)  SUMMARY: On 03/16/2004, RSO coordinated a meeting 
with top MOI officials to discuss the GOB\'s security plans 
for the upcoming 2-4 April 2004 Bahrain Formula 1 (F1) Grand 
Prix.  As the first such motorsport event ever held in the 
Middle East, the Bahrain Grand Prix has captivated the nation 
while presenting monumental challenges to the GOB to have the 
technical and security aspects ready in time.  With an 
anticipated 550 million worldwide viewers and an 
unprecedented domestic capital investment, the Bahrain Grand 
Prix could prove decisive in the country\'s future legitimacy 
as a sporting, business, and tourism destination.  From a 
safety and security point of view, the advisor to the 
Interior Minister stated most candidly to the RSO that F1 
\"will work; it must not fail.  That is not an option.\"  The 
MOI\'s preparations are impressive, and in summary reflect in 
part the participation of several senior MOI officials in ATA 
training courses. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  WHO IS INVOLVED?  The Federation Internationale de 
l\'Automobile (FIA) oversees motorsports and sets the 
standards.  The Formula One conglomerate, headed by Bernie 
Ecclestone, drives event scheduling and enforces technical 
and security requirements for host venues.  For the Bahrain 
Grand Prix, F1 expects 550 million television viewers and 
about 40,000 to 45,000 attendees.  The GOB has heavily 
invested time and money (over BD 56.2 million -- USD $150 
million on facility construction alone) and massively hyped 
this immense multi-national event.  Nearly all tickets are 
sold, according to the senior Ministry of Interior advisor. 
The organizers do not have an idea from where visitors will 
originate as corporations have purchased large blocks of 
seats and distributed them to their clients and staff, 
however.  Noteworthy attendees will include King Abdulla of 
Jordan, the Duke of York, King Mohammed of Morocco, the 
Sultan of Brunei, of course the Bahraini ruling class, and 
countless VIPs and so called \"VVIPs.\"  Gulf Air is the Grand 
Prix\'s major corporate sponsor. 
 
3.  (C)  THE VENUE.  Bahrain had no pre-existing support 
infrastructure or even a motorsport industry before winning 
the bid to host this race.  Out of a stretch of barren, 
southwestern desert, which by driving is 35km from downtown 
Manama, the GOB has created the Grand Prix circuit.  General 
admission guests will watch the race from two main 
grandstands, two temporary grandstands, and a desert standing 
area.  VIPs will observe from either the exclusive \"VIP 
Tower\" or the invitation-only paddock area.  The entire 
facility is surrounded by fencing and the terrain, save a 
small ridge behind the track, is flat and open.  The GOB 
improved and widened the road system leading to the track and 
anticipates altering traffic flows to support increased 
ingress before the races and egress afterwards. 
 
4.  (C)  SECURITY COMMAND AND CONTROL.  The MOI is the lead 
agency for Grand Prix security.  Using a British system to 
designate echelons of command, the MOI Undersecretary is 
designated the \"Gold Commander,\" and overall in charge of the 
security plan.  Subordinate \"Silver\" and \"Bronze\" Commanders 
have assigned disciplines of responsibility such as traffic 
control, stationary and roving posts, quick response forces, 
fire and medical services, public relations, and 
communications.  MOI is working closely with the Bahrain 
National Security Agency (BNSA) to assess potential threats 
as well as to utilize the BNSA\'s Explosive Ordnance Disposal 
(EOD) and search team capabilities.  There will be four 
command centers.  The MOI Operations Room at the MOI \"Fort\" 
is the everyday dispatch and response center for all policing 
and emergency communications.  This is the Undersecretary\'s 
primary watch center and it will always be manned.  A second 
Control Room will be manned at the circuit to coordinate all 
on-scene security and communicate with higher headquarters. 
MOI will also employ a vehicle-based Mobile Control room to 
respond to any \"hot spot\" or remote crisis.  Finally, 
Bahrain\'s National Emergency Control Center (NECC) will be 
stood-up and manned by a multi-agency team on 01 April.  In 
the event of a major crisis or emergency, the NECC supersedes 
all other commands and becomes the primary incident command 
center. 
 
5.  (C)  PHASING-IN THE SECURITY.  Commencing 01 March, the 
MOI suspended all leave for its entire staff.  Every 
policeman and officer is expected to be involved in the Grand 
Prix.  Also, Bahrain Public Security (BPS), the combined 
law-enforcement and security arm of the MOI, has temporarily 
realigned from four shifts to three, thus increasing manpower 
on duty at any given time.  Through three \"Phases,\" the BPS 
is increasing its foot and vehicular patrols, uniformed and 
plainclothes static posts, hotel presence, and staffing 
around downtown, at the airport (doubling its staff), 
causeway, and at the track itself.  200 policemen are 
specially trained for VIP protection and will be fully 
utilized.  BNSA is already bolstering vehicle and personnel 
searches at the airport and causeway.  On 01 April, the day 
before the event starts, all police will be in place.  At the 
track alone, 520 policemen will act as race Marshals.  200 of 
these are actually shifted to the race coordinators\' staff. 
The other 320 will be nondescript as law enforcement officers 
by wearing the race Marshal uniform.  They will perform the 
standard Marshal duties while also observing the crowd and 
reporting any anomalies or problems to the command center. 
Of course, BPS will also staff traditional police posts on 
the F1 complex to address normal police issues like lost 
items, fights, theft, etc.  Every policeman at the track will 
be issued a small \"action card\" that contains a decision 
matrix and contact directives.  In general, access to and 
inside the complex is staffed by the MOI and BNSA.  Outside 
the track perimeter, the MOI and Bahrain Defense Forces (BDF, 
the uniformed military service), will patrol.  The Traffic 
Directorate will very purposefully control vehicular traffic. 
 Unlike the U.S. or the UK, Bahrain is a country where the 
police can simply close a major roadway or make it entirely 
one-way.  Traffic planners intend to do just this to 
facilitate heavy flows into and out of the site.  Also, 
vehicles entering the area surrounding the F1 facility must 
display special access passes that accompany seating tickets. 
 Traffic police will turn-back vehicles without the proper 
credentials.  All MOI assets will begin rehearsals and 
\"Immediate Action\" training several days before the start. 
Interestingly, responsibility for securing the VIP tower has 
been assigned to the Royal Guards, the Royal Court\'s 
bodyguard and security element.  The MOI advisor advised that 
thus far, communication among the usually disparate 
Ministries and agencies has been excellent. 
 
6.  (C)  CONTINGENCY.  The Special Security Force Directorate 
(SSFD, the MOI\'s anti-riot unit and tactical unit) is 
pre-positioning several teams around the country and at the 
venue.  They will remain in a standby posture for the 
duration of the event.  MOI\'s \"Flying Wing\" will keep pilots 
and 2 Bell 412 rescue/evacuation helicopters at the two 
following sites:  the MOI Fort and Sofra, a police camp about 
10km from the F1 track.  The Civil Defense and Fire Service 
is on full standby around the country and will have a heavy 
presence at the track as well.  The Health Ministry has been 
very supportive of MOI\'s contingency planning.  The two major 
trauma centers, Salmaniya and BDF Hospitals, are increasing 
their staffs in the event of a major crisis.  Further, 
Salmaniya has constructed a BD 15,000 (USD $40,000) temporary 
helicopter landing pad on its campus.  The MOI has also 
arranged for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) standby 
response teams. 
 
7.  (C)  STRATEGY AND PHILOSOPHY.  MOI acknowledges that it 
is not possible to completely eliminate all risk.  The 
Undersecretary and his senior advisors are attempting to 
lower the percentages for any would-be attacker or disrupter. 
 As this is such an unprecedented, pivotal, and high-profile 
national event, top leaders are demanding its success.  In 
MOI\'s view, the F1 circuit facility itself is one of the 
least likely targets of a potential attacker.  Any attack of 
significance anywhere in Bahrain could immediately cancel the 
Grand Prix.  For this reason, MOI is compelled to address the 
totality of threats and security around the country as they 
relate to a major event.  The world\'s eyes will be focused on 
the security situation in Bahrain but, the MOI is sensitive 
to not render the Grand Prix a \"Police Event.\"  They will 
maintain a very high, overt police profile outside the 
perimeter, while striving to remain discreet inside. 
Security implementation has already begun with the initial 
phase-in of additional police around town.  As to not shock 
the public, the police will gradually increase staffing 
through three phases.  The MOI has also met with the major 
anti-government political societies and gained their 
assurances to abstain from impeding the visitors or event 
schedule.  Further, commencing 26 March, MOI will begin a 
major public advisory campaign to advise the nation about 
changing traffic patterns, access requirements, and general 
security measures.  MOI considers their strengths to include 
the facts that Bahrain is a small island with limited access 
points, BNSA has generally good intelligence capabilities, 
and all security forces are taking Grand Prix safety and 
security efforts seriously. 
 
8.  (C)  COMMENT:  We were genuinely impressed with the depth 
and breadth of MOI\'s preparations.  The Ministry has been 
working on their plan for months.  Many of the senior 
policy-makers at MOI are products of multiple ATA training 
courses.  Their thought processes (and RSO\'s level of access 
to briefs like this) are direct benefits of ATA-sponsored 
training in Bahrain.  Post\'s three main concerns continue to 
be the \"Bahraini 3\" Sunni extremists at large, security at 
the causeway linking Saudi Arabia to Bahrain, and other 
general soft targets around Bahrain.  Any attack would likely 
cancel the event and jeopardize any future legitimacy for 
Bahrain in the business, sporting, or tourism industries. 
Though we currently know of no specific threat as of yet, 
certainly Post is concerned that the high-profile nature of 
the Grand Prix presents an attractive target for any 
attention-seeking person or group.  RSO will continue to work 
closely with relevant GOB offices to track Grand Prix 
specific threat information.  The MOI directly requested of 
RSO to be kept informed of any/all threat information about 
which we learn.  RSO and other Post Officers will ensure the 
timely passage of threat info to MOI decision-makers.  RSO 
will make available an unclassified version of this report to 
share with U.S. companies and concerned citizens.  END

TAGS: AEMR, AFSI, ASEC, BA, CASC, KESS, OTRA 
SUBJECT: LESSONS LEARNED - MANAMA CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXERCISE 
 
REF: FSINFATC 00912 
 
1. Post benefited from the Crisis Management Exercise (CME) 
by applying the skills and experience of the Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) and participants (LES and non-EAC members) 
with the Emergency Action Plan and Emergency Planning 
Handbook to manage the scenario. Ruth Abramson and Lawrence 
Petroni presented a valuable training evolution for Embassy 
Manama. The following responses are keyed to reftel. 
 
A. Format of the CME: Post recommends changing the CME from 
the no-fault format to assigning a mission capable or 
not-mission capable rating. Embassy employees live and work 
in a dangerous world beset by terrorism, civil unrest and 
crime. At the end of a CME the facilitators should determine 
that a standard of knowledge and competence has been 
demonstrated by the post. This may require a technical person 
be added to the two-person team to inspect equipment, observe 
drills and review plans. Four hours is satisfactory for the 
exercise in its present form. 
 
B. Selection of Scenarios: The scenario was well developed. 
Ruth Abramson did an excellent job of coordinating with post 
to create a well thought out civil unrest, anthrax and soft 
target bombing exercise. The scenario of most concern for the 
EAC is an attack on a housing compound or apartment complex. 
The exercise provided a timely opportunity to test our 
personnel and plans. 
 
C. Appropriateness of intervention by the controller: The 
controller established guidelines and set the tone for the 
scenario. The A/DCM led the 30 plus participants through the 
CME on pace, included all sections in discussions and 
delegated action/responsibility. The controller responded 
promptly to questions and explained situations well. 
 
D. What would post do differently in response to a real 
crisis as a result of this training? More effectively plan 
shift schedules for personnel to reduce exhaustion and 
stress, include U.S. Navy personnel earlier in the crisis and 
consider requesting FEST, SST and Consular assets from 
Washington. 
 
E. What lessons did post take away from the CME? Security for 
the Bahrain School (30/750 students are from the Embassy) is 
managed by the U.S. Navy. Post also has two dependent 
children at the St. Christopher School. Post will obtain 
copies of emergency procedures from both schools to share 
with parents. Post will widen the distribution of 
responsibilities for Emergency Action Functions (section 121) 
to include all agencies represented at the Embassy. What best 
practices for crisis management emerged? Post prepared well 
for Operation Iraqi Freedom last year acquiring sufficient 
quantities of medical supplies and chem-bio equipment and 
conducting frequent drills. Embassy Manama requested and was 
granted authorized departure status in February 2003. Long 
before going on authorized departure status, all personnel 
had gone through a series of dry run training evolutions to 
assemble individual evacuation paperwork, create evacuation 
orders, discuss State regulations and complete applications 
for allowances. This level of readiness prepared the Embassy 
well for a variety of emergency situations. Have you 
formulated an action plan to deal with issues that arose 
during the CME? The A/DCM assigned section heads to address 
the issues noted above and report their findings to the EAC. 
 
F. What aspects of the stand-alone CMT Overview Training did 
post find useful? The stand-alone CMT Overview Training was 
deferred at the Charge\'s request to conduct a CME 
seminar/question and answer session for the abundant first 
tour and junior officers at post. The CME team reviewed the 
USG assets available to posts and answered questions. The 
junior officers unanimously requested the DS Anti-terrorism 
(crash and bang) course as a prerequisite for overseas 
assignment. Post will institute an in-house CME twice a year 
for the EAC and staff. The CME will familiarize personnel 
with the EAP and EPH, update assignments and contact 
information, allow post to acquire equipment for emergencies 
and develop bench strength. 
 
G. Frequency of CME: Every two years is appropriate. Posts 
with the highest threat levels should exercise annually. 
 
H. Comments: Preparing for the CME was a benefit. RSO 
conducted a CME overview for all employees and held a 
compressed table top exercise to get people in a CME state of 
mind. Post recommends USG personnel assigned overseas attend 
the two-day CME leadership workshop once every five years. 
FSI should create a best practices site on the web page based 
on controller observations from previous exercises. The web 
site is very good and has useful information.

SUBJECT: ISLAMIC YOUTHS CONDUCT FIERY RAMPAGE AT A MANAMA 
RESTAURANT 
 
Classified By: CHARGE ROBERT FORD FOR REASONS 1.4 (c) 
 
1.  (C)  Bahrain Police sources advised RSO that an enraged 
crowd of 50 or more Islamist teenagers ransacked La Terrasse 
restaurant for serving alcohol and burned the cars of seven 
customers in Manama on Wednesday March 17. Conservative 
Muslim youths assembled from five villages (Adari, Jid Hafs, 
Sanabis, Chamis and Tashan) in the surrounding area once the 
mayhem began, swelling their number beyond 200. 
 
2. (C) The juvenile offenders came prepared with knives, 
rocks and molotov cocktails. The largest vehicle damaged, a 
Cadillac SUV with Saudi plates, was rolled on its side and 
torched. RSO observed five vehicles burned and two damaged in 
the restaurant parking lot on Thursday morning. Most of the 
vehicles had Saudi license plates. The La Terrasse is a nice 
restaurant surrounded by predominantly Shia neighborhoods. It 
is common knowledge that alcohol is served at this expensive 
eatery, but it does not have the unsavory reputation of the 
establishments attacked last week. 
 
3. (C) The police arrested 12 of the teenagers Wednesday 
evening and detained 4 more for questioning on March 19 
according to the Officer in Charge of the Sanabis Police 
Station. The officer further commented that the 
Undersecretary, Ministry of Interior, Shaikh Daij ordered 
police to identify the principals and make arrests. The 
police responded to the restaurant in adequate numbers but 
did not disperse the crowd quickly. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: This is the second violent anti-alcohol and 
prostitution confrontation with businessmen in as many weeks. 
Manama has been calm since the March 17 incident. The GOB has 
put on a heavy media campaign to denounce this kind of street 
action against perceived dens of inequity.

OF EDUCATION REQUESTS MORE INFO 
 
REFS:  A) STATE 15320, B) BEIRUT 623, 
       C) WENGER/BOURGEOIS EMAILS, D) MANAMA 375 
 
1.  (U)  This is an action request for NEA/PI; please 
see para 6. 
 
2.  (U)  PAO has met twice with senior Ministry of 
Education officials in Bahrain about the MEPI Arabic 
language early reading book program (on February 22 and 
March 16).  The Assistant Undersecretary for Curriculum 
and Training told PAO and APAO on March 16 that the 
Ministry had not yet made a decision about 
participating in the program.  The Ministry would 
welcome a visit from a Scholastics Book Representative 
who would provide further information about the books, 
including a proposed list of titles and sample 
translations. 
 
3.  (U)  It is post\'s understanding that Ms. Michelle 
Alwan, Middle East Area Sales Manager of Scholastics 
Books, will visit the region in April/May.  Post 
recommends that she visit Bahrain with further 
information about the project, including the proposed 
list of books and samples of books that have already 
been translated. 
 
4.  (SBU)  It seems that \"My Arabic Library\" has been 
the talk of the Ministry.  The Assistant Undersecretary 
told the PAO that a number of Ministry staff have 
expressed serious concerns about the project during 
internal meetings, and some have come out completely 
against the project.  The Assistant Undersecretary 
supports the project, stating, \"These people are living 
in the past - aren\'t these just children\'s bedtime 
stories?\"  He cautioned, however, that the Minister 
will decide only after he has met with Alwan and seen a 
list of the books.  During a separate meeting about the 
GLOBE Program on March 21, the Director of Intermediate 
and Secondary Education in Bahrain, the official 
responsible for all public high schools and middle 
schools in the country, surprised the APAO and PAS FSN 
by bringing up \"My Arabic Library\" and stating that he 
was not supportive of the idea.  He said, \"We have been 
discussing this new Arabic Books Program from America. 
We have our own books that reflect our culture and 
traditions, there is little need for us to import.\" 
(Comment:  This individual has been extremely 
supportive of the GLOBE Program, and is not anti- 
American.)  Further, during a round table discussion at 
Al Wasat Arabic newspaper two weeks ago, Charge and 
Emboffs were surprised when a representative from an 
Islamist political society who works at the Ministry of 
Education, used \"My Arabic Library\" as an example of an 
educational reform program being imposed by the USG on 
the Gulf, as reported in reftel D. 
 
5.  (SBU)  PAO informed the Assistant Undersecretary 
that per ref A, para 7, \"acknowledgement of MEPI 
sponsorship of the Program would likely be printed on 
the inside of the books.\"  Given the sensitivities 
surrounding the program, he recommended not overtly 
identifying the books as receiving U.S. funding.  He 
stated, \"Good work speaks for itself and teachers, 
parents, and students could react negatively to this 
program if it seemed to have political connotations. 
Stamping the book cover would be counterproductive to 
the purpose of the program.  Arabs want to preserve 
their cultures and politicizing a reading program 
equals indoctrination in the viewpoint of many. 
Politicizing a reading program takes away its 
substance.\"  (Comment:  This official has been 
extremely supportive of all MEPI initiatives, and he 
personally supports My Arabic Library.  End Comment.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise Alwan\'s 
travel dates to Bahrain so post can request a meeting 
with the Minister of Education for Alwan to present the 
requested information.  Charge Ford and PAO will 
accompany Alwan on the meeting.  Post further requests 
that Alwan be prepared to inform the Minister exactly 
how U.S. support/funding for the books will be 
identified.

     EMAILS 3/16 AND 3/17 
 
Classified By: Robert S. Ford, reason 1.5 B AND D. 
 
1.  (C)  Bahrain will not promptly transfer approximately USD 
47 million in funds from old Iraqi-owned bank deposits to the 
United Nations Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), Finance 
Minister Saif told Charge on March 20.  Charge had urged Saif 
that the issue had been outstanding since the summer of 2003. 
 He noted that previously Saif had informed us that the funds 
would be transferred.  The Bahraini Government\'s credibility 
would suffer just as the American and Bahraini governments 
are trying to finish negotiations on a free-trade agreement, 
Charge warned. 
 
2.  (C)  Saif understood the argument, but said transferring 
the funds would be difficult legally.  He said that the two 
Bahraini banks (Gulf International Bank (GIB) and Arab 
Banking Corporation) which had held the deposits had had 
large, uncollectible claims against the Iraqi Government. 
These two banks years ago had laid claim to the Iraqi 
deposits to off-set losses on the loans they had extended to 
the Iraqi government.  Charge reminded Saif that per UNSCR 
661 of August 1990, the GoB was to have frozen all Iraqi 
funds in Bahrain.  Saif did not dispute this.  He observed, 
however, that the fate of the Iraqi deposits was now a quote 
legal issue unquote in Bahrain.  As such, the Finance 
Ministry had asked the Bahrain Monetary Agency (the BMA - 
Bahrain\'s central bank) for a complete study and report. 
 
3.  (C)  BMA Governor Sheikh Ahmed had told Charge on March 
16 that transferring the funds was not a simple matter. 
Bahraini banks had already counted these deposits against 
larger losses stemming from bad loans made to Iraq. 
Transferring the assets now would, he said, require the two 
Bahraini banks to revise their balance sheets and ultimately 
their shareholders\' profits and capital. 
 
4.  (C)  Deputy Bahraini Finance Minister and Gulf 
International Bank board member Sheikh Ibrahim al-Khalifa 
asserted to Charge over dinner March 20 that the banks had 
taken the offsets in 1992 or 1993.  Charge observed that the 
Bahrain banks\' action apparently came after UNSCR 661, but 
Ibrahim claimed not to know about that resolution. 
 
5.  (C) Charge followed up on March 24 with the BMA Governor 
who said that lawyers from the BMA and the two banks will 
meet next week. He underlined that UNSCRs have legal 
precedence in Bahrain; the GoB will meet its obligations, he 
stressed.  Charge noted that the USG perceives that 
obligation to be the transfer of the assets.  Sheikh Ahmed 
reiterated that Bahrain would meet its obligations, but the 
first step was having the central bank\'s legal team meet with 
the banks to determine what exactly was done to the banks\' 
accounts. 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  The Deputy Finance Minister confided that 
in view of the banks\' actions from more than ten years ago, 
aides to Saif in Bahrain\'s Finance Ministry had cautioned 
Saif not to pledge that Bahrain would transfer the funds as 
he did to us (ref A).  Saif did not want a confrontation with 
the USG then and he assured CDA that he does not now.  The 
Central Bank Governor made the same affirmation. 
Protestations of goodwill aside, we do not expect quick 
resolution of this now old issue.  It is not clear to us yet 
what kind of Iraqi loan-loss provisions the banks made in the 
early 1990s and what the exact legal status of the disputed 
accounts at the Bahraini banks now is.  Above all, we don\'t 
yet sense here a willingness at the Finance Ministry or the 
BMA to compel the two banks to go to their shareholders (Gulf 
state governments mostly) and tell them they will have to 
absorb a USD 47 million loss.  It would be easier for the 
Bahrainis, we think, if we had an authoritative 
interpretation of what UNSCR 661 required exactly of the 
Bahraini Government with respect to Iraqi bank accounts at 
GIB and Arab Banking Corporation back in 1991.  End Comment.

RATIFICATION

Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 1.4(b)(d). 
 
1.(C) Bahrain is serious about ratifying the Article 98 
agreement, MFA Minstate Abdulghaffar assured Charge on March 
23.  The GOB is not deliberately delaying progress, he 
stressed repeatedly; the government is divided between those 
who advocate that the agreement does not have to go to 
parliament, and those who believe the National Assembly must 
ratify it.  The MFA, he emphasized, firmly supports bringing 
the agreement into force without submitting it to the 
National Assembly. 
 
2.(C) The government, Abdulghaffar explained, does not want 
this argument or its signature of the agreement to leak a 
currently fractious parliament.  He related that he had faced 
unexpected criticism during the March 22 Shura (appointed) 
Council debate on the ratification of the counter terrorism 
conventions on the suppression of terrorist financing and the 
suppression of terrorist bombings (septel).  Some \"Islamist\" 
members asked why Bahrainis shouldn\'t provide charity to the 
orphans of Hamas martyrs, he highlighted.  In the present 
climate, he rhetorically argued, it would be better to take 
the agreement to the National Assembly after the GOSI/Pension 
Fund crisis with the House of Representatives is resolved 
(ref b). 
 
3.(C) Abdulghaffar recalled that he had participated in the 
negotiation of the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and 
reiterated that he did not believe that Bahrain would ever 
turn over an American to the International Criminal Court. 
Responding to POL/ECON Chief\'s question, Abdulghaffar stated 
definitively that Bahrain has no intention at this time of 
ratifying the Convention on the International Criminal Court. 
 However, he quickly added that some within the GOB have 
argued that Bahrain should ratify the ICC treaty if it 
ratifies the Article 98 agreement. 
 
4.(C) COMMENT:  Abdulghaffar\'s demarche reflects Bahrain\'s 
domestic political stress from internal disturbances, an 
increasingly aggressive parliament, the approach of the 
Formula 1 race, and the death of Shaikh Ahmed Yassin.  A 
group of university-educated Sunni Bahrainis blasted the U.S. 
for never joining the ICC during Charge\'s March 22 call on 
their political salon.  Charge did not raise with the young 
men -- already angry about the killing of Shaikh Yassin -- 
the Article 98 issue.  Their rejection of our bilateral 
agreement would have been certain.  The MFA obviously fears 
losing a vote in parliament on the article 98 agreement 
ratification.  Given the current local political climate, we 
think pushing the Bahrainis to send a U.S. bilateral 
agreement to parliament now would probably produce a 
parliamentary rejection.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI CROWN PRINCE SAYS SHEIKH YASSIN KILLING 
BLOW TO ARAB REFORMERS 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert Ford, reason 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
 1.  (C)  Bahraini Crown Prince Sheikh Salman told CENTCOM\'s 
General Abizaid March 24 that the killing of Sheikh Yassin 
was a setback to those in the Arab World who want more and 
faster reforms.  Notably, he said the Bahraini Government 
(still the chair of the Arab League) has heard that the Tunis 
Arab League summit may be delayed as a result of the killing. 
 He added that some Arab League members are even shopping the 
idea of withdrawing from the table Saudi Crown Prince 
Abdallah\'s peace initiative until after Israeli PM Sharon 
departs the scene.  Salman also doubted the Tunis summit now 
would do much to address reform issues. 
 
2.  (C)  Salman stressed that without progress on the 
Israel-Palestinian peace process, it would be impossible for 
America\'s Middle East regional reform initiative to succeed. 
Events like the killing of Sheikh Yassin make it easy for 
conservatives who don\'t want change to hold up reform in the 
name of solving the Palestinian problem first.  Too many 
people in the region, he commented, want to blame outsiders 
for their problems, and the Palestinian issue is the perfect 
foil.  He urged the U.S. Government to engage more seriously 
on the peace process to enable reformers to advance their own 
agenda. 
 
3.  (C)  Separately, the host of one of Manama\'s largest 
political salons blasted Charge on the evening of March 22 
over the killing of Sheikh Yassin.  This host, an older and 
very successful, British-educated businessman said Bahrainis 
perceive that a particular lobby is responsible for what he 
labeled America\'s uneven approach to the Arab-Israeli 
dispute.  That lobby does not, he claimed, understand 
America\'s real interests in the region.  If such interest 
groups constitute America\'s vision of democracy, he concluded 
acidly, then people in Bahrain want no part of it.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  For the second time in two weeks, mobs of 
Shi\'a youths ransacked on March 17 a place of \"unethical 
practices,\" destroying an upscale restaurant known to serve 
alcohol.  Similar to last week\'s unruly mob that broke into 
private residences identified as vice dens in two Shi\'a 
neighborhoods, the attack on La Terrasse restaurant was well 
organized.  The Ministry of Interior has vowed zero tolerance 
for this type of behavior in the future, but police response 
on March 17 was slow and indecisive.  The hardline opposition 
has publicly justified these attacks on the moral ground of 
cleaning up neighborhoods after a tone-deaf GOB has refused 
to enforce the law.  Despite Bahrain\'s extensive security 
preparations (ref b), the opportunity to embarrass the GOB 
during the Bahrain Formula 1 race in early April could be too 
much of an opportunity for the Shia extremists to let pass. 
We think more attacks on establishments like La Terrasse 
(i.e. isolated in proximity to a Shi\'a neighborhood) could 
happen.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
IN THE NAME OF MORAL CORRECTNESS 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On March 17, a group of 40-50 Bahraini youths 
approached a residence identified as a vice den, and 
menacingly harassed the owner for selling alcohol out of his 
home.  According to a reliable Embassy contact from the Youth 
Forum (strictly protect) some of the men brushed past the 
owner, checking rooms for alcohol and prostitutes. They 
interrupted two prostitutes at work and made the customers 
flee. Carrying knives, sticks, chains and Molotov cocktail, 
the group proceeded right past the Khamis police station to 
La Terrasse restaurant.  Wearing scarves to conceal their 
faces and chanting \"Haram, Haram\" (Arabic for \"forbidden\") 
some of the juvenile offenders rushed inside, smashing 
everything in sight and attacking patrons.  The press 
reported that a South African customer was injured by a club 
studded with nails and one of the attackers was stabbed in 
the stomach by a customer defending himself.  Most patrons 
fled the premises, but some British and Americans (at least 
4) locked themselves in the restaurant bathroom and called 
the police.  According to one of the co-owners, the raid 
lasted about an hour. 
 
3.  (C)  After the attackers left, those who hid in the 
restaurant bathroom sought refuge at the Ritz Carlton.  They 
told PolOff on March 17 that the police did not respond to 
their telephone calls for help. Restaurant co-owner J.J. 
Bakhtiar (the grandson of former Iranian Prime Minister 
Bakhtiar) told the press that the police stood outside the 
restaurant during the raid for 20 minutes without acting.  A 
close friend of the owner told PolOff on March 18 that the 
owner had received threats in the past but was not threatened 
on this particular night.  Bakhtiar related to PolOff that 
the death threats delivered in Farsi have resumed and 
inspection of the premises on March 18 revealed that the 
attackers doused the back wall of the restaurant with 
gasoline.  Bakhtiar surmised that the attackers planned to 
burn his restaurant to the ground but inexplicably moved on 
before setting the restaurant on fire.  Co-owner Khalid 
Abdulla Hejris recalled that La Terrasse had been last 
attacked on the night of the late Januray Eid al-Adha, 
resulting in a marked loss of business.  Bahktiar related to 
PolOff that the Eid attack involved Molotov cocktails thrown 
on the restaurant roof. 
 
4.  (C)  President of the Youth Forum Rashid Al Ghayib, who 
has excellent contacts among young Shia, told PolFSN on March 
21 that these attacks and those of the week before were 
carefully planned over a long period of time.  Five vice dens 
in the Al Makharga and Al Malkiya areas of downtown Manama 
were raided by Shi\'a youths after weeks of surveillance.  The 
youth completely destroyed the bars and brothels.  At least 
five individuals were injured during the attacks.  Just hours 
after the attacks, one of the assailants posted at 
www.malkiya.com an 8-minute video with a music soundtrack of 
the vandalism. 
 
------------ 
GOB REACTION 
------------ 
 
5.  (C)  The GOB denounced the violence and gave assurances 
that these violent acts will not reoccur.  For example, the 
Chairman of the Council of Representatives Khalifa Ahmed Al 
Dhahrani warned that acts of sabotage and violence harm 
national economic and political reforms, and will take the 
country back to the time of troubles.  The GOB sent the 
Embassy a diplomatic note asserting that the GOB will not 
allow this type of violence to happen again.  The MFA 
MinState told the CDA on March 23, that they will \"not permit 
any kind of disruptions.\"  Undersectary of the Ministry of 
Interior (MOI) Shaikh Daij told RSO on March 22 that security 
forces have entered into Phase One of the Formula One 
security plan.  The increased visible police presence should 
guarantee citizen safety and expand coverage of GOB response 
to any vigilante acts, he said. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
BAHRAINIS CONDEMN VIOLENCE AND BLAME THE POLICE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6.  (U)  Outrage at the attacks reverberated through 
newspaper editorials.  Columnist Ali Saleh argued that 
Bahraini citizens suffer because the GOB won\'t stand up to 
conservative Islamists.  Abdulla Al Ayoobi declared that 
these violent attacks are the direct result of continued 
rhetoric in Parliament that started with the Nancy Ajram 
concert (see reftel f), followed by the shut down of the 
television show \"Big Brother.\" (see reftel c).  The 
indecisiveness of the police to quell the violence gave 
commentator Ahdeya Ahmed, a normally liberal voice in the 
papers, an argument for the GOB to bring back the oppressive 
State Security law to re-empower the police forces. 
 
7.  (C)  Most representatives of political, business, 
religious, and cultural societies condemned the incident at 
La Terrasse as illegal, unjustifiable and irresponsible. 
Prominent Shi\'a religious cleric Shaikh Isa Qassim told the 
press, \"you can\'t fight vice with another vice.\"  In Al Wasat 
on March 22 prominent pro-reform Shia cleric Shaikh Dhia 
Mousawi denounced the violence and addressed the youth, \"by 
doing what you did, you have offered a free service to those 
who want to reinstate oppression and the State Security Law.\" 
 President of the Youth Forum Rashid Al Ghayib told PolFSN on 
March 21 that his constituency condemned the attacks for 
their violence, but also asserted that actions taken were in 
direct response to the police doing nothing to close down 
these vice dens.  Privately, some well-to-do Sunnis 
recognized that the problem results from bad GOB real estate 
zoning decisions.  An Undersecretary in a Ministry told CDA 
on March 22 that La Terrasse was attacked because the GOB 
denies zoning permits to any tourism establishments in Riffa, 
but allows places like La Terrasse to open next to Shi\'a 
neighborhoods.  A prominent businessman told CDA that places 
like La Terrasse with their alcohol and loud patrons are 
provocative because they are not zoned away from residential 
neighborhoods. 
 
------------------------- 
HARDLINERS JUSTIFY EVENTS 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Hardline Shi\'a oppositionists sought to place full 
blame for these incidents on the GOB. After speaking with 
some of the rioters, Al Wifaq President Shaikh Ali Salman was 
quoted in the press claiming that the attack was fueled by 
grievances over lack of jobs, low salaries, politics and 
citizenship.  He blamed the Ministry of Interior for the 
outbreak of violence since it did not respond to the numerous 
complaints from residents about vice dens in Shi\'a 
neighborhoods.  Shi\'a chat rooms echoed with comments.  One 
participant justified the attacks with the complaint that 
while tourism establishments are banned in Riffa (where the 
Al Khalifa royal family lives) they are allowed in Shi\'a 
neighborhoods.  On March 19 the four boycotting opposition 
societies issued a statement to \"Al Ayam\" in which they 
reluctantly rejected the sabotaging of public and private 
properties, but then turned on their heels and justified the 
incidents as \"mere popular reactions to unacceptable national 
actions.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  The hardline Shia opposition within Al Wifaq is on a 
roll.  The \"Martyr\'s Day march on National Day (December 17, 
2003) and February\'s constitutional seminar successfully 
embarrassed the GOB.  Using Sunni Islamist parliamentarians\' 
moralist rhetoric as political cover, they have added to the 
GOB\'s embarrassment with last year\'s Nancy Ajram riots, and 
through the recent attacks on neighborhood purveyors of 
alcohol.  An ineffective police response to the Shia 
vigilantes\' vandalism, arson, assault, and battery, along 
with continued moral outrage at police unwillingness to crack 
down on vice in Shi\'a neighborhoods, leads us to expect more 
vigilante behavior. 
 
10.  (C)  The owner of \"La Cave\" restaurant confirmed what 
the French Ambassador told P/E Chief on March 24 that his 
isolated, upscale, alcohol-serving restaurant has received 
threats that it will be attacked next. The expansion of 
targets from illegal alcohol and prostitution purveyors to a 
legal restaurant in proximity to Shi\'a neighborhoods is 
disturbing, especially as we approach a Formula One race 
(April 14) that is expected to draw thousands of 
hard-drinking European visitors.  The hardline opposition has 
shown a pattern of scheduling major incidents, 
demonstrations, attacks, and conferences, to embarrass the 
GOB.  During F-1, we cannot rule out an attack on morality 
grounds on an isolated restaurant that serves alcohol. END 
COMMENT.

Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 1.4(b)(d). 
 
1.(S) The Foreign Ministry is under increasing parliamentary 
criticism related to the status of Bahrain\'s Guantanamo 
detainees, MFA Minister of State Abdulghaffar complained on 
March 23 to Charge.  Many Islamists, he continued, are now 
accusing the ministry of working with the U.S. to keep the 
Bahrainis in Guantanamo detention.  No one in the parliament, 
Abdulghaffar said, believes that the MFA is talking to the 
USG about the detainees. 
 
2.(S) Abdulghaffar again asked that the USG release the 
detainees to the GOB.  Charge reiterated that the USG would 
consider releasing the Bahrainis if the GOB would put them in 
jail in Bahrain.  Abdulghaffar said he could not promise 
indefinite detention in Bahrain because the law no longer 
allows it.  He did say that he could administratively prevent 
them from ever leaving the island.  Charge countered that the 
freedom given to known extremists in Bahrain already did not 
create confidence in Washington to release GTMO detainees to 
similar status.  Abdulghaffar retreated saying he could only 
seek detention through the courts and requested that the USG 
provide evidence against the detainees that not only could be 
presented to the courts, but to the public as well. 
 
3.(S) COMMENT:  The MFA also gave us a diplomatic note 
requesting the release of the Bahrainis in GTMO.  Our sense 
is that the angst about this is confined to the Foreign 
Ministry which has the responsibility ofinteracting with the 
parliament and its strong Islamist elements.  The MFA can 
show the dipnote -- which in Bahraini eyes is a big deal -- 
to the parliamentarians, for example.  By contrast, neither 
the King (strictly protect) nor the Crown Prince (strictly 
protect) raised GTMO detainees with General Abizaid on March 
24.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATION AT U.S. EMBASSY BAHRAIN 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  On 26 March 2004, approximately 400 to 500 
individuals staged a demonstration outside of the US Embassy 
Manama, Bahrain, purportedly to protest the killing of Sheikh 
Yassin by the Israeli Government.  The demonstrators held a 
short peaceful demonstration in the immediate vicinity of the 
Embassy and quickly moved to a field approximately 300 yards 
from the Embassy.  In what appeared to be a coordinated 
effort, demonstrators began throwing rocks and small pieces 
of concrete at police.  The police responded immediately with 
repeated volleys of teargas and the crowd dispersed. 
Although police and demonstrators continued to engage in 
small skirmishes in the village of Zinj, the police remained 
in control of the area and by early evening calm had returned 
to the streets.  Police reported numerous arrests and one 
injury to a demonstrator.  US Embassy Manama did not sustain 
any damage and there were no injuries to personnel. END 
SUMMARY 
 
2.  On 26 March 2004, at 1630 approximately 150 demonstrators 
assembled on the south side of the Embassy complex and took 
up position on the Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Highway.  The police 
immediately re-routed traffic off of Sheikh Isa Bin Salman 
Highway and stationed riot police in the immediate area. 
This initial group of 150 individuals appeared to be mainly 
students and appeared unorganized and more intent of taking 
photographs of each other than actually demonstrating. 
Within minutes, this group was joined by a larger group of 
300 plus adults who appeared to be much better organized and 
more intent on making themselves heard. Upon arrival of the 
second group, the total crowd of 400 to 500 individuals began 
chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.  RSO staff 
noted that during this time period, numerous Palestinian and 
Hizbollah flags could be seen.  Although the crowd was vocal, 
they remained relatively peaceful and made no attempts to 
attack either the Embassy or riot police stationed in the 
area. 
 
3.  At 1700, the crowd departed the immediate area of the 
Embassy in mass and re-assembled in a field 300 yards to the 
west of the Embassy compound.  After fifteen minutes of 
continued flag waving and chanting, members of the crowd, in 
what appeared to be a determined effort to provoke police, 
began throwing rocks and pieces of concrete.  The police 
responded immediately with numerous volleys of teargas and 
began pursuing the protesters as they dispersed.  Over the 
next hour the police continued to skirmish with small groups 
of protesters as the protesters set fire to trash dumpsters 
and tires in the village of Zinj.  RSO staff counted 
approximately 200 canisters of teargas fired into the area. 
Shortly after 1800, calm appeared to have returned to the 
village of Zinj, police reported an end to the confrontation 
and reopened Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Highway. 
 
4.  Police reported eight arrests and only one injury to a 
demonstrator.  No injuries to police were reported.

DELAY, WONDER ABOUT G-8 INVITE

Classified By: DCM Robert Ford, reason 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U)  This is an action request, see para 5. 
 
2. (C)  Bahrain\'s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin 
Mubarak told the Ambassador on March 29 that the sudden 
postponement of the Arab League summit was a surprise to him 
and the other ministers meeting in Tunisia.  Describing 
details very much along the lines of refs b and c, the 
Bahraini noted that the Tunisian decision was especially 
surprising because the Arab ministers had not reached a quote 
deadlock unquote.  Rather, the Bahraini minister said, the 
assembled Arab ministers thought they were making progress 
which made the Tunisian decision all the harder to understand. 
 
3.  (S) Bahrain\'s King Hamad expressed puzzlement to the 
Ambassador on March 28 about the Arab League summit 
postponement.  He commented that the Tunisians had made the 
decision without consulting, leaving the Bahrainis and other 
Arabs mystified.  Tunisian President ben Ali\'s refusal to see 
the Arab foreign ministers who already were in Tunisia was 
impolite, he noted, and not in keeping with the tradition of 
Arab hospitality.  (Comment:  the King, in very good spirits, 
also noted that he personally finds the Tunisian President 
quiet to the point of off-putting.  He remarked that ben Ali 
never greets Hamad when the two sit next to each other at 
summits.  End Comment.) 
 
4.  (C)  The Bahraini Foreign Minister also regretted that 
the manner in which the Tunisians announced the postponement 
had needlessly caused a public image of Arab disarray. 
Earlier in March several Arab government including the 
Egyptians, Saudis and Bahrainis had recommended delaying the 
summit, especially after the Sheikh Yassin assassination. 
The Tunisians held firm to the date only to cancel now at the 
last moment.  Sheikh Mohammed noted that the Tunisian 
decision itself need not be crippling.  The Arab League 
charter states that summits can be held in a host nation or 
at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo.  The Bahraini King 
is going to see Mubarak in Egypt on March 29 and the 
Bahrainis presume the summit will be held relatively soon in 
Cairo. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment and Action Request:  The King remains 
anxious to help the U.S. Middle East reform initiative, per 
ref a. He and the Foreign Minister both asked whether some 
Arab states would be invited to the G-8 summit in June. 
Ambassador said he had heard nothing specific and promised to 
seek guidance from Washington which he could pass to the King.

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI VIEWS ON IRAQ: WONDERING ABOUT IRAQI 
SHIA, AND SUNNI BUY-IN 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann. Reasons 1.4(B)(D). 
 
1.  (S)  Summary:  Bahrain\'s King Hamad remains concerned 
about the extent of Shia and Iranian influence in Iraq but is 
strongly supportive of our efforts there.  His son the Crown 
Prince urged us to take care with the de-Baathification 
process to avoid alienating Iraqi Sunnis.  The King and Crown 
Prince both recognized that reestablishing the Iraqi state is 
a long-term process.  The Crown Prince commented that he 
could imagine Iraq\'s permanent government set up in 2006 
might look like the Philippines in the 1980s and 1990s: 
pro-Western, no threat to its neighbors but plagued with 
problems of corruption and bad governance.  This outcome, 
while not ideal, would be a big plus over the Iraq of Saddam 
Hussein.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S)  Bahrain\'s King Hamad bin Issa told CENTCOM Commander 
General Abizaid on March 24 that he fears Iraqi instability 
after the turnover of sovereignty to an Iraqi government on 
June 30.  Hamad discounted the political courage of the Iraqi 
Governing Council (IGC) and expected the IGC would not make 
tough political decisions about Iraq\'s future over the coming 
months.  Hamad sharply criticized Ayatollah Sistani for 
engaging too much in politics in such a way that would 
aggravate sectarian divisions in Iraq.  He urged the U.S. to 
be careful of Iran\'s trying to use Iraqi Shia to aggravate 
the situation in Iraq.  General Abizaid assured the King of 
American commitment to reestablishing stability in Iraq.  He 
also highlighted the Coalition\'s effort to build up capable 
Iraqi security forces.  Achieving durable stability in Iraq 
would be a long process, he concluded, and Iraq would need 
the help of the United States as well as its neighbors. 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador explained to the King, Crown Prince and 
Foreign Minister on March 28-29 the key events and issues 
over the next year as it now looks.  The U.S. is committed to 
the June 30 transfer of sovereignty.  The Coalition 
understands that the IGC must be more credible and is looking 
at ways to establish a credible Iraqi authority which will 
receive power on June 30.  The U.N. might be able to offer 
useful ideas and will definitely be part of the process.  At 
the end of 2004 or early 2005, there will be national 
elections to elect a temporary parliament.  In order to 
prepare for those elections, the UN, CPA and the IGC are 
working on a new electoral law and how to establish an 
election commission to oversee the polls.  The temporary 
parliament will then operate under the framework established 
by the temporary administrative law - a \"temporary 
constitution\" designed to compel competing Iraqi groups to 
work together.   The temporary parliament will have a 
three-man presidency and will also name the rest of the 
government.  It also will prepare the draft permanent 
constitution.  Once drafted, that constitution will go to a 
public referendum and if approved new elections to establish 
the new, permanent government will be held.  All three 
Bahraini officials underlined their support for the process 
as laid out. 
 
4.  (S)  Bahrain\'s Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, 
told Ambassador that the Bahraini government has two main 
concerns about Iraq over the next six months.  First, he 
urged that the de-Baathification process in Iraq be 
undertaken in such a way as to not alienate the majority of 
Iraq\'s Sunnis.  Salman commented that with Ahmed Chelabi  in 
charge the odds of alienating most Iraqi Sunnis seem to be 
higher.  Bahrain and other Gulf states want to see Iraq\'s 
Sunnis brought into the process.  The Ambassador noted 
greater contacts in recent months between the Coalition 
Provisional Authority and Sunni leaders, and he pointed to 
Sunni political groupings and associations starting to form 
in order to take a more active role in the future Iraqi 
government.  Second, Salman urged that the United States 
stand up a capable Iraqi defense force to assume a great 
burden on the war against terror in Iraq.  Ambassador Neumann 
pointed to progress to date and assured Salman that 
establishing adequate Iraqi security forces is a high 
priority for the United States and the Coalition. 
 
5.  (S)  Salman observed that rebuilding the Iraqi state 
almost from zero is an enormous challenge.  He mused that 
over the longer term if the United States is successful in 
Iraq, he could imagine that Iraq might resemble the 
Philippines of the 1980s and 1990s. Salman said in this case 
Iraq would be pro-western, and would represent no threat to 
its neighbors. It would have a better record on human rights 
as well.  It also, however, would be plagued with problems of 
poor government and corruption.  Salman concluded that 
despite these shortcoming, such an Iraq would be a vast 
improvement in the strategic picture from what Iraq had 
represented under Saddam and that it could further develop 
over time.

SUBJECT: KING ON MARCH 27 ANNOUNCES GOVERNMENT TO TAKE 
HARDER LINE ON LAW-BREAKERS 
 
REF: A) MANAMA 414 B) MANAMA 409 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann.  Reasons 1.4(B)(D). 
 
1.  (S)  Summary:  Worried about potential protests on the 
eve of the April 4 Formula One race event, the King Hamed 
announced on March 27 that the Government would not tolerate 
lawbreaking or acts of violence.  Many observers and leading 
businessmen, recalling a recent bank robbery and attacks on a 
restaurant and private homes offering illegal liquor, 
welcomed the King\'s promise of a tougher line.  They want the 
King to reestablish what they perceive to be tattered police 
authority and deterrent capability.  Privately with us, the 
King stressed that the GoB would prevent any violent 
demonstrations at the Embassy or elsewhere in Bahrain.  The 
Crown Prince told us the issue is violence, not verbal 
expression of opposition to the Government.  The Crown Prince 
pledged the government would adhere to the rule of law.  If 
the hardline Shia opposition generates any protests which 
devolve into violence, the government may well respond by 
banning the main Shia opposition party in a move it thinks 
would secure Bahrain\'s image as a safe place to live and 
work.  We have cautioned that arresting and prosecuting 
lawbreakers is laudable and necessary, but it will be harder 
for foreign observers to understand banning a political 
group.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U)  Bahrain\'s King Hamad bin Isa in a national address 
aired on Bahraini TV on March 27 said the Government would 
crack down on criminals and individuals responsible for acts 
of violence.  The King said violent demonstrations would not 
be tolerated.  Pro-government newspapers rolled out 
editorials on March 28 praising the King\'s remarks and urging 
citizens not to put the Bahrain\'s political reform process at 
risk by resorting to crime or violence. 
 
3.  (S)  Bahrain\'s Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, 
told the Ambassador on March 28 that the Bahraini government 
would begin taking a tougher line against criminals and 
political extremists. Salman said that the government\'s 
repeal of the state security law, and its wide-sweeping 
authorities, had caused problems for the police who had used 
it as a crutch to fight crime.  Without the security law, the 
police had been unable to use regular laws to hold and 
prosecute lawbreakers. He claimed that to his knowledge no 
orders had ever been issued to the security services not to 
arrest people. The King, Salman said, is now urging security 
services to toughen up their enforcement of regular Bahraini 
laws.  Salman underlined that the government and its security 
services would operate within the confines of existing 
Bahraini law.  The government is committed to the rule of 
law, he concluded. 
 
4. (S)  Later on March 28 the King confirmed to the 
Ambassador that his March 27 speech to the nation represented 
a change in tone and tactic with respect to extremists in 
Bahrain.  The King said he was unhappy that hard-line Shia 
opposition members had organized demonstrations at the 
American Embassy (ref a).  He said he had passed a message 
back to the hard-line Shia Al-Wifaq opposition group\'s 
leader, Shaikh Ali Salman, that if the extremists push too 
hard on demonstrations at the American Embassy the King would 
ask the Americans to take over security around the Embassy 
with the implied threat that the Americans would be much 
tougher than the Bahraini security.  (Note:  the King does 
not/not intend to ask us to defend ourselves.  He is simply 
making clear that further threats will not be tolerated.  The 
Minister who actually passed the messaged described them to 
us in identical terms.)  The King said that they would begin 
tougher enforcement of the law against extremists, but would 
not arrest people merely for expressing disagreement of 
opinion with the government.  The King added that he had 
visited the Bahraini Defense Forces headquarters on March 27. 
There he had given the senior army commanders a simple 
message:  Those who are unable or are unwilling to enforce 
the law need to tell us so we can make alternate 
administrative arrangements for them. 
 
5.  (S)  The King discounted the likelihood of a strong 
confrontation with the hard-line opposition in Bahrain.  He 
noted that already some of the more moderate elements of 
Al-Wifaq are leaving the group.  (He pointed to the departure 
from the Al-Wifaq ward of businessman Nizar Al-Baharna and 
Shaikh Abdul Al-Nabi Al-Dirazi.)  The King concluded that the 
break-up of Al-Wifaq would be a good thing as it would 
isolate extremists in Bahrain. 
 
6.  (C)  Two of Bahrain\'s leading businessmen told the DCM on 
March 28 that the harder line taken by the King and the 
government is very welcome. They noted that a recent bank 
robbery as well as a recent attack on a Manama restaurant 
(ref b) indicated that extremists felt they could act with 
impunity.  It was urgent, they thought, for the government to 
reinforce its authority and deter law breakers.  However, 
another top GOB official and a leading businessman echoed 
these sentiments, but added that this time the King will have 
to follow through or lose all credibility. 
 
7.  (C)  A reliable Embassy contact present at a 
well-attended al-Wifaq meeting on March 28 told Poloff that 
al-Wifaq leader Ali Salman urged al-Wifaq followers to avoid 
violence or provocation.  Salman also, however, expressed 
understanding of Shia frustrations in Bahrain and defended 
the people\'s right to express themselves.  (Our source 
wondered if that wasn\'t an implicit green light to more 
provocation.)  Ali Salman also told the Wifaq meeting that 
the Government has warned al-Wifaq that any al-Wifaq 
demonstration, protest or even petition drive could trigger 
the GoB to ban al-Wifaq entirely. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  A close advisor to the King told 
Ambassador March 27 that some in the Government are beginning 
to ponder whether they should ban hardline opposition groups 
like al-Wifaq.  The Ambassador cautioned that arresting and 
prosecuting lawbreakers is laudable and necessary, but 
shutting down political groups would be harder for foreign 
observers to understand.  If al-Wifaq can control its 
followers, we do not anticipate the GoB will move to shut it 
down or arrest its leaders.  However, the GoB is now keenly 
sensitive to the risk that political protests or violence 
during next week\'s Formula One racing event would harm 
Bahrain\'s image as a safe place to invest, work and live. 
The government is now much more sharply focused on al-Wifaq 
elements as a potential instigator of protests and/or 
violence.  Formula One and Bahrain\'s image are probably more 
important to the Government at this moment than plaudits 
about its political reform process.  End Comment.

1. (U) Post\'s MEPI working group met on March 23 to review 
ref A.  The following is the Mission\'s response. 
 
CROSS PILLAR 
 
2. (U) Post\'s MEPI working group is considering four MEPI 
small grants.  Post will advise MEPI of details via email 
per reftel. 
 
ECONOMIC PILLAR 
 
3. (U) In conjunction with the FTA negotiation process, a 
U.S. interagency team is coordinating with the Government of 
Bahrain to identify and prioritize Bahrain\'s trade-related 
technical assistance needs to implement FTA effectively. 
 
4. (U) Post welcomes the continued funding of the MEET U.S. 
program.  Last year, post sent two participants to the MEET 
U.S. hospital administration program.  The program was 
timely, giving post the opportunity to respond positively to 
a Ministry of Health request for USG technical assistance to 
foster its hospital administration reorganization.  Post has 
one request in conjunction with the MEET U.S. program: 
paperwork reduction.  Given stretched resources at post 
(which will only be stretched further with FTA 
implementation), it would be helpful if the officer 
paperwork required to follow up on the interview process 
could be reduced to a single page of the most pertinent 
information (e.g., officer assessments, vice information 
already covered in the candidates\' paperwork) that the 
Washington MEET U.S. team needs to make its candidate 
selection.  This reduction will make it easier for busy 
posts to review and submit applications for the program. 
 
POLITICAL PILLAR 
 
---------------------------------- 
NDI CONTINUES TO BE IN HIGH DEMAND 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Post fully supports funding for regional campaign 
schools. 
 
6. (U) NDI\'s solid reputation for delivering quality 
programming is attracting demand for NDI\'s services from 
across Bahrain\'s political spectrum.  The Secretary General 
of Bahrain\'s Supreme Council for Women recently asked NDI\'s 
local representative to develop a training program for women 
active in politics.  The Minister of the Royal Court, who 
sponsors NDI\'s presence in Bahrain, invited NDI to develop a 
curriculum to train government officials to respond more 
effectively to parliamentary questioning and other 
requirements of a democratic government.  National Assembly 
members highly value NDI\'s activities and are constantly 
asking EMBOFFs to increase NDI interventions with Assembly 
members and staff.  More recently, Bahrain\'s constellation 
of political societies asked NDI\'s local representative to 
facilitate a \"retreat\" to foster dialogue on the country\'s 
political future.  We think this event could begin a process 
that could heal the split in Bahrain\'s political elite that 
emerged after the promulgation of the 2002 constitution. 
Post encourages NEA/PI to make a large allocation to NDI to 
support the development of political organizations in 
Bahrain. 
 
7. (SBU)  On March 25, NDI permanently transferred 
parliamentary specialist Audrey McLaughlin from Bahrain to 
Morocco because of insufficient funds to support her 
presence here.  McLaughlin\'s departure leaves a large hole 
in our democracy support line-up and limits our ability to 
respond to demand.  We hope NEA/PI can increase funding for 
NDI democracy support activities this fiscal year.  NDI is, 
right now, the only quality service provider in town.  If it 
cannot meet the demand, local officials will turn to NDI\'s 
competitors, like UNDP, which provides a higher cost service 
with very weak democracy content. 
 
----------------------- 
HERE WE GO AGAIN - IFES 
----------------------- 
 
8. (U) Election Assistance (IFES).  Post can support a 
senior IFES official\'s visit to approach GOB officials to 
offer a project assessment.  If the GOB formally accepts 
this offer, the Embassy can support the conducting of an 
IFES study.  Bahrain\'s next elections are scheduled for FY05 
and FY06.  The GOB is proud of its election administration 
system and has never asked us, or anyone else for that 
matter, for assistance to improve what the GOB believes to 
be a very successful system. 
 
9. (U) IFES also must overcome a significant credibility 
problem with the GOB.  A previous project here ended badly 
and left some key GOB officials very bitter towards the 
organization. (see refs B AND C).  We feel boosting funding 
for NDI would be a better use of additional MEPI democracy 
spending in Bahrain. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
PARLIAMENTARY STRENGTHENING - ONE NGO ONLY, PLEASE 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10. (U) Post has reviewed this IRI proposal, of which the 
bulk of its funding goes to Morocco and Jordan.   Secondary 
project goals for the Gulf States encourage multi-party 
political systems and increase the numbers of candidates for 
political office.  NDI Program Manager Fawzi Guleid has been 
successfully achieving these goals for the last 18 months in 
Bahrain.  Guleid is well-respected and a much sought after 
commodity in Bahraini society.  Post strongly suggests that 
MEPI increase funding to NDI for parliamentary strengthening 
activities, rather than introduce another U.S. NGO.  Bahrain 
is a small place and we have a small embassy with limited 
resources.  Supporting more than two major political 
activities here (NDI and ABA) is beyond current Embassy 
resources to oversee. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE ABA - A GOOD FIT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Judicial and Legal Reform (ABA). MEPI currently 
funds the American Bar Association\'s judicial reform project 
in Bahrain.  The four main areas of reform are case 
management, alternative dispute resolution, prosecutor 
training and judicial training. The ABA and the Minister of 
Justice are currently negotiating a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) that outlines how ABA can achieve the 
goals and objectives of the reform project.  Once the MOU is 
signed between the ABA and the MOJ, Post strongly recommends 
continued funding for this ABA program. 
 
--------------- 
CIVIC EDUCATION 
--------------- 
 
12. (U) Post strongly supports continuing funding for Arab 
Civic Education Programs.  The Project Director visited 
Bahrain in February and we are awaiting follow up to the 
first visit. 
 
----- 
MEDIA 
----- 
 
13. (U) Post concurs with MEPI\'s decision to evaluate the 
results of the InterNews media training program prior to 
investing further in this project.  We welcome other 
initiatives to support the emergence of a transparent and 
independent media and to continue to reach out and engage 
the next generation of media professionals.  Post encourages 
MEPI to consider projects with broad exposure to U.S. media, 
such as U.S.-based internships for communications students 
and short-term fellowships/professional development 
opportunities for  established journalists who cannot leave 
their jobs for a long period of time. 
 
---------------- 
EDUCATION PILLAR 
---------------- 
 
14. (U) Post is awaiting Ministry of Education approval of 
the \"My Arabic Library\" program.  Representatives from 
Scholastic Books will visit post April 18-21 to meet with 
Ministry officials about the program.  Depending on the 
Ministry\'s response, we may want to participate in expansion 
of the program to other grade levels. 
 
15. (U) Post strongly supports continued (and increased) 
funding of the student leaders program.  We have had 
outstanding candidates for these programs and the   Ministry 
of Education and University of Bahrain have emphasized that 
leadership opportunities for students are among their 
highest priorities as well.  ECA\'s excellent management and 
oversight of these programs has been key, in post\'s view. 
 
16. (U) Post enthusiastically supports the University 
Linkages Program and its continuation.  We currently oversee 
two very productive MEPI linkages with the University of 
Bahrain.  (Comment:  The University\'s Vice President 
recently told the PAO:  \"We have dozens of relationships on 
paper with other universities, but the two MEPI linkages are 
the most successful ones we\'ve had - they are really 
accomplishing something.\"  Kudos to ECA since both linkages 
were initiated by former U.S. Fulbright professors who 
taught at the University of Bahrain.)  Post has requested 
that these linkages be extended in FY 04 via sep email.  We 
appreciate MEPI\'s rapid response to our request, which 
included explicit instructions on what the U.S. institutions 
need to do to apply for extensions. 
 
17. (U) Post strongly agrees with MEPI\'s decision to 
postpone expansion of CRI in Bahrain.  Due to the structure 
of the Ministry of Education, the Child Centered Schools 
program is unworkable in Bahrain.

WOMEN\'S PILLAR 
-------------- 
18. (U) Embassy Manama welcomes the opportunity to 
facilitate the participation of Bahraini women in regional 
MEPI women\'s pillar programs. 
 
19. (U) Post strongly supports continuation of the Business 
Internships Program for young business women.  It is our 
understanding that Bahrain will be able to send only one 
intern during the first year of the program due to funding 
constraints.  Given FTA negotiations and the importance of 
increasing the private sector in Bahrain, we would like to 
request that Bahrain be able to send up to three interns in 
the next year of this program.

SUMMARY 
 
1.(C)  On March 22, Bahrain\'s legislature approved 
ratification of the international conventions on the 
suppression of terrorist financing and terrorist bombings. 
According to the GOB\'s top international lawyer, the GOB has 
sent three other counterterrorism agreements to parliament 
for approval to ratify.  The lawyer said Bahrain is drafting 
a new counterterrorism law based on Canada\'s and South 
Africa\'s laws because they criminalize all terrorist acts 
listed in the 12 international conventions.  The GOB believes 
this approach will win National Assembly approval.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPROVES RATIFICATION OF TWO 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS 
 
2.(U)  The press reported that Shura Council voted on March 
22, in favor of Bahrain\'s ratification of the International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terror and 
the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist 
Bombings.  During discussion of the conventions, newspapers 
reported that some members said that there should be a clear 
definition of what constitutes a terrorist organization.  One 
paper quoted First Vice-Chairman Abdul Rahman Jamsheer as 
saying, \"Organizations such as Hamas, for example, are 
considered terrorist organizations by the U.S. and other 
Western countries but not in the Arab World.  A clear 
distinction should be made between groups like Hamas which 
are fighting against occupation and others like Al Qaeda, 
which are involved in international terror and don\'t enjoy 
popular support in Bahrain or most of the Arab World.\"  The 
press also reported that Member Faisal Fulad said that steps 
should be taken to protect Islamic banks and institutions, to 
prevent them being victimised and to protect one of the most 
important business sectors in Bahrain. 
 
3.(U) According to the press, Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Dr. Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar, who represented the 
government during the debate, said the agreement would not 
prevent aid from reaching people in genuine need.  However, 
he reportedly cautioned that \"Bahrain must follow 
international standards when it comes to providing financing 
for the Palestinians or other similar causes because we don\'t 
want the funds to be used for anything other their intended 
purpose which has happened in the past.\" 
 
THREE MORE CONVENTIONS SENT TO PARLIAMENT 
 
4.(C) Director of Agreements and Treaties for the Directorate 
of Legal Affairs Jameel al-Alawi (strictly protect) told P/E 
Chief that once he receives the paperwork on the two 
agreements from the National Assembly, his office would 
prepare them for signature by the King.  He did not expect 
this to take long.  Al-Alawi added that the government has 
forwarded to the National Assembly for authorization to 
ratify the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons Including 
Agents, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, and the Protocol 
for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of 
fixed Platforms Located on the Contintental Shelf.  Al-Alawi 
said the government has not yet begun the bureaucratic 
process for sending the Convention against the Taking of 
Hostages and the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material to the parliament for approval to ratify. 
 
NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LAW BEING DRAFTED 
 
5.(C) After the brief on the progress on CT convention 
accession, al-Alawi volunteered out of the blue that he is 
involved in the drafting of a new counterterrorism law that 
is based on the Canadian and South African versions of the 
Commonwealth model counterterrorism law.  Al-Alawi said that 
unlike the Jordanian or Moroccan counterterrorism laws (which 
he said he reviewed and rejected as inadequate models), the 
Commonwealth model is comprehensive in criminalizing every 
offense catalogued in the 12 international CT conventions. 
The government, he said, hopes to have the law ready to go to 
the National Assembly once Bahrain has acceded to all 12 
conventions.  The GOB has adopted this approach, al-Alawi 
said, to forestall parliamentary argument against the law. 
The government believes it will be easier to overcome 
opposition when it can point to the National Assembly\'s 
previous votes in favor of accession to the conventions. 
 
COMMENT 
6.(C) After months of pressing the GOB to move forward on 
both ratification of the counterterrorism conventions and the 
drafting of counterterrorism legislation, this is welcome 
news, especially if the new counterterrorism law criminalizes 
planning a terrorist act.  END COMMENT.

PUBLIC STATEMENT MONDAY NIGHT 
 
REF: STATE 74537 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford, reason 1.4 (a) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  Bahraini Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
Abdelghaffar expressed strong (verbal) support for Coalition 
operations to contain Muqtada Sadr and the Jaysh al-Mahdi. 
Charge stressed the challenge Sadr represents in Iraq and the 
need for a forceful Coalition response.  Abdelghaffar agreed 
that the Coaltion needs to restore stability and bring law 
and order to Iraq.  Charge pressed hard for a Bahraini public 
statement of support for Coalition operations.  The Minister 
understood the request and said he would seek guidance. 
 
2.  (C)  Charge also called the MFA Assistant Undersecretary 
Sheikh Abdelaziz bin Mubarak (the younger brother of the 
Bahraini Foreign Minister and a member of the ruling 
al-Khalifa family with consistently good contacts at the 
Palace) to make the same points.  Charge emphasized our need 
for a Bahraini public statement of support given the likely 
greater profile of our military operations.  Abdelaziz said 
issuing a public Bahraini statement made sense to him, and he 
promised to relay our request immediately to the Foreign 
Minister. 
 
3.  (C)  Comment:  The Bahrainis were noticeably uninformed 
about what occured on the ground in Najaf and Baghdad on 
Sunday.  (Their attention has been focused totally on their 
Grand Prix racing event April 4.)  As we have reported 
previously, the GoB is keenly interested in Iraq\'s Shia 
community and the relative balance of power in Iraq.  We 
think they will pay more attention to the Iraq news now, and 
that they will be supportive on operations to restrain Sadr. 
If we don\'t get a public statement on April 5, Charge will 
press again at a higher level on April 6.

REF: STATE 27837 
 
 
Answers are keyed to questions in reftel.  Answers to 
questions a, b, and e were provided by the Director 
General of Customs, Ali AlMahmeed. Questions c, d, f, g, 
h, i,and j were answered by the Advisor for Industrial 
Planning at the Ministry of Industry, Abdul Aziz AlKaabi. 
 
 
a) Does the country have any type of customs free zone, 
free trade zone, foreign trade zone, export processing 
zone, freeport or manufacturing bonded warehouse? 
There are Duty Free Zones in the towns of Hidd and Sitra 
hosting export processing and trans-shipment businesses. 
The only planned free zone including ports and industry 
will be located in Hidd following its completion in 2006. 
The Customs Directorate facilitates bonded warehousing 
for storage of goods only under the authority of Customs 
and if the company seeks to use Bahrain as its trade hub. 
 
How many zones are there currently? 
1 in its final stages of completion (Hidd). 
 
Are there geographic limitations as to where they can be 
located? 
Only 1 is being developed so far; however some 
authorities refer to Bahrain as duty free due to Customs\' 
case by case approach to dealing with duties.  They also 
cite that no duties are levied on exports or on goods 
temporarily imported before trans-shipment. Additionally, 
all raw materials and equipment for manufacturing in 
Bahrain gain duty relief under the Protection and Support 
Law. Exemptions are also available on goods stored in 
bonded warehouses. 
 
Are they successful? 
Not yet evident. 
 
b) How is the zone authority structured? 
The zone authority for Hidd port is yet to be formed. 
However, according to Customs, the zone will be under a 
Director General of Free Zones, which will be under the 
authority of the President of Customs, Ports, and Free 
Zones, who works for the Ministry of Finance and National 
Economy. 
 
Is it part of the Customs Administration, or is it a 
separate government or non-government agency? 
The zone will be part of the Customs Directorate. 
 
Is this zone federally or locally administered? 
It will be administered through the Customs Directorate 
under the Ministry of Finance and National Economy. 
 
Are they considered enclaves that are outside of the 
country or are they Customs-controlled? 
The zone will be operated within the rules and regulation 
of the Customs Directorate. 
 
c) Is a license or other type of authority required for 
each manufacturing activity in the zone? 
Yes, a license will be required from the Ministry of 
Industry for manufacturing activities in the Hidd 
Industrial Park. 
 
If so, roughly how long does the process of obtaining a 
license take? 
The Ministry of Industry in conjunction with Supreme 
Economic Council has promoted a one-stop-shop formula for 
industries seeking to establish operations in Hidd\'s 
industrial park. Officials from the ministry note that 
80% of all licenses can be processed and verified within 
approximately 24 hours, however the remaining 20% 
represent other licenses that are classified as strategic 
for which verification may take slightly longer. 
 
d) Can businesses manufacture products in the zone? 
Yes businesses will be able to manufacture in the 
industrial park. 
 
Can they manufacture using both foreign and domestic 
inputs? 
Unclear, yet to be defined. 
 
Can the merchandise be sold in the home market? 
Industries will be export oriented, but yet unclear if 
goods can be sold in the home market. 
 
e) What are the Customs benefits related to manufacturing 
or processing in the zone? 
Duty free export and transit; dity-free import of raw 
materials. 
 
Can merchandise be imported and re-exported duty-free? 
Yes. 
 
Is duty payable on manufactured merchandise upon leaving 
the zone for the home market? 
No. 
 
If so, is duty payable on the entire value of the product 
or are there exemptions for domestic components and 
domestic value added? 
Unclear, yet to be defined. 
 
When a product that is manufactured in the zone is 
brought into the home market, does the manufacturer pay 
duties at the rate that applies to the finished product 
or at the rates that apply to the components that where 
brought into the zone? 
Unclear, yet to be defined. 
 
Or, does a manufacturer have a choice between the two 
rates? 
Unclear, yet to be defined. 
 
Is capital equipment used for zone manufacturing activity 
permitted entry free of duty? 
Yes. 
 
f) Are there any special provisions for small and medium- 
sized businesses? 
Provisions for small and medium-sized business are a work 
in progress, but will fall under the authority of a new 
department dealing with small industries and crafts. 
 
Or, for new foreign direct investment? 
Yes, but yet to defined. 
 
g) Are there any tax exemptions? (i.e., exemptions from 
tax on merchandise, income, real property) 
Bahrain levies neither personal nor orporate income 
taxes.   There is no VAT, nor property tax. 
 
h) Are there any other financial incentives? (loans 
funding for infrastructure or facilities, subsidies on 
rent, utilities) 
Yes, subject to WTO commitments, Bahrain will offer 
financial incentives, including duty-free raw materials, 
subsidized utilities (NOTE: Bahrain subsidizes power and 
water to all consumers.  END NOTE), and assistance with 
funding facilities through development banks and the 
Bahrain Business Incubator.  Bahrain is a major financial 
center, so low-cost capital is readily available. 
 
i) Are there exemptions from other laws or regulations? 
(environmental, labor laws, nonproliferation export 
controls) 
Legal regulatory exemptions may be dealt with in a case- 
by-case basis. 
 
j) Are there any restrictions or requirements, such as 
export requirements, local content requirements, or 
ownership requirements? 
Ministry of Industry will assess restrictions and 
requirements on a case-by-case basis but will remain 
flexible.

but we can perceive no change in Bahraini tone yet.  It looks 
like it will be an uphill battle to secure these Bahraini 
voting abstentions; the Bahrainis don\'t like to make waves 
and they don\'t like to break Arab ranks.  We should be 
prepared to make continued passes at the Bahrainis here and

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN SET TO BEGIN UTILITIES PRIVATIZATION 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: The Government is looking to partial 
privatization of its power and water sector to meet rising 
demand when the GoB cannot support the construction of new 
power plants. Beginning with a new power plant currently 
under tender, the GoB intends to privatize subsequent power 
and water production and management, while maintaining 
control over supply.  There is some concern among experts 
that the details--subsidies and competition between state 
and private companies--have not been worked out 
sufficiently.  Nevertheless, the GoB needs to undertake 
measures now to meet increasing demands in the near future. 
It is using two concurrent conferences, Water Middle East 
and Power-Gen Middle East, to drum up interest in the 
sector. These conferences will also afford U.S. companies 
access to this important regional market.  END SUMMARY 
 
---------------------- 
Utility Considerations 
---------------------- 
 
2. Power demand in Bahrain has been growing approximately 8 
percent per year, Minister of Finance and National Economy 
Abdulla Saif told the Shura Council at their weekly session 
on April 5 according to local April 6 press reports.  This 
growth in demand requires the state to invest in new power 
facilities every 2 to 3 years, according to statistics 
published by the Ministry of Electricity and Water. 
Likewise, current fresh water supply just meets demand, with 
essentially no excess capacity.   The current building boom, 
population growth and economic activity are expected to 
drive demand higher.  An Ernst and Young study commissioned 
by the Crown Prince in 2003 indicated that Bahrain would be 
in urgent need of a new power generating facility by 2006. 
 
3. Increasing concerns over spiraling costs, strains on the 
national budget, and interests in energy security have been 
driving the Government of Bahrain (GOB) to consider 
seriously the privatization of its power and water utilities 
as it strives to meet rising demand, former Undersecretary 
of Electricity and Water and current President of the 
Business Promotion Center Jamil Al-Alawi told EconOff March 
27.  In keeping with the suggestions of the Ernst and Young 
study, the GOB is embarking on an incremental privatization 
strategy beginning with the construction in 2006 of a new, 
third power plant in the town of Hidd.  From then on, new 
power or power/water facilities would be privately financed 
and managed, with the GoB retaining control over 
distribution, Dr. Nabeel Al Muskati, Assistant 
Undersecretary for Planning and Projects at the Ministry of 
electricity and Water, explained to Econ FSN on March 29. 
 
4. Plans to privatize the sector have not completely 
factored in commercial interest and profit motives, Al-Alawi 
explained to EconOff March 27. Since power cannot be stored 
long term, a private facility would have little interest in 
building up production capacity beyond the minimum 
requirements, leaving the government to find ways to meet 
demand during the peak summer season.  Al-Alawi maintained 
that a nimble private-sector provider will be able to reduce 
operating costs by 30 percent over that of ungainly 
government management, thus offsetting the GoB subsidy. 
Efficient sector management ensure sufficient distribution 
of power and supply stability, he said. The current Ministry 
of Electricity and Water privatization plan approved by 
Bahrain\'s Cabinet in December 2003 allows for a tender to 
construct a privately managed 1000MW power-only facility 
known as Al Azel in the Northeast town of Hidd on Muhurraq 
Island, Al Muskati told EconFSN March 29. The Ministry has 
stipulated its intention to retain authority over 
distribution while reserving the authority of production and 
management to the private company under a 20-year power 
selling agreement. 
 
5. COMMENT: GoB interest in power and water innovation is 
underlined by two upcoming trade shows.  Bahrain will host 
Water Middle East for the second year, from September 13 to 
15, this time in conjunction with Department of Commerce 
approved Power-Gen Middle East.  U.S. Embassy Manama, in 
conjunction with the U.S. Consulate Dhahran and U.S. Embassy 
Doha, will host a catalog show at this event, to facilitate 
U.S. company presence at this event.  Together with the 
upcoming FTA with Bahrain and regional interest, this 
exhibition will provide an excellent opportunity for 
companies seeking to operate in the sectors, potentially in 
areas of consulting, construction, management, and 
distribution, alongside the associated logistical and 
support related equipment required.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI SHIA INITIALLY COOL ON MUQTADA AL-SADR 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d) 
 
1.  (C)  Even if Coalition operations to arrest Muqtada 
Al-Sadr result in his death, Bahraini Shia are unlikely to 
react violently.  On April 7 POL Section polled a wide 
spectrum of Shia contacts regarding the spike in violence in 
Iraq. The majority of our Shia contacts doubted that the 
apprehension of Al-Sadr would have an impact on Bahraini 
Shia. Former exilee and Al-Wifaq member Nizar Al Qari told 
PolOff on April 7 that Bahraini Shi\'a look for guidance from 
religious leaders like Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Al-Sistani 
and Lebanon\'s Fadlallah.  Al-Sadr is from an entirely 
different school of thought and often in disagreement with 
Al-Sistani.  It is unlikely that either Al-Sistani or 
Fadhlallah would call Shia in the region to revenge Al-Sadr\'s 
death, he said. 
 
2.  (C)  In addition, Al Qari mentioned to PolOff on April 7 
that Shaikh Ali Salman President of the largest Shia 
political society Al Wifaq, traveled to Najav to visit with 
Ayatollah Al-Sistani and to stay with his close friend, IGC 
member and member of the Islamic Da\'wa party Ibrahim 
Al-Ja\'fari.  Upon his return Shaikh Ali Salman informed his 
members that the Shi\'a would not interfere with developments 
in Iraq. 
 
3.  (C)  Some Shi\'a contacts consider Al-Sadr too young to 
deserve a Bahraini reaction.  Youth Forum member Jaafer Hamza 
told PolFSN on April 7 that Al-Sadr is a stupid political 
teenager.  Hamza was not surprised that Al-Sadr ordered 
Al-Khui\'s murder and those who understand Iraq know that 
\"Al-Sadr is digging his own grave.\" Most other Shia contacts, 
however, suspect that the evidence against Al-Sadr in the 
murder of Al-Khui is a USG fabrication in its ploy to occupy 
Iraq beyond June 30. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  It would help our own work trying to keep 
Bahrain\'s Shia majority on board with our policies in Iraq if 
some details of the investigation into Sadr\'s involvement in 
Ayatollah al-Khui\'s death could be released.  Information 
about the arrest warrant and accusations won\'t help us much. 
We could better use background details about how the 
information which led to the arrest warrant was developed.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In order to derail an NGO\'s plan to 
embarrass the GOB during Bahrain\'s April 4 Grand Prix race, 
the Ministry of Interior (MOI) arrested a human rights 
activist on March 30 for alleged un-Islamic behavior and 
indecency.  In the process the GOB denied the activist his 
right to legal counsel.  In its attempt to defame the 
activist, the GOB broke its own laws and released his name 
and particulars of his case to the local press. The 
Government\'s handling of this arrest is a message to Bahraini 
NGOs that the Government can revert to tough behavior 
reminiscent of the 1990s when activists try to embarrass the 
government. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
THE POLICE VERSION 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C) On March 30, Bahraini police detained President of 
the National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture 
(NCMVT) Abdularouf Abdullah Ahmed Al-Shayeb on charges of 
un-Islamic behavior and indecency.  Al-Shayeb prior to his 
arrest had been trying to organize a protest against torture 
in Bahrain on April 4, the day of the Grand Prix race. 
Subsequent to his arrest, the Public Prosecutor ordered him 
held for one week.  According to an RSO source, the employer 
of an Indonesian housemaid had learned from another Bahraini 
that a stranger had been visiting his housemaid daily while 
the employer was at work.  At the employer\'s request, the 
police monitored his home.  On March 30 a man was seen 
entering the maid\'s quarters.  The police raided the quarters 
and discovered the Indonesian housemaid and the man, both 
naked.  The police took the man, later identified as 
Al-Shayeb, into custody.  The housemaid claimed that she was 
having a sexual relationship with Al-Shayeb. 
 
------------------- 
AL SHAYEB\'s VERSION 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Contrary to the police account, Al-Shayeb told Poloff 
that the GOB had assigned two cars to shadow him since his 
return from Geneva where he met with the United Nations 
Committee on Torture on March 28.  On March 30, Al-Shayeb 
made a visit to the Al Fattah Training Institute when two men 
grabbed him as he walked back to his car.  They brought him 
to a nearby house where another man dragged an Indonesian 
housemaid to the front yard.  Al-Shayeb asserted that she had 
been slapped around, and that she identified Al-Shayeb as a 
man with whom she had been sleeping. He was quickly arrested 
and brought directly to CID for interrogation.  At the 
interrogation, a policeman covered Al-Shayeb\'s head.  Then a 
man started insulting him and demanding answers.  Al-Shayeb 
alleged that he immediately recognized the voice of former 
Interior Minister official Adel Flaifel, having been tortured 
by him in the past. Al-Shayeb claims that Flaifel threatened 
to cut out his tongue.  At that moment Al-Shayeb uncovered 
his own head and saw Flaifel, who quickly left the 
interrogation room.  Al-Shayeb insists that he was never in 
the housemaid\'s quarters, never had any type of relationship 
with the woman, and claimed that he would never risk his 
marriage to have an affair with someone so unattractive. 
 
---------------------- 
THE GOB BEHAVES POORLY 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) For the five days Al-Shayeb was held in jail, the GOB 
denied him access to legal representation.  Human rights 
activist Adel Al-Abassi told PolOff on April 3 that Al-Shayeb 
was denied legal counsel because the GOB feared he might be 
able to give the go-ahead to his Committee to stage a protest 
during the Grand Prix race.  Al-Abassi predicted that the GOB 
would release Al-Shayeb on the day of the race, preventing 
Al-Shayeb from organizing an NCMVT demonstration that would 
have embarrassed the GOB. Bahrain Center for Human Rights 
President Nabeel Rajab told PolOff on April 2 that the 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) panicked and had Al-Shayeb 
arrested to guarantee nothing would happen. In an attempt to 
defame Al-Shayeb, the GOB leaked Al-Shayeb\'s name and the 
particulars of the case to the local press.  The 
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Justice, Shaikh Khalid bin 
Ali Al-Khalifa, confirmed to P/E Chief on April 4 that it is 
illegal in alleged vice cases to divulge the name and nature 
of a case until a verdict is handed down.  Shaikh Khalid said 
that the Ministry of Information must have leaked Al-Shayeb\'s 
information to the press, since the Ministry of Justice is 
under strict instructions not to divulge such information. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT.  We find Al-Shayeb a character of dubious 
reliability; even our other human rights contacts admit that 
the story about the Indonesian housemaid has questions on all 
sides.  Moreover, this is the first time we have heard of the 
infamous Adel Flaifel returning to the Ministry of Interior. 
That said, there is less question about how the government 
moved to detain and stop the activist; certainly the police 
acted on a vice tip with far greater than usual enthusiasm. 
The GOB\'s only focus this week was to ensure the success of 
the widely-watched Grand Prix event.  The GOB warned all NGOs 
and the opposition that it would not allow disruptions of any 
kind.  Al-Shayeb was the only activist unwilling to stand 
down.  The GOB appears to have decided it could not risk 
ignoring Al-Shayeb\'s threat to organize a protest in full 
view of the racing audience.  (The NCMTV had embarrassed the 
GOB in the past by declaring National Martyr\'s Day the day 
after Bahrain\'s National Day, staging a televised 
demonstration with over 2500 in attendance - see ref b.)  In 
recent months the GOB has reacted harshly to make sure the 
hard-line opposition here understands the Government will 
react toughly when confronting efforts to embarrass it 
internationally. In so doing, the Government is moving a step 
backwards in the protection of the right of assembly in 
Bahrain.  END COMMENT.

1. SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Through the TIFA and FTA negotiation 
processes, Bahrain has been making great strides to improve 
its business and investment climate, improving regulatory 
standards in banking and finance and establishing new laws to 
protect IPR and enhance transparency.  Nonetheless, Bahrain 
is not yet an ideal destination for business investment: a 
complex business formation procedure, difficulty in obtaining 
work visas for non-Bahrainis, and relative scarcity of land, 
water and natural gas hinder investment.  If Bahrain can 
address these problems, it will benefit from the 
duty-advantages and investment-climate enhancements of our 
bilateral FTA.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
------------------------------ 
BUSINESS REGISTRATION RED TAPE 
------------------------------ 
 
2. The Ministry of Commerce proudly launched electronic 
company registration over a year ago.  And while this part of 
the registration process is transparent, registering a 
company requires industry-specific pre-approvals and in some 
cases, also post-registration approvals from other ministries 
before business can begin.  Unfortunately, acquiring these 
approvals is not always transparent and generally must be 
done in person.  This adds time and substantial inconvenience 
to the registration process and discourages businesses from 
establishing here instead of elsewhere in the Gulf. (See 
Country Commercial Guide for a flow-chart outlining the 
company registration process). 
 
-------------- 
BAHRAINIZATION 
-------------- 
 
3. \"Bahrainization\"--industry-specific quotas on the 
percentage of Bahraini citizens a company employs--is a topic 
that can heat up any discussion among members of the business 
community in Bahrain.  A salon owner bemoans lost business 
and falling profits because she has to pay her Thai 
hairstylists to stay home for a week every month or so while 
she secures new work visas.  A construction equipment sales 
manager complains that he has to fight the Labor Ministry and 
then wait months to get a visa to hire an Egyptian marketing 
director.  The fundamental complaint among businesses is the 
same: when qualified Bahraini workers are unavailable, the 
government nevertheless makes it difficult to hire from 
outside the country.  This policy is designed to reduce 
unemployment among Bahraini nationals (officially 15 percent) 
by putting the onus on companies to hire local staff.  The 
problem is that the quotas are not linked to the availability 
of qualified Bahraini workers in a given industry, and it is 
up to businesses to rectify the mismatch.  To circumvent this 
broken system, many companies hire Bahrainis on the books 
only, because it is worth it to them to pay a few extra 
employees to be able to hire skilled foreigners. 
Bahrainization is a highly charged political issue, pitting 
even socially-minded businessmen against the rolls of 
unemployed, but a fix needs to be found. 
 
------------------------ 
SCARCE NATURAL RESOURCES 
------------------------ 
 
4. Land:   Scarcity of land in Bahrain is a real impediment 
to attracting new industry to the small island nation of 
Bahrain, and hinders expansion of those industries already 
situated here, a Shura council member and businessman told 
ECONOFF April 10.  A Bahrain Financial Harbor board member 
told ECONOFF April 10 that land prices in Bahrain have gone 
so high that it is now actually cheaper to create \"reclaimed\" 
land by dredging, as the Financial Harbor project is doing, 
than to purchase existing parcels.   Bahrain Business 
Incubator Center chairman told ECONOFF March 20 that the 
government of Bahrain is able to help its incubatees rent 
industrially zoned land at reasonable prices in order to 
establish independently, but this bonus can last only as long 
as the Government still has land available.  In addition, 
non-GCC citizens can only purchase land in designated areas 
of the island (see Country Commercial Guide). 
 
5. Power and water: The Government of Bahrain currently 
subsidizes consumer cost of electricity 30 percent and water 
55-60 percent.  Bahrain\'s power and water outputs meet 
current demand, but are insufficient to meet future needs or 
to support anticipated industrial growth (see reftel).  An 
Ernst and Young study commissioned in 2003 indicated that 
Bahrain would be in urgent need of a new power generating 
facility by 2006.  Fresh water is scarce on this desert 
island, and the underground aquifer that currently supplies 
approximately one third of Bahrain\'s water, will not be able 
to produce more, so additional desalinization plants 
(typically coupled with power plants) will be necessary. 
Bahrain will need natural gas, too. Natural gas fueling power 
generating facilities now is a by-product of refining on the 
island.  However, this supply is too limited.  Therefore 
Bahrain has begun negotiations with Qatar over the 
construction of a gas pipeline and a long-term purchasing 
agreement.  ECONOFF learned April 5 that this deal was not 
moving forward as quickly as the Bahrainis had hoped.  Until 
a steady gas supply can be secured, concerns over power and 
water sufficiencies will continue.

Classified By: By Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  On April 9 a GOB official statement expressed 
concern about the violence in Iraq and urged all parties to 
exercise self-restraint.  The statement also said that 
Bahrain hopes to see the reconstruction of Iraq and the 
restoration of stability.  Privately, top GOB officials have 
told the Charge (ref a and b) of their understanding and 
strong support for Coalition forces to contain Muqtada 
Al-Sadr and the Jaysh Al-Mahdi. 
 
2.  (U)  Even though the GOB has publicly measured its words, 
many Bahraini parliamentary and civil society leaders have 
been very vocal about the escalating violence in Iraq.  Press 
coverage of the April 9 Shi\'a Friday sermons called for the 
US occupiers to stop the violence and get out of Iraq now. 
Coverage of the Sunni Friday sermons echoed the need for the 
US to leave and also pointed out that the violence has 
unified Sunni and Shi\'a Iraqis in the face of the American 
enemy. Local Arabic and English columnists compared events in 
Fallujah to the Jenin massacre of Palestine.  Editorialist 
Abdulla Al-Ayoobi asserted that the US has learned the 
Zionist lessons of crime and cruelty to the people of the 
region.  What is happening in Iraq today is a duplicate image 
of what happens in Palestine everyday, he added.  Sunni 
political society Al Minbar Islamiiya issued a press 
statement condemning what they consider \"criminal incidents\" 
that the American forces have committed against the Iraqis. 
 
 
3.  (C)  Our private conversations with our Shi\'a contacts 
are no more supportive.  Condemning the recent violence in 
Fallujah and Najaf, some Embassy contacts label it as \"US 
generated.\"  A reliable source told PolOff on April 10 that 
main Shi\'a opposition leader Al-Wifaq President Shaikh Ali 
Salman does not agree with Al-Sadr\'s tactics, but credits 
Al-Sadr for successfully uniting Iraq\'s Shi\'a and the Sunni 
against the United States.  This makes the situation far more 
dangerous for the Americans, Salman told our source.  Salman 
pointed out that in Fallujah Iraqi Shi\'a are now giving blood 
for the wounded Sunnis.  Bahrain Women\'s Society President 
Wajeeha Al Baharna told PolOff on April 10 that Al-Sadr\'s 
taking of international hostages \"crosses the line into 
terrorism.\"  She warned that since the US is unsuccessful in 
combating terrorism, that America needs to get out now or be 
responsible for the total loss of the country.  With the 
resignation of Iraqi Governing Council members, Council of 
Representatives Mohammed Shaikh Al-Abass told PolOff on April 
10 that the Americans should leave Iraq now or stay and pick 
one Iraqi leader.  Shura Council member Mohammed Hassan Radhi 
offered PolOff his solution on April 11: the Grand Ayatollah 
Ali Al-Sistani is the only leader that can quell the violence 
and be able to back Muqtada Al-Sadr into a corner. 
 
4.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  Last week Post reported that the capture 
of Muqtada Al-Sadr was unlikely to impact Bahraini Shi\'a. 
This week Bahraini Shi\'a have started to voice their 
unhappiness with the US after watching the week-long coverage 
of the escalating violence in Iraq and its use of \'massive 
firepower\' (to quote a parliamentarian) to hunt Al-Sadr.  It 
is unclear whether continued US military actions in Iraq will 
unify Bahraini Shi\'a and Sunni against the US. Though there 
has not been much change of opinion among our Sunni contacts, 
two separate contacts told PolOff (on two individual 
occasions) that if they had to pick between the US and 
Muqtada Al-Sadr, they would pick Al-Sadr.  END COMMENT.

SECURITY, LATER ON DEMOCRACY 
 
 
Classified By: Robert S. Ford, reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The King, Crown Prince and Foreign 
Minister told visiting American officials on April 13 that 
the U.S. needs to focus more of its effort on restoring 
stability in Iraq immediately, and to worry less about 
building democracy there in any short time frame.  The King 
and Foreign Minister suggested Arab states should help with 
security issues in consultation with the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Bahrain\'s King, Crown Prince and Foreign Minister 
told visiting U.S. officials that the U.S. needs to 
concentrate its attention now on restoring stability in Iraq, 
and worry less about building democracy there.  King Hamed 
told CJCS General Myers on April 13 that the U.S. can\'t leave 
Iraq until stability and order are securely reestablished. 
He dismissed the Iraqi Governing Council as unable to make 
tough decisions.  Iraq needs to be a republic, but Arab 
republics historically are weak, he said.  Therefore, the 
U.S. Government needs to find a strong leader able to steer 
the republic and guide the security services.  It is vital, 
the King asserted, that a strong leader rebuild the Iraqi 
Government\'s authority and credibility among the Iraqi 
public.  The King stated that it didn\'t matter if that strong 
man was a Sunni, a Shia or a Kurd; even Salahadin was a Kurd, 
he exclaimed. 
 
3.  (C)  Crown Prince Salman was characteristically blunt to 
CJCS Myers at the April 13 lunch also attended by the King. 
Salman asked when the U.S. would shift its focus from 
building democracy in Iraq - a nearly impossible task in the 
short term - and instead concentrate on building security. 
He wondered if it was possible for the U.S. political 
establishment to understand that the democracy goal in Iraq 
was not achievable this year. 
 
4.  (C)  Speaking to Congressman Issa on April 13, Foreign 
Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Mubarak wondered where the U.S. 
could find an Iraqi \"Adenauer\" who could to address Iraq\'s 
many problems.  Sheikh Mohammed added that restoring law and 
order has to take precedence over issues like a constitution 
or democracy.  The U.S. also had to keep aggressive neighbors 
like Iran out of Iraqi affairs, the Foreign Minister added. 
 
5.  (C)  The King and Foreign Minister both said on April 13 
that regional states should take a greater role in Iraq.  The 
King said it is unfortunate U.S. troops are patrolling 
cities.  This is a job better left to Iraqi security or even 
Arab forces while American units secure the borders.  The 
Arab League should be brought into play.  Speaking 
separately, the Foreign Minister said that the U.S. should 
secure an agreement in principle from the Arab League so that 
\"select\" Arab states could send forces to help the Coalition. 
 (Sheikh Mohammed specifically cited the UAE, Jordan and 
Bahrain.)  The Foreign Minister said that last year the U.S. 
rejected such an idea.  He suggested the time has come to 
revisit that decision. 
 
6.  (C)  King Hamed also urged that the U.S. try harder with 
Sunni tribes in western Iraq.  He recalled that historically 
tribal leaders could be paid to guarantee security across 
large expanses of territory.  He recommended the U.S. focus 
more intently on building ties to tribal leaders; the 
Jordanians could help a great deal in this, he added.  Hamed 
also cautioned against letting religious figures, especially 
among the Shia clerical establishment, get too involved in 
Iraqi political affairs. 
 
7.  (C)  Hamed expressed confidence the U.S. ultimately would 
prevail; he was not especially alarmed by the recent spike in 
fighting.  He was more interested on April 13 in giving 
advice about how to make the Iraq campaign easier. 
Nonetheless, all three officials underlined the primacy of 
restoring stability in Iraq, while dismissing the chances of 
democracy, more clearly than we have ever heard them do 
before.

interrupted Charge several times asking if the USG was sure 
of its information on Zindani.  He reminded the Charge that 
the USG had used unreliable Israeli intelligence sources in

on Zindani was accurate. Charge specifically requested that 
the GOB prevent Zindani\'s entry into Bahrain in order to 
hinder his fundraising capabilities for terrorist activities. 
 The Minister said he would prevent Zindani\'s entry into 
Bahrain but highly doubted that Zindani would be traveling

Classified By: Charge de Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Congressman Ryan called the Arab League\'s boycott of 
Israel a \"Free Trade Agreement (FTA) showstopper\" in his 
April 7 meetings with parliamentarians, the Minister of 
Finance and National Economy and the Minister of State of 
Foreign Affairs. Although Ryan praised Bahrain for being the 
leader of democratic reform in the region, he expressed his 
hope that Bahrain would likewise take a leadership role in 
countering the boycott of Israel. 
 
2.  (C) As a follow-up to Ryan\'s presentation, Charge 
provided Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Abdelghaffar 
with documentation that demonstrated an increase in boycott 
compliance requests from 15 in 2002 to 31 this year on April 
12 (reftel). Charge also discussed reftel\'s tertiary boycott 
contract text examples with Minister Abdelghaffar. Bahrain 
repealed both secondary and tertiary aspects of the boycott

boycott compliance requests were still an issue. Charge urged 
Abdelghaffar to resolve this serious issue to ensure smooth

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI LEADERS ON IRAQ:  FOCUS FIRST ON 
SECURITY, LATER ON DEMOCRACY 
 
Classified By: Robert S. Ford, reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The King, Crown Prince and Foreign 
Minister told visiting American officials on April 13 that 
the U.S. needs to focus more of its effort on restoring 
stability in Iraq immediately, and to worry less about 
building democracy there in any short time frame.  The King 
and Foreign Minister suggested Arab states should help with 
security issues in consultation with the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Bahrain\'s King, Crown Prince and Foreign Minister 
told visiting U.S. officials that the U.S. needs to 
concentrate its attention now on restoring stability in Iraq, 
and worry less about building democracy there.  King Hamed 
told CJCS General Myers on April 13 that the U.S. can\'t leave 
Iraq until stability and order are securely reestablished. 
He dismissed the Iraqi Governing Council as unable to make 
tough decisions.  Iraq needs to be a republic, but Arab 
republics historically are weak, he said.  Therefore, the 
U.S. Government needs to find a strong leader able to steer 
the republic and guide the security services.  It is vital, 
the King asserted, that a strong leader rebuild the Iraqi 
Government\'s authority and credibility among the Iraqi 
public.  The King stated that it didn\'t matter if that strong 
man was a Sunni, a Shia or a Kurd; even Salahadin was a Kurd, 
he exclaimed. 
 
3.  (C)  Crown Prince Salman was characteristically blunt to 
CJCS Myers at the April 13 lunch also attended by the King. 
Salman asked when the U.S. would shift its focus from 
building democracy in Iraq - a nearly impossible task in the 
short term - and instead concentrate on building security. 
He wondered if it was possible for the U.S. political 
establishment to understand that the democracy goal in Iraq 
was not achievable this year. 
 
4.  (C)  Speaking to Congressman Issa on April 13, Foreign 
Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Mubarak wondered where the U.S. 
could find an Iraqi \"Adenauer\" who could to address Iraq\'s 
many problems.  Sheikh Mohammed added that restoring law and 
order has to take precedence over issues like a constitution 
or democracy.  The U.S. also had to keep aggressive neighbors 
like Iran out of Iraqi affairs, the Foreign Minister added. 
 
5.  (C)  The King and Foreign Minister both said on April 13 
that regional states should take a greater role in Iraq.  The 
King said it is unfortunate U.S. troops are patrolling 
cities.  This is a job better left to Iraqi security or even 
Arab forces while American units secure the borders.  The 
Arab League should be brought into play.  Speaking 
separately, the Foreign Minister said that the U.S. should 
secure an agreement in principle from the Arab League so that 
\"select\" Arab states could send forces to help the Coalition. 
 (Sheikh Mohammed specifically cited the UAE, Jordan and 
Bahrain.)  The Foreign Minister said that last year the U.S. 
rejected such an idea.  He suggested the time has come to 
revisit that decision. 
 
6.  (C)  King Hamed also urged that the U.S. try harder with 
Sunni tribes in western Iraq.  He recalled that historically 
tribal leaders could be paid to guarantee security across 
large expanses of territory.  He recommended the U.S. focus 
more intently on building ties to tribal leaders; the 
Jordanians could help a great deal in this, he added.  Hamed 
also cautioned against letting religious figures, especially 
among the Shia clerical establishment, get too involved in 
Iraqi political affairs. 
 
7.  (C)  Hamed expressed confidence the U.S. ultimately would 
prevail; he was not especially alarmed by the recent spike in 
fighting.  He was more interested on April 13 in giving 
advice about how to make the Iraq campaign easier. 
Nonetheless, all three officials underlined the primacy of 
restoring stability in Iraq, while dismissing the chances of 
democracy, more clearly than we have ever heard them do 
before.

Classified By: By Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  On April 9 a GOB official statement expressed 
concern about the violence in Iraq and urged all parties to 
exercise self-restraint.  The statement also said that 
Bahrain hopes to see the reconstruction of Iraq and the 
restoration of stability.  Privately, top GOB officials have 
told the Charge (ref a and b) of their understanding and 
strong support for Coalition forces to contain Muqtada 
Al-Sadr and the Jaysh Al-Mahdi. 
 
2.  (U)  Even though the GOB has publicly measured its words, 
many Bahraini parliamentary and civil society leaders have 
been very vocal about the escalating violence in Iraq.  Press 
coverage of the April 9 Shi\'a Friday sermons called for the 
US occupiers to stop the violence and get out of Iraq now. 
Coverage of the Sunni Friday sermons echoed the need for the 
US to leave and also pointed out that the violence has 
unified Sunni and Shi\'a Iraqis in the face of the American 
enemy. Local Arabic and English columnists compared events in 
Fallujah to the Jenin massacre of Palestine.  Editorialist 
Abdulla Al-Ayoobi asserted that the US has learned the 
Zionist lessons of crime and cruelty to the people of the 
region.  What is happening in Iraq today is a duplicate image 
of what happens in Palestine everyday, he added.  Sunni 
political society Al Minbar Islamiiya issued a press 
statement condemning what they consider \"criminal incidents\" 
that the American forces have committed against the Iraqis. 
 
 
3.  (C)  Our private conversations with our Shi\'a contacts 
are no more supportive.  Condemning the recent violence in 
Fallujah and Najaf, some Embassy contacts label it as \"US 
generated.\"  A reliable source told PolOff on April 10 that 
main Shi\'a opposition leader Al-Wifaq President Shaikh Ali 
Salman does not agree with Al-Sadr\'s tactics, but credits 
Al-Sadr for successfully uniting Iraq\'s Shi\'a and the Sunni 
against the United States.  This makes the situation far more 
dangerous for the Americans, Salman told our source.  Salman 
pointed out that in Fallujah Iraqi Shi\'a are now giving blood 
for the wounded Sunnis.  Bahrain Women\'s Society President 
Wajeeha Al Baharna told PolOff on April 10 that Al-Sadr\'s 
taking of international hostages \"crosses the line into 
terrorism.\"  She warned that since the US is unsuccessful in 
combating terrorism, that America needs to get out now or be 
responsible for the total loss of the country.  With the 
resignation of Iraqi Governing Council members, Council of 
Representatives Mohammed Shaikh Al-Abass told PolOff on April 
10 that the Americans should leave Iraq now or stay and pick 
one Iraqi leader.  Shura Council member Mohammed Hassan Radhi 
offered PolOff his solution on April 11: the Grand Ayatollah 
Ali Al-Sistani is the only leader that can quell the violence 
and be able to back Muqtada Al-Sadr into a corner. 
 
4.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  Last week Post reported that the capture 
of Muqtada Al-Sadr was unlikely to impact Bahraini Shi\'a. 
This week Bahraini Shi\'a have started to voice their 
unhappiness with the US after watching the week-long coverage 
of the escalating violence in Iraq and its use of \'massive 
firepower\' (to quote a parliamentarian) to hunt Al-Sadr.  It 
is unclear whether continued US military actions in Iraq will 
unify Bahraini Shi\'a and Sunni against the US. Though there 
has not been much change of opinion among our Sunni contacts, 
two separate contacts told PolOff (on two individual 
occasions) that if they had to pick between the US and 
Muqtada Al-Sadr, they would pick Al-Sadr.  END COMMENT.

SUMMIT AGENDA 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert Ford, reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin 
Mubarak told us on April 13 that the next Arab League summit 
would issue a statement supporting domestic reforms inside 
Arab states.  The Minister said that during the last Arab 
League ministerial in Cairo Egypt, Jordan and Yemen had each 
presented a draft text about domestic reforms in Arab 
countries.  The ministers asked the three countries to work 
off-line and come up with a single text.  Sheikh Mohammed 
said that basically this is finished. 
 
2.  (C)  According to the Minister, the statement will not 
hold up any country as a model.  Instead, it will highlight 
principles underpinning a vision of the future of Arab 
societies.  The Minister said democracy and elections, human 
rights, women\'s rights and transparency figure among the 
principles. 
 
3.  (C)  The Foreign Minister also said that the next summit 
would roll out again the Middle East peace initiative that 
was launched at the Beirut summit.  (He noted that one of the 
reasons for delaying the summit this time was that the Sheikh 
Yassin killing was going to overshadow the summit\'s roll out 
of its peace initiative.)  In addition, a Saudi Arabian 
document is the basis for reforms to the Arab League itself. 
 
4.  (C)  Neither the King nor the Foreign Minister in their 
conversations with us April 13 would hazard a guess about 
when the summit would be held exactly.  The Foreign Minister 
joked that he hoped it would be soon as it already has been 
enough of a headache for Bahrain.

TO BAHRAIN 
 
REF: MANAMA 528 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires, reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Mr. Armitage:  We are delighted you are coming to 
Bahrain, and the Bahraini Government is as well.  King Hamad 
has met Generals Abizaid and Myers during the past two weeks, 
but as political issues move to the fore in Iraq the King had 
hoped a senior State Department official would come here. 
Your visit is, therefore, well timed. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
2.  (C)  Hamad and his officials are worried about security 
and stability in the post June 30 Iraq.  Above all, they do 
not want a revolutionary Shia state in Iraq.  They understand 
that Coalition forces will remain in Iraq, but they are not 
convinced we have a viable strategy for forming an Iraqi 
government to whom we can turn over sovereignty.  They will 
ask you about this.  The King and Crown Prince both think we 
need an ex-military strongman.  They discount the utility of 
promoting democracy or drafting a good constitution during 
the next couple of years.  Bahraini public opinion, 
meanwhile, has been considerably more critical of U.S. 
military operations in Iraq due to grim television images 
from Fallujah.  The elected house of the Bahraini Parliament 
issued a statement April 13 denouncing what it called 
\"horrible massacres at the hands of U.S. military forces.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
REFORMS and U.S. MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  On foreign policy and domestic issues, the elected 
house of Parliament is growing steadily more assertive. 
Parliamentarians are scrutinizing the budget and 
investigating allegations of government corruption.  Several 
ministers may lose their jobs because the elected house will 
vote for motions of no-confidence or force a cabinet 
reshuffle.  There is a strong, conservative Islamist block in 
the Parliament often antagonistic toward the U.S. (they 
pushed the Iraq resolution, for example).  The Parliament is 
likely to block ratification of our signed Article 98 
agreement, and the government has therefore put the Article 
98 on hold. 
. 
4.  (C)  We are using the Middle East Partnership Initiative 
to promote reforms in government, including the Parliament. 
NDI\'s two-year old program is very popular with the 
parliamentarians, including the Islamists.  MEPI is also 
financing American Bar Association experts working with the 
Justice Minister on judicial reform.  We have launched 
programs on civic education, curriculum reform and 
U.S./Bahraini university linkages with the Ministry of 
Education.  The technocrats in Bahrain have some maneuver 
room for reforms; the Embassy, however, is almost at its 
limit in terms of staff resources to manage new MEPI 
programs. 
 
5.  (C)  Public reaction to our initiative to help reforms 
across the region met with some knee-jerk anti-American 
responses.  More educated persons recognize that the reforms 
are good for Arab societies and reformers should access help 
where they can find it.  The King told Undersecretary 
Grossman last month that he strongly backed our effort, but 
that we should understand some countries, like Saudi Arabia, 
would move relatively slowly. The Foreign Minister told us 
April 13 that the next Arab League summit would issue a 
statement outlining specific reform principles, such as 
democracy, transparency and respect of human rights, which 
should guide the future development of Arab society. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  You have raised with the Bahrainis before our 
concerns about Sunni extremists who move around freely in 
Bahrain.  Bahraini surveillance is not particularly good. 
There is disagreement within the GoB about whether existing 
Bahraini laws suffice to detain these people or charge them 
with conspiracy to commit criminal acts.  The GoB is drafting 
a new anti-terrorism law, and with DS/ATA funding we will 
have U.S. Justice Department officials review the draft with 
the Bahrainis.  There is also a question of political will 
within the GoB, and we suggest you reinforce our demarches 
that the Government must do more to contain the Sunni threat, 
including putting large vehicle scanners on the bridge 
linking Bahrain with Saudi Arabia. 
---------------------- 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The GoB made little concrete progress on TIP in CY 
2003 and remains at Tier II.  Embassy officers and visiting 
Congressional officials have warned this could impede 
Congressional approval of the free trade agreement expected 
to reach congress next autumn.  In particular, the Bahrainis 
need to be tougher on enforcement; they need to punish known 
traffickers taking advantage of South Asians coming here to 
work.  They also need to devote some resources to establish a 
useful hotline and building a refuge shelter for victims. 
Your briefly mentioning these points with the Prime Minister, 
who oversees the Cabinet, would reinforce our own frequent 
discussions with the Government.

GUANTANAMO DETAINEES 
 
REF: STATE 85231 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford, reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Bahraini MFA Minister of State Abdelghaffar told 
Charge April 18 that Bahrain does not think the Cuban 
resolution about Guantanamo detainees is helpful, and it 
asked Cuba to withdraw the resolution.  Abdelghaffar said it 
was obvious the Cubans are trying to score political points 
with the resolution.  Bahrain has no special bilateral 
relationship with Cuba and the resolution would not help 
Bahrain, he stated flatly. 
 
2.  (C)  Comment:  The Minister of State had just finished 
justifying Bahrain\'s vote against the American-backed 
resolution condemning Cuban human rights violations.  The 
Minister said his government had decided in that instance to 
maintain ranks with other Arab governments which all were 
voting against the anti-Cuban resolution.  When Charge then 
raised the Cuban resolution on Guantanamo, the Minister of 
State\'s categoric assertion surprised us.  The fate of six 
Bahrainis in Guantanamo is a big domestic political issue; it 
is often front-page news here.  A variety of domestic human 
rights groups as well as members of the Parliament regularly 
criticize the MFA for not helping the six Bahrainis.  The MFA 
is, predictably, quite sensitive about the criticism. 
 
3.  (C)  Comment continued:  The logic of Bahraini political 
decision-making suggests that (a) if the Cuban resolution 
gains international attention such that the MFA\'s vote is 
subject to political scrutiny in Bahrain or (b) if there is a 
push among the Arab states to back the Cuban resolution, then 
the MFA likely would vote for the Cuban resolution, despite 
the Minister\'s remark to us April 18.  This is why the MFA 
would prefer the Cubans withdraw the resolution.

SUBJECT:  MEPI\'S \"MY ARABIC LIBRARY\" GETS A GREEN LIGHT 
IN BAHRAIN 
 
REF:  MANAMA 000399 
 
1.   (U) During a third meeting about MEPI\'s \"My Arabic 
Library\" with senior Ministry of Education officials in 
Bahrain (February 22, March 16, and April 17), the 
Ministry of Education approved Bahrain\'s participation in 
this project. The approval comes after post\'s efforts to 
overcome Ministry concern and in some instances complete 
rejection of the program by some Ministry staff (see 
reftel). 
 
2. (U) On April 17, PAO, APAO, Scholastic Inc. Vice 
President Dr. Carol Sakoian and her regionally based 
colleagues Michelle Alwan and Bassem Badran met with the 
Minister of Education to present Ministry officials with 
a list of titles and 12 sample translations.  The 
Minister welcomed the visit and approved MEPI\'s \"My 
Arabic Library.\" He cited the goal of promoting reading 
among Bahraini youth and the contribution that the \"My 
Arabic Library\" can make to this objective.  \"We need to 
encourage our children to read and they need interesting 
books, so I welcome this program. Anything that gets 
children to put down their Playstation controls is a good 
thing,\" he stated. He acknowledged the strong cooperative 
relationship that exists between the Ministry and the 
Embassy and affirmed that the \"My Arabic Library\" 
initiative would further strengthen that relationship. 
 
3. (U) The Ministry will pursue implementation of the 
program with caution.  Ministry officials made clear 
their desire to inspect each translated book in detail to 
ensure cultural sensitivity of the wording, concepts, and 
pictures.  The Scholastic delegation expressed concern to 
Emboffs that this will delay getting the books into the 
classroom. However, Ministry officials have insisted that 
they will examine all the proofs in spite of the delays 
that may be caused. The Scholastic delegation agreed to 
send the remaining 28 translated proofs to the Ministry 
of Education, as they become available, for approval. 
(Comment: While visiting public schools, APAO and 
Scholastic delegation noticed pictures of boys and girls 
wearing shorts on classroom walls and in children\'s 
books. APAO noted, and Scholastic VP concurred, that such 
pictures would not be allowed in the translated books. 
The Ministry will be exponentially more cautious with the 
content of the Scholastic books than the content of their 
own books and classrooms.) 
 
4. (U) The Minister arranged meetings for the Scholastic 
delegation with other Ministry officials to discuss 
details and implementation of the program.  The Assistant 
Undersecretary for Curricula and Training, Director of 
Curricula, and Director of Primary Schools saw proofs of 
12 translated books.  Their initial reactions were 
positive.  They expressed pleasure with the layout, 
pictures, and topics of the books.  They also discussed 
plans for training teachers on using the new Arabic 
library. A tentative training date was scheduled for mid- 
October.

BURNS 
 
REF: MANAMA (KING CABLE) 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford for reasons 1.4(b)(d). 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1.(C) A feistier than usual Foreign Minister Shaikh Muhammad 
bin Mubarak Al Khalifa stressed on April 20 to NEA A/S Burns 
that the U.S. refashion consensus on the peace process.  He 
very pointedly stated that the U.S. needs to package its 
initiatives better to glean greater Arab support for them. 
Embarrassing key Arab leaders like Mubarak and Saudi Crown 
Prince Abdullah can have implications beyond the peace 
process, like on Iraq policy.  Shaikh Muhammad seemed 
optimistic that the Arab League Summit might be able to 
revive the Arab peace plan and issue a statement on regional 
reform.  The Bahrainis would publicly endorse reform, he 
assured.  On FTA-related bilateral issues, an uncomfortable 
Shaikh Muhammad pledged action on the Article 98 agreement 
\"soon,\" assured A/S Burns of Bahrain\'s commitment to fight 
trafficking in persons, and promised to investigate a recent 
spike in Arab League Boycott clauses in GOB and parastatal 
contracts. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
U.S. NEEDS IMPROVED PEACE PROCESS PACKAGING 
 
2.(C) A feistier than normal Foreign Minister emphasized to 
NEA A/S Burns that the U.S. needs to refashion consensus on 
the peace process in the wake of the President\'s announcement 
that he supports Prime Minister Sharon\'s Gaza withdrawal 
initiative.  Shaikh Muhammad welcomed the news that the 
Secretary would meet in early May with the Quartet to reach 
 
SIPDIS 
consensus on incorporating the Gaza withdrawal into the 
roadmap and to start preparations on programming to help the 
Palestinian Authority take control of Gaza.  He also was 
pleased by A/S Burns\'s assurance that we will need the U.N. 
and the World Bank to provide large scale assistance to the 
PA starting the day after it takes over authority in Gaza. 
The U.S. must rebuild the PA\'s capacity to govern and its 
ability to be a credible partner for peace.  Bahrain, he 
stated emphatically, cannot make peace with Israel until the 
Palestinians do so. 
 
3.(C) The Foreign Minister stressed that the U.S. needs to 
improve its packaging of the peace process.  The President\'s 
endorsement of an Israeli plan at a time when the Israelis 
are assassinating Palestinian leaders only inflames Arabs 
against the U.S.  Embarrassing Mubarak and surprising Crown 
Prince Abdullah doesn\'t build sympathy for the U.S. either. 
This has major implications for Arab support for the U.S. in 
Iraq and other issues, he underscored. 
 
ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT LOOKAHEAD 
 
4.(C) Shaikh Muhammad assured A/S Burns that Arab leaders are 
trying to resuscitate the Arab peace proposal for the Tunis 
Summit.  However, he expected that the Shaikh Yassin and 
Rantissi killings will make it hard to gain consensus. 
Everyone, he noted, remembers the last time an Arab Summit 
presented a peace plan; Sharon attacked Jenin. 
 
5.(C) Responding to A/S Burns\'s hope that the G-8 could issue 
a statement of support for Middle East reform echoing an Arab 
League statement, Shaikh Muhammad said that Bahrain agrees 
with the philosophy of a new Middle East.  He affirmed that 
Bahrain would make a statement at the summit in support of 
reform.  However, the Foreign Minister cautioned that the 
pace of reform will differ from country to country.  He urged 
patience with Saudi Arabia.  It\'s society is very different 
from the rest of the region, and the KSA is facing serious 
threats from internal terrorism. 
 
BILATERAL ISSUES - ARTICLE 98, TIP, AND ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT 
 
6.(C) Keying off Shaikh Muhammad\'s request that we conclude 
and bring into force the FTA by the end of this year, A/S 
Burns noted three outstanding bilateral issues that could 
have implications on congressional FTA approval -- the 
Article 98 Agreement, Trafficking in Persons, and the Arab 
League Boycott.  A/S Burns asked Shaikh Muhammad how quickly 
we could move forward on ratification of Article 98.  Clearly 
uncomfortable, Shaikh Muhammad responded \"soon.\"  On 
trafficking in persons, A/S Burns emphasized that Congress is 
now demanding statistics on enforcement of anti-trafficking 
legislation, and he urged the Minister to provide as much 
information as possible about concrete actions like 
prosecutions and convictions of traffickers to the Embassy. 
Shaikh Muhammad responded that Bahrain is fully engaged on 
this issue, had just issued a brochure on worker rights to 
migrant workers in the Kingdom and was following up on other 
key actions.  Surprised by the news about the increase in 
boycott requests from Bahraini entities, Shaikh Muhammad 
noted that Bahrain had changed its laws on the boycott years 
ago and promised to investigate the matter immediately. 
 
COMMENT 
 
7.(C) The Foreign Minister and the GOB want to help with the 
peace process and with the regional reform.  Most Bahraini 
leaders believe that more freedom and increased economic 
activity within the region will produce more stability and 
security.  However, Bahrain can\'t do much more than lead 
reform by example.  Shaikh Muhammad was clear that it will 
not be a leader on the peace process; hence his encouragement 
to re-establish consensus among the major Arab leaders on the 
peace process and to increase U.N. and European activity.

SUBJECT: DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE\'S APRIL 19-20 MEETINGS 
WITH THE KING AND CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN 
 
 
Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CDA ROBERT S. FORD FOR REASONS 1.4 (B AND 
D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: In separate meetings with Deputy Secretary 
Armitage, King Hamad and Crown Prince Sheikh Salman pledged 
their government\'s full commitment to its strategic alliance 
with the US. The King and Crown Prince stressed the need to 
immediately restore order in Iraq with the selection of a 
strong, Iraqi nationalist leader. However, the Crown Prince 
stressed that stability in Iraq and the region was contingent 
upon the US sponsoring an \"even-handed\" resolution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) King Hamad argued that the US\'s primary goal in Iraq 
should be stability and the creation of a secular, modern 
Iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors.  To do so, the 
King maintained that the US should shift its focus in Iraq 
from fostering democratic processes to finding a strong 
leader who would ensure security and order in the country. He 
maintained that the US needed to do this spade work rather 
than wait for a leader to emerge. King Hamad suggested that 
we identify someone from the former Iraqi military, with a 
substantially clean record, to lead a new government. He felt 
that the USG should give less weight to confessional or 
tribal ties, and instead focus on a strong leader.  King 
Hamad suggested Shia ex-Iraqi army general Nama El-Faris as a 
potential candidate. 
 
3. (S) The Deputy Secretary requested that Bahrain look for 
ways to publicly support US efforts to stabilize the Sunni 
Triangle and Southern Iraq. The Crown Prince agreed that they 
could urge all Iraqis to work together with the CPA to 
rebuild Iraq. He stated that, in addition to installing a 
nationalist Iraqi leader, the US needed to commit itself to 
national reconciliation. National reconciliation could only 
be achieved by trying the worst offenders of Saddam Hussein\'s 
regime and declaring a national amnesty for lower-ranking 
Baathis and unthreatening regime collaborators. Sheikh Salman 
asserted that these steps would \"co-opt\" people into the new 
order. He used America\'s occupation of post-war Japan as an 
example. 
 
4. (S) Although King Hamad did not comment on the Middle East 
Peace Process, Sheikh Salman warned that US efforts in Iraq 
and its war on terrorism would fail if we if we did not 
exercise consistent foreign policy goals across the region. 
Rhetorically, he asked, how can the US advocate freedom, 
democratic institutions and stability in Iraq when, to the 
majority of Arabs, the US does not consistently exhort these 
goals when addressing the Israeli/Palestinian conflict? He 
stated that it is essential to stop Israeli settlements now. 
Salman commented that Arab leaders know that any new 
agreement will not be able to conform to the 1967 boundaries. 
 Yet, he said, nothing the US does will count until its 
efforts are on a par with former President Bush\'s efforts. 
A/S Burns noted that the Israeli idea of moving out of Gaza 
is part and parcel of the road map. He added that the World 
Bank and the international community would have to start 
rebuilding Gaza the day after Israeli withdrawal. Sheikh 
Salman guaranteed the Deputy Secretary and A/S Burns that 
resolution of the Israeli settlement and Palestinian boundary 
issues was an essential factor in winning the war on 
terrorism and that Islamic militant groups would  atrophy as 
a result. 
 
5. (S) Moreover, Sheikh Salman commented that he had told 
Israel\'s Foreign Minister, Silvan Shalom, that Arab states 
and Israel are natural partners against regional threats such 
a Iran. However, the Crown Prince reported that he told 
Shalom that Bahrain could never work with Israel to counter 
common threats as long as the Israeli/Palestinian conflict 
continued. 
 
6. (S) With regard to more local regional issues, King Hamad 
castigated Qatar\'s emir and Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim for their 
independent approach to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
issues. King Hamad asked the Deputy Secretary to encourage US 
efforts to maintain GCC unity. He stated that it was Hamad 
bin Jassim who took action and ensured that Qatar was 
consistently out of step with its neighbors, although the 
Emir was the \"idea man.\" Both the King and the Crown Prince 
proffered a withering analysis of, what they felt, was 
Al-Jazeera\'s tendentious editorial point of view. (They noted 
that both Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya news services are not 
allowed to operate in Bahrain.) The King and Crown Prince 
asserted that Qatar views Saudi Arabia as the real threat to 
its sovereignty, not Iran. The Qataris depend on the US 
presence to protect them from the Saudis. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: The Deputy Secretary and his party were 
warmly received by King Hamad and Sheikh Salman. The King and 
Crown Prince strongly identified with US regional interests 
and stressed that any US success was also their success. It 
was in this context that the King and Crown Prince offered 
their advice to help the US achieve its goals in the region. 
 
8. (U) Deputy Secretary Armitage has cleared this message.

QUESTIONING OF MINISTERS 
 
REF: A. MANAMA 200 
 
     B. MANAMA 138 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Our key FTA negotiator, Minister of Finance 
and National Economy Abdulla Saif, appears likely to survive 
a parliamentary effort to unseat him.  The GOB failed in its 
last minute attempts to cancel the parliamentary questioning 
of Finance Minister Abdulla Saif, but managed to rescue 
Minister of State Abd al-Nabi al-Shoala from questioning in 
relation to the pension funds scandal (refs a and b).  Many 
parliamentarians believe that Saif has allegedly bought off 
enough MPs to prevent his removal from office.  The 
investigation and questioning has raised the parliament\'s 
credibility with the public and may induce a cabinet 
reshuffle.  The rumors of MP vote-buying are troubling as is 
the emergence of Sunni extremist Shaikh Adel al-Moawda as the 
parliament\'s most influential member.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PRIME MINISTER REQUESTS TO BLOCK THE QUESTIONING 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  (C) On April 10, the Prime Minister sent a letter to the 
Council of Representatives(COR) requesting that the COR honor 
its promise not to question the ministers if the government 
implemented the recommendations of the ad-hoc committee,s 
report.  In his letter, the Prime Minister promised that 
\"loans\" from the Pension Fund Commission (PFC) and the 
General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) would be 
paid immediately with interest.  The next day the Arabic 
newspaper &Akhbar Al Khaleej8 published that the GOB will 
give BD8.6 million (USD22.8 million) to the PCF and BD7.6 
million (USD20.2 million) to GOSI. The GOB also amended the 
1975 and 1976 social security laws issued by Decree number 
(24), restructuring the administration of both GOSI and the 
PFC, and appointing a consultative company to prepare an 
actuary study on the possibility of merging both funds. 
(COMMENT: The constitution requires passage by the National 
Assembly of all laws; perhaps the newspaper, which often gets 
things wrong, meant that the amendments will be sent to the 
legislature for approval.  END COMMENT) 
 
------------------------------------ 
OTHERS JOIN FIGHT TO BAR QUESTIONING 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C)  On April 19 the Minister of Shura and Representative 
Council Affairs Abdul Aziz Al-Fadhel followed up the Prime 
Minister\'s lead by contesting the legality of the 
parliamentary motion to question the three ministers in a 
letter to the COR Chairman.  Al-Fadhel argued that the 
questioning includes accountability for actions taken by the 
ministers before the existence of the COR, and therefore the 
actions cannot be challenged according to Article (45) of 
Decree for law number (15) for the year 2002.  Al-Fadhel also 
referenced Article (146) of the Council,s bylaws that 
prohibits MPs to ask questions on topics previously discussed 
during the investigation.  The Parliament conceded these 
constitutional points related to Minister of State and former 
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Abd al-Nabi al-Shoala, 
so they canceled his questioning. 
 
4.  (U)  The Government\'s communications emboldened COR 
Speaker Khalifa Al-Dhaharani to join the effort to block the 
questioning.  In a full session of the COR, al-Dhaharani 
introduced two motions to stop the process.  Contrary to 
expectations in local press reports that the government\'s 
last minute effort would divide the Parliamentary alliance, 
COR blocs and independent MPs expressed solidarity, easily 
defeating Al-Dhaharani,s motions.  After the votes, MP Hamad 
Al-Muhannadi (a Salafi member of the Al Asala Islamic 
Society) insisted that replenishing the retirement funds\' 
money was insufficient; the people responsible needed to be 
punished. 
 
------------------------- 
SAIF APPEARS SAFE FOR NOW 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  The COR\'s Services Committee questioned Saif for five 
hours on April 20 and 21. MPs differed on their assessment of 
the Minister,s responses in the two-day session, casting a 
shadow on whether the COR would proceed to a vote of 
no-confidence.  MP Abdulhardi Marhoon in private with us 
charged on April 28 that Minister Saif \"bought-off\" several 
MPs.  According to MP Marhoon, on April 20, Minister Saif met 
separately with Shaikh Mohammed Khalid, Dr. Ibrahim 
Al-Abdulla, Ahmed Bezhad, Abdulla Al-Alali and several 
others.  Once proponents of unseating Saif, these MPs became 
virtually silent during the proceedings. On April 21 MP 
Mohammed Khalild said in the Bahrain Tribune that the 
minister surprised members with his poise and grace and 
produced all the documents that would stand as strong 
evidence in his favor.  However, other MPs strongly 
disagreed.  Deputy Abdul Nabi Salman asserted to POLFSN that 
Minister Saif evaded some questions and flatly refused to 
answer others.  Fareed Ghazi told POLFSN that reports and 
rumors of Saif\'s wonderful performance during the questioning 
are propaganda to deter a vote of no-confidence.  Many MPs 
expressed their doubts to PolFSN on April 28 that there will 
be enough votes now to remove Minister Saif.  MP Shaikh 
Mohammed Khalid told PolFSN on April 28 that he believes 
MOFNE will be divided into a Ministry of Finance and a 
Ministry of Planning and Economy.  He strongly believes that 
Minister Saif will be shifted to the Ministry of Planning and 
Economy. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Daunted by constitutional disincentives to legislate, 
the COR has aggressively pursued its oversight authority. 
The COR\'s investigation of allegations of GOB corruption and 
mismanagement and its questioning of ministers has improved 
the legislatures credibility with many Bahrainis, and it 
possibly may produce a cabinet reshuffle.  The timing of the 
questioning also forced Minister Saif to cancel his visit to 
the recent IMF/World Bank meetings in the United States. 
Saif\'s apparent survival of this strong attempt to remove him 
from office leaves him weakened domestically but still able 
to act as Bahrain\'s lead negotiator for the Free Trade 
Agreement (even if he loses the Finance Ministry portfolio). 
On the other hand, the rumors of MP vote-buying are troubling 
for the near term health of Bahrain\'s democracy. 
 
7. (C) This scandal has highlighted the COR\'s new movers and 
shakers as well as spotlighted the end of others.  Some argue 
that Chairman Khalifa Al-Dhaharani,s blatant pro-government 
tendencies have weakened him.  The debate has further exposed 
First Deputy Chairman al-Marhoon\'s leadership shortcomings. 
As a result of their troubles, Salafi Second-Deputy Chairman 
Shaikh Adel al-Moawda now appears to be the strongest leader 
in the elected house. (NOTE: Al-Moawda, described by many as 
a &radical Islamist,8 heads the Council,s Salafi Al Asala 
Bloc. END NOTE)

SUBJECT:  BAHRAINI MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQI POW TREATMENT 
 
 
1.  Summary:  For the past three days, all five Bahraini 
daily newspapers have run front-page stories with banner 
headlines, photos of Iraqi POWs being mistreated, and 
columns about the mistreatment of Iraqi POWs.  Writers and 
opinion leaders have questioned U.S. values of democracy and 
human rights.  Bahrainis are also comparing Arab satellite 
coverage of the issue with coverage on CNN and BBC World. 
One managing editor told the PAO that Arabs no longer trust 
CNN or BBC to report accurately on what is happening in the 
region - they only trust the Arab satellite channels.  Many 
Bahrainis believe that the mistreatment of Iraqi POWs is 
much more widespread than what has been reported in the U.S. 
media.  They believe that prisoners in Guantanamo and 
Afghanistan have also been subjected to torture.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  EDITORIAL COMMENT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
SEMI-INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AKHBAR AL-KHALIJ,\" 5/3, 
COLUMNIST ABDULLA AL-AYOOBI (Bahraini columnist who is a 
moderate advocate of reforms, even from the U.S.): 
 
\"I believed only one thing that Bush said when he commented 
on the pictures of tortured Iraqis.  I believed him when he 
said that these actions did not represent the American 
people.  Apart from that comment, everything else he said 
about the photos was a lie.  We know that the American 
people would never accept such practices.  That is why the 
American people were against the war in Vietnam and are now 
against the war in Iraq.\" 
 
INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AL WASAT,\" 5/3, COLUMNIST WALEED 
NOUEIHED (Managing editor of Al Wasat, a moderate 
intellectual, used to work for Al Hayat in London.): 
 
\"The pictures of tortured and degraded Iraqi prisoners 
should not be surprising or shocking because this war 
started with a lie.  Why wouldn\'t Americans lie about the 
values of their soldiers?  The disgusting pictures are a 
direct message to Arabs who have been fascinated with the 
Western model and the American way of life.  All American 
values are fake.  If these mercenaries, who came all the way 
from the U.S. just to fulfill their racism against Muslims 
and Arabs, do this at Abu Ghraib prison, why would they not 
commit similar crimes against mosques and holy shrines and 
then accuse Islamist groups for carrying out these 
activities?\" 
 
INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AL WASAT,\" 5/3, JOURNALIST TAMAM 
ABU SAFI (A moderate, twenty-something journalist, usually 
pro-Western.): 
 
\"I was not as disgusted by the photographs of Iraqi POWs as 
much as I was disgusted by the reaction of President Bush on 
this issue.  Didn\'t he expect these actions from soldiers 
who joined the army because they failed in their studies.? 
The question is what will pro-American Iraqis say about the 
U.S. occupation in Iraq now?  Will they still say that U.S. 
actions are the democratic tools for a free Iraq?\" 
 
SEMI-INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AKHBAR AL-KHALIJ\" 5/3, 
BY COLUMNIST SAMEERA RAJAB (anti-American Bahraini 
columnist): 
 
\"Torturing Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison is a war 
crime and sets a very dangerous precedent.  These pictures 
in the media -- and many more posted on the internet, 
including Iraqi women prisoners being raped by British and 
American soldiers -- confirm the atrocities that happen 
everyday, not only in Iraq but also in Guantanamo.  The 
American scandals and crimes have begun to be revealed . the 
legend of American democracy and human rights are mere 
illusions.\" 
 
SEMI-INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AKHBAR AL-KHALIJ\" 5/4, 
COLUMNIST SAYED ZAHRA (anti-American Egyptian columnist): 
 
\"Everybody in the world, including American and British 
leaders, expressed their shock about the photographs of 
torture, as if they did not know of the atrocious crimes 
their soldiers have been committing in Iraq.  If the world 
wants to know who the real criminals are, they will find 
them in the White House and at 10 Downing Street.  They are 
not the seven or eight soldiers who tortured the prisoners. 
They are the leaders of America and Britain.  If the 
international community has a conscience and keenness to 
protect human rights, all crimes against Iraqis must be 
independently investigated.\"

ABU-GHRAIB PRISON 
 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Embassy contacts expressed their anger and disgust 
about the media reports on the treatment of Iraqi POWs at Abu 
Ghraib Prison. After seeing these images on Al-Jazeira 
television, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights 
Nabeel Rajab told PolOff on May 3 that the USG expects Arabs 
to cooperate when it is clear that the US has no respect for 
Arabs. Human Rights Activist Adel Al-Abassi told PolOff on 
May 3 that reports out of Iraq in addition to USG\'s support 
of Israel over Palestine is typical US behavior.  Bahrain 
Women\'s Society member Soroor Qarooni told PolOff on May 3 
that American soldiers and their generals need to be removed 
from the region and severely punished.  \"No human being 
deserves this type of humiliation,\" she said. 
 
2.  (C)  Youth Forum member Jaafer Hamza told PolOff on April 
30 that he could not put into words the shame and pity he 
felt, after seeing photos in the local newspaper.  Another 
member Sami Maliky called PolOff on May 2 to vent his anger 
over a picture forwarded to him showing a smiling American 
soldier having two Iraqi youths display a sign that read, 
\"Lance Corporal Boudreaux killed my Dad, then he knocked up 
my sister.\" \"You can\'t blame of us for thinking that all 
Americans, even stupid soldiers, must hate Arabs,\" Maliky 
said.  Law student Dua\' Al Masae\'d told PolOff on May 3 that 
it was disgusting to see the \"enjoying smiles\" of the 
American soldiers, who sexually posed the naked prisoners. 
 
3.  (U)  The press reported on May 1 that pre-eminent Shi\'a 
religious cleric Issa Qassim, during his Friday sermon, 
addressed the issue of Iraq and the policy of the American 
occupation. He said that Americans are materialistic and have 
lost all credibility since they came to loot Iraq and enslave 
its people.  Qassim then warned the Americans of the gravity 
of entering Iraq\'s holy cities saying that the cities\' 
shrines are not only for Iraqis, but for all Muslims. 
 
4.  (U)  Writers and opinion leaders have questioned U.S. 
democratic and human rights values.  Bahrainis are also 
comparing Arab satellite coverage of the POW issue with 
coverage on CNN and BBC World.  One managing editor told the 
PAO that Arabs no longer trust CNN or BBC to report 
accurately on what is happening in the region - they only 
trust the Arab satellite channels.  Many Bahrainis believe 
that the mistreatment of Iraqi POWs is much more widespread 
than has been reported in the U.S. media.  They believe 
prisoners in Guantanamo and Afghanistan have also been 
subjected to torture. 
 
5.  (C)  On the other hand, one of the most anti-American 
newspaper editors told Charge on May 3 that the one positive 
from this affair is that the US Army started the 
investigation.  If the investigation is serious, the US will 
regain a fraction of its lost credibility. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT.  Most of the Embassy contacts who provided 
their opinions on the Iraqi POWs during the course of 
discussing regular Embassy business. Although the Bahrain 
population appears angry regarding the treatment of Iraqi 
POWs, we do not expect that its reaction will translate into 
any type of organized protest or specific threat nor does it 
appear to affect their relationships with Embassy personnel.

SUBJECT: GOB ARRESTS 14 YOUTHS GATHERING SIGNATURES FOR A 
PETITION 
 
REF: MANAMA 237 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Ford for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Once again, the GOB appears to have 
responded to hardline opposition political pressure with its 
usual heavy-handed measures.  In charging the 14 youths with 
\"crimes against the internal security of the state,\" the GOB 
has drawn a legal line in the sand on opposition behavior. 
The GOB is arguing that the petition, which requests 
amendments to the constitution to increase democratic 
representation in the legislature, is illegal because the 
2002 constitution specifies that amendments must go through 
Parliament and the King.  The 2002 constitution states that 
the King may propose constitutional amendments to the 
National Assembly.  If past practice prevails, the GOB will 
soon release the youths after they pay a fine.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  On April 30 police arrested 14 youths for 
distributing pamphlets and collecting signatures for the 
opposition\'s petition to the King calling for constitutional 
reform.  Public Prosecutor Shaikh Abdul Rahman bin Jaber 
Al-Khalifa ordered the youths\' detention for 45-days because 
\"the evidence against the accused was overwhelming.\"  He 
charged the teenagers under Articles 160, 165, 166, and 169 
of the 1976 Penal Code, all of which pertain to \"crimes 
against the internal security of the state.\"  Article 166 
carries a sentence of life imprisonment.  Human Rights 
Activist and Al-Wifaq member Adel Al-Abassi told PolOff on 
May 3 that the police initially denied the teenagers access 
to lawyers.  President of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights 
(BCHR) Nabeel Rajab told PolOff on May 3 that BCHR formed a 
committee to appeal for the release of the detainees.  The 
families staged a peaceful vigil at the jail on May 3.  BCHR 
member Janan Al-Shaikh told PolOff on May 4 that the families 
plan to hold another peaceful vigil at the Prosecutor\'s 
Office on May 5.  Youth Forum and Al-Wifaq member Sami Maliky 
told PolOff on May 4 that the police have detained Al-Wifaq 
member Mohammed Yousif for soliciting signatures at work. 
 
 
------------------------ 
CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (U) \"Al Ayam\" reported on May 4 that the GOB claimed the 
opposition societies acted illegally on several counts. The 
Public Prosecutor charged that the opposition parties acted 
illegally by not limiting signatures to society members and 
that the opposition societies may have used coercive wording 
in pamphlets soliciting signatures.  Both Muharraq Family 
Society member Yousif Bu Zaboon and President of Al Tajamo 
Democratic Society Abdulla Hashim received phone threats 
after refusing to allow signature gatherers use their 
property to promote the signing of the petition.  Akbar 
Al-Khaleej reported on May 3 that many elderly and illiterate 
citizens were taken without their knowledge or permission to 
some of the centers to sign without knowing the actual 
content of the petition.  The Minister of the Royal Court 
Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa claimed in a Gulf News 
article that the opposition\'s campaign to collect signatures 
on a petition seeking constitutional change is \"illegal\" 
because only the King and the National Assembly can call for 
constitutional change. 
 
----------------- 
BREAKING THE LAW? 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C)  In answer to the GOB\'s claims that the opposition 
societies acted illegally, Adel Al-Abassi explained to PolOff 
on May 4 that the petition campaign was called \"Sign to 
Sign.\"  If a person wanted to sign the petition, s/he had to 
sign a membership application before signing the petition. 
Al-Abassi explained that coercive language was not used in 
the pamphlets.  The English translation of the text was 
incorrect.  \"If you do not sign you will pay for it in your 
child\'s blood\" is an Arabic proverb for \"If you do not act 
now to change the situation, your future generations will 
suffer.\"  Nizar Al Qari reported on May 4 that Abdulla Hashim 
told him that the phone threats were not related to refusing 
to open his Majlis to the petitioners.  BCHR leader Abdulhadi 
al-Khawaja told PolFSN on May 3 that the 2002 Constitution 
guarantees the right to petition. 
 
------------------------------ 
PUNISHMENT BEFITTING THE CRIME 
------------------------------ 
5.  (C).  The Minister of Industry and royal democracy 
advisor Hassan Fakhro told Charge on May 4 that the GOB 
believes that the opposition parties acted illegally and is 
tired of being deceived by them.  Fakhro asserted that the 
opposition is notorious for claiming to organize peaceful 
marches that turn violent and to schedule seminars on topics 
different than actually presented.  The GOB is taking this 
opportunity to make examples of the youths to reestablish law 
and order.  The Charge told Minister Fakhro that he 
understood the need to enforce Bahraini law.  However, Charge 
cautioned that a life imprisonment sentence for petitioning 
the GOB would tarnish Bahrain\'s reputation.  The Minister of 
Industry doubted that the GOB would impose such severe 
sentences. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  The opposition parties continue to provoke 
the government over the constitution. The King, who has 
repeatedly expressed his willingness to entertain 
constitutional changes that go through constitutional 
channels, appears to have lost patience with the opposition\'s 
pressure.  The GOB has responded in a heavy-handed fashion 
that is likely to hurt Bahrain\'s image. It may also have 
opened itself to court challenges regarding the legality and 
constitutionality of these arrests.  We will see if the 
defense attorneys exploit the opportunity.  As for the young 
men, Post expects that the teenagers will not face anything 
more serious than 45 days in jail and fines, if the 
government follows past practices.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  BAHRAINI MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQI POW TREATMENT 
 
1.  Summary:  All six Bahraini daily newspapers continue to 
run stories about U.S. mistreatment of Iraqi POWs.  In 
addition to photos of prisoners, newspapers are running 
photos of families waiting outside Iraqi prisons to obtain 
information about their loved ones inside.  Letters to the 
editor pages are also full of letters from ordinary 
Bahrainis and other Arab and South Asian expats living and 
working in Bahrain.  These letters include the same themes 
as regular columnists: shock, sadness, and calls on the U.S. 
military to punish, and not just reprimand, the 
perpetrators.  Bahrainis continue to watch Arab satellite 
coverage of the issue and many fears that the abuse is 
widespread and that the worse is not yet known.  They 
believe that prisoners in Guantanamo and Afghanistan are 
also being subjected to torture.  Papers are full of 
political cartoons poking fun at American values of freedom 
and human rights in light of the prisoner abuse.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  EDITORIAL COMMENT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
ENGLISH DAILY \"BAHRAIN TRIBUNE\" EDITORIAL, 5/5: 
 
\"Moral Decadence of Coalition Soldiers\" 
 
\"The vulgar and systematic torture of Iraqi prisoners by 
coalition troops in Abu Ghraib prison has shown the moral 
decadence and bankruptcy of some of the American and British 
soldiers.  It seems there was an understanding between the 
US and UK troops as to how badly the captured should be 
mistreated.  That most of the coalition troops are mentally 
sick became doubtless when a group of twenty Indians who ran 
away from a US military camp in Iraq told their story in the 
Hindustan Times.  One of them said they were taken to an 
American army camp in Mosul where they were told that they 
had been `bought\' to work in the kitchen. \"We were slaves in 
the American kitchens.\"  These stories have made it amply 
clear that the US-UK forces are much more inhuman than 
previously thought.  They abide by no engagement rules and 
would make animals blush with their torture tactics. 
 
..Torture is a tool of the weak.  It will never help bring 
peace in Iraq.  The blood-boiling pictures will make more 
people inside and outside Iraq determined to carry out 
attacks against the Americans and British.  Those 
responsible - no matter how influential and senior they are 
- must be punished for war crimes and given exemplary 
punishment.  Otherwise there is no reason for us not to 
believe that the illegal detainees in Afghanistan and in 
Guantanamo Bay are also subject to the same affront.\" 
 
SEMI-INDEPENDENT ARABIC DAILY \"AKHBAR AL-KHALIJ\" 5/4, 
BY COLUMNIST RADHI SAMAK (moderate Bahraini columnist, 
returned International Visitor): 
 
\"The Dimensions of the Torture Scandal\" 
 
\"It would have been surprising if there were no human rights 
violations or torture incidents against Iraqi prisoners, 
because the history of America since the end of World War II 
shows that its forces tortured and degraded the citizens of 
any country it occupied.  The American and Britain 
administrations are trying to depict the incidents as if 
they were the acts of a few individuals, but the reality is 
that any occupation on earth lacks ethics and moral values.\"

\"The Scandals of American Liberty and Happy Democracy\" (part

\"As much as the pictures of tortured Iraqis were horrible, 
the reactions of the American and British leaders were 
pitiful if we take in consideration that they were 
responsible for everything that has happened in Iraq so far. 
CBS network has only revealed the tip of the iceberg of the 
many facts that have been hidden.  This incident shows the 
true ugly face of the American slogans of democracy and 
human rights.  That is why verbal condemnation is not 
enough.  Arab governments and the international community 
must form an international investigation commission to 
disclose the crimes of occupation forces in Iraq.\"

COLUMNIST Fawziya Rasheed (Bahraini columnist):

\"Unlike the image that America promoted about the goals of 
the war in Iraq, facts show us clearly that everything is 
crumbling down on America after the crimes that its 
mercenary soldiers committed there were revealed.  All that 
we have seen so far about the crimes and torture Americans 
committed against Iraqis is actually a small amount of the 
barbaric crimes that lie beneath.  American and British 
officials must be punished for these crimes because all of 
them happened with their knowledge and blessing.  Arab 
lawyers and legal experts must act together to take these 
crimes and those who were responsible for them to an 
international tribunal not only to question these crimes but 
also the war and its hidden objectives.\"

1. (U) This cable contains company-proprietary information. 
Please protect accordingly.  Not for intrnet distribution. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU/NF) We offer in this cable insights into four major 
remaining FTA issues: insurance, government procurement, car 
tariffs and textiles. 
Industry indicates that the draft insurance law is 
inadequate.  This protected insurance sector is likely the 
slowest financial service to open to market forces. 
The Royal Court, Prime Minister\'s Court and Crown Prince\'s 
Court are the most sensitive entities the U.S. has requested 
for Government Procurement chapter coverage.  However, giving 
in to Bahrain on these points could set an unwelcome 
precedent for future FTA negotiations in the GCC. 
On automobiles, contrary to GOB assertions, car dealers do 
not expect that zero tariffs on U.S. automobiles would affect 
market volume growth rate.  Rather, consumers are more likely 
to shift their preferences to larger or more prestigious 
U.S.-made cars as they become more affordable. 
Post-FTA textile industry expectations have spun out of 
control.  These must be reined in. The failure for 
unreasonable expectations to materialize will tarnish 
regionally the FTA\'s reputation for economic effectiveness 
and could hinder negotiation of subsequent FTAs in the GCC. 
END SUMMARY 
 
--------- 
INSURANCE 
--------- 
 
3. (U) MOFNE officials Yousif Humood and Selma Waheedi 
pointed out to EconOff April 28 that a policy-level decision 
was needed regarding Bahrain\'s request for a 2-year grace 
period to liberalize insurance.  Bahrain\'s Financial Services 
lead negotiator Abdulrahman Saif clarified for EconOff May 4 
that this grace period is requested for direct non-life 
insurance only.  Bahrain needs this time, Saif said, to 
transition from an established industry that was closed since 
its inception to an open sector.  Bahrain Monetary Agency 
Insurance Supervision Director Tawfiq Shehab explained to 
EconOff May 4 that single-class insurers must be registered 
offshore, while onshore licenses stipulate either life or 
non-life.  (NOTE: Shehab said that there are currently 9 or 
10 local insurers, plus 9 branches onshore, while there are 
80 offshore companies. END NOTE).  Onshore non-life insurers 
are currently required to offer all classes of non-life 
insurance, including compensatory auto insurance at 
government pre-set rates, Shehab continued.  Bahrain is in 
the process of formulating a new insurance law as part of the 
transition of the industry from the Ministry of Commerce to 
the Bahrain Monetary Agency, Saif added. 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers London has already prepared three 
consultative papers to address the regulatory regime, which 
is scheduled to begin implementation in 2005.  However, Saif 
said, the underlying reason for Bahrain\'s request for a two 
year transition phase is that the BMA needs to train 
regulators and establish procedures to enforce the new law. 
 
4. (SBU) However, ALICO has alerted post to another 
insurance-related concern.  ALICO-AIG Bahrain Group Managing 
Director Ghaleb Hammoudi shared with PolEconOff April 28 
e-mail correspondence from ALICO Gulf COO Fadi Chammas to 
Bahrain Monetary Agency Executive Director of Financial 
Institutions Supervision Anwar Al Sadah, in which Chammas 
expressed his disappointment with Bahrain\'s draft insurance 
law.  Hammoudi elaborated to EconOff May 4 that the draft law 
does not allow for commission-based sales agents, but 
requires instead a European-style employer-employee 
relationship.  ALICO-AIG would be forced to change their 
sales system to one they consider less effective and less 
motivating.  The change, he said, would also open the company 
up to employee litigation and subject the company to 
Bahrainization quotas.  Hammoudi anticipated that, as a 
result of the new law, ALICO would experience losses, not 
growth, and would likely shut its doors to its current 12,000 
client families in Bahrain after two to three years. 
Hammoudi described the proposed legal framework as \"a 
protectionist, sentimental, spoon-feeding employment policy,\" 
adding that Chammas had characterized the draft law as \"even 
worse than the existing law.\"  In his e-mail, Chammas wrote 
that as a result, Insurance and Reinsurance companies are 
racing to establish operations in Dubai. 
 
---------------------- 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
---------------------- 
 
5. (U) Two outstanding government procurement issues are GCC 
preferences and coverage.  Ministry of Finance and National 
Economy (MOFNE) Director of Economic Affairs Yousif Humood 
and MOFNE Senior Economist Selma Waheedi assured EconOff 
April 28 that GCC preference in government procurement is a 
non-issue.  This preference ends at the beginning of 2005 per 
WTO to meet national treatment requirements.  Furthermore, at 
the upcoming mid-May GCC summit Bahrain intends to raise the 
prospect of ending preferences before the end of the year. 
 
6. (U) On coverage, MOFNE\'s Humood and Waheedi stressed to 
EconOff April 28 that Bahrain would have great difficulty in 
accepting the additional government entities the United 
States has requested for inclusion.  Unsurprisingly, they 
cited the Amiri (Royal) court, the Prime Minister\'s Court, 
and the Crown Prince\'s Court as political non-starters.  The 
officials included the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA), 
Bahrain\'s central bank, among the most problematic because of 
the agency\'s \"need for autonomy,\" they said. 
 
------------------- 
MARKET ACCESS: CARS 
------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The Government of Bahrain\'s stock answer for not 
including automobiles--five percent of U.S.exports to Bahrain 
in 2003--in its duty-free market access offer is that the 
resultant five percent reduction in cost to consumers would 
cause a run on cars, yielding increased traffic congestion 
and pollution problems.  However, car buyers in Bahrain are a 
price sensitive population, Director of Zayani Motors Nawaf 
Zayani, whose family\'s company represents Chrysler, 
Mitsubishi, BMW, Range Rover and MG in Bahrain, told Econoff 
May 3.  At the same time, cars are a high-prestige item, and 
families will spend up to fifty percent of their monthly 
income on a car, he added.   Almoayed Motors (Ford, Lincoln, 
Mercury) General Manager Sunil George told EconOff May 3 that 
he would not expect the total market size to change as a 
result of reduced tariffs on U.S. automobiles; rather he 
expects a shift to more expensive models or from Japanese or 
European makes to U.S. cars. Jeff Thomas, National Motor 
Company General Manager (Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC, Honda) 
noted May 3 to EconFSN that as a result of the soft dollar, 
NMC had seen a noticeable shift from Honda purchases to their 
more competitively priced American brands. Mannai Motors 
owner Talal Mannai (Saab, Opel) also told EconFSN that U.S. 
vehicles already have a built-in price advantage over cars 
valued in Euros. 
 
8. (SBU) Car dealers in Bahrain appreciate the difference 
between an American brand car and a car made in America. 
Almoayed Motors General Manager Sunil George told EconOff May 
3 that more than fifty percent of their fleet--Ford, Lincoln 
and Mercury--are produced in Europe.  Small \"American\" cars, 
which represent Almoayed\'s high-volume sales in Bahrain, tend 
to be produced in Europe (Ford) and small GM cars for the 
region are produced in Korea. Only Almoayed\'s large, luxury 
vehicles, such as the Lincoln Towncar or Crown Victoria, are 
produced in America, George added.  Conversely, Nawaf Zayani 
noted that certain \"non-American\" makes stood to benefit from 
a reduction in tariffs on U.S. cars.  For example, popular 
models such as Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and the BMW X-5, 
are made in America.

TEXTILES: MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

9. (U) As if reading from the same script, representatives 
from the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Labor, the 
National Assembly and the business community repeat to anyone 
who will listen the message that the FTA is the panacea that 
will rescue and reinvigorate Bahrain\'s textile/garment 
industry.  The rapidly spreading urban legend maintains that 
FTA\'s zero tariffs and TPLs will not only compensate for 
Bahrain\'s higher costs of production--including highest labor 
costs in the region--to make Bahrain\'s products highly 
competitive in the post-quota marketplace, but will even 
cause the sector to grow and generate new jobs.  Members of 
the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry Textiles 
Committee (Garment Section) expect that companies that closed 
because they were uncompetitive would be revived and would 
thrive in a post-FTA world.  That Bahrain\'s garment 
manufacturers tend to use third-country cloth that would not 
meet yarn-forward tests does not enter into the equation. 
Instead, there is an unfounded expectation that FTA will make 
a powerhouse out of Bahrain\'s garment industry and in so 
doing will magically free Bahrain of its unemployment-related 
social ills.  Emboffs have heard these same fables repeated 
to congressional staffers, FTA negotiators, and in private 
meetings. 
 
10. (U) EconOff often discussed with MOFNE officials the need 
for public outreach to explain what FTA can and cannot do and 
to rein in unreasonable expectations.  May 3, MOFNE Director 
of Economic Relations Yousif Humood addressed the Bahrain 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  EconFSN, who attended the 
open session, reported that even after this forum, the public 
still harbors many misconceptions and questions about FTA.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (SBU/NF) On insurance, U.S. companies\' perspectives and 
their interests in the region indicate that we need to push 
harder for an agency model in Bahrain\'s insurance law as well 
as quicker transition to openining the sector. 
Post firmly believes that backing down on our Government 
Procurement entities list is inadvisable because the optics 
are atrocious and would ultimately have implications for 
future Gulf FTAs. Based on our survey, anectotal evidence at 
the microeconomic level does not support the GOB Market 
Access stance on cars.  We recommend sustaining our position. 
Textile hysteria needs to be calmed, both to conclude the 
chapter and to give FTA implementation a reasonable chance 
for public perception of economic success.  END COMMENT.

1.(C) SUMMARY: The government will release the 14 detainees 
arrested for gathering petition signatures if the opposition 
agrees to drop its illegal petition drive.  According to 
Bahraini law, a corporate entity may only submit to 
government a petition signed by the entity\'s members.  The 
government arrested the petitioners because of allegations 
they were coercing citizens to sign the petition.  The 
detainees are maintaining their hunger strike and small 
demonstrations are being held on their behalf.  One detainee 
was taken to hospital.  The government and the hardline 
opposition are engaged in a dialogue through many 
intermediaries.  They appear to be close to a political 
agreement that could win the detainees\' release and mark the 
hard line opposition\'s formal acceptance of the 2002 
constitution as the law of the land.  That could mark the 
beginning of full participation in Bahrain\'s democratic 
reform experiment, increasing significantly its prospects for 
success.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(C) The government arrested petition gatherers because they 
were coercing people who refused to sign the petition with 
threats of shunning, Foreign Ministry Assistant 
Undersecretary for Cooperation and Follow up Shaikh Abd 
al-Aziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa told POL/ECON Chief on May 9. 
Shura Council member and human rights activist Faisal Fuladh 
verified to POL/ECON Chief and POLOFF on May 10 that citizens 
had complained to him and other National Assembly members 
about intimidation, and several press reports on coercion 
have been published.  (COMMENT:  The opposition societies 
used similar coercion tactics to enforce their boycott of the 
October 2002.  END COMMENT) 
 
3.(C) Royal advisor Hassan Fakhro and Shaikh Abd al-Aziz told 
us separately that Bahraini law forbids general petition 
drives; a society may only submit to government a petition 
signed by the society\'s members.  Fakhro said the government 
arrested the signature gatherers specifically because they 
violated this law.  Minister of Industry and royal confidante 
Hassan Fakhro told Charge on May 11 that the Attorney General 
would drop the charges and release the 15 Bahrainis now in 
custody if the four hardline opposition political societies 
agreed in writing to drop their illegal petition drive and 
submit their constitutional amendment requests to the 
parliament. 
 
4.(C) Fakhro told Charge that numerous intermediaries, 
including members of parliament and prominent journalists, 
were facilitating a dialogue between the hardline societies 
and the government.  Face-to-face meetings have also occured. 
 According to Fakhro, the King received pre-eminent Shia 
religious scholars Shaikh Isa Qasim and Sayyid Abdulla 
al-Ghurayfi to help \"clear the air.\"  Fakhro added that the 
King has also offered a meeting with the leaders of the four 
societies if they will drop the petition drive.  Fakhro said 
that al-Wifaq\'s leaders are unwilling to sign an agreement to 
drop the petition drive to obtain the release of the 
detainees, all of whom are al-Wifaq members. 
 
5.(C) Our local NDI rep advised on May 11 that although he 
did not insert himself into the process, both the government 
and the opposition had approached him for advice and to act 
as an informal intermediary.  He said that opposition leaders 
had refused the initial government demand to sign before the 
Attorney General a letter stating that they would \"abide by 
the law of the land.\"  Our contact said that the Minister of 
the Royal Court accepted the NDI rep\'s compromise proposal 
that opposition leaders and prominent political figures in 
society who have been trying to defuse the crisis would sign 
such a letter before the King.  The NDI rep noted that this 
would put the leaders of the hard line opposition societies 
on record as accepting the constitution as the \"law of the 
land.\" 
 
6.(C) According to its president, the Bahrain Centre for 
Human Rights (BCHR) has been facilitating small family member 
demonstrations at the Justice Ministry and other public 
locations (police station, Seef Mall).  He verified that an 
attempt to demonstrate in front of the Prime Minister\'s 
office was prevented by police and the demonstration 
organizer arrested.  Hassan Fakhro told Charge on May 11 that 
the organizer was released from jail on May 10.  The BCHR 
president confirmed that the arrested petitioners remain, as 
of May 11, on a hunger strike.  One was taken to hospital on 
May 9 after he collapsed. 
 
7.(C) COMMENT:  As with February\'s constitutional seminar 
imbroglio, the government is not handling this situation 
deftly.  Shura Council member Faisal Fuladh belittled the 
government approach, arguing it should have just let the 
societies gather signatures and submit their petition.  The 
government could file it \"appropriately\" afterward, he noted. 
 To us, government signals to the hardline opposition are 
inconsistent.  The King accepted last fall a 35,000 signature 
petition collected by the National Committee for the Victims 
of Torture.  Most of the singatories were not members of the 
society.  The government has arrested violent demonstrators, 
but released them with no charge or trial.  They arrested 
petition gatherers and charged them with sedition.  The mixed 
signals have confused the opposition; al-Wifaq Human Rights 
Committee Chairman Adel Abbassi disclaimed to POLOFF \"we 
don\'t know how to dance with the government anymore.\" 
 
8.(C) Despite the confusion, which could very well be 
attributed to Bahrain\'s inexperience with democracy, the 
government and opposition appear close to reaching a 
compromise that would win the detainees\' release.  That 
compromise may also include the opposition\'s formal 
acceptance of the 2002 constitution as the law of the land. 
Such a political agreement could prove to be the beginning of 
full participation in Bahrain\'s democratic reform experiment, 
increasing its probability of success.  END COMMENT.

1.  Bahrain GLOBE high school students continue to 
enthusiastically work together with Americans to save the 
Earth.  To observe Earth Day 2004, PAS coordinated with 
the Ministry of Education and GLOBE Bahrain students to 
support activities to increase awareness of environmental 
issues in Bahrain. On April 21, APAO and PAS FSN joined 
250 GLOBE Students from 26 schools, both public and 
private, to survey the garbage and pollutants in various 
seashore locations in Bahrain. 
 
2.  On April 22, GLOBE students participated in a 
\"Contrail Count-a-Thon\" experiment conducted by NASA and 
GLOBE. Students observed and measured clouds formed from 
water vapor in aircraft exhaust.  Their measurements were 
reported to NASA scientists as part of a worldwide 
experiment. GLOBE students then participated in a web 
discussion group with American GLOBE scientists to 
exchange ideas about how GLOBE measurements can help 
protect the Earth and the impact of these measurements on 
the greater scientific community.  GLOBE students from 
Lebanon, Jordan and Qatar also participated. DCM spoke to

organized GLOBE Environmental Awareness Conference on 
April 27.  PAS distributed Earth Day 2004 posters to the 
26 schools in Bahrain that participate in the GLOBE 
Program. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  The GLOBE Program works.  At a time when 
American credibility faces stark challenges, GLOBE 
students demonstrate the positive impact of educational 
exchange programming.  The science projects and 
international experiments that GLOBE students participate 
offer a common ground for Bahrainis and Americans to 
stand on.  Electronic discussion groups of Bahraini 
students and Americans are just one example of how a 
productive dialogue, albeit not political, continues in 
spite of current tensions. Students are excited about 
having their research recognized in the U.S.  One female 
Globe student told the APAO, \"Knowing that our data is 
important internationally, in places like NASA, makes us 
work harder as a GLOBE Bahrain team.\"  END COMMENT.

 1.  (U)  Mission officers distributed program concept papers 
to some of our better contacts in Government and civil 
society and later followed up to gauge reactions.  MFA 
Assistant Under Secretary Sheikh Abdelaziz bin Mubarak told 
Charge May 12 that he had studied the papers and he found the 
ideas reasonable.  Bahrain already is working in several of 
the fields proposed, such as elections, transparency and 
education reform.  If the Middle East initiative provided 
additional avenues for Bahrain to access particular kinds of 
assistance, then the GoB would welcome that.  He also opined 
that the ideas presented should not generate much controversy 
among Arab states committed to reforms.  None of the programs 
listed looked immediately problematic, he concluded. 
 
2.  (U)  A senior Education Ministry official told us earlier

literacy rate here in about 97 percent.  However, project

3.  (C)  Comment:  Our democracy-related NGO contacts have

this results from their being seized with the ongoing

launched by the hard-line opposition (ref b).  On the evening 
of May 11, however, one of our contacts cautioned us that 
reduced American credibility due to regional events will make

1.   (U) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. The Abu Gharieb prison 
scandal has spurred stories of Bahraini GTMO detainees being 
tortured.  An open letter to President Bush that specified a 
Bahraini citizen by name has gained credibility with some 
government and NGO leaders. Sunni Islamist parliamentarians 
raised the reports of torture with the Minister of State.  To 
the Embassy\'s knowledge the prisoner has made no formal 
complaints of abuse. ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests immediate

GTMO detainee. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) On May 15 English daily \"Bahrain Tribune\" featured 
allegations by two former British-Pakistani GTMO detainees 
that US prison guards at Guantanamo Bay beat an ailing 
Bahraini detainee.  In the same article vocal anti-American 
Parliament member Shaikh Mohammed Khalid condemned the 
torture and called for national mobilization to release all 
six Bahraini detainees.  Arabic daily \"Al Ayam\" also reported 
the allegation which was derived from an open letter to 
President Bush.  The letter named Juma Al-Dossari as the 
victim. 
 
3.  (U)  On May 16 Arabic daily, \"Akhbar Al Khaleej,\" 
published an op-ed piece by Muslim Brotherhood Friday prayer 
leader Shaikh Salah Fuad Ubaid.  Ubaid posited that the US 
Army abused Arab prisoners at GTMO because President Bush 
waged war against Arabs and the Muslim world. On the same 
day, independent newspaper \"Al Wasat\" reported that Bahrain 
Human Rights Society Deputy Secretary General Salman Kamal 
Al-Din questioned the credibility of the torture.  He noted 
that a GOB security delegation recently visited Guantanamo 
and confirmed that the detainees were in good physical and 
mental condition. 
 
4.  (C)  President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights 
Nabeel Rajab told Pol/Econ Chief on May 16 that prior to the 
publishing of the open letter, Nabeel had been skeptical 
about the reports that one of the Bahraini detainees was 
tortured.  However, the Abu Ghariebprison scandal gave the 
allegation credibility. He told Pol/Econ Chief that he 
believes the problem is systemic and not isolated to a few 
young soldiers. 
 
5.  (C)  MFA Minister of State Abdelghaffar told CDA on May 
11 (before the British detainees\' open letter was reported in 
Bahrain) that Sunni Islamist parliamentarians had raised with 
him the reports of torture at Abu Gharieb and the possibility 
of Bahrainis being tortured at GTMO.  He said he discounted 
these allegations but there is new parliamentary heat on the 
MFA to do something.  Abdelghaffar said he knew a team had 
just gone to GTMO and found no particular complaints from the 
Bahraini detainees, but he asked if a Bahraini doctor could 
go look at them.  CDA told the MinState such a visit was most 
unlikely to receive approval.  Abdelghaffar understood but 
asked that we check. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  COMMENT.  On April 26 Emboff escorted a GOB 
delegation to GTMO that met with all six Bahraini detainees. 
The detainees did not lodge any complaints of mistreatment or 
abuse.  On April 27 and April 29, the GOB delegation met with 
detainee Juma Al-Dossari. Al-Dossari complained that he had 
been in solitary confinement for over a year.  Prison 
officials explained that Al-Dossari has attempted suicide at 
least seven times.  They placed him under suicide watch in an 
individual cell for his own protection.  EmbOff reported that 
GOB delegations visited GTMO on two previous occasions. 
Since April 2002, the Bahraini detainess have not formally 
complained of mistreatment or abuse.  For some GOB officials 
and societal leaders, the allegation that US prison guards 
tortured a Bahraini detainee at Guantanamo Bay has gained 
credibility in light of the Abu Gharieb prison scandal.  END 
COMMENT.

CAREFULLY 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford, reason 1.5 (d) 
 
1.  (C)  The editor in chief of the Akhbar al-Khaleej 
newspaper group told CDA and PAO over lunch on May 16 that 
the U.S. can regain some of its lost credibility with the 
Bahraini public if the soldiers responsible for torture at 
Abu Gharieb prison are punished sternly and visibly.  He 
expects the Bahraini public will follow the trials with very 
keen interest.  Some Bahrainis, including his children 
studying in the U.S., anticipate the soldiers will be 
expelled from the Army but released upon return to the U.S. 
Such an outcome would further reinforce widespread public 
sentiment that the American Government is not really 
interested in human rights in Iraq or anywhere else in the 
Arab World. 
 
2.  (C)  The editor said that by contrast if the trials are 
serious, explain the evidence fully and publicly, and serious 
prison terms result, many Bahrainis will conclude that the 
torture was truly the work of only a relatively small group 
and not a broader systemic problem.  The editor said the very 
best thing the U.S. Government could do would be to hold 
serious trials and ensure they are broadcast on television, 
including Arabic satellite networks.  He had no doubt 
millions of Arabs would watch the coverage closely.  He 
opined that Bahrain TV, for example, would surely cary the 
trials locally by linking to the satellite channels. 
 
3.  (C)  Speaking separately, the University of Bahrain 
president told PAO on May 16 that the transparency so far of 
the American investigation was a plus and was limiting to a 
small extent the real damage to American credibility. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  These comments track with what we are 
hearing from other contacts in Bahrain about the importance 
of the trials.  Meeting with us privately May 15 the Foreign 
Minister, for example, said the most important thing for the 
U.S. Government now is to hold the trials and punish the 
guilty.  It was striking that the Akhbar al-Khaleej editor, 
one of the most strident opponents of U.S. policy in the 
region, thought the trails help restore some of our 
credibility, especially if the trials were aired on TV.

SUBJECT: JAMES ZOGBY ENGAGES BAHRAINIS AND ADDRESSES ABU 
GHRAIB PRISON ABUSES 
 
 
1.   James Zogby, founder and President of the Arab 
American Institute and media commentator, visited Bahrain 
May 10-12, 2004.  His speaking tour was co-sponsored by 
the American Studies Center at the University of Bahrain 
and the Bahrain Center for Studies and Research, with 
partial funding from PAS.  Zogby spoke to a wide cross 
section of Bahrainis during two days of well-attended 
public lectures at the University, the Bahrain Center for 
Studies and Research(think tank), and round table 
discussions.  Charg hosted a majlis in the DCMR in 
Zogby\'s honor for parliamentarians, business 
representatives, and government officials.  The entire 
Arab diplomatic corps (Ambassadorial rank) attended one 
of his public lectures - the hotel ballroom was full. 
Given the timing of his visit, the number one topic of 
discussion was the treatment of Iraqi POWs in Abu Graib. 
The lack of progress on resolving the Palestine/Israel 
problem was also criticized by his audiences.  His visit 
received wide and positive coverage in Bahrain\'s press. 
 
2.  Zogby\'s visit coincided with a time when American 
credibility faces harsh challenges due to local concerns 
about the Abu Ghraib prison abuse.  Zogby faced tough 
crowds and criticism at all of his lectures.  One 
university student, who also studied in the U.S., accused 
Zogby of \"painting a rosy picture\" regarding the Arab- 
American political and social experience in the U.S.  A 
Bahraini government official asked him if the U.S. would 
ever \"have a fair and courageous President who could help 
solve the problems in the Middle East.\"  A leftist female 
columnist launched into a monologue at the Charge\'s 
majlis about \"the American culture of killing.\"  She 
believes that American culture is one that encourages the 
disrespect of other peoples, citing Abu Ghraib prison 
abuse as an example.  She asked Zogby to take the 
following message back to American policymakers:  \"In 
order for the U.S. to change its image in the region, it 
should stop killing people.\" 
 
3.  Zogby did an outstanding job connecting with his 
audiences.  (Comment: The columnist who gave him a hard 
time at the DCMR later stood in line to have her 
photograph taken with him.)  Zogby encouraged his 
audiences to be more proactive in shaping American 
perceptions about Arabs. \"The only way to change 
misperceptions is by creating new perceptions.\"  He 
called on Bahrainis and all Arabs to put aside their 
concerns about visa problems and harassment at airports 
and travel to the U.S.  He encouraged them to meet with 
Americans from all walks of life - not just to visit 
Disneyland or the East Coast.  This idea was particularly 
well received.  A senior MFA official agreed that to 
initiate real change both Americans and Arabs must see 
each other clearly through personal interaction.  The 
editor-in-chief of an Arabic daily, who introduced Zogby 
at one of his lectures, hoped that an American/Arab 
dialogue could be built on a foundation of the integrity 
demonstrated by those who came forward about the 
incidents in Abu Ghraib.  The editor praised the U.S. 
media who made the abuses public, stating, \"Let us not 
forget that these atrocities would have gone completely 
unnoticed had it not been for the integrity, honesty and 
decency of America\'s press.\" 
 
4.  Comment:  Zogby is a master; it is hard to overstate 
the usefulness of his visit.  We were fortunate to get 
him - he told Emboffs that he receives at least ten 
invitations a week to speak in the U.S. or overseas.  He 
accepted the invitation because he had not visited 
Bahrain for many years.  His integrity as a champion of 
Arab-American issues gave him hard earned credibility in 
the eyes of Bahrainis.  His message that America is not 
perfect, but is always working towards that goal, was 
particularly helpful.  N.b., He also provided a needed 
morale boost for Embassy FSNs, some of whom have been 
criticized by friends and family for continuing to work 
for the U.S. following Abu Ghraib.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN MAY SIGN BIG IRAN GAS DEAL AT YEAR\'S END 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert S. Ford, reason 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C/NF)  Bahraini CP Sheikh Salman bin Hamed told CDA on 
May 15 that Bahrain may conclude a major agreement to buy 
Iranian gas by the end of CY 2004.  Bahraini demand for 
natural gas is increasing with projects such as the expansion 
of the aluminum smelter go forward.  These projects are vital 
to Bahrain\'s economic development.  Salman noted that he is 
chairing the government committee negotiating a new, 
long-term supply deal with a foreign supplier. 
 
2.  (C/NF)  Bahrain has been exploring separately with Saudi 
Arabia, Qatar and Iran long-term supply agreements, the Crown 
Prince said.  Saudi Arabia has informed Bahrain that it is no 
longer interested in a supply agreement for Bahrain.  Thus, 
Bahrain is negotiating seriously with Qatar and Iran.  Price 
will be the essential issue, he said.  Commercial feasibility 
studies have concluded that the Bahraini industrial 
development projects using the natural gas will be 
commercially viable if Bahrain can secure a price below USD 1 
per metric ton. 
 
3.  (C/NF)  The Crown Prince cautioned that so far in the 
negotiations, the Iranians are offering a far superior deal. 
Monetizing their share of the North Dome gas field, they are 
offering the GoB a price of approximately USD 0.70-0.85 per 
metric ton.  By contrast, the Qataris have linked the natural 
gas price to a crude oil benchmark price.  At USD 18 per 
barrel, the Qatari gas will cost $1.10 per metric ton; at 
nearly USD 40 per barrel, the gas will cost upwards of $2.40. 
 Thus, the Crown Prince concluded, the Iranians are offering 
a dramatically cheaper price. 
 
4.  (C/NF)  CDA reminded the Crown Prince of U.S. Government 
views concerning Iran.  The Crown Prince said that even in 
Bahrain there are great sensitivities about inking a deal 
with Iran that would involve 400-600 million cubic feet per 
day - nearly fifty percent of Bahrain\'s consumption.  The 
price offered from Iran, however, was too good for Bahrain to 
ignore, he concluded.  He said the negotiations are not yet 
finished with Qatar, but the GoB needs to make a decision in 
December 2004.  He wanted the U.S. to understand Bahraini 
concerns ahead of time. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  It would be hard to overstate GoB 
sensitivities about Iran; senior Bahraini officials all view 
Iran as the single greatest threat to Bahraini security.  The 
Crown Prince underlined the importance of price in the 
decision, and certainly much of Bahrain\'s industrial exports 
depend on cheap gas.  It is possible he initiated this 
conversation to sensitize Washington early on to the 
potential Iranian deal.  It is also possible the GoB is 
hoping we will weigh in with Doha to secure a cheaper offer 
from the Qataris.

SUBJECT: PERSPECTIVE OF SOME SHI\'A WOMEN APPAREL INDUSTRY 
WORKERS 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Bahrain anticipates that the WTO-mandated 
end of textile quotas at the beginning of 2005 will cause its 
garment manufacturing sector to contract.  The Ministry of 
Industry estimates that there are 3,600 conservative Bahraini 
Shi\'a women working in this industry. There are few 
industries in which these Arab women are able to work limited 
by their adherence to conservative social mores. The loss of 
these jobs is politially salient considering an official 15 
percent unemployent rate that already disproportionately 
affects the Shia\' population.  During April and May 2004, 
PolOff visited more than half of the garment factories and 
surveyed 150 Bahraini Shi\'a female workers to gain insight 
into possible options for them.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------- 
THE FACTORIES 
------------- 
 
2.  (U)  At the start of 2003, there were 24 garment 
factories in Bahrain, employing over 13,000 foreign and 3,700 
Bahraini workers, mostly conservative Shi\'a women. In the 
last seven months nine factories have closed due to lack of 
orders and in anticipation of the WTO-mandated end of US 
textile quotas on January 1, 2005. The remaining 15 factories 
each employ anywhere from 250 - 1,200 Bahraini workers.  The 
Ministry of Industry estimates that 3,600 Bahrainis still 
work in the industry.  These factories manufacture clothing 
primarily for K-Mart, Sears, WalMart, JC Penney and The Gap. 
Textiles and apparel comprise 60 percent of Bahrain\'s total 
exports to the US.  Most factories segregate its Shi\'a female 
workers from the foreign male workers.  According to the 
Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry Textile Committee, 
over 90 percent of Bahraini female workers work in the 
finishing process, the lowest skill level of apparel 
manufacturing.  Factories provide separate prayer/locker 
rooms for women.  The monthly wage for 160 hours is BD120 
(USD318).  Workers do not receive private healthcare 
insurance but factories do make contributions for their 
pensions. (NOTE The GOB provides free healthcare to its 
citizens. END NOTE) 
 
------------------------ 
THE WOMEN...AND SOME MEN 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  The 150 women interviewed range from 21 - 42 years 
old and are single or divorced.  Most of them live in their 
parents\' homes in nearby Shi\'a neighborhoods. Ex-husbands of 
those who were previously married have custody of the 
children.  Family size ranged from 6 to 12 persons.  Unlike 
the older women, the younger ones do not contribute a large 
part of their salary to the family unit. The majority did not 
finish high school.  Several of the older women lamented that 
they dropped out of school to support the family and had no 
possibility to obtain a higher education. 
 
4.  (U)  Only a handful of women claim to make decisions 
independently and do not follow the guidance of husbands, 
fathers or brothers.  To keep abreast of current events, most 
of the older women read the Arabic local newspaper \"Al Ayam\" 
and watch \"Al Arabiya\" channel television.  The younger set 
used the Internet as its primary source of information and 
spend more than 10 hours per week in chat rooms.  More than 
half of the women interviewed voted in 2002 Municipal 
elections.  However, less than 20 voted in the 2002 national 
elections.  Only one woman, 30-year-old Mousa, boldly stated 
that she would run for office, if she could get a higher 
education first.  None of the women were members of NGOs or 
political societies. 
 
5. (U)  Unknown to both the President of the Textile Union 
and the Ministry of Industry Textile Affairs Representative, 
there are 11 Shi\'a men who work in the garment industry. 
Their ages range from 18 - 24 years old.  All of them are 
single, still live with their parents, high school graduates 
and members of the largest opposition society Al-Wifaq.  They 
use the Internet and read the independent Arabic local 
newspaper \"Al Wasat\" for their main sources of information. 
All who were eligible in 2002 (age 21) voted in both the 
national and municipal elections. A 23-year-old man named 
Ibrahim told PolOff on April 28 that he chose to work in the 
garment industry because he has aspirations of becoming a 
fashion designer.  But Ibrahim is the exception to the rule. 
The others stated that they work to support the family. 
Eighteen year old Jassim said that it was important to keep 
busy and do something positive.  Jassim told PolOff that so 
many young unemployed Shi\'a men get into trouble because they 
have no where to place their energy. 
 
--------- 
THE UNION 
--------- 
 
6.  (U)  For the most part, factory management allows union 
representatives access to workers.  However, the women 
interviewed unanimously view the textile union as not worth 
the monthly 500 fils (USD1.33) dues. At Continental Garment 
factory, the women workers designated five women to become 
union members and represent all of them.  This group of five 
women fields all complaints and demands to the union. 
Workers described union activities at other factories as far 
less organized.  The textile union has yet to bargain 
collectively with management on any issues. President of the 
Textile Trade Union Khadija Attiya told PolOff on May 12 that 
there are 250 dues-paying members out of a total of 12,000 
textile workers.  She claims that she has encountered some 
resistance from management to her efforts to recruit union 
members, and a couple of factories have forbidden her access 
to foreign workers.  Even though the 2002 Trade Union Law 
allows foreigners to join trade union, none have done so. 
Attiya cited that foreign workers are afraid to join for fear 
of losing their jobs and/or being repatriated.  She has not 
heard of any factory management threatening repatriation or 
loss of jobs.  She also admits that she has little support 
from the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions.  Attiya 
told us that she needs support and more training. 
 
---------- 
THE ISSUES 
---------- 
 
7.  (U)  The majority of women cited naturalization of Arab 
non-Bahrainis as the main issue facing indigenous ethnic 
Bahrainis, alleging that naturalized Sunni Yemenis and 
Syrians take finishing and sewing jobs away from Bahrainis. 
The second most important issue was sectarian discrimination 
against the Shi\'a. All agreed that housing is scarce and the 
cost of living is rising. However, they also acknowledged 
that women rights have greatly expanded. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
OPTIONS FOR THE FUTURE - THE WORKERS\' VIEWS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  Very few Bahraini women purposely chose to work in 
the apparel industry. Many asserted that they work at an 
apparel job because it earns the higher end of the \"minimum 
wage.\"  When asked what they would like to do if the apparel 
industry did not exist in Bahrain, only a handful thought 
they could be re-trained to become a secretary or an 
accounting clerk.  Several said that they would like to 
receive more education and pursue careers in nursing and 
teaching.  However, the overwhelming majority could not 
conceive of working at any other job. 
 
9.  (U) COMMENT.  The WTO-mandated end of textile quotas 
could cause several hundred conservative Shi\'a women to lose 
their jobs.  The loss of these jobs is politically relevant 
considering the high unemployment rate that already 
disproportionately affects the Shi\'a population. 
Unemployment is a main bone of contention between the GOB and 
the opposition.  In addition, the end of textile quotas and 
the possible effective date of US-Bahrain Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA) is January 1, 2005.  The FTA could be blamed 
for job losses resulting from the end of quotas, causing a 
public relations nightmare for both the USG and the GOB.  In 
order to mitigate the impact of the loss of these jobs, this 
issue will merit serious attention from the GOB, business 
community, the union and NGOs.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SPOT REPORT: BAHRAINI WOMEN ON ABU GHRAIB POWS 
 
REF:  STATE 55472 
 
1.  Bahraini women from all walks of life, including 
Sunni and Shia followers, have been sharing their 
thoughts and feelings about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse 
with Emboffs and our Bahraini Foreign Service Nationals. 
Although the region\'s reaction has already been heavily 
reported in the press, given the importance of Arab women 
to the reform process and MEPI\'s goals for the Women\'s 
Empowerment Pillar (reftel, para 23), post is sharing 
some of their reactions. 
 
2.  The wife of a Shura Council Member told a PAS FSN 
(after telling her to quit working for the U.S. Embassy 
over the issue) that she could not believe that American 
women were involved in the scandal; she feels betrayed by 
American women.  She added, \"I was a huge supporter of 
Bush freeing the Iraqis from Saddam.  But I\'ve changed my 
mind completely and I am truly disappointed and disgusted 
with the U.S. Administration.  I never thought that the 
U.S. would exhibit this much violence and hatred.  It 
will take the Arabs generations to get over this 
betrayal.\"  Fearing for her children and grandchildren, 
she added, \"If this is the way that the U.S. wants to 
preach democracy and human rights, then our future will 
only hold further disasters and violence and there can 
never be real security in the Gulf.\" 
 
3.  A U.S.-educated Bahraini photographer told the PAO 
that she was disgusted when she saw the photos depicting 
POW abuse specifically because of the participation of 
American women in the acts.  \"You should tell your 
military to pull all American female soldiers out of 
Iraq.  The next time an American woman is captured in 
Iraq, they will do despicable things to her.  And I won\'t 
blame them after what they have done to us Arabs.\" 
(Comment:  PAO was taken aback by her bitterness since 
she is a graduate of the Department of Defense Dependents 
School in Bahrain and went to college in the U.S.  Many 
of her childhood friends and classmates were Navy 
dependents with whom she is still in touch.) 
 
4.  Many of our female contacts are holding senior U.S. 
government officials personally responsible.  A U.S.- 
educated mother decried America\'s \"disrespect for Arab 
and Islamic customs\" and expressed real disappointment in 
Secretary Rumsfeld\'s surprise visit to Abu Ghraib.  \"It 
 
SIPDIS 
is disgusting what these people have done when they have 
told us that they are there to free Iraqis and protect 
them from human rights abuses under the Saddam regime.\" 
A young stay-at-home mom told our POLFSN, \"It was really 
offensive to see naked Arab men on TV being treated like 
animals, the means of torture were unnecessary and 
inhumane.  I felt insulted, angry, and very sad. The 
American Government is pushing its luck.\" 
 
5.  A conservative, veiled Bahraini woman of Palestinian 
descent told the Educational Advisor that abuse of all 
POWs is wrong no matter where it takes place.  She said, 
\"I would be equally horrified if the same torture and 
abuse were happening to an American prisoner because this 
is against human rights.  It is not a matter of who is to 
doing what to who, as much as the injustice from a human 
rights perspective.\" 
 
6.  Our RELO FSN, who comes from a more traditional 
sector of Bahraini society, reports that virtually all 
women in her majority-Shia lower income village are now 
calling for the U.S. to leave Iraq unconditionally due to 
the Abu Ghraib POW abuse.  These women are uneducated and 
lead simple lives, but they follow the news in Iraq. 
During a recent gathering in the home of a relative, the 
topic of conversation turned to Abu Ghraib.  One 
community leader summed it up for all of the women, \"We 
did support U.S. goals to remove Saddam.  We thought it 
would be a good thing.  We were wrong.\"

POST-ICCP GCC METROLOGY SYSTEM 
 
 
1. NIST\'s Stephen Carpenter briefed ECON on May 10 regarding 
response to his participation at the Second Middle East 
Measurement and Instrumentation Conference and Exhibition. 
Carpenter reported that Bahrain is interested in setting up 
for the Gulf a regional metrology system to complement the 
existing five regional centers in the EU, Americas, 
Asia-Pacific, Former Soviet States and Southern Africa. 
Carpenter said that Assistant Undersecretary of Commerce 
Ahmed Isa Bubshait approached him to request assistance in 
organizing a metrology center and possibly a calibration 
laboratory in Bahrain.  Carpenter added that UAE Deputy 
Director General of Metrology Rashid bin Fahad seemed 
supportive of Bahrain\'s proposed undertaking.  Carpenter told 
ECON that he encouraged Bubshait first of all to bring 
together representatives from other Gulf countries to seek 
uniformity and agreement.  At that point NIST could share its 
experiences in organizing the system in the Americas, 
Carpenter said.  The project, he noted, would require a needs 
assessment for each of the potentially involved countries, a 
determination of the organization\'s structure, establishment 
of the system\'s objectives, and a study of regional training 
needs and ways to satisfy them.

indicated to post their interest in setting up testing labs 
and a metrology system for the region in Bahrain.  Bubshait\'s 
approaching Carpenter signals that this interest is serious 
and persistent.  Testing labs would be a new industry for 
Bahrain, one that fits with the type of clean industry 
Bahrain hopes to attract.  The establishment of regional 
testing labs in Bahrain would create jobs and thus support 
the success of a bilateral Free Trade Agreement. 
Furthermore, following up on Bubshait\'s request will allow us 
an opportunity to help shape a workable post-ICCP standards 
system for the Gulf.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN INTERNATIONAL BANK (BIB) LIQUIDATION 
 
REF: 03 MANAMA 850 
 
1. SUMMARY: A May 4 Asset Realization Protocol (ARP) 
formally launched the liquidation of Bahrain International 
Bank (BIB) after nearly three years of post-9/11 
creditworthiness problems.  While poor bank management and 
strategy caused the failure, the Bahrain Monetary Agency 
(BMA) should have acted sooner and more decisively.  While 
BIB is the only bank to collapse recently in Bahrain, it is 
one of three banks troubled during the past year.  Taken 
together, these have tarnished Bahrain\'s image as a well- 
regulated banking center.  The BMA is taking steps to 
enhance its regulation of the sector, which should restore 
its reputation. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------- 
BIB GOES UNDER 
--------- 
 
2. Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) and investor efforts to 
resolve the financial standing of bankrupt Bahrain 
International Bank (BIB) have failed. The BIB was delisted 
from the Bahrain Stock Exchange, as recommended by the 
bank\'s temporary committee to the BMA\'s Capital Markets 
Control Directorate, which approved the move.  In a move 
sponsored by the BMA, On May 4 BIB shareholders, lenders, 
and depositors formally agreed to an Asset Realization 
Protocol defining the terms of sale to liquidate BIB assets 
to repay lenders, shareholders, and depositors. 
 
3. Bahrain International Bank (BIB) was established in 1982 
as an offshore commercial bank with approximately 7,600 
shareholders, primarily from the GCC and predominantly from 
Bahrain and Kuwait. The bank\'s principal operations included 
direct corporate investment and real estate development in 
the United States and Europe, as well as financial advisory 
services, according to Capital Intelligence (CI) ratings 
service. CI highlighted the recessionary period in the Gulf 
during the early to mid-eighties as a factor in the bank\'s 
early troubles in developing its commercial banking 
activities. This served as a rationale for the bank\'s focus 
on investment operations run primarily from its subsidiaries 
in the US and UK. However, subsequent downturns in the 
bank\'s investment portfolio, most significantly since 2001, 
had forced the bank to liquidate its U.S. and European 
corporate bond portfolios. The move intended to allow BIB to 
gain temporary liquidity in order to refinance the bank\'s 
debt, according to CI. 
 
4. BMA Executive Director of Banking Supervision, Dr. Khaled 
Ateeq, highlighted September 11 and the subsequent risk 
climate as overriding factors in the bank\'s downturn. 
Significant investments in the United States and the 
subsequent dramatic slide in investment returns hurt the 
bank\'s financial standing, he told EconFSN May 9. Although 
agreeing with the post-2001 trend, BIB term lender Gulf 
International Bank (GIB) Managing Director for Risk 
Management Mohannad Farouki stressed to EconFSN on May 18 
faults in BIB\'s broader strategy, which involved investments 
of short-term liabilities into long-term assets.  Farouki 
noted that BIB\'s post-2001 high yield investments were hit 
badly, while the impact on the bank\'s private equity 
portfolio was even more severe. 
 
---------- 
BMA STEPS IN-BUT TO NO AVAIL 
---------- 
 
5. Dr. Ateeq told EconFSN May 9 that the BMA had been aware 
of BIB\'s troubles from the outset and notified the bank\'s 
board of directors to increase capital in order to 
reestablish creditworthiness. However, Ateeq added, BIB\'s 
board could not raise the necessary capital and therefore 
did not fulfill the bank\'s obligations to its investors and 
depositors. In response to questions of effective financial 
supervision, Ateeq noted the significant efforts of the BMA 
over the past two years in seeking to find a recovery 
formula for the bank to save it from liquidation. Such 
measures were regarded as the BMA\'s preferred course of 
action in order to bolster the capacities of institutions 
and substantiate the regulator\'s supportive role in a 
banking hub. This is in line with BMA Governor Ahmed Al 
Khalifa\'s December 13, 2003 statements in the local press 
that the failure of financial institutions could impose 
significant costs on society as well as impact confidence 
Bahrain\'s banking system. 
 
6. The BMA cooperated with creditors to assist BIB\'s 
recovery. The bank was unable to overcome its liquidity 
problems due to bad management, Ateeq told EconFSN May 9. As 
a result, negotiated efforts undertaken by the BMA, 
creditors, depositors, and shareholders determined the 
corrective actions for the bank and eventually 
considerations of asset liquidation. In January 2004, an 
extraordinary general assembly meeting undertaken by the 
bank\'s principal shareholders resulted in an agreement to 
settle the bank\'s liabilities over the medium term. On May 
5, local newspapers reported the agreement reached May 4 to 
establish an Asset Realization Protocol (ARP) announcing 
BIB\'s liquidation. 
 
7. The agreement allowed for the establishment of a 
specialized committee including creditors and officials from 
the BMA, as well the appointment of an ARP manager. Both 
entities would be responsible for overseeing the liquidation 
or sale of BIB\'s assets. The final agreement, as stipulated 
under the ARP, called for 85 percent of revenue gained from 
assets sold to be distributed to depositors and 15 percent 
to bank creditors. Following the full repayment of 
depositors, the remainder of the proceeds will go to bank 
creditors, in accordance with BMA guidelines that give 
depositors priority, Ateeq told EconFSN May 9.  Any proceeds 
remaining after full repayment to depositors and creditors 
would be distributed to shareholders. GIB\'s Farouki 
suggested to EconFSN May 18 that finding a resolution to the 
BIB bankruptcy was not an easy matter and essentially a no- 
win situation for those involved. As a lender to BIB, 
Farouki did not expect GIB or other term lenders to receive 
more than 23 cents per dollar of assets sold. 
 
------- 
POINTING FINGERS: BANK MANAGEMENT, FINANCE MINISTER AND BMA 
ALL IMPLICATED IN BANK FAILURE 
-------- 
 
8. On April 14 local newspapers reported on parliamentary 
inquiries into the BIB affair. Parliamentarians raised 
questions of the BMA\'s role leading up to the bank\'s 
bankruptcy, possible penalties to banking executives, and 
questions about whether other banks in the country in the 
same situation. According to these reports, Minister of 
Finance and National Economy Abdullah Saif stressed the 
efforts of the BMA to resolve BIB\'s liquidity problems and 
highlighted that BIB\'s assets only accounted for 0.4 percent 
of Bahrain\'s total bank assets.  Saif placed the blame on 
the bank\'s board members and executives who failed to 
conform to BMA guidelines and were not qualified to 
effectively manage BIB. BIB\'s circumstances were brought up 
in later inquiries by parliamentarians into financial 
irregularities relating to the Minister\'s (mis-)management 
role as chairman of the national pension fund. Local 
newspapers on April 21 further accused the Minister of not 
taking assurances from the BMA regarding fund deposits in 
the Bahrain Saudi Bank, another bank suspected of financial 
irregularities. 
 
9. Reiterating his position that BIB\'s chief executive and 
board members were unfit to assume positions in Bahrain\'s 
banks, Ateeq told EconFSN May 9 that shareholders, 
creditors, and depositors were free to take legal action 
against BIB banking officials and chief officers. Farouki 
noted that the BIB collapse could have been avoided if the 
bank had not risked client money to pursue its investments 
in the first place. However, Farouki noted to EconFSN May 18 
the evident complexities in imposing more direct BMA-issued 
punishments on BIB and its executives. In the absence of 
practical punitive solutions, Farouki told EconFSN that he 
agreed with Ateeq\'s suggestion that legal cases brought 
forth by investors, lenders, and depositors would be the 
most effective course of action. 
 
------- 
BAHRAIN\'S BANKING IMAGE SUFFERED 
------- 
 
10. Farouki told EconFSN May 18 that irregularities 
involving three Bahrain-based banks-Bahrain Saudi Bank 
(BSB), Bahrain Middle East Bank (BMEB) and BIB--in the 
course of a year did tarnish the country\'s banking image. 
Potential collapse of BSB and BMEB was averted through BMA 
action. Only the BIB has declared bankruptcy. 
 
------- 
BMA INTERVENTION AT BAHRAIN MIDDLE EAST BANK HAVING EFFECT 
------- 
 
11. The only other bank in Bahrain currently facing 
difficulties is Bahrain Middle East Bank (BMEB), Ateeq told 
EconFSN May 9.  By contrast to BIB, BMEB is now in the 
process of arranging creditors and refinancing to re- 
establish the bank.  Ateeq emphasized that unlike the case 
of BIB, BEMB has made a commitment to the shareholders and 
others.  As a result of the BMA\'s regulatory guidance and 
supervision, the bank is very likely to survive, Ateeq 
added.  GIB\'s Farouki supported this assertion, stating May 
18 that as long as the bank effectively manages its expenses 
it will be able to recover. However, the Bahrain Middle East 
Bank case was not as bad as the BIB affair, Farouki told 
EconFSN. 
 
------- 
BMA TAKING ACTION TO IMPROVE REGULATION, BOLSTER IMAGE 
------- 
 
12. In response, the BMA is taking steps to improve bank 
regulation.  Pursuing initiatives to promote risk awareness 
in the country\'s banking industry, the BMA sponsored a risk 
survey conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers to gauge common 
issues facing the banking industry. The BMA also issued new 
corporate governance guidelines for banks in the country. 
The new guidelines define operational and managing 
supervision criteria for bank executives and board members 
in order to ensure effective management as well as ensure 
performance monitoring. In addition the BMA has sought to re- 
define punitive measures for banks not abiding by BMA 
regulatory guidelines and mandates, according to March 31 
local news articles. 
 
13. COMMENT: The BIB experience should serve as a case study 
in the value of transparency.  Through it, the BMA has 
accepted the principle that ignoring a bank\'s problem or not 
taking swift action in accordance with established 
regulation is counterproductive in the long run. 
Overlooking this problem for too long meant its resolution 
was not in the best interest of stakeholders and caused 
public embarrassment.  FTA commitments to greater financial 
services regulation and transparency combined with this 
lesson could improve the sector and enable it in time to 
recover its former luster.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI SHI\'A DEMONSTRATION TURNS VIOLENT -- YET 
AGAIN 
 
REF: MANAMA 00750 
 
1.  By Wednesday, 05/19/04, Post had anticipated a large 
demonstration in Bahrain for Friday, 05/21/04.  Our 
projection was based on calls by Hassan Nasrallah and 
Ayatollah Ali Sistani for Shi\'a to rise up and demand the 
withdraw of U.S. forces from Karbala and Najaf.  Multiple 
Embassy contacts corroborated our information that Bahraini 
Shi\'a planned to demonstrate, adding that many intended to 
wear symbolic white \"death shrouds,\" an ominous gesture.  As 
noted in RefTel, Post issued a warden message on 05/19/04 
that warned Americans of the potential disturbances. 
 
2.  As expected, at 1600 on Friday, 05/21/04 following 
afternoon prayers, a large crowd began to gather in the Seef 
district of Bahrain (approx. 6km from the Embassy).  Several 
eyewitnesses reported to RSO that some of the individuals 
appeared to be carrying \"sticks and rocks.\"  The stated 
intention of the demonstration\'s organizers, the Islamic 
Enlightenment Society and the Al Wefaq National Islamic 
Society, was to march peacefully along a simple circular 
route. 
 
3.  By 1615, the number of protesters quickly swelled to 
around 4,000 - 5,000.  What happened next is somewhat 
nebulous because the police closed all streets approaching 
the demonstration area.  From our understanding of reports 
from multiple sources, GOB riot police stopped the protesters 
from continuing along their desired route.  This stoppage 
incited the crowd to violence including rock throwing.  By 
1630, RSO received the first reports of tear gas launches. 
As the main body of the crowd began to flee from the gas, a 
senior Shi\'a leader and march organizer, Shaikh Isa Qassim, 
was reportedly knocked down and injured. 
 
4.  Shaikh Isa Qassim\'s injury apparently incited the crowd 
to higher levels of violence.  By 1700, the momentum had 
shifted to the protesters, who charged and dispersed the riot 
police.  Moments later, RSO received reports that a group of 
hooligans had commandeered a police vehicle (Land Rover 
Defender), overturned it, and set it afire.  Chaos and 
violence followed for the next thirty minutes until the riot 
police regrouped at around 1730.  Additionally at 1730, Al 
Wefaq leader, Shaikh Ali Salman, addressed the frenzied crowd 
and called for control and an end to the violence.  Between 
the riot police re-deployment and Shaikh Ali Salman\'s 
appeals, the violence subsided and calm was restored by 1800. 
 
5.  On Saturday, 05/22/04, local newspapers were reporting 13 
people injured during the demonstration.  One daily printed a 
photograph of flag-waving youths rejoicing next to the 
burning police vehicle.  King Hamad was quoted as saying he 
was \"not pleased\" with the violence.  At no time was the U.S. 
Embassy approached or targeted by this group of protesters. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  Post is not at all surprised by the violence 
that erupted at this demonstration.  As we have seen during 
the last several planned \"peaceful\" marches, there is 
consistently an element in these crowds intent on engaging 
the police and inciting violence.  RSO believes that 
trouble-makers from previous demonstrations are neither 
detained beyond a few days nor punished beyond a nominal BD 
50.000 fine (about USD $133.00).  This apparent lack of 
punishment has encouraged repeat offenses.  Also, Post 
harbors genuine concern about potential future 
demonstrations.  When influential Shiite leaders call for 
action, the Bahraini Shi\'a majority (approx. 80 per cent) 
feel obligated to comply.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SOME BAHRAINIS RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PLAN FOR 
PROBABLE TEXTILE INDUSTRY CONTRACTION 
 
REF: MANAMA 726 
 
1.  SUMMARY. Assistant USTR for Labor WIlliam Clatanoff, who 
visited Bahrain May 9-13, sounded a clarion call warning to 
Bahrainis that its textile and garment industry is in danger 
from the WTO-mandated end to the textile quota system.  He 
made clear that the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is 
not a panacea to save the industry.  It could, he said, save 
some textile firms and some jobs, but Bahrainis need to 
prepare for the worst.  Bahrainis across the board heard the 
call and some appeared inspired to take action.  If Bahrainis 
do not take action, Post expects that the political 
opposition may mistakenly attribute the loss of garment 
industry jobs to the FTA and not the WTO.  The average 
conspiracy-minded Bahraini easily could conclude that the GOB 
and USG colluded to improverish already poor Shi\'a families. 
USG technical assistance to help address this problem could 
keep us on an even public relations keel. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
END OF TEXTILE QUOTAS 
--------------------- 
 
2.  AUSTR Clatanoff visited Bahrain to raise awareness about 
the potential negative impact of the phase-out of textile 
quotas on January 1, 2005 in accordance with the WTO 
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) (see reftel). 
Clatanoff met with GOB officials, parliamentarians, the 
business community, concerned NGOs and the union federation 
to discuss the end of the ATC transition period and possible 
options for re-employing hundred of Bahraini workers who may 
lose their jobs. 
 
----------------- 
FTA IS NO PANACEA 
----------------- 
 
3.  After listening to the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry\'s (BCCI) Ready-made Garment Committee describe how 
the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will double Bahrain\'s existing 
textile market, Clatanoff politely refuted the Committee\'s 
conclusions.  As he had done in every previous meeting, 
Clatantoff noted that the Bahraini textile industry\'s labor 
costs are 10 times China\'s. Even optimal FTA negotiated 
Tariff Preference Levels (TPL) alone would not overcome 
China\'s labor cost advantage.  Clatanoff instead asserted 
that the FTA cannot save Bahrain\'s current textile industry 
nor is it reasonable for Bahrainis to expect it to expand. 
What the US-Bahrain FTA can do, he said, is ease the 
transition for the Bahrain garment industry to adjust to 
world market competition. To overcome world wage 
differentials,  Bahrain would have to leverage other 
advantages.  For example, Clatanoff noted, key US importers 
and their customers ascribe to codes of conduct that mandate 
purchasing only from countries that guarantee workers freedom 
of association and the right to organize and bargain 
collectively. 
 
---------------------- 
WHAT CAN BAHRAINIS DO? 
---------------------- 
 
3.  Clatanoff advised Bahraini interlocutors that they should 
look at four aspects of labor market restructuring. 
 
-  Refocus the textile industry.  The business community 
could organize trade delegations to the US to solicit US 
companies to set up shop in Bahrain.  The textile companies 
could expand their customer base and market themselves to US 
clients that have corporate ethics policies that demand 
factories with good working conditions, quick-turn-around, 
expedient logistics and the right for workers to form unions. 
 
-  Identify new industries for conservative Shi\'a women.  The 
business community could work with the Ministry of Industry 
to identify new industries to which garment workers can 
transfer. 
 
-  Immigration policy and Bahrainization.  The Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) could limit the issuance of 
foreign work visas, allowing for job replacement by 
Bahrainis. 
 
-  Retraining.  MOLSA could coordinate with the union 
federation and training institutes to offer re-training for 
positions in a new sector or for garment positions that are 
vacant due to Bahrainization. 
 
------------------------- 
PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN 
------------------------- 
 
4.  Clatanoff stressed the need for a public awareness 
campaign to explain that the end of the textile quota system 
may cause a loss of jobs in the sector.  Alerting the public 
ahead of time should lessen any shock or anger by the Shi\'a 
community.  Such a reaction could trigger a political 
backlash, he worried.  Clatanoff continued that the public 
relations campaign needs to separate the possible job losses 
resulting from the end of the textile quota system from the 
FTA.  The coincidental entry into force of the FTA and the 
expiration of worldwide quotas could create opportunities for 
people to blame textile sector job losses on the FTA.  This 
could become a public relations nightmare for both the GOB 
and the USG. Both the GOB and the USG should publicly 
elaborate on what the FTA can and cannot do to help the 
sector. MOFNE Acting Director of Economic Planning Yousif 
Humood told EconOff on May 9 that he is willing to launch a 
public awareness effort after the last round of FTA 
negotiations concludes. 
 
-------------------------------- 
BAHRAINI REACTION TO SUGGESTIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  For the most part, the GOB and the business community 
were in favor of undertaking measures to aid the garment 
industry.  Initially, BCCI\'s presentation described expansion 
of the industry.  But after listening to Clatanoff challenge 
its assumptions about the FTA, BCCI Ready-made Garments 
Committee Chairman Abdul Ali Al-Aali told Emboffs on May 12 
that his committee would be willing to discuss the 
possibility of organizing a delegation to the US to attend 
trade shows to sell Bahrain to US companies. Taking into 
consideration the conditions under which conservative Shi\'a 
women work, Ministry of Industry Director of Information Sami 
Ahmed Hussain Kadhem told PolOff on May 10 that he already 
has identified factory work such as electronics assembly, 
downstream aluminum products manufacture, airline food 
preparation, and revitalization of handicrafts production as 
possible alternate industries.  MOLSA Assistant 
Undersecretary for Training Abdul Ellah E. Al-Qassimi told 
Emboffs on May 11 that his division is ready to offer any 
kind of re-training to transition these workers.  MOLSA 
Director of Labor Relations Ali A. Al-Khalifa told PolOff on 
May 11 that a new immigration policy is being discussed in 
conjunction with Bahrainization and unemployment insurance. 
The Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council for Women 
(SCW) Hala Al-Ansari told Emboffs on May 15 that SCW is 
willing to provide some funding and training for women in 
leadership and empowerment.  To ensure success by so many 
different entities, Al-Ansari suggested that a foreign 
consultant be hired to coordinate implementation by all 
concerned parties. 
 
6.  At a luncheon where Clatanoff met NGOs and the union 
together, president of the textile union Kadija Ali Attiya 
came away inspired by the support offered by other NGO 
representatives attending the event.  Attiya told PolFSN on 
May 18 that she was previously unaware of the expiration of 
bilateral textile quotas.  She lamented that she is only one 
person with no staff, unable to reach every worker and to 
organize a \"save jobs\" campaign.  Public Freedoms and 
Democracy Watch Vice President Nizar Al-Qari offered his 
organization\'s full support.  Al-Qari also offered to draft 
letters for Attiya to the GOB, the trade union federation and 
the business community to seek recommendations for solutions. 
  Bahrain Women\'s Society Vice President Soroor Qarooni 
offered Attiya help planning a campaign to inform garment 
workers of the situation. 
 
7.  One official thought it was wrong to focus on the plight 
of these 3,500 Shi\'a women.  Crown Prince\'s Court Economic 
Advisor Sirene Al-Shirawi told Emboffs on May 9 that free 
market forces would reshape Bahrain\'s labor market. 
Subsidizing or protecting any industrial sector would hinder 
that process.  Al-Shirawi downplayed the implication that the 
loss of 3,500 Shi\'a jobs would be highly publicized by the 
opposition.  \"There will be pain, but it will pass,\" she 
said. Al-Shirawi said she was willing to consider making 
these women a case study for unemployment insurance in the 
Crown Prince\'s labor reform study. 
 
8.  COMMENT.  Bahrainis will need to work together to address 
 anticipated Bahraini textile worker redundancies. 
Clatanoff\'s previous experience as Advisor to GOB\'s Minister 
of Labor in 1981-1984 and FTA Chief Labor Negotiator were 
great selling points with the Bahrainis. His personal and 
professional experience lent credibility to his suggestions. 
If Bahrainis do nothing to mitigate the loss of these garment 
industry jobs, Post expects that the opposition will have 
another opportunity to highlight the GOB\'s sectarian 
discrimination against the Shi\'a. The opposition also may 
mistakenly attribute the loss of garment industry jobs to the 
FTA and not the WTO.  The average conspiracy-minded Bahraini 
easily could conclude that the GOB and USG colluded to 
improverish already poor Shi\'a families. USG technical 
assistance to help address this problem could keep us on an 
even public relations keel. END COMMENT.

FEMALE IRAQI POWS 
 
 
1.  Embassy Manama requests guidance to respond to press 
accounts about abuse of female POWs in prisons in Iraq. 
Several stories ran on the front pages of Bahrain\'s 
Arabic and English language dailies on 5/29 (see para 
three for headlines), quoting sources in Baghdad about 
the rape of female prisoners.  These sources included the 
two Iraqi NGOs, \"The Union of Detainees and Prisoners\" 
and \"International Occupation Watch Center,\" and 
professors at Baghdad University.  The Gulf Daily News 
reported, \"a mother a four, arrested in December, killed 
herself after being raped by US guards in front of her 
husband.\"  The Bahrain Tribune reported, \"According to 
Iman Khamas, head of the International Occupation Watch 
Center, a woman prisoner said her cellmate had been 
rendered unconscious for 48 hours.  She had been raped 
seventeen times in one day by Iraqi police in the 
presence of American soldiers.\"  Arabic daily Akhbar Al 
Khaleej also reported that, \"several women POWs were 
killed by their families after coming out of Abu Ghraib 
pregnant due to rape.\" 
 
2.  In addition to the print press, Al Arabiya Satellite 
Channel carried an exclusive, seven-minute interview with 
recently-freed Iraqi woman POW Emtithal Al Qassimi on 
5/29 at 1300 (the interview was re-aired throughout the 
day and again on 5/30).  The ex-POW, in her late fifties, 
was dressed in a black hijab and she described her 
treatment and the treatment of other inmates in the 
Baghdad airport and later in Abu Ghraib.  She stated that 
she witnessed approximately 120 Iraqi prisoners being 
stripped down and then trampelled on by their American 
captors.  She also said that she had seen female 
prisoners sustain permanent damage, including partial 
paralysis, as a result of their injuries.  (Comment:  A 
PAS FSN reported that her mother burst into tears after 
watching the interview.)

1.(U) This is an action message.  Please see Para 5. 
 
2.(C) Bahrain expects to complete its work to bring the 
article 98 agreement into force in 10-14 days, Assistant 
Undersecretary for Cooperation and Follow up Shaikh Abd 
al-Aziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa told POL/ECON Chief on May 9. 
Senior officials and lawyers are still debating which 
methodology to use - an exchange of notes, or a Royal decree, 
Abd al-Aziz related.  Given the Abu Ghraib revelations in 
Iraq, he commented, the GOB has no desire whatsoever to 
notify parliament or the public of the existence of the 
article 98 agreement, which mitigates against the Royal 
decree approach.  Only five officials at the Foreign 
Ministry, Shaikh Abd al-Aziz emphasized, know of the 
existence of this agreement. 
 
3.(C) Shaikh Abd al-Aziz said that they are looking closely 
at the possibility of limiting the duration of the agreement. 
 This, he stated, might allow them to bring the agreement 
into force via an exchange of notes.  Shaikh Abd al-Aziz 
noted that the U.S. and Bahrain\'s signature of the agreement 
complicates such a process.  He wondered if a clause limiting 
the duration of the agreement could be included in the 
exchanged diplomatic notes. 
 
4.(C) Shaikh Abd al-Aziz also drew POL/ECON Chief\'s attention 
to the use of the word \"ratified\" in the language of the note 
we proposed for the exchange.  He commented that use of this 
word makes his job more difficult because Bahraini lawyers 
immediately insist that \"ratification\" of an agreement 
requires National Assembly approval. 
 
5.(C) ACTION REQUEST:  Post would appreciate the Department\'s 
guidance on whether we would be willing to limit the duration 
of the agreement and how that could be achieved given that we 
have already signed the text.  Post would also appreciate 
guidance on whether there are substitutes for \"ratified\" or 
\"ratification\" that could be used in an eventual exchange of 
notes.  Charge is likely to see the Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs on May 12 and could raise this issue then.

SUBJECT: ARTICLE 98 RATIFICATION IN BAHRAIN:  WE CAN GET IT 
BUT MAY BE MAKING A MISTAKE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann.  Reasons 1.4(B)(D). 
 
1.  (C)  King Hamad has promised that he will bring into 
force the Article 98 exclusion agreement.  The foreign 
minister is struggling to find a way to carry this out 
without causing a political explosion in Bahrain.  I believe 
the GOB will honor its commitment to us, but I question 
whether we are actually furthering our own strategic 
interests. 
 
2.  (C)  I believe there are strong reasons to credit the 
many high level assurances we have received that Bahrain will 
never, under any circumstances, turn an American official or 
former official over to the International Criminal Court.  To 
do so would be contrary to the fundamental strategic 
relationship that underpins Bahrain\'s security and survival. 
The bilateral relationship is a key pillar of King Hamad\'s 
strategic view of the world and he would not undermine it by 
surrendering U.S. personnel.  Thus, what we get for 
ratification is a legal formula without any real substantive 
change, at least in the Bahraini context. 
 
3.  (C)  Yet, if our Article 98 agreement becomes public it 
could touch off a major political problem, pulling Bahrain\'s 
support for our military into the middle of a domestic 
firestorm. The Shi\'a opposition is looking for issues on 
which to force confrontation with the government.  They want 
to provoke intense responses against which they could 
mobilize public support that is now inadequate to their 
needs.  The abuse of Iraqi prisoners is Abu Ghraib has made 
the whole issue of American \"criminal\" behavior a white hot 
issue in Bahrain as it is in the rest of the Arab world.  A 
leak of a concluded Article 98 agreement at this time and in 
these circumstances would be an issue tailor made for the 
opposition to take to the streets. Anti-government MPs would 
surely rise and demand that it be revoked.  Opposition 
deputies in parliament would also make a case that the 
constitution was being violated by secret passage of what 
ought to be publicly ratified treaties.  The Article 98 
ratification would certainly be undone. Moreover, all of this 
focus on the security relationship would tempt political 
opponents to try to expand the debate to other \"surrenders\" 
of Bahrain rights, in such matters as the Defense Cooperation 
Agreement. 
 
4.  (C)  My understanding is that the USG has no very certain 
way of protecting the confidentiality of an agreement since 
it must be reported under the Case Act. 
 
5.  (C)  As long as our instructions are to secure Article 98 
agreement, this embassy will do everything possible to carry 
out those instructions.  However, I believe I have a 
responsibility to tell you that in my judgment pressuring 
formal ratification has large potential political pain for 
infinitesimal gains.  Our desire for formal ratification of 
an Article 98 agreement now ought to be reconsidered.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR QUESTIONS GOB THREATS TO SHUT DOWN 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann for 1.4(b)(d). 
 
1.(C) SUMMARY:  Labor Minister Majeed al-Alawi accused the 
Bahrain Centre for Human Rights of violating Bahrain\'s laws 
and its own charter by conducting \"political\" activities in 
response to the Ambassador\'s question about the ministry\'s 
threat to revoke the Centre\'s license.  Al-Alawi also accused 
the Centre of affiliation with \"extremists\" like Bahrain 
Freedom Movement leader Saeed Shihabi and al-Wefaq Vice 
President Hassan Mushaimaa.  Al-Alawi\'s comments echoed those 
of Industry Minister and royal confidante Hasan Fakhro to the 
departing DCM.  Both the Ambassador and DCM noted that 
revoking the license could damage Bahrain\'s reputation. 
Al-Alawi said that if he had to pull the license, the Centre 
could sue in court.  Centre President Nabeel Rajab rejected 
the government claims and said the Labor Ministry had not 
responded to his official request for details of the Centre\'s 
\"transgressions.\"  He denied ties to \"extremists.\"  The 
Centre is both a legitimate human rights organization and 
very much on the side of the political opposition.  We doubt 
the GOB will pull the Centre\'s license, but we should expect 
the GOB to criticize the Centre whenever it exposes the GOB 
for human rights shortcomings.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(C) During his May 26 farewell call on Labor Minister 
Majeed al-Alawi, the Ambassador questioned the ministry\'s 
public threat to revoke the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights\'s 
license.  The Ambassador noted that following through on the 
threat could damage Bahrain\'s international reputation as a 
strong supporter of human rights.  Al-Alawi, a former leader 
of Bahrain\'s exiled political opposition, surprisingly 
accused the Centre of violating Bahrain\'s societies law by 
undertaking \"political\" activities and for violating 
Bahrain\'s law against promoting \"sectarianism.\"  Al-Alawi 
stressed that the Centre\'s charter stated that it would only 
conduct human rights research and training.  He further 
accused the Centre of associating with political extremists 
like Bahrain Freedom Movement leader Saeed al-Shihabi and 
al-Wefaq Vice President Hassan Mushaimaa.  Al-Alawi noted 
that two founders of the Centre, human rights activist Hasan 
Moussa and hardline opposition intellectual Aziz Abul, had 
resigned from the Centre because its activities had strayed 
from its original goals into politics.  He closed with the 
argument that if he pulled the Centre\'s license, it could 
take its case to the courts. 
 
3.(C) At the same time that the Minister was lambasting the 
Centre for \"political\" activities, his Director of Labor 
Relations was agreeing with our POLOFF to conduct a joint 
training program with the Centre for worker abuse hotline 
operators.  As part of Bahrain\'s efforts to fight trafficking 
in persons, both the Ministry and the Centre operate hotlines 
to help immigrant workers.  The Embassy plans to fund the 
training program through the MEPI small grants program. 
 
4.(C) One week earlier, outgoing DCM Robert Ford made a 
similar query to Industry Minister and royal confidante 
Hassan Fakhro, who responded in a similar vein but with a 
personal twist.  Fakhro commented that the government thought 
Centre President Nabeel Rajab was a \"good guy,\" but Centre 
Vice President Abd al-Hadi al-Khawaja was involved in 
unacceptable activities.  Ford suggested that by their nature 
human rights advocacy groups will engage in activities that 
could be views as \"political.\"  He also advised Fakhro that 
revoking the Centre\'s license would harm Bahrain\'s reputation. 
 
5.(C) On June 2, Centre President Nabeel Rajab advised 
POL/ECON Chief that he has heard similar accusations from 
others.  He stated that the Centre restricts its activities 
to support for U.N. designated human rights issues, like 
insuring that detained individuals receive due process 
rights.  He commented that he had written a letter to the 
Labor Ministry asking it to specify the activities the 
ministry claimed were against the law.  Rajab said that he 
still has not received an answer. 
 
6.(C) With respect to the other charges, Rajab noted that the 
Centre had folded its committee to defend the petition 
detainees after al-Wefaq had tried to take over committee\'s 
activities, and commented that al-Wefaq had been criticized 
in internet chat rooms for its slow response to defend its 
activists after their arrests.  Rajab denied any contact with 
Saeed al-Shehabi.  He added that political activist Aziz Abul 
had rejoined the Centre and would be representing it next 
week at an international human rights conference.  As an 
aside, Rajab noted that the Labor Ministry continues to deny 
the Centre a license to establish an abused workers\' shelter 
while not following through on its own commitment to 
establish its own shelter. 
 
7.(C) In a further move against the Centre, Bahrain\'s 
Attorney General stated that the Centre\'s involvement in 
support of the petition detainees was outside the scope of 
its charter.  Rajab told POL/ECON Chief June 2 that the 
statement was a response to a letter sent to the Attorney 
General asking if the charges against the detainees released 
by the King\'s order had been dropped.  The letter, he said, 
also asked if the released individuals might later face 
prosecution on the same charges.  Rajab said that Human 
Rights Watch and other international human rights 
organizations had recommended that he write such a letter. 
 
8.(C) COMMENT:  Democracy is new to Bahrain, and all actors 
-- governmental and non-governmantal -- are learning.  To our 
knowledge, the Centre has not crossed the line into political 
activities, but the way it has presented its research on 
discrimination and Bahrain\'s penal code has been used by 
others (al-Wefaq and the Bahrain Freedom Movement) for 
political purposes.  We doubt the GOB will pull the Centre\'s 
license anytime soon, but the GOB, which is unaccustomed to 
public criticism, could continue to snipe publicly at some 
Centre activities while it continues to work with it on 
others (TIP projects for instance).  END COMMENT.

Association, and provided extremely useful consultations 
at the University\'s new Communications Department.  They 
have also just conducted a very successful training 
workshop (see para 2) and have contacted appropriate 
Bahraini attorneys to attend a media and the law workshop 
this summer.  Post\'s MEPI working group evaluation of 
Internews in Bahrain:  definitely worth continuing. 
 
2. The first phase of the MEPI-funded Internews Network 
journalism training was a real success, providing needed 
skills to young Bahraini journalists.  The May 22-26 
workshop was attended by fifteen journalists, focusing on 
the role of journalists in a more open society, the 
ethics of the profession, and basic skills.  The course 
was spot on - both from our own observations and from the 
trainees themselves.  Internews Middle East Director 
Karim Alrawi, Training Coordinator Sally Sami, and 
Trainer Daniel Boylan also called on the Minister of 
Information who expressed his full support for journalism 
training and requested that Internews offer more training 
in Bahrain, including the broadcast media.  Post strongly 
concurs.  We would like Internews to conduct a workshop 
on the difference between accurate investigative 
reporting and writing opinion pieces/editorializing, a 
real problem in the Arab media.  Post looks forward to 
the second phase of the Internews training in November 
2004, which will improve internet skills and e- 
journalism.

SUBJECT: LETTER FROM AMBASSADOR TO JUSTICE O\'CONNOR 
 
 
1.  Following is the text of a letter the Ambassador sent 
directly to Justice O\'Connor. 
 
Begin text: 
 
June 5, 2004 
 
Dear Justice O,Connor: 
 
As I prepare to leave Manama to serve as Counselor for 
Political-Military Affairs in Baghdad, I wanted to update you 
on judicial reform in Bahrain.  You once told me that you did 
not want the Arab Judicial Forum (AJF) to be another 
&one-off event.8  I can say with pleasure that judicial 
reform in Bahrain has hit the ground running. 
 
Thanks to the AJF,s ability to identify judicial reform 
needs, MEPI approved funding for ABA,s judicial reform 
program.  ABA,s resident legal expert John Hermina has been 
in Bahrain since January 2004.  John works directly with 
Justice Minister Al Arrayed and together they have begun 
major changes at the Justice Ministry. 
 
In January, John Hermina accompanied a group of Bahraini 
prosecutors to France and the United States for training. 
Shortly after his return, the Ministry of Justice contracted 
the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance (BIBF) to train 
judges in commercial law.  The Justice Minister was telling 
me the other day that 17 judges attended the latest seminar 
on Islamic Banking and Money Laundering.  Sessions have been 
fully attended, vibrant and interactive.  John is now working 
with BIBF to develop a full continuing education curriculum. 
 
To increase transparency, the Ministry of Justice placed last 
February its very first public announcement for the 
recruitment of 20 new judges.  Our contacts in the legal 
community told us that this bold move is confirmation that 
the Minister is serious about reform and more positive 
changes are coming. 
 
In an unprecedented move, the Justice Minister sacked in 
March six Shari,a Court judges who were known for accepting 
bribes and coercing sex from female litigants.  I recall 
Minister Al Arrayed telling me that reforming Shari,a courts 
was off limits.  Women activists have publicly lauded this 
move. 
 
In April Minister Al Arrayed and John Hermina started to 
tackle alternative dispute resolution by establishing an 
Office of Mediation.  Based on criteria established by the 
Ministry, the Court Clerk now is able to give a case a 
mediation date in lieu of a court date.  In May the Justice 
Ministry completed a survey to assess the current conditions 
of its IT systems so it can install new software for a case 
management system. 
 
Minister Al Arrayed assures me that he will sustain the 
momentum.  In fact he and John Hermina traveled to Cairo last 
week to tour Egypt,s Judicial Institute.  The Minister was 
able to observe first-hand Egypt,s judicial training program 
for new judges and spent time interviewing new judges. 
 
All these recent changes were only possible due to your 
willingness to get involved with judicial reform in the 
Middle East and the Arab Judicial Forum.  Your efforts were 
well spent. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
Ronald E. Neumann

REF: A. MANAMA 802 
 
     B. MANAMA 696 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann for reason 1.4(d). 
 
1.(U) This is an Action Message.  Please refer to Para 10. 
 
2.(S/NF) Embassy Emergency Action Committee reviewed refs A 
and B in light of recent developments in Saudi Arabia and 
existing threats in Bahrain.  While the Embassy will maintain 
diplomatic pressure on the GOB to address our security 
concerns related to Bahraini Sunni extremists affiliated with 
Al-Qaida, we believe ref A visit provided a separate, 
bureaucratic avenue to build a stronger GOB capacity to deal 
with domestic terrorism threats.  Ref A made clear the lack 
of consensus among Bahraini legal system actors regarding the 
application of existing Bahraini laws criminalizing inchoate 
crime as well as considerable ignorance about the importance 
of stopping terrorists in the planning stages.  Ref A also 
highlighted that Bahrain\'s legal system is in the midst of a 
major overhaul.  Nearly all of the GOB\'s prosecutors are 
newly hired and could benefit from training on counter 
terrorism, terrorism-related investigations, detention, and 
prosecution.  The Justice Minister stated that he would 
support training for prosecutors on inchoate crime and 
criminal investigation techniques, but he would insist on 
playing a major role in the development and management of the 
training program. 
 
3.(SBU) At the end of ref A visit, Department of Justice 
attorneys Reynolds and Schwendiman reviewed options for 
addressing Bahraini legal actors\' need and desire for 
training with EMBOFFS.  The discussion identified three areas 
of need when it comes to Bahrain\'s criminal justice capacity 
for handling terrorism and terrorism related investigations, 
detention, and prosecutions: 
 
(a) education and skills training regarding inchoate crimes, 
i.e., conspiracy (\"agreement\"), solicitation, attempt; 
 
(b) getting maximum benefit out of the use of the twelve 
international terrorism conventions and the chemical and 
biological weapon conventions through their full adoption, 
proper legislative implementation and by educating and 
developing the skills of those who ought to be using them so 
they can be effective using them; and, 
 
(c) general legal education and practical skills development 
(e.g., evidence, standards of proof, burdens of proof, 
conducting investigations, managing investigations, making 
charging decisions, marshaling evidence for use in presenting 
criminal cases that meet international standards, effectively 
using detention within international human rights limits, 
courtroom practice, etc.) for newly selected Public 
Prosecutors. 
 
4.(U) Post proposes an early academic exchange in Bahrain at 
the University of Bahrain College of Law on the subject of 
inchoate crime and criminal law practice generally.  We 
recommend that two professors from the S.J. Quinney College 
of Law of the University of Utah travel to Bahrain, a U.S. 
District Court Judge, and a Department of Justice lawyer 
engage in seminars with the faculty and students at the UOB 
College of Law.  The people recently selected as judges and 
Public Prosecutors should be enlisted to attend the seminars. 
 The seminars should be true exchanges, not lectures or 
instruction, so that they are an opportunity for our people 
to learn more detail, through discussion and observation, 
about the Bahraini system and about the state of Bahraini 
practice regarding inchoate crime and criminal law practice 
in Bahrain.  Such a visit would  be an opportunity to 
establish relationships with academics and practitioners that 
can be used to help develop a resident program for Bahraini 
visitors that is an important feature of the overall program 
for meeting the needs we have identified. 
 
5.(U) S.J. Quinney College of Law Professors Erika Luna and 
Wayne McCormack have indicated to Assistant Attorney 
Schwendiman their willingness to travel to Bahrain as early 
as this summer to conduct a seminar.    Professor Luna and 
Professor McCormack are recognized criminal law scholars with 
reputations as stellar teachers.  They have extensive 
knowledge of comparative criminal law and constitutional law 
including knowledge of laws in Arab and Islamic states.  If 
funding could be obligated for a summer program, we would 
approach the University of Bahrain to host the program.(NOTE: 
 Markus Zimmer, Clerk of the District Court of Utah and 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Schwendiman of the U.S. Attorney\'s 
Office for the District of Utah now have extensive knowledge 
of Bahrain\'s legal system and actors.  Both have solid 
connections with the faculty of the S.J. Quinney College of 
Law.  END NOTE) 
 
6.(U) The Embassy recommends that we follow the academic 
exchange with a four-week resident program in the United 
States for ten Bahrainis (2 Public Prosecutors, 2 UOB law 
professors, 2 judges, 2 court administrators, and 2 defense 
attorneys) who have English language skills that are good 
enough to permit them to participate in the discussions and 
programs with ease without the need for translation.  It 
makes sense to us that the resident program should be hosted 
by the U.S. Attorney\'s Office of the District of Utah.  We 
are confident that the University of Utah would support the 
concept, as would judges in the United States District Court 
for the District of Utah and resident judges for the Tenth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. (NOTE: U.S. District Judge Paul 
Cassell is a recognized crimnal and consitutional law scholar 
who argued cases before the United States Supreme Court 
before becoming a federal judge and who continues to teach at 
the S.J. Quinney College of Law.  Bahrain\'s Minister of 
Justice knows Judge Cassel.  U.S. Appeals Court Justice Mike 
McConnell is also a highly respected, published, 
constitutional law scholar.  He has also argued numerous 
cases before the United States Supreme Court before taking 
the bench and also continues to teach.  END NOTE).  The 
resident program would combine academic work at the 
University of Utah with practical instruction and actual 
practice woven together at the United States Attorneys Office 
in Salt Lake City and at the United States District Court in 
Salt Lake City.  We also recommend that the participants 
return to Bahrain via Washington, DC.  This would provide an 
opportunity for meetings with appropriate senior USG 
officials of the executive and judicial branches. 
7.(U) The objectives of the resident program in the United 
States should be to increase the visitors\' awareness of the 
law and practical issues in the areas we have identified as 
needs.  The program should help the visitors become better at 
identifying and managing issues in theory and practice.  It 
should also provide selected skills training, that is, give 
the visitors a chance under controlled and non-threatening 
circumstances to observe and practice the skills that make 
for an effective criminal justice system.  In particular we 
want them to learn to use the features of the international 
terrorism conventions, standard concepts for fighting 
inchoate crime as it applies to counter terrorism 
investigations and prosecutions.  Done properly, the resident 
program will produce Bahraini professionals, including 
academics, who can use their experience when they return to 
Bahrain to teach and instruct others. 
 
8.(U) The resident program should be followed by a regular 
schedule of academic and professional exchanges conducted in 
Bahrain and in the United States aimed at maintaining the 
relationships that are formed through the first academic 
exchange and the resident program. 
 
9.(U) Phase I Cost Estimate 
 
Business Class Travel for four from Salt Lake City to Bahrain 
to Salt Lake City -- USD 37,768 
 
Per Diem in Bahrain for four for 8 days - USD 8480 
 
Materials Preparation - USD 5000 
 
Incidental Expenses - USD 1000 
 
Phase I Subtotal - USD 52,248 
 
Phase II Cost Estimate 
 
Tourist Class Travel for 10 Bahrainis from Bahrain - Salt 
Lake City - Washington, DC - Bahrain -- USD 18,980 
 
Per Diem for 10 Bahrainis to stay in Salt Lake City for 4 
weeks - 
USD 33,320 
 
Conference Coordination - USD 4000 
 
Materials - USD 5000 
 
Facility Rental - USD 1000 
 
Phase II Subtotal - USD 62,300 
 
Project Total - USD 114,548 
 
Post believes that the GOB might be persuaded to bear some of 
the financial burden for Phase II.  We would be willing to 
approach the Justice Ministry to provide perdiem for 
participants while INL funding would pay for the air fare. 
 
10.(U) ACTION REQUEST:  The details of this training/exchange 
plan were prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney David 
Schwendiman after his April visit to Bahrain with Justice 
Department Special Counsel Jim Reynolds. Post would be happy 
to forward the complete project proposal by e-mail to the 
appropriate INL action officer.  The Embassy requests that 
INL fund Phases I and II of this program.  END ACTION REQUEST.

ECONOMIC SITUATION:  SUMMARY 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronalt E. Neumann.  Reasons 1.4 (B)(D). 
 
This cable contains the summary of my parting reflections on 
Bahrain. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) Not yet democratic, its stability potentially 
challenged by a rejectionist Shia opposition, unemployment 
and cultural backlash, Bahrain has yet managed significant 
advances in political freedom and economic liberalization in 
the nearly three years of my tour.  Its already complex 
political geography of different agendas between King, PM, 
parliament, and constitutional rejectionists has been further 
complicated by the growth of conservative Sunnis with a 
radical fringe. 
 
2.  (S)  King Hamad is the fulcrum.  He transformed the 
nature of the political debate.  I believe he will allow 
further change, but the pace will be slower than in 2000-2002 
and he will insist it come through the parliament.  Thus the 
rejectionist opposition will not achieve through 
extra-parliamentary dialogue the fundamental reordering of 
power they seek.  Lacking the resources to force change, the 
opposition continues seeking controversies with some looking 
for a violent reaction that would rally their Shia base. 
Hamad has dodged this sectarian confrontation, but has had to 
sacrifice some law and order to do so.  He may have decided 
to use Shia policemen to restore credibility, and take an 
issue from the rejectionists . A struggle will go on at least 
until the 2006 election when the opposition will face the 
stark choice of participating or splitting.  Some violence is 
possible. 
 
3. (S) We have the right mix of policies; supporting 
participants in political evolution with patience and MEPI 
programs and encouraging rejectionists to participate while 
not accepting their claims that they are the only democrats. 
Our programs in law reform and education are part of building 
a civic society, but it is important to remember that this is 
still a fragile situation with few democratic habits where 
unemployment, political shocks from outside -- including 
deeply resented American policies -- could empower the 
opposition and set back the evolutionary pace.  In this mix 
our support for job creation through the FTA and economic 
reform remains essential  The result will be felt in the rest 
of the Gulf. Our resources have been significantly increased 
to meet our new tasks.  It is essential that we maintain the 
support necessary for our mission.  End Summary.

SUBJECT: PART II: PARTING THOUGHTS ON BAHRAIN\'S POLITICAL 
AND ECONOMIC SITUATION 
 
REF: MANAMA 863 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann.  Reasons 1.4 (B)(D). 
 
This is part II of my parting reflections on Bahrain. 
Reftel, Part I is the summary. 
 
--------- 
Political 
--------- 
 
1.  (S) Bahraini politics remain a complicated balancing act 
in a small polity.  By no means is it a full democracy, but 
it is going in the right direction with parliament making 
real trouble and forcing real changes.  If not always wise in 
their actions, the deputies can scarcely be discounted as 
non-entities. They are slowly developing new habits of 
dialogue across sectarian lines. 
 
2.  (S) The second chamber, the consultative council, has 
proved that it is more than a rubber stamp for the government 
as was predicted.  It has established its own progressive 
agenda.  A core of 10-15 members with professional and 
governmental experience has provided balance to the 
inexperienced and sometimes emotional deputies.  The 
consultative chamber has also developed common ties with the 
deputies, which were not predicted. 
 
3.  (S) I believe increasingly that the two-house structure 
was wise.  It prevents a zero-sum game developing between the 
parliament and the government.  This will be all the more 
necessary should the Shia opposition enter the next election 
where they would win a significant number of seats. 
 
4.  (S) However, it is not certain that the four-party, 
largely Shia rejectionist opposition will choose to enter 
those elections.  At this point, I think they will boycott. 
Despite extensive criticism -- above all from the Shia elite 
-- for having missed a significant opportunity through the 
last boycott, the rejectionists remain obdurate.  While they 
frame their stance on legal and constitutional arguments, I 
think they are really rejecting democratic participation in a 
bid for immediate political power.  There is no doubt that 
they have chosen to fight on the ground on which they are 
least likely to win; the monarchy has everything to lose from 
the ultimate concession that the opposition seeks. 
 
5.  (S) In rejecting participation, Al-Wifaq and its allies 
have forfeited potential political gains they might have 
achieved from leading parliament.  The rejectionists are left 
with a thus far sterile strategy of mobilizing their youthful 
and unemployed political base to force confrontation in hopes 
that it will rally the broader community support it enjoyed 
during the 90s\' uprising.  Confrontation has fostered a 
bargaining game that could develop momentum towards the 
informal dialogue democracies need to reach compromise.  As 
of now, the game is sterile because obtaining justice is more 
important to the rejectionists than achieving practical 
political goals.  The absence of an off-line discussion 
continues to bedevil the development of participatory 
politics. 
 
6.  Meanwhile, Shia have broken with Al-Wifaq and voted. 
Shia deputies in parliament will fight for their seats. 
Others are likely to break with Al-Wifaq if it again 
boycotts.  These strains could cause intra-Shia violence in 
2006. 
 
-------- 
The King 
-------- 
 
7.  (S) The king has been too adroit to give the 
rejectionists the crackdown that they want.  Political reform 
and modest economic growth have created incentives to avoid 
confrontation.  When confrontations occur, the king has 
authorized only enough force to maintain essential order. 
Violators are frequently pardoned.  When I asked him, the 
king admitted that he intends to avoid confrontation through 
the next election. 
 
8. (S) The price for this is increased lawlessness among 
young people. Petty crime and attacks on the south Asian 
community have risen.  Although not alarming, this is making 
the business community uneasy.  The appointment as interior 
minister of the king\'s close confidante and former BDF chief 
of staff could herald a new effort at law and order.  If so, 
it will come along with recruitment of new Shia police 
recruits.  I would hazard a guess that these new recruits 
will lead any aggressive law and order campaign in the Shia 
villages.  The crown prince told me that when the GOB decides 
to enforce the law, it wants the community behind the police. 
 
9. (S) Overall, King Hamad remains a skillful, intuitive 
political leader with  enormous confidence in his own 
judgment.  His close friends tell me that he has a strong 
belief in his own tie to the Bahraini people.  The king is 
sometimes impetuous, but he is prepared to change course 
rapidly if he finds himself in a box.  He has gained enough 
goodwill from his early reforms that he can ride out a good 
deal of criticism, although it is true that the pace of the 
early reforms led many to expect much more rapid change in 
succeeding years. I think we will not see that pace again. 
The king believes that a significant period is going to be 
needed for the evolution of political habits in Bahrain. 
 
10. (S) He has a long-term vision of equalizing power between 
Sunni and Shia communities while ruling as the arbitrator 
between them; ultimate power will remain his.  Yet, I believe 
Hamad is prepared to devolve more power to the parliament. 
He has told me that he would approve a political party law 
and has even encouraged some deputies to draft one.  He has 
not lifted a finger to protect ministers who were under 
attack, perhaps even seeing this as a way of undercutting his 
uncle the Prime Minister.  He has allowed the parliament to 
gradually force changes in pensions, social security, and 
probably in press and labor laws, although these are still 
being debated. 
 
11. (S) The king will not cause a major rupture in the family 
by removing his uncle the Prime Minister.  I believe that 
Hamad views such a family rift as both politically unwise and 
perhaps unmannerly.  But he is speedily undercutting his 
uncle in significant ways.  The tendering board has limited 
corruption.  The former housing ministry has passed to a 
clean minister.  The latest move in interior removes one of 
the last old guard of the PM and moves the position into 
Hamad\'s orbit.  The movement is much too slow for many, but 
after watching it for nearly three years, it is clear that 
the power will continue to pass steadily, if somewhat 
jerkily, to the king and his son Crown Prince Salman.  With 
power will come more political liberalization and economic 
reform. 
 
12.  (S) Hamad\'s weakness is that he has no detail men around 
him.  In fact he is not interested in detail.  His preference 
is to, as he says, \"find the right man and let him work the 
details.\"  The drawback is that the right man must often wait 
a long time until the wrong man is removed.  I suspect few 
tell the king bad news but he knows this; I never found him 
closing his ears so long as I told him hard truths politely 
and in private. 
 
---------------- 
The Crown Prince 
---------------- 
 
13. (S)  Crown Prince Salman remains his father\'s right-hand 
man in economic reform.  He lost some prestige last year when 
his well-known preference for a deeper cabinet reshuffle was 
beaten back by his uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa.  Salman has 
retrenched by focusing on economic areas where he can win. 
He seems to be injecting himself more into security and 
intelligence matters.  If this develops it will strengthen 
his base.  He remains extremely popular among both Shia and 
Sunni Bahrainis.  For some time the crown prince will be 
careful and will remain limited in the changes he can produce 
on his own.  He has said he will not be prime minister and 
wants this role eventually to pass out of the royal family. 
However, that may take some years. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa bin Isa 
------------------------------------- 
 
14.  (S)  Despite real political losses, Shaikh Khalifa 
remains powerful because he and his team have the experience 
and knowledge to manage the day-to-day details running the 
government.  I believe that Shaikh Khalifa is not wholly a 
negative influence.  While certainly corrupt he has built 
much of modern Bahrain.  He is dedicated to Bahrain. But he 
is a traditional Arab.  His preference for old ways and old 
ministers will remain a drag on the pace of reform. 
 
----------------------------------- 
A Society Growing More Conservative 
----------------------------------- 
15.  (S)  During my time on the island, Sunni and Shia alike 
have grown more socially conservative.  At the first 
university graduation I attended perhaps 60 percent of the 
women had head coverings; the last was in excess of 95 
percent.  The reasons for this are many, from backlash 
against the dislocation of globalization to resentment of 
drunken Saudis in the streets on the weekend.  The 
constituency of the Islamists is growing, increasing the 
political strength of the more radical fringe elements.  Some 
areas, like opposition to alcohol or risque public singers, 
reverberate across the Sunni/Shia divide.  In other ways a 
growing, but still small, radical Sunni presence intensified 
the differences.  Thus far, the government has approached the 
Islamist current timidly.  That strategy won\'t work forever. 
My guess is that the king will follow the same path he has 
with the Shia; letting the excesses build up social 
irritation on which he can finally move with public support. 
 
16.  (S)  Beyond a particular security dimension that 
concerns us, the Islamists are primarily a challenge to the 
future character of Bahrain.  The businessmen, intellectuals, 
social liberals and others who want a freer society in the 
future are beginning to think about how to resist 
conservative pressures.  They have not yet coalesced. But 
they are talking about action where last year they ran from 
politics.  In this, Bahrain is a small representative of a 
social struggle throughout the Arab world.

---------------------------------------- 
 
17.  (S)  Bahrain is vulnerable to tensions from the outside. 
 The Khobar shooting was 35 miles from Manama.  The king, 
prime minister and crown prince are unified in their 
determination to preserve the U.S. alliance as the 
cornerstone of Bahrain\'s external security.  They know this 
increases their vulnerability to criticism from pan Arab 
sentiments and ever-growing resentment of our Palestinian 
policies.  They, and particularly King Hamad, have elected to 
take a more public stance in support of key U.S. policies 
than is the norm for Arab leaders, betting that this will 
strengthen our ties.  They deeply believe we should do more 
to rebalance our Palestinian policies, but they recognize 
Bahrain lacks the leverage to induce us to change. 
 
18.  (S) Whether by government management or popular 
understanding, we have been fortunate that Bahrain\'s security 
relationship with us has not been a major focus of public 
concern.  Demonstrations about U.S. policy have focused on 
the Embassy and not on the naval base.  Since we are not 
quite sure why this is we are limited in our ability to 
forecast what political events might trigger public strains. 
Ultimately the alliance works because the GOB wants it and 
the king and royal family will defend the relationship.  But 
as liberalization continues we have to be more and more 
sensitive to the need to measure carefully actions that might 
trigger public attacks on the security relationship. Pushing 
an ICC exclusion (Article 98) in the face of Abu Ghraib is 
symptomatic of ignoring our problem. 
 
----------- 
The Economy 
----------- 
 
19.  (S) Economic problems massively underpin political 
instability.  The economy has advanced with both budget 
surpluses and growing jobs, but unemployment, concentrated 
particularly in the Shia ranks and a growing youth bulge 
remain.  With few natural resources, stagnant oil production, 
and an expanding population, Bahrain is paying the price for 
having structured an economy based on low wage, south Asian 
labor rather than high productivity, better paid Bahrainis. 
Economic reforms, which we support strongly, are, at best, 
only a portion of what is needed to break out of this 
misdirected model.  Powerful members of the business 
community and royal family have vested interest in the 
current system.  Raising the productivity level of young 
Bahrainis to make economically feasible paying a living wage 
is also a long-term project.  Until Bahrain makes headway 
with these intractable issues, unemployment will fuel the 
discontent of the opposition. 
 
20.  (S) There is a growing divide between the very wealthy 
and the very poor.  This feeds the sense of frustration and 
grievance.  Until the economy improves there is the risk that 
the frustrations will move either back into demonstrations in 
the street or into political challenges through the 
parliament that may not be containable by the methods used so 
far. 
 
21.  (S) King Hamad knows this and it is driving a number of 
economic decisions.  The crown prince\'s court is engaged in 
an intensive effort with labor and business to identify a way 
forward.  Paradoxically, the troubles in Saudi Arabia may 
lead to some increase in regional service business or the 
dependence of those engaged in such business moving from the 
eastern province to Bahrain.  By the same token, a terrorist 
incident in Bahrain or rapid departure of the foreign 
community could seriously imperil this state\'s security. 
 
--------------------------------- 
What It All Means for U.S. Policy 
--------------------------------- 
22.  (S)  Basically, we are on the right track.  We continue 
to publicize legitimate grievances by means of actions 
ranging from the human rights report to periodic quiet 
conversations that I\'ve had with the most senior leadership 
to keep them moving forward with reform.  We are continually 
telling the opposition that we will not save them from their 
own stupidities and urging them to get in the game.  This 
will all come into fresh focus in the next election.  Until 
then, NDI, as the chosen vehicle of U.S. support for 
democracy, has done a magnificent job in keeping doors open 
across the political spectrum and working to develop improved 
habits and practices of democracy.  We must continue to fund 
those efforts lavishly. 
 
23.  (S)  We continue to see that many of the habits of 
democratic practice are not established.  Compromise is not 
an immediate virtue.  The Arab propensity to look for justice 
may even be in opposition to the \"half a loaf\" notion of 
democratic compromise.  Civic society is weak.  There is no 
habit of going to the courts to settle political issues.  We 
are working on all of these fronts with our quiet MEPI-funded 
programs for strengthening judicial reform, civic education, 
and civic society.  In doing so we have to be careful not to 
become our own worst enemy.  The American imprimatur is not 
welcome in vast portions of the Arab world, including 
Bahrain.  Our desire to take credit and to put a U.S. label 
on programs will often be antithetical to their success.  But 
success in building stability and democratic habits are our 
real objectives.  We have to keep that in focus when are 
tempted to take short-term public credit. 
 
24.  (S)  Bahrain is far from perfect, but it is one of the 
best examples in the Arab world of economic reform.  If other 
societies are going to be encouraged to pay the politically 
painful prices of similar reforms, they need to see success 
for reform in Bahrain.  By signing the FTA and validating 
Bahrain\'s direction, we have made it in our interest as well 
as Bahrain\'s to seek investment and job growth.  Recognizing 
that we cannot order the private sector to invest, we must 
nevertheless do everything in our power in the next year to 
encourage effective, focused business dialogues on both 
sides.  Absent the need to support another war, I believe 
this will be the leading bilateral policy challenge of the 
immediate future. 
 
25.  (S) Every program suffers to some extent from being 
executed in a hostile, public climate.  I believe we have 
done as much or more than any mission our size in fighting 
the media battle from placements to interviews by senior 
embassy staff, to the use of speakers.  I am sure this 
tradition will continue, but until the media climate changes, 
every other program, outside perhaps the security and 
military fields, will operate with a drag.  Fundamentally 
this is a difference over policy not packaging.  To the 
extent that packaging can help, it is speakers, personal 
contacts and two-way visits that preserve the fragments of 
dialogue and mutual understanding that exist.  My own belief 
from three years in this media climate is that every dollar 
of face-to-face contact is worth one hundred spent in the 
electronic media that is either ignored or almost 
instantaneously rejected. 
 
26.  (S)  Despite the difference and the hostile media 
climate we have come a long way in an already excellent 
relationship with Bahrain.  We have excellent people, both 
American and local staff.  They are dedicated, working often 
long hours and sometimes at risk.  We have stretched them 
terribly with the demands of two wars and support for Iraq. 
These are issues far larger than this small post, but it will 
be important that this post, like many others, continue to 
receive the expanding support that it has gotten over the 
last three years.  Our interests are growing and we must not 
return to the contracting resource policies of the past.

BAHRAIN\'S PRESS 
 
REF: MANAMA 831 
 
1.SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  Bahraini Arabic newspapers reported 
that participants at human rights conference roundly 
criticized U.S. article 98 agreements.  Fortunately, 
participants did not discuss the U.S.-Bahrain Article 98 
agreement.  This negative press reinforces our view that 
obtaining parliamentary approval for Article 98 entry into 
force would be next to impossible at this time.  END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT. 
 
2. The June 5 edition of the semi-governmental Arabic daily 
\"al-Ayam\" carried a story about a regional human rights 
conference on the ratification and implementation of the 
International Criminal Court Treaty.  The seminar was 
sponsored by the Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), the 
International Federation for Human Rights (IFHR - possibly a 
French NGO), and Bahrain\'s Ministry of Justice.  Featured 
speakers included the Undersecretary of the Ministry of 
Justice, Shaikh Khalid bin Ali Al-Khalifa, BHRS President 
Sabika Najjar, and an unnamed IFHR representative. 
 
3. The journalist who wrote the story told POLFSN that a 
Yemeni participant intervened during the discussions to 
stress the important of rejecting the ratification of any 
bilateral treaty with the U.S. that protects its soldiers and 
citizens from the jurisdiction of the ICC.  Participants from 
Egypt and Jordan juxtaposed the EU\'s lack of concern with the 
supreme judicial authority granted in the treaty to the ICC 
with U.S. efforts to escape international accountability by 
signing such bilateral agreements.  A Bahraini member of the 
Bahrain Society for Human Rights, a GOB-endorsed NGO, sought 
clarification on the extent of protections a bilateral 
agreement might provide to American citizens.  He also 
questioned whether bilateral treaties grant any American 
immunity from ICC prosecution if they commit crimes in 
countries that are parties to the ICC convention.

SUBJECT: GOB FORGES AHEAD TO HELP FTA DREAM BECOME A 
BUSINESS REALITY 
 
1. SUMMARY: Bahrain\'s government and business community are 
actively pursuing ways to make the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
with the United States become a powerhouse for the economy, 
as responsibility begins to shift from the givernment to the 
private sector.  Seeking to strengthen commercial ties with 
the United States, whether through support of an AmCham in 
Bahrain or by sending to and receiving from the United States 
business delegations, the GoB is in strong support of 
business objectives.  The business community, too, is 
beginning to look outside its borders to benefit from the 
Jordanian FTA experience, to learn from it and to replicate 
its success.  Interministerial and government to business 
dialog are boosting Bahraini business confidence that FTA is 
a good thing that can work for them if they decide to take 
responsibility for its success.   END SUMMARY 
 
------------ 
COMMERCE MINISTER PLEDGES PARTNERSHIP WITH CHARGE 
-------------- 
 
2. In his initial meeting with CDA on June 16, Commerce 
Minister Ali Saleh Al Saleh noted that we have much work 
ahead to make the dream of the \"era of FTA\" a reality for 
business.   The Commerce ministry, he stressed, will exert 
every effort to help the private sector achieve success. 
Saleh said that he wants to see Bahrain become a model for 
the region and the economic envy of its neighbors.  Making 
Bahrain the regional base for American companies and 
investors, he emphasized, is one way to accomplish this goal. 
 The Minister agreed with the CDA regarding the importance of 
establishing an American Chamber of Commerce as a mechanism 
for U.S. business to learn about Bahrain and to penetrate the 
region.  To strengthen an AMCHAM Bahrain\'s chances for 
success, the Minister noted that he had facilitated an 
unprecedented cabinet decision to authorize registration of 
the AMCHAM with the Ministry of Commerce rather than the 
Ministry of Labor. 
 
3. Minister Saleh noted that the office of Assistant 
Undersecretary of Foreign Trade Relations Shaikh Daij Al 
Khalifa is charged with creating a post-FTA five year plan 
for the Ministry of Commerce to help Bahrain capitalize on 
the FTA.  Shaikh Daij added that the GOB made public in a 
June 15 press conference that it would establish permanent 
contact with the private sector on FTA.  Further, an 
interministerial committee under Ministry of Finance 
leadership is creating an action plan to follow up on FTA 
implementation. 
 
4. The Minister noted that he had reserved E-commerce and 
entrepreneurship as the Commerce Ministry\'s areas of 
responsibility for post-FTA promotion.  He highlighted that 
Microsoft has joined with the GOB to develop e-government and 
is working on a five year plan to boost the commercial IT 
sector, but Saleh said he would like to see more assistance 
and cooperation in this arena.  Further, working together 
with the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and in the 
future hopefully with AmCham membership as well, the Minister 
envisions young people creating companies, not just jobs. 
Capitalizing on U.S. entrepreneurial spirit and expertise, 
the Minister hopes to send a specialized delegation to the 
United States to discover how to promote these issues and 
encourage these new developments. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
PRIME MINISTER MAKES FTA SUCCESS A PRIORITY 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. Upon his return to Bahrain, Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa 
bin Salman Al Khalifa publicly praised the FTA and urged 
Bahraini businesses to exert every effort to make the 
agreement a success.  Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry (BCCI) Chairman Khalid Kanoo told POL/ECON Chief on 
June 10 that the Prime Minister had reiterated his public 
message in a private meeting with the BCCI board of 
directors.  Kanoo pledged that BCCI would aggressively 
develop post-FTA business promotion. 
 
----------------------------------- 
BCCI LOOKS TO JORDAN FOR FTA ADVICE 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. BCCI invited Jordanian trade expert Rasim Samih Abdul 
Rahim to address the BCCI membership June 7 on methods for 
the private sector to benefit from the Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA) with the United States.  Abdul Rahim served as an 
advisor for the FTA Unit in the Support and Developing 
Business Environment program in Jordan. He is also working as 
an International Advisor to the International Trade 
Organization and UNCTAD and is a member of several 
specialized professional international associations.  Abdul 
Rahim noted that all countries have benefited from an FTA 
with the United States.  The agreement\'s effectiveness, he 
continued, will depend on how businesses take advantage of 
the agreement, which sets up a framework to develop 
investment opportunities between the two countries.  Like the 
FTA with Jordan, the economic goal of Bahrain\'s FTA with the 
US, he said, was to establish clear trade regulations to 
promote mutual trade and to encourage innovation.  This would 
strengthen friendly ties, improve the country,s economic 
relationship with the US, improve the standard of living in 
Bahrain, facilitate investment opportunities, and achieve 
sustainable development.  Abdul Rahim highlighted the 
exemption of custom duties on consumer products, and 
industrial, agriculture, and electronic goods, including the 
protection of intellectual property rights and labor rights 
along with commitments to protect the environment. 
 
7. Abdul Rahim stated that the US-Jordan FTA had produced a 
huge increase in Jordan,s exports to the US following the 
signing of the agreement.  To duplicate that outcome in 
Bahrain, Abdul Rahim stressed the responsibility of the 
business community in implementing the FTA.  The private 
sector, he noted, must examine the provisions of the 
agreement in order to facilitate access into the 
international market and to realize the best investment 
opportunities presented by the agreement.  Other countries\' 
experience could provide useful lessons.  He recommended that 
Bahrain\'s private sector establish a strong commercial 
presence in US markets.  Jordanian companies that had opened 
branches in the US had achieved much success.  Abdul Rahim 
highlighted the role of the Jordanian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry in studying anticipated commercial and investment 
opportunities. He called upon Bahrain\'s business community to 
strengthen their relationship with the Chamber of Commerce, 
and to participate in their efforts to inform citizens about 
business opportunities opened by the FTA.  He also stressed 
the importance of cooperation between the public and private 
sectors for identifying and exploiting new business 
relationships. 
 
8. BCCI Vice Chairman Chairman of the BCCI FTA Steering 
Committee Essam Fakhro commented that once the agreement is 
signed, responsibility for its success will be transferred 
from the government to the private sector.  Increased 
competition will bring new challenges to the private sector. 
Fakhro stressed that BCCI is conducting a comprehensive 
program conducted to inform Bahrain\'s business community of 
the opportunities the FTA presents. 
 
----------- 
COMMENT: 
--------- 
 
9. FTA negotiations have begun a remarkable development in 
Bahrain: Ministries have started coordinating and cooperating 
to achieve ends that are beneficial to Bahrain as a whole. 
The creation of an interministerial committee to follow up on 
FTA implementation would not have been possible as little as 
two years ago.  Further, the Government and business 
communities are talking frequently, and the Government is 
showing business its strong support. The business community 
is also beginning to look independently for ways to make the 
FTA work for them, and as a first step toward broadening this 
horizon, have opened up to the Jordanian business community, 
to profit from their experience. If Bahrain\'s business 
community continues on this trajectory and continues to 
receive the support and encourageent it clearly needs from 
government officials, they will make FTA a success for 
Bahrain.  END COMMENT

registered The American Chamber of Commerce in Bahrain as a 
non-profit company.  That evening, the Minister announced the 
registration at an AMCHAM membership dinner sponsored by 
Microsoft and American Express.  Approximately 60 high-level 
U.S. business representatives along with government officials 
and journalists heard the Commerce Minister and Charge\' note 
that the creation of an AMCHAM in Bahrain is a vital step for 
promoting bilateral trade and making the FTA a success.  The 
AMCHAM formation committee reported an enthusiastic response 
to the membership drive.  The committee hopes to hold a

SUBJECT: RETURNED IV PARTICIPANT IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: In the midst of anti-American sentiments in 
some segments of Bahraini society, Yousif Mohammed 
Mahmoud, a participant in an April 2004 International 
Visitor (IV) program, gave the U.S. a much-needed 
positive press spin this week.  Mr. Mahmoud reflected to 
the local press on his International Visitor experience 
and extolled American accomplishments in museum 
management, while also highlighting the value of these 
accomplishments to Bahrain.  The articles demonstrated 
the potential influence that visits to the U.S. could 
have on participants and their home societies. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. On June 20, a half-page article in the Gulf Daily News 
entitled \"Official\'s US Visit Builds Cultural Bridges\" 
focused on the experience of International Visitor (IV) 
Mr. Yousif Mohammed Mahmoud. Mr. Mahmoud is the Director 
of the Bahrain Contemporary Art Association and was the 
only Arab participant in the \"Role of Museums in American 
Society\" IV in April 2004.  In the article, he asserted 
that American communities are keen to present their 
heritage and culture to the world and that Bahrain, as a 
whole, can benefit from this experience. He emphasized 
that following the example of the USG\'s support for 
cultural preservation would be a step in the right 
direction for Bahrain.  A similar article was published 
two weeks ago in the Bahrain Tribune. 
 
----------------------- 
IVs Make a Difference 
----------------------- 
 
3. Since returning from his visit to the U.S., Mr. 
Mahmoud has been active in fostering the U.S./Bahraini 
relationship. In a report written by Mr. Mahmoud to post 
about his IV experience he asserts, \"I am ready to work 
with you on any program or activities that help to 
promote our relation for better understanding.\" He 
reported to journalists that in the spring of 2005 he is 
planning to organize a visual art exhibition of American 
artists and their Bahraini counterparts. As part of the 
project, he will use his newfound network of colleagues, 
developed during his trip in the U.S., to nominate 
participant artists. 
 
4. COMMENT:  This article demonstrates the long-term 
influence that visits to the U.S. can have on IV 
participants and their home societies.  As Mahmoud 
states, \"The impact of this visit on me was completely 
different from what I had expected as an Arab visitor 
after 9/11.  The American people were so friendly and 
agreed that we should not judge Islam on the basis of 
individual fundamentalist activities.\" Post will continue 
to stay in close touch with Mr. Mahmoud and our other IV 
returnees.  END COMMENT.

1.(S) SUMMARY: Explaining he has no role in prosecutorial 
decisions, the Justice Minister advised the Charge that 
Bahrain\'s Attorney General will decide whether to pursue a 
more thorough investigation or release the seven Bahrainis 
arrested on June 22 on suspicion of conspiring to perform 
terrorist acts.  The police have 48 hours to conduct a 
preliminary investigation and present the case to the 
Attorney General.  If a trial judge agrees, the suspects 
could be detained for as long as six months at which time the 
GOB must either prosecute them or release them.  The Minister 
predicted that political pressure could mount to release the 
suspects.  June 23 newspapers indicate that pressure has 
already begun.  The USG should relentlessly counter this 
pressure with a message that the suspects should be detained 
for the maximum allowable time to conduct a thorough 
investigation and to bring them to trial.  We should also 
counsel the Bahrainis to insure that the defendants receive 
full due process rights guaranteed in Bahrain\'s constitution. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(S) Responding to Charge\'s question about the probability 
of prosecuting the seven Bahrainis arrested on June 22 under 
suspicion of consiracy to commit terrorist acts, Justice 
Minister Jawad al Arayed said that the police have 48 hours 
to conduct a preliminary investigation and hand the case over 
to the Attorney General with intent to develop a case to 
prosecute or release the suspects.  The clock, he indicated, 
began ticking on the night of June 22.  The investigating 
prosecutor assigned to the case would then have 45 days to 
expand the investigation, he continued.  At the conclusion of 
that period, the prosecutor can either bring the case to 
trial, or seek an additional 45 days from a trial judge to 
continue the investigation, the minister said.  If a trial 
judge agrees, al Arayed confirmed, a prosecutor could detain 
a suspect for a maximum of six months, after which he must 
either release the suspect or bring the case to trial. 
 
3.(S) Emphasizing prosecutorial independence, the Minister 
stated explicitly that he has no role in the prosecution 
decision.  The investigating prosecutor will decide whether 
to release the suspects or take the case to court.  However, 
the Minister noted that Bahrain\'s justice system is going 
through a transition process and many of the new prosecutors 
have only elementary training.  None of them have much 
knowledge or experience in handling a sophisticated 
investigation of this type, he said. 
 
4.(S) Commenting on the arrests, the Minister admitted that 
the GOB is aware that these seven individuals are bad guys, 
especially Bukhowa, who is a sophisticated gangster.  They 
are ruthless people who are part of a global movement.  We 
will have to deal with this issue and these people 
repeatedly, he commented.  Some of them, the Minister 
continued, were arrested before, and released.  Al Arayed 
straightforwardly commented that political pressure, along 
with public pressure from human rights groups, would build 
and could affect decision-making. 
 
5.(U)  Local newspaper coverage of the arrests extensively 
cited Shaikh Muhammad Salih Muhammad, who was quoted as 
claiming that he negotiated a deal with the government to 
remain in house arrest rather than experience jail detention. 
 The press also quoted MP Shaikh Muhammad Khalid and defense 
lawyer Abdullah Hashim\'s protestations of the innocence of 
the seven and their complaints about lack of attorney access 
to the detainees.  The articles quoted the wife of Yasir 
Kamal complaining about the behavior of the police who 
entered her house to arrest her husband, and photos in the 
papers showed Kamal\'s house in disarray.  On the other hand, 
the pro-government Arabic daily \"al-Ayyam\" ran a front page 
editorial endorsing government efforts to prevent security 
threats and to reinforce stability. 
 
6.(C) UK Ambassador Lamb called advised Charge on June 22 
that one of the detained individuals is a UK dual national. 
Lamb stated that he has no choice but to provide consular 
services and expressed his hope that the USG would understand 
his situation. 
 
7.(S) COMMENT:  In meetings leading up to the arrests, Crown 
Prince Shaikh Salman, Minister of State Abd al-Nabi 
al-Shoala, and Minister of Cabinet Affairs al-Muttawa told 
Charge that they recognized the problem and promised action. 
The next two days will test Bahrain\'s commitment to prevent 
terrorism.  Political pressure to effect their release has 
already begun.    At this point, a decision to detain the 
suspects to pursue an investigation would send a strong 
signal.  Eventually prosecuting them would strengthen the 
message.  Equally important, ensuring the defendants receive 
due process protections would sustain Bahrain\'s image on 
political reform and also refute international human rights 
organizations\' allegations that the Global War on Terror is 
eroding human rights gains in the region.  We will need to 
convey relentlessly our message that the GOB should 
aggressively pursue its investigation and prosecution these 
suspects while assiduously assuring they receive due process. 
 END COMMENT.

1.  Twenty Bahraini high school students and their 
families gathered at the American Cultural and Education 
Center (ACEC) on June 23 to receive Certificates of Award 
for the Micro Scholarship for English language study 
funded by R and administered by the post.  Charg

the importance of English language knowledge.  PAS

both Arabic and English dailies. 
 
2.  The students, who will begin their senior year in the 
fall, are part of a pilot program in which they will 
study English during the summer at ACEC. Post worked 
closely with the Ministry of Education to select the 
twenty students based on financial need and academic 
performance.  Prior to receiving the scholarships, these 
students would never have dreamed of participating in 
English language classes at ACEC. Although cheaper than 
its competitors, ACEC is still unaffordable for many 
Bahrainis.  For the majority of the scholarship 
recipients, and their families, this was the first time 
to visit ACEC and to have personal contact with a high- 
level American official. The father of a veiled female 
student exclaimed, \"the American Embassy is kind to 
reward my daughter\'s hard work. I am proud that she will 
have similar opportunities as other students.\" A 
recipient of the scholarship said, \"maybe one day I can 
visit America to practice the English that I will learn.\" 
 
3.  The scholarship recipients will participate in 
enrichment activities with American companies, the 
American Studies Center at the University of Bahrain, and 
at the Embassy, to practice their English skills.  After 
completing the initial summer pilot program, post plans 
to increase the program to fifty high school students 
during the 2004/2005 academic year.

the 6 extremist was characterized as a \"small item\" and we\'ve 
overcome worse before. Shaikh Rashid was firm about there 
being no evidence found during six or seven searches (the 
police originally reported 26 sites were searched) to keep 
the six men in jail. The Attorney General released the men 
based on due process, transparency and democracy. The 
Minister thought the arrests would be appreciated and 
commented that the attack planning phase had been disrupted 
or delayed. He stated the case is still being built and asked 
PMIL about what information had been found on the seized 
computer hard drives. He was uncertain why the government was 
being blamed for the quick release of the six extremists and 
caused the Travel Warning to be issued. 
 
4. (S/NF) He focused on getting past this event, looking to 
the future and working together. The extremists have given 
press conferences, been cheered by civic leaders and are 
recognized by Parliamentarians as heroes. The six men are 
seen as driving a wedge between the U.S. and Bahrain. The 
Government of Bahrain wants to put this event behind them, 
move toward the future and develop the closest level of 
cooperation on security and counter-terrorism issues. The 
Minister asked for two MOUs: 1) top secret access to 
documents (these documents are shared with a few Bahrain 
National Security Agency personnel at this time), and 2) 
provide U.S. assistance to develop a Counter-Terrorism 
Operations Center to improve intelligence and law enforcement 
capabilities. 
 
- - - - - - - - - 
THE CHARGE\'S TURN 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
5. (S/NF) CDA Williamson replied that the arrest of the 
extremists is not a \"gift\" to the U.S. nor is their rapid 
release about \"democracy.\" The issue is Bahraini national 
security, and what steps the GOB is prepared to take in its 
own interest. The previous 50 years of friendship, MNNA, FTA 
and ATA are now being looked at differently by the U.S. as a 
result of the GOB releasing the known extremists. The Navy 
base is sending its dependents back to the US. The Embassy is 
being pressured by the Department to justify why its 
dependents are not leaving also. It becomes difficult to 
encourage trade and advance programs when Embassy staff and 
families may depart Bahrain. Several defense contractors and 
businesses have ordered their people back to the US or will 
relocate their personnel to Dubai. 
 
6. (S/NF) The U.S. applauds the GOB efforts to apprehend the 
men, but confidence in the GOB plummeted when they were 
released 43 hours later. This sends a message to the U.S. 
that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations can operate 
in Bahrain without severe penalties. The only cost to the 
extremists is to worry about being arrested every few months 
and then spend less than a weekend in jail. There is almost 
no penalty for terrorists planning to attack Americans in 
Bahrain. The public stature of the six has been elevated 
substantially with press interviews, meetings with civic 
leaders and support from  Parliamentarians. The extremists 
are now on the street and have continued planning operations. 
We know about these men but there may be other terrorist 
cells in Bahrain planning other attacks. The BNSA and MOI do 
not have the resources or training to know where they are at 
all times. They must be prevented from operating freely and 
communicating with their leadership and supporters.

Begin Text: 
 
Riffa Palace 
Kingdom of Bahrain 
Arabian Gulf 
4th July, 2004 
 
Dear Mr. Bush, 
 
On this 4th of July, the anniversary of American 
Independence, we want to reaffirm our belief that the 
strategic relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the 
Unites States, developed over one hundred years, cannot be 
affected by passing clouds of alarm caused by terrorist acts, 
acts that we have unconditionally denounced since between the 
attacks of 11 September 2001. 
 
We have stood together in the face of terrorism, and worked 
together hand-in-hand to uproot terrorists and cut off their 
resources, as a natural part of our historic coalition, and 
in order to safeguard the values and principles of the free 
world. 
 
Mr. President, 
We in the Kingdom of Bahrain are confident that our hands 
will remain joined with the people of the United States and 
with you personally, Mr. President, despite the planning for 
the temporary departure from our shores of some American 
families.  Nothing upsets me more than seeing some of our 
American friends feeling insecure amongst Bahrainis, and my 
wish is for them to stay, and to always remain part of our 
Bahraini family. 
 
The reality is that Bahrain has always been, and will remain, 
a place of security and tranquillity, and our national 
security and law enforcement agencies continue to work to 
combat terrorism and uproot terrorists, within our laws and 
Constitution. 
 
Experience has proved the value of the cooperative relations 
between our two friendly countries, since the time that the 
first American warship visited the Arabian Gulf after the 
Second world war, and berthed in a Bahraini port. We have 
also cooperated closely during the two Gulf conflicts, to the 
extent that you declared Bahrain a Major Non-NATO Ally of the 
United States.  In addition, your administration has also 
decided to sign a  Free trade Agreement with Bahrain. 
 
These developments were crowned by your invitation last month 
to meet with you in Sea Island, Georgia, during the G-8 
Summit, to work together towards a more secure and free world. 
 
Mr. President, 
Bahrain will maintain its historic positions, and will not 
change its stand alongside the United States. 
 
      During our meeting yesterday with officials of the 
Bahrain Defence Force, we declared our willingness to support 
Iraq by dispatching a maritime force from Bahrain to secure 
and maintain safe navigation in Iraqi territorial waters, if 
so requested by the new Iraqi government, as part of our 
joint efforts to build a new united and free Iraq. 
 
      Our commitment to maintain security and stability in 
the Gulf and the Middle East will continue in all 
circumstances, hand-in-hand with our friends and allies.  We 
will never allow the threats of the terrorists to derail us 
from this historic mission. 
 
      Finally we take this opportunity, on the occasion of 
American Independence Day, to express our best wishes and 
considerations to you and the friendly people of the United 
States of America. 
 
Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa 
King of Bahrain

REF: 03 MANAMA 2699 
 
1.  On July 10, Chairman of the Interministerial Committee on 
Anti-TIP activities, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Assistant 
Undersecretary Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa 
briefed P/E Chief and PolOff on the status of the remaining 
items from the GOB 2003 Action Plan. 
 
 - VICTIM ABUSE SHELTER - Shaikh Abdul Aziz was pleased to 
report that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs have established a victim assistance 
shelter in Hidd on the eastern coast of Bahrain.  Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz invited PolOff to accompany him on a site visit. 
 
 - OPERATIONAL HOTLINE - PolOff informed Shaikh Abdul Aziz 
that MEPI approved a small grant to train both the MOLSA 
hotline telephone operators and the Bahrain Centre for Human 
Rights Migrant Workers Group volunteers.  \"Now that we have 
the money and a contractor, we need to set dates,\" she said. 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz said he would discuss Fall scheduling for 
the training seminar with MOLSA Director of Labor Relations 
Ali bin Abdulrahman Al Khalifa. 
 
 - PUBLIC AWARENESS PLAN BY THE MUNICIPALITIES - Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz reported that only the Manama Central Governate 
announced plans to launch a anti-TIP public awareness 
campaign.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz indicated that he would look at 
renewing public awareness activities. 
 
 - INVESTIGATION, PREVENTION AND PROSECUTION - Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz was pleased to report that the MOLSA Director of Labor 
Relations Shaikh Ali has stepped up labor inspections to 
crack down on manpower agencies involved in human 
trafficking.  In a July 7 Gulf Daily News article, MOLSA 
cited that three inspectors have been designated to look into 
complaints about malpracticing manpower agencies.  There are 
currently 82 licensed manpower agencies and that in the past 
two years 63 agencies have been shut down. Shaikh Ali 
reported to PolOff on June 14 that he is working directly 
with the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights Migrant Workers 
Group on investigating housemaid abuse cases. He also said 
that MOLSA plans to hire more labor, safety and tourism 
inspectors and increase spot inspections.  Shaikh Ali has 
issued a press release on MOLSA\'s campaign to crack down on 
\"free visa\" violators. 
 
 - CRIMINALIZE TRAFFICKING - P/E Chief inquired whether 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz had succeeded in inserting a provision to 
criminalize trafficking into the draft labor law.   P/E Chief 
also asked if the GOB labor law negotiators are looking at 
insuring that the labor law protects household workers. 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz admitted that the labor law is in its 
infancy and would ask the MFA\'s Director of Legal Affairs to 
check the draft to see if it included provisions like these. 
 
----------------------------------- 
POSSIBLE ITEMS FOR 2004 ACTION PLAN 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. Shaikh Abdul Aziz told Emboffs that he plans to convene 
the inter-ministerial task force this month to discuss 
anti-TIP activities planned for the upcoming year.  EmbOFFs 
presented  possible items to be included in a GOB 2004 action 
plan.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz thanked EmbOFFs for their 
suggestions and promised to put them before the task force. 
 
3.   PolOFF forwarded this list to Shaikh Abdul Aziz. 
 
 - Develop a comprehensive anti-trafficking law 
 - Bring domestic workers under the protection of its labor 
laws 
 - Encourage and foster participation of NGOs to fight 
trafficking 
 - Expedite labor dispute hearings 
 - Make mediation services widely available to victims 
 - Provide timely statistics on labor court decisions, 
prosecutions and complaints 
 - Prosecute employers that abuse or traffic victims and 
prevent them from securing additional work permits for 
foreign workers 
 - Participate in the approved IOM TIP project 
 - Schedule hotline operator training

1.  SUMMARY.  The Bahrain Women\'s Society (BWS) has emerged 
as a leader among Bahrain\'s NGOs.  Through its highly 
successful outreach programs BWS enables women to assume 
leading roles in society, and increase social awareness of 
issues relating to children, education and the environment. 
This group of Shi\'a women has developed a strategic plan to 
contribute to improving social development.  These agents of 
change are open to new ideas and welcome any initiatives that 
implement democratic reform.  On March 3 BWS leaders Drs. 
Wajeeha Al Baharna and Soroor Qarooni met with U/S Grossman 
(see ref b). END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
BAHRAIN WOMEN\'S SOCIETY 
----------------------- 
 
2.  In 2001, Dr. Wajeeha Sadiq Al Baharna established BWS and 
developed a strategic plan to touch different factions of 
society with unique and qualitative programs.  In three short 
years, the BWS has left a clear mark on Bahraini society, 
especially for women.  BWS\'s main goals are to enable women 
to assume a leading role in society, to achieve social 
justice, increase social awareness of issues relating to 
child abuse and neglect, consolidate a sense of environmental 
citizenship in individuals and society as a whole, and 
contribute to the drafting and improvement of laws relating 
to social development.  PD has close contact with BWS since 
its inception.  BWS welcomes financial support/grants from 
Embassy Manama.  BWS funded two board members to take English 
at ACEC to increase their level of fluency to engage in 
international conferences. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
SUPPORTING ABUSED WOMEN AND CHILDREN - BE FREE PROJECT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  Dr. Al Baharna told PolOff on March 13 that the society 
has made children a top priority.  Its &Be Free8 project 
focuses on protecting children from abuse and neglect. 
Project Director Dr. Soroor Qarooni solicited the Crown 
Prince,s wife Shaikha Hala bint Duaij Al Khalifa\'s 
involvement to launch the project on March 19, 2002.  The 
project is divided into three phases.  The first stage 
focuses on educating the child by identifying at-risk 
populations, building awareness about dangerous locales, 
teaching them how to identify suspects and what to do if 
someone attempts to abuse them.  The second stage involves 
teaching children basic daily practices to strengthen their 
character and increase their self-esteem.  The final stage is 
provision of continual support to victims by studying child 
legislation in the Kingdom and inaugurating the first of its 
kind in the Middle East - a &Be Free8 center.  In 
conjunction with the program\'s final phase, the Society 
established a hotline to field domestic abuse calls.  In 
December 2003, Post provided a small PD grant for NGO 
development of BWS board members and volunteers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
EMPOWERING WOMEN - BWS WOMEN\'S ADVANCEMENT PROJECT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  Dr. Baharna told PolFSN on April 16 that empowering women 
is a necessity of modern societies.  Al Baharna briefed 
PolFSN on BWS Women\'s Advancement Project that attempts to 
develop, employ, and invest in human capacity because women 
constitute 50 percent of Bahraini society.  Project Director 
Ibtisam Zaid launched the project in July 2003, laying down 
the goals of developing women,s self-esteem and increasing 
educational qualifications, awareness of women,s issues, 
legal awareness with respect to women\'s social role, 
awareness of the concept of gender roles. 
 
5.  BWS achieved its projects goals by holding seminars and 
conferences, disseminating a new culture for women through 
the society\'s publications and local press, cooperating with 
local governmental and non-governmental institutions to 
eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, and 
participating in local radio and television shows which 
address women,s issues. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
EDUCATIONAL REFORM - ENVIRONMENTAL CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  Al Baharna told EmbOffs on April 11 that previously she 
considered educational reform an impossible task, citing that 
the Ministry of Education does not have a mechanism for 
parental, teacher or concerned citizen input to the 
curriculum.  With rising unemployment and recognition that 
children are not learning the skills needed to compete in a 
future job market, BWS decided to take action and develop the 
Environmental Citizenship program.  Project Director Saba Al 
Asfoor developed an after-school activities program from 
children to learn more about the environment and science.  By 
taking an \"after-school\" approach, the Ministry of Education 
did not object.  The program was met with rave reviews from 
the teachers, children and parents.  BWS was unable to keep 
up with demand.  Dr. Baharna reported that now the Ministry 
of Education has invited BWS to partake in ministerial 
meetings on its science curriculum for the upcoming year. 
Lending to its credibility, BWS now sits on Bahrain\'s 
National Environmental Commission. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
EMPOWERING DISABLED CHILDREN - WHITE HAND PROJECT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7.  With the approval of the former Minister of Health Dr. 
Faisal Al Mousawi, Project Director Feryal Al Sairafi 
established the \"White Hand\" project in September 2002.  Not 
only does the project provide academic instruction to 
children who suffer from debilitating diseases and are 
usually confined to their beds, but it helps discover and 
enhance a child\'s other talents so they can remain active. 
BWS implemented this project in the pediatric wards of 
Bahrain\'s hospitals.  US Fulbright scholars have volunteered 
with White Hand. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM PARTICIPATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  Since 2002 Post nominated four BWS members to participate 
in the International Visitors Program (IVP).  In June 2002 
Dr. Baharna went on the Global Environmental Issues IVP. In 
February 2003 Dr. Qarooni participated in the IVP on 
Promoting Effective NGO Leadership for Women.  Both women 
have told PolOff that the opportunity to meet their 
counterparts and experience America first-hand was priceless. 
 Both came home to Bahrain inspired to delve into issues that 
appeared daunting in the past.  Saba Al Asfoor and Nadia Al 
Alawi went on leadership programs.  All board members have 
told PAO and EmbOffs that they rely on IVP contacts for 
advice, support and exchange of new ideas. Dr. Al Baharna now 
reaches out to international organizations without 
hesitation. Her experience has benefitted BWS greatly. 
 
9.  During a May 12 meeting with EmbOFFS, Dr. Al Baharna, 
expressed her desire to strengthen cooperation between the 
BWS and other women,s societies in the Kingdom.  She also 
encouraged governmental agencies to embark on this drive that 
is in keeping with the King,s reform process and will help 
establish a modern and democratic society.  At the May 12 
meeting EmbOffs introduced Drs. Al Baharna and Qarooni to 
President of the Textile Union, Kadija Attiya.  They offered 
Attiya BWS\' support in her campaign to save garment industry 
jobs that are held by conservative Shi\'a women (see ref a). 
Dr. Baharna told PolOff on June 8 that she is planning to 
present this issue to the Bahrain Women\'s Federation so she 
can involve as many women organizations as possible to help 
Attiya. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  The Bahrain Women\'s Society\'s membership 
totals approximately 50-65 women who genuinely care to 
improve the conditions of Bahraini women and children. 
Although the leadership dresses conservatively and wear 
hijabs (head scarves) they are agents of change - extremely 
open to new ideas and welcome any initiatives that would 
implement real democratic reforms in Bahrain.  On March 2003, 
Drs. Al Baharna and Qarooni met with U/S Grossman to make 
clear that even though human rights conditions have greatly 
improved, the GOB still needs to improve its record on 
discrimination, poverty and education and start taking NGOs 
seriously. (see ref b) Bahrain is fortunate to have the BWS.

SUBJECT: GOB RE-ARRESTS THE BAHRAINI SIX 
 
REF: WILLIAMSON/DIBBLE 07/15/04 EMAIL 
 
Classified By: BY CDA MOLLY K. WILLIAMSON FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. The GoB re-arrested the \"Bahraini Six\" yesterday afternoon 
on suspicion of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. The six 
were taken to the Public Prosecutor\'s Office and were 
transferred to Galali prison at approximately 2:00 a.m. this 
morning. Amal Ahmed Abdulla Abdul, Under Secretary of the 
Prosecution, confirmed to PolOff that they were taken into 
custody after examination of computer hard drives and 
chemicals seized on July 22. Col. Tariq Mubarak bin Daineh, 
Director of the Public Security Special Response Team (Najda) 
and Communications and Abdulla Abdul confirmed to the Embassy 
this morning that the six will be held for 45 days to develop 
a criminal case. 
 
2.  It appears as though the six detainees may have already 
started their efforts to elicit public sympathy. Col. Tariq, 
during his conversations with the A/RSO and PolOff, noted 
that the six have started a hunger strike to protest their 
incarceration. At this time, we have no other information or 
outside confirmation of this development. 
 
3.  Yesterday\'s arrests have aroused local suspicions about 
the GoB\'s motives. PolOff and PolFSN spoke with 
Parliamentarian Fareed Ghazi Raffee, legal counsel for 
Mohieddin Khan. Raffee expressed his dismay that no evidence 
was presented by the prosecutor while the six were awaiting 
detention at the Public Prosecutor\'s Office. He stated that 
the questioning was based on hearsay and circumstantial 
evidence. He believes that the case against Mohieddin is 
based on his having spent time in Afghanistan in 1989. Raffee 
stated that he did not know about the chemical and computer 
evidence until he read the Al Ayam and Gulf Daily News this 
morning. Rashid Al Ghayeb, Al Ayam reporter and former 
Fulbrighter, in his comments to PolFSN, reported that he 
doubts that Al Ayam was able to photograph and report on 
actual new evidence. He stated that this morning\'s photo of 
seized evidence looked \"like anything you could download off 
the Internet.\" He is confident that the re-arrest of the six 
is due to US pressure and the GoB\'s desire to put an end to 
the U.S. Embassy and the Navy\'s recent moves to transfer 
non-essential employees and family members. Al Wasat 
reporter, Hani Ferdan, who has followed the arrests and 
detention of possible terror suspects Mohammed Saleh Mohammed 
and Merbati, doubts if there is any new evidence. He stated 
that if there is any new evidence, it must have been planted 
to incriminate the defendants. Abdulla Hashim, legal counsel 
for five detainees, reported to PolFSN, that he believes that 
the decision to hold them for 45 days was a political 
decision since the Prosecutor did not present any evidence. 
Hashim plans to file a suit against the GoB for slander. 
 
4. Our public diplomacy guidance has been: 
 
--- A) We are trying to confirm reports of the re-arrest of 
the six. 
--- B) If these reports are accurate, it reflects GoB 
commitment to public safety and the security of its citizens 
and foreign guests. 
 
5. COMMENT: It is important to counter widespread public 
perception that the GoB action is just a put-up job designed 
to respond to USG pressure and reverse the travel warning, 
Embassy authorized departure and Navy involuntary departure 
of families.  We insist that the GoB action is not a gift to 
the USG, but rather, an action taken in light of its own 
security interests.  END COMMENT.

1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  June 9 marked the end of Parliament\'s 
second session with well-earned successes in both houses. 
Hampered by constitutional limitations, the elected Council 
of Representatives (COR) gravitated away from drafting 
legislation and exercised its oversight authority to its 
fullest extent, surprising its constituencies and forcing the 
GOB to rectify its mistakes.  Contrary to popular 
expectation, the appointed Shura Council drafted several new 
laws proving it was not just the King\'s rubber stamp but a 
progressive reform-minded legislative power. The COR must 
amend the 2002 Constitution to expand its legislative 
authority and become a real legislature.  Amending the 
constitution co-opts the rejectionists\' argument that there 
is a constitutional crisis.  In addition, if the COR delivers 
on issues of unemployment, discrimination and illegal 
naturalization, it will further erode the importance of the 
rejectionists.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
PARLIAMENT OVERSIGHT GOUGES THE GOVERNMENT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The Council of Representatives (COR) members, daunted 
by constitutional limitations on their powers to legislate, 
quickly chose to exercise more clearly defined government 
oversight powers.  In doing so, the COR forced the GOB to 
react, respond and reform.  Parliament\'s aggressiveness 
surprised the people and hurt the GOB.  The press avidly 
covered investigations and questioning of ministers related 
to alleged pension fund mismanagement and illegal 
naturalization.  The process undeniably produced the 
Parliament\'s crowning achievement for this session, the 
government\'s complete overhaul of the management of the 
pension fund system and its complete recapitalization at the 
GOB\'s expense.  At one point the COR seemed poised to vote 
the Finance Minister out of office, but it recoiled at the 
last instant.  This success has given the MPs confidence to 
summon other ministers for questioning on subjects ranging 
from variable completion times on road repair projects to 
allegations that the Finance Ministry is awarding contracts 
outside the established government procurement process. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SHURA COUNCIL - NOT NECESSARILY THE KING\'S MEN 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (C)  Having no oversight authority, the more experienced 
Shura Council (many members served in the pre-2002 Shura 
Council) decided to try to stretch its authority vis-a-vis 
the government by drafting reform legislation.  The Shura 
drafted nine recommended laws, one of which was its long 
awaited Press Law.  The draft included 86 new articles and 
differed radically from the 2002 law currently in force 
(although allegedly frozen).  The Shura Council\'s law is 
considered by many in Bahrain to be the most liberal press 
law in the Middle East.  Instead of accepting this landmark 
legislation, the government sent its own much more regressive 
draft bill to the COR, whose leading members have quietly 
told us that the COR will reject the government bill early in 
the next session after raking Cabinet Affairs Minister Al 
Muttawa over the coals in an open questioning session.  The 
Shura Council also drafted a Societies Law that governs 
extra-national NGO registrations and establishes regulations 
for their oversight.  In January, the Shura drafted a law to 
establish an Administrative Oversight Bureau that would fall 
directly under the authority of the King and oversees the 
activities of the ministries, official institutions, 
independent government bureaus and directorates.  The 
Ministries of Defense, Interior and the National Guard are 
excluded from the new bureau\'s purview.  This proposed law 
would dissolve the Financial Oversight Bureau that is 
currently under the Prime Minister\'s jurisdiction. 
 
4. (U)  Disappointingly, the COR allowed several of its 
legislative initiatives to languish.  For example, the COR 
did not finalize a draft amendment to change 26 clauses of 
the penal code, to ensure that punishment would match the 
magnitude of the crime. The inadequacy of the code was 
highlighted in May when 14 youths were arrested for 
soliciting signatures for a petition and charged with a crime 
that carried a life imprisonment sentence. (see ref a)  In 
June, MPs postponed passing a draft union law allowing 
government employees the right to form trade unions within 
ministries and government institutions.  This brought outrage 
from the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions (GFBTU) 
whose members attempted to stage a sit-in at Parliament. 
5. (U)   Even more surprising was the COR\'s rejection of 
draft laws that the public apparently supports.  In November 
2003, the King gave his blessing to COR members to draft a 
political parties law, allowing societies with political 
agendas to operate legally in Bahrain.  However six months 
later the COR voted down its own draft. This left several 
societies that engage in political activities in limbo. 
Instead the COR decided to draft a political societies law 
which will not be ready until next session.  MPs also 
rejected the long awaited draft Personal Status Law which 
sent expectations of women\'s rights activists plummeting.  In 
May, MPs rejected a call to make discrimination a crime 
punishable under Bahrain\'s penal code.  Human rights 
activists were very disappointed by this rejection.  Shi\'a 
embassy contacts have told EmbOFFs that any credibility gains 
in their community made by MPs during the pension fund 
investigation were lost with the rejection of this law. 
 
--------------- 
THE COR\'s GAFFS 
--------------- 
 
6. (U) Largely due to inexperience, some of the MPs\' 
initiatives and behavior were viewed as farcical.  These less 
stellar moments were highly publicized in the press. 
Damaging the COR\'s credibility the most was its attempt to 
push through its own lifelong monthly retirement benefit of 
BD3,250 (USD8,645) for serving one four-year term.  This 
initiative comes one year after the public already raised its 
eyebrows after the GOB gave each member a luxury car and 
BD10,000 (USD26,600) for winning a parliamentary seat.  In 
October 2003 MP Sameer Abdulla Al Shuwaikh was found guilty 
of passing BD1.2 million (USD3.2 million) in a series of bad 
checks to businessmen.  After paying a paltry BD500 
(USD1,330) fine, Al Shuwaikh returned to his parliamentary 
duties and was quickly named to the investigative committee 
on corrupt financial practices. At Parliament\'s last session 
before summer break, MP Sunni Islamist Jassim Al Saeedi spent 
15 minutes extolling Bahrain\'s progress in democratic reform 
and modernization and urged Bahrainis to fully support the 
Free Trade Agreement.  This same MP spent the majority of the 
year advocating a ban for \'alien\' ceremonies like Halloween 
and Christmas and the amputation of both hands for thievery. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
MORE CONFRONTATION WITH GOVERNMENT IN NEXT SESSION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7.  (C)  COR members are already planning their next session. 
 Major COR members already plan to call ministers to account. 
 First Deputy Chairman Abdulhadi Marhoon told PolOff on June 
9 that during the summer recess MPs will need to come up with 
a vision and strategic plan for the next two years.  Member 
of the Finance Committee Jehad Hassan Bukamal told PolOff on 
June 14 that ways to maximize the US-Bahrain Free Trade 
Agreement will need to be on every COR agenda. Most MPs agree 
with Egyptian parliamentary consultant Amro Barakat that 
before MPs can delve headstrong into drafting new 
legislation, they must seek amendment of Article 92 of the 
Constitution that allows the Cabinet to review draft 
legislation for up to two sessions, effectively stopping 
legislators from legislating. President of the Service 
Committee Dr. Ali Ahmed Abdulla told PolOff on June 8 that in 
order to gain credibility with the public, the COR will need 
to draft legislation that tackles important issues like 
illegal naturalization, economic development and 
unemployment.  The COR, he continued, will also need to push 
through amendments to the criminal code, and the personal 
status, political societies and labor laws. 
 
8.  (C)  COMMENT.   The successes of the National Assembly 
have demonstrated that the current structure of government 
based on the 2002 Constitution can work.  This weakens the 
rejectionists argument that a constitutional crisis exists in 
Bahrain.  However, the National Assembly has also amply 
demonstrated the 2002 Constitution\'s weaknesses. If the COR 
decides to pursue amendments to the constitution to increase 
legislative authority, it will end up co-opting the 
rejectionists\' platform further retaking their standing.  If 
the COR can deliver to its constituencies\' on the issues of 
unemployment, discrimination and illegal naturalization, the 
rejectionists will be rendered obsolete. END COMMENT.

1.  The six detainees held by the GOB on suspicion of 
conspiracy to commit terrorist acts (see ref) ended their 
hunger strike after four days. The detainees\' lawyer Abdullah 
Hashim was quoted in the Bahrain Tribune on July 19 that the 
six agreed to end the hunger strike due to the deteriorating 
health of detainees Yasser Kamal and Moheiddin Khan and 
because civil societies and human rights groups publicly 
expressed support of the detainees\' efforts to prove their 
innocence.  Hashim told PolOFF on July 18 the GOB allowed 
detainees\' families visitation rights but has denied 
visitation requests from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. 
 
2.  Hashim told PolOFF on July 18 that he anticipates a march 
in support of his clients to take place on July 23 following 
Friday sermons, but would not identify the organizers.  He 
also said that any protest must be carried out legally and 
peacefully. If not, Hashim is convinced that a violent 
protest will influence the case against his clients and he 
would be forced to publicly condemn the march.

CLIMATE STATEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 141379 
 
This appendix serves as an update to the 2003 Investment 
Climate Statement for Bahrain.  It has been provided to 
assist investors in the interim period resulting from the 
U.S. Government\'s decision to begin publishing the Country 
Commercial Guide (of which the Investment Climate Statement 
is a Chapter) on a calendar year basis, in January instead 
of august. 
 
The United States Government has reviewed the 2003 
Investment Climate Statement for Bahrain, and has noted the 
following changes that have occurred since its publication. 
In most circumstances, if a portion of the 2003 Investment 
Climate Statement has not been modified in this appendix, it 
is because the U.S. Government is satisfied that it 
continues to accurately reflect the state of affairs in 
Bahrain as of July 2004. 
 
OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
A new telecom law to open the sector to competition went 
into effect in January 2003. The Telecommunications 
Regulatory Authority (TRA) awarded a mobile 
telecommunications license to MTC Vodaphone, and Internet 
service provision licenses are currently available. All 
aspects of the telecommunications sector were officially 
opened to competition on July 1, 2004.  According to the 
TRA, new licensees will be operational towards the end of 
2004. 
 
The Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the Supreme 
Economic Council, has promoted a one-stop-shop formula for 
industries seeking to establish operations in Bahrain. 
Officials from the ministry note that 80 percent of licenses 
can be processed and verified within 24 hours. The remaining 
20 percent, however, are \"strategic\" licenses for which 
verification may take longer.

RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT 
 
In principle, private entities may freely establish, 
acquire, and dispose of interest in business enterprises, 
subject to the limitations noted in this chapter. 
Although foreigners generally may not acquire legal control 
of an existing Bahraini company, foreign investors may own 
up to 100 percent of a new company. According to Ministry of 
Finance & National Economy (MOFNE) officials, the U.S.- 
Bahrain BIT stipulates national treatment for citizens of 
both countries in each of their respective territories. This 
includes the retail industry, for which 51 percent Bahraini 
ownership was previously required. However, certain 
exemptions to this ruling are provided under existing 
Bahraini commercial registration laws.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
 
Bahrain experienced intermittent civil unrest in the mid 
1990s. Although the situation improved steadily after 1997, 
the 2002 upsurge in violence between Israelis and 
Palestinians sparked anti-Israeli and anti-American 
demonstrations in Bahrain. The protests peaked in April 2002 
when a mob attacked the U.S. Embassy.  Defense of the 
Embassy by Bahraini authorities resulted in the death of a 
demonstrator.  The 2003 Iraq war and subsequent U.S. 
operations in Iraq sparked a few political protests aimed at 
the American and British Embassies. 
 
In 2004, a conservative Islamic movement that condemns the 
influx of liberal Western influences to Bahrain promoted 
three incidents of vigilanteeism that damaged or destroyed 
expatriate property, vehicles, and local places of business. 
Among several large-scale marches in 2004 protesting 
internal issues, only one resulted in violence when police 
used force to disperse demonstrators. 
 
CORRUPTION: No significant changes since 2003. 
 
OPIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS: No significant

BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS 
 
Bahrain and the U.S. signed a bilateral investment treaty 
(BIT) in September 1999, the first BIT between the U.S. and 
a GCC state. The agreement entered into force in May 2001. 
In May 2004, the U.S. and Bahrain additionally concluded 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations aimed at encouraging 
trade, development, joint projects, and investment between 
the two countries. U.S. negotiations with Bahrain, which 
seek to promote Bahrain as a regional center for the 
production and distribution of U.S. goods and services, are 
the third FTA negotiations with an Arab country, and the 
first with a GCC country. The FTA draft is currently in a 90- 
day informal comment period, and may be signed in mid- 
September 2004.  Signature then requires approval from the 
legislative branches of the U.S. and Bahrain prior to 
implementation. The negotiated agreement may be viewed on 
the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) 
website: http://www.ustr.gov/new/fta/Bahrain/text/inde x.htm, 
or at the Government of Bahrain\'s FTA website: 
http://www.fta.gov.bh. The negotiated FTA does not include 
an investment chapter since the Bilateral Investment Treaty 
signed in 2001 already covers bilateral investment issues. 
Bahrain has bilateral investment protection agreements in 
place with several countries, including agreements on the 
promotion and protection of investments, agreements on the 
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of income 
tax evasion, agreements on economic, trade, and technical 
cooperation, and agreements on reciprocal exemptions 
relating to taxes on income from the international air 
transport business. According to MOFNE, as of 2004 the 
countries having bilateral investment agreements with 
Bahrain include: 
Algeria, China, Egypt, Jordan, Malaysia, Morocco, Syria, 
Philippines and the UK. Bahrain has economic and commercial 
cooperation agreements with Australia, Bangladesh, China, 
Egypt, France, Greece, India, (Iraq), Jordan, Morocco, the 
Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Syria, Tunisia, 
Turkey and the UK. Bahrain has air transportation tax 
agreements with China, France, Greece, Singapore, Turkey, 
UK, U.S., and Yemen, and two transportation agreements with 
Syria. Bahrain has concluded double taxation agreements with 
Egypt, France, India, Jordan, Malaysia, Morocco, the 
Philippines, Thailand and Tunisia.

Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  MFA officials gave assurances to Charge 
that the security and stability of Bahrain is the GOB\'s top 
priority.  As a signal that the GOB is serious about regional 
security concerns, MFA announced that Bahrain will host the 
next International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) 
National Gulf Security Conference scheduled for December. 
The conference will focus on regional defense cooperation 
with GCC partners, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and the 
United States.  IISS has extended an invitation to US 
National Security Advisor Condolezza Rice.  Charge 
underscored that there continue to be security challenges in 
the region and offered any assistance to aid the GOB in its 
efforts to meet these challenges.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) With the Minister of State and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs out of the country, on July 26, Charge Ziadeh called 
on the most senior officials at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Undersecretary Yousif Al Mahmoud, Assistant 
Undersecretary for Coordination and Follow-up Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa and Director of Bilateral 
Relations, Dr. Dhafer Al Umran.  U/S Al Mahmoud welcomed the 
opportunity to meet Charge Ziadeh and emphasized that the 
long-standing relationship between the two countries has 
always been one of full cooperation and frank communication. 
U/S Al Mahmoud referenced the Crown Prince\'s July meetings in 
Washington with VP Cheney, SecDef Rumsfeld, SecState Powell 
and National Security Advisor Rice as an indication of the 
bilateral willingness to discuss sensitive issues, such as 
security. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOB TAKES NATIONAL SECURITY SERIOUSLY 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) U/S Mahmoud assured Charge that ensuring its 
citizens\' safety is one of the GOB\'s top priorities.  Charge 
said that national security is essential and the actions 
taken by the GOB regarding the terror suspects must reflect 
the GOB\'s commitment to public safety and the security of its 
citizens.  Charge noted that there continue to be threats in 
the region and elements that constantly challenge Bahrain\'s 
security.  Emphasizing that frank discussion of sensitive 
issues is the only way to improve bilateral relations and 
move the relationship forward, Charge said that the USG will 
continue to raise security issues with the GOB and offered 
assistance to aid the GOB in its efforts to meet these 
challenges. 
 
4.  Affirming the GOB\'s commitment to regional security, A/US 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz announced that in coordination with IISS,

 1. (C) SUMMARY: Bahrain is an Islamic state with a 
population that is 98 percent Muslim.  Bahraini contacts have 
discussed the potential of a possible shift towards 
conservatism in Bahrain. However, some groups, such as Beit 
Al Qura,an, the Bahrain Women,s Society, and the Bahrain 
Youth Forum Society, are willing to directly engage with the 
USG to counter anti-Americanism and support moderate Islamic 
voices in the community. In addition, there are groups where 
direct engagement is a more sensitive subject. Discover Islam 
and Ahl Al Beit Society are groups that will not accept USG 
funds or host USG officials but would consider USG funded 
literature and American visitors who discuss topics relating 
to Islam. Post has steadily engaged Muslim communities via 
educational, cultural, and media resources.  The teaching of 
English is a primary tool for engaging Muslim communities. 
The English language is a commodity that is in high demand in 
Bahrain due to its status as a second language. In addition, 
the exposure of Bahrainis to diverse American teachers and 
ideas, via English language teaching, encourages moderation 
through cultural exposure. END SUMMARY 
 
---------------------- 
The Local Context 
---------------------- 
2. (C) Islam is the official religion of the Kingdom of 
Bahrain with a population that is 98 percent Muslim.  Muslim 
citizens adhere to the Shi,a and Sunni sects of Islam, with 
Shi,a constituting about two-thirds of the indigenous 
population. The Bahraini Constitution provides for freedom of 
religion, however there exist some limits on this right. The 
Government subjects both Sunni and Shi,a Muslims to some 
government control and monitoring, and there continues to be 
government discrimination against Shi,a Muslims.  As a 
result Shi,a Muslims often resent minority Sunni Muslim 
rule. 
 
3. (C) There are some warning signs indicating the potential 
of a possible shift towards conservatism in Bahrain from both 
Sunni and Shi,a communities.  In February 2004 Chairman of 
Al Asala Islamic society (the Sunni Salafi society in 
Bahrain) called to cancel the performance of Nancy Agram, a 
Lebanese singer, in Bahrain (See reftel E).  Young 
disaffected and bored Shi,a villagers demonstrated during 
the concert, which was subsequently disrupted and ultimately 
cancelled.  Weeks later, a rabidly anti-American 
Representative of Al Minbar Islamic Society, the political 
wing of Al Eslah Islamic Society (Muslim Brotherhood), called 
for the termination of the television show &Big Brother,8 
which was recorded in Bahrain, due to &immoral acts.8  The 
show was consequently cancelled (See reftel D).  In June 2004 
a Parliamentarian sub-committee passed a proposal for the 
segregation of Bahrain University students, based on gender, 
to be debated in Parliament. 
 
----------------------- 
Groups to Engage 
----------------------- 
4. (U) In Bahrain there are some groups that can be directly 
engaged by the USG to counter anti-Americanism and support 
moderate Islamic voices.  Beit Al Qur,an is an Islamic 
cultural center and museum that is owned by a moderate Sunni 
who seeks out and cooperates with the USG.  Most recently 
Beit Al Qur,an featured the &Edifices of Islam8 exhibition 
by US artist/architect Wahbi Alhariri-Rifai and hosted public 
lectures and discussions sponsored by the U.S. Embassy.  The 
Bahrain,s Women,s Society (BWS) has emerged as a leader 
among Bahrain,s NGOs (See reftel B).  Several BWS members 
have participated in International Visitors (IV) programs. 
One BWS IV participant is creating a child abuse hotline 
based on her experience in the U.S. The Bahrain Youth Forum 
Society is an independent, politically oriented youth 
organization composed of university students and young 
professionals.  This group displays a willingness to listen 
to America,s story although some condemn American policy 
(See reftel E). 
 
5. (U) In addition, there are groups where direct engagement 
is more sensitive.  These groups will not accept USG funds or 
host USG officials but will consider USG funded literature 
and American visitors who discuss topics relating to Islam. 
Discover Islam is a Sunni institution, subsidized by Saudi 
Arabia, to promote Islam primarily among foreigners.  The 
organization welcomes non-Arab Muslims as they seek speakers 
to speak about converting to Islam. Discover Islam twice 
hosted Jermaine Jackson, an American Muslim.  This summer 
Discover Islam is hosting American human resource trainer 
Maraim Lemu.  Ahl Al Beit Society is a Shi,a Islamic culture 
organization.  They promote Shi,a culture through publishing 
pamphlets, posters, and flyers to educate people about 
Shi,aism and Shi,a religious occasions.  Ahl Al Beit 
accepts Embassy pamphlets on Muslim life in America and 
posters illustrating mosques in America. 
 
------------------------------- 
Current Efforts By Post 
------------------------------- 
6. (U) Post has steadily engaged Muslim communities via 
educational, cultural, and media resources.  The teaching of 
English is a primary tool for engaging Muslim communities. 
English language skills are in high demand in Bahrain due to 
its status as a second language here. In addition, the 
exposure of Bahrainis to diverse American teachers and ideas, 
via English language teaching, encourages moderation through 
cultural exposure. The Regional English Language Office 
(RELO), established in September 2002, reaches out to a 
diverse audience including public school teachers and 
students, Ministry of Education officials, and the Bahrain 
University community. RELO conducts workshops at various 
venues where American Teaching English as a Foreign Language 
(TEFL) specialists deliver workshops about English Language 
teaching in the context of critical thinking, democracy, 
citizenship and social responsibility. 
 
7. (U) The American Cultural and Educational Center (ACEC) 
has been receiving support from Post since its establishment 
in 2001. Although ACEC was initially exclusive to elite 
audiences, who are able to pay the relatively high tuition 
for English classes, Embassy support makes it possible to 
reach out to a more diverse audience. Post funded a training 
program for Ministry of Education English language teachers 
to hone their English skills.  ACEC is also hosting and 
administering the Post funded Micro Scholarship for English 
Language study that reaches out to economically disadvantaged 
students from Bahrain public schools. While improving their 
English language skills, students and trainees are also 
learning American values of democracy and social 
responsibility through the American published textbooks, such 
as the Scholastic,s materials, and enhancement activities 
such as visits and discussions at the U.S. Embassy. 
 
8. (U) The American Studies Center (ASC), of the University 
of Bahrain, receives grants from Post and offers a minor in 
American Studies to students who study American literature, 
culture, history and government. Through ASC, Post has been 
able to program a number of American speakers for lectures at 
the University and the community. Most recently James Zogby, 
founder and President of the Arab American Institute, was 
invited to discuss American policy in the region and the 
upcoming Presidential elections (See reftel C). 
 
9. (U) Embassy officials also engage Muslim groups by 
attending majalis, or salons, and participating in public 
debates about American policy. The Me,tem Al Haddada majlis 
is composed of middle class Shi,a laborers, teachers, 
doctors, and some unemployed.  The former DCM attended the 
majlis regularly to explain, argue and defend American 
policy. The group is critical but willing to participate in a 
debate with Embassy officials about democratic reform, civic 
responsibility, and U.S. policy. 
 
10. (U) Various Bahrain TV programs provide a venue to reach 
out to Muslim audiences.  &Beyond the News8 is a program 
dedicated to political debates.  The former DCM appeared on 
this program to explain U.S. policy on Iraq.  &Bab el 
Bahrain8 is an Arabic language program dedicated to provide 
insight to cultural opportunities in Bahrain.  The APAO has 
appeared on this program to discuss academic/professional 
exchange programs and their value to bilateral relations and 
mutual understanding. 
 
11. (U) COMMENT: Post will continue to engage Muslim 
audiences by expanding on current programs and maintaining 
communication.  The recipients of Micro Scholarships will 
more than double this academic year while new student 
exchange programs may be implemented.  Post is seeking 
increased funding to expand the Fulbright student program. 
MEPI small grant projects will commence this fall.  Embassy 
officials are also poised to find and reach out to other 
potentially receptive audiences in Bahrain. END COMMENT

SUBJECT: NDI SUCCEEDS IN GIVING BAHRAIN\'S YOUTH THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: The MEPI-funded National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) succeeded in promoting political participation by 
organizing Bahrain\'s first-ever Youth Forum.  Approximately 
50 percent of Bahrain\'s population is under 30 years of age, 
and as such, Bahrain\'s democratic reform depends on the 
inclusion and participation of its youth in the political 
process.  This forum gave Bahrain\'s youth the opportunity to 
directly engage Bahrain\'s leadership on issues relevant to 
its generation.  Topping the list of issues was the failure 
of meaningful dialogue between opposition societies and the 
GOB.  Other salient issues included unemployment, 
discrimination, transparency, low wages and housing. 
Interest was signified by the level of participation.  NDI 
invited 100 members of political and social societies and 
over 300 showed up.  Enthusiasm has generated a desire to 
pursue similar events in the future.  NDI is \'on message\' by 
organizing events such as these and helping young adults 
develop into agents of change.  Post recommends that MEPI 
support future events such as this forum. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------ 
FORUM FORMAT 
------------ 
 
2.  (U) The July 18 \"Cafe Dialogue\" was held at Bahrain\'s SAS 
Radisson Hotel.  The young adult participants (ages 18-30) 
were divided into \'cafes\' and given 90 minutes to determine 
issues relevant to Bahrain\'s youth.  Cafe leaders summarized 
the discussions and presented them to the \"elders\"--members 
of Parliament, religious societies, NGOs, media and GOB 
officials. 
 
---------------- 
YOUTHS\' CONCERNS 
---------------- 
 
3. (U) In his opening speech, President of the Bahrain Youth 
Forum Society Hussain Al Eskafi said that Bahrain is full of 
young people but no one is willing to listen to them.  The 
young participants considered the national dialogue between 
the opposition and the GOB on constitutional issues a 
failure, citing little impact on the GOB\'s decision making. 
They pointed to sectarian disunity, control by the elite, and 
the absence of true popular support for the dialogue as 
contributing to this failure.  In addition to the 
constitutional issue, cafe leaders ranked the following 
issues in order of importance: naturalization, unemployment, 
discrimination, low wages, corruption (administrative and 
financial) and housing.  President of Al Shabiba Youth 
Society Hussain Al Hulaibi added that political societies 
need to make more of an effort to engage youth and grant them 
a political role.  The Bahrain Youth Forum Society plans to 
host quarterly forums in the future to continue political 
discussions and coalesce ideas for the purpose of political 
participation. 
 
-------------------------- 
STATEMENTS VERSUS DIALOGUE 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) To represent the leadership, NDI attracted prominent 
Bahrainis representing the full political spectrum. These 
included Second Deputy Chairman of the Council of 
Representatives Shaikh Adel Al Moawda, Vice President of Al 
Wefaq National Islamic Society Shaikh Hassan Mushaima, 
President of the National Democratic Action Society (NDAS) 
Abdul Rahman Al Noaimi, Shura Council member Ibraheem 
Bashmia, and columnist Sameera Rajab.  With the exception of 
MP Shaikh Adel Moawda, who stated that \"any dialogue is 
better than no dialogue at all,\" statements made by the 
\"elders\" did not directly address concerns presented by the 
younger participants.  They preferred to restate their 
standard platforms. 
 
5.  (U) COMMENT:  Even though the forum did not result in a 
full exchange between young and old, this event proved a 
significant start in the right direction.  A primary goal of 
MEPI is advocating the expansion of political participation. 
The outstanding reputation of NDI\'s programs and NDI\'s 
engagement with opposition society members, NGOs, the 
Municipal Council, the Shura Council and the elected Council 
of Representatives, helped draw over 300 participants.  Post 
encourages NEA/PI to continue to fund NDI to support the 
development of political participation and similar forums in 
Bahrain.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: WATER, POWER AND SECURITY: BAHRAIN\'S MINISTER OF 
ELECTRICITY AND WATER WELCOMES CHARGE 
 
REF: MANAMA 496 
 
1. SUMMARY: Minister of Electricity and Water Shaikh 
Abdullah bin Salman Khalid al Khalifa, featured lately in 
local news reports because of a series of rolling 
brownouts, welcomed the opportunity to explain on July 27 
to newly arrived Chargie how his ministry is meeting its 
mandate to produce, transmit and distribute power and water 
in Bahrain.  He explained that the power distribution 
network, designed to accommodate a 20 percent load 
increase, has had to service an 80 percent demand increase 
over the past three years.  Monies for necessary 
infrastructure improvements do not come from consumers, 
since power is subsidized and consumers pay 20 percent of 
operating expenses for water and 75 percent for power. 
(NOTE: Overhead costs are not included in these 
calculations.  END NOTE).  Although multiple ministries 
share control over power and water resources, the Minister 
said he is doing what he can to enhance current service and 
to secure sufficient power and water for the next 15 
years.  A GCC power grid, set for operation in 2008, and a 
possible GCC water-sharing scheme are part of the 
Minister\'s toolkit.  The Minister, a 36-year veteran of the 
Bahrain Defense Forces, also took this opportunity to 
stress the importance of security in Bahrain and of the 
continuation of our joint security relationship to promote 
regional stability.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------- 
SHARED RESOURCES 
-------- 
 
2. The Minister of Electricity and Water emphasized that 
several ministries have a stake in power and water 
resources: the Ministry of Municipalities and Agriculture 
uses groundwater, the Ministry of Works and Housing uses 
treated sewage water, the Ministry of Health is responsible 
for water quality testing, and the Public Authority for the 
Environment has an interest in the condition of the 
underground freshwater aquifer.  Further, the Ministry of 
Finance and National Economy holds the pursestrings and 
makes decisions regarding facilities, maintenance contracts 
and inputs purchases, such as securing the supply of 
natural gas used to generate power and desalinate water. 
[NOTE: Currently Bahrain depends on domestic supplies of 
natural gas, which just meet current demand.  The Ministry 
of Finance and National Economy is exploring a gas deal 
with Qatar, as part of a possible Qatar-Kuwait pipeline, to 
secure sufficient supplies over the next 10 to 15 years. 
END NOTE]. 
 
-------- 
WATER 
-------- 
 
3. Long range ability to supply sufficient water seems to 
be on track.  Bahrain\'s water supply is currently one-third 
groundwater and two-thirds desalinated water.  Water 
production capacity at Hidd II, now 30 million cubic 
meters, will reach 90 million cubic meters in 2006. 
Further, there are early-stage GCC-internal discussions to 
develop a GCC water linkage to mitigate water shortage risk 
in the region. 
 
-------- 
POWER 
-------- 
 
4. On power production, the Minister said that the system 
is working 100 percent.  With the onset of production from 
Bahrain\'s new Hidd II power/water facility in April, the 
GoB has an 1850 MW capacity .  This leaves a 200 MW 
production margin over current maximum usage during the 
summer months.  [NOTE: The Minister said that 65-70 percent 
of power production goes to air conditioning, so summer 
usage is three times higher than wintertime demand.  END 
NOTE]. As of April, the Government of Bahrain no longer 
needs to purchase 270 MW of electricity from Bahrain\'s 
aluminum smelter, ALBA, as it had for many years; in fact, 
now the GoB sells its excess output to ALBA in the off 
season.  Further, on July 31 the GoB signed an agreement 
for a private power production facility in Al Azel (see 
reftel), so sufficient production capability seems assured 
over the long term. 
 
5. Power transmission is also proceding according to plan. 
Minister Al Khalifa told Chargie that plans for the GCC 
power grid are on track for the 2008 target completion 
date, reducing the risk of local power outages if a 
production facility temporarily goes offline. 
 
6. The power distribution network is where the Minister 
admitted there are some difficulties that caused brownouts 
earlier this summer.  The network is being used to the 
maximum and needs to be upgraded to handle the loads 
customers demand and the output power plants are able to 
produce, he said.  Outlying areas, populated by Bahrain\'s 
poorer populations, are most susceptible to power outages, 
in large part because many more air conditioners and water 
heaters were installed there in the last few years without 
accompanying infrastructure improvements.  Implementing 
2006 plans in 2005 should help ease the burden, the 
Minister added. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
7. Shifting into Arabic--clearly the Minister\'s preferred 
language--and to issues close to his heart, 36-year veteran 
of the Bahrain Defense Forces Minister al Khalifa stressed 
to Chargie the need for a safe and secure Bahrain.  He 
emphasized also the need for enhanced regional stability 
and encouraged continued U.S. cooperation on regional 
security matters.

Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  On August 2, Minister of Justice Jawad Al 
Arrayed stressed to Charge that there is strong political 
will at the highest levels of the GOB to fight terrorism and 
ensure national security.  Minister Al Arrayed told Charge, 
in confidence, that H.M. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa is 
personally lobbying members of Parliament to ensure passage 
of Bahrain\'s new counter-terrorism law.  This law is designed 
to fill any gaps that exist in the criminal code to combat 
terrorism. Al Arrayed also intimated that the King in his 
capacity as Head of the Supreme Judicial Council, legally 
ordered the Attorney General to resolve his communication 
issues with the police and prepare a solid case against the 
six Bahraini terror suspects (see reftel) within the context 
of Bahraini law.  Al Arrayed said the King wants to send a 
strong message to those elements that challenge security, 
\"Don\'t play games with the security of Bahrain.\" END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
BAHRAIN\'s CT LAW 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The Justice Minister told Charge that in November 
2003 the King personally tasked him to draft a 
counter-terrorism law.  He explained that this law is 
designed to fill any gaps that exist in the criminal code to 
fight terrorism. The Justice Minister added that the law 
passed Cabinet review and now requires Parliamentary 
approval. Al Arrayed expects there to be some debate in 
Parliament, because there are some who view the 
counter-terrorism law as a direct response to US concerns. 
However, Al Arrayed stressed to Charge that the King wants 
this law to move forward and he has personally started 
lobbying members of Parliament to ensure the law\'s passage. 
Parliament will convene for its third session in October. 
 
-------------------------- 
DUE PROCESS - BAHRAINI SIX 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Responding to Charge\'s request, the Justice 
Minister clarified judicial procedure as previously reported 
(see reftel) with regards to the case against the six 
Bahraini terror suspects.  He expects the case to go to 
trial, but did not specify when.  The Justice Minister 
acknowledged that there are communication problems between 
the Ministry of Interior and the Public Prosecutor\'s Office 
that have created unwarranted obstacles.  He added that the 
separation of the Public Prosecutor\'s Office from the 
Ministry of Interior (less than one year ago) and the youth 
and inexperience of some prosecutors also contributed to 
communication difficulties. 
 
4. (C)  Al Arrayed said nonetheless, the King personally 
ordered the Attorney General to fully cooperate and 
communicate with the Ministry of Interior to prepare the case 
for the prosecution within the context of Bahraini law. 
Minister Al Arrayed explained that with regard to legal 
issues, the Prosecutor\'s Office comes under the jurisdiction 
of the Supreme Judicial Council.  The King is the Head of the 
Supreme Judicial Council and as such has the legal right to 
order the Attorney General to responsibly carry out his 
duties.

1.   (C) SUMMARY.  Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al 
Khalifa and select members of his Cabinet stressed to Charge 
that security is Bahrain\'s utmost priority and that 
consequently Bahrain will remain at a heightened state of 
vigilance.  PM stressed that full cooperation and sharing of 
information are the keys to the continued success of the 
long-standing relationship between the US and Bahrain.  The 
PM expressed dismay at the Navy\'s sudden decision to evacuate 
its dependents citing a failure in sharing information. 
Minister of Interior Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa said that 
the GOB is working to establish a counter-terrorism center 
that will help solve information sharing and action 
coordination within the GOB.  Stressing Bahrain\'s commitment 
to national and regional security, the PM said that the 
Cabinet drafted a counter-terrorism law he expects the 
National Assembly to approve in October.  Charge welcomed 
GOB\'s latest efforts in combating terrorism and said the GOB 
must demonstrate the political will to fight terrorism and 
send a strong signal to any elements that would undertake 
actions threatening Bahrain\'s security.  Charge lauded 
progress on the counter-terrorism law and noted that many 
parties concerned with Bahrain\'s security will be following 
the judicial proceedings of the case against the six terror 
suspects (see reftel).  END SUMMARY.

NAVY DEPENDENTS 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C) Welcoming the Charge to Bahrain, on July 31, the 
Prime Minister quickly moved through pleasantries and steered 
the discussion to the issue of national security. The PM 
noted that the relationship between our two countries has 
been one of full cooperation and sharing of information.  The 
PM expressed his disappointment about the Navy\'s sudden 
decision to evacuate its dependents.  The PM assured Charge 
that the GOB is doing everything in its power to keep Bahrain 
secure and stable and stated his hope that the Navy\'s 
dependents return to Bahrain soon. 
 
---------------------------- 
GOB\'s COMMITMENT TO SECURITY 
---------------------------- 
 
3.   (C) The following ministers whose portfolios include 
security issues were also present at the meeting:  Minister 
of Interior Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa and Undersecretary 
for Immigration and Passport Affairs Rashid bin Khalifa Al 
Khalifa. Minister of Finance and National Economy Abdulla 
Saif and HH Shaikh Salman bin Khalifa bin Shaikh Al Khalifa 
of the PM\'s Court (the PM\'s son) also attended.  U/S Rashid 
informed Charge that the Saudi causeway, all naval ports and 
Muharraq airport are currently on heightened alert. Minister 
of Interior Shaikh Rashid stated that the Cabinet has 
finalized a draft counter-terrorism law. Minister Saif 
offered that the Cabinet is working on the formation of a 
counter-terrorism center that will allow rapid information 
sharing among ministries and departments in the GOB and with 
its allies. 
 
4.  (C) The Charge welcomed the GOB\'s latest security 
measures. Charge said it is important that Bahrain\'s 
leadership signals it has zero tolerance for any elements 
that seek to destabilize security in Bahrain and has the 
political will to do something about it. The PM acknowledged 
that the regional security environment has worsened during 
the past year.  He said that Bahrain does not exist in 
isolation and is not immune to terrorism in the region.  The 
PM likened the situation to \"a boat sailing upriver makes 
waves that hit both shores.\" The PM emphasized that Bahrain 
is responding to security concerns with a high level of 
vigilance, which he asserted, has become Bahrain\'s new norm. 
 
5.  (C) The PM said that having the Navy and the Embassy on 
prolonged alert damages Bahrain\'s reputation as a favorable 
place to visit and conduct business.  Minister Saif expressed 
concern that prolonged alert status might affect the roll-out 
of the Free Trade Agreement. Charge stressed that a signal 
of a strong security environment underpinned by rule of law 
was the best mechanism to encourage foreign direct 
investment. 
 
6.  (C)  In a separate meeting, on August 1, Charge met with 
the Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed bin Ibrahim Al 
Mutawwa.  Al Mutawwa stated that in the current security 
environment, no one is immune to terrorism, including 
Bahrain.  He assured Charge that the GOB is taking 
preemptive rather than reactive measures to fight terrorism. 
He confirmed that the draft counter-terrorism law passed 
Cabinet review and would address legal requirements to combat 
terrorism that Bahrain\'s criminal code may not cover.  At the 
Charge\'s request, Al Mutawwa agreed to forward a copy of the 
draft law to Charge. 
 
7.  (C)  In closing, Al Mutawwa inquired about the status of 
the Bahrain School.  (One of his sons is scheduled to attend 
in the Fall.)  Al Mutawwa asserted that the Bahrain School 
has been an anchor of our long-standing bilateral 
relationship.  The school\'s academic excellence has prepared 
many Bahrainis for higher education in the US.  Charge 
informed Al Mutawwa that the situation is being discussed in 
Washington, DC and hopes that a decision will be made soon. 
 
8.   (C) COMMENT.  The PM signaled by the selection of 
ministers included in the meeting that his assurances on 
security will be carried out.  In stressing the link between 
national security and economic development, the PM underlined 
a key motivation driving him to ensure that Bahrain is safe 
and secure. END COMMENT.

(C-NE4-00522) 
 
REF: STATE 149503 
 
Classified By: CDA SUSAN ZIADEH. REASON 1.4(C). 
 
(C/NF) The Bahraini business community is convinced that the 
U.S.-Bahrain FTA is a positive development.  Yet they are 
perplexed by this new mechanism. Continued public diplomacy 
outreach--by both GOB and USG--can help counter some of the 
misimpressions about the FTA, what it means, and what it can 
help accomplish.  The business community and labor leaders 
are seeking guidance from all corners on how to turn the FTA 
into business deals and to create jobs.  Embassy Public 
Affairs and Commercial sections will work with MEPI-sponsored 
technical assistance teams and the GOB to address these 
concerns and help lead the Bahraini business community to 
successful FTA implementation.   Responses in this cable are 
keyed to questions reftel. 
 
A. (C/NF)  The business community has run with the 
government\'s pro-FTA message, and now the GOB is trying to 
manage what they fear may be unrealistic expectations. 
 
B. (C/NF) The business community believes it should benefit 
from the FTA.  However, with a few exceptions, business 
people do not yet understand how to translate this new policy 
into business deals. They have asked for, and will require, 
quite a bit of handholding to make implementation a success. 
 
(C/NF) The insurance industry fears outside competition 
most--ironically so, given that the sector is relatively open 
already and AIG has a long-standing presence in Bahrain.  The 
textile/garment businesses expect their businesses to grow 
most as a result of the FTA.  Manama\'s Pakistani-owned 
textile mill has made a substantial investment to expand 
capacity to add a fabric finishing process to its repertoire 
here in Bahrain and has initiated a joint venture by 
purchasing a defunct factory in the United States.  However, 
garment factories, more likely to be adversely affected by 
global competition beginning in 2005, have not made similar 
investments but expect the FTA to take care of their business 
problems, past and future. 
 
(C/NF) Overall, the sense among the business community is 
that the FTA offers many potential commercial opportunities, 
but they do not know how to take advantage of these trade 
openings. 
 
C. (C/NF)  FTA negotiations have been concluded.  However, 
Post notes that the textile sector was the most vociferous 
and organized during FTA negotiations.  They pushed for duty 
free access, lenient rules of origin, 10-year tariff 
preference levels well beyond current levels of trade, and 
technical assistance to refocus and revive the sunset 
industry. 
 
D. (C/NF)  The textile sector placed the onus of potential 
job losses resulting from the end of ATC quotas on the 
government if negotiators did not secure sufficently 
favorable FTA terms to ensure that their sunset industry 
would thrive.  Business owners and general managers, and to a 
lesser extent the labor union, lobbied the Ministry of 
Industry, the National Assembly, the Bahrain Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, and U.S. and Bahraini negotiators 
directly to make their case. The GOB listened for two 
reasons.  Textiles are Bahrain\'s primary non-oil export to 
the United States.  More importantly, the roughly 3000 
Bahraini textile workers (out of a total of 12,000 workers in 
the sector) are hard-to-employ, semi-skilled, conservative, 
Shi\'a women who often support eight family members.  These 
workers face the possibility of massive layoffs within the 
next year due to global competition.  Such layoffs would 
increase poverty among the already poor and contribute to the 
potential for social unrest. 
 
(C/NF) Board members of the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, the Bahrain Export Development Society, 
Businessmen\'s Society and Businesswomen\'s Society have asked 
not only their own government, but the USG as well, to help 
them figure out how to take advantage of FTA.  The Bahrain 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Commerce 
and the Ministry of Finance and National Economy\'s Economic 
Development Board are taking the lead on joint committees to 
help the business community take the next steps, but it is 
still too early to see results.  There is an explicit need 
for specific, project-oriented, U.S.-Bahraini B-2-B 
networking, and there is a hope among Bahraini business that 
the new AmCham can help facilitate these trade connections. 
The Embassy has proposed programs, such as International 
Buyer Programs or Reverse Gold Key-style trade delegations, 
but the business community\'s initial interest has not 
translated into participation, presumably awaiting final 
verification of the FTA. 
 
E. (C/NF) To the extent that local labor pays attention to 
economic policy developments, it is also confused about what 
the FTA will do for workers.  Workers regularly confuse FTA 
with WTO.  Many garment workers believe that FTA provides an 
extension of existing ATC quotas and is a panacea that will 
create more and better jobs in their sector.  There is a real 
need for intensified public diplomacy outreach to labor 
leaders and workers. 
 
F. (C/NF) Textile workers expect that FTA will save their 
jobs and yield higher pay as well.  Some workers have told 
EmbOffs that, now that we have \'signed\' an FTA with Bahrain, 
it is the USG\'s responsibility to ensure that they have jobs, 
since the FTA is all about creating jobs for Bahrain.  Yet in 
discussions about the FTA,the inclusion of protective labor 
clauses is not mentioned.  Again, public diplomacy can help 
clarify what the FTA can and cannot do for workers.

-------------- 
(C/NF) SECURITY 
--------------- 
 
(C/NF) 1. Minister of Industry--and more importantly trusted 
Senior Advisor to the King (and a member of his informal 
kitchen cabinet)--Dr. Hassan Fakhro opened and closed his 
August 2 welcoming meeting with Charge by addressing our 
current security relationship.  The Minister straight-away 
said that the possible DODDS Bahrain School closure is 
unsettling to many in Bahrain, noted its central role in 
cementing the bilateral relationship, and pressed for the 
issue to be resolved soon. Charge said that, with the school 
year fast approaching, the USG is moving toward a final 
decision. 
 
(C/NF) 2. The Minister, who attended the G-8 Sea Island 
Summit with the King, noted that the King has tremendous 
respect for President Bush and that he and the Crown Prince 
have strong relations with the Administration.  Having 
established the King\'s and the Crown Prince\'s pro-U.S. 
stance, the Minister said that \"higher-ups\" would work with 
the Embassy on all issues, security in particular, and would 
provide answers to satisfy us, if we let them know what it is 
that we need.  The Minister sees a lack of communication as 
the root cause for the current state of the U.S.-Bahraini 
security relationship and offered personally to act as 
Embassy\'s direct but informal channel to the King.  Most 
importantly, the Minister said that in times of stress, it is 
important to maintain a cool head, to communicate, and not to 
overreact.  \"Overreaction can create problems,\" was his final 
statement. 
 
------- 
(U) FTA 
------- 
 
(U) 3. On FTA, Minister Fakhro told Charge August 2 that 
Bahrain depends on the U.S. for its economic guidance. 
Responding to Charge\'s question of what we could do to help 
implement FTA successfully, the Minister said that USG and 
consultants are already studying available resources to 
maximize benefits.  He said business, too, particularly in 
the textiles sector, is studying the text of the FTA 
carefully to discover in the fine print ways to profit from 
the agreement.  The ongoing public comment period is helping 
the learning process along, and one day, the Minister noted, 
\"we will all be wiser.\"  There is already interest in new 
industrial investment, and the Minister expects this interest 
to increase once the FTA is finalized. 
 
(U) 4. Exhibiting Pollyanna-like optimism, the Minister 
pointed to tremendous post-FTA textile job creation in 
Jordan, and said that he expects the textile and garment 
industry sector to benefit most from the FTA.  He noted the 
industry\'s interest in expanding existing factories and 
starting new garment factories.  These developments would 
affect employment considerably, he said, especially if 
Bahrainization rates reach the targeted 80 to 90 percent. 
Asked about the industry\'s ability to compete with global 
labor markets, the Minister admitted that industry would need 
to work on this issue, but quickly added that the people 
employed in this industry would not readily be employed 
otherwise, and so would be willing to accept \"reasonable\" 
salaries, allowing the factories to remain competitive. 
 
(C)  5.  Comment:  Fakhro is clearly worried that closure of 
the school will damage Bahrain\'s ability to attract foreign 
direct investment, undercutting the positive momentum of the 
FTA signing.  For moderate, oil-poor and majority Shi\'a 
Bahrain, a loss of economic confidence or flight of expat 
businesses to Dubai and other regional locales offering 
competitive services - including top-flight schools - would 
be a heavy blow that could slow, if not derail, the GOB\'s 
political and economic reform program.

5. (S/NF) Charge asked for an update on the investigation. 
Shaikh Rashid stated that Bahrain is in a new era of 
democracy and the GOB must demonstrate credibility to the 
public regarding the re-arrest of the six extremists so soon 
after their earlier release.  He affirmed that the six 
extremists were working toward an attack but admitted that so 
far the case is legally difficult to prove. He stated that a 
counter-terrorism law King Hamad supports is now ready for 
the Parliament to review and will likely be approved. The 
Minister indicated that the MOI could present a case to the 
prosecutor in advance of the 45-day detention period if 
sufficient evidence is developed; alternatively, should 
additional time be needed, the detention could be extended. 
The MOI and Bahrain\'s National Security Agency (NSA) will 
continue to work on the case. He acknowledged Ministry of 
Interior (MOI) and NSA shortcomings in investigative 
techniques and interrogations, and was unsure whether 
sufficient evidence has been developed to connect the six men 
with crimes. He did recognize that the computer forensics 
investigation has yielded bomb making plans, but was not sure 
whether it would meet the threshold for prosecution. Shaikh 
Rashid asked for Embassy assistance in developing evidence 
and the complete sharing of information.

effort.  Shaikh Rashid responded that he had initiated this 
idea in his previous position as Chief of Staff of the 
Bahrain Defense Forces and given current trends in the 
region, it was more critical than ever that Bahrain establish 
this capability. The Shaikh asked the Charge for assistance 
in establishing a CT Operations Center (CTOC) (reftel) in 
Manama to coordinate the efforts of the MOI, NSA, Bahrain 
Defense Forces, National Guard and U.S. agencies. NOTE: The 
MOI provided RSO a copy of their initial CTOC plan. RSO will 
request assistance from DS/ATA and S/CT to pursue the 
request. END NOTE. 
 
7. (S/NF) The Charge expressed appreciation for MOI 
cooperation and indicated that the Embassy would inquire 
about the Department providing assistance for a CTOC. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  COMMENT:  ORCA has been working to assist in 
developing additional information, such as computer analysis, 
that can be used to pin a case on the detainees.  The CTOC is 
a step in the right direction to help Bahrain iron out 
interagency communication and turf battles.  How long it will 
take to stand up and how effectively its members will play 
remains to be seen - but recognition of the need and movement 
to stand up a CTOC on the part of the GOB is a welcome sign.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN\'S FOREIGN MINISTER DISCUSSES DOD SCHOOL 
AND  IRAQI PRIME MINISTER ALLAWI VISIT 
 
Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin 
Mubarak Al Khalifa stressed to Charge during an August 4 
meeting the need to find a way to work together to keep the 
most important cultural tie, the Department of Defense 
Bahrain School, operational.  Shaikh Mohammed conveyed GOB\'s 
offer of financial assistance to help the school transition 
to a post-DOD status, if DOD decided it would not sustain the 
school for the long term. On Iraq, the Foreign Minister 
characterized Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi\'s August 2 visit a 
success during which he met with King Hamad and PM Khalifa. 
The GOB did not commit to sending troops to Iraq at this time 
in response to Allawi\'s request.  However, Shaykh Mohammed 
indicated that any troop commitment would only be done as 
part of an overall GCC decision, and that the matter would 
likely be raised at the September GCC meeting scheduled to 
take place in Riyadh. The Foreign Minister relayed Allawi\'s 
concern that fighters training in the Afghanistan/Iran border 
areas are being allowed to transit Iran into Iraq. According 
to the Foreign Minister, Allawi solicited GOB\'s help in 
weighing in with Iran on this issue. END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
THE DOD BAHRAIN SCHOOL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The Foreign Minister welcomed Charge to Bahrain and 
quickly turned the discussion to the fate of the Bahrain 
School.  Shaikh Mohammed told Charge that so often the 
bilateral relationship focuses on political and economic 
affairs.  However, he stressed there should be equal 
importance in maintaining cultural ties and that the Bahrain 
School is the strongest cultural tie of the bilateral 
relationship. The Foreign Minister reiterated that over 350 
non-Navy students could be affected by closure of the school 
and underscored that Americans who want to establish 
businesses in Bahrain could be affected as well if there is 
no school for their children.  \"Closing the school should not 
be an option,\" he said.  Shaikh Mohammed admitted that 
terrorism exists everywhere but asserted that closing the 
school will send a signal to terrorists that their tactic to 
disrupt U.S.-Arab relations is working.  \"We do not want 
terrorists to win,\" he stated.  Shaikh Mohammed offered GOB 
financial assistance to help DOD transition the school to a 
post-DOD status, if necessary.  Charge assured the Foreign 
Minister that the GOB\'s views about the school have been 
registered in Washington.  Charge confirmed that a meeting is 
scheduled for August 4 to discuss the issue and she would 
again convey to Washington the GOB\'s great interest in the 
fate of the school, its importance to the bilateral 
relationship, and the GOB\'s offer of assistance. 
 
------------------------ 
IRAQI PM MEETS WITH GOB 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  Shaikh Mohammed then turned the discussion to Iraqi 
Prime Minister Allawi\'s August 2 visit.  The Foreign Minister 
relayed that Allawi\'s met with His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa 
Al Khalifa and Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa 
and thanked the GOB for its continued cooperation and 
support. Shaikh Mohammed took pride in the historically 
strong relationship between the two countries and noted GOB 
actions that demonstrated Bahrain\'s support of Iraq: Bahrain 
assumed protecting power of Iraqi missions in many countries; 
the GOB was the first GCC country to recognize the Iraqi 
Governing Council (IGC); and the GOB was the first to open 
their embassy in Iraq in the post-war era. 
 
---------------------------- 
MUSLIM/ARAB TROOPS TO IRAQ 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The Foreign Minister attended Allawi\'s meeting with 
the Prime Minister.  He relayed that the primary objective of 
Allawi\'s visit was to request the GOB to send troops to Iraq 
as peacekeeping and stabilization contingents which would 
serve with the current coalition forces.  Shaikh Mohammed 
indicated the GOB did not commit to send troops at this time 
and that any decision to send troops would be done within a 
GCC context.  The GOB committed to discussing the issue of 
sending troops at the upcoming September GCC meeting in 
Riyadh.  In the meantime, the GOB offered training to be 
conducted in Bahrain, to enhance Iraqi naval forces 
capabilities. 
 
----------------------------- 
IRAQ\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  The Foreign Minister told the Charge that Allawi is 
\"not happy\" with Iraq\'s relationship with Iran.  Allawi told 
the PM that evidence exists that fighters training along the 
Afghanistan/Iraq border were being allowed to transit Iran 
and foment trouble in Iraq.  Prime Minister Allawi requested 
the GOB\'s help to raise this issue with the Iranians.  In his 
capacity as GCC Chairman, the Foreign Minister informed us he 
was meeting with Iran\'s Ambassador to Bahrain later today. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C) All in all, Shaikh Mohammed considered Allawi\'s visit 
a success and one that established important face-to-face 
leadership relations.  Seeking their moral support, Allawi 
invited the GOB to attend the September Donor Conference in 
Tokyo, even though he recognized that the GOB is unable to 
contribute monetarily to the reconstruction and development 
of Iraq.  The Foreign Minister added that Bahrain can be 
helpful to Iraq through private sector investment.  He also 
indicated that the GOB requested consideration of landing 
rights in Iraq for Bahrain-based Gulf Airlines, citing 
maritime transportation as inefficient if Bahrain is to 
pursue business and investment opportunities in Iraq.

SUBJECT: IRAQI AMBASSADOR PROCLAIMS ALLAWI VISIT A SUCCESS 
 
REF: MANAMA 1228 
 
Classified By: CDA Susan Ziadeh, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C/NF) 1. SUMMARY: In an August 4 meeting with CDA, Iraqi 
Ambassador to Bahrain Ghassan Hussein stressed Bahrain\'s 
great show of solidarity with Iraq, a stance also underscored 
in positive GoB-sanctioned local media reports.  According to 
the Ambassador, Iraqi PM Allawi\'s unannounced seven-hour stop 
in Bahrain on August 2 was to discuss with the King and Prime 
Minister Bahrain\'s support for Iraq\'s security and stability 
through training and investment, while ministers in the 
delegation held bilateral meetings with their Bahraini 
counterparts.  Iraq and Bahrain continue to cooperate on 
finance training, and will add civil defense training soon. 
He noted that Bahrain may have backpedaled on a offer to send 
Bahraini Naval support, suggesting instead to provide 
training in Bahrain for Iraqi naval forces. The Ambassador 
concluded saying Bahrain and Iraq pledged to encourage 
private sector investment initiatives to support Iraq\'s 
reconstruction.  END SUMMARY. 
 
(C/NF)  2. Iraqi Ambassador to Bahrain Ghassan Hussein 
provided CDA with a read-out of the Allawi visit.  The Iraqi 
Ambassador said he capitalized on his 40-year friendship with 
his high school classmate Allawi to convince the Iraqi Prime 
Minister to visit Bahrain at the last minute.  The large 
Iraqi delegation included the Ministers of Defense, 
Transport, Telecommunications, Oil, and State as well as the 
Governor of the Central Bank (a regular visitor to Bahrain), 
the Assistant Director of Intelligence, the Deputy Foreign 
Minister and the Deputy Finance Minister.  Ambassador Hussein 
noted that members of the delegation held separate bilateral 
talks with their Bahraini counterparts, meetings not 
mentioned in press reports. 
 
(C/NF) 3. Ambassador Hussein said that the GOB is eager to 
provide assistance to Iraq, particularly in the form of 
training.  Bahrain has already begun providing financial 
sector training to Iraqi bankers, and he indicated that an 
MOU regarding training for 4000 Iraqi firefighters would soon 
be approved by the Iraqi Minister of Interior.  On security, 
Ambassador Hussein noted that the GOB may be rethinking 
sending naval forces to help secure Iraqi waters as offered 
one month ago, and is proposing instead to provide naval 
training in Bahrain for Iraqi naval forces.  While the 
Ambassador did not elaborate on Allawi\'s discussion with the 
King and Prime Minister for troop support (reftel), he 
reiterated Allawi\'s position that coalition forces must 
remain until Iraqi security capacities can be ensured.  Above 
all, Ambassador Hussein told CDA, Allawi stressed that Iraq 
needs continued moral support from Muslim countries and 
thanked Bahrain for its stance since the end of the old 
regime. 
 
(C/NF) 4. On economic issues, PM Allawi\'s message is that 
private investment is key to Iraq\'s reconstruction.  Iraq and 
Bahrain are organizing channels of bilateral commercial 
cooperation to provide potential Bahraini investors with the 
ways and means to get involved.  To encourage private sector 
interest, Iraq is sending its Minister of Water Resources, 
and possibly its Minister of Electricity to Bahrain in 
conjunction with the Power-Gen Middle East and Water Middle 
East Conference in September.

SUBJECT: 8,000 BAHRAINIS PEACEFULLY PROTEST US OPERATIONS 
IN IRAQI HOLY CITIES 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Bahrain\'s Shi\'a leadership organized a 
march in which 8,000 Bahrainis peacefully protested US 
military actions in Najaf and other holy cities of Iraq. 
Representing Parliament, Sunni Council of Representatives 
(COR) Chairman Ahmed Khalifa Al Dahrani issued a public 
statement expressing Parliament\'s concern for the \"brutal 
carnage\" in Iraqi cities. Prominent Shi\'a parliamentarians 
emphasized that Parliament\'s statement is a condemnation of 
all violence in Iraq, both coalition forces and Iraqi 
elements.  They reiterated that Bahraini Shi\'a do not support 
Muqtada Al Sadr and that his rise to prominence is only based 
on his father\'s laurels. While the protest and parliamentary 
statement are clearly expressions of Bahrainis\' concern for 
Iraqis, they also reflect a measure of local politics with 
Sunnis jumping on a popular Shi\'a bandwagon.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  On Friday August 13, approximately 8,000 Bahrainis 
(RSO estimate) marched in protest against US military actions 
in Najaf and other holy cities of Iraq. Organized by 
Bahrain\'s leading Shi\'a opposition society Al Wifaq, 
demonstrators walked the customary four kilometer course 
between the Seef and Pearl roundabouts following Friday 
sermons, chanting slogans demanding a halt to US military 
actions.  Hundreds of women protested separately on a nearby 
route.  Internet chatrooms called for a protest in front of 
the US Embassy which did not materialize.  Eyewitnesses and 
the press reported that the protests were peaceful and there 
were no reports of injuries, casualties or arrests.  A 
prominent Shi\'a Editor-in-Chief Mansour Al Jamri in his 
August 15 column in al-Wasat praised the police for their 
low-key presence at the demonstration. 
 
3.  (U)  Bahraini religious leaders made statements in both 
the English and Arabic local press on August 14.  Al Wifaq\'s 
President Shaikh Ali Salman stated that (US) occupiers of 
Iraq need to take full responsibility for the \"bloodshed of 
innocent civilians in Iraq.\" He added that the USG creates 
trouble in Iraq to ensure the continuity of its presence. 
Prominent religious Shi\'a clerics Shaikh Issa Qassim and 
Shaikh Abdulla Al-Guraifi publicly endorsed Salman\'s 
comments.  Sunni Parliamentarian and member of Al Minbar 
Islamiyya (Muslim Brotherhood) Shaikh Mohammed Khalid, who 
participated with Shaikh Salman in the protest, told the 
press that he wanted to send a clear message to the US 
administration that Bahraini Sunni and Shi\'a are united 
against US occupation and \"desecration\" of religious sites. 
 
4.  (C)  Sunni Chairman of the elected Council of 
Representatives (COR) Ahmed Khalifa Al Dahrani issued a 
public statement August 13 on behalf of the Parliament 
condemning the events in Iraq, expressing its concern for the 
\"brutal carnage\" Iraqi cities have experienced and that 
American forces have waged attacks in Najaf close to the Imam 
Ali shrine. In conversations with Shi\'a COR members, Shaikh 
Mohammed Al Abbas told PolOFF on August 14 that he was 
gratified to receive a call from Al Dahrani requesting a 
meeting of COR members to approve a public statement.  COR 
member Ali Samaheeji told PolOFF on August 14 that he was 
surprised that Al Dahrani took the initiative to support the 
Shi\'a, demonstrating that Al Dahrani is \"a man for all 
Bahrainis.\"  Both COR members claimed that all available 
Sunni and Shi\'a COR members agreed with the statement\'s 
content. 
 
5.  (C)  However, Shaikh Mohammed Al Abbas insisted that 
Parliament\'s statement was also a condemnation of all 
violence in Iraq, whether by coalition forces or Iraqi 
elements.  He added that the Shi\'a do not support Muqtada Al 
Sadr and that Al Sadr\'s rise to prominence is only based on 
his father\'s laurels and suffering.  \"Al Sadr set in motion a 
violence machine he can\'t control,\" Al Abbas said.  MP 
Samaheeji also said that Bahrain\'s religious clerics do not 
support Al Sadr and no one called for action in Bahrain in 
support of Al Sadr.  Yousif Zailalabedeen Zainal told PolOFF 
on August 14 that the Islamic Bloc of Parliament will meet 
with Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Mubarak Al 
Khalifa on August 16 to present a letter of concern 
protesting coalition troops fighting near Najaf\'s Imam Ali 
shrine. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT.  While the protest and parliamentary 
statement are clearly heartfelt expressions of Bahrainis\' 
concern for Iraqis, they also represent some measure of 
gamesmanship and local politics.  Perhaps out of concern for 
being outmaneuvered by Shaikh Salman and Al Wifaq, COR 
Chairman Al Dahrani took the initiative to issue a public 
statement against US operations in Najaf.  If this was his 
motivation, it appears to have worked: he has earned the 
appreciation of COR members who generally consider him a weak 
leader and the Prime Minister\'s man.  END COMMENT.

Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Charge held her initial meeting with Crown Prince 
(CP) Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa to discuss joint 
counter-terrorism efforts, the security situation and the 
status of the DOD Bahrain School.  They also covered the 
Saudi proposal for Muslim troops to Iraq and the U.S. global 
defense posture (septels.)  The Charge noted recent positive 
developments in the security situation, but urged continued 
attention to the issue.  The CP emphasized that he is seized 
with enhancing security in the country through improving the 
capabilities of and cooperation among the Bahraini security 
services.  They need to shift their focus to solid 
investigative work and obtaining evidence usable in court. 
The CP suggested there be greater efforts on the strategic 
level of the war on terrorism by addressing the core 
conditions that lead some young people in the region to turn 
to extremism.  Regarding the Bahrain School, the CP pledged 
to provide whatever assistance was needed, whether financial 
or in-kind. He takes our security concerns in Bahrain 
seriously, and he is pushing for systemic improvement.  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Enhancing Capabilities and Cooperation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Charge opened the meeting by noting the recent 
progress on security issues of bilateral concern and 
stressing the need for continued vigilance.  The CP commented 
that he was now feeling more confident about internal 
security and promised there would be additional developments 
over the next several weeks to reinforce progress already 
made.  He was focused on enhancing the capabilities of and 
cooperation between Bahrain\'s security forces so that they 
can maintain the safety and security of the country while not 
exceeding the limits of the law.  The Charge stated that the 
GOB has to ensure that individuals, local and foreign, are 
not in a position to threaten the security of the country. 
The CP, in an implicit criticism of the Bahraini security 
apparatus, said that inadequate information sharing and 
reliance upon certain sources of information could lead to 
faulty decisions, and that he was working on correcting this. 
 Bahrain needs a \"robust\" intelligence system that is capable 
of conducting thorough investigations and developing solid 
evidence to be used in court.  In the past, the security 
services relied upon old national security laws to gain 
convictions and now they must learn new techniques to obtain 
more usable evidence.  The CP indicated he has been working 
directly with the new Minister of Interior who is focused on 
enhancing U.S.-Bahraini cooperation and building the 
capabilities of the ministry. 
 
3.  (C) The Crown Prince said that the war on terrorism was 
being fought tactically in Najaf, Bahrain, and Pakistan, but 
that there needed to be greater focus on the strategic level; 
that is, addressing the reasons that some young Muslims are 
attracted to extremism.  The major determining factors on 
this level are success in Iraq and U.S. involvement in the 
Arab-Israeli conflict.  He stated that the Palestinians must 
renounce terrorism as a political tool and Israel must 
dismantle settlements.  He commented that the Arab-Israeli 
conflict is the single issue that has most changed Muslims\' 
perceptions of the United States over the years.  With regard 
to the conflict, the CP noted that the Arab street believes 
the United States speaks with clarity, but not with moral 
authority. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Offer to Assist Security at School 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The CP asked about the status of the DOD Bahrain 
School.  The Charge noted that an announcement would likely 
be made the next day.  The Crown Prince said that he has a 
personal interest in it because his children attend the 
school and he is an alumni.  He also indicated that the 
school is central to our bilateral relationship and serves as 
a source for democracy and political opening in Bahrain.  The 
Charge made reference to her previous meeting with Foreign 
Minister Mohamed bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, during which the 
Minister offered financial assistance to the school, if 
needed, to ensure the Bahrain School reopened.  In 
particular, the Charge mentioned the need to provide security 
for school teachers at their residences, among other possible 
requirements.  The CP replied that the GOB would provide 
\"whatever you need.\"  The Charge thanked him and promised to 
get back to him with a specific request. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C) The Crown Prince went to great lengths to reassure us 
that he and the GOB fully understand our security concerns in 
Bahrain and that he shares them.  He expressed reservations 
about the previous methods of the Bahraini security services 
and emphasized his intention to improve their practices and 
coordination.  He appears to have received our message about 
getting on top of the security situation in Bahrain.  We will 
continue to watch closely the efforts of the GOB to improve 
their CT capacities and, more importantly, monitor the impact 
of those efforts.  End Comment.

1.  (S) Charge presented Refs A and B talking points on the 
U.S. global defense posture review to Crown Prince (CP) 
Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa August 15 during a meeting 
that also covered joint counter-terrorism efforts, the 
security situation, and the Saudi proposal for Muslim troops 
to Iraq (septels). The CP is also the Commander of the 
Bahrain Defense Force. In presenting the points, the Charge 
underscored that United States relations with our allies will 
remain steadfast and we seek their input and close 
coordination. 
 
2.  (S) The CP responded that the U.S. and Bahrain have a 
long history of shared strategic military objectives and a 
mutually beneficial mil-mil relationship.  He noted that 
prior to the first Gulf War, the United States conducted its 
regional military operations out of Bahrain and Oman, and 
only branched out to other Gulf countries during and after 
the run-up to the war.  He cautioned about the U.S. changing 
its strategic relations with countries in the region, 
particularly as it relates to economic security, protecting 
the transport of oil from the region. 
 
3.  (S) The Crown Prince stressed the importance the Gulf 
countries place on their relationships and partnerships with 
the United States.  Although steady cultivation of 
relationships may not be the most efficient way of doing 
business, it is the most politically sound and effective way 
in this part of the world.  Maintaining the stability of U.S. 
military assets in the region is the best means to ensure 
flexibility in the use of those assets.  While not 
specifically citing Bahrain, the CP said that military 
build-ups at Forward Operating Sites may not be guaranteed in 
the heat of a crisis because host governments may have to 
make extremely sensitive political calculations to permit the 
entry of new troops and materiel.  By contrast, mobilization 
of assets already in place is a much easier and 
straightforward decision.  In closing, the Crown Prince asked 
that we let him know if there are any Bahrain-specific ideas 
under consideration.  The Charge assured him that we would 
continue to consult with him and the GOB as this process 
unfolds.

1.  (S) Charge presented Ref A talking points on the U.S. 
thoughts on the Saudi proposal for Muslim troops to Iraq to 
Crown Prince (CP) Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa August 
15 during a meeting that also covered joint counter-terrorism 
efforts, the security situation, and the U.S. global defense 
posture (septels).  The CP is also the Commander of the 
Bahrain Defense Force (BDF). 
 
2.  (S) The Crown Prince asserted that Bahrain would 
contribute troops to a Muslim force for Iraq if there was a 
GCC decision to form such a force.  Echoing previous comments 
by Foreign Minister Mohamed bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa to the 
Charge (Ref B), he continued that Bahrain would support the 
force once the political pieces fell into place.  In response 
to the Charge\'s question, the CP said that Bahrain could not 
contribute troops independent of a GCC mission because the 
BDF was too small and could not provide the level of support 
necessary to carry out a mission in Iraq, specifically citing 
logistic and force protection requirements.  He noted that 
Bahrain had dispatched forces to Kuwait at the beginning of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom at the request of the GOK, and the 
Kuwaitis had provided all the support these troops had needed. 
 
3.  (S) The Crown Prince raised an offer previously mentioned 
by King Hamad bin Issa Al-Khalifa in conversations with 
National Security Advisor Rice and Iraqi Prime Minister 
Allawi to deploy a naval vessel to provide protection along 
the Iraqi coastline.  The CP highlighted that deployment of a 
ship is a stand-alone operation without the extensive support 
requirements that land-based troops would require.  The GOB 
was waiting for a formal request from Iraq for the ship 
before proceeding with the deployment.

2.  (C) The Charge met with Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Dr. Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar to discuss the status of 
Bahrain\'s counter-terrorism law, recent press articles on 
legal cases concerning detainees at Guantanamo, and other 
issues (septels).  Abdul Ghaffar said that he could not pass 
us a copy of the draft CT law because it was still under 
review by the cabinet.  He said it was modeled on UN and 
other international CT conventions.  He noted that the 
cabinet had not yet decided whether the law would be 
presented to parliament as a stand-alone bill or as an 
amendment to the existing criminal code.  The Charge 
emphasized that the United States would continue to work 
closely with Bahrain to combat local, regional, and 
transnational threats to Bahrain\'s security.  Regarding 
Guantanamo, Abdul Ghaffar noted that British lawyers had 
received permission from the U.S. Supreme Court to visit 
their (British) clients, and the attorneys representing the 
Bahraini detainees reportedly planned to seek similar 
authorization.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
CT Law Still With Cabinet 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The Charge opened her August 18 meeting with Minister 
of State for Foreign Affairs Abdul Ghaffar by asking about 
the Minister\'s recent visit to Washington, noting that he had 
offered to deliver a copy of the draft Bahraini 
counter-terrorism law to us during his meeting with S/CT 
Ambassador Black.  Abdul Ghaffar said that he had a very 
productive visit to Washington, and felt that the United 
States and Bahrain were working closely together to identify 
CT issues and share information.  He said that we were facing 
the challenge of terrorism together. 
 
4.  (C) Regarding the law, Abdul Ghaffar stated that it was 
still with the cabinet, and he was unable to give us a copy 
until the cabinet had received input and approval from the 
relevant ministries. He assured the Charge that the United 
States would be happy with the law, saying it was based upon 
UN and other international CT conventions, such as the Arab 
and GCC agreements on combating terrorism.  He said the 
cabinet was still unsure whether it would propose the law as 
a stand-alone bill or as an amendment to the existing 
criminal code.  He noted that gaining parliamentary approval 
for the law would be sensitive, and that the GOB was 
preparing the ground by stressing that a world-class CT law 
was in Bahrain\'s national interest, and that any shortcomings 
would be harmful to Bahrain\'s future. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Continued Vigilance Combating Terrorism 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Charge pointed out that terrorist threats can 
emanate from local, regional, and transnational sources.  She 
said that the United States and countries in the region had 
suffered greatly from terrorism, and the United States, like 
the government of Bahrain, wants to be certain that Bahrain 
does not suffer from this scourge.  She pledged our support, 
cooperation and assistance to ensure that the GOB is on top 
of any challenges to the country\'s security.  Abdul Ghaffar 
responded that Bahrain would remain vigilant and continue to 
cooperate with the U.S. and other friendly countries on CT 
initiatives.  He assured the Charge that there was no 
daylight between the positions of the GOB and the United

strong CT law would enable the GOB to take firm action 
against any elements seeking to disrupt the security 
situation in the country and maintain rule of law.

Attorney Access to Gitmo Detainees? 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar related that he had read an article in 
the August 18 edition of Al-Wasat newspaper reporting that 
British lawyers had obtained U.S. Supreme Court authorization 
to meet with their (British) clients, detainees at 
Guantanamo.  The article continued that attorneys from the 
firm Dorsey and Whitney, who represent Bahraini detainees, 
would be requesting similar authorization over the next few 
days.  Abdul Ghaffar indicated that he would undoubtedly be 
asked to follow up on this, and he requested an update from 
us so that he could accurately portray the current 
state-of-play. 
 
7.  (C) Action Request:  Embassy requests information that we 
can share with Abdul Ghaffar on the status of legal cases 
concerning attorney access to Gitmo detainees. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar clearly understands that both the 
United States and Bahrain have a strong national interest in 
maintaining a stable security environment in Bahrain.  In 
recognition of political reality, he is keeping one eye on 
the legislative hurdles the GOB will face when it presents 
the law to parliament for passage.  The timing and form of 
the law as it is presented to parliament, and the 
government\'s efforts to gain passage, will bear watching as 
the GOB moves to get on top of the domestic security 
situation.  We will continue to seek a copy of the draft law.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  Bahrain experienced a nationwide blackout that lasted 
up to 15 hours in some neighborhoods.  Minister of 
Electricity and Water (MEW) Shaikh Abdullah bin Salman Khalid 
Al Khalifa attributed the blackout to an unexpected massive 
power surge from the nation\'s aluminum manufacturer ALBA. 
Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa publicly called 
for an immediate investigation, and angry parliamentarians 
demanded a special session to discuss the issue.  Security 
forces dispersed throughout populated areas to maintain 
public security and direct traffic.  Despite intense heat and 
humidity, there were no reports of any blackout-related crime 
or disturbances.  Hospitals reported that they were able to 
operate intensive and critical care units and emergency 
departments.  The press reports an estimate of BD 10 million 
($27 million) in economic losses from the one day 
interruption to normal work schedules.  Senior government 
officials in the past have noted to us the increasing strain 
on the power system, and the GOB will have to deal with 
inevitable questions from potential investors about the 
infrastructure capacity as it seeks to promote Bahrain as an 
investment destination.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Power Surge Causes Blackout 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  On August 23rd, Bahrain experienced a nationwide 
blackout that started at 8 AM and lasted up to 15 hours in 
some neighborhoods. Most businesses and government agencies 
shut down by 10 AM.  On a day that reached nearly 50 degrees 
Centigrade and 90 percent humidity, many Bahrainis sought 
refuge from the heat by driving over the causeway to eastern 
Saudi Arabia while others flew to Dubai. A few retail outlets 
known to have back-up generators experienced a huge surge in 
business as Bahrainis piled into establishments like 
McDonalds and the Jawad and Al Osra supermarkets.  At Jawad, 
families with overheated babies lingered in the frozen foods 
section.  Other Bahrainis clogged roadways by driving around 
the island in their air-conditioned cars. Some citizens ran 
out of gas while trying to keep cool because only four gas 
stations were operational.  Traffic lights were out and there 
were reports of minor car accidents, including an unfortunate 
collision involving a truck carrying a large delivery of 
fresh eggs.  Domestic telephone landlines remained 
operational but cellular networks were jammed. Two-thirds of 
Bahrain\'s water supply was cut off because there was no 
electricity to power the country\'s desalination plants. 
 
3.  (SBU)  A MEW official told FSN on August 24 that the 
blackout was due to a 400MW power surge from the ALBA 
aluminum smelter during routine maintenance of a production 
line. The official refuted widespread rumors that the 
blackout came as a result of maintenance problems at the Hidd 
power plant or due to a fire at the Manama power station.  In 
a July 27 explanation about recent rolling brownouts (Ref A), 
the Electricity Minister explained to Charge that the power 
distribution network, designed to accommodate a 20 percent 
load increase, has had to service an 80 percent growth in 
demand over the past three years. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Police Report No Blackout-Related Incidents 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  The Bahrain Defense Force, Coast Guard, and police 
stepped up the pace of their operations, and 100 public 
security personnel immediately mobilized to support the 
traffic directorate in controlling the flow of vehicles in 
the absence of traffic lights.  Security contacts report that 
as the day went on, police had reduced communications ability 
because the batteries on their radios wore down.  Airport 
contacts confirmed on August 24 that the Bahrain 
International Airport remained fully operational during the 
blackout.  Some flights were delayed but none were canceled. 
The intensive and critical care units and emergency rooms at 
all major hospitals remained open, though they had to turn 
away non-emergency cases.  Hospitals did experience problems 
with crowd control because an overwhelming number of people 
without medical emergencies showed up to sit in 
air-conditioned ER waiting rooms.  The Saudis ran electrical 
wires to the Bahraini side of the causeway to ensure that 
immigration, customs and security operations were not 
interrupted.  There were no reports of blackout-related 
crimes or disturbances. 
------------------------------------------ 
MPs Promote Special Session to Investigate 
------------------------------------------ 
5.  (C)  In response to the blackout, the Prime Minister 
convened an emergency Cabinet meeting on August 23 and 
ordered an immediate inquiry into the blackout and formed an 
investigative committee.  Council of Representatives (COR) 
First Vice Chairman Abdulhadi Marhoon called for convening a 
special session of Parliament to discuss electricity and 
water cuts, which have become more frequent in recent years. 
Over 15 members of Parliament met and agreed to form an 
investigative committee.  Shura Council First Vice Chairman 
Abdulrahman Jamsheer told FSN and PolOFF on August 23 that he 
expects the Minister of Electricity and Water to be fired. 
Al Minbar (Sunni) member MP Shaikh Mohammed Khalid Mohammed 
accused the GOB of not planning for emergencies and warned 
that this lack of planning affects critical sectors of the 
economy.  Islamic Bloc (Shi\'a) President and MP Ali Samaheeji 
told PolOFF on August 24 that these power outages affect all 
Bahrainis, but Shi\'a even more so.  He noted that Sunni 
areas, particularly the central Rifaa district that houses 
the royal family and a number of government ministries, had 
its power restored within a few hours while predominantly 
Shi\'a areas in the north and west had to wait until 10 PM or 
later until the electricity flowed again.  Others noted that 
following the blackout, Sunni and Shi\'a were united in their 
misery because previously, during the rolling brownouts, only 
the poor Shi\'a areas were affected. 
 
6.  (U)  In contrast with the anodyne official news reports, 
Radio Bahrain disc jockeys kept the English speaking public 
informed of developments by passing on reports from listeners 
about when the power was restored to parts of the country. 
Embassy local staff reported that the Electricity Ministry 
complaints and information hotline was constantly busy.  Only 
after power was fully restored to all areas did the MEW 
Minister hold a late night press conference to explain to 
journalists the cause of the blackout.  In his August 24 
press release, the Prime Minister expressed the GOB\'s regrets 
for any inconvenience caused by the blackout. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Economic Losses, and Damaged Reputation 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) The press reported that the blackout caused BD 10 
million ($27 million) in economic losses.  A front-page 
article stated that Bahrain,s banks, a source of economic 
growth and national pride, faced delays of up to four hours 
in their international operations.  A source at the Ministry 
of Finance and National Economy told us that at this point it 
was impossible to quantify accurately the economic losses, 
but the GOB would conduct investigations to arrive at an 
estimate.  The press noted that the business community 
supports the investigations.  One banking contact told us 
that his office had to close by noon, leading to financial 
losses and lost opportunities in a sector characterized by 
activity 24/7.  Others were too busy to comment, saying that 
the loss of a workday caused an extraordinary queue of 
transactions the following day, August 24. 
 
8.   (SBU) The blackout highlighted a gap between Bahrain,s 
aspirations to become a regional center for finance, 
insurance, education, health care, and other services, and 
the necessary infrastructure to support such development. 
Bahrain seeks to leverage a Free Trade Agreement with the 
U.S. to attract more foreign direct investment and to promote 
its reputation as a regional services center.  The blackout 
could lead to embarrassing questions regarding the country\'s 
ability to support more investment.  Representatives of 
American firms in country had mixed assessments of the impact 
of the blackout.  One said the net result was just \"disrupted 
business and an unproductive day,\" while another said that 
the incident was the \"harvest of years of poor planning\" and 
would cause \"big firms to ask questions\" about Bahrain as an 
investment destination.  Minister of Finance and National 
Economy Abdullah Saif told the Shura Council in April the 
growth in demand for power requires the state to invest in 
new power facilities every two to three years, and the GOB 
has to prepare itself for this. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
9.  (C) Though the blackout harmed Bahrain and its 
government\'s reputation politically and economically, what is 
perhaps most noteworthy is what did not happen.  Despite the 
heat, humidity, heavy traffic, and crowds, there was no 
breakdown in public order or blackout-related incidents. 
Possibly reflecting consensus that \"we\'re all in this 
together,\" family groups waiting out the day inside the food 
court next to the Jawad supermarket reconfigured the tables 
into impromptu \"majleses,\" where citizens expressed their 
views.  Perhaps the blackout may result in greater government 
responsiveness to repeated Shi\'a complaints about the impact 
of rolling brownouts on their lives.  It would seem that 
Bahrain\'s Sunni and Shi\'a alike, will not accept another 
iteration of the lack of planning that they believe led to 
yesterday\'s power failure.  Already calls have begun for 
greater government accountability and action.  End Comment.

ECONOMY WITH CROWN PRINCE 
 
Classified by DCM Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Codel Miller met with Crown Prince Shaikh Salman bin 
Hamad Al Khalifa August 22 and discussed the domestic 
security situation, status of counter-terrorism laws in 
Bahrain, Iraq, the military confrontation in Najaf, U.S. 
public outreach efforts in the Middle East, Arab-Israeli 
relations, Afghanistan, the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA), the domestic economy, and the U.S. Navy presence in 
Bahrain.  The Crown Prince repeatedly stressed the strength 
of the long-standing U.S.-Bahrain bilateral relationship, 
noting that both countries had benefited from it.  He spoke 
of enhancing intelligence cooperation, trade and investment 
relations via the FTA, and the importance of personnel 
contacts in furthering the mil-mil relationship.  Regarding 
Iraq, he counseled American steadfastness in facing down its 
enemies there and offered specific suggestions to improve the 
situation on the ground.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Representative Jeff Miller (R-FL) led a bipartisan 
congressional delegation to Bahrain August 22-23 composed of 
Representatives John Boozman (R-AR), Madeleine Bordallo 
(D-Guam), Tom Cole (R-OK), Jim Marshall (D-GA), and Adam 
Schiff (D-CA), House Armed Services staff members Michael 
Higgins and Mark Lewis, and military escorts LTC Richard 
Simcock and GySgt Lorenzo Chance.  The CODEL met with Crown 
Prince Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Bahrain Defense 
Force Chief of Staff Major General Shaikh Mohammed bin 
Abdullah Al Khalifa, the Embassy country team, NAVCENT 
officials, and overnighted on the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy in 
the Persian Gulf.  The Charge and Pol/Econ chief (notetaker) 
attended the meeting with the Crown Prince. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Enhanced Intelligence Cooperation with U.S. 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Representative Miller opened the meeting by thanking 
Bahrain for its support for and long-standing relationship 
with the United States.  He briefed the Crown Prince on the 
CODEL\'s travels and invited his colleagues to raise any 
issues of concern.  The CP welcomed the group and expressed 
his condolences for the recent loss of life in Florida due to 
Hurricane Charley.  Representative Schiff asked about the 
threat of terrorism in Bahrain.  The CP noted that there are 
individuals with the capacity to carry out attacks anywhere 
in the world and all countries are vulnerable.  In an oblique 
reference to the six Bahrainis arrested in mid-July, he said 
that when the United States and Bahrain share information, 
they can build robust cases against those individuals 
threatening the public order.  He stressed that Bahrain wants 
to enhance its intelligence cooperation with the U.S. 
 
4.  (C) Turning to threats from the outside, the CP said that 
maintaining stability and unity in Iraq would have a positive 
influence throughout the region and the world.  The best way 
to reach Muslims\' \"hearts and minds\" is to achieve liberty 
and freedom in Iraq and help broker an equitable solution 
between Arabs and Israelis. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
New CT Law to Address Terrorist Threat 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Representative Bordallo asked about Bahrain\'s 
counter-terrorism laws.  The CP said that the problem is the 
weakness of Bahrain\'s existing conspiracy law.  It was 
written to address the planning of crimes and stipulates a 
maximum penalty of three years in prison.  This is inadequate 
for use against terrorists, who seek to cause mass 
casualties, and the country is developing a new conspiracy 
law to address this kind of threat.  Regarding the case of 
the six Bahrainis, he said that they are behind bars and are 
\"not going anywhere.\" 
 
----------------------- 
Stable Iraq Free of WMD 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Following up on the topic of Iraq, Representative 
Cole requested the CP\'s advice on how the U.S. should proceed 
there.  The CP replied that America\'s actions must be 
determined by its objectives.  If the U.S. really wants a 
free democracy in Iraq, it must consider the possibility that 
Iraq could become an Islamic republic.  The CP commented that 
he believes the U.S. objective is a stable Iraq free of 
weapons of mass destruction.  In this case, the Iraqi 
government should halt the de-Baathification process, which 
is viewed by many as a process to settle personal vendettas. 
Rather, the Iraqi government should identify the real 
criminals and prosecute them, but issue a general amnesty for 
everyone else, as was done in South Africa, Ireland, and even 
in Bahrain in the 2002 constitution. 
7.  (C) Second, the U.S. should support the development of 
the Iraqi civilian defense force so that Al Sadr and other 
\"jihadists\" do not fill the vacuum created by the dissolution 
of the Iraqi Army.  Finally, the CP stated that the United 
States must steadfastly support its troops on the ground so 
they can get the job done. 
 
8.  (C) Representative Marshall noted that damaging or 
destroying the Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf could become an 
anti-American rallying point for our enemies.  The Crown 
Prince said that U.S. and Iraqi forces should avoid 
destroying the shrine at all cost.  However, Muslims would 
eventually get over some inadvertent damage to it as a result 
of a military operation.  He noted that in 1979, when 
radicals occupied the mosque in Mecca, the Saudi army ran a 
tank through the main door and settled the problem. 
 
9.  (C) Marshall said that the U.S. position would be 
improved by voices in the region speaking publicly in support 
of the United States.  The CP replied that Iraqis should 
speak up before others in the region do so.  He noted that 
the issue of influencing Arab public opinion was being 
discussed in Washington and recommended the U.S. focus its 
activities on populous \"anchor states\" in the region such as 
Egypt and Morocco. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Israel\'s Controversial Settlement Policy 
---------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Returning to his theme of enhancing security 
throughout the region, the Crown Prince said that the Arab 
street considered Israeli settlement building to be the most 
controversial issue in Israeli-Palestinian relations.  He 
conjectured that Prime Minister Sharon wants to withdraw from 
Gaza to focus on strengthening the settlement infrastructure 
in the West Bank.  Rather than pursuing such a contentious 
policy, Israel could be working with friendly Arabs (like 
Bahrain) to counter true threats, such as Iranian missiles 
capable of striking Israel and other countries in the region. 
 He asserted that he has no sympathy for Arafat, who is a 
problem, and that both the Israeli and Palestinian 
leaderships had demonstrated no real will to address the 
fundamental differences between them. 
 
11.  (C) Referencing the Codel\'s travels, the CP said that in 
Afghanistan, it appeared that the security situation was more 
stable in larger areas of the country.  Stating that a 
growing economy would lead to a more stable security 
situation, he suggested that the United States and other 
developed countries grant trade preferences for Afghanistan\'s 
agricultural exports and signal their support for the passage 
of oil pipelines through Afghan territory. 
 
----------------------------- 
Diversify Economy Through FTA 
----------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Representative Boozman questioned the CP about 
Bahrain\'s expectations related to the U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement.  He replied that stability and security are driven 
by economic opportunity and growth, and the FTA will permit 
Bahrain to seize the day and develop a stronger economy.  In 
response to Representative Marshall\'s follow up question on 
the long-term future of Bahrain\'s economy, the Crown Prince 
said that currently Bahrain\'s engines of economic growth are 
petroleum, finance, manufacturing based upon low-cost natural 
gas, tourism, information technology and other business 
services, and government.  He looks forward to the day when 
the roles of the government and petroleum sector in the 
economy are reduced.  He recalled the advice of a Singaporean 
visitor, who said that small nations must produce high 
quality products, be adaptable, attract new businesses, and 
\"their vision cannot be constrained by their size.\"  He 
commented that he wants the standard of living of all 
citizens to improve as a result of enhanced U.S. trade and 
investment relations via the FTA, and not just the 2,000 
wealthy, plugged-in business people. 
 
13.  (C) To close the meeting, Representative Miller asked 
about the status of the DOD-run Bahrain School.  The Crown 
Prince responded that the school is an excellent ambassador 
for the United States in Bahrain, and it will produce the 
next generation of political and business leaders in the 
country.  In addition, it forges personal links between 
Bahrainis and Americans.  In this regard, the CP mentioned 
that stable relationships are particularly important in 
military affairs.  In an unstated reference to the U.S. 
global defense posture review, he said that Bahrain and the 
U.S. Navy had enjoyed great results from their 50-year 
relationship.  Navy personnel had lived and worked side by 
side with Bahrainis, and when they needed each other, they 
stood together.  The U.S. has always understood the 
importance of building relationships and should continue to 
do so into the future.

two hours from the time they walk in to apply for the visa 
to the time they walk out with their visas in hand. 
 
2.  Although Post does not have an appointment system, the 
Consular Section realizes the importance of facilitating 
business travel and has taken steps towards further 
expediting the process for these travelers.  In connection 
with the American Chamber of Commerce and the American 
Association of Bahrain (local American business group), the 
Consular Section offers special services and priority 
appointments to business travelers from these groups. 
 
3.   Members forward their applications to be reviewed and 
data-entered, which ensures that documentation is complete 
and saves approximately half an hour on the day of the 
interview.  Applicants are given an appointment, and on the 
interview date, they do not wait in the regular application 
line.  The back-up NIV officer interviews and adjudicates 
the case and the applicant may then leave and pick up the 
visa later or may wait 15 minutes for printing.  The whole 
process takes less than half an hour. 
 
4.  Post\'s conoff also attends board meetings and other 
events of the country\'s main business groups, and 
coordinates with the Economic/Commercial Section on both 
routine and official business travel.  The Consular Section 
regularly schedules block appointments for conference and 
seminar participants and provides VIP appointments during 
non-public hours for Embassy referrals.  The section also 
provides priority processing for government delegations, 
like those attending U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement 
negotiations and IMF/World Bank sessions. 
 
5.  The Consular Section continues to provide the most 
efficient level of service to the business community and 
welcomes further Department initiatives and developments 
aimed at supporting and facilitating business travel.

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI CABINET APPROVES DRAFT FTA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) On August 29 the Bahraini Cabinet approved the current 
draft of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United 
States.  Press reports on the Council,s decision followed a 
familiar refrain, highlighting the FTA\'s economic benefits, 
particularly the potential for job creation, as well as 
duty-free access to the U.S. market for goods produced or 
\"substantially transformed\" in Bahrain, including textiles 
and 96 percent of agricultural and manufactured goods.  The 
Cabinet also formally delegated authority to the Minister of 
Finance and National Economy Abdullah Saif to sign the 
agreement. 
 
2. (C) During the Ambassador,s August 30 call on Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar (septel), 
Ghaffar confirmed Minister Saif will visit Washington in 
mid-September to sign the FTA with USTR Zoellick.  The 
Bahraini Embassy in Washington now has an economic officer, 
Dr. Nasser Belooshi, to work on FTA implementation and 
identify ways that Bahrain can benefit from the FTA.  The GOB 
wants to encourage development of the private sector. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  While the Cabinet\'s approval was expected, 
the GOB has used its seal of approval to again send a strong 
message that the FTA offers real opportunities and tangible 
benefits to Bahrainis.  Expectations are high and as the 
signing nears the Embassy will continue to work closely with 
GOB officials and Washington agencies on implementation 
strategies.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Ambassador paid an introductory call on Minister 
of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar August 30 
to discuss priority issues in the bilateral relationship. 
Regarding the security situation in Bahrain, the Ambassador, 
stating that he had learned that the judge had granted a 
15-day rather than 45-day extension to the detention of the 
six terrorism suspects, stressed the importance of continuing 
to hold them.  Otherwise, there would be a strong impact and 
reaction in Washington.  Abdul Ghaffar said that he was under 
pressure to take action on the Bahraini detainees at 
Guantanamo and indicated that the GOB would soon forward an 
official letter to the USG requesting a visit by the Bahraini 
security team and parents of the detainees to Guantanamo.  On 
Article 98, the GOB was still evaluating its options on 
dealing with parliament, and he asked for information on the 
number of GCC and regional countries that had already 
ratified the agreement.  Finally, Abdul Ghaffar reported that 
the Cabinet had approved the draft text of the U.S. Free 
Trade Agreement, and the GOB was looking for ways to show 
that the close bilateral relationship could lead to an 
improved standard of living for all Bahrainis.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Stable Security Situation Promotes Business 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul 
Ghaffar August 30 welcomed the Ambassador to Bahrain and 
congratulated him on his assignment.  Abdul Ghaffar expressed 
his appreciation for the USG lifting the travel warning and 
authorized departure for Embassy dependents, and was pleased 
that the DOD Bahrain School would open for the school year 
the next day.  The Ambassador replied that the school was an 
important aspect of the United States presence in Bahrain and 
would play a major role in marketing Bahrain as a destination 
for foreign investment.  The upcoming free trade agreement 
would highlight Bahrain as an open, transparent economy, but 
American citizens would want to know that there was a fully 
accredited school in country for their children. 
 
3.  (C) In that regard, the Ambassador noted that the GOB 
must continue to be vigilant on security and 
counter-terrorism to guarantee that Bahrain was a safe place 
to do business.  The status of the six terrorism suspects is 
a point of great concern.  There was much satisfaction in 
Washington with their re-arrest and the subsequent legal 
procedures.  This led to the lifting of the travel warning 
and the authorized departure and the opening of the school. 
The GOB should interpret these steps as a reflection of our 
appreciation for the measures taken. 
 
4.  (C) In that connection, the Ambassador stated that he had 
learned that the judge had granted a 15-day, not 45-day, 
extension to the detention of the suspects.  He did not know 
the reasoning behind the limitation of the extension to 15 
days.  However, he noted that according to Bahraini laws, the 
GOB can hold suspects while it builds a case against them. 
It should do so.  Otherwise, the impact and reaction in 
Washington would be strong. 
 
5.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar said that he hoped there was sufficient 
evidence to continue to hold the suspects.  He said he had 
spoken with Minister of Interior Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah 
Al Khalifa about the issue following the August 29 Cabinet 
meeting, and he would follow up with the Minister over the 
coming week.  The Ambassador recalled that Crown Prince 
Salman had reassured the Charge and Codel Miller over the 
past two weeks that the detainees would remain in custody 
(Refs A and C), and the Ambassador expected that would be the 
case. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Request Coming for Fourth Gitmo Visit 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar noted that he was under pressure from 
the families of Bahraini prisoners in Guantanamo to take 
formal action.  He said that the GOB would soon forward an 
official letter to the USG requesting a fourth visit to Gitmo 
for the Bahraini security team, and this time the GOB would 
ask permission for parents of the detainees to accompany the 
team.  He indicated that parents of Australian detainees at 
Gitmo had previously been allowed to visit, and the Bahraini 
parents were requesting similar access.  Abdul Ghaffar said 
that such a step would ease domestic pressure on the GOB and 
improve the USG\'s reputation in country. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Concern About Publicity On Article 98 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador asked about progress in finalizing the 
Article 98 agreement.  Abdul Ghaffar replied that the GOB was 
deeply concerned about moving the agreement to ratification 
through the parliament.  He said that many Islamic deputies 
would vigorously object to the GOB signing the agreement.  He 
noted that the entire GOB, from King Hamad down, firmly 
supported signing the agreement and pledged not to deliver 
any American citizen, civilian or military, to a third 
country for prosecution, regardless of the existence of an 
agreement.  The Ambassador noted that it might be possible to 
conclude the agreement through an exchange of diplomatic 
notes that legally bind the two governments.  Abdul Ghaffar 
did not think such a mechanism would work in Bahrain because 
the government would have to answer questions from the 
parliament if word of the agreement ever leaked.  He asked 
about the number of GCC and other regional countries that had 
ratified the agreement already.  He wondered how they handled 
their parliaments, and if the GOB could learn from their 
experiences.  The government would not be reticent about 
speaking publicly in favor of the agreement if it could point 
to other countries that had already ratified it. 
 
--------------------------- 
Demonstrate Benefits of FTA 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The Minister informed the Ambassador that the Cabinet 
had approved the draft text of the U.S. Free Trade Agreement 
at its August 29 meeting (septel).  He commented that the GOB 
had to demonstrate to Bahrainis that they could benefit 
economically from the bilateral relationship with the United 
States.  Most Bahrainis think of the U.S. only as a military 
superpower and there had not been enough focus on United 
States leadership on economic and social issues.  Many 
American companies have invested or established regional 
offices in Bahrain - Citibank, Merrill Lynch, American 
Express, ALCOA - and the large majority of their employees 
are Bahrainis.  In contrast with the military relationship, 
which has little impact on the average man on the street, 
enhanced trade and investment relations as a result of the 
FTA had the potential to improve the country\'s overall 
standard of living.

COUNTER-TERRORISM LAW, DISCUSSES SECURITY SITUATION IN 
AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY CALL 
 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) The Ambassador paid an introductory call September 1 
on Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed bin Ibrahim Al 
Mutawwa and discussed Bahrain\'s draft counter-terrorism law, 
bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation and the six terrorism 
suspects, U.S. influence in the Arab world, Saudi Arabia, 
Iraq, democracy, and bilateral economic ties.  Al Mutawwa 
passed the Ambassador a copy of Bahrain\'s draft 
counter-terrorism law, which the Cabinet has approved and 
will deliver to parliament in early October when the next 
session begins.  The Ambassador urged the GOB to keep the six 
suspects in prison while the prosecution builds a case 
against them.  He said that he and Washington officials had 
serious concerns about the suspects, and the U.S. reaction 
would be very strong if they were released.  Al Mutawwa said 
that the GOB needed hard evidence against the six to keep 
them in custody and requested our assistance in collecting 
evidence.  He told the Ambassador that he would urge the 
Prime Minister to meet with the Ambassador soon to discuss 
this issue.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Draft CT Law Delivered 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed bin Ibrahim Al 
Mutawwa September 1 welcomed the Ambassador to Bahrain and 
assured him that he would find Bahrainis at all levels of 
society to be very open with him.  He commented on the 
strength of our bilateral relations and said the two 
countries were poised to take major steps, particularly 
signing the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  In the 
context of enhancing bilateral cooperation, Al Mutawwa passed 
the Ambassador a copy of the draft counter-terrorism law in 
Arabic.  He said that the Cabinet had approved the text of 
the law and that the draft would be delivered to parliament 
at the opening of the next session, in early October.  He 
hoped it would become law by the end of the year.  Al Mutawwa 
said that the Cabinet had not yet decided whether to present 
the law as an amendment to the existing criminal code or as 
new legislation.  In any case, the substance would be the 
same.  The drafters used a recent UK counter-terrorism law as 
the basis for the Bahraini draft.  (Note:  Embassy is 
reviewing the draft and developing an executive summary. 
Embassy will forward full Arabic text to NEA/ARPI.  End Note.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Serious Concerns About Terrorism Suspects 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) The Ambassador stated that he had spent the summer in 
Washington working on security-related issues with a focus on 
the case of the six terrorism suspects.  He said that 
U.S.-Bahrain cooperation has been excellent, and the U.S. is 
pleased with Bahrain\'s steps related to the CT draft law and 
the development of a CT Operations Center.  He noted that he 
had been able to point to the many positive measures the GOB 
had taken when arguing to lift the travel warning and Embassy 
authorized departure, and to keep the DOD Bahrain School 
open.  He indicated, however, that he was concerned about the 
status of the six detainees.  He had learned that the 
Bahraini judge had decided to extend their detention for just 
15 days rather than 45 days, as the prosecutor had requested. 
 The Ambassador emphasized that they must remain in prison 
while prosecutors and investigators built a case against 
them.  The Ambassador stated that he and Washington officials 
had serious concerns about the suspects, and the U.S. 
reaction would be very strong if they were released. 
 
4.  (C) The Minister said that security was Bahrain\'s top 
priority.  The GOB understands that terrorists can attack 
anywhere, and life means nothing to them.  He is pleased that 
the GOB and USG are working together on counter-terrorism and 
this cooperation will lead to real results. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
GOB Needs Additional Evidence Against Suspects 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (S) Regarding the six suspects, Al Mutawwa said that hard 
evidence against them would improve the case to keep them in 
custody.  The court might rule that there was not enough 
evidence against them currently to keep them in prison. 
However, as additional evidence came to light, the GOB could 
arrest them again.  The Ambassador stressed the need for a 
thorough investigation, and to keep the suspects in prison 
while a case against them was being developed.  The Minister 
said that he understood the Ambassador\'s message and promised 
to pass it to Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. 
He also pledged to urge the PM to meet soon with the 
Ambassador. 
 
6.  (C) The Minister asked about the current situation in 
Saudi Arabia.  The Ambassador responded that it remained 
worrisome.  It was a good example of what could happen if a 
government does not get on top of the security situation 
early enough.  He noted that bilateral cooperation was very 
good now.  Al Mutawwa stated that in the case of Iraq, 
Bahrain shared and believed in the U.S. aim of stability. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
U.S. Assistance on Democracy and Economy 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador said that Bahrain had taken many 
positive steps on democracy and economy.  Al Mutawwa thanked 
the Ambassador for U.S. assistance in these areas.  He said 
that Bahrain wanted to build a strong democratic base and was 
committed to dialogue with the opposition to achieve this. 
Regarding the FTA, the Minister said that the GOB was focused 
on the benefits the Bahraini people can derive from the 
agreement.  The Ambassador pledged to work with the Bahraini 
government and private sector to deepen trade and investment 
ties between the two countries.

SUBJECT: SEPARATIST MOVEMENT EMERGES WITHIN BAHRAIN\'S 
LARGEST OPPOSITION SOCIETY 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  Following a period of speculation, Nezar Al Baharna, 
a prominent Shia businessman and former board member of the 
largest Shia opposition political society Al Wifaq, confirmed 
to the press in late August that he planned to establish a 
new political society called the Society of Justice and 
Development.  Soon after, four other prominent Shia, 
businessman Jala Haji Hassan Al A\'ali, leading cleric Seyad 
Deya\'a Al Mousawi, Al Wifaq founding member Jawad Fairooz, 
and Chairman of the Central Governorates Municipal Council 
Nabeel Sayed, either publicly announced or indicated to 
PolOFF that they also intended to join the new society.  In 
response, members of Al Wifaq staged a sit-in at its 
headquarters on September 1 to protest Al Baharna\'s move. 
 
2.  (C)  Al Baharna\'s steps to establish the new society have 
fueled widespread complaints that he is intentionally trying 
to split Al Wifaq. But Al Baharna told PolOFF that his 
departure from Al Wifaq was due to lack of a consolidated 
platform and a clear vision for the future. Al Baharna said 
that Al Wifaq\'s current leadership insists on boycotting the 
2006 national elections, as it did in 2002.  He said his 
political society will participate in the democratic process 
and did not rule out his own candidacy in the 2006 
parliamentary elections. Al Baharna did not comment whether 
his society would have a strictly Shia membership base, and 
added that increasing the number of political societies was 
beneficial because it brings about competition, resulting in 
more effective, responsive political organizations. 
 
3.  (C)  Jawad Fairooz denied rumors that establishment of 
this new society was a GOB-backed plan to weaken the Shia. 
Fairooz told PolFSN on September 5 that he does not believe 
establishing a new party will split Al Wifaq and that the 
organization is strong enough to withstand the formation of a 
new society.  He pointed to the ongoing struggles between 
hard-liner Hassan Mushaima and more moderate President Shaikh 
Ali Salman as evidence of Al Wifaq\'s strength and ability to 
withstand differences within the organization.  Fairooz noted 
that Al Wifaq continues to attract the support of most 
Bahraini Shia. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Al Wifaq\'s continued boycott of elections 
and single-minded focus on returning to the (very short) 
\"heyday\" of democracy in the early 1970\'s has meant that 
Bahrain\'s Shia have had little voice in governing or public 
decision-making.  While Al-Wifaq has brought together 
Bahrain\'s Shia and forced the government to deal with it as a 
legitimate voice for the country\'s majority sect, the 
creation of Al Baharna\'s new society has the potential to 
become a significant move toward increased political 
participation in the country.  END COMMENT.

B. No specific region although all anti-government activities 
take place in Manama. 
C. Yes 
D. Yes.  Both the Sunni and Shi\'a sects have demonstrated 
anti-Americanism in the past.  Anti-Americanism is not 
endemic in Bahrain and is usually demonstrated in response to 
some USG foreign policy position or military action.  For

B. The cells have been known to have an operational, 
financial and support presence. 
C. GOB is not sympathetic to groups, but has not dealt 
forcefully in eliminating them. 
D. No 
E. Yes. Although Bahrain is well known as a moderate country, 
it is nonetheless an Islamic country.  Hizballah, Al-Qaida 
and other Islamic terrorist groups proclaiming resistance to 
the United States\' presence in the region have generated some 
sympathies.  This does not however, necessarily translate 
into a call to arms. 
F. The EAC is aware of this presence and is particularly 
concerned with the Iranians.  There has been IRGC 
surveillance of US military facilities in the past, but none 
reported recently.  The EAC is also aware and concerned about 
a Chinese trade office located 30 meters from the Embassy 
parking lot.  There is no information linking these hostile 
intelligence services to potential anti-American terrorist 
acts. 
G. Possession of weapons is illegal in Bahrain.  The EAC 
considers weapons and explosives to be unavailable in 
Bahrain.  The EAC is concerned about the flow of weapons into 
Bahrain from Saudi Arabia.

the upcoming signing of the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA) and the October 1 meeting of finance ministers on the 
G8 Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) initiative

also noted the significance of the groundwork laid after the 
signing of the 1999 TIFA Agreement and the importance of 
having kept both business sectors engaged in the process. 
 
2. (U) Saif reviewed his travel plans, starting in Washington 
for the September 14 signing ceremony followed by the first 
FTA \"road show\" which he will lead on September 22 in New 
York.  This will be the first of several events that Saif 
will host in the U.S. in the coming year to promote the FTA 
and the benefits of doing business in Bahrain.  The New York 
event will focus on the finance and banking sector but will 
also include a larger event targeting a variety of 
medium-sized enterprises.  The GOB expects to focus its next 
road show on Chicago. 
 
3. (U) The Ambassador responded that the Embassy was also 
gearing up for the implementation phase and was looking for 
opportunities to work with the GOB to promote the FTA and the 
increased business opportunities it offers.  Saif noted that 
he welcomed the return of MEPI-funded consultants performing 
a sectoral analysis of the Bahraini economy to help guide the 
FTA implementation.

IRAQ 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe for Reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C)  Al Jazeera Satellite Channel and Iraq dominated the 
conversation during the Ambassador\'s Sept. 6 introductory 
call on Minister of Information Nabeel bin Yaqoob Al Hamer. 
The Minister said that he had directed Bahrain Satellite 
Television to stop airing the videotapes on abductions and 
kidnappings in Iraq during news broadcasts because airing 
them serves no good purpose.  He mentioned that the GOB had 
also spoken to Al Jazeera Satellite Channel and Al Arabiyya 
about not airing the hostage videotapes. 
 
2.  (C)  When asked if Al Jazeera had ever had a 
correspondent based in Bahrain, Al Hamer replied no, adding 
that he continued to receive requests from Al Jazeera on 
this.   According to Al Hamar, even though Bahrain\'s 
relationship with Qatar had improved following the ICJ 
decision about the Hawar Islands, Al Jazeera continued to 
focus only on negative stories about Bahrain. 
 
3.  (C)  The Minister opined that Al Jazeera was losing 
credibility in the region and that most Bahraini viewers 
watched Al Arabiyya, which he believes is more balanced (Al 
Arabiyya does have a correspondent in Bahrain).  He added 
that Bahrain\'s majority Shia population was displeased with 
Al Jazeera\'s coverage of the recent events in Najaf, which

SUBJECT: BAHRAINI TENDER BOARD BRINGS TRANSPARENCY TO 
PROCESS 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
Evidence of Improved Transparency 
--------------------------------- 
 
1.  (U) The Ambassador paid an introductory call on Minister 
of State and Chairman of the Tenders Board Abdul Hussein Ali 
Mirza on September 6, discussed the upcoming Bahrain Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA), and reviewed the recently implemented 
tender process.  The Ambassador noted that the FTA would 
increase U.S. business interest in GOB tenders and that a 
transparent and user-friendly tender process was particularly 
important to American companies.  Mirza called the Board,s 
efforts to streamline the process and ensure transparency a 
significant success, and pointed to improved ratings from 
Standard and Poor,s and on the Financial Times transparency 
index as unbiased evidence corroborating his claim. Mirza 
commented that Bahraini business people are uncertain as to 
how they can benefit from the FTA.  He urged the Ambassador 
to take a leading role in helping to define those benefits. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Tender Board Established in Response to Corruption Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (U) Mirza said that managing the Tender Board takes up 
most of his time.  The Board was established in January 2003 
in response to public calls for greater transparency and 
credibility in government procurement.  The law establishing 
the Tender Board drew on best practices from regional 
governments as well as the United States and the UN.  All 
tenders over BD 10,000 are now managed by the Tender Board 
(in consultation with the concerned ministry), while those 
under BD 10,000 continue to be managed by ministries 
themselves.  Since its inception in 2003 the Tenders Board 
has processed and awarded approximately 1,300 tenders worth 
an estimated $1.3 billion. 
 
-------------- 
Implementation 
-------------- 
 
3. (U) According to Mirza, the Board,s procedures have been 
transparent from the outset.  All tenders are unsealed in an 
open meeting, bids are recorded and stamped to ensure they 
cannot be tampered with, and posted on the Board,s website. 
The Board uses a \"two envelope\" policy for tenders that 
require a technical component.  This involves opening the 
technical bid first to ensure that all bidders meet the 
specifications and, once confirmed, opening the financial bid 
to ensure the contract goes to the least expensive qualified 
bidder. 
 
4. (U) To ensure that the process is cost effective as well 
as fair and transparent, Mirza has begun to collect data to 
determine if amounts budgeted during the previous year by 
ministries implementing a project are the same as or less 
than actual costs.  He estimates the government has saved BD 
30 million since January 2003.  The Tender Board is now also 
tracking the time period between a Request for Proposal and 
tender award to measure the efficiency of the Board and the 
concerned ministries.

SUBJECT: CROWN PRINCE DISCUSSES PLANNED LABOR REFORM 
INITIATIVE 
 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) During the Ambassador\'s September 5 introductory call 
on Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa (septel), the CP 
said that his office was organizing a national debate on 
labor law reforms.  The initiative stems from Bahrain\'s 
desire to move away from an economy based upon a low cost 
labor model to a high skills, and later an information 
management-based economy, along the lines of Singapore. 
 
2.  (C) The CP said that the expected reforms would be huge 
and controversial.  Currently, a foreign worker received a 
work permit tied to a specific employer, and the worker has 
no legal status outside of his/her employment.  This has led 
to low wages and difficult working conditions.  Additionally, 
employers would rather hire a foreigner than a Bahraini, who 
would demand better pay and conditions. 
 
3.  (C) The CP said that the reforms would remove the link 
between the foreign worker and a single employer and he/she 
would have the right to seek any employment in the country as 
long as either the worker or his/her employer pays a monthly 
fee of $250 to keep the work permit valid.  Thus the 
differential between the cost of a foreign worker and a 
Bahraini worker would decrease and employers would have an 
incentive to invest in the skills of their employees through 
training to boost retention.  The CP argued that the market 
would control the demand for foreign labor rather than a 
regulation from the government in the form of a mandatory 
\"Bahrainization\" campaign.  He noted that the new rules would 
apply to household help - maids, nannies, housekeepers - as 
well as other types of workers. 
 
4.  (C) The Crown Prince explained that the national debate 
would be launched on September 23 and would continue through 
Ramadan, which ends in mid-November.  At the end of November, 
there will be a concluding conference with the participation 
of politicians, political societies, ministers, labor 
representatives, and international experts.  The conference 
will produce a draft labor law that will be reviewed by the 
Cabinet and forwarded to the parliament.  He noted that his 
office will guide this process from behind the scenes, but 
the Economic Development Board will be the public face.  He 
hoped that future Bahraini success in the labor field could 
serve as a model for other regional countries, such as Saudi 
Arabia, which also host large communities of foreign workers.

October 1 meeting of finance ministers on the G8 Broader 
Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) initiative (Ref A), the 
IFC\'s Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East and 
North Africa (IFC Facility) (Ref B) and the upcoming signing

Saif confirmed that he would attend the October 1 meeting 
chaired by Treasury Secretary Snow and passed a copy of his 
letter to Secretary Snow confirming his attendance.  (We will 
fax it to NEA/ARPI.)  Regarding the proposed agenda, Saif 
said Arab ministers were now considering the draft and would 
provide a joint response. 
 
2. (U) Saif also confirmed Bahrain remains interested in 
hosting the entrepreneurship center in Bahrain.  A diplomatic 
note sent to the Embassy dated September 8 affirms Bahrain\'s 
desire to host \"an Institute for Entrepreneurship Training 
and Development along the lines of the preliminary proposal 
(Bahrain) prepared in May 2004 for the Sea Island

\"adequate funding for the initiative.\"  The letter further 
clarifies that Bahrain would provide the space for the 
facility but that it would be \"a separate Institute, not part 
of the existing Institute of Banking and Finance, but 
parallel to it and building on\" BFIF\'s experience. 
 
3. (U) In a follow-on conversation, Saif\'s financial advisor 
Vivian Brown told EconOff that Bahrain wanted to limit its 
participation to providing space for the Institute, and that 
Bahrain was unlikely to be able to contribute funds to 
support its activities, particularly in the payment of 
instructors.  He added that he expected the Minister would be 
prepared to discuss this further at the October 1 meeting. 
 
4. (U) On the subject of the IFC facility, Saif said Bahrain 
would limit its participation to a contribution \"in kind\". 
He reviewed his recent conversation with Treasury U/S Taylor 
on this subject, noting he believed there was no lack of 
resources in the region and discussed with Taylor how to 
\"network those funds.\"  Saif is now waiting for a concept 
paper from U/S Taylor on this issue.

1.  (C)  On September 7, US Ambassador to the United Nations 
Economic and Social Council and Coordinator of the US 
delegation to the UN General Assembly Sichan Siv met with GOB 
officials and parliamentarians to discuss the United States\' 
five UN General Assembly priorities (Reftel). 
 
-------------------------------- 
Reducing Middle East Resolutions 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador Siv stated that there is a need to reduce 
the number of one-sided Middle East resolutions, and cited 
four resolutions that deal with Israel.  Minister of State 
for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar responded that 
Bahrain will not support this initiative. The Minister views 
the Palestinian issue as a core problem for the region and 
believes that the focus of the UNGA on Palestinian issues is 
appropriate.  He objected to getting rid of resolutions just 
because they are considered one-sided and in favor of 
Palestine.  Several Shura Council members echoed Abdul 
Ghaffar\'s point of view.  But in a separate meeting, MFA A/US 
for Political Affairs and International Cooperation Ahmed Al 
Haddad offered to discuss this initiative further when 
Bahrain\'s delegation arrives in New York later this month for 
UNGA.  Ambassador Siv offered to put Al Haddad in contact 
with Ambassador Kennedy at USUN. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Advancing Economic Freedom - Beyond the Monterrey Consensus 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador Siv praised Bahrain for its economic 
performance and explained that the focus of the US initiative 
is advancing economic freedom by increased mobilization of 
domestic resources in the private sector.  MFA Director of 
the International Directorate Ghassan Shaiko said that the 
GOB was in support of discussing the US initiative but 
expressed concern that it did not address the role of donor 
countries.  Al Haddad said that the economic growth of 
developing countries should be viewed as a partnership 
between nations.  Ambassador Siv offered to arrange for more 
discussions for Al Haddad in New York. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Combating Trafficking-in-Persons 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Both Abdul Ghaffar and MFA A/US for Coordination and 
Follow-up Shaikh Abdul Aziz stated that the GOB supports any 
initiative that helps combat trafficking-in-persons, 
especially child sex tourism.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz informed Siv 
that Bahrain does not have a teenage sex tourism problem, but 
does encounter foreign worker abuse.  He stated that the GOB 
has undertaken several measures to combat 
trafficking-in-persons but admits that there are areas that 
still need improvement.  As chairman of the GOB\'s 
inter-ministerial committee, he plans to establish a victim 
assistance shelter and suggest ways to speed up the judicial 
process.  He added that Bahrain has a MEPI-funded American 
Bar Association judicial reform project that is tackling case 
management and alternative dispute resolution to speed up 
court decisions.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz also mentioned that the 
GOB is drafting a new labor law and he is pursuing 
legislation that specifically criminalizes trafficking. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Promoting Democracy - The Democracy Caucus 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Abdul Ghaffar said that the GOB supports measures 
that increase cooperation among democratic countries.  In 
2002, he attended the second ministerial conference of the 
Community of Democracies in Seoul, which produced the 
Democracy Caucus.  The Minister expressed interest in 
attending the 2005 ministerial conference in Santiago.

6.  (C)  Abdul Ghaffar said that the GOB has not made a final 
decision with regard to the Costa Rica resolution. In a 
subsequent meeting, former UN ECOSOC Vice President and MFA 
official Jassim Mohammed Buallay explained that the GOB will 
conduct internal discussions on this issue, focusing on the 
ministries of Islamic Affairs and Health.  He added that 
cloning is an especially sensitive issue because of the 
religious and medical dimensions.

with the four main opposition societies (Al Wefaq National 
Islamic Society, National Democratic Action Society, Al Amal 
Al Islami and Al Tajamu Al Watani) in an attempt to resolve 
constitutional issues concerning the process of introducing 
and passing legislation.  Al Alawi remarked that members of 
the opposition societies need to run for parliamentary office 
if they want to make changes to the constitution.  He said he 
is being careful not to set a precedent by offering to amend 
the constitution outside of the parliamentary process.  He 
complained that the opposition societies continually solicit 
the King\'s involvement to change the constitution so that the 
elected lower house of parliament (Nuwab Council) can secure 
more legislative power than the appointed upper house (Shura 
Council).  Al Alawi told the Ambassador that the King had 
decided not to get directly involved in this dialogue.  He 
stated that this dialogue will not produce any changes to the 
constitution through channels outside of the legislative 
branch.

has been very pleased with NDI Program Manager Fawzi Guleid 
but cautioned that the GOB considers his work with the

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Minister of Oil Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa told the 
Ambassador September 6 that U.S. companies have participated 
successfully in the development of Bahrain\'s petroleum and 
petrochemicals sector, and he looks forward to continued 
cooperation with the U.S.  He stated that his primary concern 
is finding a steady supply of natural gas, and noted that 
Qatar is the natural source.  As discussions with Qatar have 
become stuck because of Saudi Arabia\'s lack of clarity on 
whether a pipeline can pass through Saudi territory, a 
Bahraini official visited Iran to discuss the supply of gas. 
The Ambassador responded that the United States would be 
greatly concerned about a deal with Iran and recommended that 
Bahrain focus on the Qatar option.  The Minister said that 
Saudi Arabia intends to expand oil production in the Abu 
Saafa oil field from 140 thousand to 300 thousand barrels per 
day, and he hopes the Saudis continue to donate their share 
of the field\'s production to Bahrain.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
U.S. Firms Welcome in Bahrain 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Minister of Oil Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa welcomed the 
Ambassador to Bahrain during their September 6 introductory 
meeting and explained that Bahrain has a long track record of 
successful cooperation with American companies in the 
petroleum sector.  He noted that the Ministry had recently 
invited four American firms - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow 
Chemicals, Huntsman, and ABB Lummus - out of nine companies 
total to submit proposals for the development of a new $1.4 
billion naptha cracker.  The timetable for the project is 
still not clear, but it likely will proceed because the GOB 
has calculated that the internal rate of return on the 
investment would be 16 percent and the plant would employ 
many Bahrainis. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Searching for Steady Supply of Gas 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) He stated that his main concern is access to a steady 
supply of natural gas.  The Ambassador noted that he had met 
with Exxon concerning the proposed pipeline project from 
Qatar.  Al Khalifa said that the Emir of Qatar had told him 
that Qatar wants to proceed with the project but Saudi Arabia 
had caused it to get bogged down.  The Qatar plan was to 
build a pipeline from Qatar to Bahrain, and onward to Kuwait 
through Saudi territory.  However, the Saudi government has 
not yet signaled whether this would be acceptable. 
 
4.  (C) The Minister said that Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad 
Al Khalifa had taken possession of the gas issue and had 
formed a committee to explore Bahrain\'s options.  An Under 
Secretary from the Ministry of Finance and National Economy 
 
SIPDIS 
visited Iran to discuss the supply of gas.  The Ambassador 
interjected that the United States would be greatly concerned 
with a Bahraini gas deal with Iran, and strongly recommended 
that Bahrain conclude a deal with Qatar.  The Minister said 
that Bahrain\'s intent was to show the Qataris that it had 
other options, and noted that perhaps Saudi Arabia or Iraq 
could supply gas to Bahrain.  He commented, however, that 
Qatar was the most logical solution. 
 
5.  (C) The Minister stated that Bahrain has domestic 
supplies of natural gas to satisfy current consumption but 
needs access to additional supply to meet future demand.  He 
said that the national economy and industries must grow and 
the lack of gas is already acting as a constraint on 
expansion.  Bahrain could take advantage of high 
international prices for urea and methanol if it had 
sufficient supplies of gas to expand its petrochemical 
industry.  He noted that ALBA, Bahrain\'s aluminum 
manufacturer, had signed an agreement with U.S.-firm ALCOA in 
2003 to produce aluminum jointly on a sixth production line, 
but that deal was in jeopardy because Bahrain did not have 
enough gas to support the sixth line.  He indicated that 
Bahrain had drilled for gas in Bahraini territorial waters 
near the border with Qatar but had come up empty.  Chevron 
and Petronas are scheduled to drill additional test holes in 
the vicinity of Hawar Island. 
 
------------------------- 
Saudi Generosity with Oil 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Regarding oil, Al Khalifa said that though Saudi 
Arabia and Bahrain officially share the 140,000 barrels per 
day produced in the Abu Saafa field, Saudi Arabia donates its 
half to Bahrain.  The Saudis had announced previously their 
intent to invest in the field to expand production to 300,000 
barrels per day, and the Minister hoped that Saudi Arabia 
would continue to donate its share to Bahrain, saying the 
Saudis have been very generous.  He indicated that Bahrain 
both benefits and loses from high international oil prices. 
While Bahrain exports oil products, it purchases crude to 
process in its refinery.  The net impact of high 
international oil prices on Bahrain\'s economy is positive, 
but there are costs as well.

1.  (C)  G/TIP Senior Reports Officer Feleke Assefa visited 
Bahrain August 20-24 to meet with GOB officials and demarche 
them on G/TIP\'s Bahrain-specific Action Plan (Ref A). In 
response to the demarche, GOB officials outlined what 
measures they have implemented to combat trafficking and 
their plans for the upcoming year, which focus on 
establishing a victim assistance shelter, speeding up the 
judicial process, and a national awareness campaign. Assefa 
also met with the NGO Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) 
President Nabeel Rajab who reported on the status of migrant 
workers in Bahrain and described the rescue activities of his 
volunteer group.  Assefa also met a group of abused runaway 
housemaids who recounted their situations in a meeting 
organized by BCHR. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) In all his meetings with GOB officials, Assefa urged 
the GOB to investigate and prosecute recruitment agencies 
found guilty of sexually abusing housemaids and establish a 
NGO-operated GOB protected victim assistance shelter. Assefa 
concluded that the GOB appears genuinely engaged in 
anti-trafficking measures but lacks the expertise for proper 
implementation.  Training is essential. Assefa informed GOB 
officials that the USG has funded the International Office of 
Migration (IOM) to train GOB personnel in anti-TIP measures. 
Assefa suggested that IOM assist with the establishment of a 
victim assistance shelter and possibly assist the GOB with a 
nation-wide public awareness campaign. The GOB looks forward 
to IOM\'s arrival in September. (NOTE: IOM Project Manager 
will arrive the week of September 18th. END NOTE) 
 
---------------------------------- 
Prevention - Pamphlet Distribution 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Assefa noticed upon his arrival at the airport that 
no literature for foreign workers was displayed or 
distributed.  Bahrain Centre for Human Rights/Migrant Workers 
Group (BCHR/MWG) volunteer Selma Bala lamented that the 
biggest problem for many of the housemaids trying to escape 
is that they do not know who to call or where to run.  On 
August 23 we suggested to Director of Security Affairs Khalid 
Al Moawda that immigration officers distribute pamphlets 
translated into Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Singhalese, 
Bengali, and Hindi when processing housemaid visas.  Al 
Moawda said he was willing to arrange for distribution of the 
pamphlets produced by the TIP inter-ministerial committee. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Prevention - Public Awareness Campaigns 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  On August 21 BCHR President Nabeel Rajab commented 
that his organization continues to apply pressure to the GOB 
by alerting the press about every housemaid abuse case it 
hears of.  He attributed the GOB\'s swift work in prosecuting 
Anita Verma\'s case due to abundant press coverage in the 
English language newspapers (Ref B).  BCHR Public Relations 
Coordinator Janan Shaikh Abdulla noted that BCHR experiences 
difficulty in getting its press releases on trafficking cases 
published in the Arabic press.  We noted that chairman of the 
GOB\'s TIP inter-ministerial committee Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin 
Mubarak Al Khalifa had previously requested technical 
assistance for implementing public awareness campaigns on 
TIP. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Protection - Victim Assistance Shelter 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Rajab expressed his frustration with the GOB\'s lack 
of progress in establishing a victim assistance shelter. 
With the approval of Shaikh Abdul Aziz, BCHR raised BD30,000 
(USD80,000) to establish a shelter.  However, last month the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA), the ministry 
responsible for registering NGOs, sent a letter to Rajab 
informing him that it is not part of BCHR\'s purview to 
establish a shelter and that BCHR must stop working on this 
project.  Rajab hopes to bring this up with Shaikh Abdul Aziz 
soon.  MFA Director of Bilateral Relations Dr. Dhafer Al 
Umran explained that both MOLSA and the Ministry of Interior 
(MOI) had delayed establishing a GOB victim assistance 
shelter because no one had the expertise to \"do it right.\" 
Al Umran admitted that the ministries had been quibbling on a 
number of issues related to the shelter.  The committee was 
embroiled with who should manage the shelter and provide 
counseling, medical assistance and legal aid.  Assefa stated 
that IOM will be able to help establish a shelter that meets 
international standards.  Al Umran said he looked forward to 
meeting the IOM project manager upon his arrival to help 
resolve the situation. (NOTE: PolOff scheduled a meeting with 
MFA and the IOM Project Manager on September 21. END NOTE) 
 
6.  (U)  Rajab noted that the Philippine mission has a good 
reputation for providing refuge to runaway and abused 
Philippine housemaids.  The mission runs a shelter on embassy 
grounds. However, it does not grant access to BCHR volunteers 
or police to pursue the investigation and prosecution of 
legal cases.  Therefore a shelter of international standards 
is preferable.  Assefa said that IOM will be able to assist 
in establishing the screening center that would benefit all 
victims. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Protection - Standardized Housemaid Contract 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Rajab also mentioned that BCHR submitted to Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
(UNIFEM) model contract that was previously endorsed by the 
Jordanian government for non-Jordanian domestic workers. 
Rajab hoped that the inter-ministerial committee would accept 
the UNIFEM contract as a standardized contract for foreign 
housemaids in Bahrain.  Rajab complained that it has been 
over 10 months with no feedback from the committee.  In 
response to Assefa\'s question, Al Umran said that he would 
check with the committee about the status of adopting the 
model contract. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Protection - Legal Status to Laborers 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Assistant Undersecretary 
for Courts and Notary Affairs Judge Abdulla bin Hassan Al 
Boainain mentioned that he used to hear cases about abused 
housemaids and knows the legal problems encountered by 
laborers who press charges against their employers.  On 
August 22 Al Boainain drafted a Letter of Cooperation between 
MOI, Passport Directorate and MOJ to draft a law that will 
give workers legal status during the time his/her labor case 
is being decided.  Al Boainain explained that current labor 
law makes no provision for a laborer who has left his 
employer due to a labor dispute to remain in Bahrain to work. 
Al Boainain admitted that the National Assembly is very slow 
in approving legislation and was skeptical that the amendment 
could be implemented quickly. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Prosecution - Abused Worker Cases 
--------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  As noted in last year\'s TIP report, the processing 
and prosecution of labor cases moves slowly.  Rajab remarked 
that ever since the new Minister of Interior Lt. General 
Shaikh Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa took office, he has 
noticed greater care and an increased awareness for abused 
housemaid cases.  Criminal Investigation Directorate 
Brigadier Farooq Salman Jassim Al-Maawda and member of the 
GOB TIP inter-ministerial committee Colonel Adil Khalifa 
Hamad Al Fadhel echoed Rajab\'s remarks.  In their 
directorate, combating TIP has become a top priority.  Rajab 
recalled in July that the police and the courts moved quickly 
to apprehend two recruitment agency bosses who allegedly 
raped two Indonesian and Bangladeshi housemaids. 
 
10.  (C)  BCHR/MWG volunteer Selma Bala added that maids are 
too scared to press charges and do not like dealing with the 
authorities.  MOJ Al Boainain explained that the GOB appoints 
legal counsel when someone is unable to afford it, although 
Bahrain lacked a formal Legal Aid program.  Assefa mentioned 
that some victims feel more comfortable with a NGO attorney 
and not a GOB attorney. With a University of Bahrain law 
school that is 78% female, Assefa suggested that Al Boainain 
consider incorporating women graduate students to advise in 
labor cases. 
 
---------------------------- 
Corrupt Recruitment Agencies 
---------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  On August 21, Assefa and PolOff met with four 
abused and runaway housemaids and volunteers from BCHR\'s 
Migrant Workers Group. A Sri Lankan housemaid recounted how 
she was tied to a table and raped for several hours by her 
employer.  The employer then dumped her on the recruitment 
agency\'s doorstep.  The recruiter kicked her out of the 
office to fend for herself.  A citizen realized she was 
injured and called BCHR for assistance. 
 
12.  (C)  Two Indonesian housemaids told Assefa and PolOff 
that they had run away from their employers just the night 
before.  They claimed that they were forced to clean four 
households, not just the one household for which they were 
each contracted. In addition, the employer has not paid their 
salaries in over three months.  One alleged that she was 
beaten.  Both housemaids said they were too scared to contact 
their recruiting agent because he would beat them and lock 
them up until he could find another employer. They would not 
tell BCHR volunteers the name of the agent.  For the time 
being, they are living with BCHR volunteers who will take 
them to the police to file a report against the sponsor. 
 
13.  (C)  Bala recounted the story of an Indian housemaid who 
was raped by her sponsor, locked up and beaten by her 
employment agency and then put on a plane before she could 
complain to the police. She offered to provide PolOff with a 
list of abusive agencies to submit to the GOB to take action. 
 On August 23 Director of Security Affairs Khalid Al Moawda 
told Assefa that he would like a copy of the list so he could 
send someone to inspect these agencies.  Al Moawda noted that 
the GOB shut down 63 recruitment agencies in 2003.  He added 
that he is working with MOJ Al Boainain to amend the penal 
code to assess punishment for these types of crimes.  The 
current law only allows the MOLSA and MOI to shut down or 
blacklist recruitment agencies. 
 
------------------- 
A Successful Rescue 
------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  In 2003 Indian housemaid Anita Verma was seriously 
beaten by her employer (Ref B). Eight months later, healthy 
and content, Anita recounted how on that night a neighbor who 
heard her screams called BCHR.  BCHR got her medical care, 
brought her to the police and after recuperation found her a 
new sponsor.  Anita has been able to stay in Bahrain and 
press charges against her employer.  The GOB has not 
prevented Verma from working while pursuing her case.  The 
court process has been slow but in October the Criminal 
Courts will rule on her case. Verma plans to stay and work in 
Bahrain and send money home to her children.

1. Embassy Manama appreciates this opportunity to comment on 
the Department\'s efforts to better support non-FCS posts.  We 
believe that non-FCS posts would benefit both from increased 
access to Commerce information and accounting systems and 
additional training opportunities. 
 
2.  Embassy Manama offers the following suggestions: 
 
-- Full access to Commerce\'s e-menu finance system.  Without 
full access Embassy Manama has encountered difficulty when 
charging fees for services provided to U.S. businesses. 
Currently Manama is authorized to charge for services 
according to standard USDOC practice.  Unfortunately, fiscal 
data still must be entered by FCS Dhahran -- adding to 
Dhahran\'s workload -- while not reducing Manama\'s.  While FCS 
posts are, and should remain, a ready resource for non-FCS 
posts, the lack of access to those systems has hindered 
Manama\'s ability to provide services efficiently.  In 
addition, post has encountered difficulties when receiving 
funds obligated in e-menu rather than by cable. 
 
-- Additional training for officers assigned to non-FCS 
posts.  Of particular interest, the \"nuts and bolts\" of 
required reporting including how to use the Commerce system 
to track services provided. 
 
-- Increase collaboration among regional non-FCS posts.  In 
particular, developing joint projects, working together to 
represent U.S. business at regional industry conferences, 
establishing regional \"best practices.\"

SUBJECT: COMMERCE MINISTER CALLS FTA A TURNING POINT 
 
 
------------------------- 
FTA Will Expand Relations 
------------------------- 
 
1.  The Ambassador met with Minister of Commerce Ali Bin 
Saleh Al Saleh on September 15 to discuss the U.S.-Bahrain 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the potential for increased 
cooperation between U.S. and Bahraini businesses.  Al Saleh 
noted that this year had been a \"turning point\" in the 
U.S.-Bahrain bilateral relationship, particularly in economic 
and commercial relations.  The Ambassador pointed to the 
rapid negotiation of an FTA as evidence of that good 
relationship as well as the non-controversial nature of 
concluding the agreement with Bahrain. 
 
---------------------------- 
Bahrain: Gateway to the Gulf 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  The Ambassador called the FTA a model for others in the 
Gulf and an important launching point for U.S. efforts to 
promote open markets in the region.  Al Saleh said the FTA 
fit in well with Bahrain,s own policy of promoting regional 
free trade and becoming the \"Gateway to the Gulf.\" He added 
that the GOB is also very aware that ensuring public security 
and stability are key to realizing its economic development 
goals. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Bahraini Expectations High for FTA 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  Al Saleh pointed out the high expectations of the public 
as FTA implementation draws near.  He acknowledged the need 
to redouble GOB efforts to explain to Bahraini business how 
they might benefit from the FTA and asked for close 
cooperation with the U.S.  The Ambassador called FTA 
implementation a major focus of the USG and promised that the 
U.S. Embassy would work closely with the GOB and 
organizations like the newly founded American Chamber of 
Commerce to highlight the FTA.  He added that the FTA is a 
unique opportunity to spotlight doing business with Bahrain, 
but the window of opportunity to make an impact is finite. 
Without real opportunities for U.S. business in Bahrain, the 
impact of the FTA will remain symbolic.  The USG is now 
focusing its efforts on ensuring the FTA passes Congress 
before the election.  He suggested that the GOB work closely 
with parliament to ensure ratification.

--------------------------------------------- --- 
Projects Increase as Corruption Concerns Decline 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
1.  Ambassador met with Minister of Housing and Public Works 
Fahmi Bin Ali Al Jowder on September 8 to discuss new and 
ongoing projects, the Ministry,s experience with U.S. 
business partners and potential opportunities for U.S. 
business as a result of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). 
While officially now one Ministry -- Housing and Public Works 
-- the Minister manages two bureaucracies in two buildings. 
They are responsible for managing projects that account for 
some sixty to seventy percent of the GOB,s project budget. 
 
 
2.  Al Jowder said that the last three years had been 
extremely busy, reflecting both a revitalized economy after a 
1991-1999 recession and the GOB,s desire to invest in 
infrastructure.  His portfolio had also expanded in the last 
year when he took on the Housing Ministry, widely known for 
corruption.  Al Jowder admitted that he had been tasked with 
cleaning up the Ministry and that he had already pursued the 
prosecution of several staff members who had misappropriated 
land.  He also mentioned that the GOB was working on the 
creation of a Bahraini version of the U.S. General Accounting 
Office in order to improve transparency. 
 
------------------------------- 
Opportunities for U.S. Business 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  The Ambassador asked about the Ministry,s experience in 
working with U.S. business.  Al Jowder praised the work Great 
Lakes Dredging was doing in the new port, pointing out they 
completed their work four months early.  He indicated the 
Ministry would like to see the company do more in Bahrain. 
On the FTA, the Ambassador said that the next year would be 
an opportunity to put Bahrain \"on the map\" and that he 
expects to receive more requests from American construction 
firms for advocacy services.  The Ambassador also referred to 
the new tender law (reftel), indicating that U.S. firms would 
benefit from a more transparent process. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
King Wants Army Corps of Engineers in Bahrain 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  Al Jowder also mentioned the King,s interest in seeing 
the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) come to Bahrain to provide 
advisory services on a variety of projects including highway 
planning.  The King had been impressed by previous work by 
ACE at the Royal Court.  However plans were dropped when the 
payment mechanism requested by ACE clashed with Bahrain,s 
tender process.  The Ambassador indicated the Embassy would 
follow up to see what could be done.  (Note:  Embassy 
Manama,s Office of Military Cooperation (OMC) confirms that 
the proposed technical assistance to have been provided by 
ACE can only be funded as a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) 
case.  The Minister had some concerns with the funding 
mechanism, which OMC believed had been resolved through a 
series of meetings between the Minister and Embassy officials 
in June 2003.  However, the Embassy never received final 
approval from the Ministry and the FMS case (valued at USD 4 
million) expired in August 2003.  Embassy will again review 
the case with the Minister in an effort to find the necessary 
common ground to provide ACE assistance.  End Note)

SIPDIS 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/22/2014 
TAGS: PREL, MARR, PGOV, BA 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR COMBATANT COMMANDER CENTRAL 
COMMAND TRIP TO BAHRAIN 26 SEPTEMBER 2004 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D). 
 
1.  (S) General Abizaid, we look forward to seeing you in 
Bahrain.  We have asked for calls on the King, Crown Prince, 
and the Defense Minister apart from your attendance at the 
Disaster Preparedness Conference.  Since your last visit 
here, the travel warning has been lifted and the DOD Bahrain 
School reopened, and the detention of the four key terrorist 
suspects has been extended into October.  On September 14, 
the United States and Bahrain signed a free trade agreement, 
only the third agreement we have with an Arab country and the 
first in the Gulf.  Bahrainis, both the government and 
private citizens, have been delighted by these events, but 
still apprehensive about the summer events and what they 
might portend.  The King views the NAVCENT presence as 
indispensable and our relationship has remained strong 
despite the departure of the Navy dependents. 
 
2.  (S) Looking to the period ahead, we continue to apply 
pressure to the GOB to make sure that the four terrorism 
suspects remain in jail.  There continues to be uncertainty 
about the future of the Bahrain School and what that means 
for U.S.-Bahraini relations.  Bahrainis worry about the 
future of the Navy presence and the continued departure 
status of Navy dependents.  They have questions about how the 
Naval Support Activity in Bahrain will fit into the overall 
U.S. military presence in the region.  They are aware of the 
global defense posture review, and that the Navy is 
evaluating issues such as the school, the status of 
dependents, and the U.S. military\'s future footprint in 
Bahrain and the region.  Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar expressed to the Ambassador 
September 22 his concern that any evaluation of the Navy\'s 
future in Bahrain should reiterate a commitment to Bahrain, 
and not represent a diminution of the U.S. presence.  The 
events of the summer generated uncertainty among the Bahraini 
government and Bahraini citizens about the strength and 
permanence of our commitment. 
 
3.  (S) Iraq.  The GOB is hopeful we will succeed in 
stabilizing Iraq and restarting its economy.  The Government 
understands the need to establish security in Iraq and fears 
the potential regional impact of any deterioration in the 
situation.  They fear above all massive instability in Iraq 
leading to a hasty American withdrawal and an Iranian-style 
Shia revolutionary government that might influence Bahrain\'s 
own Shia majority.  The government views the U.S. presence in 
Iraq as absolutely essential to their security.  Crown Prince 
Salman stated in a recent meeting with a visiting Codel that 
the U.S. must remain steadfast in supporting its troops on 
the ground so they can get the job done.  During your 
meetings, officials will be interested to hear your views. 
 
4.(S) Bahrain\'s Shia majority is satisfied that Saddam is 
gone.  Many Bahrainis outside of government are suspicious of 
American intentions in Iraq, but so far the Government has 
not taken any actions to indicate it feels particularly 
constrained in being publicly supportive of us.  Bahraini 
Shia feel an affinity for their fellow sect members in Iraq 
and are pained by U.S. military actions in Shia areas such as 
Najaf.  They publicly pledge their allegiance to Ayatollah 
Sistani.  At the same time, several Shia leaders have 
publicly condemned all violence in Iraq, whether by coalition 
forces or Iraqi elements.  Specifically, most Bahraini Shia 
do not support Muqtada Al Sadr, and many attribute his rise 
to prominence on his father\'s reputation and sacrifice. 
 
5.  (C) The GOB and the Iraqi Embassy signed a memorandum of 
understanding September 14 to train 4,000 Iraqis in civil 
defense.  The Bahrainis also have offered technical 
assistance to help rebuild Iraq\'s banking sector.  The 
Government does not perceive itself as wealthy enough to 
offer financial assistance. 
 
6.  (S) Bilateral Security Ties:  The GOB has accepted the 
departure of the Navy dependents and our desire for a smaller 
footprint, but remain hopeful they will return.  The decision 
to keep the DoDDs school open was very well received. 
However, we need to make a decision as soon as possible 
concerning the future status of the school\'s administration. 
The continued operation of military operations from the base 
and the presence of NAVCENT headquarters, including the DODEA 
Bahrain School, are ultimate indicators for the GOB of our 
military commitment here.  Should the basing of the Navy here 
ever come into doubt, it will have a significant impact on 
our relationship.  We have a Military Consultative Council 
meeting scheduled for Feb 2005.  This will provide a good 
forum to review our mil-to-mil programs and set a future 
course. 
 
7. (S) Coalition Force Contribution:  The King offered some 
naval support to provide security in the Northern Arabian 
Gulf to Iraq.  However, the GOB still awaits a formal request 
from the IIG before they will deploy their ship(s).  The USN 
has provided an ops/intel brief to the BDF to prepare them 
for the mission and the BDF now has an LNO at NAVCENT HQ. 
The GOB decided not to participate with airpower because they 
did not see a need, and did not offer ground forces in Iraq 
because they have no deployment or sustainment capabilities. 
Further, the GOB have indicated they will need a GCC decision 
supporting ground troops in Iraq before they even consider 
this option. 
 
8. (S) Foreign Military Financing:  Bahrain received USD 
24.85 million FMF grant from the FY04 DoS budget. This now 
brings their FMF total over the past two years to USD 145 
million.  They have used these funds to purchase a TPS 59 
radar (due to arrive late 2006), an infrared countermeasures 
suite for the head of state\'s new 747-400 (due in 12 months), 
the refurbishment of 14 Cobra helicopters and multiple spare 
cases for all services.  Due to the BDF,s equipment age 
increasing and the growing maintenance costs, the BDF sees 
FMF as an important means to bridge their budget deficits to 
sustain their readiness. 
 
9.  (S) Security: The King and Prime Minister are adamantly 
determined to maintain security for Americans here.  Whenever 
we make requests for extra security at an event, the police 
respond immediately and appropriately.  As you know, of the 
six Bahraini extremists who were re-arrested in mid-July, 
four continue to be held in custody and two of the less 
threatening subjects were released on September 11.    The 
four men still in custody will have another court hearing on 
October 16 regarding the case against them.  The GOB has kept 
us informed on the continuing status of this case.  They have 
committed to working with the USG to establish a 
Counter-Terrorism Operations Center (CTOC) and a 
Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Center (CTIC) along with 
openly accepting specialized training for CTOC operators.  In 
addition the Parliament is expected to consider a 
counter-terrorism law for passage when it reconvenes in 
mid-October.  The law will apply stiff penalties for 
conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. 
 
10. (S) Democratic Development:  Bahrain is a monarchy that 
in 2002 adopted a constitution reinstating a legislative body 
with one elected chamber, the first since the early 1970,s. 
The majority Shia mostly adhered to the call by the Al Wifaq 
Shia political society to boycott the 2002 parliamentary 
elections.  As a result, those Shia present in the elected 
lower house of parliament, the Council of Deputies, do not 
necessarily represent the views of their constituents. 
 
11. (S) During the 2003-04 parliamentary session, the process 
of presenting and passing legislation ground to a halt.  The 
constitution is unclear about whether the government or the 
parliament should take the lead role in proposing 
legislation, and differing interpretations led to a 
constitutional crisis.  In response to protests and a 
petition drive, the government decided to launch a 
constitutional dialogue led by the Minister of Labor and 
Social Affairs with leaders from four opposition political 
societies.  In early September, the oppositionists submitted 
proposed constitutional amendments for the government\'s 
consideration.  The Minister of Labor announced he would 
present the government\'s response in early October.  The 
Government is also encouraging the societies that previously 
boycotted elections to participate in the 2006 parliamentary 
elections. 
 
12. (S) Economy:  The United States and Bahrain signed a free 
trade agreement (FTA) on September 14, marking a new level of 
commitment in our bilateral economic relationship.  Bahrain 
is the first country in the Gulf region to have an FTA with 
us, and joins Jordan and Morocco as the only Arab states with 
FTAs.  We hope to use the Bahrain FTA as a springboard to 
promote economic reform, openness, and transparency in the 
region, and as an important step in realizing the President\'s 
vision of a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013.  Bahrain 
will cite the FTA as the United States, endorsement of its 
economy and to market Bahrain as a regional center for 
finance, insurance, banking, business services, education, 
and health care. 
 
13. (S) Middle East Peace:  The Bahraini government is deeply 
troubled by the continuing violence in Israel and the 
Palestinian territories.  Though far from the conflict, 
Bahrainis identify with the Palestinians.  The Crown Prince 
has told us that he would like to work with the Israeli 
government, in particular in fending off threats from Iran, 
but he cannot do so in the absence of some sort of settlement 
between Israel and the Palestinians.  The Crown Prince 
appreciates that the President has gone far to promote the 
establishment of an independent, viable Palestinian state, 
but he has asked that the Administration make a gesture to 
relieve the suffering of the Palestinian people.  Flare-ups 
in violence in the territories transfer directly into 
heightened emotions among average Bahrainis.

Bahraini Support for Military Transit Invaluable 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
1. (SBU) The Ambassador met with Minister of Transportation 
Sheikh Ali Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa on September 8 to discuss 
efforts to expand and manage Bahrain,s transportation 
infrastructure.  Al Khalifa,s portfolio also includes civil 
aviation as well as telecommunications, postal services and 
public transportation.  The Ambassador opened the meeting by 
thanking the Minister for the support Bahrain provides to 
transiting U.S. military planes and ships, which the Embassy 
estimates average 450-600 requests for flights (both transit 
of airspace and permission to land) and 50 ship passages per 
month.  The Minister replied that military air traffic 
represented 20 percent of Manama airport,s workload.  He 
added that the relationship works well and that Bahrain sees 
this as an important part of the good relationship the GOB 
has enjoyed with the U.S. military for over sixty years. 
 
------------------ 
Upgrading Gulf Air 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) The Minister characterized airport facilities in 
Manama as first-rate. Bahrain had seen an increase in cargo 
going though the airport but not by American companies.  He 
specifically raised the limited presence of both Federal 
Express and UPS in Bahrain and urged the Ambassador to work 
with American companies to ensure that DHL did not totally 
corner the market. 
 
3.  (C) The Minister reviewed the financial problems faced by 
Gulf Air last year.  At the time, Bahrain had offered to buy 
out its partners in Oman and the UAE, but in the end all 
three had injected cash into the company.  Acknowledging that 
Abu Dhabi\'s vigorous promotion of Etihad Airways added a new 
complication for Gulf Air, the Minister said that Bahrain had 
a national interest in shoring up Gulf Air in order to ensure 
job security for the 3,000 Bahrainis that work for it.  He 
admitted that Bahrain could do a better job of managing the 
airline on its own, and said Bahrain remains interested in 
making the airline its national carrier.  If it went that 
way, sorting out regional routes would be a major challenge.

4.  (SBU) The Ambassador raised Boeing,s interest in helping 
Gulf Air replace its fleet.  The Minister said that he 
preferred to work with Boeing and pointed out that Manama 
airport was host to the region,s only Boeing certified 
mechanics.  When replacing the King,s personal aircraft, he 
decided to purchase a VIP-configured Boeing 737.  The 
Minister said that Boeing should consider investing in a 
serious presence in Bahrain, including regional offices or 
the installation of a flight simulator at the Manama Airport. 
 The Ambassador said that Boeing,s regional representative 
had informed him that he planned to travel to Bahrain in the 
coming weeks.

SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST ARRESTED FOR \"INSTIGATING 
HATRED\" 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe for 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Two controversial speeches delivered at 
the Al Aruba Club this past weekend created a political storm 
in Bahrain, resulting in the closure of the club and the 
arrest of a prominent human rights activist.  The first 
speech was delivered by an Iraqi Baathist who claimed that 
Kuwait was still part of a Iraq.  Both the King and MFA 
officials told us that the speech could harm relations with 
its GCC neighbor and led to GOB\'s decision to close the club. 
 A day later, former Executive Director of Bahrain Centre for 
Human Rights (BCHR) delivered a speech in which he criticized 
the Prime Minister\'s stewardship of the national economy. 
This speech led to his arrest on charges of public incitement 
against the regime and spreading rumors that could disrupt 
national security.  Although the GOB insists that the Aruba 
Club was closed due to the damage caused by the Baathist\'s 
speech, the GOB closed the club only after direct criticism 
of the Prime Minister.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  On September 25 at 10:30 p.m. the police summoned 
former BCHR Executive Director Abdulhadi Al Khawaja to the 
Nabeeh Saleh police station for questioning.  Upon arrival at 
the station he was arrested and detained.  A close friend of 
Al Khawaja, Adel Al Abbasi told PolOff on September 25 that 
Al Khawaja was allowed a telephone call to his family but he 
had no access to legal counsel.  Al Khawaja\'s wife informed 
BCHR board members that Al Khawaja could be detained up to 45 
days.  Concerned citizens and BCHR volunteers quickly 
gathered outside the police station. 
 
3.  (C)  BCHR President Nabeel Rajab told EmbOffs on 
September 26 that the police transferred Al Khawaja to Howdh 
Aljaf, a former detention center in Muharraq (near Bahrain 
International Airport).  Upon his arrival at the center, Al 
Khawaja called his wife to announce that he was going on a 
hunger strike.  According to Rajab, authorities arrested Al 
Khawaja for criticizing the Prime Minister for contributing 
to the current level of poverty in the country.  Al Khawaja 
made his remarks during the BCHR\'s symposium held at the Al 
Aruba Club on September 24.  BCHR has since launched an 
e-mail campaign for the release of Al Khawaja and in support 
of freedom of expression. 
 
4.  (C)  On September 26, 50 supporters of Al Khawaja 
demonstrated outside the Public Prosecutor\'s Office.  Al 
Khawaja\'s wife went to the detention center to provide him 
with a change of clothing but was denied entrance to the 
facility.  On September 25, Bahrain\'s authority over clubs, 
the General Organization for Youth and Sports (GOYS) closed 
the Al Aruba Club for 45 days.  In its September 26 press 
release, the GOYS stated that the Al Aruba Club had been 
guilty of repeated administrative violations. 
 
5.  (C)  On September 26, MFA Minister of State Mohammed 
Abdul Ghaffar requested a meeting with the Ambassador to 
discuss the closure of the Al Aruba Club.  The Minister 
attributed the club\'s closure to a September 23 presentation 
given by Iraqi Baathist Aouni Al Kalamji who said that Kuwait 
rightfully was a part of Iraq. Shortly after his speech, Al 
Kalamji left Bahrain.  The Minister elaborated that Al 
Kalamji is a well-known Baathist who had fled Iraq in the 
1990s in opposition to Saddam, but had returned to Iraq a 
couple of years before the recent Iraq war and had been 
welcomed by the Saddam government. 
 
6.  (C)  Abdul Ghaffar explained that there were two problems 
with Al Kalamji\'s remarks.  First, he crossed the line of 
acceptability in Bahrain by so blatantly offending the 
Kuwaitis and harming relations between the two countries. 
(Abdul Ghaffar noted that he met with the Kuwaiti Ambassador 
the day before to express his regret.)   Second, the Al Aruba 
Club, which is not registered as a political society, crossed 
the line by sponsoring a speaker who delivered such a 
political message. The club violated the societies law under 
which it was established, and was therefore punished. The 
Minister stressed that this measure would have no impact on 
the democratization process. The Al Aruba Club broke the law 
and the GOB enforced it. 
 
7.  (C)  When the Ambassador asked about BCHR\'s September 24 
symposium on poverty at the Al Aruba Club and the subsequent 
arrest of Al Khawaja, the Minister seemed uninformed about 
this incident and quickly made a phone call to get details. 
After receiving a brief report, the Minister clarified that 
Al Khawaja had been arrested for \"instigating hatred.\"  He 
had no further details.  The Ambassador cautioned that any 
move against a human rights figure would invite USG scrutiny 
and gives the Al Aruba Club case an added human rights 
dimension as well. 
8.  (C)  In a September 27 meeting with General Abizaid and 
the Ambassador, the King said he closed the Aruba Club 
because it was a base for Baathists.  The King stated that 
the club had been under surveillance for some time and the 
GOB had been waiting for club management to take a misstep. 
He said he would not allow platforms that would hurt the 
interests of Bahrain\'s neighbors and friends.  He was 
concerned about sectarianism in Bahrain, and did not want 
either extremist Sunni or Shi\'a ideologies to spread, saying 
it would \"plant the roots of a civil war.\"  It was time for 
Bahrain to say \"no\" to demagogues. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) We believe the real reason Al Khawaja was arrested is 
his explicit criticism of the Prime Minister\'s stewardship of 
the national economy.  In these early stages of political and 
economic reform, previously understood red lines have become 
blurred, and many civil society activists are anxious to push 
the limits.  With its tough response, the GOB has clearly 
signaled that personal attacks on the Prime Minister, a 
leading member of Bahrain\'s royal family and the King\'s 
uncle, would not be tolerated. 
 
10.  (C) Just one day before Al Khawaja\'s seminar on poverty, 
the Crown Prince presided over a splashy conference on 
proposed labor reform in the Kingdom.  Ministers, business 
people, regional officials, and international experts 
attended and participated in the event, which was broadcast 
live on Bahraini television.  Its message of the need for 
economic reform and international competitiveness is not at 
all that different from Al Khawaja\'s criticism of the 
economy.  But Al Khawaja\'s personalization of the issue 
vis-a-vis the Prime Minister, and his exploration of the 
sectarian aspects of poverty (i.e. Bahrain\'s majority Shi\'a 
are much poorer than its minority Sunni), went too far in the 
GOB\'s view.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) On September 23, Crown Prince Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa 
and the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) held a 
widely publicized public workshop on labor reform.  A 
politically potent issue, it was the first time the 
government openly addressed the employment challenges Bahrain 
faces.  A McKinsey and Company report commissioned by the GOB 
was the basis for much of the discussion.  It cited a jobless 
rate of 12 to 16 percent and recommended labor reform that 
would create incentives to hire Bahraini workers instead of 
expatriates.  The Crown Prince has promised labor reform as 
part of a comprehensive \"national economic plan\" and we 
expect this to be one of a series of both public and internal 
government consultations on reform.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Straight Talk on Labor Reform 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) On September 23 the Crown Prince\'s Court and the 
Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) held a workshop on 
labor reform, led by the Crown Prince himself.  At the 
workshop the Crown Prince promised a comprehensive \"national 
economic plan\" that would include labor and education reform. 
 He also pledged that any new labor policy would not be 
implemented without consultation with and notice to the 
private sector.  This has been billed as the first in a 
series of public and private government consultations on 
labor reform. 
 
3.  (U) The press widely covered the event and the workshop 
was aired on Bahrain TV along with two documentary films on 
the plight of Bahrain,s poor and unemployed.  One well known 
commentator remarked in his editorial column that the 
openness with which the workshop was conducted and the frank 
nature of the discussion made it seem more like an opposition 
event than one put on by the government. 
 
4. (C) Given the politically sensitive nature of 
unemployment, it is not surprising that the Bahrain Monetary 
Agency (BMA) has never published official unemployment 
figures for Bahraini citizens.  They do publish the number of 
employed annually, but that figure does not differentiate 
between Bahraini and expatriate workers.  Using those numbers 
the jobless rate would be at 5 to 6 percent, a rate that does 
not comport with reality.  It was the Crown Prince who in 
2002 was the first high-level government official to publicly 
admit that Bahraini unemployment was closer to 15 percent. 
 
---------------------------------- 
McKinsey,s Report Becomes Baseline 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Much of the discussion on September 23 focused on the 
analysis and recommendations of a McKinsey and Company report 
commissioned by the EDB and the \"Workshop Pre-Reading\" 
summary of the report distributed before the workshop. 
McKinsey,s report estimates Bahraini unemployment at 12 to 
16 percent, a fall in average real wages of 19 percent over 
the last ten years, widespread under-employment, and low job 
satisfaction.  The report also warns jobs must be found for 
the 100,000 new workers they expect in the market during the 
next decade. 
 
6. (U) The report calls current reliance on the public sector 
for employment unsustainable, cites the need for a 
comprehensive reform, sees the private sector as the engine 
for growth, and says the first step is to make Bahraini labor 
more attractive to the private sector.  The report criticizes 
current GOB labor policies, saying that barring expatriate 
workers from changing jobs has created a pool of low-wage 
expatriates willing to work long hours for less in order to 
stay in Bahrain.  The report also criticizes the GOB\'s 
\"Bahrainization\" policy, which requires companies to hire a 
target number of Bahraini employees.  The policy achieves the 
goal of more Bahrainis employed but also has more serious 
negative consequences including unneeded \"ghost workers\" and 
government micro-management of the labor market. 
 
------------------------ 
The McKinsey Reform Plan 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Recommendations for labor reform discussed at the 
workshop focused on the need to introduce incentives to hire 
Bahraini workers.  McKinsey,s plan would put quotas on the 
number of expatriate workers and impose employer paid entry 
fees (adjustable based on market demands) that could 
effectively raise the cost of recruiting expatriates by 100 
percent by 2009.  Fees collected would go into an account 
that would be used to train Bahrainis.  Bahrainization quotas 
would be removed and expatriates would be permitted to move 
freely from job to job in the market.  (Note:  The Crown 
Prince told the Ambassador, per reftel, that the monthly fee 
would be about USD250 per month, and all expatriate workers, 
including household help would be affected.  End Note.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The workshop was important as the opening salvo in 
what should be a series of public and private consultations 
to help the government get reform right.  While we clearly 
cannot take credit for the Crown Prince,s energetic efforts 
at reform, the implementation of the recently signed Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) does provide Bahrain,s leadership with 
some cover as it makes necessary but hard choices. 
9. (C) In starting with labor reform the Crown Prince is 
tackling an important political issue and acknowledging that 
the creation of a highly skilled work force is crucial to 
Bahrain,s future.  However, banking on the idea that an 
increase in the price of expatriate labor will not 
significantly impact the pocketbooks of a Citibank or Chevron 
enough to discourage them is risky, particularly as Bahrain 
bids to compete for foreign investment in a vibrant regional 
market.  These reforms will have to be part of a strategy 
that includes significant investment incentives.  The reforms 
also do not address who will take on the low-wage work in the 
absence of expatriate workers nor the dissatisfaction 
expressed by Bahrainis with the jobs they now have.

REF: STATE 184238 
 
1.  Expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing 
(ATC) will likely have a small negative impact on the 
Bahraini economy because the textile and apparel sector is a 
relatively minor contributor to the gross domestic product. 
However, the potential for layoffs in the textile sector is a 
potent political issue because of the preponderance of Shia 
women among the approximately 3,700 Bahrainis employed in the 
apparel sector.  Unemployment has traditionally had a 
disproportionate impact on the Shia community, which 
represents some 70 percent of the country\'s population.  Some 
Bahrainis believe that the recently signed U.S.-Bahrain Free

1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  The arrest of prominent human rights 
activist Abdulhadi Al Khawaja continues to dominate the 
public\'s attention in Bahrain. Some oppositionists and NGO 
representatives who support Al Khawaja have been cautious in 
their public statements for fear that outspokenness could 
work against him.  Privately, they appreciated that Al 
Khawaja said what he did regarding the Prime Minister\'s 
mismanagement of the economy.  Other civil society advocates, 
intellectuals and businessmen felt that Al Khawaja went too 
far in his personal criticism of the Prime Minister and 
supported the government\'s action.  Many organizations have 
taken out advertisements in the official press lauding the 
accomplishments of the royal family, the Prime Minister, and 
the government.  A palace source told us that Al Khawaja\'s 
statement on poverty in Bahrain caused tension between the 
Prime Minister and the Crown Prince, who had just launched a 
labor reform initiative characterized as a step in addressing 
Bahrain\'s economic future (Ref A). The international human 
rights community has shown strong support for Al Khawaja as 
evidenced by the public statements. However, a demonstration 
September 28 attracted only a modest turnout of some 100 
people and a second demonstration has been called for October 
1 following Friday prayers.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
Update of Al Khawaja\'s Case 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On September 27, the Public Prosecutor\'s Office 
announced that human rights activist Abdulhadi Al Khawaja was 
charged with Article 165 of the penal code, public incitement 
against the regime, and Article 168, for spreading rumors 
that could disrupt national security.  If found guilty, these 
charges carry two and three year prison sentences 
respectively.  Al Khawaja\'s attorney Ahmed Al Arayed told 
PolOff on September 26 that the Public Prosecutor decided to 
detain Al Khawaja for the full 45 days, allowing the GOB 
ample time to develop a case against him and to transcribe 
audiotapes of Al Khawaja\'s speech on poverty at the Aruba 
Club on September 24.  On September 28, Arabic daily Akhbar 
Al Khaleej stated that a Ministry of Justice official refuted 
Al Arayed\'s claim he had been denied access to Al Khawaja. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Al Khawaja Supporters Cautious in Public... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Civil society activists are disassociating 
themselves from Al Khawaja\'s criticism of the Prime Minister 
and instead are focusing on the issues he raised, poverty and 
equitable economic development.  In a September 27 article in 
London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat, lead opposition society 
Al Wifaq President Shaikh Ali Salman clarified that calling 
for the Prime Minister\'s resignation is not part of Al 
Wifaq\'s agenda and has no impact on the dialogue between the 
opposition societies and the GOB.  He echoed these sentiments 
at the September 26 National Democratic Action Society (NDAS) 
seminar on the political societies law.  In his opening 
remarks Shaikh Ali motioned to an empty chair at the head 
table with Al Khawaja\'s picture mounted on it.  Shaikh Ali 
said it was unfortunate that a colleague had been detained 
because he would have been a valuable contributor on this 
topic, but said nothing more. 
 
---------------------------------- 
...And Private Commentary is Mixed 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Some Sunni and Shi\'a civil society contacts are 
privately critical of the PM\'s management of the economy and 
are concerned about Al Khawaja\'s status.  In a series of 
private conversations, PolOff learned the following.  NDAS 
Board Chairman Abdulrahman Mohamed Al Noaimi said that it is 
a sad day when a human rights activist gets jailed for 
speaking his mind.  Al Noaimi fears that the GOB will make an 
example of Al Khawaja and prosecute him to the fullest 
extent.  President of Mustaqbal Society Shoala Shakeeb 
supported Al Khawaja\'s statements, saying that any action to 
publicize society\'s ills is good.  Secretary General of the 
GCC Arbitration Center Dr. Aziz Abul stated that Al Khawaja 
finally said out loud what many had been thinking for years, 
that the PM had failed in managing the economy and should 
leave office.  Al Wifaq Human Rights Committee Chairman Adel 
Al Abbasi said plainly that the Prime Minister is to blame 
for Shi\'a poverty and unemployment. 
 
5.  (C) At the same time, other Embassy contacts have said 
that Al Khawaja knowingly crossed a red line, personal 
criticism of the Prime Minister.  One Shi\'a contact who comes 
from the same village as Al Khawaja criticized his use of a 
fragment from a Shi\'a prayer calling for the removal, widely 
interpreted as death, of someone harming or interfering with 
the progress of the Shi\'a community.  Others have said that 
Al Khawaja unnecessarily introduced sectarianism into the 
issue of poverty, distribution of income and wealth, and 
economic development.  Another perspective we have heard from 
numerous Embassy contacts is that people are angry with Al 
Khawaja because his statements provoked a response by the 
government that could lead to a lessening of political space 
for everyone. 
 
6.  (C) The national press during the past few days has 
repeated the King\'s calls for national unity and rejecting 
divisiveness.  The official press has filled page after page 
with descriptions of the accomplishments of the King, the 
Prime Minister, and the government.  In the September 29 
editions of leading papers Akhbar Al Khaleej and Al Ayyam, 18 
clubs and organizations sponsored a full-page ad lauding the 
Prime Minister\'s leadership role in the government. 
(Comment:  Many of these entities may have been encouraged to 
participate in the ad by the government body responsible for 
their registration, the General Organization for Youth and 
Sport.  End Comment.) 
 
--------------------- 
Tension at the Palace 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  A palace insider told us privately that the King, 
Crown Prince and Prime Minister had a heated discussion on 
September 26 about the Crown Prince\'s labor initiative and 
participants\' criticism of the state of the Bahraini economy. 
 They report that the Prime Minister felt that the Crown 
Prince\'s remarks failed to recognize the achievements of the 
economy during the Prime Minister\'s 30 years in office and 
had created an atmosphere that emboldened an \"Al Khawaja\" to 
criticize the Prime Minister. Following a \"closing of the 
ranks,\" the King uncharacteristically presided over the 
Cabinet\'s weekly meeting and paid rich tribute to the role 
the Prime Minister has played in realizing the GOB\'s 
economic, social and political achievements. In turn, the 
Prime Minister hailed the Crown Prince\'s effort in 
identifying labor market issues. On September 27, daily Al 
Ayyam featured photos of the threesome together smiling. 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Community\'s Reaction 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch 
issued statements of concern for Al Khawaja. On September 26, 
the Arab Program for Human Rights issued a statement of 
solidarity with him. On September 27, the Observatory for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defense, the Federation for 
International Human Rights and the World Organization Against 
Torture issued a joint statement in support of Al Khawaja. 
 
---------------------- 
Peaceful Demonstration 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (C) On September 28, about 100 people gathered in front 
of the Bahrain Center shopping mall to protest Al Khawaja\'s 
arrest.  Speakers emphasized the importance of freedom of 
speech and expression.  The crowd chanted, \"Free Al Khawaja\" 
and \"Free speech is now a crime.\"  Another demonstration in 
support of Al Khawaja is scheduled October 1 after Friday 
prayers starting at the Shi\'a Ras Ruman Mosque and proceeding 
four blocks to the Prime Ministry. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  While opinion is mixed about Al Khawaja and what he 
said, many of our Bahrain contacts are saddened that the GOB 
felt the need to silence him by putting him in jail.  Al 
Khawaja\'s supporters meanwhile are calibrating their public 
comments so as not to harm his legal status.  They therefore 
now are speaking publicly about the issues - poverty and 
economic development - but not the personalities - Al Khawaja 
and the Prime Minister.

SUBJECT: GOB SHUTS DOWN HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER 
 
REF: MANAMA 1482 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  On September 28 at 22:30, the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs (MOLSA) sent a press release to Bahraini 
newspapers announcing the closure and dissolution of the 
Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) for \"actions that 
contravened the Law of Societies and the Center\'s own 
charter.\"  The GOB had not informed BCHR President Nabeel 
Rajab prior to issuing the press release and he learned about 
the action when journalists called to ask his reaction. He 
immediately instructed BCHR staffers to retrieve the Center\'s 
training materials before the GOB locked the doors. 
 
2. (C) Charge met September 29 with Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar and registered our 
concern about closing the BCHR and the importance of freedom 
of expression in a democratic society.  Without making 
specific reference Al-Khawaja\'s remarks at the BCHR forum, 
Abdul Ghaffar defended the government\'s action saying the 
BCHR was chartered specifically as a research and 
documentation center and it had overstepped the bounds of the 
rules governing its establishment. 
 
3.  (C)  Rajab told PolOff that the GOB\'s action against the 
Center was undoubtedly linked to the Al Khawaja arrest case. 
Al Khawaja is a prominent member of the BCHR and had 
delivered his remarks on poverty in Bahrain during a 
BCHR-sponsored event.  Rajab noted that he had given 
interviews during the two days since Al Khawaja\'s arrest to 
satellite television stations Al Hurra and Al Jazirah as well 
as Radio Sawa and he was careful to limit his comments to the 
issues of Al Khawaja\'s arrest and poverty in the Kingdom, and 
not attack the Prime Minister in any way.  He added that he 
did not know what to do next and was unsure whether he could 
pursue a legal case. (Note: Radio Sawa correspondent told PAO 
today that during her interview with Rajab, he clearly 
denounced the Prime Minister by name.  The correspondent 
decided not to air Rajab\'s comments in order to protect him. 
End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Trafficking in Persons Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  Rajab mentioned that the closure forced him to cease 
immediately the BCHR\'s rescue and assistance activities for 
distressed housemaids.  BCHR has played a central role in 
developing a response system for housemaids and other 
expatriate laborers in crisis, even serving as the primary 
civil society contact for the GOB inter-ministerial committee 
on trafficking in persons.  He added that BCHR\'s Migrant 
Workers Group volunteers are housing several runaway 
housemaids.  Without their affiliation with a licensed NGO, 
they have no legal standing for helping these women.  He also 
mentioned his fear that the Center\'s bank account would be 
seized. Earlier in 2004, the Center raised $80,000 (BD30,000) 
to establish a victim abuse shelter. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
The closure and dissolution of the Bahrain Center for Human 
Rights represents a setback for civil society advocates and 
has sent a pointed message to potential critics of the 
government\'s leadership.  For many Bahrainis, Sunni and Shia 
alike, Al Khawaja and BCHR\'s Nabeel Rajab went a step too far 
with inevitable results.  But the sectarian specter has 
reared its head in this saga (both are Shia), demonstrating 
the delicate line the Bahraini leadership feels it must walk 
as they pursue democratic reform and widen political space.

KING, CROWN PRINCE, DEFENSE MINISTER 
 
 
Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Commander U.S. Central Command General Abizaid met 
with King Hamad, Crown Prince Salman, and Defense Minister 
Khalifa on September 27 to discuss Iraq and the upcoming 
elections there, the need for full Sunni participation in the 
election, Iranian interference in Iraq, and the situations in 
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.  The King stated that the United 
States had achieved its mission in Iraq and should pull its 
forces out of the country as soon as possible after the 
elections so that Iraqis could settle their differences 
themselves.  In contrast with this view, the Crown Prince and 
Defense Minister both stressed the need for the U.S. to 
remain in Iraq until the security situation was stabilized. 
Regarding Sunni participation in the elections, the CP 
suggested the U.S. support the launch of a reconciliation 
campaign.  All the General\'s interlocutors believed that Iran 
represents a great danger in Iraq and in the region.  The 
Bahrainis stressed the value of the U.S.-Bahrain mil-mil 
relationship and look forward to strengthening the bilateral 
ties.  They believe that Saudi Arabia is making progress in 
the fight against domestic militants.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) In meetings September 27 with King Hamad bin Isa Al 
Khalifa, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, and 
Defense Minister Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, Commander U.S. 
Central Command General Abizaid focused his discussions on 
the situation in Iraq and the upcoming elections there.  He 
stated that the United States was committed to remaining in 
Iraq as long as necessary, but was working closely with the 
Interim Iraqi Government (IIG) to appoint loyal senior 
military leaders so that Iraqis could take the lead in 
combating the insurgency.  Abizaid pointed out the danger of 
Iranian meddling in Iraqi internal politics and the downsides 
of general Sunni intransigence and hesitation about 
participating in the elections.  He emphasized continuing 
strong U.S. support for Bahrain and defense of the Kingdom. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Contrasting Advice on U.S. Forces in Iraq 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) King Hamad stated that the United States had 
accomplished its objectives in Iraq, removing Saddam and 
settling the WMD issue, and it now should plan to depart Iraq 
as soon as possible following the Iraqi elections.  He 
asserted that Iraqis were now relying upon the U.S. to settle 
their differences and offer solutions, thus absolving Iraqis 
themselves from any responsibility.  This situation was 
unhealthy for both the U.S. and Iraq.  The King acknowledged 
that Iraqis likely would fight each other following an 
American departure, but not for an extended period.  He said 
that if they identified the right leaders, the country could 
move in the right direction.  While division of the country 
was a possibility, this was a matter for Iraqis to decide. 
The United States could still maintain a robust presence in 
the region, with bases both inside Iraq and in other Gulf 
countries, and this would send the strong message that 
regional stability and development were strategic U.S. 
interests. 
 
4.  (C) In contrast with the King\'s comments, Crown Prince 
Salman and Defense Minister Khalifa strongly urged the United 
States to remain in Iraq for the foreseeable future.  The CP 
said that the U.S. should offer comprehensive support for 
Iraq - military, economic, and political.  He recommended 
that the U.S. engage with traditional local power structures, 
such as influential tribes in the rural areas.  He suggested 
that the U.S. had lost an opportunity by disbanding the 
former Iraqi military.  The U.S. now should be working 
closely with the IIG to appoint senior military leaders loyal 
to the new government.  The Defense Minister said that the 
U.S. role was indispensable and that if it withdrew from Iraq 
now, there would be civil war the next day. 
 
--------------- 
Iraqi Elections 
--------------- 
 
5.  (C) The King stressed that elections in Iraq should 
proceed as planned, saying \"one delay will lead to another.\" 
He cautioned that Iraq is not ready for a \"real democracy,\" 
and the results of completely open elections in Iraq would 
not be in the long-term interest of Iraq or the United 
States.  In his view, Iraq can currently absorb some 
democracy, but commitment to true democratic ideals could 
take time. 
 
6.  (C) The Crown Prince said that the United States should 
support the development of a reconciliation program in Iraq 
to encourage Sunnis to participate in the elections.  The 
message should focus on the future and what benefits the 
Sunnis would derive from full participation.  Abizaid said 
that the intimidation power of the Baathists within the Sunni 
community was still very strong, and others were looking 
toward Zarqawi.  The Sunni community had a great opportunity 
to move forward, but it could find itself marginalized if 
they missed this chance.  He warned that any Iraqi choosing 
to support Zarqawi and his extremists would become a 
permanent enemy of the United States.  Defense Minister 
Khalifa downplayed the significance of the threat posed by 
residents of the Sunni triangle, saying that Iran was 
ultimately a much more lethal danger. 
 
------------------------ 
Iranian Meddling In Iraq 
------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) The three Bahraini leaders agreed that Iran 
represents a great danger in Iraq and the region.  The Crown 
Prince said that Iran\'s ideology is that of \"horribly 
inhumane terrorists\" that has no future, resulting ultimately 
in \"repulsing\" people.  The Defense Minister commented that 
the United States tends to see a difference between the IRGC 
and Khatemi, but in his view the two groups have a shared 
strategy, the only difference is in their tactics.  Abizaid 
noted that Iran was playing a more active role in Iraq now 
than it did one year ago. 
 
8.  (C) The Crown Prince commented that Syria seemed to have 
no idea about what was happening on its border with Iraq. 
Abizaid indicated that Syria was playing a dangerous game in 
Iraq.  There were indications that Syria was assisting the 
insurgents while the insurgents were cooperating with the 
extremists.  If the Syrian government did not pay close 
enough attention, it might find itself dealing with a 
challenge from these same extremists at some point. 
 
------------------------- 
Bahrain As Regional Model 
------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) The King emphasized that Bahrain was proud to host 
NAVCENT Headquarters and welcomed U.S. visitors to the 
Kingdom.  Bahrain had implemented a number of political and 
economic reforms, and could serve as a model for other Gulf 
countries.  When Bahraini citizens complain that the country 
is not moving in the right direction, the King replies that 
they have the option to run for office and argue their point 
of view.  The King wants to develop institutions independent 
of any particular ideology or sect.  He asserted that Bahrain 
would like to host a meeting of G8 and regional foreign 
ministers in January to discuss the Broader Middle East/North 
Africa Initiative.  He commented that other Arabs had good 
words, but Bahrain had good deeds. 
 
10.  (C) In response to the General\'s question, the Crown 
Prince said Bahrain would prosecute the four terrorism 
suspects.  The Ministry of Interior was working hard on the 
issue, though the Bahrain National Security Agency and the 
Attorney General\'s office needed to be improved.  The CP 
noted that under current Bahraini law, the maximum penalty 
for conspiracy to commit a crime was three years, and the 
suspects deserved to remain in prison much longer than that. 
The new draft counter-terrorism law proposed significantly 
more severe penalties for conspiracy to carry out terrorist 
attacks.  The Crown Prince mentioned that the suspect who 
fled the courtroom during his hearing in early September 
would face additional charges and would be held longer. 
 
11.  (C) The Crown Prince cited the strength of the 
U.S.-Bahrain bilateral relationship and recognized quick 
negotiation of the free trade agreement.  He thanked the 
military for reopening the DOD Bahrain School.  Noting that 
his children attend the school, he said he felt confident 
that it was safe and secure.  He requested that the teachers 
be permitted to bring their families back to Bahrain. 
 
------------------- 
Mil-Mil Cooperation 
------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Regarding military cooperation, Abizaid suggested 
that Bahrain develop a capability as a regional center for 
excellence, perhaps in simulator training.  Defense Minister 
Al Khalifa replied that the simulator project was on the 
right track but he was not yet ready for a purchase.  Abizaid 
noted that the U.S. was working with Jordan to establish a 
special forces training center, and the Minister stated that 
Bahrain holds annual joint special forces exercises with 
Jordan and the two sides benefit from the interaction. 
 
13.  (C) The Defense Minister expressed great concern about 
Iranian ballistic missile developments.  Though the Shahab 
missile is not accurate, its range, combined with Iran\'s 
focus on a nuclear program, was disturbing.  He said Iran is 
desperate to have a nuclear weapon, and there needed to be 
plans to ensure they do not get it.  Abizaid responded that 
all options were on the table in dealing with the Iranian 
nuclear threat.  The United States wanted to work with Gulf 
countries to develop a regional ballistic missile defense 
system. 
 
-------------------------- 
Saudi Arabia Fighting Hard 
-------------------------- 
 
14.  (C) Regarding Saudi Arabia, the King said that the 
government was fighting the terrorists to the best of its 
ability.  It had waited too long to recognize the threat but 
was now dealing with it seriously.  The Defense Minister 
indicated that Bahrain and Saudi Arabia enjoy excellent 
cooperation at the border and are developing closer links for 
sharing information.  Abizaid told the Crown Prince that many 
of the foreign fighters and suicide bombers in Iraq were 
Saudi.  He worried that as the security situation in Iraq 
stabilized, the Saudis would return to their country and 
might cause trouble there.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S VISIT TO 
BAHRAIN OCTOBER 9-10 
 
Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S) Mr. Secretary, we warmly welcome you to Bahrain. 
While the genesis of your trip is meeting with Operation 
Iraqi Freedom coalition Ministers of Defense on the aircraft 
carrier John F. Kennedy, your visit comes at an important 
time in our bilateral relationship with Bahrain.  The mil-mil 
relationship spanning some 50 years experienced a rare hiccup 
last summer when the U.S. grew concerned about Bahraini 
resolve in pursuing a small group of dangerous terrorist 
suspects.  Bahrainis were shocked by the departure of Navy 
dependents, issuance of a U.S. travel warning, and the 
threatened closure of the DOD Bahrain School, to which many 
senior Bahraini officials send their children and which 
counts Crown Prince Salman among its alumni. 
 
2.  (S) Several positive developments have occurred since 
then.  The Bahrainis rearrested the six and continue to 
detain the four most dangerous of them.  The State Department 
lifted the travel warning and DOD agreed to continue 
operating the Bahrain School, enabling it to open on time for 
the school year.  The United States and Bahrain also signed a 
free trade agreement (FTA), the first with a Gulf state and 
only the third in the Arab world. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Deep U.S. Concern About Prosecuting Extremists 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (S) There are, nonetheless, lingering concerns on both 
sides.  We remain concerned about the status of the case 
against the four remaining detainees and we continue to urge 
the GOB to conduct a robust investigation and prosecution, 
which would send the right message on the GOB\'s commitment to 
combating terrorism.  Bahrain is proud to host NAVCENT 
Headquarters, and is apprehensive that the continued 
departure of Navy dependents as well as regional and global 
force posture reviews may portend further changes in the 
Navy\'s profile in Bahrain. 
 
4.  (S) While Bahrain\'s people have not been immune to the 
waves of anti-Americanism present in the region - daily 
pictures in newspapers and on television have had an impact - 
the leadership has remained steadfast in its support for the 
United States and for its bilateral relationship with the 
USG.  It has openly championed the FTA as the key to its 
economic future and continues to embrace the Navy as the key 
to its present and future security. 
 
---------- 
Objectives 
---------- 
 
5.  (S) What we want from the visit: 
 
-- Renewed commitment from the GOB, preferably directly from 
the King, that Bahrain will conduct a thorough investigation 
and prosecution of the four terrorism suspects and send the 
right message on counter-terrorism. 
 
-- An indication of Bahrain\'s long range thinking on the U.S. 
Navy presence in country. 
 
-- Continued Bahrain support, both politically and in 
practical terms, for our efforts in Iraq and Operation 
Enduring Freedom maritime operations. 
 
----------------------------- 
Issues of Interest to Bahrain 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (S) The Bahrainis will want to hear from you on: 
 
-- A reaffirmation of the Navy\'s long-term commitment to 
Bahrain. 
 
-- The path forward on Iraq. 
 
-- Shaken by the events of last summer, Bahrain will welcome 
positive statements on its support for OIF and OEF. 
 
-- Anything you can say about a return, even partial, of Navy 
dependents and your thoughts on the future of the Bahrain 
School. 
 
------------------- 
Key Issues to Raise 
------------------- 
 
7.  (S) We suggest you raise the following key points: 
 
-- Express appreciation for Bahrain\'s hospitality in serving 
as the venue for this event involving Ministers of Defense 
from the coalition in Iraq. 
 
-- Recognize the long history of mil-mil cooperation with 
Bahrain, most notably through hosting NAVCENT. 
 
-- Praise Bahrain\'s support for OEF, OIF, and U.S. policy in 
Iraq, including training for Iraqi financial specialists and 
firefighters. 
 
-- Commend the King\'s steps on political and economic reform 
and his active participation in the G8 Broader Middle East 
and North Africa reform initiative. Note our concern that 
Bahrain keep to this path of reform. 
 
-- Reaffirm the commitment of the U.S. Navy in Bahrain. 
 
-- Stress our concern on counter-terrorism, noting that 
everything we want to do in Bahrain, from military 
cooperation to FTA, depends on close cooperation in this 
area.  Successful prosecution of the remaining four detainees 
will improve the security situation on the ground and send 
the right signal to Al Qaida and the world that Bahrain will 
not tolerate any connection to terrorism on its soil. 
 
 
----------------- 
Issues Background 
----------------- 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
8.  (S) Bahrain supports our goals and role in Iraq.  They 
recognize the critical nature of stabilizing the security 
situation, holding elections and establishing a government 
that represents all of Iraq\'s communities, and preventing 
neighboring countries from meddling in Iraq\'s domestic 
situation.  King Hamad told General Abizaid on September 27 
that U.S. forces should plan to depart Iraq as soon as 
possible following the elections so that Iraq could develop 
its own leaders and not rely upon the United States to deal 
with its problems.  In contrast, Crown Prince Salman and 
Defense Minister Al Khalifa asserted that the U.S. should 
remain in Iraq until the Iraqis are in a position to provide 
security themselves.  All agreed that elections should be 
held without delay and identified Iran as the greatest 
long-term threat to Iraq\'s future. 
 
9.  (S) In addition to hosting NAVCENT, Bahrain deployed 35 
tanks and 1,500 troops to Kuwait during OIF and flew air 
patrols over Kuwait and Bahrain.  They also deployed their 
frigate the Al Sabha during both OIF and OEF.  They are 
considering deploying patrol boats to the northern Arabian 
Gulf should they receive a formal request from the Interim 
Iraqi Government. 
 
Foreign Military Financing 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (S) Bahrain received $24.85 million in FMF grants from 
the FY04 Department of State budget. This brings the FMF 
total over the past three fiscal years to $145 million, 
including funding from the FY02 and FY03 supplementals.  The 
Bahrainis have used these funds to purchase a TPS 59 radar 
(due to arrive late 2006), an infrared countermeasures suite 
for the King\'s new 747-400 (due in 12 months), the 
refurbishment of 14 Cobra helicopters, and multiple spare 
cases for all services.  Due to the military\'s aging 
equipment and growing maintenance costs, the Bahrain Defense 
Force sees FMF as an important means to bridge their budget 
deficits and to sustain readiness. 
 
Security 
-------- 
 
11.  (S) All of Bahrain\'s leaders are adamantly determined to 
maintain security for Americans here.  Whenever we make 
requests for extra security, the police respond immediately 
and appropriately.  The GOB continues to hold the four most 
dangerous of the six terrorism suspects, and we are urging 
the government to conduct a robust investigation and 
prosecution.  The Crown Prince has mentioned a number of 
times that the Minister of Interior, who was appointed during 
the spring, \"gets\" our concerns, but that capacity building 
at the Bahrain National Security Agency (BNSA) and Attorney 
General\'s office requires additional work.  The GOB has 
committed to working with the USG to establish a 
Counter-Terrorism Operations Center and a Counter-Terrorism 
Intelligence Center, though establishment of the latter is 
pending management changes at BNSA.  Parliament will open its 
next session on October 9, the day of your visit, and it is 
expected to consider a draft counter-terrorism law during the 
2004-05 session.  The new law would apply stiff penalties for 
conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. 
 
Democratic Reform 
----------------- 
 
12.  (S) The 2002 constitution established an elected lower 
house of parliament, the Council of Representatives, while 
the upper house, the Consultative Council, is appointed by 
the King.  Due to the breakdown of the process of advancing 
legislation during the 2003-04 legislative session and calls 
for amendments to the constitution, the government and four 
opposition societies are engaged in a \"constitutional 
dialogue\" to resolve their differences. 
13.  (S) In late September, the GOB arrested human rights 
activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja following his comments at a 
forum on poverty in which he reportedly accused the Prime 
Minister of mismanaging the economy during his 30-plus years 
in office.  Days later, the government closed the Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights, which organized the forum, accusing 
it of political activities that contravened the Societies Law 
and the Center\'s own charter.  We have expressed our concern 
with this apparent step backward in the GOB\'s reform process. 
 
Economy 
------- 
 
14.  (S) The United States and Bahrain signed a free trade 
agreement on September 14, marking a new level of commitment 
in our bilateral economic relationship.  Bahrain is the first 
country in the Gulf region to have an FTA with us, and joins 
Jordan and Morocco as the only Arab states with FTAs.  We 
hope to use the Bahrain FTA as a springboard to promote 
economic reform, openness, and transparency in the region, 
and as an important step in realizing the President\'s vision 
of a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013.  Bahrain will cite 
the FTA as the United States\' endorsement of its economy and 
to market Bahrain as a regional center for finance, 
insurance, banking, business services, education, and health 
care. 
 
Middle East Peace 
----------------- 
 
15. (S) The Bahraini government is deeply troubled by the 
continuing violence in Israel and the Palestinian 
territories.  Though far from the conflict, Bahrainis 
identify with the Palestinians.  The Crown Prince has told us 
that he would like to work with the Israeli government, in 
particular in fending off threats from Iran, but he cannot do 
so in the absence of some sort of settlement between Israel 
and the Palestinians.  The Crown Prince appreciates that the 
President has gone far to promote the establishment of a 
viable, independent Palestinian state, but he has asked that 
the Administration make a gesture to relieve the suffering of 
the Palestinian people.  Flare-ups in violence in the 
territories inevitably transfer directly into heightened 
emotions among average Bahrainis.

1.  (C) Pol/Econ Chief October 4 delivered Refs A and B 
information regarding Guantanamo detainee Shaikh Salman 
Ebrahim Mohammed Al Khalifa\'s request for witness testimony 
to MFA Under Secretary Shaikh Abdul Aziz Al Khalifa.  He 
listened carefully to the points and reconfirmed that the 
United States was looking for a mutually agreeable way to 
take written testimony from the two witnesses identified by 
the detainee.  He ruled out the witnesses traveling to either 
the United States or Guantanamo, but thought that, if the 
ministry was successful in locating the witnesses and in 
obtaining their permission, there might be a way for the 
testimony to be provided in Bahrain. 
 
2.  (C) In a follow up conversation on October 5, Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz told Pol/Econ Chief that the MFA had contacted 
both witnesses identified by detainee Shaikh Salman Ebrahim 
Mohammed Al Khalifa and they were willing to do \"all they 
could\" to provide testimony in support of the detainee.  He 
looks forward to hearing from us on next steps regarding 
substance and logistics of the testimony. 
 
3.  (C) In the October 4 meeting, Pol/Econ Chief also briefed 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz on the status of Refs C and D request for 
testimony for detainee Abdullah Al Noaimi.  MFA Director for 
Consular Affairs Yusuf Ahmed had informed us earlier that he 
had spoken with Al Noaimi\'s father about locating Mohammed 
Salman Al Khalifa.  Al Noaimi\'s father had been very 
cooperative, but said that he was unsure precisely who his 
son wanted to provide testimony. 
 
4.  (C) In the October 5 follow up conversation, Shaikh Abdul 
Aziz told Pol/Econ Chief that a member of his staff had 
contacted the father a second time and the father had said 
that his son could have been referring to either Mohammed 
Salman Al Khalifa or Ahmed Salman Al Khalifa.  The father 
believes that his son was more likely interested in Ahmed 
Salman Al Khalifa\'s testimony because they have a very close 
friendship and they had studied together.  While the son also 
has a relationship with Mohammed Salman Al Khalifa, they are 
not as close.  According to the father, Ahmed Salman Al 
Khalifa himself believes that the detainee would more likely 
want his testimony.  In any case, the father assured Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz that both men are willing to provide testimony on 
behalf of Abdullah Al Noaimi.

(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  SecDef met with Bahrain King Hamad Bin Issa 
Al Khalifa on October 09, 2004, in Bahrain.  The King made 
the following points:  (1) The ultimate responsibility for 
the security of Iraq rests with the Iraqis, not the U.S.  (2) 
Reaffirmed Bahrain\'s commitment to support the U.S. both in 
country and the region and offered to do more in Iraq.  (3) 
Saudi Arabia is dealing with the threat but needs our 
continued support.  SecDef made the following points: (1) The 
U.S. and Coalition responsibility is to create an environment 
so the Iraqis can take responsibility for the security of 
their county. (2) Acknowledged Bahrain\'s support.  (3) 
Discussed the need for moderate leaders to step up and speak 
the truth.  (4) The Saudis were slow to counter terrorism but 
are doing better now.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Responsibility for Security:  The King said that the 
U.S. had opened the eyes of everyone about what is right. 
\"It is not your job to make the Iraqis succeed; that is up to 
the Iraqi people.\"  He said that the U.S. had accomplished 
its mission.  Iraq is in the hands of the Iraqis.  The U.S. 
did its best by creating the right atmosphere by opening the 
airports, rebuilding the schools, and getting rid of Saddam. 
The U.S. soldiers should not be patrolling the streets of 
Baghdad; the Iraqis should.  SecDef said the U.S. only has 
the responsibility to create an environment so the Iraqis can 
take care of themselves. 
 
3.  (C) Bahrain\'s Commitment to the U.S.:  The King said 
Bahrain is committed to the U.S.  He said Bahrain needs 
stability to maintain its political and economic development. 
 He said Bahrain has made good progress on reform relative to 
the region but not compared to the rest of the world.  The 
King said that Bahrain has an open society -- where people 
can speak freely provided they follow the law -- and they can 
demonstrate peacefully.  However, the people have never 
demonstrated against the U.S. Navy in the last five years. 
SecDef said that he was appreciative of the support that 
Bahrain has given the U.S. fleet and the Iraqis. 
 
4. (C) Saudi Arabia:  The King said that he was worried about 
the security in the region, and particularly about Saudi 
Arabia.  He said there would be a problem if the radicals 
took over the Kingdom.  \"We do our best to support the Saudi 
Government and their efforts.\"  SecDef said the Saudis had 
been slow to get engaged.  When the attacks happened they 
were not ready and they are still not particularly well 
trained or equipped, although they are improving. 
 
5. (C) Moderate Muslim Leaders:  SecDef said that there need 
to be more moderate leaders, such as the Bahrainis, who stand 
up against radical leaders.  We need them to tell the truth. 
Karzai, Allawi and Musharraf are leaders in this respect. 
The King said he told clerics that if you speak up against 
the U.S., we can bring you down.  Although in Bahrain, he 
said, the clerics are not that tough. 
 
6.  (U) SecDef has approved this cable.

1.  (C) King Hamad October 9 opened Parliament\'s third 
session since the adoption of the National Charter with a 
speech focusing on the need for unity, dialogue, and 
tolerance in the Kingdom.  The King warned that in-fighting 
puts prosperity at risk and people must find a way to express 
differences of opinion with serenity and courtesy.  The 
message resonates on many levels - within the Arab world, 
Bahraini society, and the Al Khalifa family.  While 
complimenting the Prime Minister for his many 
accomplishments, the King thrust his son Crown Prince Salman 
firmly into the limelight by entrusting him with the 
Kingdom\'s most sensitive political issue, the process of 
discussing amendments to the constitution.  He praised the 
CP\'s work on labor reform, the topic that led to tensions 
between the CP and the Prime Minister last month.  The King 
proposed development of a personal status law based on 
religious values that is well-balanced and moderate. 
Regarding foreign affairs, the King discussed Iraq and the 
Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  End Summary.

--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (C) King Hamad October 9 opened the third parliamentary 
session since the 2002 adoption of the National Charter with 
an address to a joint session of the Council of 
Representatives and the Shura (Consultative) Council.  With 
his uncle Prime Minister Khalifa and son Crown Prince Salman 
flanking him on the dais, the King stated that \"divided 
houses do not make thriving nations\" in the context of 
inter-Arab in-fighting.  However, Bahrainis understood the 
message to be that, in the aftermath of tensions brought on 
by the CP\'s labor reform conference in September and his 
implicit criticism of the PM\'s stewardship of the economy 
over the past 30-plus years, the Al Khalifa family must close 
ranks and avoid conflict. 
 
3.  (C) The point also resonated more broadly within Bahraini 
society, which is marked by a Shia-Sunni demographic divide 
and lately has been dealing with the specter of sectarian 
friction following the late September arrest of civil society 
activist Abdel Hadi Al Khawaja, a critic of the government 
and an advocate for Shia empowerment.  The King continued 
that \"we stress commitment to serenity in dialogues and 
courtesy in divergences of opinions... and consider such 
attributes the core of Bahraini values.\"  This view echoes 
statements made by other leaders, including Shia spiritual 
leader Shaikh Issa Qassem and opposition society Al Wifaq 
President Ali Salman, who called for calming down the 
situation and solidarity within Bahraini society. 
 
---------------------------- 
CP To Lead National Dialogue 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) About one-third of the way into his speech, the King 
spoke of the \"wise government led by our dear uncle\" the PM 
and his great success and achievements.  Moments later the 
King talked about the political and economic reform process 
he has implemented and entrusted the Crown Prince with 
following up on these issues.  Most importantly, he will lead 
the national dialogue, the process of talks between the GOB 
and four opposition political societies on possible 
amendments to the constitution to rationalize and improve the 
efficiency of the legislative process.  (Note:  We understand 
that for now, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Majid Al 
Alawi will continue to head the government team interacting 
directly with the opposition parties, but he will report to 
the CP on the status of the dialogue rather than to the King. 
 End Note.) 
 
5.  (C) The King highlighted the honor of serving in the 
parliament and said, \"there is no substitute or source for 
the development of democracy other than you, the sons and 
representatives of this nation.\"  One contact understood this 
to be a subtle message that changes to the constitution would 
come only through legislative channels, and not by 
oppositionists negotiating directly with the government. 
 
------------------------------------- 
First Step Is Acknowledging A Problem 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The King commended the Crown Prince for his 
chairmanship of the Economic Development Board, citing his 
\"well-studied initiative\" on labor market reform.  The King 
continued that, \"We believe that it takes courage when a 
state informs its people about the problems because that move 
represents the first step towards a solution.  We fully 
support this move, and we stress to the Crown Prince the 
importance of immediate action to prepare, as part of his 
mission, the second line of young leaders who will assume the 
responsibility and carry on the reforms.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
Personal Status Initiative 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The King\'s major new policy initiative was his desire 
for a personal status law.  He stated that it must be a 
flexible law that takes into account religious values, 
protects the rights of women and children, and guides legal 
relations between husband and wife.  He cautioned that the 
law must be drawn from \"our tolerant Islamic values\" and be 
well-balanced and moderate and allow for \"ijtihad,\" the 
interpretation of Islamic principles. 
 
8.  (C) During his October 9 meeting with Defense Secretary 
Rumsfeld, hours after the speech to parliament, the King said 
that he had raised a \"revolutionary idea,\" that women and 
children should rely upon the law for their rights and the 
husband/father was not the absolute authority in their lives. 
 He noted that Bahraini women are prominent in education, 
medicine, and law, and that 56 percent of registered voters 
in the Kingdom are women. 
 
9.  (C) MP Salah Ali, president of the Al Minbar political 
society, a relatively moderate Sunni organization, told 
PolFSN that his parliamentary bloc strongly supports 
development of a personal status law.  Al Minbar had proposed 
a law some two years ago that was harshly criticized by 
leaders in the Shia community, who feared that the law would 
impose Sunni interpretations of Sharia tenets on all 
citizens.  Ali hoped that by stressing flexibility and 
\"ijtihad,\" the King had paved the way for development of a 
law that would be acceptable to all. 
 
--------------- 
Foreign Affairs 
--------------- 
 
10.  (C) The King proudly cited his participation in the G8 
Sea Island Summit last July, saying it was recognition of the 
model that Bahrain represents in the Gulf region.  In a 
possible reference to the Greater Middle East and North 
Africa initiative, the King stated, \"we do not import 
democracy.\"  He stressed that the democratic reform process 
is deeply rooted in the heritage of Bahrain\'s citizens. 
 
11.  (C) The King said that the solution to Iraq\'s problems 
must come from within.  Iraq\'s unity can be maintained 
through democracy, constructive cooperation with its 
neighbors, and openness towards the international community. 
He also raised achieving a comprehensive and just peace in 
the Middle East based on secure borders for all states, 
including an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as 
its capital. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) The King used his address to parliament as a vehicle 
to appeal for unity and calm and to emphasize the need for 
dialogue to resolve differences.  His advice works on many 
levels, from inside his immediate family to the international 
scene.  He also took steps to ensure that his son, the Crown 
Prince, becomes more directly involved in the central 
political issue facing the Kingdom, the national dialogue on 
amending the constitution.  While the King was careful to 
praise the Prime Minister and his accomplishments, the net 
effect of the speech was to push the Crown Prince more firmly 
into the middle of Bahrain\'s political life as a way for him 
to establish his credibility and to prepare for his future 
job.

SUMMARY

1. (S/NF) Minister of the Interior Shaikh Rashid assured the 
Ambassador October 11, 2004 that the four extremists 
currently in detention would appear in court shortly, and 
that he had anticiapted they would be brought to trial.  (On 
October 13, BNSA advised the Embassy that the four will 
continue to be held until November 1, at which time they will 
be brought to court for trial.)  Also during the meeting, the 
Minister discussed this week\'s GCC Interior Ministers meeting 
in Kuwait, during which he met bilaterally with his Saudi 
counterpart.  Shaykh Rashid said Bahrain would take a 
proactive role in GCC security cooperation,including a 
possible follow-on meeting in Manama. The Minister described 
Bahrain as a safe place and assured continuing security 
cooperation between Bahrain and the U.S.  The Minister 
expressed interest in improving Bahrain\'s consequence 
management capability and strengthening the country\'s Coast 
Guard. End Summary.

THE FAMOUS FOUR 
- - - - - - - - 
 
2. (S/NF) During an October 11 call on Minister of Interior 
Shaykh Rashid bin Abdulla al Khalifa, the Ambassador asked 
about the next step for the four extremists whose current 
term of detention was expected to expire this week.  Shaikh 
Rashid advised that the Attorney General will take the case 
to court.  The four will likely be seen by a judge on October 
12 for a hearing. (NOTE: BSNA advised late on October 13 that 
it was decided to extend the detention until November 1, at 
which time they will be brought to court for trial.)  The 
Minister expressed his expectation that the four should be 
kept in jail for some time.  In any event, he added, 
community support for them has dwindled, and they are no 
longer famous.  Shaikh Rashid stated that they have a 
cooperative witness in the group and are monitoring the two 
men who were released last month and the four in custody. 
The Ambassador commented that the men must be brought into 
court and a trial held.  This will send a message to the 
extremist leadership that Bahrain is not a place where 
terrorists can operate.  He further inquired about the 
interrogation of the men while in custody. (NOTE: The 
Attorney General\'s office has not conducted effective 
interrogations of the four men).  The Minister said he was 
transferring one of his senior officers to the Attorney 
General\'s Office to improve performance in that office.  The 
Minister offered to call the Ambassador with news regarding 
the status of the four extremists.

THE GCC MEETING 
- - - - - - - - 
 
3. (S) Shaikh Rashid had returned to Bahrain on October 10 
from a GCC Interior Minister\'s meeting in Kuwait.  He 
described a bilateral meeting with the Saudi Minister of 
Interior regarding security in the Kingdom.  Both countries 
are working together on the terrorism  problem, but it will 
take some time to resolve.  He added that Bahrain and Saudi 
Arabia are cooperating and exchanging information on 
terrorists.  The Saudi Royal family is getting stronger, in 
the Minister\'s opinion, by working with the people.  All GCC 
Ministers agreed to exchange information and demonstrate 
resolve in the fight against terrorism.  Shaikh Rashid 
indicated Bahrain would take a proactive role in GCC 
cooperation on security issues, inculding a probable 
follow-on meeting in Bahrain.

4. (S) The Ambassador underscored the importance of security 
cooperation and sharing intelligence between Bahrain and the 
U.S.  The Minister assured the GoB\'s full support.  Shaikh 
Rashid wants to improve Bahrain\'s consequence management 
capability and strengthen the Coast Guard by adding more 
land, sea and air capability.  RSO reviewed the July 2004 
Coast Guard training program provided by DS/ATA and the 
robust schedule of ATA courses planned in 2004 and 2005. 
Major General Abdul Latif al Zayani mentioned the Deep Water 
Program, designed to integrate existing systems and improve 
the Coast Guard fleet of ships and aircraft.  (NOTE:  Post 
will explore the Deep Water Program and what it can provide 
for the MOI).  The Ambassador thanked the Minister for the 
excellent security support provided for the SECDEF and 18 
Ministers of Defense visit to Bahrain (10/10-11) along with 
the CNO\'s visit (10/11-12).

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Vernon Clark 
met with Crown Prince and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain 
Defense Force Sheikh Salman Bin Hamad Al Khalifa on October 
10 and discussed the status of the Bahrain School, a review 
of U.S. naval presence in the region, terrorism and the 
Arab-Israeli conflict.  The Crown Prince called the Bahrain 
School a tremendous asset and ambassador to the region. 
Clark acknowledged the school\'s importance and focused on the 
worldwide effort to restructure the Navy and review its 
\"footprint\" in the region.  The Crown Prince urged the Navy 
to remain in the region, and praised its role ensuring 
regional stability.  He confirmed Bahrain\'s commitment to 
combat terrorism but said a festering Arab-Israeli conflict 
would continue to draw new recruits.   The Crown Prince also 
reaffirmed Bahrain\'s support for U.S. efforts in Iraq. End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Bahrain School:  Your Best Ambassador 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) CNO Admiral Vernon Clark opened the meeting with the 
Crown Prince and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense 
Force Sheikh Salman Bin Hamad Al Khalifa on October 10 by 
noting he was pleased to see that joint U.S.-Bahraini efforts 
to keep the Bahrain School open had been successful.  The 
Crown Prince called the Bahrain School your \"best ambassador\" 
and urged the Navy to ensure that this tremendous asset in 
the region remains open.  CNO Clark reaffirmed the importance 
of the school and said the Navy wanted to be a good neighbor. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Reviewing the Navy Footprint 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Clark then explained that his trip was part of a 
worldwide review of the Navy\'s \"footprint.\"  The Navy is 
looking to streamline operations in response to budgetary 
constraints, security concerns and new emerging threats.  He 
referred to an increased need for \"near-shore\" operations 
that would include new shallow-water vessels and closer 
cooperation between the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard at 
home and overseas.  The Crown Prince underscored the 
important role the U.S. Navy has played in bringing stability 
to the Gulf, ensuring other tools such as diplomacy and 
development programs to be more effective.  He stressed that 
technical capabilities, while important, should not be the 
only thing the Navy looks at when considering how to be more 
efficient and effective in the Gulf. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Navy Critical to Winning Hearts and Minds 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Throughout the discussion, the Crown Prince focused 
on the need to build relationships with local communities and 
called upon the Navy to remain engaged in Bahrain.  These 
kinds of efforts are critical to \"winning hearts and minds\" 
in the region.  Partnerships such as the Bahrain School 
demonstrate how effective that kind of community involvement 
can be in creating a stable and secure future for all.  Clark 
noted that he appreciated the Crown Prince\'s perspective and 
that this trip was part of an effort to engage partners in 
the region to determine a footprint that was reasonable for 
all. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Terrorism: Arab-Israeli Conflict an Open Sore 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Turning directly to terrorism the Crown Prince put 
Bahrain squarely on the front-line in a global war of ideas. 
He called for an effort to hit terrorists at their \"center of 
gravity,\" the Arab-Israeli conflict.  He added that this 
continues to be a strong marketing tool, allowing the 
terrorists to attract new recruits.  He said that without a 
resolution, efforts to root out extremism would continue to 
fail.  The Crown Prince said reformers in the region must be 
able to demonstrate that the justice and democracy America 
calls for is not antithetical to an Arab definition of those 
same principles, but rather part of one set of common and 
universal principles. 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
6.  (C) On Iraq, the Crown Prince noted the King\'s comment to 
Secretary Rumsfeld (Reftel) that the ultimate responsibility 
 
SIPDIS 
for the security of Iraq rests with the Iraqis, not the U.S. 
He said that now was the time to remain focused and that 
Bahrain was willing to due its part to support U.S. efforts 
in Iraq.

1.  (S) Ambassador October 16 delivered reftel demarche 
concerning Iranian activity in Iraq to Foreign Minister 
Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, emphasizing 
increasing United States concern about Iranian behavior in 
Iraq.  The Minister responded that the GOB shares our 
concerns and he has spoken publicly about this issue.  He 
noted that Bahrain took part in a conference with Iraq\'s 
neighbors, including Turkey and Iran, and the most important 
outcome of the conference was non-interference in Iraq\'s 
affairs and helping Iraqis establish a government and 
constitution. 
 
2.  (S) The FM said that he had spoken with the Iranians 
about Iraq during his mid-August visit to Tehran.  His 
interlocutors told him that Iran is unable to control 
completely its long border with Iraq, and the people crossing 
the border do not represent the GOI.  The FM reported that he 
had responded that the Iraqis should be left to settle their 
differences by themselves. 
 
3.  (S) Regarding Bahrain\'s bilateral relations with Iran, he 
said that the GOB keeps the dialogue going but is very 
careful in dealing with Tehran.  The next major visit will be 
Prime Minister Khalifa\'s planned trip to Iran in 2005. 
Bahrain continually delivers the message that Iran should not 
interfere in Bahrain\'s domestic affairs, and it can deliver 
the same message about Iraq. 
 
4.  (S) Comment:  Given the history of Iranian meddling in 
Bahrain, the GOB undoubtedly agrees with our position of 
non-interference in Iraqi domestic affairs.  However, the 
Bahrainis also understand that they have limited ability to 
influence Tehran\'s actions.

Saif and his staff, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, 
Governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) and his staff, 
Khalid Mohamed Kanoo, Chairman of the Bahrain Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (BCCI), Afnan Rashid Al Zayani of the 
Bahrain Business Women\'s Society, and members of the faculty 
at the BIBF, who also conducted a tour of the BIBF 
facilities.  At each meeting Dr. Smilor presented a draft 
plan for the activities of the center in its inaugural year 
and biographic data for two potential U.S. directors.  In a 
separate meeting with Yousif Humood, Ministry of Finance and 
National Economy (MOFNE) Director of Economic Planning, 
Smilor agreed to return to Bahrain in early January 2005 and 
to provide MOFNE with a precise description of the kind of 
facilities the center would need.

Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The Embassy is now working with the GOB on ways 
Bahrainis can benefit from the FTA. Staff at MOFNE are 
particularly concerned that the sector analysis now being 
conducted by Booz Allen be completed before they present the 
FTA to the Parliament (Arabic translation of the FTA is still 
underway).  We understand representatives from Booz Allen 
intend to travel to Bahrain during the last week of October. 
The Embassy supports this trip and will work with MOFNE staff 
to ensure its success. 
 
7.  (SBU) The Beyster visit, and particularly the meeting 
with Saif, proved crucial to turning the idea of an 
entrepreneurship center into a reality.  We now have a clear 
understanding of the Bahraini vision for the center and MOFNE 
appears eager to move forward.  Throughout the trip Beyster 
received the same message:  Bahrain needs this kind of center 
and its presence in Bahrain will help cement the country\'s 
reputation for exporting know-how in the Gulf.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Human rights activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja October 
16 pleaded not guilty to charges of inciting hatred against 
the regime and circulating false information about top 
officials.  During the opening session of his trial October 
20, Al Khawaja repeated his plea and asserted that at the 
September 24 symposium he had simply presented information 
demonstrating the prevalence of poverty in Bahrain and had 
held the government responsible for the situation.  Outside 
the courtroom, a small group of demonstrators pushed up 
against police lines, prompting the police to lob a tear gas 
canister into the crowd.  They disbursed rapidly and 
peacefully.  Despite the government extending an apparent 
olive branch to Nabil Rajab, one of Al Khawaja\'s chief 
supporters, Rajab refused to consider a compromise, 
apparently believing that public opinion is on his side and 
will force the government to seek a way out.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Plea of Not Guilty 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) At an initial hearing in court October 16, human 
rights activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja pleaded not guilty to 
charges of inciting hatred against the regime and circulating 
false information about top officials.  The hearing was 
delayed for about 90 minutes as some 200 supporters crowded 
the courthouse compound and courtroom and chanted slogans in 
support of Al Khawaja and against Prime Minister Khalifa. 
Police escorted Al Khawaja in front of the judge long enough 
for him to enter his plea and then quickly departed the area. 
 The judge refused a defense request to release the prisoner 
on his own recognizance, and scheduled the trial to begin on 
October 20.  Despite some jostling, there were no 
confrontations.  Following the 10-minute session, Al 
Khawaja\'s wife pleaded for his release. 
 
3.  (C) According to Nabil Rajab, president of the now-closed 
Bahrain Center for Human Rights, some altercations broke out 
between police and the approximately 50-200 supporters 
present at the court compound for the October 20 session, 
leading the police to launch one canister of tear gas into 
the crowd.  Rajab told Pol/Econ chief that security was very 
tight at the courthouse and only 20 supporters of Al Khawaja 
were permitted to enter the courtroom, including Rajab and 
Shaikh Ali Salman, who is president of the Shia opposition Al 
Wifaq political society. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Al Khawaja Asserts GOB Responsible for Poverty 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (C) Rajab reports that at the hearing, the judge again 
asked Al Khawaja to enter his plea, which he did.  The judge 
asked Al Khawaja about the character of his remarks at the 
September 24 symposium on poverty, the event that led to his 
arrest.  Al Khawaja replied that he had presented figures on 
income and unemployment and asserted that the GOB was 
responsible for the dismal economic prospects for the poor of 
the country.  Al Khawaja\'s lawyers argued that the charges 
were unconstitutional because the 2002 constitution protects 
freedom of speech.  The judge then called for a recess to 
consider the opening statements.  After about 45 minutes, and 
following the outbreak of altercations between the police and 
demonstrators outside the courthouse, the judge postponed the 
trial until Monday, October 25. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Pushing, Shoving, then Departure 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Rajab told us that clashes broke out following the 
arrest of a protester outside the courthouse.  One 
particularly vocal demonstrator demanded to enter the 
courtroom.  The police told him he could enter but then 
arrested him and took him away.  Word of the arrest spread 
among the demonstrators and they began pushing against police 
lines.  The police lobbed a tear gas canister into the crowd, 
causing the crowd to disburse.  Rajab said that the gas 
seeped into the courtroom and spectators moved outside.  Ali 
Salman spoke to the demonstrators and told them that it was 
important for them and for Bahrain to express their views 
peacefully, and he urged them to go home, which they did. 
There were no injuries.  An Embassy security mobile patrol 
arrived on the scene minutes after the confrontation, and 
there was no sign of the crowd. 
 
6.  (C) When asked whether there might be some room for 
compromise between the government and Al Khawaja, Rajab said 
that Minister of State (and PM confidant) Abdul Nabi Al 
Shoala had invited Rajab to his home recently to discuss a 
deal.  He proposed that Rajab state publicly that Al Khawaja 
had made a mistake, and that Rajab call on the Prime Minister 
at his office.  Rajab refused, stating his concern that the 
PM or his staff would tell the media that Rajab had 
apologized, something he would not do.  Despite discussion 
about several possible options for compromise with the 
government, Rajab remained adamant that the government had to 
take the first step to defuse the situation. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Al Khawaja and Rajab remain stubbornly steadfast in 
their position, apparently believing public opinion is on 
their side and will play a role in getting the government to 
seek a way out.  But the GOB\'s ongoing prosecution of Al 
Khawaja\'s case seems to indicate that the PM does not intend 
to back down.  Although there appears to be ample room for 
common ground and compromise, both sides continue to paint 
themselves into corners, increasing the possibility that Al 
Khawaja will be convicted and remain in jail.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH CROWN PRINCE 
 
REF: A. MANAMA 1489 B. MANAMA 1558 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
1. (S/NOFORN) Summary. The Crown Prince told the Ambassador 
October 23 that he would make calls to key Congressional 
leaders to urge early ratification of the FTA.  He defended 
his recent labor reform proposals, which were recently 
criticized by elements in the business community.  He denied 
that he had been given a role in the constitutional dialogue, 
stressing that his focus would be on the economy and 
education. He criticized the British Ambassador for meeting 
with opposition leaders who are operating outside of the 
constitution and the political system.  He acknowledged that 
the government\'s stiff reaction to human rights activist 
Al-Khawaja\'s speech attacking the Prime Minister had 
increased Al-Khawaja\'s popularity, but said this was not all 
bad as \"Al-Khawaja is very secular.\"  He added that action 
against Al-Khawaja (Shia) might make it easier to move 
against the four terrorist suspects (Sunni), as \"balance is 
very important in Bahrain.\"  He expected the four to receive 
a prison sentence when they go to trial starting November 1. 
End summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador, meeting with Crown Prince Salman Bin 
Hamed Al-Khalifa the evening of October 24, began the 
discussion by reviewing the state of play on ratification of 
the Free Trade Agreement.  It was unclear, the Ambassador 
said, whether the Congress would be able to get to the FTA 
during the lame duck session expected to begin in 
mid-November, but USTR reports that it would like to push it 
through as soon as possible, perhaps at least beginning the 
effort in November and certainly moving early in 2005.  The 
Crown Prince said that he would contact key members of 
Congress to help underscore the importance of the agreement 
for Bahrain. 
 
3. (C) The Crown Prince asked the Ambassador how the Embassy 
viewed his labor reform proposals, based on a McKinsey and 
Company report that recommended incentives to hire Bahraini 
workers rather than expatriates (ref a).  The Ambassador 
applauded the effort to address Bahrain\'s structural 
employment problems, but wondered how a plan that in effect 
raised labor costs would impact on Bahrain\'s export 
competitiveness.  The Crown Prince said that the plan called 
for increasing productivity to compensate for higher wages. 
Funds raised from higher fees on expatriate labor would be 
poured into training programs for Bahraini workers.  The 
Ambassador noted press reports that Bahraini business leaders 
criticized the plan during a discussion at a prominent 
business leader\'s Ramadan majlis.  The Crown Prince 
acknowledged the criticism, but said not all business leaders 
in Bahrain shared that view.  He said that a business group 
would issue a statement that evening supporting the plan. 
(Note:  The first deputy president of the Bahrain Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry did issue a statement saying that the 
views expressed at the Ramadan majlis on the negative impact 
of the labor reform proposals did not reflect the views of 
the private sector in the chamber.)  The Crown Prince also 
noted that Bahrain\'s economic development would not hinge on 
labor intensive industries, but increasingly on the service 
sector, where higher wages would have less of an impact. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador asked if the fact that human rights 
activist Al-Khawaja had used the McKinsey Report\'s critiques 
of the Bahrain economy to launch his personal attack on the 
Prime Minister (for which he was subsequently arrested) would 
affect his efforts to push forward the McKinsey proposals. 
The Crown Prince said it would not.  He said that Al-Khawaja 
case was now in the courts, being handled through legal 
channels.  The Ambassador noted that, in vigorously pursuing 
the case, the government had in fact increased Al-Khawaja\'s 
notoriety and popularity among at least a part of the 
population.  The Crown Prince acknowledged that this was 
true, but said that was not entirely a bad development. 
Al-Khawaja is very secular, he observed. 
 
5. (C/NOFORN) The Ambassador asked about the status of the 
constitutional dialogue between the government and four 
opposition Shia parties who boycotted the last parliamentary 
elections.  Noting that the government broke off the dialogue 
last week after British Ambassador Lamb had met with leaders 
of the opposition parties, the Ambassador sought the Crown 
Prince\'s views on where this was headed.  The Crown Prince 
was highly critical of Ambassador Lamb, saying an ambassador 
should not have contacts with the leadership of groups that 
are operating outside the constitution and the political 
system.  It would be like an Ambassador in London meeting 
with Gerry Adams at the height of his anti-government 
activity in Northern Ireland, he said.  It is all right for 
lower-level officials to meet them, but not the ambassador. 
 
6. (C) On prospects for re-starting the constitutional 
dialogue, which is led on the government side by the Minister 
of Labor and Social Welfare, the Crown Prince was dismissive 
of its importance, saying that the boycotting opposition 
parties will have to work through the parliament if they want 
to push for reforms.   Asked if he was going to get 
personally involved in the constitutional dialogue, as the 
King implied in his October 9 speech opening the third 
session of the parliament (ref b), the Crown Prince 
categorically denied that the King had this in mind or that 
he would get involved.  \"I am sticking to development issues 
such as the economy and education,\" he stated.  \"I won\'t 
touch the constitutional dialogue issue with a ten-foot pole.\" 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador observed that the local political scene 
seemed somewhat charged these days, citing as examples 
Bahrain Human Rights Center (BHRC) former executive director 
Al-Khawaja\'s public criticism of the Prime Minister, his 
subsequent arrest (and closing of the BHRC), continuing 
demonstrations in support of Al-Khawaja, and the breakdown of 
the constitutional dialogue talks.  The Crown Prince said he 
expected this to be the norm now that the King had initiated 
the democratic reform process.  The government and the people 
will continue to feel their way, exploring the limits. 
 
8. (S) The Ambassador asked for an update on the four 
terrorist suspects, who face a court date on November 1.  The 
Crown Prince said that they would go to trial on November 1 
and that he expected they would receive a prison term of no 
more than three years (based on the limited evidence), 
although in the end it would depend on the decision of the 
judge.  (Note: Three years is the maximum sentence allowable 
under the current conspiracy law.)  He expected Yasir Kemal 
to get additional time as a result of his escape from the 
court room after the hearing in September.  The Ambassador 
reiterated that it was critically important that the four 
receive a prison sentence to send the right message on 
terrorism.  The Crown Prince said that the action against 
Al-Khawaja (a Shia) might actually make it easier to move 
against the four terrorist suspects (Sunnis).  \"Balance,\" he 
said, \"is very important in Bahrain.\" 
 
9. (C) Finally, the Crown Prince asked about Iraq. The 
Ambassador described recent positive developments, including 
the recontrol of Samara, the apparent decision of al-Sadr to 
participate in the political process, and the impending start 
of the election registration process.  The Crown Prince 
stressed that it was critically important that we stay the 
course in Iraq and not withdraw prematurely before Iraqi 
security forces are capable of maintaining order.

------------------------ 
Summary and Introduction 
------------------------ 
 
1.  (SBU) The Council of Representatives (COR - lower house 
of parliament) October 9 opened for its third parliamentary 
session since the adoption of the 2002 constitution.  In the 
absence of political parties, which are still illegal, the 
forty members have formed six blocs based upon common 
interests or common religious views.  These are Al Minbar; Al 
Asala; Al Islamiya; National Democrats; Independents; and the 
newly established Economic Elite.  The blocs are not 
completely rigid and leaders allow the members to offer or 
gain support from other blocs on particular issues.  The 
blocs will occasionally form alliances with one another, but 
none are permanent.  They are pursuing legislation to further 
their political objectives but have made the most headlines 
through their actions on religious and moral issues.  In 
fact, due to ongoing disputes between the parliament, 
government, and opposition political societies outside the 
system regarding constitutional processes for drafting, 
submitting, and passing legislation, very few bills have been 
enacted during the previous two legislative sessions.  Though 
Bahrain\'s Shia community represents some two-thirds of the 
citizenry, they are underrepresented in the COR because of 
the decision by Al Wifaq, the most popular Shia political 
society, to boycott the 2002 parliamentary elections.  End 
Summary and Introduction. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Al Minbar:  Relatively Moderate Sunni Islamists 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (SBU) Al Minbar is Bahrain\'s Muslim Brotherhood and in 
the Bahraini context the group has developed into a 
relatively moderate, constructive Sunni organization.  It and 
Al Asala, the Sunni Salafi (more conservative) political bloc 
in parliament, often cooperate, particularly on issues 
involving religious affairs and morals.  Al Minbar, with 
seven members, and Al Asala, with five members, comprise 12 
of the 40 deputies in the COR, or 30 percent, and they have 
emerged as the most potent political force in parliament.  Al 
Minbar\'s primary legislative focus has been on a personal 
status law that is in line with Islamic Sharia but is 
acceptable to all Bahraini citizens, Sunni and Shia alike. 
Al Minbar\'s chairman, physician Salah Ali, is a prominent 
advocate for the rights of women and children.  Al Minbar has 
drafted a bill on child education and proposed the 
establishment of family counseling centers.  Because of the 
size and internal discipline of the Al Minbar voting bloc, it 
often plays the role of deal maker/breaker in COR decisions. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Chairman Ali\'s moderate image is in marked 
contrast with Spokesman Shaikh Mohammed Khalid Ibraheem\'s 
persona.  Ibraheem publicly expresses strongly anti-American 
views and has refused to meet with American officials.  He 
has ties with and vocally supports the six Sunni terror 
suspects and has organized campaigns calling for the release 
of the Bahraini detainees at Guantanamo.  He headed protests 
against satellite television channel MBC\'s filming the show 
\"Big Brother\" in Bahrain in February, which led to the 
Minister of Information\'s decision to close down the 
production. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Al Asala:  Salafis in the Modern Age 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) The five members of the COR in the Al Asala bloc 
are from the Sunni Salafi offshoot of Islam and adhere to a 
strict literal interpretation of Koranic and Hadith 
scriptures.  Al Asala political bloc is an affiliate of Al 
Tarbiya Al Islamiya (Islamic Education) Charity Society, from 
which it receives funding.  In general, Al Asala does not 
take a confrontational stance towards the GOB.  Al Asala 
President Shaikh Adel Al Moawda told PolFSN that his bloc has 
three main goals:  to increase the standard of living; 
support institutions that will improve political, social and 
economic stability; and enhance financial and administrative 
oversight.  Al Asala has proposed draft legislation to 
establish unemployment insurance, criminalize trafficking in 
persons, and penalize the press for violating individuals\' 
privacy. 
 
5.  (SBU) Al Asala\'s president Al Moawda is poised, western 
educated, speaks excellent English and is willing to discuss 
any issue with EmbOffs.  He spoke out publicly against 
Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram holding a concert in Bahrain in 
late 2003, but told us he was chagrined that his 
outspokenness led to protests and eventually the cancellation 
of the concert.  Although Al Asala takes a conservative 
Islamic stance, Al Moawda has publicly denounced the Taliban 
and Al Qaida, and is in favor of allowing women to drive 
while wearing the veil, a recent development in Bahrain.  An 
emerging member of the bloc whose shyness has kept him out of 
the public eye is attorney Hamad Al Mohannadi, a legal 
technocrat who is focused on amending the COR\'s bylaws. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Al Islamiya:  Shia, but Not Representative 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU)  An affiliate of the Shia Al Rabita Society, Al 
Islamiya is the sole Shia-only bloc in the COR.  Its seven 
members\' main goals are to uphold the teaching of Islamic 
Sharia and to ensure that legislation does not conflict with 
cultural mores and Sharia principles.  The bloc is 
comparatively large in size but diminutive in power, and Al 
Islamiya has been dubbed the \"sleeping bloc.\"  Though 
two-thirds of the citizens of Bahrain are Shia, they are 
underrepresented in parliament because of the boycott of the 
2002 elections led by the largest Shia political society, Al 
Wifaq.  Al Islamiya drafted bills to mandate teaching the 
principles of the major sects of Islam in schools and to 
establish a drug rehabilitation center.  It has been a 
proponent of combating unemployment, offering housing for the 
poor, providing care for the elderly, and empowerment of 
women and children. 
 
7.  (SBU) Chairman Ali Al Samaheji laments that his bloc has 
little public support.  He opposes Al Wifaq\'s participation 
in the 2006 parliamentary elections, understanding 
(correctly) that neither he nor his colleagues in Al Islamiya 
have much chance of winning races against Al Wifaq candidates. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Pro-Government Independents 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Despite its name, the eight-member Independent bloc 
is a pro-government Sunni grouping.  Chairman Abdul Aziz Al 
Mousa and Spokesman Abdulla Al Dosari told us that the bloc\'s 
main goals are to uphold the teachings of the National Action 
Charter (King Hamad\'s social contract for democratic reform), 
develop public infrastructure, and expand subsidies for 
housing, water, electricity and health care.  The Independent 
bloc uniformly supports GOB positions.  Its two major draft 
bills concern instituting an airport tax exemption for 
Bahrainis and the controversial political societies law, 
which seeks to regulate the registration and activities of 
political societies (in the absence of legal political 
parties).  Other parliamentary blocs and various sectors of 
society have condemned the draft for its restrictions and 
harsh punishments for violations. 
 
---------------- 
Truly Democratic 
---------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) The National Democratic bloc has three members who 
always reach a unanimous consensus before moving forward on 
any initiative.  For the past two years it has been the only 
bloc with both Sunni and Shia members, until the recent 
formation of the Economic Elite bloc.  The National 
Democratic bloc is the most liberal, active and outspoken 
parliamentary group.  The members advocate transparency, 
accountability, and continued political and economic reform. 
It has proposed a number of draft bills to facilitate foreign 
direct investment.  It is currently working to establish 
consumer protection regulations and to form a High Council 
for Planning. 
 
--------------------- 
New Guys on the Block 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Parliament\'s newest group is the Economic Elite 
bloc.  Like the Democratic bloc, its members are both Sunni 
and Shia.  Bloc member attorney Fareed Ghazi told EmbOffs 
that the members formed the bloc to ensure the country\'s 
economic interests are taken into account, especially 
following a number of COR proposals and actions such as the 
Nancy Ajram and \"Big Brother\" incidents that angered the 
business community and threatened Bahrain\'s traditional 
atmosphere and reputation for openness and tolerance. 
Chairman Jassim Hassan Abdul A\'al said that the bloc will 
work to protect Bahrain\'s investment climate, with a focus on 
making foreign investors comfortable in the country, and 
counteract the Islamist tendencies of many COR members. 
Member Issa Abu Al Fateh told EmbOffs that he would consider 
an alliance only with the National Democratic bloc, though he 
would support other blocs\' proposals when appropriate. 
 
------------------------ 
The Unassociated Members 
------------------------ 
 
11.  (SBU) The six unassociated members are truly independent 
and do not have ties with each other or with any of the 
blocs.  COR Chairman Khalifa Al Dhahrani is an unassociated 
member.

1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief met with MFA Director for 
International Organizations Ghassan Shaikho October 12 to 
discuss the Costa Rica resolution on human cloning and 
Bahrain\'s bid for the UNGA presidency for the 2006-07 
session.  Shaikho said that the GOB opposes human cloning, 
but had requested an opinion (fatwa) from Bahrain\'s religious 
scholars on the narrow issue of human cloning for the sake of 
medical research.  The scholars had not yet delivered their 
position.  Shaikho noted that representatives of the 
Organization of Islamic Conferences member states were 
consulting in New York on the Costa Rica resolution to 
develop a common position.  He was surprised to learn that 
the European Parliament had voted strongly in favor of a 
resolution supporting the Costa Rica resolution (reftels), 
but commented that the European Parliament did not 
necessarily represent the views of the EU countries.  He 
understood that many EU governments supported Germany\'s 
proposal on human cloning. 
 
2.  (SBU) Shaikho stated that Bahrain had announced its 
candidacy for the UNGA presidency for the 61st session, from 
September 2006-2007.  Bahrain had received many expressions 
of support and, following Cambodia\'s withdrawal of its 
nomination, was the only candidate for the position.  He 
noted that the UNGA presidency for the 61st session would go 
to an Asian country.  Shaikho requested the support of the 
United States for Bahrain\'s candidacy, suggesting that there 
would be many new avenues for bilateral cooperation with 
Bahrain in the position. 
 
3.  (SBU) Shaikho said that Bahrain was interested in hosting 
a regional office/training center for the UN Commission on 
Human Rights.  Bahrain had submitted a proposal to the UNGA 
and UNCHR, and it may soon go to the Fifth Committee for 
consideration, and he requested U.S. support.  The regional 
office would likely cost $1 million for the first year and 
less for following years.  He recognized that the U.S. is 
wary of the UN taking on additional financial burdens, but 
stressed that the office would play an important role and 
would help achieve U.S. policy objectives in the region.

Classified by DCM Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
-------------------------------- 
Draft CT Law To Go To Parliament 
-------------------------------- 
 
1.  (S) Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed bin Ibrahim Al 
Mutawwa gave Ambassador a copy (in Arabic) of the draft 
counter-terrorism (CT) law and a clarifying memorandum 
explaining the draft (reftel).  Mutawwa stated that the 
Cabinet had approved the draft and would soon forward the law 
to parliament for consideration.  He said that the GOB had 
still not decided whether to present the CT law as a 
stand-alone bill or as an amendment to the existing penal 
code.  The draft as given to us is written as an amendment to 
the penal code, but the substance of the law would remain the 
same regardless of the vehicle chosen for adoption. 
 
2.  (S) What follows is post\'s analysis of the clarifying 
memo of the draft law, based upon an informal Embassy 
translation.  Due to its length and complexity, we have not 
reviewed the law itself in any detail.  We anticipate 
Department will undertake formal translation of the draft law 
and the clarifying memo. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Cover Conspiracy, Toughen Penalties 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) The draft law would broaden the definition of 
conspiracy and strengthen the penalties for conspiracy to 
commit terrorist acts.  Though the clarifying memo (full text 
of informal Embassy translation in paragraph 8) does not 
spell out the maximum sentence for conspiracy to commit 
terrorist acts, the draft law (pouched to NEA/ARPI, along 
with clarifying memo) designates the death penalty, among 
other options.  The conspiracy articles in the existing penal 
code were intended to address conspiracy to commit crimes and 
have a maximum penalty of three years in prison. 
 
4.  (S) According to the clarifying memo, the draft law is 
intended to confront the threat resulting from the emergence 
of international terrorism.  With respect to the existing 
penal law, the draft will:  (1) define terrorism; (2) 
criminalize some acts and impose strong punishments; (3) 
strengthen punishment for criminal acts already covered in 
Bahraini law; (4) limit the discretionary authority of 
judges; and (5) criminalize participation in a conspiracy to 
commit a terrorist act.  The draft also mandates 
modifications in the criminal procedures law. 
 
5.  (S) The draft law directly addresses our concerns about 
the existing penal code.  It specifically criminalizes 
conspiracy to commit terrorist acts and establishes stringent 
punishments.  The preamble of the clarifying memorandum 
speaks about terrorism in a way that distinguishes it from 
more ordinary criminal acts, as a threat to the security of 
an entire society. 
 
----------------------------- 
Broad Definition of Terrorism 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (S) The definition of terrorism, as written in the 
clarifying memo, seems to be quite broad.  It reads, 
terrorism is \"every method used by a perpetrator, singly or 
in a group, to accomplish an act whose purpose is to obstruct 
laws and regulations, disturb peace, cause harm to state and 
the security of the Kingdom, or affecting the national unity 
or world security, by means of force of violence or 
instilling terror, or threatening individuals or threatening 
their public safety, or causing damage to the environment or 
public health or the national economy or public institutions 
or causing damage to public or private property.\"  The 
clarifying memo continues that this definition of terrorism 
is consistent with the definition found in the French, 
Egyptian, Moroccan, and Jordanian penal laws, the Arab 
agreement to combat terrorism, the GCC agreement to combat 
terrorism, and the agreement of the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference to combat international terrorism. 
 
--------------------- 
Detention of Suspects 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (S) Regarding the GOB\'s ability to hold suspects, the 
clarifying memo states that suspects can be detained for two 
days following arrest, and an additional seven days with the 
permission of the attorney general.  The AG then has three 
days to decide whether to seek court permission to continue 
to hold the suspect.  Thus the government can hold the 
suspect for up to 12 days without specific permission from 
the court.  Though not explicitly stated in the clarifying 
memo, we expect the court to have the right to authorize 
detention for up to six months, in renewable 45-day 
increments.  This then would bring the detention system for 
terrorism cases into line with the existing system for 
criminal cases.  Currently, for cases deemed threatening to 
the state, the system informally moves directly to the 45-day 
detention period.  The law would regularize the process and 
require the government to review its case at fixed intervals. 
 
----------------------- 
Text of Clarifying Memo 
----------------------- 
 
8.  (S) Begin text of Embassy informal translation of 
clarifying memorandum for the counter-terrorism draft law: 
 
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful 
Clarifying Memorandum 
Regarding proposed modifications of some of the judgments of 
the Penal Law that was issued by the decree of Law Number 
(15) of 1976 
and the Criminal Procedures Law that was issued by the decree 
of Law Number (46) of 2002 
 
Bahrain has remained - and God willing will remain - over the 
course of its long history a safe and stable place, and an 
example of national unity.  The picture of crime in Bahrain 
did not differ from crime in any other country, and the 
current Penal Law that was issued in 1976, and the various 
modifications to that law, was sufficient to confront crime. 
 
In recent years a new crime scenario has emerged in Bahrain 
that was not previously known to the Bahraini or 
international communities.  This crime scenario utilizes 
violence or threats or terror, and has dangerous goals, 
foremost among them is the destruction of public order, and 
it threatens the peace and security of citizens and society. 
As well, this new crime scenario has been perpetrated either 
by groups or individuals, and the attacks have changed from 
attacks against individual citizens to attacks against means 
of transportation, the environment, resistance to authority, 
or impeding the constitution or laws. 
 
And when these acts represent a threat to the security of 
society, it becomes necessary to confront these acts and 
prevent their destructive outcomes.  The Kingdom ratified a 
number of international and regional and Gulf agreements to 
combat terrorism and stop its means of support, recognizing 
the threats posed by terrorism in its many forms. 
 
But despite the ratification of the international agreements, 
and taking the measures required by the constitution, it 
places it in the level of laws that must be implemented. 
Penal legislation is society\'s tool to confront criminal 
behavior.  And for this reason, the government prepared the 
law proposed to the Shura Council and the Representatives to 
confront this new type of criminal current. 
 
Lawmakers in many of the countries that faced these acts 
modified their criminal procedural law and penal law, among 
them French law of 1994, Egyptian law of 1992, Moroccan law 
of 2003 and Jordanian law. 
 
And following this direction, the proposed law was prepared 
by modifying the penal law that was decreed by Law (15) of 
1976 and the Criminal Procedures Law decreed by Law (46) of 
2002 as submitted to the Councils to avoid duplicating 
legislation. 
 
First:  with respect to modifications of the penal law: 
 
1.  Specifying the definition of terrorism: 
The proposed law struggled to specify the definition of 
terrorism and to clarify what is meant by it.  It mentioned 
that it is every method used by a perpetrator, singly or in a 
group, to accomplish an act whose purpose is to obstruct laws 
and regulations, disturb peace, cause harm to state and the 
security of the Kingdom, or affecting the national unity or 
world security, by means of force of violence or instilling 
terror, or threatening individuals or threatening their 
public safety, or causing damage to the environment or public 
health or the national economy or public institutions or 
causing damage to public or private property. 
 
The above definition of terrorism is consistent with the 
definition found in the laws and agreements relating to this 
issue, such as the French penal law, and Egyptian penal law, 
and Moroccan penal law, and Jordanian law, and the Arab 
agreement to combat terrorism, and the GCC agreement to 
combat terrorism, and the agreement of the Organization of 
the Islamic Conference to combat international terrorism. 
2.  The criminalization of some acts and the imposition of 
stronger punishments: 
 
a.  The proposed law criminalizes the creation of formation 
or organization or management or leadership of any 
association or organization or group whose purpose is to call 
by any means for the obstruction of laws or public order or 
the prevention of any of the government\'s organizations or 
any public organization of conducting its business, or 
interference in the personal freedoms of citizens or the 
public\'s rights as provided by the constitution or law, if 
terrorism is among the means used to establish this purpose. 
 
The proposed law also punishes all who supplied weapons or 
ammunition or explosives or equipment or information, or 
arranged a place or homes or any type of safe haven, or hid 
any things or money or weapons that might be used in these 
acts, or who gathered or gave or designated or received or 
used any property or money for these purposes or gave them to 
someone affiliated with this purpose, or who assisted in any 
banking or financial or trade action or who gave terrorists 
any financial assistance. 
 
As well, the proposed law also punishes any one who is a 
member of these organizations or who assisted them in any 
way, and any one who publicizes - either verbally or in 
writing - the purposes and principles that terrorists call 
for, and any one who uses terrorism to force a person to join 
the organization or who prevents a person from leaving the 
organization. 
 
And the proposed law gave authority to the courts if the 
crime has been committed for terrorist purposes on behalf of 
an entity by its members or representatives, that the entity 
can be dissolved, or closed either permanently or 
temporarily, or deprived either permanently or temporarily 
from participating in public bids, or fined, and the 
confiscation of money and property and equipment, etc., that 
might have been used in the commission of the crime, or for 
the preparation of the crime. 
 
b.  The proposed law criminalizes the seeking of, or 
communication with, any organization or association which 
might be located outside the country for the purpose of 
conducting a terrorist act against the Kingdom of Bahrain or 
the interests of any foreign country inside the Kingdom, or 
against the properties or interests of the Kingdom outside 
Bahrain. 
 
And the proposed law criminalizes the joining of any 
association or group - whatever its name may be - that might 
be located outside the country, and whose purpose is 
terrorism or military training as a means of achieving its 
purposes, if its actions are not directed to the Kingdom of 
Bahrain. 
 
The proposed law also criminalizes weapons and explosives 
training for terrorism purposes. 
 
c.  The proposed law cited some important terrorist crime 
examples and placed deterrent punishments on them. 
 
Among the most significant of these crimes - the hijacking of 
air, ground, or maritime transportation means, and the 
exposing of these transportation means, or those who use 
them, to danger, and the kidnapping of their passengers, or 
the resistance to public authorities as they conduct their 
duties, etc. 
 
The introduction of a dangerous substance to the country or 
the placement of such a substance in the ground or in the 
water, or its spread by air, if the purpose behind this 
introduction is a terrorist act and the substance endangers 
the health and well-being of humans or animals or the 
environment. 
 
3.  Strengthening punishment on existing criminal acts in 
Bahrain law: 
 
The proposed law strengthened the punishments of some 
criminal acts already existing under the Bahrain penal law, 
as the practical reality has proven that the existing 
punishments for these acts do not deter/prevent their 
occurrence in light of the changes to which society has been 
exposed.  Among these acts are crimes associated with 
religions, and crimes outlined in the second clause, fourth 
section, if these crimes are associated with a terrorism 
purpose, and the crime of failing to inform the general 
authorities of the occurrence of a crime if this crime is 
associated with a terrorism purpose, and the crime of making 
a false report if this crime is associated with a terrorism 
purpose. 
The proposed law doubled the maximum fines required under 
subclauses 178, 179, 180, 182, and 184, to where the minimum 
fine is Bahraini Dinars 100, because the fines that are under 
the subclauses are too ineffective in preventing the crimes 
given the prevailing circumstances. 
As well, if any crime - for which there is no specific 
punishment under the penal law -  is committed for terrorism 
purposes, \"extenuating circumstances\" would apply when 
considering the punishment. 
 
4.  Limiting the discretionary authority of judges: 
 
Considering the severity of terrorism crimes, the proposed 
law has limited the judge\'s authority of using article 72 of 
the penal law.  Article 72 would not apply at the sentencing 
of terrorism crimes unless the punishment is death or life in 
prison.  In those instances, the punishment can be lessened 
by one factor; i.e., the judge can consider life in prison 
instead of death, or can sentence a person to 15 years 
instead of life in prison. 
 
5.  Participation in a crime: 
 
The proposed law has decided to sentence those associated 
with criminal agreement or conspiracy to commit a crime, if 
the crime is terrorist in nature, and even if the crime was 
not committed, given the danger of terrorism acts. 
 
Second:  With respect to modifications in the criminal 
procedures law: 
 
1.  Given the severity of terrorism crimes, rulings issued 
against these crimes will not be rescinded (i.e., if an 
individual is wanted/convicted of a terrorism-related crime, 
the person will remain wanted for the crime until sentence is 
served.) 
 
2.  And if the terrorism crime involved more than one person, 
or a group, it will require more time of the investigating 
authorities for investigations and collection of evidence, 
and arresting suspects, and searches.  If sufficient evidence 
is available to arrest an individual for such a crime, or if 
one is caught in the act, the proposed law grants the 
arresting authority power to arrest the individual.  Within 
48 hours at the most, the arresting officer can then ask the 
attorney general for an extension not to exceed seven days. 
And the arresting/investigating officer must take a statement 
from the accused.  If there is no evidence to suggest the 
individual\'s innocence before the end of the seven days, the 
arresting/investigating officer then sends the accused to 
attorney general.  It is up to the attorney general to 
question the accused within three days and then order his 
arrest or his release. 
 
3.  And if the investigation in these crimes may be lengthy 
given their complication and involvement, and it might exceed 
the initial period of arrest of the attorney general, the 
proposed law then authorizes seeking the lower court 
authority.  The proposed law allows the attorney general to 
investigate and push the case forward and not to be limited 
by the constraints of this law. 
 
4.  As terrorist organizations rely in their activities on 
sending messages and money that may come from outside the 
country, and the public authorities may not determine the 
truth at the appropriate time, and the monitoring of accounts 
and deposits of the accused or those who might be or become 
under suspicion, the proposed law authorizes the attorney 
general to order the confiscation of the messages (in various 
forms), and the monitoring of communication in various forms, 
and the recording of activities in public and private venues, 
if there is value to uncovering the truth, and for a period 
not to exceed 90 days.  This period can not be extended 
except by order of the specialized court.  The attorney 
general is also authorized to check or acquire any 
information that might be associated with these accounts if 
this will lead to uncovering the truth of the crimes. 
 
5.  To protect the investigators, and to prevent terrorists 
from learning the source of the information, and to prevent 
useful information from becoming known to the public and 
especially the terrorists before the investigation is 
complete, the proposed law provides that the information 
presented by the security forces to extend the period of the 
arrest remain secret with the attorney general, and not be 
presented publicly.

SUBJECT: TERRORISM SUSPECTS RELEASED PENDING DECEMBER 6 
COURT DATE 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Minister of Justice Al Arrayid confirmed to the 
Ambassador that charges had been filed against the four 
terrorism suspects at a court hearing on November 1, and that 
they had been released pending their next court date on 
December 6.  He said that the government did not have the 
legal authority to extend the detention of the suspects once 
again until the next session.  He promised a fuller 
explanation to the Ambassador in a meeting planned for 
November 2. 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador called Minister of Industry (and confidant 
to the King) Fakhro to express his concern regarding the 
release of the four.  Fakhro, after talking to the King, 
called the Ambassador back to say that the King had told him 
the four would be sentenced on December 6.  (Comment:  We 
understand that the December 6 session will in fact be the 
beginning of the actual trial.  End Comment.)  In the 
meantime, their passports are being held by the public 
prosecutor, they will be kept under surveillance, and they 
will not be allowed to leave the country.  \"Rest assured,\" he 
said, \"everything will be done from our side to ensure that 
they are dealt with appropriately.\" 
 
3.  (C) Attorney and MP Farid Ghazi Rifaie, who represents 
one of the accused, told PolFSN that the November 1 session 
was quick.  The judge received the results of an 
investigation of physical evidence, which concluded there was 
no trace of explosives in fertilizer and sand seized by the 
police.  The prosecutor requested that the detainees remain 
in custody, and defense lawyers requested they be released. 
The judge decided to release them and, according to a press 
contact in the court room, the suspects had to provide their 
residences as bonds.  They also agreed to be available to the 
government at their residences and not to leave the country. 
(Note:  Rifaie said the suspects simply had to provide 
information on their places of residence rather than offer 
them as bonds.  End Note.)  Rifaie said that the four had 
been charged under Article 156 of the penal code, criminal 
agreement to commit a crime.  This is the best the 
prosecution can do in the absence of a terrorism conspiracy 
law. 
 
4.  (C) Comment:  While the judge\'s action today is a 
disappointment, we will continue to push the GOB hard on the 
need for a conviction and sentencing, both to get these four 
off the streets and to send a strong message on Bahrain\'s 
willingness to combat terrorism.

1.  (C) The Committee to support Shia activist Abdul Hadi Al 
Khawaja has decided to stop its protest activities following 
a weekend of demonstrations, violence and arrests.  A \"car 
parade\" in support of Al Khawaja tied up traffic in Manama 
for hours October 28 during peak evening hours for visiting 
during this month of Ramadan.  Police arrested 25 
participants, seized their licenses and suspended their 
driving privileges.  On October 29, masked young men lured 
police to an empty lot and attacked their vehicles with 
Molotov cocktails.  Police intend to respond forcefully to 
additional provocations.  President of the closed Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights Nabeel Rajab (protect throughout) 
told us he is searching for a face-saving way to stop the 
escalations and cycle of violence.  The Cabinet approved a 
draft law imposing new regulations on those wishing to hold 
demonstrations.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Committee Calls Off Demonstrations 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Nabeel Rajab, president of the closed Bahrain Center 
for Human Rights told PolOff October 31 that the 20-member 
Committee to Support (Shia activist Abdul Hadi) Al Khawaja 
had decided to suspend protest activities until the end of 
Ramadan (about November 14).  The Committee issued a press 
statement later the same day saying the organization would 
suspend its activities due to the deteriorating security 
situation and acts of violence that had created chaos in many 
areas in the last few days.  Specifically, it canceled the 
protest scheduled for Wednesday, the day of Al Khawaja\'s next 
court session.  Rajab told us that the Committee would 
proceed with a previously scheduled symposium the evening of 
November 1 during which it would solicit suggestions on 
\"peaceful and positive ways\" to support Al Khawaja. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Car Parade Snarls Traffic Throughout Capital 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The move to halt protest activities follows a weekend 
of demonstrations, arrests, and property damage.  On 
Thursday, October 28, the Committee organized a \"car parade\" 
to call for Al Khawaja\'s release.  The organizers envisioned 
supporters slowly driving their vehicles in the rightmost 
lane in a loop on six-lane major arteries, as they had done 
about one month ago with little traffic disruption and no 
confrontation with security forces.  This time, the parade 
caused massive problems.  By about 8:00 PM, riot police lined 
the major highways in anticipation of the parade to begin at 
about 9:00 PM, the peak traveling/visiting time on this 
weekend evening during the month of Ramadan.  According to 
participants in the parade, police blocked off all lanes to 
stop the processions.  Ministry of Interior (MOI) sources 
dispute this, telling RSO that protesters intentionally 
parked their vehicles at major intersections.  Whatever the 
cause, the traffic snarls delayed travelers up to two hours 
throughout Manama. 
 
4.  (C) At about 9:30 PM, RSO observed from the Embassy as 
approximately 150 demonstrators gathered at the McDonald\'s 
intersection adjacent to the Embassy compound.  Some 200 
police watched and formed ranks to confront the protesters 
only when they noticed some of the participants carrying 
stones.  The protesters then fled the area.  At midnight, RSO 
observed some 35 young people detained and wearing flex-cuffs 
on the median strip of the highway about one mile from the 
Embassy.  (Note:  The Embassy was not targeted in any way; 
the McDonald\'s intersection is a popular location for 
demonstrations because protesters can disrupt traffic easily 
throughout the area by disturbing the flow of vehicles on 
these major roads.  End Note.)  There are unconfirmed reports 
of police using tear gas to disperse protesters who had laid 
down in the highway close to the entrance of the causeway to 
Saudi Arabia. 
 
---------- 
25 Arrests 
---------- 
5.  (C) The press reported October 29 that police had 
arrested 25 people, confiscated their licenses, and suspended 
their driving privileges for 30 days.  Among those arrested 
are two human rights activists:  spokesperson of the National 
Committee for Victims of Torture Abdul Raouf Al Shayeb and 
board member Mahmood Ramadan.  According to MOI sources, both 
Al Shayeb and Ramadan were arrested because they had 
organized the event, not for provoking police or disrupting 
traffic.  Initial charges brought against demonstrators 
include illegal assembly, obstructing police from carrying 
out their duty, violent acts, and violence against public 
sector employees.  Charges could bring 5-7 years in jail and 
fines up to BD500 ($1,325) per person. 
 
--------------------------- 
Evening (Molotov) Cocktails 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The following day, prominent Shia cleric Shaikh Isa 
Qassim and opposition society Al Wifaq President Shaikh Ali 
Salman emphasized in their Friday sermons the importance of 
preserving freedoms and expressing support for Al Khawaja in 
a peaceful manner.  However, that same evening, on October 
29, a group of ten young men wearing hoods set fire to trash 
bins in an empty lot next to the Bahrain Mall in Sanabis. 
When police arrived at the scene, the men threw Molotov 
cocktails at the police cars, setting fire to and damaging 
one of them.  MOI contacts told RSO that they arrested some 
of the attackers and are conducting investigations of others. 
 Police are confident of making additional arrests.  The MOI 
characterized those arrested as being supporters of Al 
Khawaja.  These officials expressed their anger at the 
intentional manner in which the attackers lured police to the 
scene by damaging property and then tossed the Molotov 
cocktails.  The police warned that they would deal harshly 
with additional provocations.  Other protesters stoned a 
police vehicle the night of October 30 and burned tires the 
night of October 31. 
 
7.  (C)  Rajab told us he had met with MOI Under Secretary 
Shaikh Daij bin Khalifa Al Khalifa October 30 to discuss ways 
to calm the situation.  Rajab reported that he had condemned 
the violence and informed Shaikh Daij of the Committee\'s 
decision to suspend activities for the remainder of Ramadan. 
Rajab asserted that the Committee organized peaceful 
demonstrations only and feared it may not be able to control 
the more radical elements among Al Khawaja\'s supporters, such 
as those who had carried out the Molotov cocktail attack.  He 
commented to us that he and the Committee were now looking 
for a face-saving way to stop the escalations and cycle of 
violence. 
 
------------------------------ 
Draft Law Coming to Parliament 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) The Cabinet announced October 31 that it had approved 
a draft law to regulate rallies and demonstrations.  It would 
require organizers of rallies and protests to obtain permits 
from the relevant governors\' offices, and stipulates prison 
sentences and fines for those convicted of violations.  The 
law must be debated in and approved by the Shura and Nowab 
Councils (upper and lower houses of parliament) before 
entering into force.  Leaders of several blocs in the Nowab 
have already spoken publicly in support of the draft law. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The Committee to Support Al Khawaja has taken itself 
out of the game for now, and people are left wondering who is 
responsible for the acts of violence against security forces. 
 Rajab, Isa Qassim and Ali Salman have consistently called 
for peaceful acts of protest in support of Al Khawaja.  An 
unnamed Al Wifaq source told Al Wasat newspaper October 31 
that a radical wing of Al Wifaq, outside the control of 
Salman, was responsible for the attacks and violence. 
Another possibility is that bored youth are taking advantage 
of the charged atmosphere to carry out acts of vandalism 
devoid of any political meaning or intent. 
 
10.  (C) Comment Continued:  One effect of the increasingly 
confrontational tactics of the opposition and strong security 
response has been to bolster the stature and power of the 
Prime Minister.  He has been at best a lukewarm supporter of 
King Hamad\'s political and economic reform program, and the 
friction between the government and the mainly Shia 
opposition has permitted him to flex his law-and-order 
persona and muscle.  He has been hailed as a hero during 
recent visits to Ramadan majleses in Sunni strongholds while 
the King and Crown Prince Salman have been much less in the 
public view.  Ironically, Al Khawaja\'s bid to push the 
envelope on freedom of speech and expression may ultimately 
lead to greater restrictions in these areas, such as the 
draft law that will further regulate demonstrations.

SUBJECT: The Bahrain Financial Center - If you build it, 
they will come. 
 
1. (U) Summary:  On October 17 the Ambassador visited the 
Bahrain Financial Harbor (BFH), a USD $1.3 billion 
project to develop a mini-city of luxury offices and 
apartments targeted at the financial services and 
insurance sectors.  The BFH is seen as a complement to 
GOB efforts to promote Bahrain as an international 
financial hub.  Investors and the GOB are banking on the 
Bahrain Monetary Agency\'s solid reputation as a regulator 
to beat regional competition to attract investment from 
overseas financial services firms.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador, accompanied by EconOff and 
EconFSN, visited the $1.3 billion BFH project on October 
17 for a project tour and multimedia presentation hosted 
by the chairman of Islamic investment bank, Gulf Finance 
House (GFH) Esam Janahi. Also present were Esam\'s uncle 
and lead designer/consultant for the project, Ahmed 
Janahi, and several other BFH officials.  The visit was 
covered in both English and Arabic newspapers.  The 
articles also highlighted the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA). 
 
3. (U) According to its designer, the BFH responds to the 
need for a modern work environment with top of the line 
business services as well as luxury housing and 
amenities.  It sits on reclaimed land on the coast west 
of downtown Manama.  The project includes both living and 
working space, a marina and space for a dhow port, as 
well as plans for a concert hall.  The first phase, 
planned for early 2007 and now ahead of schedule, 
includes two 53-story twin towers of office space; a 
\"Financial Mall\" which will house the Bahrain Stock 
Exchange as well as other brokerages, exchange bureaus, 
and consumer banking outlets; and a \"Harbor House\" that 
is designed to host specialized media firms and other 
financial sector support enterprises.  The three 
projects, a $250 million investment, will act as the 
centerpiece of the BFH. 
 
4.  (U) The BFH is seen by its investors as a complement 
to GOB efforts to promote the country as an international 
financial hub.  However, rather than targeting only 
larger institutions that might already have a regional 
presence, the BFH strategy is to attract mid-size 
financial institutions seeking to expand into new 
markets.  Investors believe the FTA will help market the 
BFH to this class of firms in the U.S.  The Ambassador 
stressed that while the FTA is an important framework for 
expanding commercial ties, it is the private sector that 
must take the lead in ensuring implementation is a 
success.  Esam Janahi agreed and highlighted the need to 
encourage new and innovative business ideas and projects 
like the BFH to help make Bahrain a more attractive 
investment destination. 
 
5.  (U) The Ambassador raised the issue of stiff regional 
competition, particularly from Dubai, and asked if 
Bahrain would be able to attract the number of firms 
required to make the BFH a success.  Janahi acknowledged 
there was room for concern, but underlined that the 
regulatory reputation of the Bahrain Monetary Agency 
would continue to draw financial institutions to 
establish their base of operations in Bahrain.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) The Ambassador November 2 delivered Ref A demarche to 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Abdul Ghaffar and 
Minister of Industry (and confidant of the King) Fakhro.  He 
also spoke with Minister of Justice Al Arrayed and President 
of the Court of Cassation Shaikh Khalifa Al Khalifa.  Abdul 
Ghaffar expressed his surprise that the four terror suspects 
had been released, but noted that the GOB would conduct tight 
24-hour surveillance.  They might be released, \"but they are 
not free,\" he said.  They will be back in court on December 
6.  Abdul Ghaffar said that the current situation was very 
different from that of last June, noting that the government 
had detained the suspects for almost four months, the police 
had conducted an investigation, and the suspects were now 
facing criminal charges in court.  Minister Fakhro told the 
Ambassador that the King had personally ordered 
round-the-clock surveillance, and added that the government 
would have liked nothing more than to keep the suspects in 
prison.  Minister Al Arrayed explained the nature of the 
criminal charges lodged against the four, and Shaikh Khalifa 
explained that one of the defense attorney\'s challenge of the 
charges on constitutional grounds held no water.  He admitted 
that the case against the suspects remained weak due to lack 
of evidence.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S) The Ambassador November 2 delivered Ref A demarche on 
U.S. concerns over the release of the four terror suspects to 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar. 
 The Ambassador also conveyed our concerns that the judge\'s 
decision to release the defendants came without prior 
warning.  The release had surprised and shaken us.  As a 
result, the U.S. could lose confidence in Bahrain as a 
partner in the fight against terrorism. 
 
-------------------- 
24-Hour Surveillance 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (S) Abdul Ghaffar stated that he also was surprised that 
the judge released the suspects, but said it was the judge\'s 
decision alone, and not that of the GOB.  The judicial branch 
was independent in Bahrain and the government was not 
permitted to intervene.  He promised the security services 
would conduct tight 24-hour surveillance of the four, stating 
they \"were released, but are not free.\" 
 
4.  (S) He noted that there were significant differences 
between this release and that of last June.  There is a court 
case under way, the suspects had been held in prison for 
three and a half months, the police had conducted a thorough 
investigation, and the defendants had been charged with 
violations of the penal code.  (Note:  Articles 155 and 157. 
End Note.)  They will return to court on December 6, the date 
of the next hearing.  Abdul Ghaffar said the government 
intends to win the case, and the four will \"remain in jail 
for years.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Bahrain Committed to Working Closely with USG 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S) Abdul Ghaffar stated that he had spoken with a 
Bahrain National Security Agency (BNSA) official before the 
meeting with the Ambassador, and the official had assured him 
that the BNSA had kept the USG informed at every stage of the 
investigation.  The USG had seen all the evidence against the 
four.  He emphasized that the GOB was committed to working 
closely with the U.S. against terrorism, and said that any 
possible future terrorist incident in Bahrain would first and 
foremost harm Bahrain\'s interests.  The GOB would not allow 
that to occur. 
 
6.  (S) The Ambassador reiterated our deep concern that the 
four were back on the street and stressed that surveillance 
must be thorough.  We were worried that the four might try to 
reestablish contact with their friends outside of Bahrain. 
Abdul Ghaffar agreed and assured the Ambassador that Bahrain 
would do all it could to stay on top of the four. 
 
--------------------- 
King Watching Closely 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (S) The Ambassador also delivered the demarche to 
Minister of Industry (and confidant to the King) Hassan 
Fakhro, stressing the importance of this issue to the U.S. 
and the possible negative ramifications if the case was not 
handled properly.   Fakhro said the government was well aware 
of the seriousness of the issue, and noted that the King had 
personally issued instructions ordering that the four 
released suspects be watched day and night.  The head of the 
BNSA had told him last night that the four had been followed 
from the moment they left the courthouse.  He said there is 
nothing the government would have liked better than to keep 
them in prison, but added the rule of law is also important 
to both the U.S. and Bahrain. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Charges of Damaging Public Property, Conspiracy 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.  (S) Separately, the Ambassador met with Minister of 
Justice Jawad Al Arrayed and President of the Court of 
Cassation (Supreme Court) Shaikh Khalifa bin Rashid Al 
Khalifa to express our concerns and to seek clarification on 
the status of the legal proceedings.  Minister Al Arrayed 
said that the four had been charged under two articles of the 
penal code: 155 and 157.  Article 155 calls, inter alia, for 
punishment of imprisonment for persons who intentionally 
vandalize public properties.  This would be used, he said, 
for the defendants, destruction of microphones in their 
jail.  \"We are trying to find anything against them,\" he 
said.  Article 157 calls for imprisonment for persons who 
take part in an agreement which aims at committing one of the 
felonies listed in Article 155.  (Note:  This is the way the 
current penal code addresses the charge of conspiracy, which 
remains the core charge.  End Note.) 
 
9.  (S) The Ambassador asked about the December 6 court date. 
 Shaikh Khalifa said that on of the defense lawyers was 
seeking dismissal of the charges on the grounds that Article 
157 was unconstitutional, and this would be heard on December 
6.   He said that there were absolutely no grounds for this, 
and in fact the two other defense lawyers agreed.  It was 
possible that the defense lawyer could appeal a negative 
court decision, but Shaikh Khalifa was the ultimate point of 
appeal, and his position was clear.  Nonetheless, Shaikh 
Khalifa conceded, it was not certain that the case would 
actually go to trial on December 6, pending further appeal. 
 
----------------------------- 
Evidentiary Case Remains Weak 
----------------------------- 
 
10.  (S)  Shaikh Khalifa brought with him a four-inch thick 
folder of documents, including, he said, 450 pages of 
interrogations, to support the prosecution.  Nonetheless, he 
said, the case remains weak.  There is no confession, and no 
specific, concrete crime to ask about.   Minister Al Arrayed 
stressed that the government is concerned about the case at 
the highest level.  \"They are our enemies as much as they are 
your enemies,\" he stated.  But it will be important to play 
the case just right.   He expressed confidence that the case 
was under control. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (S) With the release of the four suspects, we should not 
lose sight of the fact that the government held the suspects 
for almost four months, conducted an investigation including 
interrogation of the suspects, and will pursue a legal case 
against them.  The defendants and their lawyers, 
nevertheless, are depicting the November 1 decision as a 
clear victory for them and are suggesting it portends 
confirmation of their innocence.  The government is telling 
us they will pursue the case to its proper conclusion while 
maintaining tight surveillance on the suspects.  Our task 
will be to impress upon the GOB at all levels the crucial 
importance of doing just that.

comes at a critical stage.  The court\'s November 1 decision 
to release the four terrorism suspects sends the wrong signal 
on the GOB\'s commitment to fighting the war on terrorism. 
Your meeting with King Hamad represents the best opportunity 
to deliver our message to the highest level of the Bahraini 
government. 
 
2.  (S) Since mid-July, when the (then) six terrorism 
suspects were re-arrested, Bahraini officials from Prime 
Minister Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman down have told us 
that the GOB would conduct a thorough investigation and 
aggressive prosecution of the case.  The CP told Homeland 
Security Advisor Townsend and S/CT Ambassador Black September 
15 that the case against the remaining four detainees was 
getting stronger and agreed that the four \"must be put away.\" 
 While assuring us of their vigor in prosecuting the case, 
senior officials including Minister of Interior Rashid Al 
Khalifa have complained of the lack of hard evidence against 
the suspects. 
 
--------------------------- 
Detention Disrupts Planning 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) Given the assurances, we had expected the suspects to 
remain in detention during the course of the trial.  Though 
the outcome of the trial may have been in some doubt, 
according to the GOB, the suspects would have been held for 
three and a half months during the investigative period, and 
for the many months of the trial itself.  On a practical 
basis, their removal from the scene would have conclusively 
disrupted any planning they had completed previously.  It 
also would have sent a strong message that the GOB stood 
firmly against terrorism. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Consequences for Bilateral Relationship 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S) The judge\'s decision to release the suspects during 
the trial may have caught senior officials by surprise, as 
they have told us (Ref A).  We now must push the GOB to take 
the suspects back into custody.  At a minimum, they should be 
able to do this quickly and easily for Yasser Kamal, who fled 
the courthouse during a September hearing.  They also must 
know that by not aggressively pursuing this case, they will 
put into jeopardy further progress on issues of bilateral 
interest, such as expeditious ratification and implementation 
of the free trade agreement and cooperation on CT issues 
through the ATA program and the establishment of a 
counter-terrorism operations center at the Ministry of 
Interior and other sensitive CT cooperation with RMAS. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Human Rights Advocates Under Pressure 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S) You also can express our concern about the GOB\'s 
closure and dissolution of the Bahrain Center for Human 
Rights and detention of several human rights advocates and 
youth for organizing and participating in a rally in support 
of activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja.  There is an apparent 
disconnect between the vigor with which the GOB has pursued 
these cases (all Shias) and the terrorism suspects (Sunnis). 
 
------------------------- 
Suggested Issues to Raise 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (S) Suggested Talking Points: 
 
 
Terrorism 
--------- 
-- The war on terrorism is deadly serious. 
 
-- Governments must use all legal means available, especially 
the justice system, to pursue terrorists aggressively. 
 
-- We are very concerned that Bahrain is not doing this. 
 
-- The court\'s release of the four suspects even before the 
trial has started has deeply shaken our confidence that 
Bahrain is with us in the global war on terror. 
-- We have raised all along our concerns about the suspects 
and that they be dealt with seriously.  We have seen the 
Bahraini government, however, take a different path.  The 
government: 
 
  -- released the six suspects in June; 
  -- again released two of the six suspects in September; 
  -- allowed Yasser Kamal to flee the courthouse in September; 
  -- provided no advance warning that the judge was going to 
release the four remaining suspects on November 1. 
 
-- We urge you to find a way to put the suspects back into 
custody.  This should be easy to do for Yasser Kamal, who 
clearly demonstrated that he is a flight risk when he fled 
the courthouse in September. 
 
-- We are quite concerned that the case against the suspects 
could be dropped as early as December 6, when the judge will 
hear a constitutional challenge to the charges filed against 
them. 
 
-- Bahrain\'s actions cause us to question its commitment in 
the war on terror, and sends a signal to the world -- 
especially to the terrorists -- that Bahrain is soft on 
terrorism. 
 
(Watch Out For:  Independent Judiciary) 
 
-- Understand judiciary is independent.  We are urging you to 
pursue the case aggressively so the prosecution has what it 
needs to win the case and put these men away for a long time. 
 
 
Bilateral Relations 
------------------- 
-- We are now at a moment of great opportunity.  We are on 
the verge of ratifying and implementing the free trade 
agreement, and the U.S. Navy is evaluating its future support 
for the Bahrain School. 
 
-- Questions about Bahrain\'s commitment to the war on terror 
will have an impact. 
 
-- The FTA will be meaningless if business people have doubts 
about the security situation in Bahrain. 
 
-- We can only expand our bilateral cooperation in security 
and counter-terrorism in an environment of trust.  We will 
have to reconsider our plans for anti-terrorism assistance to 
the Ministry of Interior and our help in the establishment of 
a counter-terrorism operations center and other security and 
intelligence assistance. 
 
 
Human Rights Situation 
---------------------- 
-- The GOB\'s decision to close and dissolve the Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights attracted quite a bit of attention in 
the United States. 
 
-- As you work through this issue, we hope that Bahrain 
continues on its admirable path of reform and democracy. 
 
-- In keeping with the rule of law, we hope there are no 
steps backward on protecting and promoting civil society and 
democratic institutions. 
 
-- We encourage you to find a way to re-open the Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights.  It is an important symbol of 
Bahrain\'s commitment to human rights.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN SCHOOL: PRESERVE THE DOD CONNECTION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.5 (D) 
 
1. (C) We now face, as we did last summer, an urgent decision 
regarding the DODEA-sponsored Bahrain School: should we 
continue to support it as a DODEA school, or should we begin 
the process of conversion to a more traditional international 
school.  While the school does indeed fit the profile of an 
international school, especially in the absence of Navy 
dependents, strong policy reasons argue for a continuation of 
DODEA sponsorship, which has created a unique institution in 
the Arab and Muslim world.  I strongly urge that on policy 
grounds a decision be made now to continue the school beyond 
this year as a DODEA institution. 
 
2. (C) The Bahrain School has been an important part of the 
landscape of our bilateral relationship for over 35 years. 
Its importance goes far beyond that of an educational 
institution.  It serves as a symbol of the positive role that 
the U.S. Navy plays in Bahrain.  It has educated key members 
of Bahrain\'s political, economic, and security leadership, 
who are now sending their children there.  It has played a 
central role in instilling American values and attitudes in 
Bahrainis who are key supporters of our bilateral 
relationship.  The 9/11 Commission calls for the 
establishment of a fund to build and operate schools in the 
Muslim world.  We already have a model school in Bahrain, run 
by the U.S. Department of Defense, widely appreciated by 
Bahrainis, and teaching the values of the American education 
system.  To pull the plug now simply does not make sense from 
a policy perspective. 
 
3. (C) Transition to a traditional international school is an 
option from a purely educational point of view.  The Bahrain 
International School Association (BISA) is, in fact, 
exploring that option if DODEA withdraws its support.  The 
BISA Board and the Government of Bahrain have been 
unequivocal, however, that their strong preference is for the 
Bahrain School to remain a DODEA institution. 
 
4. (C) If we decide to withdraw DODEA sponsorship of the 
school, we must be clear about what we will lose: 
 
-- cutting the DOD ties may in time lead to an erosion of 
support for our Navy presence in Bahrain. 
 
-- we will lose a powerful symbol of the positive benefit of 
official U.S.-Bahrain engagement, and of the U.S. military 
presence here. 
 
-- we will no longer be able to guarantee the current quality 
of education provided by the Bahrain School if/when the U.S. 
Navy decides to bring any dependents back to Bahrain. 
 
-- future generations of Bahraini students will not develop 
the bonds towards the U.S. and its Navy that the school has 
so successfully nurtured. 
 
-- an international school, without the DODEA affiliation, 
simply will not have the same positive impact on bilateral 
relations that the existing school has. 
 
5. (C) Coming on the heels of the decision last summer by the 
Navy to remove its dependents from Bahrain, a decision to 
withdraw DODEA support for the school will raise doubts, both 
in the government but also among the Bahraini public in 
general, about the strength of the U.S. commitment to 
Bahrain.  They will wonder if this is the start of 
disengagement from Bahrain. 
 
6. (C) The presence of DOD\'s Bahrain School has served U.S. 
policy well over the years.  Withdrawing USG support of this 
landmark institution at a time when the U.S. is engaged in a 
battle for the hearts and minds of the people in the region 
would risk throwing away much of the goodwill and positive 
influence that the school has helped accrue over the years, 
and foreclose potential opportunities for the future.  I 
truly hope we can make the policy decision to maintain the 
school as a DODEA institution.

--  The Ambassador hosted a lively youth-oriented U.S.

More than one hundred University of Bahrain students, NGO 
representatives, journalists, and government officials 
attended.  Eleven Mass Communications undergraduates who 
interned last summer in Chicago media outlets assisted 
the PAO with a mock balloting program that was a big hit 
with the guests.  (The internships in Chicago were 
supported by the FY 04 DePaul/University of Bahrain MEPI

majlis speaker was U.S. Fulbright Scholar Dr. Scott 
Waalkes, who explained how his native Ohio was critical 
in determining the outcome of the election, and responded 
to inquiries from students. 
 
--  The DCM hosted a ladies-only Ghabqa (late dinner) on 
October 24 in her Residence for Bahrain\'s female movers 
and shakers (and Shaikhas) who work in education, the 
media, business, NGOs, and the government.  The guests 
represented all segments of Bahraini society, from 
members of the royal family and Western-educated 
secularists to veiled public school teachers.  A large 
delegation from the Bahrain Businesswomen\'s Society 
arrived en masse, providing the DCM and Emboffs a perfect

Free Trade Agreement in an informal Ramadan setting. 
Guests discussed recent proposals by some ultra- 
conservative Members of Parliament to transform the 
University of Bahrain, the only co-ed public university 
in the Gulf, into segregated male/female campuses. 
Perceived as a real set-back to women in Bahrain, this

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) The Ambassador met with Prime Minister Khalifa bin 
Salman Al Khalifa November 8 for a discussion that included 
counter-terrorism, Iraq, and human rights.  He expressed the 
USG\'s deep concern about the judge\'s release of the four 
terrorism suspects on November 1 and urged the GOB to use all 
legal means available to prosecute them.  The PM replied that 
he would not allow anything to harm U.S. interests in the 
Kingdom and noted that the suspects are under surveillance. 
He said that Iraqi President Yawar was staying in Bahrain for 
an extended period in order to spend time with his family, 
which is visiting from Saudi Arabia, and this provided a good 
opportunity for the Bahrain leadership to get to know him. 
The Ambassador raised the closure of the Bahrain Center for 
Human Rights and suggested that allowing the Center to 
re-open would send a strong signal on openness in Bahrain. 
The PM replied that while Bahrain is an open society, some 
people try to abuse this to cause divisions.  He said that 
Bahrain is committed to the rule of law and a free society 
and there is no going back.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
U.S. Concern About Release of Terror Suspects 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S) The Ambassador called on Prime Minister Khalifa 
November 8 and discussed a range of issues, including 
counter-terrorism, Iraq, and human rights.  Noting that the 
Deputy Secretary had met with King Hamad the evening before, 
the Ambassador stated that the United States is deeply 
concerned about the outcome of the court case for the four 
terrorism suspects.  We regard them as being very dangerous. 
The Ambassador urged the GOB to use all legal means available 
to prosecute them energetically and to keep them off the 
street as long as possible.  Their November 1 release by the 
judge sends the wrong signal about Bahrain\'s commitment to 
fighting terrorism. 
 
3.  (S) The Prime Minister replied that Bahrain will work 
very hard to ensure that nothing harms U.S. interests in the 
Kingdom.  The four suspects are under surveillance and can be 
brought in and questioned at any time.  He would not let the 
suspects move without being monitored.  The PM said, \"your 
security is our security,\" and he would not let anything 
endanger Bahrain\'s security and stability. 
 
--------------------- 
Getting To Know Yawar 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The PM stated that Iraqi President Yawar was staying 
in Bahrain for an extended period, visiting with his family 
which lives in Saudi Arabia and is now also here.  Yawar 
planned to return to Iraq before the Eid Al Fitr holiday, 
expected to begin on November 14.  The PM said Bahrain 
appreciated Yawar\'s visit as it allowed the country\'s 
leadership to get to know him better.  He said that Bahrain 
was ready to support Iraq in any way it could, noting the 
current program to train up to 4,000 Iraqi firefighters. 
 
---------------------------- 
Re-open Human Rights Center? 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador explained that while the United States 
was appreciative of Bahrain\'s progress on reform, many people 
had noticed certain recent moves such as the GOB\'s decision 
to close and dissolve the Bahrain Center for Human Rights 
(BCHR), and wondered what it meant.  Did the move signal a 
change in direction for Bahrain?  We understand that the 
issue is complex, but we are looking for confirmation that 
Bahrain will continue to move in a positive direction.  The 
BCHR may have done some things that the GOB considers 
mistakes, but permitting the Center to re-open would send a 
strong signal about Bahrain\'s openness. 
 
6.  (C) The PM stated that Bahrain is an example of openness 
and reform in the Gulf.  However, some people try to abuse 
this openness.  Democracy is not the freedom to divide people 
and disregard laws.  When citizens follow the law and respect 
order, there are no problems.  The Ambassador pointed out 
that there are those in any society who push the envelope and 
may even go too far.  But this should not bring about an 
overreaction. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Bahrainis United Under Constitution and Law 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The Prime Minister said that anyone could see that 
the human rights situation in Bahrain was good.  Bahrain is 
the deputy chair of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva 
and there are human rights organizations in Bahrain other 
than the BCHR.  However, there are those who use human rights 
as cover for other activities, and the GOB must show that it 
is not fooled by them.  Bahrain is committed to rule of law 
and a free society, and there is no going back.  Bahrain\'s 
citizens are united under the constitution and the law. 
There will be municipal elections in 2005, and the government 
wants the people to participate in the elections and it looks 
forward to working with the election winners.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN TO HOST INAUGURAL MENA FATF MEETING 
 
 
1.  (U) Bahrain will host the inaugural meeting of the Middle 
East/North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENA FATF) on 
November 29-30.  The establishment of a FATF-styled regional 
body in the Middle East and North Africa is, according to the 
Bahrain Monetary Agency\'s (BMA) Compliance chief, \"an 
important initiative to help bring the region into compliance 
with international standards.\"  In the wake of September 11 
the international financial community, through FATF, has 
redoubled its efforts to combat money laundering and 
terrorism financing by promoting transparency, best practices 
and sound regulatory regimes. 
 
2.  (U) For the inaugural meeting, Bahrain invited the 
Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors from Algeria, 
Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, 
Yemen, Tunisia, Jordan, Morocco and Syria to attend. 
Additionally, Bahrain invited delegations from the US, Iraq, 
France, UK, IMF, World Bank, and FATF as observers.  While 
most of the GCC countries responded affirmatively to their 
invitations, MENA FATF organizers are still awaiting 
responses from Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Saudi 
Arabia.  (Note. The North African countries attended and were 
active participants in the organizational meeting in Manama 
earlier this year. End note.) 
 
3.  (U) The first day of the conference, November 29, will be 
the technical meeting to draft the MOU, select a president 
and vice president and to discuss other planning issues.  On 
November 30, the conference attendees will sign the MOU and 
hold a press conference to announce the new president and 
vice president of the MENA FATF. 
 
4.  (U) Comment:  The Financial Action Task Force is an 
intergovernmental body that develops and promotes policies to 
combat money laundering and terrorism financing.  FATF 
encouraged the establishment of regional bodies to promote 
self-regulation.  There are already regional bodies in the 
Caribbean, Asia/Pacific, Eastern and Southern Africa, and 
Europe, leaving the Middle East and North Africa as a notable 
exception. The BMA recognized that implementing international 
standards would enhance and protect the stability of 
Bahrain\'s financial sector.  The BMA actively courted FATF 
and regularly participated in plenary and regional meetings 
before winning approval to initiate and host the MENA FATF. 
Bahrain still has room to improve the regulations in its 
financial sector but expects its strong proactive example to 
serve as a model for the region.

SUBJECT: SHOUTING MATCH ERUPTS IN PARLIAMENT OVER FALLUJAH 
STATEMENT 
 
Classified by DCM Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U) Shia and Sunni deputies in the Council of 
Representatives (COR) engaged in a heated shouting match 
November 9 during debate over a statement condemning the U.S. 
attack in Fallujah.  Twenty-four of the 40 COR members 
forwarded a written request to issue a statement to chairman 
Khalifa Al Dhahrani, who called for discussion of the issue. 
The Ambassador, who had just met with the leadership of the 
Shura Council, the appointed upper house of parliament, 
witnessed the fracas from the visitors balcony. 
 
2.  (U) The head of the Islamic bloc (Shia), Ali Samaheji, 
took the floor and called the insurgents in Fallujah 
\"merciless killers and terrorists.\"  He continued, \"We should 
focus on backing others who are in real distress and not a 
bunch of criminals who are causing chaos and destruction in 
Iraq.\"  He asked why the COR should issue a statement 
condemning the attack when the Interim Iraqi Government 
supported it.  By the passing the resolution, they are 
interfering in the internal affairs of another Arab country. 
Dhahrani tried to bring the matter to a vote, but Independent 
bloc president Abdul Aziz Al Moussa demanded that Samaheji 
first withdraw his \"insulting\" remarks.  Others jumped into 
the fray, shouting and calling each other \"childish\" and 
\"irrational.\"  The COR eventually issued the statement. 
 
3.  (C) Comment:  The controversy broke down along sectarian 
lines.  The Sunnis members, concerned about their 
co-religionists in Fallujah, pushed for and succeeded in 
getting the statement condemning the attack.  Only the 
Islamic bloc, the sole Shia grouping in the COR, opposed.  In 
August, while the conflict in (Shia) Najaf was underway, 
Bahrainis of both sects supported a COR statement against the 
American role there and several Sunni leaders joined in Shia 
marches against the U.S. action.  Shia deputies do not feel 
the same need to close ranks on the Fallujah situation 
because they consider the insurgents there to be foreign 
terrorists, not Iraqis.

REF: MANAMA 1671 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) The Deputy Secretary met with King Hamad November 7 
to discuss Bahrain\'s counter-terrorism efforts, the situation 
in Iraq, and Bahrain\'s relations with its neighbors.  The 
King opened the meeting with a surprise proposal to commit a 
company of special forces troops to Afghanistan as part of 
the UAE contingent there.  The King offered to travel to 
Washington within the next few weeks to develop the proposal. 
 The Deputy Secretary expressed his concern about the court\'s 
November 1 release of the four terrorism suspects.  The King 
replied that the case was a real problem for him; the GOB 
could not control the court.  He added that the government 
had taken Yasser Kamal, one of the four suspects, back into 
custody on charges related to his September flight from the 
courtroom following a hearing.  He will be prosecuted on 
these charges.  The Deputy Secretary stressed that it was 
important for Bahrain to do everything legally possible to 
prosecute the four.  The King said the government was 
monitoring the suspects closely.  On Iraq, the Deputy 
Secretary reported that Prime Minister Allawi was ready to 
 
SIPDIS 
attack Fallujah.  A joint U.S.-Iraqi force would carry out 
the operation.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The Deputy Secretary, accompanied by the Ambassador, 
NEA Assistant Secretary Burns, PM DAS Bue, and Pol/Econ chief 
(notetaker), met with King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa on 
November 7.  Also attending from the Bahraini side was Crown 
Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, Defense 
Minister LTG Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bahraini Special Forces to Afghanistan 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The King opened the meeting by congratulating the 
President on winning reelection and emphasizing Bahrain\'s 
eagerness to further strengthen the bilateral relationship. 
He stated that in response to the President\'s call for unity 
in the face of global terrorism, Bahrain is ready to commit a 
company of special forces troops to Afghanistan as part of 
the UAE force.  The King said he had spoken to Abu Dhabi 
Crown Prince and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaikh Mohammed 
bin Zayed Al Nahyan about this and he had agreed to host, 
support, and transport the Bahraini troops. 
 
4.  (C) The Deputy Secretary thanked the King for the offer, 
stating that that the President would be grateful for 
Bahrain\'s participation in the OEF coalition.  He noted that 
the Emirati contingent had taken some casualties and the 
Bahrainis would be exposed to danger.  The King understood 
and asked whether he should visit Washington soon to develop 
the idea.  (Note:  In a November 8 follow-up discussion on 
this point, Abdul Ghaffar passed along the King\'s proposal 
that the King visit Washington within the next few weeks. 
See septel.  End Note.)  The Deputy Secretary assured the 
King that he was welcome in Washington.  The Deputy Secretary 
said that he would discuss the proposal with U.S. commanders 
in Afghanistan, where he would travel this week. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Concern About Counter-Terrorism Efforts 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S) The Deputy Secretary commented that troops on the 
ground in Afghanistan could make Bahrain into a bigger target 
for terrorists.  The King replied that the Bahraini people 
trust his judgment and would understand the measure in the 
context of Bahrain\'s reform program. 
6.  (S) Continuing on the subject of counter-terrorism, the 
Deputy Secretary expressed his concern about the court\'s 
November 1 release of the four terrorism suspects, 
particularly Yasser Kamal, who had fled the courtroom 
following a September hearing.  While respecting the 
separation of powers, the Deputy Secretary said that the 
release was a real problem for us. 
 
----------------------- 
Rearrest of One Suspect 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (S) The King stated that he did not know how to solve 
this problem.  Bahrain no longer had a state security law 
permitting extended detention of suspects.  The government 
now had to allow the courts to act as they see fit.  Rule of 
law is important.  He acknowledged that the suspects could be 
dangerous, but asserted that they drew no support from the 
Bahraini people, who condemned them for considering killing 
civilians.  There had been no demonstrations in support of 
the suspects.  He confessed that he had become mad when the 
court released them, and said that the government was 
monitoring them closely. 
 
8.  (S) Crown Prince Salman pointed out that the GOB could 
not control the judge if he decided at a later date that the 
prosecution had no case against the suspects.  He stated his 
understanding that the primary U.S. interest was the arrest 
and detention of the four, which would disrupt their 
planning.  This had been achieved.  When Kamal fled the 
courtroom in September, the CP said, \"it was a gift from God\" 
as it gave the prosecution a concrete offense to charge him 
with.  The King said that the GOB had taken Kamal back into 
custody on these grounds following his November 1 release. 
 
---------------------------- 
All Legal Means to Prosecute 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  (S) The Deputy Secretary stressed that it was important 
for both Bahrain and the U.S. that the GOB do everything 
legally possible to prosecute the suspects.  There were 
questions about whether Bahrain was doing all it could in 
this regard.  The GOB should stay in touch with us on this 
case.  The Deputy Secretary warned that there could be 
implications for the (DOD) Bahrain School.  He said that he 
strongly advocated continued USG support for the school.  It 
would not be a good thing if the suspects disappeared.  The 
King said that U.S. troops had been shot at in many countries 
in the Gulf and Middle East regions, but not in Bahrain. 
Bahrain had participated in defending Kuwait and was helping 
on Iraq.  Bahrain does the right thing on Gulf security.  He 
assured the Deputy Secretary that Bahrain would be there for 
the U.S. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Yawar Appreciation for U.S. Role 
-------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) In response to the Deputy Secretary\'s question, the 
King said that Iraqi President Yawar was still in Bahrain, 
spending time with family members visiting from Saudi Arabia. 
 The King said that he had met with Yawar twice and hosted 
him for dinner.  Yawar intends to visit Washington at the end 
of November.  President Yawar is confident he is doing the 
right thing in Iraq, and recognizes there would be no way to 
make progress without the United States.  The King reported 
that he told Yawar Bahrain will host the GCC summit in 
December, and the King would like to deliver something for 
Iraq. 
 
---------------------- 
Fallujah Strike Coming 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (C) The Deputy Secretary indicated that he had met with 
Prime Minister Allawi during his visit to Iraq.  Allawi is 
fed up and is ready to strike Fallujah.  A sizable military 
force of MNF and Iraqi troops are poised to enter the city. 
Allawi believes that the IIG must move to confront the 
insurgents, as dialogue and negotiations have not succeeded. 
Regarding elections, the King questioned whether they had to 
take place in January.  He thought that the timing was not as 
important as holding good elections.  The Deputy Secretary 
said that the insurgents would treat a delay as a victory. 
The Deputy Secretary noted comments by Grand Ayatollah 
Sistani which suggest that the Ayatollah advocates democracy 
and participation in the elections, but not support for an 
Iranian style government. 
 
------------------------------- 
Some Friction with Saudi Arabia 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) The Deputy Secretary asked about the reactions of 
Gulf states to Bahrain\'s participation in the G8 Summit in 
Sea Island, Georgia last June and leadership role in the 
Broader Middle East/North Africa initiative.  The King 
replied that while he was careful to speak favorably in 
public about other GCC countries at the summit, they were 
clearly unhappy about Bahrain\'s prominence.  Though not 
necessarily connected, the King mentioned that there had been 
some friction recently with Saudi Arabia on the economic 
front.  He noted that the SAG had recently stopped a gift of 
50,000 barrels per day of oil.  (Note:  The King sent the 
Crown Prince to Saudi Arabia in the past few days to discuss 
this issue.  End Note.)

1.  (SBU) After a four month wait, the Bahraini Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) is expected to approve the 
establishment of the Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society 
within the next ten days.  The board of the group, led by 
Shura Council member Faisal Foulad, includes women, 
unionists, Shias, Sunnis, a Christian, and a Jew.  Foulad 
told PolOff November 17 that the group will operate 
independently of the government and will monitor human rights 
violations in the country and advocate reforms that support 
human rights.  Al Ayam newspaper incorrectly reported that 
MOLSA had already approved the establishment of the society. 
 
2.  (SBU) Foulad said that the society will focus on 
monitoring the rights of women, children, and foreign 
workers, and will report on discrimination in all forms, 
especially religious discrimination.  The society will seek 
to develop laws that support international agreements on 
human rights, particularly the UN Declaration on Human 
Rights.  Foulad said his group has good relations with 
international and local NGOs and hoped that the GOB allows 
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights to re-open soon.  Despite 
its name, the new organization has no formal association with 
Human Rights Watch. 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment: Foulad is an outspoken advocate for human 
rights who will work within the system to promote individual 
rights and prevent discrimination.  As a member of the 
(appointed) Shura Council, he is in a position to influence 
government policy; however, others view him as too close to 
the regime to play an effective role.  His organization is 
not intended to replace the closed and dissolved Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights, which was willing to push the 
envelope and, at times, provoked the ire of the GOB.  But the 
Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society is a welcome addition to 
the Kingdom\'s civil society scene.

1. (U) Summary:  On October 13 the Ambassador toured the 
Bahrain Investors Center (BIC), the Ministry of 
Commerce\'s newly launched \"one-stop shop\" for investors. 
The BIC is the GOB\'s first e-Commerce and e-Government 
initiative.  It removes much of the red tape that had 
stalled Bahrain\'s efforts to compete with its neighbors 
for new investment.  The BIC, along with other reform 
initiatives, is part of an effort to promote Bahrain as a 
hub for firms looking for a regional home base.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Bahrain Investment Center (BIC) is part of the 
Ministry of Commerce\'s 2003-2006 plan to enhance the 
country\'s market competitiveness by attracting local, 
regional, and international investment to Bahrain. 
Inaugurated in October 2004, the BIC is a high-tech, 
customer-friendly and easy to find facility, located in 
one of Bahrain\'s largest malls, that offers assistance to 
both Bahrainis and foreigners.  It is part of a larger 
effort by the GOB to attract firms to use Bahrain as 
their \"Gateway to the Gulf\" by setting up regional 
operations here.  According to Commerce officials, the 
BIC is the first step on the GOB\'s path towards a 
comprehensive and effective e-Government system. 
 
3. (U) The BIC is designed as a \"one-stop shop\" providing 
all commercial licensing and registration services.  It 
houses representatives from all relevant ministries (over 
a dozen) and private sector representatives from the 
telecommunication, legal, banking, and consulting 
industries under one roof.  The U.S.-based consulting 
firm Ernst and Young has a booth and the BIC will also 
include a booth dedicated to promoting the U.S.- Bahrain 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which will cater the needs of 
U.S. investors. 
 
4. (U) Under the previous commercial registration system, 
registering a new company took an average of two to five 
weeks.  In fact, according to Commerce Undersecretary 
Abdulla Mansour, the red tape that plagued the previous 
system significantly delayed 99.9 percent of all 
commercial applications.  Today the BIC can process and 
issue 80 percent of commercial registration applications 
within 24 hours and 90 percent of commercial 
registrations within five working days.  The remaining 10 
percent, mostly those having to do with health, 
environment, power and or other essential services, are 
processed separately according to sector specific 
regulations.  As of November 8, 130 companies with a 
capital of $500 million were registered at BIC.  Sixty 
percent of 2004\'s commercial registrations were 
registered during the two-month trial period, prior to 
the Center\'s official opening ceremony in October. 
 
5. (U) An essential element of the BIC is its website. 
Online services currently available include details on 
company activities, shareholders and investment capital. 
The GOB plans to include an online registration and 
payment option in the future allowing companies to 
register in Bahrain without ever having to travel to 
Manama.

2.  (C) Ambassador, noting that he had been called personally 
by Under Secretary Bolton on the subject, delivered reftel 
points on completing Article 98 agreements November 20 to 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar. 
 Abdul Ghaffar responded that, agreement or not, Bahrain 
would never deliver an American citizen, whether civilian or 
military, to a third country.  He said that ratification of 
the agreement signed by the U.S. and Bahrain in February 2003 
would have to go through the Council of Representatives 
(COR), which is controlled by Islamists.  Abdul Ghaffar 
stated that he could not guarantee the COR would pass the 
agreement, and even presenting it to parliament could \"open a 
Pandora\'s Box.\"  He thought that if the regional scene was 
calmer, and there was progress on the Roadmap and in Iraq, 
there would be a better chance of the COR approving the 
agreement. 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador expressed his disappointment with 
Abdul Ghaffar\'s response and urged him to reconsider.  The 
Ambassador noted that the Kuwaiti government intended to 
present the Article 98 agreement to its parliament for 
ratification, and perhaps Bahrain could learn from this 
experience.  Abdul Ghaffar agreed, but said that the 
situation in Kuwait was different from that in Bahrain. 
 
4.  (C) The Ambassador suggested that the GOB consider 
ratifying the agreement through an exchange of diplomatic 
notes with the USG rather than through parliament.  Abdul 
Ghaffar said he would task the legal office to research 
whether this option is consistent with Bahrain\'s 
constitution.  He asked if we could pass him sample text for 
an exchange of diplomatic notes on Article 98. 
 
5.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar stated he would arrive in Washington on 
Tuesday, November 23 in advance of King Hamad\'s November 29 
visit.  He offered to meet with Under Secretary Bolton to 
discuss this issue, if so desired. 
 
6.  (C) Action Request:  Please forward a draft diplomatic

Article 98 ratification.  E-mail to Pol/Econ chief Steve

SMALL CROWDS 
 
REF: MANAMA 1707 
 
Sensitive but unclassified (deliberative process); please 
protect accordingly.  Not for Internet distribution. 
 
1.  (U) Organizers had estimated that the two protests 
against U.S. and Iraqi military action in Fallujah would draw 
10,000 people.  In the end, only 350 people total took part 
in the November 19 demonstrations.  Though Al Wifaq President 
and prominent Shia leader Ali Salman was at the front of one 
protest, few Shia participated.  Both demonstrations were 
peaceful. 
 
2.  (U) The first rally immediately followed Friday prayers 
at the Al Fateh Grand Mosque.   Approximately 200 people (RSO 
estimate) including members of parliament marched for an hour 
and a half.  Al Wifaq President Ali Salman and several Shia 
clergymen were present, but very few other Shia participated 
despite Salman\'s calls for Shia to turn out for the 
demonstration. Protesters carried signs condemning U.S. 
forces and demanding their withdrawal from Iraq.  They also 
condemned the Iraqi Interim Government as well as Iraqi 
insurgents who kill civilians.  Protesters stomped on and 
burned an American and an Israeli flag.  The second 
demonstration took place in Muharraq and was attended by 150 
people (RSO estimate); few if any were Shia.  The leaders and 
organizers of the Muharraq demonstration were Sunni Salafis, 
including parliamentarian Mohammed Khalid who days earlier 
had publicly insulted Bahrain\'s Shia for not condemning the 
Fallujah attack more vigorously (reftel).  The Governor of 
Muharraq also reportedly participated.  Participants accused 
the United States of serious human rights violations in 
Fallujah and criticized attacks on mosques. 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment: Despite the low turnout for the 
demonstrations, many Bahrainis are angry about the MNF-I and 
Iraqi attack on Fallujah.  They are particularly seized with 
the media image of the Marine shooting an apparently unarmed 
fighter and with press reports that few insurgents in 
Fallujah were foreign.  This emotion has been on display in 
newspaper editorials and cartoons and in sermons in both 
Sunni and Shia mosques.  But Shia Bahrainis, who are more 
likely to take to the streets than Sunnis, have decided not 
to do so at this time because of lingering resentment over 
Mohammed Khalid\'s antics in parliament and a real lack of 
connection to the insurgents in Fallujah, who many view as 
mostly terrorists along the lines of Zarqawi.

1.  (SBU) On November 21, activist and former Executive 
Director of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) Abdul 
Hadi Al Khawaja was convicted and sentenced to one year in 
prison and ordered to begin serving the term immediately.  He 
had been charged with violating Article 165 (public 
incitement against the regime) and Article 168 (spreading 
rumors that could disrupt national security) of the penal 
code.  In reading the verdict, the judge did not specify 
under what article(s) Al Khawaja was found guilty.  Al 
Khawaja and his family members had refused to attend the 
hearing.  Approximately 10 people were inside the courtroom 
including Cairo-based Amnesty International representative 
Joanna Oyediran and journalists from BBC Arabic, AP, and 
Reuters.  The court rejected defense lawyers\' claims that the 
charges against Al Khawaja were unconstitutional.  Outside 
the courtroom, a passionate crowd of 300 Al Khawaja 
supporters gathered with signs and called on Prime Minister 
Khalifa to resign.  They chanted inflammatory slogans 
including \"Die Khalifa\" and \"The People Don\'t Want You.\" 
Court guards were the only security officials present and 
made no attempt to interfere with the crowd. 
 
2.  (SBU) Later the same day, at about 6:00 PM, the King 
issued a decree limiting the imprisonment to the 57 days 
already served and ordered Al Khawaja\'s immediate release. 
Photographs of him in a car with his wife on their way home 
appeared in local newspapers.  Though many media outlets 
called the King\'s decree a pardon, legally it was a 
suspension of the remainder of the sentence.  The King also 
ordered the release of 13 detainees still being held in 
connection with the October 28 \"car parade\" in support of Al 
Khawaja (Ref A). 
 
3.  (SBU) Political and human rights activists welcomed the 
King\'s gesture and some described it as evidence of the top 
leadership\'s desire to continue its democratic reforms. 
However, many expressed dismay that Al Khawaja was imprisoned 
and put on trial in the first place.  BCHR President Nabeel 
Rajab told PolFSN that the King\'s handling of the matter sent 
a strong message that although he had forgiven Al Khawaja, he 
would not tolerate criticism of his family.  Representatives 
of several human rights organizations said they would push 
for changes in the penal code to remove Article 156, which 
criminalizes criticism of the royal family.  Some activists 
(unrelated to the Committee in Support of Al Khawaja, which 
had suspended its activities) planned an evening 
demonstration in the suburb of Budaiya against Al Khawaja\'s 
conviction and sentence, but canceled the event at the last 
minute upon learning of the King\'s decree. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment:  The sentencing of Al Khawaja to a year in 
prison and the King\'s subsequent pardon demonstrate the mixed 
nature of the GOB\'s path towards a more democratic system. 
Al Khawaja\'s arrest and imprisonment were a warning to 
activists not to push the envelope too far, but the King\'s 
pardon showed that he can respond to their concerns when he 
believes it appropriate.  Some human rights advocates are now 
looking to the next step:  finding a way to re-open the 
Bahrain Center for Human Rights.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER:  KING HAMAD\'S NOVEMBER 29 VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d) 
 
1.  (S) King Hamad requested to visit Washington to 
congratulate the President on his reelection, reaffirm 
Bahrain\'s strong support for U.S. Iraq policy and the war on 
terrorism, and consult with the President on Bahrain\'s 
hosting of the December 20 GCC Summit and outcomes the USG 
would like from the summit on Iraq, Iran, and 
Israel/Palestine.  We should take the opportunity to raise 
our concerns about Bahrain\'s lack of seriousness in combating 
terrorism from within the Kingdom, and potential steps 
backwards in respecting human rights and freedom of assembly. 
 We should also discuss Bahrain\'s leadership in the Broader 
Middle East/North Africa reform initiative, the King\'s offer 
to deploy a special forces company to Afghanistan embedded in 
the Emirati contingent already in theater, and ratification 
of the U.S.-Bahrain free trade agreement (FTA). 
 
---------- 
Objectives 
---------- 
 
2.  (S) What we want from the visit: 
 
-- Commitment by the King to deal forcefully and effectively 
with terrorist threats within Bahrain, most notably with the 
four terrorist suspects that were initially detained last 
June. 
 
-- Recognition by the King that, while we are deeply 
appreciative of the positive moves he has taken towards 
democracy, we view with concern possible steps backwards, 
such as the closing down of the Bahrain Human Rights Center 
and possible new restrictions on freedom of assembly.  His 
November 21 pardon of human rights activist Abdul Hadi Al 
Khawaja sends the right message to Bahrain\'s civil society. 
 
-- Continued Bahraini support, both politically and in 
practical terms, for our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as 
well as OEF maritime operations. 
 
----------------------------- 
Issues of Interest to Bahrain 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) What the King wants from the visit: 
 
-- Reaffirmation of what he feels is his strong personal 
relationship with the President, as exemplified by the 
invitation to be the first regional leader to visit the White 
House since the election. 
 
-- Recognition that he is a close friend who remains in 
lock-step with the Bush administration on the key issues of 
Iraq, Iran, and counter-terrorism. 
 
-- Message from the President that he can personally bring to 
the GCC Summit, which he will host in Bahrain on December 20, 
on Iraq, Iran, and Israel/Palestine. 
 
-- Administration commitment to press for expeditious 
congressional ratification of the FTA. 
 
------------------- 
Key Issues to Raise 
------------------- 
 
4.  (S) We suggest making the following points: 
 
-- We greatly value Bahrain\'s support on Iraq and 
Afghanistan, including the King\'s recent offer to provide a 
company of special forces in support of OEF in Afghanistan. 
 
-- Understand that the King will host the GCC Summit December 
20, and appreciate his desire to consult with us in advance 
to help him develop a positive outcome for the meeting.  (Use 
opportunity to make points on Iraq, Iran, and 
Israel/Palestine.) 
 
-- The Global War on Terror remains the administration\'s 
overriding priority.  We need Bahrain\'s help.  We remain 
extremely concerned about the four terror suspects, 
especially their recent release pending trial.  It is 
imperative that they be dealt with forcefully.  They need to 
be detained and vigorously prosecuted.  Allowing them to roam 
freely sends the wrong message to terrorists and others in 
the region fighting terrorism. 
 
-- (When the King raises rule of law concerns, and suggests 
that the case is in the hands of the courts): We fully 
understand rule of law concerns.  But within the rule of law, 
they must be prosecuted vigorously.  Failure to do so will 
have consequences for our otherwise very strong relationship. 
 
-- We recognize the noteworthy democratic steps the King has 
taken in recent years and value the King\'s personal 
participation in the G8 Sea Island summit.  We appreciate the 
positive leadership role being played by Bahrain in the Forum 
for the Future initiative and for the King\'s November 21 
pardon of activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja.  We hope that these 
very positive moves will not be undermined by possible steps 
backwards.  We urge you to revisit the decision to close the 
Bahrain Center for Human Rights and the government\'s proposed 
law that would apply new restrictions on Bahraini citizens\' 
ability to demonstrate. 
 
------------- 
Issues Briefs 
------------- 
 
Counter Terrorism and Security 
------------------------------ 
5.  (S) All of Bahrain\'s leaders are adamantly determined to 
maintain security for Americans in the Kingdom.  Whenever we 
make requests for extra security, the police respond 
immediately and appropriately.  The GOB has not shown the 
same determination, however, in cracking down on terrorism 
threats coming from within.  On November 1, the court 
released four Sunni Bahraini terrorism suspects after holding 
them since mid-July.  (Note:  The police subsequently 
re-detained one of the four, Yasser Kamal, on a separate 
charge of fleeing the court room during a September hearing. 
End Note.)  The GOB is currently keeping them under heavy 
surveillance. 
 
6.  (S) Despite repeated interventions from the Embassy and 
Washington, the GOB\'s performance in handling this case over 
the last six months continues to raise concerns about its 
commitment to successful prosecution of the suspects.  While 
the Bahrainis continually claim not to have sufficient 
evidence to convict the suspects, releasing them even before 
the trial begins sends the wrong message about Bahraini 
commitment to fighting terrorism.  The four will return to 
court on December 6 for a hearing on a defense motion 
contesting the constitutionality of the charges against them. 
 We should urge the King to take the suspects back into 
custody and prosecute the case aggressively and thoroughly. 
It is imperative that he hears this message from the 
President. 
 
Human Rights and Civil Liberties 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Bahrain\'s trend line on commitment to political and 
economic reform is strongly positive, but there inevitably 
are ups and downs.  In late September the government arrested 
human rights activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja following his 
comments at a forum on poverty in which he reportedly accused 
the Prime Minister of mismanaging the economy during his 
30-plus years in office.  Days later, the government closed 
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, which organized the 
forum, accusing it of political activities that contravened 
the Societies Law and the Center\'s own charter.  After 
several court hearings and demonstrations, the court November 
21 found Al Khawaja guilty of insulting the regime and 
sentenced him to one year in prison.  Later that day, the 
King pardoned him and set him free.  We should recognize the 
King\'s positive gesture, and ask him to consider finding a 
way to re-open the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. 
 
8.  (C) In response to demonstrations in support of Al 
Khawaja, the GOB presented a draft law to parliament which 
would regulate citizens\' right to assemble.  The law would 
apply significant bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining 
permission to demonstrate, allowing the government to assert 
greater control over protests.  (Note:  During a recent 
meeting with the Ambassador, the Shura Council (appointed 
upper house of parliament) leadership requested information 
on U.S. laws related to assembly.  End Note.)  We should 
point out that implementing the law as it is currently 
drafted would be a step back on Bahrain\'s path toward greater 
freedoms and openness. 
 
FTA 
--- 
 
9.  (SBU) The United States and Bahrain signed a free trade 
agreement on September 14, marking a new level of commitment 
in our bilateral economic relationship.  Bahrain is the first 
country in the Gulf region to have an FTA with us, and joins 
Jordan and Morocco as the only Arab states with FTAs.  We 
hope to use the Bahrain FTA as a springboard to promote 
economic reform, openness, and transparency in the region, 
and as an important step in realizing the President\'s vision 
of a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013.  Bahrain will cite 
the FTA as the United States\' endorsement of its economy and 
to market Bahrain as a regional center for finance, 
insurance, banking, business services, education, and health 
care.  The King is most interested in expeditious 
congressional ratification of the FTA and will likely request 
the Administration\'s support. 
 
Iraq/Iran 
--------- 
 
10.  (C) Despite opposition in the parliament and the press, 
the King has been a strong supporter of our policy in Iraq. 
The Foreign Ministry told us that one aim of the King\'s visit 
is to remind Bahrainis and others in the Gulf that the U.S. 
is a great ally who liberated Kuwait and removed Saddam 
Hussein from power.  Bahrain has historically worried about 
the Iranian threat to Bahrain and the region, and supports a 
strong policy of containing Iran.

1.  (SBU) Ambassador November 20 delivered Ref A and B 
G8/BMENA talking points and agendas to Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar.  Abdul Ghaffar said 
that Minister of Finance and National Economy Abdulla Saif 
would attend the December 11 meetings in Rabat, but it was 
not yet clear whether Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed 
bin Mubarak Al Khalifa or Abdul Ghaffar himself would 
accompany Saif.  There was a chance Mohammed bin Mubarak 
would have to remain in Manama at the time of the Rabat 
meetings.  In this case, Abdul Ghaffar would lead the 
\"political\" side of the Bahraini delegation. 
 
2.  (SBU) In a meeting on November 22 with the visiting U.S. 
Secretary of the Navy Minister Saif confirmed to the 
 
SIPDIS 
Ambassador that he would attend the Rabat meeting and that 
his staff was currently working on two papers: one on the 
Entrepreneurship Center and the other on the Network of 
Funds.  During the meeting, Saif referred to his phone 
conversation the day before with Treasury Under Secretary 
Taylor, during which they discussed the Network of Funds 
initiative at length.  (Note: In a separate meeting with 
EconOff on November 22, Yousif Humoud, Director of Economic 
Planning at the Ministry of Finance, said he expected Saif to 
present the Network of Funds paper at the Finance Ministers\' 
break-out session.  Governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency 
(BMA) Sheikh Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa would also travel 
to Morocco to give the presentation on the Entrepreneurship 
Center, given the BMA\'s role in managing the Bahrain 
Institute for Banking and Finance, host to the new center. 
End Note) 
 
3.  (SBU) Abdul Ghaffar said that his government is concerned 
that momentum in the BMENA initiative could peter out under 
the British G8 presidency.  He is very appreciative of 
President Bush\'s leadership and hopes that Prime Minister 
Blair demonstrates the same commitment.  As a start, Blair 
could invite regional leaders to the next G8 summit.  Abdul 
Ghaffar said that the initiative was important to demonstrate 
that the G8 countries, and in particular the U.S., are 
friends doing positive things for the peoples of the region. 
 
4.  (SBU) Abdul Ghaffar stated that Bahrain would host the 
2005 Forum for the Future meeting.  The Ambassador responded 
that Secretary Powell had noted the Bahraini offer to host 
during his meeting with BMENA and G8 foreign ministers on the 
margins of the UNGA, but the issue appeared not to be settled 
yet.  Abdul Ghaffar replied that he had confirmed information 
that Bahrain would host the 2005 meeting, but this news was 
not yet public.

Classified By: Amb. William T. Monroe.   Reason: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: MFA Minister of State Abdul Ghaffar told 
Secretary of the Navy England November 22 that the King will 
 
SIPDIS 
use his upcoming visit to Washington to stress to the 
President that Bahrain is proudly aligned with the U.S., and 
to remind the people of Bahrain that the people of the Gulf 
owe a great debt to the U.S. for liberating Kuwait and 
overthrowing Saddam.  Secretary England stressed the 
continued importance of fighting terrorism, noting in 
particular our concern about the four terrorist suspects 
released on November 1.  Abdul Ghaffar said Bahrain is 
committed to fighting terrorism, but wants to do it in 
accordance with the Kingdom\'s legal system.  On Iraq, Abdul 
Ghaffar said that the upcoming elections were extremely 
important in giving more legitimacy to the Iraqi government, 
but advocated postponement if security and foreign influence 
could not be rolled back.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdul 
Ghaffar opened the November 22 meeting with Secretary of the 
Navy Gordon England by expressing Bahrain\'s gratitude for the 
King\'s November 29 visit to Washington and meetings with 
President Bush and other senior officials.  Bahrain 
recognized that it was a great privilege to visit so soon 
after the election.  The King will tell the President that he 
is coming as an ally and to discuss what can be done to 
develop closer cooperation. 
 
3.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar stated that the King will seek to 
reinforce with President Bush that Bahrain is proudly and 
unabashedly aligned with the United States.  At the same 
time, he wants to remind the Bahraini people that the nations 
of the Gulf owe a great debt to the U.S., which liberated 
Kuwait and removed Saddam Hussein.  While there may have been 
some mistakes in Iraq, the United States is a close friend 
and ally of Bahrain and the region. \"Very few people in the 
region are saying this these days,\" Abdul Ghaffar said.  \"We 
will say this in Washington.\"  When asked by the Ambassador 
if the King would say this publicly in Washington, Abdul 
Ghaffar said he did not want to get into details at this 
time, but reiterated that the King was determined to put 
forward this message during the visit. 
 
4.  (C) The SecNav expressed appreciation for this statement 
of support.  He stressed, at the same time, that fighting 
terrorism remained an important U.S. priority, and in that 
connection the terrorist suspects who were released by the 
court November 1 are of great concern to Washington 
officials.  This could be expected to be a topic in the 
King\'s meetings there.  Abdul Ghaffar said the GOB is 
committed to keeping all the country\'s residents safe from 
terrorism, especially Americans on the island.  He added that 
he hoped the terror suspects would be convicted in their 
trial, which begins December 6.  He assured the SecNav that 
the government would do everything possible to obtain the 
suspects\' conviction, but he emphasized that the separation 
of powers placed limits on what the government could do to 
influence the courts.  \"We want to fight terrorism,\" he said, 
\"but want to do it in a legal way.\"  He likened the situation 
to the disagreements between American courts and USG 
officials on Guantanamo.  He hoped the case of the six 
suspects would not negatively impact bilateral relations, as 
this would only benefit terrorists and those who seek to 
diminish the American role in Bahrain. 
 
5.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar stressed that the GOB is committed to 
fighting terrorism and is eager to improve its ability to do 
so.  He thanked the SecNav for the USG\'s ongoing assistance 
in this regard.  He noted that Minister of Interior Shaikh 
Rashed Al Khalifa wants to open more channels with U.S. 
agencies working on counter-terrorism.  He said that the GOB 
is interested in U.S. assistance to build a counter-terrorism 
operations center and to improve its technological means of 
fighting terrorism. 
 
6.  (C) Asked by the SecNav about Iraq, Abdul Ghaffar said 
that the upcoming elections were extremely important as a 
step forward in giving more legitimacy to the Iraqi 
government.  But there has to be some order in order to have 
successful elections.  Fallujah may need some time to heal. 
If violence and foreign influence cannot be rolled back in 
time, the elections should be delayed.  He said that he had 
met many Iraqis who told him about American-led 
reconstruction projects, and he was disappointed that the 
media only highlights the negatives.  He added that security 
in Iraq is vital to the security of the entire Gulf.  He said 
the King would present more ideas on Iraq during its visit to 
Washington.  Abdul Ghaffar noted that Iran would also be on 
the agenda. 
 
7.  (C) Abdul Ghaffar emphasized that the (DOD) Bahrain 
School is a fixture in American-Bahraini relations and urged 
the SecNav to keep it open.  England assured him that the USG 
would find a way to keep the school in operation.

six, but must also be concerned with terrorist cells that 
might remain hidden.  The Secretary replied that if the case 
of the six is not handled properly, terrorists might consider 
Bahrain a permissive environment in which to work.  Al 
Khalifa stated that the GOB did not want that to happen and 
said the six are still under surveillance.  He assured the

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN OFFERS TO HOST IRAQ FACTIONS MEETING 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.4 (b)(d) 
 
 1. (U) Bahrain Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammed Al Khalifa, 
speaking at the November 22-23 Sharm El Sheikh conference on 
Iraq, reported Bahrain\'s readiness to host a meeting of all 
factions in Iraq prior to the scheduled January 30 elections 
in order to encourage broad participation in the vote.  He 
noted that the King had first raised this idea in July 2003, 
when he expressed \"Bahrain\'s readiness to host a national 
conference for all Iraqi factions and political tendencies to 
contribute to the success of the elections in Iraq.\" 
 
2. (C) One day before Shaikh Mohammed\'s remarks, King Hamad 
told visiting Secretary of the Navy Gordon England that he 
had been thinking of inviting all political parties in Iraq 
to a conference in Bahrain.  Bahrain, he said, is neutral and 
has no interests in Iraq, so it could offer a useful venue 
for such a conference.  The idea behind the conference would 
be to help identify moderates from the Sunnis, Shia, and 
Kurds.  If the moderates get support, he said, they can 
maneuver into the government.  \"We want to embrace and 
support and embrace the moderates.\" 
 
3. (C) Attempts to develop more information or background on 
the proposal from the MFA yielded little.  The senior MFA 
official in town, Undersecretary Yousif Mohammed Mahmoud, 
simply reiterated to the Ambassador what Shaikh Mohammed said 
-- that this was an idea that had first been proposed in July 
2003.  The Iraqi Ambassador told the Ambassador that the 
proposal was a surprise to him, and to his Foreign Ministry. 
In checking with Baghdad, he was told that, as an initial 
reaction, his government supported the idea in principle, but 
believed that the meeting should be held in Iraq, not outside 
the country. 
 
4. (C) Comment. The King (and Shaikh Mohammed) will be in 
Washington on November 29 for meetings with the President and 
other senior USG officials.  To the extent that Washington 
finds the proposal potentially useful or wishes to explore it 
further, the visit offers an excellent opportunity to do so. 
 
5. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Secretary of the Navy Gordon England met with King 
Hamad and Crown Prince Salman November 23 and discussed the 
King\'s November 29 visit to Washington, Bahrain\'s 
counter-terrorism efforts, Iraq, and Iran.  The King 
expressed his appreciation for the invitation to meet with 
the President and other senior officials and looked forward 
to reinforcing that Bahrain is on the side of the United 
States.  Honorable people could not forget all the United 
States has done for the region.  The King said that Bahrain 
was going through a period of reform and the government was 
learning how to deal with civil laws and freedoms.  On Iraq, 
the King stated that there needed to be more troops on the 
ground to control Iranian and Syrian interference.  The Crown 
Prince asserted that Bahrain is rising to the challenge of 
combating terrorism.  The Secretary offered to assist in 
developing the capabilities of the Bahraini Coast Guard.  The 
CP advocated for continued DOD support for the Bahrain 
School.  He recommended that the United States contain the 
Iranian threat rather than attacking it directly. 
 
------------------------------ 
King:  Bahrain on Side of U.S. 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) King Hamad told Secretary England that he was very 
appreciative of the invitation to visit Washington November 
29.  He said that he wanted to personally congratulate the 
President on his reelection and to reinforce that Bahrain is 
on the side of the United States.  He stated that honorable 
people cannot forget what the United States has done for 
Kuwait and all the region, and everyone should know this. 
The Secretary noted that this would be a welcome message in 
Washington. 
 
3.  (C) The King recognized that Bahrain is going through a 
period of reform.  In the past, the government could rely 
upon the state security law.  The King got rid of that law, 
and now the government must learn how to deal with civil laws 
and freedoms.  This is a new way.  In Bahrain, people can 
march in the thousands and not create any problems.  The 
government permits them to do this, but will intervene if 
they start attacking or burning. 
 
----------------------------- 
More Troops on Ground in Iraq 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Turning to Iraq, the King expressed his belief that 
there needs to be more troops on the ground.  He worried that 
neighboring countries, in particular Iran and Syria, were 
trying to influence the status quo and the outcome of the 
elections.  He suggested further tightening of controls on 
access to/from these countries.  The King said that we should 
not \"get stuck\" in Iraq. 
 
5.  (C) The King warned that Iran would play games with the 
international community in pursuing its nuclear program. 
Iran would stop work when inspectors were in the country, 
then move forward after they departed, like India and North 
Korea had done.  He urged the United States to continue to 
warn Iran about the dangers of pursuing a nuclear program. 
 
--------------------------------- 
CP:  Committed To Fighting Terror 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Crown Prince Salman opened his meeting with the 
Secretary by stating that Bahrain wants to strengthen the 
 
SIPDIS 
bilateral relationship with the United States.  He said he is 
aware DOD is conducting a global defense posture review and 
emphasized that Bahrain is ready to assist the United States 
into the future and seeks to ensure that the Fifth Fleet is 
well served in the Kingdom.  The Secretary replied that 
security is always important, and the issue of the six 
terrorism suspects is prominent in Washington.  It would be 
raised during King Hamad\'s meetings November 29 in 
Washington.  His visit represents an opportunity to reassure 
senior U.S. officials that the GOB is totally committed to 
fighting terrorism and ensuring the security situation on the 
ground. 
 
7.  (C) The Crown Prince replied that Bahrain is completely 
committed to fighting terrorism. Bahrain is a small place and 
Bahrainis and Americans live, work, and shop together.  He 
asserted that terrorism is alien to Bahrain, and if there 
were an attack, it would harm Bahrainis, Americans, and other 
residents.  He said, \"We\'re rising to the challenge\" of 
combating terrorism.\"  The Secretary offered to help in any 
way, including working with Bahrain\'s Coast Guard.  The CP 
said that the island was easily defensible with the right 
strategy, technology, and training. 
 
8.  (C) The Crown Prince stated that the (DOD) Bahrain School 
was an excellent ambassador for the United States in Bahrain 
and urged the Secretary to find a way to maintain the DOD 
link.  The Secretary said it is a \"magnificent place\" and 
pledged to keep it open.  The CP said he was prepared to do 
whatever it takes to keep the school going.  The Secretary 
recognized the mutual benefits and mutual friendships that 
developed as a result of the school. 
 
----------------------------------- 
\"Win War, Not Just Battles\" In Iraq 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) With regard to Iraq, the Crown Prince said that 
security inside the country is getting better, but the United 
States must \"win the war, not just the battles.\"  He said 
that the U.S. has to overcome the ideas of the extremists, 
including Al Qaeda.  He asserted that \"we should set the 
agenda, not the terrorists.\"  He stated his belief that more 
troops - American, Iraqi, or international - were necessary 
to control security in the country, particularly in the run 
up to elections. 
 
10.  (C) The Crown Prince warned that Iran is trying to 
develop WMD and needed to be watched and contained.  A direct 
attack on Iran, he believes, would harm U.S. and Bahraini 
interests, possibly leading to instability in Bahrain, the 
eastern province of Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.  Containment was 
the appropriate way to deal with the threat. 
 
11. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

SUBJECT: BAHRAIN: POST SUPPORT FOR MEPI PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS 
 
REF: STATE 238836 
 
1. (U) Post appreciates this opportunity to provide feedback 
on our experiences working with MEPI implementers.  For the 
most part our experience has been positive, however, we would 
like to see better coordination on implementer travel 
including advance notice and contact information for those 
arranging logistics.  Embassy Manama would also like to be 
better integrated into the process of selecting MEPI projects 
for approval, to include regular updates of what topics are 
discussed at inter-agency pillar specific meetings in 
Washington.  As an example, we particularly appreciate the 
timeline of trade-related assistance provided by 
MEPI-Washington and suggest one be done for each pillar and 
be distributed to posts regularly.  We look forward to 
working with the MEPI regional office in Abu Dhabi on these 
kinds of issues.  Many of the challenges Embassy Manama faces 
in implementing MEPI programs are due to restrictions placed 
on the operation of both local and international NGOs by the 
GOB.  Comments are keyed to questions in para 4 of Reftel. 
 
----------------------------- 
Registration of Local Offices 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) At present there are two MEPI-funded implementers that 
have established offices in Bahrain, the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) and the American Bar Association (ABA).  In 
the coming year we hope to have a resident representative 
from Junior Achievement and expect a representative from the 
Beyster Institute to head the BMENA entrepreneurship center 
for its first year.  There are no MEPI-funded implementers in 
Bahrain under existing USAID or other bilateral agreements. 
 
3. (U) Without a GOB mechanism for registering international 
NGOs, representatives from NDI and the ABA operate in Bahrain 
without being officially registered.  In addition, the ban on 
the funding of any local NGO by a foreign government or 
international NGO further limits implementation.  Both NDI 
and the ABA have developed unique mechanisms to cope with GOB 
restrictions, and we expect that post will have to work 
closely with the GOB and future MEPI implementers seeking to 
establish offices in the country to ensure they are able to 
operate effectively. 
 
4. (U) NDI partners with local NGOs implementing its 
programs.  NDI was originally in Bahrain at the behest and 
with the permission of the King\'s Court.  NDI was later 
requested to register with the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs (MOLSA). However, after a period of negotiation it 
became clear that NDI would be not be able to register with 
MOLSA as a local association and has begun to negotiate a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  The MOU remains under review and until 
finalized NDI has been asked to refrain from scheduling any 
new activities.  However, projects already underway are being 
implemented. 
 
5. (U) The ABA, here at the behest and with the permission of 
the Minister of Justice, works within the Minister\'s office 
and keeps a low profile in order to avoid a request to 
register similar to that faced by NDI.  In order to operate, 
the ABA also spent a considerable amount of time negotiating 
an MOU with the MOJ. 
 
-------------------- 
Significant Barriers 
-------------------- 
 
6. (U) Expat staff of MEPI implementers in Bahrain must 
qualify for an identity card.  With an identity card an 
individual can rent housing and office space, get a phone and 
establish a bank account.  In the past we have found that 
MEPI implementers, while not prohibited from obtaining an 
identity card, do face significant red tape.  We understand 
that NDI has purchased liability coverage, but are not aware 
of any requirement that they do so. 
 
----- 
Costs 
----- 
 
7. (U) Post is not aware of local MEPI implementers being 
forced to pay higher costs than those imposed on local 
organizations.  Bahrain is a tax-free environment and fees 
(municipal fees or commercial registration fees) tend to be 
minimal. 
 
--------------- 
Security Issues 
--------------- 
 
8. (U) While visiting and locally resident MEPI implementers 
have expressed concern about the security situation in 
Bahrain, particularly after post went to authorized departure 
last summer, to date the RSO has nor received specific 
inquiries from implementers. 
 
----------------------- 
Use of Embassy Services 
----------------------- 
 
9. (U) To date there has been no request for commissary 
access or accommodation exchange. 
 
----------------- 
Misrepresentation 
----------------- 
 
10. (U) To our knowledge none of the MEPI implementers have 
presented themselves to the GOB as anything other than MEPI 
grantees.

SUBJECT: GCC COMPLAINS US-BAHRAIN FTA BREAKS THE RULES 
 
 
Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Susan L. Ziadeh for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  A November 23 Reuters article generated a 
flurry of responses in the Bahraini press including 
front-page coverage of comments by the Prime Minister. The 
article quoted an unnamed Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
official who said GCC member states believed the U.S.-Bahrain 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) violated Bahrain,s regional 
commitments.  We expect that this issue will be raised at the 
upcoming GCC ministerial conference to be held in Bahrain in 
early December, but understand that the GOB is not concerned 
they have upset the apple cart.  We believe Bahrain is 
counting on continued regional interest in following 
Bahrain\'s lead and that the GOB may pursue bilateral 
engagement with the most likely source of these comments, 
Saudi Arabia.  End Summary 
 
2. (U) The November 23 Reuters article quoted an anonymous 
GCC official who said that member states, particularly Saudi 
Arabia, were \"perturbed\" at Bahrain,s violation of regional 
commitments.  The article cited Saudi concerns that duty-free 
U.S. goods would flood its market via the Bahrain causeway. 
The GCC official added that all member states, including 
Bahrain, remained committed to collective rather than 
bilateral negotiations, but that the FTA was a reward for 
Bahrain, which had succumbed to significant \"political 
pressure\" from the U.S.  The Reuters article also quotes 
Yousif Humoud, Director of Economic Planning at the Ministry 
of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE), who denies Bahrain 
is under any pressure from its regional partners. 
 
3. (U) In a November 29 article in the English-language 
Bahrain Tribune covering statements made by Prime Minister 
Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa at his majlis the day 
before, the Prime Minister stressed that other GCC states had 
entered into bilateral agreements in the past without similar 
objections.  He also reaffirmed that a preferential trade 
relationship with the U.S. was well within Bahrain,s rights. 
 
4. (C) In a follow-up conversation, with EmbOff, Humoud noted 
that Bahrain had closely consulted with its GCC partners 
throughout the negotiation.  He said the dissatisfaction 
reported in the article was not something the GOB was getting 
through official channels.  Humoud also believes the 
announcement on November 15 that two other GCC members, the 
UAE and Oman, would enter into FTA negotiations with the U.S. 
was evidence that the complaints were not serious.  Humoud 
reaffirmed that the FTA was consistent with GCC commitments 
on preferential treatment.  He noted that GCC states can 
not/not give any country with which they have a bilateral 
agreement any preference that exceeds the preference granted 
to GCC member states.  According to Humoud, in this case the 
privileges granted are the same and therefore within the 
bounds of Bahrain,s GCC commitments. 
 
5. (C) A November 25 article in the Arabic Al-Ayam newspaper, 
in which we believe the anonymous source quoted is Humoud, 
cites an agreement reached in the GCC Financial and Economic 
Affairs Committee on December 14, 2002 that stipulates that 
tariffs on goods imported into any GCC state, which may be 
exempt from duty based on a bilateral trade agreement, can be 
levied at the border of the GCC state into which they are 
re-imported.  Therefore although U.S. goods are cheaper in 
Bahrain, their import via Bahrain will not effectively reduce 
any tariffs another GCC state may choose to levy on U.S. 
goods. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  It is our sense that the GOB, although eager 
to lay down a marker in the press before the agreement goes 
before Parliament, believes there is little substance to 
these claims.  Embassy Manama understands that King Hamad 
raised this issue in his meeting with Secretary Powell, and 
that he sees the FTA as purely a bilateral issue with the 
U.S.  Comments from MOFNE staff affirm that Bahrain sees no 
conflict between the FTA and ongoing liberalization within 
the GCC.  End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) A draft law on the regulation of public gatherings 
is drawing intense criticism from civil society and members 
of parliament alike.  The proposed legislation establishes 
new regulations and bureaucratic hurdles for those seeking to 
organize public gatherings.  Opponents of the measure say it 
is unconstitutional and represents a reversal of the GOB\'s 
reforms in recent years.  Interior Minister Shaikh Rashid bin 
Abdullah Al Khalifa said the proposed law is necessary to 
protect property, prevent roadblocks, and keep \"derogatory 
slogans\" out of demonstrations.  Shia Bahrainis, who are more 
likely than Sunnis to demonstrate, view the draft law as 
specifically targeting them.  Parliament is expected to 
debate the draft law in the coming weeks.  Numerous 
parliamentarians have stressed they would not pass any law 
that unjustly restricts freedom of expression or assembly. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) The GOB presented the draft law governing 
demonstrations just days after the October 28 \"car parade\" in 
support of human rights activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja that 
tied up traffic in Manama for hours.  Some 25 people were 
arrested.  The following two nights unidentified youth 
attacked police vehicles and burned tires in two Shia areas 
of the island (Ref B).  The Interior Minister said the 
measures in the proposed law are necessary to keep protests 
free from property damage, roadblocks, and \"derogatory 
slogans.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
Provisions of the Draft Law 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Under current laws, organizers of a public 
gathering (defined as any meeting that occurs in a public or 
private place which does not require an invitation to attend) 
simply notify the local police station of the event.  The 
proposed legislation, which the government submitted to 
parliament October 27, requires organizers to apply for 
permission from the governor of the location where the event 
will take place, and for the organizers to be residents of 
that governorate.  Hence, anyone organizing a demonstration 
in front of parliament must be from the Capital governorate. 
Marches that move from one governorate to another require 
both governors\' and the Interior Ministry\'s approval.  All 
printed, video or audio materials that will be distributed 
must be authorized by the governor. 
 
4.  (SBU) At least three of the organizers must serve on a 
committee held responsible for demonstration participants who 
break the law.  Anyone who organizes a public gathering 
without permission faces up to two years in prison, a fine of 
up to BD1000 ($2650), or both.  The draft law allows 
governors to delay ruling on an event until two days before 
the event commences.  (Note: Critics argue that this would 
not give sufficient time to properly advertise gatherings. 
End Note.)  The sentence for participating in an unlicensed 
demonstration is up to six months in prison, a BD500 ($1330) 
fine, or both.  Under the draft law, only Bahraini citizens 
can participate in political protests. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Negative Reactions and Commitments to Amend the Draft 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Human rights activists have expressed concern about 
the discretionary power given to governors under the proposed 
law and say that existing laws sufficiently regulate public 
gatherings.  National Democratic Action Society board member 
Ebrahim Alsayed and Nabeel Rajab of the dissolved Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights have stated publicly that if the law 
were passed in its current form, activists would \"test this 
law quickly\" by holding unauthorized demonstrations and would 
\"make sure the prisons are full of people who break this 
law.\"  Members of both the Shura Council and the Nuwab have 
openly vowed that they will approve the draft law only if it 
is amended to ensure that the constitutional right to 
assemble is protected.  37 NGOs and political societies 
(organized by the opposition group Al Wifaq) drafted a 
petition rejecting the law and announced plans to propose an 
alternative law.  The Nuwab issued a statement warning that 
the Constitution prohibits anyone outside of the cabinet and 
parliament from drafting and proposing legislation. 
 
6.  (SBU) According to the Ministry of Interior, the draft 
law would not affect gatherings that are purely religious, 
arranged by a government body, or called by official clubs or 
societies to discuss internal matters (as long as only 
members attend).  However, many fear that under the proposed 
law governors could easily restrict Shia religious 
processions, which have always been a contentious issue. 
Many are also concerned that the proposed law would prove to 
be a large headache for the hundreds of Bahrainis who hold 
frequent and informal majlises (discussion sessions) in their 
homes.  The Undersecretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 
cognizant of the widespread dissatisfaction with the proposed 
law, met with the Nuwab Foreign Affairs, Defense, and 
National Security Committee November 28.  Members of 
parliament who participated were positive about the prospects 
for amending the draft law to achieve a more desirable piece 
of legislation. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Though the draft law has sparked much debate, there 
seems to be a willingness among relevant parties to find a 
solution.  Numerous members of parliament stressed that they 
would not pass any law that unjustly restricts freedom of 
expression or assembly.  This issue is also viewed through a 
sectarian prism: Shia Bahrainis tend to demonstrate far more 
often than Sunnis (Ref A), and so many view the draft law as 
specifically targeting them. 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment continued:  The Ambassador met recently 
with the Shura Council leadership, which asked him for 
guidance on how the U.S. handles laws governing 
demonstrations.  We passed to them information gathered by 
the American Bar Association, which has a MEPI-funded rule of 
law project in Bahrain.

Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.4 (b)(d) 
 
 1. (C) Summary. Saudi FM Prince Saud, speaking at a 
conference in Bahrain December 5, criticized bilateral 
security and economic agreements between GCC countries and 
international powers.  Bahrain quickly reacted publicly and 
privately.  Publicly, it issued a statement defending its 
signing of the FTA with the U.S. as in full accord with GCC 
commitments.  Privately, the Crown Prince summoned the U.S. 
and British Ambassadors to register concern, and the King is 
set to travel to Saudi Arabia December 7 to raise the issue 
personally with CP Abdullah.  The Bahrainis are concerned 
about an apparent Saudi effort to ratchet up pressure on 
them, but have also made it clear this will not impact on 
their enthusiasm for the FTA.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Crown Prince Shaykh Salman Al-Khalifa summoned the 
American and British Ambassadors December 6 to register 
Bahrain\'s concern about remarks delivered the day before in 
Bahrain at the concluding session of the IISS-sponsored \"Gulf 
Dialogue\" conference by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al 
Faisal criticizing GCC countries who enter into bilateral 
agreements with international powers. 
 
3. (U) In his speech, entitled \"Towards a New Framework for 
Regional Security,\" Prince Saud called for a new framework 
based on three interdependent components: sub-national, 
regional, and international.  At the sub-national level, 
Prince Saud recognized the need for meaningful political, 
economic, social, and educational reforms, but said they 
needed to be prioritized and designed on a country-by-country 
basis.  On the regional level, he said that security of the 
GCC countries will depend on collective efforts, stating: 
 
\"It is thus alarming to see some members of the GCC enter 
into separate bilateral agreements with international powers, 
on both security and economic spheres, as precedence over the 
need to act collectively.  These separate arrangements are 
not compatible with the spirit of the Charter of the GCC. 
They diminish the collective bargaining power and weaken not 
only the solidarity of the GCC as a whole, but also each of 
its members in both the immediate and long terms.  In the 
economic sphere, the agreements entered into are in clear 
violation of the GCC\'s economic accords and decisions.  What 
is more important, these agreements shall impede the 
progressive steps needed to achieve full Gulf economic 
integration....\"  (Full text of speech faxed to NEA/ARPI.) 
 
4. (C) Coming on the heels of press reports citing an unnamed 
official from a GCC country saying the U.S.-Bahrain FTA 
violated the GCC charter (ref a), Bahraini officials felt 
they were a particular target of this statement (although 
Shaykh Salman said the Kuwaitis \"were jumping up and down\" 
after the speech).  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Mohammed promptly issued a statement to the 
press defending the FTA, saying that it was consistent with 
its GCC commitments and that \"there is nothing that violates 
the agreements.\" 
 
5. (C) In his meeting with the U.S. and British Ambassadors, 
CP Shaykh Salman said the King had been briefed on the speech 
upon his return to Bahrain the night before and instructed 
the CP to pass on his concerns to the two Ambassadors. 
Shaykh Salman said there is a danger for all of us if Saudi 
Arabia starts throwing its weight around.  This is something 
that needs to be managed, he said, and wondered if Washington 
or London had a position on this.  The Saudi position is not 
rational, he said, and if it becomes an issue at the upcoming 
GCC Summit, it could be a problem.  He added that Bahrain 
does recognize that Saudi Arabia is the most important 
country in the region, and that Bahrain will of course stand 
firm with the Saudis as they go through this \"hissy fit.\" 
 
6. (C) The Crown Prince said that it was Bahrain\'s impression 
that Prince Saud was uncomfortable delivering a message that 
was dictated to him from above.  Before actually giving his 
speech, he shared the text with the Bahrainis, saying that he 
tried to tone down the message as much as he could.  The 
Crown Prince said that King Hamad will travel to Saudi Arabia 
on December 7 to meet with CP Abdullah and tell him that this 
statement was not helpful and was detrimental not only to 
Bahrain and other GCC countries, but also the U.S.   He will 
say that GCC countries need to work as partners with 
countries outside the region.  If Bahrain can\'t sign an 
agreement such as an FTA with the U.S., the CP asked, who can 
it sign such an agreement with?   Djibouti?  How will that 
help?  And what do the Saudis want Bahrain to do?  Withdraw 
from the Free Trade Agreement? 
 
7. (C) The Crown Prince reiterated concerns he and the King 
had made to Deputy Secretary Armitage last month about recent 
actions by the Saudis against Bahrain, including a cut-off in 
sales of sand (essential for the cement industry), and a 
failure to restore 50,000 b/d of oil that had previously been 
given to Bahrain (ref b).  He said that the King would raise 
the oil issue in his meeting with CP Abdullah. 
 
8. (C) Separately, just after Prince Saud\'s speech, UAE MFA 
Undersecretary Abdullah bin Rashid Al-Nuaymi told NSC PG 
Director Theroux that Saudi Arabia is \"squeezing\" Bahrain, 
cutting aid (both financial and oil).  \"Please do something,\" 
he said, \"This is bad.\"  He added that he was mentioning this 
as a personal comment, and not as an official message. 
 
9. (C) Comment: Bahrainis have made it clear, both publicly 
and privately, that Saudi pressure will not impact on their 
enthusiasm for the FTA, which they see as strongly in their 
national interest.  Nonetheless, there is clear concern that 
the Saudis are ratcheting up pressure on them.  Given 
Bahrain\'s economic dependence on Saudi Arabia, it will most 
certainly want to stress resolution, rather than 
confrontation, with the Saudis on this issue. 
 
10. (U) Baghdad minimize concern.

SUBJECT: CODEL HAGEL MEETS WITH CROWN PRINCE AT GULF 
DIALOGUE CONFERENCE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Bahrain\'s Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin 
Hamad Al Khalifa met with Senators Chuck Hagel, Dianne 
Feinstein and Lincoln Chafee and their staff on December 4 on 
the margins of the \"Gulf Dialogue,\" an international 
conference sponsored by the GOB and organized by the 
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies 
(IISS).  The Codel raised concerns about the future of Iraq, 
the peace process and the importance of the two upcoming 
elections in the region.  The CP underscored the importance 
of continued U.S. engagement in the region and Bahrain,s 
commitment to supporting democratic development in both Iraq 
and for the Palestinian people. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The CP opened the meeting by thanking the Senators for 
their continued support for Bahrain.  He said he thought it 
important to first recognize the burden the U.S. carries in 
the region.  Bahrain is grateful for the significant 
sacrifices the U.S. has made for the region,s benefit. 
Senator Hagel praised Bahrain,s leadership on regional 
issues, its own reform efforts and noted the long-standing 
warm relations with the U.S.  He thanked Bahrain for its 
support of the Gulf Dialogue.  The off-the-record Gulf 
Dialogue brought together the national security leadership of 
Gulf Cooperation Council states along with its neighbors 
(notably Iraq) and key allies including the U.S., the UK and 
France.  Having the Gulf Dialogue in Manama was a natural 
fit, playing to Bahrain,s strengths.  He said it was the 
lack of strategic alliances in the region and the need to 
build those kinds of relationships that led to his support 
for IISS efforts to organize such a conference and the 
Codel,s participation. 
 
3. (C) Turning to the comments made by the CP earlier that 
morning, Hagel asked what Bahrain expected would happen after 
elections in Iraq.  The CP noted Bahrain,s own concerns 
about Saddam,s Iraq.  However, he admitted the GOB did not 
support the war at the outset.  Despite growing insecurity 
before the elections, Bahrain sees the U.S. presence in Iraq 
as ultimately a stabilizing factor in the region.  Once held, 
the elections will help to establish the legitimate 
institutions that regional governments will be able to work 
with.  The principal concern Bahrain now has is who will win 
the elections and whether those new institutions will be 
friendly to the U.S. or will more radical elements take hold. 
 He added that despite the short-term need to plus-up troop 
numbers, he believed foreign troops should eventually be 
replaced by regional peacekeepers. 
 
4. (C) Senator Feinstein raised the Palestinian elections, 
noted the need to take advantage of this historic opportunity 
for peace, and called on the CP to support Abu Mazen. 
Feinstein urged Gulf state leaders to speak out on the need 
for a two-state solution in Palestine in order to ostracize 
extremists on both sides and bring the Arab media on board. 
The CP said that Bahrain understood that the death of Arafat, 
a man he did not respect, was an opening.  Yet, while there 
is an opportunity to do things a new way, the key remained 
the same: the U.S. must be more effective in winning hearts 
and minds in the region.  Therefore the U.S. must, even if 
politically difficult, engage in a public discourse that 
demonstrates that the goal of promoting democracy in the 
Middle East includes Palestinians as well.  At the same time, 
he said, we in the region need to hold the Palestinians 
accountable for their actions.  He feared that the U.S. would 
blame any new Palestinian leadership for individual acts of 
violence he believed inevitable.  Foreign Minister Sheikh 
Mohammed bin Mubarak al Khalifa added that the most pressing 
concern for the GOB was the current leadership vacuum and 
support for Abu Mazen was secondary to successful elections. 
On Iraq, Senator Feinstein urged Bahrain to convey the 
message to the Iraqi leadership that Sunnis must be included 
in Iraq,s future or the violence will continue. 
 
5. (C) Senator Chafee noted that a common refrain was echoed 
in the conference: that U.S. interests in the Middle East are 
guided only by a desire to steal the region,s oil.  He asked 
for the CP,s views on how U.S. consumption of oil promotes 
those stereotypes and whether the U.S. is rightly vulnerable 
to that accusation.  The CP said he believed that the market 
itself, as it adapted to new realities, would help to correct 
that view.  First and most importantly, growing economies 
like China and India will soon outpace U.S. consumption. 
Second, the current rise in the price of oil, which many 
wrongly see as the region,s salvation, is due not only to 
increased consumption but inefficiencies in the refining 
process.  Once these inefficiencies are corrected and the 
price drops, then the argument that the U.S. seeks to rob the 
region of its oil becomes less persuasive.

SUBJECT: CROWN PRINCE TO PROPOSE CONTROVERSIAL DRAFT LABOR 
LAW IN COMING MONTHS 
 
REF: MANAMA 1489 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for Reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) In a meeting with the Ambassador and Embassy Baghdad 
Political-Military Counselor and former Ambassador to Bahrain 
Ronald Neumann, Crown Prince Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa said he 
would submit a draft labor law to the Cabinet by late January 
or early February.  He hoped the parliament would approve the 
law before concluding its annual session in May.  The 
proposed law imposes employer paid entry fees 
(BD6000/USD16,000) and monthly fees (BD10/USD27) for 
expatriate workers, a recommendation endorsed by the recent 
McKinsey and Company report on the Bahraini economy (reftel). 
 Fees collected would go into an account to train Bahraini 
workers and pay for various public works projects.  The Crown 
Prince insisted that household help (70,000 of the 220,000 
workers in Bahrain) be included to prevent employers from 
exploiting the distinction and hiring laborers without paying 
tariffs. 
 
2.  (C) The Crown Prince reported that a November 23 
conference to discuss labor law reform brought together 150 
people from various sectors of society.  Participants\' 
biggest concern was that the proposed reforms would be 
impossible to implement.  The Crown Prince stressed that 
reforms would be implemented gradually to mitigate potential 
shocks to the economy.  He acknowledged that the draft law 
would be controversial.  He stated that opposition group Al 
Wifaq and labor unions like it, but business does not.  The 
Crown Prince noted that the private sector would be more 
agreeable to the tariffs if it could have at least partial 
control of the account for worker training programs.  He also 
acknowledged a need to gain active support of the cabinet 
ministers, who to date have not helped lobby for the reforms. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: The Crown Prince correctly characterizes the 
labor reform program as controversial.  Debate of the draft 
law in the cabinet and parliament will likely be intensive 
and could result in substantial modification of the law. 
Although the Crown Prince talks optimistically of getting the 
active support of cabinet ministers, others warn that 
opposition by the Prime Minister and his key allies in the 
cabinet will make passage difficult.

SUBJECT: GCC CRISIS? MINISTERIAL FOUNDERS ON BAHRAIN FTA 
ISSUE 
 
REF: MANAMA 1814 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.4 (B)(D) 
 
 1. (C) The December 7 meeting of GCC Ministers of Foreign 
Affairs and Finance, aimed at preparing for the 25th GCC 
Summit in Manama December 20-21, ended in failure over Saudi 
insistence that all discussions of FTAs with the United 
States stop, Deputy Foreign Minister and Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Shaykh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa told the 
Ambassador December 8.  His account paralleled what Kuwait 
Foreign Minister Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah told an embassy source 
before departing back to Kuwait today. 
 
2. (C) According to Shaykh Mohammed, the Saudis at the 
Ministerial insisted that bilateral discussions with the 
United States on FTAs stop until there is first agreement 
among the GCC countries.  If this movement on FTAs is not 
stopped, they said, Saudi Arabia would withdraw from the GCC 
Customs Union.  The FTA issue was the first item on the 
agenda.  Shaykh Mohammed said that when he tried to move the 
discussion on to other issues, such as Iraq or Iran, the 
Saudis declined.  The FTA issue was left on the table 
unresolved, with delegations agreeing to consult in their 
capitals.  GCC Foreign and Finance Ministers will depart for 
Rabat this weekend for the December 11 Forum for the Future 
meeting.  Shaykh Mohammed expected to have further bilateral 
discussions on the issue while in Rabat.  The King\'s position 
on this is clear, he said.  If the FTA issue is not removed 
from the agenda, he will cancel the Summit.  Shaykh Mohammed 
said he would not call it a deadlock at this time, but he did 
term it a crisis. 
 
3. (C) King Hamad had traveled to Riyadh December 7 to 
discuss the issue with King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah 
(reftel), but Shaykh Mohammed said that the King was unable 
to raise the issue during his meetings with them.  Kuwait\'s 
Dr. Mohammed said he was told that, when the King raised it, 
his Saudi interlocutors declined to enter into a discussion, 
saying there were too many people in the room. 
 
4. (C) Shaykh Mohammed said that the King\'s position on the 
FTA with the U.S. remains firm: Bahrain has signed it, and it 
will respect its signature.  He noted that the EU has been 
negotiating unsuccessfully for 15 years to get a free trade 
agreement with the GCC, and Bahrain will not sacrifice its 
interests to wait for a common GCC position (in other words, 
when the Saudis are ready). 
 
5. (C) Comment.  The Bahrainis are perplexed by the sudden 
Saudi hardline on the FTA, which has long been well-known to 
the Saudis.  Shaykh Mohammed said that the Saudis had raised 
a general concern in multilateral fora from time to time, but 
never bilaterally.  Finance Minister Abdullah Seif suggested 
to the Ambassador that perhaps the Saudis only became 
concerned when they recognized that other GCC countries were 
starting to follow Bahrain\'s lead and negotiate their own 
bilateral FTAs.  He wondered what could be done to help move 
the Saudis forward on WTO and FTAs.  Other observers have 
speculated that the real target of the Saudis is the U.S.; 
the Saudis are alarmed that the U.S. influence among the 
other GCC countries is growing at Saudi expense, and Bahrain 
is the softest and easiest country on which Saudi Arabia can 
exercise its leverage.  Clearly, it is in our interest to 
support Bahrain and other GCC countries who wish to negotiate 
FTAs with the U.S.  This issue will no doubt come up on the 
margins of the Forum for the Future meeting, and GCC 
countries (especially Bahrain) will be seeking U.S. reaction.

SUBJECT: TERROR SUSPECT CASE REFERRED TO CONSTITUTIONAL 
COURT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.4 (B)(D) 
 
1. (U) The High Criminal Court judge hearing the case of four 
Bahrain terrorist suspects adjourned their criminal trial for 
two weeks on December 6 to allow defense lawyers to test the 
constitutionality of the case with the Constitutional Court. 
The lawyers argued in court that the article under which the 
suspects are being tried (Article 157 - conspiracy to commit 
a crime) is unconstitutional.  The judge scheduled the next 
hearing for December 20.  If at that point the defense 
lawyers bring documentation that they have filed the case 
with the Constitutional Court, the judge said he will suspend 
the hearing in his court and wait for the result of the 
Constitutional Court. 
 
2. (SBU) Constitutional Court Secretary General Fathi Kemichi 
told the Ambassador he fully expected the Constitutional 
Court to accept the case.  How long it will take the 
Constitutional Court to consider the case is uncertain.  The 
court was established only recently, has heard only one case 
so far, and does not have a track record.  Kemichi said that 
it currently has five cases waiting to be heard.  He could 
not predict how quickly the court will get to this case, but 
indicated it could be a couple of months or more. 
 
3. (U) According to press reports, during the December 6 
hearing the defendants complained that there were being kept 
under heavy surveillance.  One of the defense lawyers asked 
the judge to stop this \"harassment\" of the defendants, which 
he said amounted to psychological pressure.  The judge 
declined to act, saying his authority is limited to the court 
and that he has no authority over what the security forces 
are doing. 
 
4. (U) Separately, one of the defense lawyers confirmed to us 
that the six-month sentence for one of the defendants, Yassir 
Kemal, who was convicted for fleeing the courthouse during a 
hearing in November, began from the time of his sentencing in 
mid-November.  He thus should remain in prison until May for 
this offense. 
 
4. (C) Comment: While it is disappointing that the case has 
not yet proceeded to trial, it was no surprise that it moved 
on to the Constitutional Court.  At a time when Bahraini 
leadership has been signaling their concern about the lack of 
evidence and the need to adhere to the rule of law, 
transferring the case to the Constitutional Court at least 
has the effect of dragging out the period during which the 
cloud of legal proceedings -- and surveillance -- hangs over 
the head of the defendants.  And perhaps the worst of the 
group, Yassir Kemal, will remain in jail for at last another 
five months.

1. (U) SUMMARY:  The inaugural meeting of the MENA FATF held 
on November 29 and 30 in Manama, Bahrain was attended by 
Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors from fourteen 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa.  The ministers 
selected a President, Vice President and Executive Secretary, 
but postponed action on the work program until the first 
Plenary in March 2005.  In discussing the MOU, a conflict 
over decision-making was resolved by increasing the size of a 
quorum to three quarters and requiring consensus of those in 
attendance at a Plenary for a decision.  The US delegation 
led by Treasury A/S Zarate held bilateral meetings with 11 
countries during the conference.  Zarate also met with 
Bahraini Minister of Finance and National Economy Saif who 
discussed the establishment, in Bahrain, of a special court 
to try financial crimes cases.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) On November 29 and 30, in Manama, Bahrain, ministerial 
delegations from fourteen Middle East and North Africa 
nations attended the inaugural meeting of the Middle East and 
North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENA FATF). (Note: 
FATF is an international body that sets standards and 
promotes best practices on anti-money laundering and 
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) issues.  End 
note) The meeting was attended by the Minister of Finance 
and/or Central Bank Governor from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, 
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, 
Syria, Tunisia, UAE, and Yemen. There were also observer 
delegations from Iraq, France, the GCC, the UK, IMF, World 
Bank, FATF, and a US delegation headed by Assistant Secretary 
of the Treasury, Juan Zarate.  The US Delegation had 
representatives from Treasury, OFAC, FinCEN, FBI, State EB 
and INL, and Embassy Baghdad. 
 
3. (U) The first day of the conference was a technical 
session during which attendees quickly agreed on the 
President, Vice President, and Executive Secretariat. 
However, there was intense debate on the MOU over how 
decisions for the body would be made.  The discussion hinged 
on the word for \"consensus\" in the Arabic translation of the 
MOU that some parties argued be interpreted as \"unanimous.\" 
The USG delegation was concerned that with this 
interpretation any party could passively block an initiative 
by not acting and thereby deny unanimity.  After some 
wrangling, the group eventually agreed to a \"consensus of all 
members attending the Plenary Meeting\" and increased the 
necessary quorum from half to three-fourths of the total 
members.  In later discussions, Sultan Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi, 
UAE Central Bank Governor, felt that the issue was not 
critical and predicted that the internal group pressure would 
keep the group from deviating from FATF principles. 
 
4. (U) On the second day of the conference, the delegation 
heads from the attending member nations ratified the 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) to create the new body and 
establish the secretariat in Bahrain.  This was followed by a 
press conference announcing the new organization\'s  first 
President, Vice President and Executive Secretary.   The 
group chose Dr. Muhammad Baasiri of Lebanon as the first 
President, and Mahmoud Abdel Latif of Egypt as the first Vice 
President to serve 1-year terms.  Additionally, Adel Hamad Al 
Qulish of Saudi Arabia will act as the Executive Secretary 
for a four-year term.  They also announced that the first 
plenary meeting would be held no later than the end of March 
2005 in Lebanon.  The only item not agreed upon, or even 
discussed at the meeting was the work program for the MENA 
FATF - this will be the primary discussion at the upcoming 
plenary. 
 
US/ME & NA Bilateral Meetings on AML/CFT 
 
5. (U) During the two-day conference, the US delegation met 
with representatives from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Iraq, 
Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Qatar, UAE, Algeria, and Bahrain.  They 
also held a trilateral meeting with Syria, Iraq and the 
United States.  During the bilateral meetings, the US 
delegation addressed implementation of money laundering and 
terrorism financing regulations and inquired about the 
problem of cash couriers and how the countries were 
regulating this possible loophole.  (Note: The meetings with 
Syria, Jordan, Kuwait, and UAE, are addressed in Septels. End 
note.) 
 
Kudos to the Bahrainis 
 
6. (U) On December 1, A/S Zarate and Charge met with Abdullah 
Hassan Saif, Minister of Finance and National Economy, and 
Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, the Governor of the 
Bahrain Monetary Agency.  Zarate congratulated the Minister 
on the success of the MENA FATF inaugural and on his 
leadership in bringing about this new regional body.  Saif 
felt the new organization was a vote of confidence for 
Bahrain,s efforts in AML/CFT issues. 
 
7. (U) Saif also indicated that Bahrain was working to 
establish a special court to try financial crimes and that 
they had already sent some judges to training courses on 
financial crimes.  When Zarate brought up new Section 311 
authority created by the USA PATRIOT Act, Saif recommended 
that instead of using this unilateral tool the USG should 
provide countries with the necessary information and let them 
take steps to correct any problems.  Specifically Saif said 
that they would take the action if there was any issue in 
Bahrain. 
 
8. (U) Comment. MENA FATF is a significant development for 
the region.  As a FATF styled regional body, it will promote 
best practices on AML/CFT issues, do mutual evaluations of 
its members against the FATF standards, and work with its 
members to comply with international standards and measures. 
The MENA region has been slow to loosen banking secrecy laws, 
adopt proper compliance systems, and is seen as a haven for 
terrorism financing.  Therefore, the creation of the MENA 
FATF is critical for pushing the Middle East and North 
African region to improve the transparency and regulatory 
frameworks of their financial sectors.  However, the real 
success of the MENA FATF will be if it can get its members to 
implement and enforce the new laws and regulations.

REF: (A) STATE 242449 
 
Classified By: JZARATE 
 
(C) Summary. On the margins of the inaugural meeting of the 
Middle East/North Africa Financial Action Task Force, 
Treasury A/S Juan Zarate met with Syrian Minister of Finance 
Dr. Mohamed Al-Hussain and Dr. Douraid Dergham, the chairman 
of the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBS).  They discussed the 
steps the Syrians need to take for the removal of the Section 
311 designation of the CBS as a \"primary money-laundering 
concern\".  Most of the discussion eventually focused on the 
condition that Syria transfer Iraqi assets frozen in CBS to 
the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI).  Minister Al-Hussain 
committed to work with Iraq and again called for an Iraqi 
delegation to come to Damascus to resolve the issue.  This 
discussion was followed by two separate \"trilateral\" meetings 
between Minister Al-Hussain, A/S Zarate, and representatives 
from the Iraqi Finance Ministry and Central Bank who were 
present in Bahrain.  The Iraqis initially insisted that all 
Iraqi funds at CBS be immediately transferred to the DFI 
pursuant to UNSCR 1483.  Eventually, the Syrians and Iraqis 
agreed that a meeting in Damascus would occur following the 
transfer of a relatively small amount ($3-6 million) from CBS 
to DFI.  The Syrians asserted that this transfer could be 
effected within a week. End Summary 
 
(C) Syria Responds to Action Items 
 
(C) On November 29, 2004, on the margins of the MENA FATF 
inaugural meeting, a US delegation led by Treasury A/S Juan 
Zarate with representatives from Treasury, OFAC, FinCEN, FBI, 
and State, met with a Syrian delegation headed by Dr. Mohamed 
Al-Hussain the Syrian Minister of Finance, and including Dr. 
Douraid Dergham, the chairman of the Commercial Bank of Syria 
(CBS).  The meeting focused on a Treasury Department list of 
Action Items that Embassy Damascus presented to the Syrians 
in November (Ref A).  The Syrians must address and correct 
these action items in order to continue the postponement of 
the issuance of the final rule implementing the Section 311 
designation of the CBS and for the eventual lifting of the 
Section 311 designation. (Note. Section 311 refers to a 
section of the Patriot Act that gives the Treasury the 
ability to designate a foreign entity or country as a 
\"primary money-laundering concern\" and to require U.S. 
financial institutions to terminate correspondent 
relationships with the designated entity or country. 
Endnote.) 
 
(C) Al-Hussain stressed the Syrian willingness to work with 
the USG on these issues and wanted to bring back positive 
results to Syria.  He also wanted a definite time frame and 
closure to the issue if the Syrians accomplished the US 
requests.  Zarate explained that the USG would need to see 
real progress and good faith on issues of concern in order to 
be in a position to reconsider the 311 designation.  Zarate 
also stated that the US expects Syria to act as a partner in 
these issues and there may be more lists of requests in the 
future.  For example, establishing FIU to FIU relations 
involves an ongoing and evolving relationship and mutual 
information exchange. 
 
(C) Al Hussain then laid out the steps the Syrians have taken 
in reference to the Treasury,s list of sixteen Action Items 
(Note: For ease of reference the action item number will 
follow the item discussed. Endnote).  Al Hussain addressed 
eight of the action items and said that not all the Action 
Items required new legislation but could be enacted through 
decree.  Al Hussain stated that:  the Money Laundering 
Commission is being reviewed to remove both private and 
publicly-owned banks from the Commission (#3); private banks 
working in the free trade zones were subject to the Central 
Bank (#5); the Ministry of Finance was working with the 
Central Bank to refine the rules and control the money flow 
(#6); Customs is tightening its rules on money crossing the 
border.  They have had incidents of money smuggling (into 
Lebanon) but he reported they weren,t money laundering or 
terrorism financing (#7); they will extend an invitation to 
the IMF/World Bank for an AML/CFT assessment (#8); charitable 
organizations can now only send \"in-kind\" contributions for 
humanitarian aid and not money (#10); the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs is examining the International Convention on the 
Suppression of Terrorist Financing for ratification (#12). 
Finally, Al-Hussain stated that they were collecting the 
specific account information requested (# 16) and would 
provide it once they worked out the legal issues with the 
Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and other Ministries. 
(Comment: Al Hussain did not address items 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 
13-15 directly during the meeting. End Comment) 
(C) Al Hussain expressed disappointment that A/S Zarate 
characterized the cooperation by the Syrians as \"weak\" in Mr. 
Zarate,s testimony to Congress and stressed the Syrian 
willingness to work together on these issues. 
 
(U) Technical Assistance Request 
 
(U) Al-Hussain expressed a need for technical assistance on 
customs and banking issues.  Mr. Zarate said he would explore 
options for technical assistance with Customs and other 
appropriate agencies back in Washington. 
 
(C) Iraqi Assets:  Syria still waiting for Iraqi delegation 
to Damascus 
 
(C) Al Hussain reiterated the Syrian position, on Iraqi 
assets in Syria, that they would be willing to discuss the 
issue with the proper Iraqi delegation in Damascus - but so 
far no one has come.  The Syrians would like to meet with the 
Iraqi Minister of Finance, Oil Minister, General Manager of 
SOMO, and the Central Bank Governor.  Mr. Zarate stated that 
the Jordanians had already released the assets back to Iraq. 
To this Al-Hussain reiterated that they wouldn,t accept any 
official unless they come with the proper authority and 
credentials to disperse funds to the right people. 
 
(C) After the bilateral meeting two trilateral meetings were 
held among the Iraqi delegation (Dr. Sabah Awny, from the 
Ministry of Finance and Ms. Hanna Ibraheem Alkhafiaji, from 
the Central Bank), the Syrians and the US.  The Iraqi 
delegation initially insisted that all funds that had been 
located in Syria as of May 2003 (the date of the passage of 
UNSCR 1483) should be immediately transferred to the DFI. 
After much discussion of cash versus trade accounts, the 
requirements of UNSCR 1483, and the magnitude and nature of 
Syrian commercial claims, Dr. Sabah agreed that he would 
gather the appropriate delegation to come to Damascus. Dr. 
Dergham (Chairman of CBS) stressed his confidence that an 
overall resolution could be reached within 2-3 weeks of the 
arrival of an Iraqi delegation in Damascus. Minister Al 
Hussain in turn agreed to transfer the funds (approximately 
USD3.5 million) in the non-protocol accounts to the DFI quote 
next week unquote.

 1.  (S) SUMMARY: Minister of Defense al-Khalifa outlined for 
the Ambassador the timeline for the proposed deployment of 
Special Forces troops to Afghanistan.  Training for the 
deployment will begin in the UAE in January 2005.   Both 
Bahrain and UAE want the deployment to be low profile.  After 
meeting with the Iraqi President, Bahrain will now focus on 
training of Iraqi civil defense personnel and has withdrawn 
its offer to send its ships to patrol Iraqi coastal waters. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (S) In an 8 December meeting with Ambassador Monroe, the 
Minister of Defense, General Shaikh Khalifa al-Khalifa, 
discussed the timeline for Bahrain\'s planned deployment of a 
Special Operations Company to Afghanistan in cooperation with 
the UAE contingent there.  Before going into details, the 
Minister emphasized both Bahrain and UAE want to keep this 
deployment low profile and would not go public.  The Bahrain 
Defense Force will send four officers and 28-30 enlisted 
personnel from their Special Forces to UAE on 18 January 2005 
for a four-month training period with UAE forces.  At the 
conclusion of the training, the troops will deploy with their 
UAE counterparts to Afghanistan for a six-month rotation for 
participation in Operation Enduring Freedom. 
 
3. (C) After discussion on the deployment, the Ambassador 
strongly urged the Minister to send a liaison officer to 
CENTCOM MacDill when the Bahraini troops deploy.  He also 
reemphasized that Bahrain has a standing invitation from 
CENTCOM to send a liaison officer regardless of any deployed 
Bahraini personnel.  The Minister said he will strongly 
consider sending a liaison officer but did not commit. 
 
4. (S) The Minister said the offer for a Bahraini ship to 
assist with protection of Iraqi coastal waters had been 
pulled after discussions with Iraqi President, Ghazi 
al-Yawar.  During President Yawar,s visit to Bahrain last 
month, Yawar decided to focus on civil defense training at 
this time.  To this end, Bahrain is now engaged with the 
training of 4000 Iraqi firefighters over the next few years. 
(Comment:  The training of the Iraqi firefighters will be 
hosted by Bahrain, conducted by US contractors, and funded by 
the IIG.)

SUBJECT: ABDEL AZIZ AL-HAKIM DISCUSSES IRAQI FUTURE WITH 
BAHRAIN LEADERSHIP 
 
Classified By: William T. Monroe  Reason: 1.4 (B)(D) 
 
 1. (C) Summary. SCIRI Chairman Al-Hakim visited Bahrain this 
week, bringing a positive message of reassurance that Iraqi 
Shia wished to work with Sunnis to forge a new Iraq. 
Hegemony of one faction, he insisted, was not a model for 
Iraq.  He said he had talked with many Sunni religious 
leaders in Ramadi and elsewhere who complained of 
intimidation by extremists.  He accused the media of 
distortion in suggesting that civil war was developing in 
Iraq, saying that Sunnis and Shia were much too linked for 
the country to split apart.  He said the terrorists who 
attacked the consulate in Jeddah had been trained in Iraq and 
slipped back into Saudi Arabia after Ramadan.  King Hamid 
reiterated to Al-Hakim Bahrain\'s support for the political 
process. Bahrain\'s Minister of Islamic Affairs complained 
over lunch with Al-Hakim about certain recent actions by Shia 
Bahrain.   End summary. 
 
2. (C) SCIRI Chairman Abdel Aziz Al-Hakim visited Bahrain 
December 11-12 as part of a tour of the region, meeting the 
King, Prime Minister, and a wide range of local Shia leaders 
and scholars.  Al-Hakim told the press that the purpose of 
his visit was to reassure neighboring countries of the 
positive political role that the Shia would play in the 
future of Iraq, a message that was reflected in both his 
public and private comments.  In addition to Bahrain, his 
itinerary also includes the UAE, Kuwait, Syria, Turkey, and 
Saudi Arabia (twice: first to do Umrah last week, and 
returning this week to meet Crown Prince Abdullah), according 
to Iraq\'s Ambassador to Bahrain Ghassan Hussein. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Hussein told the Ambassador that the 
meeting with the King lasted a full 80 minutes, during which 
the King reiterated Bahrain\'s full support for the political 
process in Iraq and its hope for the full participation of 
all parties in the upcoming elections, including Sunnis. 
Al-Hakim, for his part, told the King that Iraq cannot 
develop into a hegemony of one faction over others.  There 
should be a consensus of all factions.  The Shia as a 
majority, he said, cannot impose its will on others.  Hakim 
praised the model of the Governing Council which he felt, 
although criticized by many, was in fact a reflection of a 
kind of consensus among many factions.  Even the Christian 
member did not feel that he was just one against 24, but 
rather one of 24.  The decision to head the Governing Council 
from a rotating panel of nine reflected this desire for 
consensus.  It was, he said, a model for a new Iraq.  \"We 
don\'t want hegemony of one faction,\" he repeated. 
 
4. (C) Turning to the elections, Al-Hakim cited a recent 
independent poll in Iraq which indicated that 60 percent of 
the people in Ramadi are in favor of holding elections. He 
said that he had met many prominent Sunnis religious scholars 
from that area who complained of intimidation by extremists 
who wanted to impose their views on them.  He used similar 
language in describing Falluja, saying the people there had 
been taken hostage by the extremists who wanted to impose 
their views.  He noted that after the liberation of Falluja, 
there had been no demonstrations or protests in Iraq, not 
even in Ramadi.  The King joked that even in Bahrain there 
had been two protest marches against the action in Falluja. 
 
5. (C) Al-Hakim dwelled at some length in his meetings on the 
distortion of developments in Iraq by the media, which 
describes the situation as a case of civil war.  It is true 
that Zarqawi is calling for a civil war and wants to wage 
civil war, Al-Hakim stated, but he has failed in this effort. 
 In fact, Iraq is much more complex than a simple Sunni-Shia 
division that risks succumbing to civil war. It has major 
tribes (Janahiya, Jabbour, Shamar) that are half Sunni, half 
Shia.  Shia and Sunnis have many links, including through 
intermarriage.  He said that he could not imagine that Iraq 
could be split apart. 
 
6. (C) According to Ambassador Hussein, Bahrain\'s recent 
offer at Sharm Al-Shaykh to host a meeting in Bahrain of 
moderate political parties was raised in passing during the 
meeting with the King.  Al-Hakim thanked the King for his 
offer, but did not explore it more deeply. 
 
7. (C) Al-Hakim discussed with the King, and also with the 
media, the recent attack on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah. 
Al-Hakim told the King that terrorists in the attack had been 
trained in Falluja over the previous six months, and had 
returned to Saudi Arabia just after Ramadan to launch their 
attack.  He cited this to the press as an example why it was 
important for Iraq\'s neighbors to work together for the 
stability of Iraq.  He denied to the press that Iran or Syria 
were interfering in the election process. 
 
8. (C) Ambassador Hussein said that Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister for Islamic Affairs Shaykh Abdullah Al-Khalifa 
invited Al-Hakim for a luncheon on December 12 that was 
attended by major Shia leaders and ulema in Bahrain, 
including the leaders of the four opposition Shia groups that 
boycotted the last election and have remained outside the 
political process.  During the lunch, Shaykh Abdullah had 
critical words for the Shia in Bahrain.  He complained that 
Shia leaders had recently set up a Religious Scholars Council 
that in effect rivaled the existing official Supreme Council 
for Islamic Affairs, which falls under Shaykh Abdullah\'s 
Ministry of Islamic Affairs.  And he complained that Shia 
picked December 17 to celebrate Martyrs Day, even though that 
comes at the same time that the country celebrates is 
National Day/King\'s Coronation Day.  Al-Hakim told Shaykh 
Abdullah he was not aware of these concerns.

 1. (C) Minister of Finance Abdulla Seif, just back from the 
Forum for the Future meeting in Rabat, was short on details 
about discussions on the margins of the Forum about the FTA 
dispute with Saudi Arabia, but expressed confidence that a 
formula will be found to resolve the issue within the GCC. 
He noted that GCC Finance Ministers will meet in Manama on 
December 18 (followed by a Foreign Ministers meeting on the 
19th), and said he thought the situation would be much 
clearer after the Finance Ministers meeting. 
 
2. (C) Separately, Saudi Ambassador in Bahrain Dr. Abdulla El 
Khuwaiz told the Ambassador that he had been surprised when 
Prince Saud had raised the issue during his speech at the 
IISS conference in Bahrain on December 5.  Asked why he 
thought his government was raising it at this point, he said 
that the Saudi government looks at these FTAs with the GCC 
countries, especially when they are being extended beyond 
Bahrain, as an attempt by the USG to weaken Saudi Arabia.  He 
contrasted U.S. eagerness to negotiate FTAs with other GCC 
countries with its apparent efforts to block Saudi entrance 
into the WTO, even though in some ways Saudi\'s market is more 
open than other GCC countries (as an example, he said that 
Saudia Arabia\'s financial sector is more open than Kuwait\'s). 
 The Ambassador replied that he was not up-to-date on the 
specifics of Saudi Arabia\'s WTO accession effort, but was 
certain the discussions were driven purely by technical 
WTO-related considerations. 
 
3. (C) Asked about Bahraini perceptions that Saudi Arabia is 
putting an economic squeeze on Bahrain, most notably through 
the cut-off of sales of sand and the dropping of a 50,000 
barrel per day oil grant, Ambassador Khuwaiz made the 
following points: 
 
-- on the sand, he said it grew out of a dispute among Saudi 
companies that had licenses to sell sand to Bahrain from the 
Eastern Province.  Apparently, a loser in a recent contract 
got angry and retaliated by putting together a case that 
showed environmental degradation at the sand pits, with water 
filing up the pits and causing a health hazard.  This got the 
attention of Riyadh, which put a stop to the sand sales until 
the issue could be resolved.  On the table now is a proposal 
to form a Saudi-Bahrain joint venture to sell sand from the 
Eastern Province, but this is languishing on the desk of the 
Minister of Petroleum (also responsible for minerals such as 
sand). 
 
-- on the oil cutoff, he said this was dropped after Bahrain 
convinced the Saudis, against their wishes, to expand the 
existing oil field (the Saudis felt this would prematurely 
degrade the field).  Ending the 50,000 b/d oil gift, he said, 
was part of the deal, but now the Bahrainis want to reclaim 
it.  There is resistance to restoring it because people in 
Riyadh question why Saudi Arabia should continue to subsidize 
Bahrain when in fact Bahrain\'s per capita income is higher 
than Saudi Arabia\'s.  The Saudi government is now looking at 
some sort of compromise that would restore the 50,000 b/d 
temporarily in order to allow Bahrain to use it to repay the 
loan it took out to finance the expansion of the field.

4 MEETING WITH BAHRAINI CROWN PRINCE SALMAN 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Bahraini Crown Prince Salman December 4 on the margins of the 
IISS Gulf Security Dialogue conference in Manama.  DNSA 
Hadley praised Bahrain\'s leadership role in the G8 Broader 
Middle East reform initiative, and noted the President\'s 
desire for progress in Israel/Palestinian peace negotiations. 
 The Crown Prince stated that the international community has 
to communicate its model of a just society to counteract Al 
Qaida\'s dangerous ideas.  DNSA Hadley requested financial 
support for the Palestinian Authority to ensure its viability 
following the January elections.  The Crown Prince raised the 
increase in U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq, and DNSA 
Hadley said that this was a temporary measure to increase 
security during the Iraqi election period but that in the 
long term Iraqis would comprise a larger percentage of the 
troop strength.  The CP said that Bahrain would support an 
Iraqi decision to delay the elections, but the Iraqis had not 
decided to do this.  Turning to Bahrain, the CP said that 
Bahrain had arrested the terrorist suspects to disrupt a plot 
to attack before the U.S. elections.  He could not predict 
what the court might decide in the case against the four 
suspects.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Leader in Middle East Reform 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) DNSA Hadley opened the December 4 meeting by thanking 
the Crown Prince for his comments in the IISS Gulf Security 
Dialogue conference, particularly about the U.S. seeking to 
help those interested in political and economic reform in the 
Middle East.  The President believes strongly in the G8 
Broader Middle East and North Africa initiative and 
recognizes Bahrain\'s leadership role.  The President sees a 
strategic opportunity to achieve progress in the 
Israel/Palestine issue.  The Crown Prince pointed out his 
view that the U.S. tends to talk privately to Israel but 
publicly to the Arabs.  The U.S. is in the process of 
reassessing its approach and is looking for the best way to 
move ahead. 
 
3.  (C) The Crown Prince said Bahrain recognizes that 
maintaining security in an interdependent world requires 
close coordination and communication.  If there are concerns, 
we have to address them right away and eliminate any 
misunderstanding.  Al Qaida is propagating dangerous ideas 
and we cannot let the terrorists bring us to our knees.  We 
know we have a more just model of how we should live, and we 
have to promote this model. 
 
------------------------ 
Financial Support for PA 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) DNSA Hadley said the PA is strapped for cash and that 
Finance Minister Fayyad is under pressure each month to pay 
salaries.  The international community should come together 
to ensure that the PA is more financial viable following the 
January 9 elections.  Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Mubarak 
Al Khalifa interjected that Mahmoud Abbas needs all the help 
he can get.  PM Sharon did not give him a chance to succeed 
when Abbas was prime minister.  On the financial side, donors 
look at all the money that was given for schools and other 
infrastructure projects, and it all was destroyed.  Some 
people ask why they should help again.  He said, however, \"we 
in the Gulf are ready to help Abbas\" to give him a chance to 
succeed.  In response to the Crown Prince\'s question, DNSA 
Hadley replied that Hamas appears strong but the PA security 
forces might be able to address the threat if they cooperated 
and strengthened their capabilities.  The CP said that Hamas 
is popular in Gaza because it provides better services than 
the PA and is not corrupt. 
 
------------------------------ 
Al Qaida Allied with Baathists 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) DNSA Hadley said that the U.S. and its allies had 
eliminated 75 percent of Al Qaida\'s leadership.  Local groups 
associated with Al Qaida now have much looser affiliations 
than was the case previously, and they do not have the 
capacity to carry out a huge attack like 9/11.  In Iraq, Al 
Qaida may be allying itself with the Baathists, and our goal 
should be to isolate them from the rest of the Iraqi 
population.  The Crown Prince mentioned that the U.S. was 
increasing the number of troops on the ground in the lead up 
to the January 30 elections, and agreed that this was 
necessary.  DNSA Hadley said that this was for a temporary 
period only and Iraqis would eventually comprise a larger 
percentage of the troop strength in the country, but this 
takes time.  U.S. forces in Iraq currently are a source of 
both security and insecurity. 
 
6.  (C) DNSA Hadley suggested that Iraq\'s immediate priority 
should be to get Iraqi Sunnis to participate in the upcoming 
Iraqi elections.  Though some had been encouraging the U.S. 
to delay the elections, Hadley pointed out that this is an 
Iraqi decision, not an American one.  The Crown Prince 
responded that Bahrain would support an Iraqi decision to 
delay, but the Iraqis have not said this yet.  DNSA Hadley 
noted that the Shia want elections on time and delaying them 
could cause a real dilemma.  PM Alawi would have to decide 
what he wants to do. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Case Against Bahraini Terrorist Suspects 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Regarding combating terrorism, DNSA Hadley said that 
we must cooperate and share intelligence.  When we find bad 
guys, we have to keep them in custody and use the legal 
process against them.  In the case of Bahrain, we are aware 
that there are many pressures, but we are concerned about the 
arrest and release of terrorist suspects and the message this 
sends.  The CP replied that he understood the United States 
had been most interested in disrupting an attack prior to the 
U.S. elections.  The GOB had heard the U.S. say that Bahrain 
might or might not find something to use against the 
terrorists; the important thing was to disrupt the plot.  The 
Crown Prince said that Bahrain had found only what was on the 
suspects\' personal computers and nothing else.  When Bahrain 
locks someone away, it must be for a good reason.  At best, 
the suspects could be sentenced to three years in prison; at 
worst, they could get time served.  The most dangerous 
suspect is behind bars for six months for having fled the 
court during a September hearing.  The CP said he could not 
predict what the court might do to the four suspects.  The 
U.S. should see that Bahrain is doing the best it can within 
the rule of law.  The suspects are under tight surveillance 
and should not be cause for worry. 
 
8.  (C) In closing, DNSA Hadley alluded to U.S. concerns 
about a possible retreat from the GOB\'s commitment to 
political free speech and human rights, saying that 
Washington valued Bahrain\'s leading role in this field and 
hoped that it would be maintained.  The CP took the point. 
 
9.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
10.  (C) The NSC cleared this message.

member Faisal Foulad, founding members of the NGO called for 
stronger advocacy of human rights issues and vowed to play a 
role in the kingdom\'s democratization process.  Members said 
they would organize campaigns to encourage the GOB to sign 
international agreements related to human rights.  They also 
expressed concern for draft laws on the regulation of public 
gatherings and political and non-governmental societies.  The 
BHRWS supports the re-opening of the Bahrain Center for Human 
Rights (BCHR) and the integration of human rights education 
in schools. 
 
2.  (SBU) Comment: Many civil society activists criticize the 
BHRWS for being too close to the government and point out 
that it is not a substitute for the dissolved Bahrain Center 
for Human Rights.  They are correct in that the BHRWS will 
not fill the void once occupied by the Bahrain Center, but 
BHRWS members are genuine in their concern for human rights 
issues and interest in advocacy.  They will likely avoid 
highly sensitive areas and seek to work with the system, but 
they are unafraid of calling for close monitoring and 
evaluation of the GOB\'s policies.  Representatives of several 
human rights organizations, including some who worked closely 
with the BCHR, attended the launch and gave their support for 
the society.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal December 5 on the 
margins of the IISS Gulf Security Dialogue conference in 
Manama.  DNSA Hadley encouraged Saud to reach out to Iraqi 
Sunnis to participate in the January 30 elections.  The 
Foreign Minister said that the SAG had done so but questioned 
whether the elections would result in a stable and secure 
government and country.  He recommended that the Iraqis start 
with municipal elections and allow local political leaders to 
establish credibility and form the nucleus of political 
parties.  Saud doubted Syria would allow itself to become an 
assembly, training, and financing point for the Iraqi 
insurgency, saying this is \"too obvious.\"  Iran is fully 
operational inside Iraq, spreading its influence and 
establishing cells.  Saudi Arabia wants to normalize its 
relations with the U.S. while carrying out its internal 
reform process at deliberate speed, keeping in mind the 
nature of Saudi society.  DNSA Hadley pointed out that Saudi 
Arabia could do more, and said that Saudi Arabia\'s failure to 
include women voters in municipal elections had gotten a lot 
of attention in the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Reaching Out to Iraqi Sunnis 
---------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) DNSA Hadley opened the meeting by expressing the 
President\'s intention to reach out to friends and allies in 
order to reach global solutions to global problems.  He said 
the President plans to expend political capital on issues in 
the Middle East, particularly Israel/Palestine, where he sees 
an opportunity to achieve a breakthrough.  He also will focus 
on advancing the cause of liberty in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
In response to the Foreign Minister\'s question, DNSA Hadley 
replied that the U.S. is encouraging contact with Sunni 
opposition groups in Iraq, noting that he had delivered this 
message to each of his interlocutors at the IISS Gulf 
Dialogue conference.  Saud stated that the Sunnis had ruled 
Iraq for 50 years, and the IIG now faced a difficult 
diplomatic battle in getting the Sunnis to join the political 
process.  He said that the SAG had spoken with those Sunnis 
it knows inside Iraq and encouraged them to participate in 
the elections. 
 
3.  (C) DNSA Hadley noted that some say the IIG should delay 
the January 30 elections to buy more time for outreach to the 
Sunni community.  He said that while the U.S. agrees that 
outreach is important, we are very worried about letting the 
date slip.  There could be a negative reaction from the Shia 
in Iraq and the political process could lose momentum.  The 
ForMin stated that the elections are a means not an 
objective, and the important thing is the result, which 
should lead to a stable and secure government and country. 
Holding the elections that accomplish nothing could lead to 
people to say that the U.S. had tried elections, failed, and 
now was free to carry out a \"full fledged occupation.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
Start With Municipal Elections 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Saud continued that Saudi Arabia believes a system of 
gradual elections would be best, starting with municipal 
elections.  Elected local officials could assist people in 
rebuilding their lives in peace and security.  As a result of 
this process, political leaders would emerge who would form 
the nucleus of political parties.  Then ordinary citizens 
would not want to lose what they had gained and would turn 
away from the insurgents.  This would allow for conditions to 
improve from the ground up.  Pushing for elections and 
knowing they would be boycotted would be a tragic mistake.  A 
reasonable person could do more damage than good by trying to 
accomplish the impossible.  DNSA Hadley replied that the U.S. 
believes that both a good election and a good outcome are 
possible.  He emphasized that those who spend their time 
advocating for a delay could better devote their energies to 
encouraging Sunnis to participate. 
5.  (C) Saud suggested that greater attention should be 
devoted to security at the Iraq-Saudi border.  He is 
concerned about spillover from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, saying 
the SAG does not want jihadists from Iraq joining the fight 
inside Saudi Arabia.  He asserted that the SAG controlled 
movements across the border from Saudi Arabia into Iraq, and 
requested a strong effort to stop movement from Iraq into 
Saudi Arabia.  He said that inside Saudi Arabia, Al Qaida is 
almost completely destroyed, but there are signs of a new 
leadership entering the Kingdom from Iraq. 
 
------------------------ 
Pressure Points on Syria 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) In this regard, DNSA Hadley stated that the Syrian 
border concerns us the most.  Syria had become an assembly, 
training, and finance point for foreign fighters.  We are 
getting only symbolic cooperation at the border.  The ForMin 
said that the U.S. could use several pressure points with the 
Syrians:  the SARG badly wants a relationship with the U.S.; 
it does not want to be at the \"tail end\" of peace agreements 
with Israel; and the \"silly\" way Syria handles its 
relationship with Lebanon could be used to motivate Syria in 
the war against terror.  He doubted whether Syria was in fact 
a center for the leadership of the Iraqi resistance.  This 
was \"too obvious;\" Syria played a very careful game in 
dealing with Palestinian rejectionists.  DNSA Hadley 
disagreed, saying that the SARG tolerated Hamas and PIJ in 
Damascus. 
 
7.  (C) In response to the DNSA\'s question, Saud said that 
Iran is confused about its nuclear program.  You get 
different answers each day about whether the program is for 
power or fuel enrichment.  The government says one thing, the 
parliament something else, and influential people like 
Khamenei and Rafsanjani provide another view.  Iran is \"fully 
operational\" inside Iraq, with hundreds of thousands of 
people and enormous amounts of money.  Iran is quietly 
spreading its influence and creating cells inside Iraq while 
the U.S. is engaged with the Sunni insurgency. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Desire to Normalize Bilateral Relations 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) With regard to bilateral issues, the ForMin said that 
there was much press commentary in the U.S. about issues of 
concern in the relationship.  Although the 9/11 commission 
\"completely exonerated\" Saudi Arabia, the SAG continues to 
hear the same accusations as before.  He stated that Saudi 
Arabia wants to normalize our bilateral relations and not be 
forced to respond to what is written and said in the American 
media. 
 
9.  (C) Saud said that Saudi Arabia had done a lot in the war 
on terror and terrorism financing, but this goes unrecognized 
in the U.S.  He stated that the Kingdom\'s reforms may not be 
theatrical, such as, hypothetically, appointing a woman as 
president of the Shura Council, but the country is moving in 
the right direction, at deliberate speed, keeping in mind the 
nature of Saudi society.  For example, the SAG did not say 
Yes or No to women participating in municipal council 
elections, but it permitted women to be elected to chambers 
of commerce, where they now work side by side with men.  The 
government does not force solutions on the people, but 
creates the environment for them to take their own decisions. 
 The government intends to open to debate all subjects that 
formerly were taboo.  He asserted that ten years ago, Saudi 
Sunnis believed that Shia inside the country \"were devils.\" 
Now shaikhs from the two sects talk and eat dinner together. 
Saud cautioned that Saudi reforms would proceed at a 
sustainable, \"deliberate\" rate and that Saudi Arabia would 
never look like the West.  Moving faster on Shia rights was 
just too hard.  In a comment revealing much about how Saudi 
Arabia\'s Wahhabi heartland regards its Shia co-religionists, 
the ForMin said that forcing Nejdis to accept the validity of 
Shia Islam \"would be like the President bringing Michael 
Jackson to the Midwest and insisting he be everyone\'s role 
model.\" 
 
10.  (C) The Foreign Minister said that Saudi Arabia\'s rate 
of population growth had declined to 2.2 percent, a normal 
rate of increase.  The expat workforce inside the country was 
down to six million.  Per capita income rose from $7,000 to 
$11,500, and the poverty that was talked about earlier is 
\"not there.\"  Unemployment is down from millions to tens of 
thousands. 
------------------- 
Do What is Workable 
------------------- 
11.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that from the U.S. perspective, 
the SAG had combated terrorism seriously since the May 2003 
Riyadh attacks.  We were less understanding about what Saudi 
Arabia had done to combat terrorism financing.  Saudi 
Arabia\'s failure to include women voters in municipal 
elections had gotten a lot of attention in the U.S.  Saud 
replied that the SAG would always choose to do what was 
workable.  The majority of Saudis do not want to change the 
role of women.  In addressing reform, Saudi Arabia must move 
with alacrity but carefully, without breaking social cohesion 
and maintaining societal consensus.  But when the time comes 
for real decisions, the SAG does the right thing.  For 
example, the government four years ago directed that males 
and females receive the same education, over the objection of 
the religious establishment.  The SAG has removed from the 
mosques those who preach hate.  But the government avoids 
taking symbolic steps with no real impact.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Iraqi National Security Advisor Qassem Daoud December 4 on 
the margins of the IISS Gulf Security Dialogue conference in 
Manama.  Daoud said that Iraq faced a number of crises: 
obtaining weapons quickly; procuring helicopters and armored 
vehicles; improving the doctrine of Iraq\'s armed forces; and 
moving funds quickly to rebuild destroyed areas.  On the 
elections, the two officials agreed that Iraq should maintain 
the January 30 date for holding elections.  A delay could 
alienate Iraq\'s Shia community, and Daoud said that Ayatollah 
Sistani was losing patience.  Daoud stated that Iraq could 
\"live with\" Iran for the time being, but that we need a 
strong joint position against Syria.  Iraq is considering 
raising the issue of Syrian support for the insurgency to the 
UN Security Council.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Controlling Terrorism Top Challenge 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Iraqi National Security Advisor Qassem Daoud told 
DNSA Hadley December 4 that the number one issue facing Iraq 
is how to control terrorism inside the country.  Iraqi forces 
need the tools to fight the insurgency, which is growing 
faster than expected.  There are times when three policemen 
have to share one machine gun.  MNF-I General Patraeus is 
doing a great job, Daoud said, but \"we need ten Patraeuses\" 
to accelerate the movement of arms to Iraqi security 
services.  Daoud said that the IIG is exploring the 
possibility of procuring arms from Russia and Ukraine, where 
the right types of weapons are readily available.  Purchasing 
weapons from the United States, he said, is a complicated 
process.  He added that Iraq also had an imminent need for 
helicopters and armored cars. 
 
3.  (C) Daoud stated that Iraq needed to accelerate the 
formation of effective military units.  Though Iraq requires 
a professional fighting force, its first priority is to focus 
on the right doctrine.  The military structure under former 
regime was created to serve an individual (Saddam) and the 
Baath Party.  The new organization must serve the state and 
the people.  Training focusing on this philosophy will enable 
to military forces to remain cohesive in the face of attacks. 
 In the long run, Iraq needs a sophisticated army capable of 
fully defending its borders. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bureaucracy Slows Reconstruction Funds 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Daoud continued that he was concerned about the way 
reconstruction funds were funneled through the bureaucracy, 
which slows things down.  He said that Najaf was hit for ten 
days in August, and the city\'s residents still have not 
received money to rebuild their homes.  In Fallujah, there is 
ten times the amount of damage, and Iraq needs a procedure to 
quickly compensate people in cash, which empowers citizens to 
make their own decisions about spending the funds.  This 
would also help win their sympathy if not their loyalty.  If 
the authorities decide to repair someone\'s roof, the owner 
can complain that what he really needs is new plumbing.  Cash 
allows the owner to do what he wants and should result in 
fewer complaints. 
 
5.  (C) DNSA Hadley agreed that moving the funds 
expeditiously would promote economic activity and boost 
employment, and asked whether the funds should move through 
ministries, provincial governments, or municipal councils. 
Daoud replied that the IIG had created a ministerial 
reconstruction board that would develop options.  He 
suggested the creation of a loan board that would disburse 
funds to people rebuilding their homes.  In response to DNSA 
Hadley\'s question, Daoud said that provincial and municipal 
governments were not very effective yet, and they were often 
\"unreasonable - some want their own treaties with Iran.\" 
This idea would be something to explore following the 
formation of a national government.  In the meantime, the IIG 
wants to centralize the process. 
 
------------------------------ 
No Right to Postpone Elections 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) DNSA Hadley noted that Daoud had spoken with 
conviction in his speech at the IISS conference about 
sticking to the January 30 date for the elections.  DNSA 
Hadley warned that pressure would build for the IIG to delay, 
both in mid-December when the candidate lists are due and in 
January in the run up to the elections.  In our view, the 
elections should take place on January 30.  This is what the 
Iraqi people and the election commission want.  In addition, 
a delay could disillusion the Shia community.  Daoud said 
that he regarded the coming period as a \"holy timetable.\" 
The election date must be respected in a very firm way, and 
no authority has the right to postpone the election. 
 
7.  (C) DNSA Hadley noted that when people say the election 
should be delayed, we reply that all sectors of Iraqi society 
should participate, including the Sunnis, so they should 
hurry up and get ready.  We are encouraging all those with 
influence to reach out to the Sunnis to urge them to 
participate.  Daoud responded that Ayatollah Sistani was the 
most important factor in the equation.  He has asked for 
elections three times and did not get them.  Daoud said that 
he believes Sistani is losing patience, and a delay in the 
election could lead to huge problems in the south.  DNSA 
Hadley asked what the IIG could do to encourage Sunni 
participation, noting that Jordan and Bahrain had both 
offered to host conferences on the elections.  Daoud said the 
most important thing the IIG could do to ensure full 
participation is stabilize the security situation in the 
population centers.  He stated that he was working to 
establish a national list of candidates made up of Sunni and 
Shia.  IIG President Yawar, PM Allawi, other ministers, and 
he are all on the list.  He suggested that this list would 
attract a reasonable number of Sunni voters. 
 
------------------------------- 
Bombs Come from Syria, Not Iran 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) DNSA Hadley asked Daoud his opinion of the Sharm El 
Sheikh conference.  Daoud said he was happy with the results 
because the participants had recognized Iraqi sovereignty. 
He warned, however, that Iraq had problems with \"the naughty 
neighbors,\" Iran and Syria.  Iraq could \"live with\" Iran for 
the time being, though Iranian intelligence was working 
inside Iraq.  The PM had formed a committee to develop a 
strategy to deal with Iran.  Daoud believes that Iraq needs 
close relations with both Iran and Turkey to balance these 
two strong neighbors, hence a strategy was needed for Turkey 
as well.  \"There should be equal treatment.  I checked this 
with the Kurds.  Jalal (Talabani) was easier than Masud 
(Barzani).\"  Iraq benefits from Iranian religious tourism, 
which brings in $2.5 billion per year.  With Turkey, water is 
the most important issue, and Iraq wants to create deep 
economic links with Turkey.  Allawi plans to visit both 
countries by early January. 
 
9.  (C) Regarding Syria, Daoud asserted that Iraq must stake 
a strong position.  Car bombs come from Syria, not Iran.  The 
PM and Foreign Minister Zebari are talking about raising 
Syrian meddling inside Iraq to the UN Security Council.  Iraq 
has solid documentation showing that Syrian intelligence 
officials are in direct contact with leaders of the 
insurgency.  Syria only understand force.  When Syria faced 
strong action from Turkey, it kicked Ocalan and the rest of 
the PKK out of the country.  Iraq needs the support of the 
United States to use the same tactic now against Syria.  He 
said that if UNSC action does not improve Syria\'s behavior, 
the international community should threaten Syria with 
economic sanctions, under Chapter VII. 
 
10.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
11.  (C) The NSC cleared this message.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Omani Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 
Alawi bin Abdulla December 5 on the margins of the IISS Gulf 
Security Dialogue conference in Manama.  Bin Alawi said that 
Oman is looking forward to negotiating a free trade agreement 
with the United States during 2005 and foresees no problems. 
DNSA Hadley noted that bilateral counter terrorism 
cooperation was going well, and bin Alawi said that Oman 
would like closer coordination with the U.S. military and 
intelligence services.  Bin Alawi stated that the next 
Iranian president would be a conservative loyal to Khamenei, 
who does not want to repeat the Khatemi experience.  Khatemi 
told Omani officials during a November visit that if Iran 
does not conclude a agreement on the nuclear issue during his 
presidency, it will not happen.  Bin Alawi suggested that the 
international community could use Iran\'s interest in joining 
the WTO and other organizations to apply pressure for 
reforms.  He noted that Oman\'s contacts with Israel had never 
stopped and he hoped that Israel would help Abu Mazen build a 
better life for Palestinians.  Bin Alawi agreed to assist the 
U.S. in working with Qatar to improve Al Jazirah\'s coverage. 
End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
FTA Priority in Bilateral Relationship 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Omani Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf 
bin Alawi bin Abdulla told Deputy National Security Advisor 
Hadley December 5 that the bilateral relationship is very 
strong and improving.  He noted that the two countries would 
negotiate a free trade agreement in 2005, and he foresees no 
problems in completing the negotiations.  DNSA Hadley said 
that the FTA is a priority and the administration will work 
closely with Congress to ensure its ratification.  The 
administration has a good track record in getting FTAs 
through Congress.  Bin Alawi said that discussions so far are 
going well. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Seeking Improved CT Coordination 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that counter terrorism cooperation 
is going very well.  The U.S. recognizes that Oman is taking 
some difficult steps, and we want to support Oman in a 
discreet way.  Bin Alawi responded that the purpose of the 
cooperation is to achieve operational success, and Oman is 
working hard on all aspects of CT cooperation.  He suggested 
that CT efforts would be more effective if friendly countries 
developed a network to use against the terrorist networks. 
Joint efforts would be particularly useful in combating 
terrorism financing.  DNSA Hadley agreed, saying that 
cooperating countries often develop operational level 
intelligence that can be used to interdict shipments of 
weapons and WMD precursors.  He promised to take bin Alawi\'s 
suggestion back to Washington to encourage joint CT efforts 
in the Gulf region. 
 
4.  (C) Bin Alawi said that GCC-level CT cooperation was not 
very good.  Because of strained relations between some 
countries, in particular Qatari and Emirati relations with 
Saudi Arabia, the U.S. may want to consider a regional 
approach other than the GCC.  Oman\'s greatest CT challenge is 
controlling the movement of ships in the Gulf of Oman between 
Oman and Iran.  Oman is trying to enhance is capabilities in 
this area, and there are discussions between the Omani and 
U.S. military and intelligence services.  Improved 
coordination would be beneficial for the U.S. and the region. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
No Repeat of Khatemi Experience in Iran 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S) In response to DNSA Hadley\'s question, bin Alawi said 
that Iran is now under the control of the conservatives. 
Both of the main presidential candidates - Rouhani and 
Velayati - are close to Khamenei.  Rafsanjani is another 
possible candidate.  Khamenei does not want to repeat the 
experience of Khatemi and will bring in someone who is loyal 
to him.  A council will screen all candidates and those with 
credibility in the streets will be thrown out.  The years of 
a liberal president are over.  Khamenei\'s main motivation is 
domestic, not international.  The moderates want to abolish 
the \"velayat-e faghih,\" \"government by the jurisprudent,\" 
which is the main source of Islamic ruling legitimacy in 
Khomeini\'s vision of the Islamic Republic in Iran.  A 
foundation associated with this office controls 20 percent of 
Iran\'s oil revenue and places representatives into every 
significant organization in the country.  Bin Alawi said that 
the moderates would face tremendous opposition if they tried 
to abolish the velayat-e faghih because of the people and 
resources it controls.  A military revolution would be 
necessary to change the system, and this is not possible at 
the current time.  A new generation would be required to 
abolish the old system, and this will not happen for perhaps 
another twenty years.  Bin Alawi stated that Iran\'s 
leadership would find a way to buy off student leaders. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Time is Now for Deal on Nuclear Program 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (S) Bin Alawi noted that Khatemi visited Oman in November 
and discussed Iran\'s nuclear program.  He told the Omanis 
that if Iran does not conclude an agreement on the nuclear 
issue during his presidency, it will not happen.  Without an 
agreement, Iran might withdraw from international 
organizations that limit its flexibility.  Khatemi recognizes 
the dangers and so is pushing for a deal with the Europeans. 
He wants the international community to recognize Iran\'s 
right to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and 
Iran plans to build a 7,000 MW nuclear reactor over the 
coming years.  Bin Alawi said that Oman could accept a 
reactor, but because of Iran\'s military ambitions, could not 
rule out Tehran\'s possible development of nuclear weapons. 
 
7.  (S) Bin Alawi said that Khatemi believes the west let him 
down; he received praise, but nothing substantial.  Bin Alawi 
suggested that the international community could use Iran\'s 
interest in joining the WTO and other organizations to apply 
pressure for reforms.  DNSA Hadley acknowledged that using 
the accession process could be a way to  pressure Iran. 
 
--------------------- 
Support for Abu Mazen 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that the President is focused on 
the Middle East and sees some opportunities, particularly in 
the peace process.  PM Sharon recognizes that there is no 
shortcut from Palestinian elections to final status 
negotiations and wants to walk through the roadmap, if 
conditions permit.  He noted that Palestinian Finance 
Minister Fayyad has to beg for money to pay his budget each 
month.  The international community should do more to help 
him.  Bin Alawi said that Oman would do so, and hopes that 
Abu Mazen is elected president of the Palestinian Authority. 
Israel should help Abu Mazen build a better life for his 
people. 
 
9.  (C) DNSA Hadley suggested that Oman should allow the 
Israeli trade mission to return to the country once progress 
is made on a peace settlement.  Bin Alawi said that Oman\'s 
contacts with Israel had never stopped.  A GOI official is 
present in Oman as part of the Middle East Desalinization 
Resource Center - a holdover from the days of the Track Two 
peace process.  Bin Alawi met with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shalom in New York and they discussed the future of the peace 
process.  DNSA Hadley proposed that Oman raise the visibility 
of these contacts when a process is underway between the 
Israelis and Palestinians. 
 
----------------------------- 
Work Al Jazirah Issue Quietly 
----------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Bin Alawi mentioned that Oman shares U.S. concerns 
about Al Jazirah.  He said there is no point in speaking 
publicly about the problem; this should be done quietly.  He 
offered to work with us and the Qataris.  DNSA Hadley said 
that Al Jazirah is very troublesome.  Americans die in Iraq 
because of Al Jazirah coverage.  He said we would try to work 
this issue quietly and along with the Omanis.

Summary

1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Kuwaiti National Security Council President Shaikh Sabah 
Khaled Al Sabah December 4 on the margins of the IISS Gulf 
Security Dialogue conference in Manama.  Shaikh Sabah hailed 
the strong bilateral relationship and stated that Kuwaitis 
are more content now than at any point over the past few 
years.  Kuwait will work with the Iraqi government on debt 
forgiveness following the January 30 elections.  Kuwait is 
encouraging Sunnis in Iraq to participate in the elections. 
Iran advocated for the departure of foreign forces from Iraq 
by the end of 2005 during the regional interior ministers 
meeting it hosted, but Kuwait worked to remove this language 
from the communique.  DNSA Hadley commented that Iran should 
not be exempt from its responsibilities in the global war on 
terror.  While it had locked up Al Qaida leaders, it 
continued to provide support to Hizballah.  DNSA Hadley noted 
U.S. concern that Syria was being used as an assembly point 
for jihadists going to Iraq.  Shaikh Sabah replied that Syria 
claims to control movements into Iraq, but it was not doing 
enough.  Shaikh Sabah promised Kuwaiti political and 
financial support for the Palestinians, and noted that Abu 
Mazen would visit Kuwait soon.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Strong Relations, Strong Support 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley opened his 
December 4 meeting with Kuwaiti National Security Council 
President Shaikh Sabah Khaled Al Sabah by expressing his 
thanks for strong Kuwaiti support over the past two and a 
half years.  The U.S. relationship with Kuwait is crucial, 
and we look forward to continuing to work closely with 
Kuwait.  He recognized that Kuwait\'s supply of oil to the 
U.S. military is a generous contribution.  Shaikh Sabah 
agreed that the relationship is very strong, and Kuwaitis are 
more relaxed now than at any point over the past few years. 
Though Kuwait does not support the high international oil 
prices, it is benefiting and the stock market and trade flows 
are booming.  In response to DNSA Hadley\'s question, Shaikh 
Sabah said that Kuwait welcomed the Paris Club decision to 
forgive 80 percent of Iraq\'s debt.  Kuwait considers this 
percentage to be a guideline.  The GOK will discuss 
forgiveness with the Iraqi government following the elections. 
 
3.  (C) Shaikh Sabah told DNSA Hadley that Kuwait works 
closely with the United States on Iraq.  The GOK has reached 
out to the Sunnis in Iraq and encouraged them to participate 
in the January 30 elections.  DNSA Hadley recognized Kuwaiti 
outreach efforts to the Sunnis and said that broad 
participation is necessary for the elections to be seen as 
legitimate. 
 
-------------------------- 
Iranian Agenda Inside Iraq 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Shaikh Sabah said that Iranian Foreign Minister 
Kharazi visited Kuwait in November to discuss Iran\'s nuclear 
program.  Kharazi told the Kuwaitis that U.S. pressure would 
ruin any agreement with the Europeans because Iran does not 
believe the Europeans will stand up to America.  Shaikh Sabah 
said that Kuwait responded by telling Kharazi that Iran must 
convince the IAEA and the Europeans that it can be trusted. 
Kuwait offered to assist Iran if/when Iran is serious about 
making concessions.  In Iraq, Iran has its own agenda, and is 
encouraging the Shia in the south to participate in the 
elections.  Iran hosted a meeting of regional interior 
ministers on the situation in Iraq, and Iran tried to insert 
language in the communique stating that the multinational 
forces should depart Iraq by the end of 2005.  Kuwait 
objected, saying that Kharazi was at the Sharm meeting where 
this issue had been rejected.  Iran ultimately agreed to 
leave this language out of the statement. 
 
5. (C) DNSA Hadley said that Iran should not be exempt from 
its responsibilities in the global war on terror.  It has Al 
Qaida leaders under lock and key but, at the same time, it 
provides support to Hizballah.  Shaikh Sabah raised the 
Iranian presidential elections and said that the likely 
candidates would be Rouhani, Velayati, Youssefi, and possibly 
Rafsanjani, who claims to have good relations with the 
Europeans.  In the last election, the youth supported Khatemi 
but they now are disaffected.  They doubt the country will 
achieve progress through the electoral process. 
 
------------------------------ 
Syria Assembly Point for Jihad 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) DNSA Hadley expressed U.S. concerns about Syria, 
which is now serving as an assembly point for jihadists 
seeking to fight in Iraq.  Shaikh Sabah noted that Syria is 
facing pressure on Iraq, its relationship with Lebanon 
through UNSCR 1559, and the peace process.  Though the SARG 
claims to have begun to control movements into Iraq, its 
efforts have not been sufficient.  Kuwait has information 
that Iraqi Baathists are gathering inside Syria and are 
trying to influence events in Iraq.  The GOK was dismayed 
that two Kuwaiti boys, ages 16 and 17, traveled first to 
Damascus then to Fallujah to fight.  Shaikh Sabah wondered 
who encouraged, organized and paid for this travel?  He 
recommended that the U.S. use official channels to influence 
Syria, and stated that the U.S. should talk bluntly to the 
SARG.  Syrian Foreign Minister Sharaa visited Kuwait and 
asked the GOK about U.S. views.  The GOK responded that the 
United States is very clear and Sharaa should listen to what 
Secretary Powell says.

------------------------------------- 
Improving Palestinian Quality of Life 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Shaikh Sabah stated that Kuwait greatly appreciates 
the President\'s position on Palestine and the January 9 
elections.  The U.S. should encourage the international 
community to support the Palestinian people just as they are 
supporting the Iraqi people.  Abu Mazen will visit Kuwait 
shortly and the GOK will tell him that it will provide 
political and financial support to the Palestinians.  DNSA 
Hadley said that the United States wants to help Finance 
Minister Fayyad, and Kuwaiti assistance is critical.  The 
Palestinian Authority needs to have the comfort of sufficient 
finances.  The U.S. talks to the Israeli government about 
doing the right thing regarding the Palestinians.  Shaikh 
Sabah replied that Abu Mazen failed when he was prime 
minister, and PM Sharon did not help by refusing to release 
Palestinian prisoners.  Kuwait does not want to see the 
parties repeat their mistakes, and will support Abu Mazen and 
other moderate leaders who want to improve Palestinians\' 
quality of life. 
 
8.  (C) DNSA Hadley said that the United States seeks to 
encourage the voices of reform in the region and hoped Kuwait 
could play a role.  Shaikh Sabah stated that Kuwait would 
participate in the Forum for the Future meetings in Rabat, 
and expressed Kuwait\'s desire that Bahrain host the 2005 
meetings.  He noted that he supports NATO\'s Istanbul 
Cooperation Initiative to enhance stability in the Middle 
East region.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with UAE 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Under Secretary Abdallah Rashed 
Al Nuaymi December 4 on the margins of the IISS Gulf Security 
Dialogue conference in Manama.  Al Nuaymi said that the 
United Arab Emirates was pleased with progress in the 
bilateral relationship and seeks to expand the strategic 
partnership.  DNSA Hadley stated that the President sees an 
opportunity to make progress on the Israel/Palestinian issue 
and urged the UAE to support the Palestinian Authority and 
the new president.  Al Nuaymi said that the UAE would do so 
and hoped that PM Sharon does the right thing.  DNSA Hadley 
said that the United States wants full participation in 
Iraq\'s elections, and Al Nuaymi replied that the Sunnis need 
to know that they will get their share of power and will not 
be second class citizens.  Al Nuaymi said that Iran will not 
relinquish its nuclear ambitions and the international 
community must apply pressure at all times.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Expanding the Strategic Partnership 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Under Secretary Abdallah 
Rashed Al Nuaymi opened the December 4 meeting with Deputy 
National Security Advisor Hadley by emphasizing the 
importance the United Arab Emirates places on its bilateral 
relationship with the United States.  The two countries have 
achieved a lot of success in bilateral cooperation, and the 
UAE wants to ensure that relations move forward in all areas. 
 In 2002, the UAE and U.S. established a strategic 
partnership; the list of areas of bilateral cooperation now 
covers 27 pages, including political issues, counter 
terrorism, Iraq, and Afghanistan.  The UAE would like to 
focus on areas such as a free trade agreement and the 
G8/Broader Middle East Forum for the Future.  DNSA Hadley 
expressed his condolences for the passing of Shaikh Zayed and 
stated that the U.S. also wants to focus on the bilateral 
relationship, which has a lot of potential. 
 
------------------------------- 
Second Chance to Help Abu Mazen 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that the President believes there 
is a strategic opportunity for movement on the 
Israel/Palestinian issue, and he would like to see the 
countries of the region step up.  The Palestinians need help; 
each month, Finance Minister Fayyad needs money to pay 
salaries.  After the elections, the international community 
should help the new president with political and financial 
support.  This could be a second chance to help Abu Mazen. 
 
4.  (C) Al Nuaymi said that in the past the UAE had problems 
with Arafat, and now wants Abu Mazen back.  He is a close 
friend and the UAE will support him and the Palestinian 
people fully.  He hoped that Israel does not let this chance 
go by.  DNSA Hadley responded that NSC Senior Director Abrams 
was in Jerusalem to explore with the GOI what could be done 
after the elections.  PM Sharon has said the right things and 
we need to be sure that these words are transferred into 
deeds.  Al Nuaymi stated that Abu Mazen will do his best but 
he does not have all the strings to control Hamas and PIJ. 
He noted that Egypt should also play a major role by ensuring 
that Israel does not block progress or be heavy handed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Broadest Possible Participation in Iraqi Elections 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (C) DNSA Hadley told Al Nuaymi that the U.S. wants the 
broadest possible participation in the upcoming Iraqi 
elections.  We have to work together to assure the Sunnis 
that there is a place for them in the new Iraq.  There are 
calls from some for a delay in the elections, but we believe 
the message should be that now is the time for the Sunnis to 
get involved.  Al Nuaymi said that the UAE has believed from 
the beginning that Iraqis should govern themselves, and the 
issue now is how to get the Sunnis to the ballot box.  They 
need to know that they will get their share of political 
power and they will not be second class citizens.  They 
should feel they are part of the process and are fully 
engaged. 
6.  (C) DNSA Hadley said that the U.S. is telling Iraqis and 
others that the U.S. is steadfast in its determination to see 
through the Iraq project.  We will stay long enough for 
Iraqis to build a democracy and not one day longer.  Al 
Nuaymi said that the UAE understands this and wants Iraq to 
be a normal state respecting its neighbors and playing its 
role in the region. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Dangerous Iranian Nuclear Ambitions 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) In response to DNSA Hadley\'s question, Al Nuaymi said 
that Iran will not relinquish its nuclear ambitions.  It will 
evade and maneuver and when the international community turns 
away, will continue to work on its program.  There needs to 
be pressure on Iran at all times, particularly regarding 
nuclear weapons.  The IAEA must act forcefully on inspections 
because Iran will try to hide things.  The Europeans do not 
understand that Iran negotiates with different faces at 
different times.  In the end, deed count, not words.  DNSA 
Hadley said that the United States occasionally comes under 
pressure to negotiate with Iran, to alter our policy of 
sustained pressure.  Al Nuaymi replied that the UAE tells the 
Europeans, Japanese and others that it wants to see Iran 
living in harmony with its neighbors.  The UAE has strong 
trade and transportation links with Iran.  But it is scared 
of Iran because of its political system, military ambitions, 
and the role it is playing in Iraq. 
 
8.  (C) Al Nuaymi continued that there are three major 
variables determining the path Iran takes in the future: 
what role the older generation of revolutionaries plays in 
the future; the demands of the younger generation; and how 
stringent is internal security.  He said that change in Iran 
will not be quick, but history is moving in one direction and 
Iran will eventually have to move with it. 
 
9.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Yemeni Interior Minister Rashed Mohammed Al Alimi December 5 
on the margins of the IISS Gulf Security Dialogue conference 
in Manama.  Al Alimi thanked the U.S. for its counter 
terrorism assistance and expressed his desire to increase 
cooperation in this area.  Yemen faces a great challenge from 
the flow of refugees to Yemen from the Horn of Africa.  The 
ROYG had requested assistance from the U.S. naval command in 
Djibouti, and would like to expand its program of monitoring 
the coastline with its coast guard and through the use of hot 
air balloons.  DNSA Hadley indicated that Yemen should focus 
further on finding ways to stem the flow of weapons into the 
country, which is a source of instability in the region.  Al 
Alimi said that Yemen had requested help from Saudi Arabia 
but had not received a positive answer.  The link between the 
Saudi government and the religious establishment was a 
problem that would take a long-term strategy to solve.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Expanding Counter Terrorism Efforts 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Yemeni Interior Minister Rashed Mohammed Al Alimi 
opened the December 5 meeting with Deputy National Security 
Advisor Hadley by expressing his desire to increase 
cooperation with the United States on combating terrorism and 
in other fields.  He was pleased to participate in the IISS 
conference on Gulf security because by doing so Yemeni 
security was linked with the security of the Gulf.  He 
thanked DNSA Hadley for U.S. assistance to the Interior 
Ministry and the Yemeni Coast Guard.  The results have been 
very good, but he would like to do more.  DNSA Hadley 
responded that Yemen is a good model on counter terrorism, 
reform, and encouraging freedom and democracy.  Yemen does 
not get enough recognition for its efforts and the U.S. looks 
forward to deepening our bilateral cooperation. 
 
3.  (C) Al Alimi said that Yemen faces significant challenges 
from the Horn of Africa and Somalia, the source of many 
refugees.  Chief of Staff General Mohammed Ali Al Qassimi 
said that the Yemeni military had requested assistance from 
the U.S. naval command in Djibouti to stop the flow of 
refugees into Yemen.  Yemen has a long coastline and large 
numbers of refugees stream into the country from Africa.  The 
Yemeni government must obligate funds to the Coast Guard at 
the expense of other programs.  He noted that the use of hot 
air balloons is a good way to patrol the coastline at a 
reasonable cost and requested U.S. assistance to expand this 
program. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Weapons Source of Regional Instability 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) DNSA Hadley took note of the Yemeni request and 
stated his gratitude that the ROYG took into account U.S. 
concerns related to the Ramadan prisoner release.  The two 
countries are cooperating on MANPADS and the weapons buy-back 
program.  He stated that Yemen should focus further on the 
flow of arms into Yemen.  Though the U.S. would not be able 
to expand its buy-back program, it considers the presence of 
these weapons to be a source of instability in the region, 
including in Saudi Arabia. 
 
5.  (C) Al Alimi replied that the existence of weapons is of 
great concern to the ROYG and the security apparatus.  He 
noted that he had spoken with State Department Assistant 
Secretary Bloomfield about a long-term program to control 
 
SIPDIS 
these arms.  He reported that Yemen tells Saudi Arabia that 
many of these weapons are in the country as a result of the 
Yemeni civil war.  He said that he and Chief of Staff Al 
Qassimi visited Saudi Arabia and asked for assistance from 
their counterparts, but did not receive a positive response. 
The Yemenis suggested that Saudi Arabia, rather than 
allocating funds for border controls, assist the Yemenis in 
expanding the buy-back program. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Severing Link Between SAG and Ulama 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Al Alimi stated that Saudi Arabia had not been 
serious about combating terrorism until the Riyadh attacks in 
May 2003.  Prior to this, Yemen would pass the SAG names of 
terrorists and information about terror financing networks, 
and the Saudis would respond that these were \"only 
preachers.\"  Under Saudi Assistant Interior Minister Shaikh 
Mohammed bin Nayef, Yemeni-Saudi counter terrorism 
cooperation had expanded greatly.  The terrorism issue in 
Saudi Arabia is mostly political, said Al Alimi.  There is a 
strong link between the government and the religious 
establishment, and the SAG must implement a long-term 
strategy to sever this link. 
 
7.  (C) The NSC cleared this message.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with UK 
Foreign Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister Sir Nigel 
Sheinwald December 4 on the margins of the IISS Gulf Security 
Dialogue conference in Manama.  Sheinwald said that the UK 
government had solidified around the January 30 date for 
Iraqi elections.  He thought that PM Blair could accept a two 
to three week extension if the Iraqis could deliver something 
substantive in return, such as the participation of a major 
Sunni bloc.  Sheinwald expressed concern about being forced 
to make a public statement about the future of the coalition 
deployment in Iraq, and wondered if the coalition should get 
out in front and make a statement willingly.  DNSA Hadley 
thought that a statement would have to be very nuanced, and 
we stood by our position of staying as long as necessary and 
not one day more.  Any statement of a drawdown of forces 
should be evidence of success, not an exit.  Sheinwald 
requested USG information that would bolster the Dutch case 
to have the EU list Hizballah as a terrorist organization, 
and commented that the Iranians were already saying unhelpful 
things regarding the nuclear program negotiations.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Stick with January 30 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) UK Foreign Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister Sir 
Nigel Sheinwald told Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley 
December 4 that the UK government had solidified around the 
January 30 date for Iraqi elections.  In mid-December, the 
Iraqis would have to make a final decision about the timing, 
and Sheinwald wondered if it was worth giving them a few more 
weeks.  DNSA Hadley replied that pressure would come at two 
separate times:  first in mid-December, when the election 
lists are due, and second in late January, in the final 
run-up to the elections.  We can anticipate PM Allawi saying 
that he would need a few more months to convince some 
particular group of Sunnis to participate in the elections. 
This would put the IIG into a bind because a delay could win 
some Sunnis but lose a lot of Shia.  We would consider 
postponing the elections only if Allawi makes the request, he 
can deliver a major group of Sunnis before the election, and 
doing so will not alienate the Shia and Kurds.  But the 
President and PM Blair, added DNSA Hadley, will want to stick 
with January 30.  Sheinwald responded that Blair would accept 
a two to three week \"once-and-for-all\" extension if the 
Iraqis could deliver something substantive in return. 
However, a six month delay would \"drive him crazy.\" 
 
3.  (C) Sheinwald raised the idea of a conference aimed at 
getting out the Sunni vote.  The latest he had heard was that 
if a conference took place, it would have to be inside Iraq. 
Sheinwald suggested that the U.S. and UK should encourage 
holding a conference, whether inside or outside Iraq.  DNSA 
Hadley replied that the Jordanians, Saudis, and others 
continued to talk about delaying the elections, but they 
should be focusing on encouraging the Iraqi Sunnis to 
participate. 
 
------------------------ 
Shoring Up the Coalition 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Sheinwald said that the UK was concerned with 
perceptions of the cohesion of the coalition in Iraq.  The 
Dutch are holding firmly to their decision to depart.  DNSA 
Hadley said that the U.S. is dealing with the issue of how to 
shore up the coalition.  The U.S. approached the Ukrainians 
about their deployment, but they begged off, saying it is a 
decision \"for another day.\"  The United States has some funds 
available to assist our allies, if necessary.  While some 
participants in the coalition may decrease their troop levels 
or depart, others may increase their numbers or new countries 
may join.  The numbers are important, but the mix in type of 
deployments is also.  The election results could prompt some 
partners to reconsider earlier decisions. 
 
5.  (C) Sheinwald expressed his surprise that the coalition 
presence had not become an issue in the Iraqi election 
campaign.  The coalition might have to say something publicly 
and it would be better to do so willingly and not be forced 
into a statement.  DNSA Hadley said that the formulation of 
an announcement would have to be very nuanced.  We have 
always said that the U.S. would stay as long as necessary and 
not one day more.  He suggested that we might emphasize the 
second half of that commitment and tie the drawdown of 
coalition forces to the development of the Iraqi security 
services.  Any statement the coalition makes should be 
presented as evidence of success, not an exit.  Sheinwald 
affirmed that the UK does not envision drawing down its 
forces during 2005, a time when the number of Iraqi forces 
will be growing.  This would mean a net increase in troops on 
the ground.  DNSA Hadley noted that General Abizaid has said 
that the Iraqi security services should be in the cities, not 
the coalition.  But the challenge with the Iraqis is the lack 
of leadership and experience.  We have to \"stiffen\" them 
through training.  Sheinwald commented that the Iraqis have 
courage but are unable to feed or transport themselves. 
 
---------------------- 
Case Against Hizballah 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that the Dutch are thinking about 
moving within the EU to have Hizballah listed as a terrorist 
organization.  The United States supports this; Iran and 
terror is on our agenda.  Sheinwald requested that the U.S. 
share with the Netherlands any information it could release 
to help make the case against Hizballah in the EU.  Regarding 
EU negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program, he said that 
the two sides will establish working groups by mid-December. 
He noted, however, that the Iranians are already saying 
unhelpful things about resolving the issue within six months.

Summary

1.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley met with 
Australian Defense Minister Robert Hill December 5 on the 
margins of the IISS Gulf Security Dialogue conference in 
Manama.  Hill said that Australia is staying in the Iraq 
coalition and is looking at how its forces can be more 
useful.  DNSA Hadley suggested that the GOA might alter the 
mission of its troops as a way to reaffirm its commitment. 
Hill noted that he had discussed possible alternatives with 
General Casey in Baghdad, including logistics training, 
leadership/command and control training, force protection for 
the Japanese, and patrolling border areas.  DNSA Hadley 
suggested protecting UN assets in Iraq.  DNSA Hadley 
expressed his concern that the intimidation campaign was 
proving to be a strategic threat.  The coalition should take 
the fight to the enemy and intimidate the intimidators.  Hill 
said it was important that average Iraqis feel that they are 
winners in the political process.  Turning to Asia, Hill said 
that the GOA is working closely with the new administration 
in Indonesia.  DNSA Hadley said that the USG is concerned 
about a possible EU move to lift the ban on arms sales to 
China.  Hill agreed to take this message back to Canberra, 
and said Australia supports U.S. policy on North Korea.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Australia Committed to Iraq Coalition 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Deputy National Security Advisor Hadley opened his 
December 5 meeting with Australian Defense Minister Robert 
Hill by recognizing the difficult and dangerous work the 
United States and Australia carry out together in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.  The relationship between the President, PM 
Howard, and UK PM Blair is very strong.  Hill affirmed that 
Australia is staying in the coalition and stated that the 
government is looking at how its forces in Iraq can be more 
useful.  The troop contribution is small but offers value 
added.  He recognized that the U.S. had made a huge 
investment in Iraq and had paid a heavy price.  He expressed 
his appreciation for the American commitment; if the U.S. was 
not there, \"the place would be chaos.\" 
 
------------------------------------- 
Change in Mission to Maximize Utility 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DNSA Hadley suggested that Australia might want to 
alter the mission of its troops in Iraq so as to reaffirm its 
commitment to the coalition, even if the number of troops did 
not go up.  He noted the perception that the coalition was 
wasting away, and said that the election results may prompt 
other nations to contribute troops.  The IIG has stated that 
it does not want troops coming from neighboring countries, 
but rather wants to focus on training Iraqis.  Hill responded 
that he had met with General Casey in Baghdad a few days 
earlier, who had suggested that, now that the Australia 
contingent had completed training 27 battalions, it could 
work on logistics training.  Hill thought this type of work 
could be useful.  Casey had also proposed that Australia work 
on leadership/command and control training, which Hill 
commented is more complicated.  Hill suggested to Casey that 
Australia could take on supporting the Japanese if the Dutch 
contingent departs, but Casey thought this offers limited 
utility from a military perspective.  Hill noted that it is 
important for Japan to stay in the coalition, and Australia 
could provide the necessary force protection.  Alternatively, 
the Australian troops could help patrol border areas. 
 
4.  (C) DNSA Hadley said that controlling the border is 
important, but in the case of Syria, is not enough.  Syria is 
serving as a mustering point for jihadists to get money, 
training, and equipment.  Shutting down these centers would 
take pressure off controlling the border.  Another issue to 
consider is protecting UN assets in Iraq.  The MNF-I is 
reluctant to take this on because it is less important from 
an operational perspective. 
--------------------------- 
Intimidate the Intimidators 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) DNSA Hadley stated that the intimidation campaign, 
particularly the killing of police, is proving to be a 
strategic threat.  An Iraqi who sides with the coalition, he 
commented, demonstrates a lot of courage.  But the election 
could change the dynamic and make it easier for Iraqis to 
side with the GOI.  Hill responded that the owner of the 
building occupied by the Australian Embassy in Baghdad told 
the Embassy that he wants them to leave the property.  He and 
his family had received threats, and a member of the family 
had been killed.  DNSA Hadley said that the coalition should 
find a way to take the fight to the enemy, to intimidate the 
intimidators.  Hill said it is important that average Iraqis 
feel that they are winners in the political process.  DNSA 
Hadley agreed, and suggested that the IIG find a way to get 
funds for reconstruction projects directly into the hands of 
the property owners, so they can make decisions about how the 
money is spent.  He noted that many Iraqis are hesitant to 
take work on coalition-funded reconstruction  projects 
because of the threats. 
 
------------------- 
Relations with Asia 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Turning to issues closer to home, Hill said that the 
GOA is working closely with the new administration in 
Indonesia, encouraging the government to continue moving in 
the right direction.  DNSA Hadley commented that the 
President had met with the new Indonesian president in Chile, 
and he had made a good impression.  Hill said that southern 
Thailand is not good right now, and the Philippines seems to 
be struggling.  However, Australia now has better relations 
with Malaysia.  Burma continues to move in the wrong 
direction; Australia has tried many policy formulations but 
nothing seems to work.  The Pacific states are strained, 
dealing with a culture clash and bad habits 20 years after 
independence.  DNSA Hadley said that the USG had spoken with 
the Europeans about the proposal to lift the EU ban on arms 
sales to China.  The reaction in Washington would be very 
negative.  The Europeans would sell hardware to China that 
could be used to kill Americans in the area.  Hill promised 
to take this message back to Canberra.  He continued that 
Australia supports what the U.S. wants to do about North 
Korea.  DNSA Hadley said that China is the key - rather than 
trying to be a broker, it should pick a side and lean on the 
North Koreans. 
 
7.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
8.  (C) The NSC cleared this message.

Bahrain 
 
Bahrain has one of the most diversified economies in the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC). Unlike its neighbors, oil accounts 
for only 25 percent of Bahrain\'s gross domestic product 
(GDP). Bahrain has promoted itself as an international 
financial center in the Gulf region. It hosts a mix of 367 
diverse financial institutions, including 187 banks of which 
51 are offshore banking units (OBUs), 37 investment banks, 
and 25 commercial banks, of which 17 are foreign owned. In 
addition, there are 29 representative offices of 
international banks, 21 money changers and money brokers, and 
several other investment institutions, including 84 insurance 
companies. The vast network of its banking system, along with 
its geographical location in the Middle East as a transit 
point along the Gulf and into Southwest Asia, may attract 
money laundering activities. It is thought that the greatest 
risk of money laundering stems from questionable foreign 
proceeds that transit Bahrain. 
 
In January 2001, the Government of Bahrain (GOB) enacted a 
new anti-money laundering law that criminalizes the 
laundering of proceeds derived from any predicate offense. 
The law stipulates punishment of up to seven years in prison, 
and a fine of up to one million dinars ($2.65 million) for 
convicted launderers and those aiding or abetting them. If 
organized criminal affiliation, corruption, or disguise of 
the origin of proceeds is involved, the minimum penalty is a 
fine of at least 100,000 dinars (approximately $265,000) and 
a prison term of not less than five years. 
 
Following enactment of the law, the Bahrain Monetary Agency 
(BMA), as the principal regulator, issued regulations 
requiring financial institutions to file suspicious 
transaction reports (STRs), to maintain records for a period 
of five years, and to provide ready access to account 
information to law enforcement officials. Immunity from 
criminal or civil action is given to those who report 
suspicious transactions. Prior to the enactment of the new 
anti-money laundering law, financial institutions were 
obligated to report suspicious transactions greater than 
6,000 dinars (approximately $15,000) to the BMA.   The 
current requirement for filing STRs has no minimum threshold. 
 Additionally, in early 2005 the BMA is preparing to roll out 
a secure on-line website that banks and financial 
institutions will use to report STRs. 
 
The law also provides for the formation of an interagency 
committee to oversee Bahrain\'s anti-money laundering regime. 
Accordingly, in June 2001, the National Anti-Money Laundering 
Policy Committee was established and assigned the 
responsibility for developing anti-money laundering policies 
and guidelines. The committee, which is under the 
chairmanship of the Undersecretary of Finance and National 
Economy, includes members from the BMA, the Bahrain Stock 
Exchange, and the Ministries of Finance and National Economy, 
Interior, Justice, Commerce, Labor and Social Affairs, and 
Foreign Affairs. The law further provides additional powers 
of confiscation and allows for better international 
cooperation. 
 
The law also provides for the creation of a financial 
intelligence unit (FIU), known as the Anti-Money Laundering 
Unit (AMLU), which is housed in the Ministry of Interior. 
AMLU is empowered to receive reports of money laundering 
offenses; conduct investigations; implement procedures 
relating to international cooperation under the provisions of 
the law; and execute decisions, orders, and decrees issued by 
the competent courts in offenses related to money laundering. 
Bahrain\'s AMLU was granted membership into the Egmont Group 
of FIUs in July 2003. 
 
The AMLU receives suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from 
banks and other financial institutions, investment houses, 
broker/dealers, money changers, insurance firms, real estate 
agents, gold dealers, financial intermediaries, and 
attorneys. Financial institutions must also file STRs with 
the BMA, which supervises these institutions. The AMLU and 
the BMA\'s Compliance Unit analyze the STRs and work together 
on identifying weaknesses or criminal activity, but the AMLU 
must conduct the actual investigation and forward cases of 
money-laundering and terrorism financing to the public 
prosecutor. 
 
There are 51 BMA-licensed offshore banking units (OBUs) that 
are branches of international commercial banks. OBUs are 
prohibited from accepting deposits from citizens and 
residents of Bahrain, and from undertaking transactions in 
Bahraini dinars (with certain exemptions, such as dealings 
with other banks and government agencies). In all other 
respects, OBUs are regulated and supervised in the same way 
as the domestic banking sector. They are subject to the same 
regulations, on-site examination procedures, and external 
audit and regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
Bahrain law permits the formation of offshore resident 
companies and offshore nonresident companies that are formed 
as international business companies (IBCs). Resident 
companies must have an office in Bahrain, a minimum capital 
of $54,000, and a license from the BMA to conduct financial 
activities. All IBCs that conduct insurance-related business 
in Bahrain are subject to supervision of the BMA. 
 
In November 2001, Bahrain signed the UN International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 
The Bahraini Parliament ratified the Convention in December 
2003 and issued implementing regulations in June 2004.  The 
BMA in January 2002 issued a circular implementing the FATF 
Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as part 
of the BMA\'s AML regulations, and subsequently froze two 
accounts designated by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee and 
one account listed under U.S. Executive Order 13224.  The BMA 
is drafting the circular to implement the newest FATF special 
recommendation #9 on cash couriers - a final ruling should be 
out in early 2005. 
 
BMA Circular BC/1/2002 states that money changers may not 
transfer funds for customers in another country by any means 
other than Bahrain\'s banking system, under penalty of legal 
sanctions. In addition, all BMA licensees are required to 
include details of the originator\'s information with all 
outbound transfers. With respect to incoming transfers, 
licensees are required to maintain records of all originator 
information and to carefully scrutinize inward transfers that 
do not contain the originator\'s information, as they are 
presumed to be suspicious transactions. Licensees that 
suspect, or have reasonable grounds to suspect, that funds 
are linked or related to suspicious activities, including 
terrorist financing, are required to file suspicious 
transaction reports (STRs). Licensees must maintain records 
of the identity of their customers in accordance with the 
BMA\'s money laundering regulations, as well as the exact 
amount of transfers. 
 
Decree No. 21 of 1989 governs the licensing of nonprofit 
organizations. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs 
(MLSA) is responsible for licensing and supervising charity 
organizations in Bahrain. As part of its efforts to 
strengthen the regulatory environment and fight potential 
terrorist financing, MLSA issued a ministerial order in 
February 2004 regulating the collection of donated funds 
through charities and their eventual distribution to help 
confirm the charities, humanitarian objectives. The 
regulations are aimed at tracking money that is entering and 
leaving the country. The new regulations require 
organizations to keep records of sources and uses of 
financial resources, organizational structure, and 
membership. Charitable societies are required to deposit 
their funds with banks located in Bahrain and may only have 
one account in one bank.   Banks must report to the BMA any 
transaction by a charitable institution that exceeds 20,000 
dinars. MLSA has the right to inspect records of the 
societies to insure their compliance with the law. 
 
Bahrain is a leading Islamic finance center in the region. 
The sector has grown considerably since the licensing of the 
first Islamic bank in 1979. Bahrain has 28 Islamic banks and 
financial institutions. Given the large share of such 
institutions in Bahrain\'s banking community, the BMA is 
working to create an appropriate framework for regulating and 
supervising the Islamic banking sector, applying regulations 
and supervision as it does with respect to conventional 
banks. In March 2002, the BMA introduced a comprehensive set 
of regulations for Islamic banks called the Prudential 
Information and Regulatory Framework for Islamic Banks 
(PIRI). The framework was designed to monitor certain banking 
aspects, such as capital requirements, governance, control 
systems, and regulatory reporting. 
In November 2004 Bahrain hosted the inaugural meeting of the 
Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force 
(MENA FATF).  Bahrain worked hard over the last few years to 
start this body and to host it in Manama.  There was an 
initial planning meeting in January 2004 in Manama and the 
FATF unanimously endorsed the MENA FATF proposal in July 
2004.  Bahrain\'s leadership was instrumental in the 
establishment of this regional body. 
Bahrain has demonstrated a commitment to put in place a 
strong anti-money laundering regime and is determined to 
engage its large financial sector in this effort. The 
government should follow through by aggressively enforcing 
the law and developing and prosecuting anti-money laundering 
cases. Its officials have attended and should continue to 
attend orientation and training sessions in Bahrain and 
international locations. The AMLU should continue with its 
efforts to gain the necessary expertise in tracking 
suspicious transactions and in investigating and initiating 
investigations in money laundering offenses.

1.  (C) Summary.  On a December 12-13 visit to Manama, NEA 
DAS Dibble paid a call on Bahraini Minister of National 
Economy (MOFNE) Abdulla Saif.  They discussed the 
U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the recent Forum for 
the Future meeting in Rabat, and plans for the establishment 
of the Entrepreneurship Center.  Saif stated that despite 
pressure from the Saudis, Bahrain is committed to moving 
forward with the FTA, and that the dispute over FTAs would be 
resolved by the GCC summit.  He was also positive about the 
recent meetings in Rabat and indicated Bahrain would host the 
next round in November 2005.  Concerning the MEPI initiative 
to create and staff an entrepreneurship center, Saif 
mentioned that the GOB is committed to this project, but 
needs to clarify funding issues.  End Summary. 
 
FTA Going Forward 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) NEA DAS Dibble opened his December 13 meeting with 
MOFNE Saif by asking about Saudi Arabia\'s recent negative 
reaction to Bahrain\'s FTA.  Saif stressed GOB commitment to 
the agreement and expressed optimism that a formula will be 
reached to resolve the issue at the GCC Finance Minister\'s 
meeting in Manama December 18 in advance of the December 20 
GCC summit.  When asked about Bahrain\'s ratification plans, 
Saif said the Cabinet had passed the file to the Council of 
Representatives, and it is well on the way to ratification. 
He revealed tentative plans for another FTA roadshow in 
Chicago next April.  He stated that while Bahrain\'s 
\"fast-track\" approach to FTA negotiations is a model for 
other GCC nations, he recognized that the GCC countries are 
at different stages of readiness for FTA.  He is hopeful that 
the U.S. will be able to have an agreement with all GCC 
members in the future. 
 
Forum for the Future 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Minister Saif declared the Forum for the Future in 
Rabat a success.  He indicated that Bahrain submitted several 
papers including one on the Entrepreneurship Center and 
another on the Network of Funds.  He also had a productive 
meeting with Treasury Secretary Snow in which they discussed 
terrorism financing.  He stated Bahrain is taking a lead on 
this issue and will host the MENA FATF.  He also mentioned 
that the Forum accepted Bahrain\'s offer to host the next 
Forum for the Future meeting in November 2005. 
 
Entrepreneurship Center 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Minister Saif indicated that Bahrain is willing to 
move forward on the MEPI-initiated Entrepreneurship Center, 
however questions still remain regarding payment for the 
building and staff salaries.  In the short-term the Bahrain 
Institute for Banking and Finance can house the Center, but 
there must be a permanent facility developed. In the 
meantime, the consultants for the center (Beyster Institute) 
will return in January and expect to launch their first 
training program by April 2005.

TAGS: PREL, ETRD, BA, GCC 
SUBJECT: GCC MANAMA SUMMIT CONCLUDES UNDER SHADOW OF 
BAHRAIN FTA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William T. Monroe.  Reason: 1.4 (B)(D) 
 
1. (C)  Saudi Arabia\'s concern about bilateral free trade 
agreements with the United States overshadowed the 25th GCC 
Summit, which took place in Bahrain December 20-21.  The last 
minute downgrading of Saudi\'s representation from Crown 
Prince Abdulla to Prince Sultan set the tone at the beginning 
of the conclave (presumed to be an expression of displeasure 
aimed at Bahrain), and the question of how far the Saudis 
would push the free trade issue weighed heavily on the 
proceedings.  Although we will have to wait a day for an 
authoritative briefings, it appears that the Summit leaders 
may have sidestepped the FTA issue.  The communique said only 
that \"in reference to the economic relations of the GCC 
states with the international community, the Council took 
note of developments that took place in 2004 and the 
agreements that were signed to establish free trade areas.\" 
Finance Minister Seif and MFA MinState Abdel Ghaffar both 
assured the Ambassador that the Summit did nothing to keep 
Bahrain from moving forward on the MFA, although Abdel 
Ghaffar suggested that discussions on the issue were 
\"complicated.\"  An official connected with the UAE delegation 
told us that it was his understanding that the FTA issue was 
referred to a technical subcommittee for further discussion. 
 
2. (U) In his public comments to the press December 20, Abdel 
Ghaffar strongly defended Bahrain\'s position on the FTA, 
saying that Bahrain was not breaking GCC ranks. 
\"Globalization,\" he said, \"leads to a free economy and free 
trade agreements.  Regulations hinder such steps.  The Gulf 
region needs a flexible set of regulations.\"  He also said 
that suspending the GCC customs union was not in the cards. 
 
3. (U) Other issues discussed in the communique (informal 
Embassy translation) included: 
 
-- Iraq: The communique expressed hope that the U.S. 
administration would actively work with the UN and the 
international community to enable all factions to participate 
in the political process through elections that could lead 
the Iraqi people to draw its own political and economic 
future; condemned terrorist attacks targeting civilians and 
humanitarian and religious institutions; and stressed the 
importance of halting interference in Iraq\'s internal affairs. 
 
-- Jeddah consulate: The Council condemned the terrorist 
attack on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah. 
 
-- Iran: The Council expressed its support of the UAE\'s right 
of sovereignty over the three islands, and its regret that 
talks with Iran have not achieved positive results.   (The 
Bahrain press had indicated that the communique would also 
praise Iran for signing the agreement to freeze all 
activities related to uranium enrichment, but that item was 
apparently either dropped or not in the text in the first 
place.) 
 
-- Middle East peace: The Council hoped that President Bush 
would devote attention, during his second term, to the Middle 
East cause in a manner that would meet the promises of a 
Palestinian state that lives in peace and security side by 
side with the state of Israel.  It hoped that the Quartet 
Commission would continue its efforts to move the peace 
process forwarding the Middle East. 
 
-- terrorism: The Council reiterated its condemnation of all 
forms of terrorism everywhere, stressing the GCC countries\' 
commitment to the principle of combating terrorism and 
stopping the financial sources that fund terrorism by all 
available means.  It also stressed the importance of 
discriminating between terrorism and peoples\' legitimate 
right to resist occupation according to international 
resolutions. 
 
-- WMD: The Council demanded that the international community 
work towards making the Middle East a region free of weapons 
of mass destruction, including the Gulf region. 
 
-- Democratic reform: the Council reiterated its commitment 
to continue the political, economic and social development 
process in the region, and reaffirmed that modernization and 
improvement must come from within the countries of the 
region....  The Council stressed the importance of gradual

1. (C) As expected, Bahrain\'s Criminal Court decided on 
December 20 to temporarily suspend its hearing on the case 
against four terrorist suspects, pending a decision by 
Constitutional Court on the constitutionality of article 157 
of the penal code under which the four are charged.  The 
decision was a formality once the suspects\' defense lawyers 
demonstrated to the Criminal Court judge that the 
Constitutional Court had accepted the case.  The head of the 
Constitutional Court told the Ambassador December 21 that he 
has five cases already on his docket, and he expects the case 
to be heard in the next two to three months.  In the 
meantime, the suspects remain under surveillance. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador on December 20 discussed the 
constitutional case with the President of the Court of 
Cassation (Supreme Court) Shaikh Khalifa bin Rashid Al 
Khalifa, who said that the question of the constitutionality 
of the case is not frivolous.  He said that the courts in 
Cairo had considered a similar law in a criminal case, and 
viewed it unconstitutional, while in Kuwait the 
constitutionality of the law had been upheld.  Basically, he 
said, the law punishes people who are involved in the 
planning of a crime, whether or not they actual carry out the 
plan.  In purely criminal cases, he said, that can be 
problematic, especially in terms of the evidence.  He 
acknowledged that planning for a terrorist crime is something 
different, and is something that countries -- not just 
Bahrain -- are currently grappling with.

1.   (U) The Bahraini reaction to the highly successful 
visit of former Georgetown University Basketball players 
Omari Faulkner and Courtland Freeman was summed up by the 
Bahrain\'s National Basketball Team coach: \"More sports 
programs are needed to foster greater dialogue.\" The two 
Cultural Envoys did a masterful job in engaging with a 
young Bahraini audience, GoB Officials, and Bahraini 
teachers and coaches by using basketball as a common 
language. During their November 29 - December 2 visit to 
Bahrain, the Cultural Envoys were hosted by the President 
of the Bahrain Basketball Association, who told APAO that 
a visit like this is \"long overdue and something that 
must continue.\" 
 
2.    (U) Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Freeman were a \"dream 
team\" as cultural envoys with natural ability to connect 
with others. Among a younger audience they spoke about 
the value of sports in building determination, instilling 
a spirit of teamwork, and breaking down cultural 
barriers. The two visitors led practices with teams of 
teenagers at several athletic clubs. At the Muharraq 
Club, one of Bahrain\'s largest sports clubs, the young 
players refused to leave the practice hall and pleaded 
with their parents to watch them play with their \"new 
American friends.\" 
3.   (U) The cultural envoys discussed their experience 
as students and players at a NCAA Division I University 
and encouraged Bahrainis to apply for Post\'s exchange 
opportunities to study at universities in the U.S. The 
players participated in drills and scrimmages with the 
Bahrain National Basketball Team.  The coach excitedly 
stated, \"this is what we aim for, basketball players of 
all cultures enjoying a common passion for sports 
together.\" 
 
4.   (U) The Cultural Envoys received wide media 
coverage.  Articles about their events appeared in both 
the Arabic and English daily newspapers.  One Arabic 
newspaper called the visit a new opportunity for cultural 
dialogue with sports as the common language.  In 
addition, a profile of the athletes and their experience 
in Bahrain will be featured in the upcoming edition of 
Bahrain\'s \"Confidential Magazine.\"  The players also 
participated in a live interview with Radio Bahrain, 
which targets a young audience. 
 
5.   (U) COMMENT: Post strongly encourages more cultural 
sports programs. This event was a large success due to 
the charisma, professionalism, and interpersonal skills 
of Mr. Freeman and Mr. Faulkner and because of the power 
of sports to reach beyond cultural and political 
barriers.  At a time when U.S. policies face challenges, 
the common interest in the ideals of teamwork, 
dedication, and sacrifice involved in athletics and the 
\"appreciation for the game\" offers a common ground. The 
principal of a secondary school told the PAO, \"these are 
the types of programs that can rebuild what terrorism has 
tried to destroy.\" END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary.  Bahrain MFA Minister of State Abdel Ghaffar 
termed the 25th GCC Summit a \"very good and successful 
event,\" citing the conclusion several economic agreements 
aimed at mobility and integration within the GCC as well as 
the Summit\'s success in sidestepping Saudi concerns over 
FTAs.  He confirmed that the FTA issue was deferred to the 
ministerial-level economic and finance committee.  All GCC 
countries (except Saudi Arabia) reaffirmed their 
determination to press forward with FTAs.  The Summit also 
produced a \"Manama Declaration,\" a Bahrain initiative aimed 
at highlighting GCC support for continued reform (referencing 
the Forum for the Future).  The GCC established a new 
secretariat position to help coordinate counterterrorism 
 
SIPDIS 
efforts.  Abdel Ghaffar highlighted the GCC\'s support for the 
upcoming elections in Iraq, and a desire to be helpful in 
pushing Palestinians and Israelis to the negotiating table. 
End summary. 
 
2. (C) Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Abdel 
Ghaffar, in a December 22 briefing to non-Arab Ambassadors 
and separately to the Ambassador, gave an upbeat assessment 
of the just concluded 25th GCC Summit, calling it a \"very 
good and successful\" event.  Noting that observers had feared 
that the Bahrain FTA disagreement with Saudi Arabia would 
topple the Summit, he called the overcoming of that hurdle a 
success in itself.  In terms of practical accomplishments, he 
cited 11 economic-related agreements, pointing out that at 
one point there were indications the Saudis would defer 
discussion on all economic issues because of the FTA dispute. 
 
3. (C) On the FTA, Abdel Ghaffar confirmed that, in the end, 
the Summit neatly sidestepped the issue by referring it to 
the ministerial-level economic and finance committee without 
giving a timetable.  He said that the Saudis had continued to 
press on the issue during the December 18 Finance Ministers 
meeting, but by the Foreign Ministers meeting the next day 
they seemed to have stepped back, agreeing that if there was 
no consensus it could be referred to the committee for 
further study and discussion.  Abdel Ghaffar said that the 
other four GCC countries made perfectly clear their intention 
to proceed with plans to pursue FTAs with the U.S.  He was 
not expecting the committee to take any measure that would 
block this. 
 
4. (C) Abdel Ghaffar acknowledged that the Bahrainis were 
bothered and puzzled by the Saudi tactics on the FTA.  Why, 
they wondered, did Prince Saud raise it publicly at an 
international forum (the December 5-6 IISS conference) rather 
than wait two weeks and raise it privately at the GCC Finance 
Ministers meeting on December 18?  Bahrain\'s conclusion: the 
Saudi message was aimed primarily at the U.S.  If true, he 
said, this is in a way a positive message.  Saudi Arabia, 
watching its GCC neighbors move forward on FTAs, wants U.S. 
help in speeding up its WTO accession.  He said that he did 
not think Bahrain\'s relationship with Saudi Arabia, which he 
called close, deep, and historically interconnected, would be 
harmed by the dispute over the FTA.  \"The Saudis want to get 
into the WTO,\" he added, \"and we hope they will.\" 
 
5. (U) Among the economic-related agreements reached at the 
Summit, Abdel Ghaffar cited the following: 
 
-- a social insurance scheme that allows GCC citizens working 
in other countries to continue to receive their insurance 
coverage from their own country.  In his press conference 
following the Summit, Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammed called 
this \"one of the most important achievements of the Summit\" 
as it would further facilitate movement of GCC citizens 
within the GCC.  Previously, GCC citizens who moved to 
another country lost the right to receive social insurance 
from their own country, a disincentive for labor mobility. 
 
-- a unified ID card (called \"smart card\") for all CC 
citizens, also designed to ease the movement of citizens 
within the GCC.  Under this scheme, data such as drivers 
license, passport, health information, and ID information 
will be retrievable electronically from the card in any GCC 
state. 
 
-- a GCC railway network to strengthen transport ties between 
GCC countries. 
 
-- a unified industrial law designed to increase cooperation, 
joint ventures, and productivity in industry. 
 
-- a decision to draft a joint study on the issue of 
expatriate labor. 
 
6. (U) Abdel Ghaffar also highlighted the \"Manama 
Declaration,\" issued separately from the Summit communique 
and described by Abdel Ghaffar as the first declaration 
issued by the GCC on the question of reform and 
modernization.   He said that this was a Bahraini initiative, 
designed to show the world that the GCC gives great 
importance to reform.  In the short, four-paragraph document, 
the GCC countries highlight their determination to continue 
their work on modernization; reiterate that true democracy 
cannot be imported but stems from within the history and 
heritage of the GCC countries; and welcome Bahrain\'s 
invitation to host the next meeting of the Forum of the 
Future in the context of reinforcing concepts of 
modernization and reform. 
 
7. (C) On international issues, Abdel Ghaffar said that the 
GCC leaders hoped that the U.S. and Europe would become more 
active on the Middle East peace process.  He said the GCC was 
keen to contribute in any way to help pave the way for new 
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.  \"It is a 
time when hope is rising,\" he said, \"although continuing 
violence saddens us.\"  On Iraq, he said the GCC wanted to 
convey a message of support for the upcoming elections.  He 
said that while the communique did not specifically mention 
holding the elections as scheduled on January 30, the leaders 
did believe that it important to keep to that date.  There is 
no guarantee, he said, that slipping the date three or six 
months will create a better result. 
 
8. (C) Abdul Ghaffar also highlighted the Summit\'s decision 
to create a new position at the GCC Secretariat -- assistant 
secretary for security.  The aim is to help the GCC secretary 
 
SIPDIS 
general coordinate GCC counterterrorism efforts.  Terrorism 
was one of the most important issues discussed at the Summit, 
he said, and GCC countries are \"very serious about fighting 
terrorism.\"   Citing the recent attack on the U.S. consulate 
in Jeddah, he said that GCC countries have been the targets 
of terrorism and need to work together on this issue.

Bahrain 
 
Bahrain is providing important support to our 
counterterrorism efforts, particularly efforts to block the 
financing of terror groups. Bahrain has continued to respond 
positively to requests for assistance to combat terror 
financing; it has frozen about $18 million in 
terrorist-linked funds.  In November 2004, Bahrain hosted the 
inaugural meeting of the Middle East and North Africa 
Financial Action Task Force (MENA FATF).  Bahrain worked 
closely with FATF for several years to establish this 
regional body.  Located in Bahrain, the new MENA FATF 
secretariat will promote the FATF 40 and 9 Special 
 
SIPDIS 
Recommendations to combat money laundering and terrorist 
financing. 
 
Through hosting the U.S. Navy\'s Fifth Fleet and other 
activities, Bahrain contributes to coalition operations in 
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Bahrain is an eager participant in the U.S. Government\'s 
Anti-Terrorism Assistance programs.  Bahrain continued to 
provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation.  In 
2004, Bahrain arrested, released, and re-arrested a group of 
terrorist suspects.  The court released them for the period 
of the trial, which is ongoing. 
 
- In June, the Government of Bahrain arrested six Bahrainis 
and placed one Bahraini under house arrest on suspicion of 
plotting terrorist attacks.  All seven were released within 
two days. 
 
- The Government of Bahrain re-arrested the six individuals 
in mid-July.  The court ordered the release of two in 
mid-September and ordered the release of the remaining four 
in early November pending trial. 
 
- Preliminary hearings for the case began in early December. 
The court referred to the Constitutional Court a motion 
contesting the constitutionality of the charges against the 
suspects. 
 
- One of the four escaped the courtroom during a hearing in 
mid-September and was re-captured the same day.  He was 
convicted in mid-November and is serving a six-month sentence. 
 
Bahrain\'s lack of a domestic conspiracy law hampers its 
ability to intervene against suspected extremist plots. This 
could encourage terrorists to value Bahrain as a potential 
logistic haven.  The Government is developing a draft 
amendment to the penal code addressing conspiracy to commit 
terrorist acts. 
 
Bahrain is a party to seven of the 12 international 
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism and is a 
signatory to the Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism.

be a model FTA, the agreement contains broad commitments to 
open services markets.  Bahrain will accord substantial 
market access across its entire services regime, providing

negotiated to date.  Key services sectors covered by the 
agreement include audiovisual, express delivery, 
telecommunications, computer and related services,

1.  (C) Bahrainis disregarded London-based Saudi dissident 
Dr. Saad Al Faqih\'s call for protests against the Saudi 
Arabian government following Friday prayers December 31. 
While police stood by, worshippers departed the Al Fateh 
Grand Mosque compound in a normal fashion.  Al Faqih\'s appeal 
provoked a backlash of opposition from leading Bahrainis in 
the fields of religion, politics, and media.  They sounded 
common themes of promoting unity, peaceful relations, and 
non-interference in internal affairs and condemned Al Faqih\'s 
move as evil.  Bahrain\'s Salafis, presumably the target of Al 
Faqih\'s call, are influential in Bahrain due to their 
prominent position inside the parliament\'s Council of 
Representatives, and would only jeopardize their position by 
taking on Bahrain\'s largest, most important neighbor.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
They Gave a Protest and Nobody Came 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) London-based Saudi dissident Dr. Saad Al Faqih\'s 
call for demonstrations against the Saudi government at 
Manama\'s Al Fateh Grand Mosque following Friday prayers went 
unanswered December 31.  Al Faqih had urged Bahrainis to 
stage mass demonstrations against Saudi Arabia in broadcasts 
on the dissident\'s Al Islah satellite channel. 
 
3.  (C) RSO confirmed that the Interior Ministry deployed 
some 30 police officers to the Grand Mosque Friday to control 
any protests.  Eyewitnesses reported that worshippers 
dispersed following the prayers in a normal fashion. 
 
---------------------------- 
Imam Condemns Call As \"Evil\" 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Bahrain\'s religious and political leaders were 
united in condemning Al Faqih\'s call.  Imam of the Grand 
Mosque Shaikh Adnan Al Qattan addressed the issue in his 
sermon, saying that the call was evil aimed at fomenting 
disorder, hostility and disputes among Muslim states.  He 
said that Islamic values guide Muslims to observe good ties 
with neighbors, not intervene in others\' internal affairs and 
to respect national sovereignty.  He warned citizens against 
responding to the call, which could lead to serious 
consequences and harm the country\'s unity and please the 
enemies of Islam.  He called on the security services to ban 
any demonstrations. 
 
------------------------------- 
Politicians Warn Against Action 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Head of the Salafi political bloc Al Asala and 
Second Deputy Chairman of the parliament\'s lower house 
(Council of Representatives - COR) Shaikh Adel Al Moawda 
publicly condemned the call and said that demonstrations 
would harm unity in society and encourage the enemies of 
Islam to act against Muslims.  Protests and rallies are not 
the proper way to bring about reforms, he added. 
Spokesperson for the Salafi bloc, Ghanem Al Boanain, stated 
that reform should be achieved gradually through peace rather 
than violence.  He added that King Hamad set an example to be 
followed regarding reform, opening channels for dialogue and 
new ideas. 
 
6.  (SBU) President of (Muslim Brotherhood affiliated) Al 
Minbar National Islamic Society and head of the Minbar 
parliamentary bloc Dr. Salah Ali said that the call for 
protests contradicts Islamic teachings.  He added that 
targeting Saudi Arabia crosses red lines and directly targets 
the security of the GCC.  He continued that protests would 
increase the already existing pressure on Muslims at a time 
when \"Islam is targeted.\"  He urged Arab and Islamic 
governments to reach out to their citizens and open channels 
of communication on national issues. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Journalists Caution Against Interference 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Al Wasat newspaper Editor in Chief Mansour Al Jamri 
in a January 2 column rejected Al Faqih\'s call, describing it 
as unwise and unacceptable.  He wrote, \"our hope is that 
dialogue is reinforced between Gulf countries without the 
need to resort to incitement...  We in Bahrain do not call on 
anybody in other countries to demonstrate on our behalf and 
we do not expect others to become involved in Bahrain\'s 
internal affairs.\"  Akhbar Al Khaleej newspaper columnist 
Abdul Menem Ibrahim wrote, \"the call of radical Saudis to 
demonstrate in Bahrain against Saudi Arabia was a call that 
revealed their true backwardness.  They think that political 
freedoms in Bahrain give them the right to use Bahrain for 
their activities, but they are wrong.  Democracy is not 
interfering in others\' affairs or disrespecting brotherly 
relations with neighboring countries.  Bahrain\'s democracy is 
for Bahrainis.\" 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Al Faqih presumably was appealing to Bahrain\'s Salafi 
community in his call for protests against Saudi Arabia.  If 
he was expecting support, he badly miscalculated.  Bahraini 
Salafis and other Sunni conservatives are doing quite well 
within the system, representing a well-entrenched group in 
the Council of Representatives.  They would only jeopardize 
their position by supporting calls for interference in Saudi 
Arabia.  Bahrain\'s Shia will always be suspicious of the 
intentions of Sunni fundamentalists.  Other interest groups 
in Bahraini society, particularly the government and business 
community, are looking for ways to mend relations with the 
Saudi government following month-long tensions stemming from 
Saudi Arabia\'s implicit criticism of the U.S.-Bahrain free 
trade agreement.  As a result, Al Faqih did not stand a 
chance.

counseling and rehabilitating victims; and supporting 
legislation to protect workers\' rights.  Society board 
members also said they would open a shelter for abused 
migrant workers.  Last year the GOB promised to help the MWG 
in this effort and named a site for the shelter.  According 
to MOLSA Director of Labor Relations Sheikh Ali Al Khalifa, 
preparations are complete and the shelter lacks only the 
GOB\'s approval to begin providing services.  Sheikh Ali 
expects approval in the coming months. 
 
3.  (C)  Comment:  The GOB\'s registration of the Migrant 
Workers Protection Society demonstrates recognition within 
some quarters of the government that the BCHR contributed 
positively to society in certain areas, even sensitive ones 
such as the mistreatment of foreign workers.  Unfortunately, 
this recognition is not spilling over into broader acceptance 
of the BCHR; a court case filed by the BCHR demanding the 
re-opening of the center is still in the courts, and former 
members despair that it may really be closed permanently.  We 
continue to advocate for the re-opening of the center, and 
await resumption of the court case on January 16.

heavily in a January 4 meeting the Ambassador held with 
Minister of Defense Gen. Khalifa Al-Khalifa. 
 
2. (C) Both Abdel Ghaffar and Gen. Khalifa, in addition to 
dwelling on long-standing fears about excessive Iranian 
influence in the elections, queried the Ambassador on a 
statement by Iraq Defense Minister Hazem Shaalan in Cairo, 
prominently reported in the local press, which raised the 
possibility of postponing the elections.  According to this 
report, Shaalan told reporters that he has asked Egypt and 
Gulf countries to try to persuade Sunnis to participate in 
the election.  \"And if they agreed,\" he said, \"then we could 
postpone the date to let all Iraqis go to the polls in one 
day.\"  To both Ministers, Ambassador stressed that there was

was no evidence of any Sunnis coming forward to say that they 
would participate if there were a delay in the elections. 
 
3. (C) Abdel Ghaffar stated that DPM/FM Sheik Mohammed 
Al-Khalifa would represent Bahrain at the Iraq Neighbors 
Conference in Amman, and that Abdel Ghaffar would represent 
Bahrain at the Arab League meeting.  He said that at these 
meetings Bahrain would maintain its support for the elections 
and stability in Iraq, while opposing Iranian influence 
there.  On that latter point, he (and Defense Minister 
Khalifa) went on at some length, raising concerns, for 
example, that Iranian agents had completely infiltrated Iraqi 
intelligence services in southern Iraq and flooded the region 
with Iranian-based voters.  Asked what the Bahraini 
leadership thought of the relatively moderate message SCIRI\'s 
Abdel Aziz Al Hakim brought during his recent visit to 
Bahrain, Abdel Ghaffar acknowledged that his message was 
indeed moderate but that he did not like the idea of clerical 
leadership ruling Iraq. 
 
4. (C) Comment: While fully supportive of our policy on Iraq, 
including the need to move forward with elections, Bahrain 
would be sympathetic to a delay in the elections if that 
would help check post-election Iranian influence in Iraq.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) King Hamad, in a January 3 meeting with the 
Ambassador, expressed his appreciation for his November 29 
meeting with the President and reaffirmed Bahrain\'s 
friendship with the United States.  The Ambassador thanked 
the King for the GOB\'s continued surveillance of the four 
terrorist suspects and urged the government to pursue a 
vigorous prosecution.  The King recounted his visit with 
Saudi Crown Prince Abdulla shortly after the December 20-21 
GCC Summit, saying he was not happy with Saudi Arabia\'s 
\"unusual behavior\" towards Bahrain.  The King voiced his 
opinion that CP Abdulla believes the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA) and FTA negotiations with other Gulf States 
could lead to the break-up of the GCC.  The King said that 
Saudi Arabia did not like direct contact between other GCC 
members.  He explained that after spending $700 million to 
expand production of the joint Bahraini-Saudi Abu Saafa 
field, Bahrain was actually receiving less oil from Saudi 
Arabia than before.  He noted that FTA ratification was on 
track in the Bahraini parliament, and expressed his 
confidence that Bahrain\'s Shia would participate in elections 
in 2005 and 2006.  The King hoped that the President would 
make a push on the roadmap following Palestinian elections. 
End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Grateful for Meeting with President 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) King Hamad told the Ambassador January 3 that he was 
happy to have met with the President so soon after the U.S. 
election, saying that Bahrain is a small country but it plays 
a big role in the region.  He said that Bahrain is proud of 
its friendship with the United States and has been with the 
U.S. \"from the beginning.\"  The U.S. role in the region has 
been very positive:  the U.S. freed Iraq and deters Iran. 
The King complimented the Ambassador on his interview that 
appeared in the December 29 edition of the Bahrain Tribune 
and Al Ayam newspapers. 
 
------------------------------- 
Joint Counter-Terrorism Efforts 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador raised our joint counter-terrorism 
efforts, stating that the U.S. appreciates continued Bahraini 
surveillance of the four terrorist suspects currently on 
trial.  The United States, the Ambassador continued, wants 
the GOB to pursue the prosecution energetically.  The King 
replied that Minister of Interior Shaikh Rashed bin Abdulla 
Al Khalifa is close to him and is doing well.  Shaikh 
Rashed\'s goal is to develop a relationship between the MOI 
and the United States that is as close as the relationship 
between the Ministry of Defense and the U.S.  The Ambassador 
responded that the USG is supporting Shaikh Rashed\'s efforts. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Saudi Arabia\'s \"Unusual Behavior\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The Ambassador praised the King for his handling of 
the December 20-21 GCC Summit in Manama, and asked the King 
for his thoughts on Saudi Arabia.  The King replied that he 
had visited Crown Prince Abdulla shortly after the summit. 
He said that Bahrain had always provided counsel to Saudi 
Arabia, from the time of Ibn Saud, and Bahrainis are the only 
people who are honest with the Saudis.  He reported that he 
told CP Abdulla that he was not happy with Saudi Arabia\'s 
\"unusual behavior\" at the GCC Summit.  Saudi Arabia is the 
backbone of the GCC, and by not participating, something 
could go wrong.  The King told CP Abdulla that Saudi Arabia 
will not get what it wants from the world because of the way 
the SAG runs the country.  Saudi Arabia needs the Gulf States 
as an outlet to the world.  Saudi Arabia relies on Bahrain 
for much of its banking and insurance requirements, and Dubai 
is the destination for Saudi investments in construction and 
real estate. 
 
5.  (C) The King said that he told CP Abdulla that the United 
States appreciates what Saudi Arabia is doing in the fight 
against terrorism, but Saudi Arabia should be more forward 
leaning in explaining its views.  President Bush is a friend 
of Saudi Arabia, and the SAG should \"help him help you.\"  The 
King commented that CP Abdulla is a national guardsman, not a 
politician or economist, and he does not know how to use the 
media to his advantage. 
 
------------------------ 
Saudi Concern About FTAs 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) The King continued that CP Abdulla believes that the 
U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and FTA negotiations 
with other Gulf countries could lead the GCC to break-up. 
The King related that he told CP Abdulla that all GCC 
countries are now members of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) except Saudi Arabia, and the SAG did not complain when 
they joined the WTO, so why now be worried about FTAs?  The 
Ambassador noted that U.S. officials had briefed Saudi Arabia 
on our FTA plans before announcing our intention to negotiate 
with Bahrain, and the Saudis had not objected. 
 
7.  (C) The King said that he told CP Abdulla that whoever 
was advising him regarding FTAs was not a friend of the 
United States.  The Gulf States are independent and benefit 
from their relationships with the U.S., and Saudi Arabia 
should do the same.  The King asked CP Abdulla how Saudi 
Arabia would market its Jubail industrial complexes if it did 
not promote trade with the U.S. and others.  Saudi Arabia, 
the King continued, is jealous of Bahrain\'s relationship with 
the United States.  It also views Bahrain\'s improved 
relations with Qatar, and talk of development of a causeway 
linking the two countries, as cutting Saudi Arabia out of the 
picture.  Saudi Arabia does not like direct contact between 
the Gulf States; it prefers to be the broker.  The King 
stated that he had met with Qatari Emir Hamad and joked that 
the two countries previously had to fight over Hawar Island, 
but now that this was settled, there should be no border 
between them. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Saudi Cold Shoulder in Washington 
--------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The King told the Ambassador that neither Saudi 
Prince Bandar nor any other representative of the Saudi 
Embassy had met him upon his arrival in the United States, 
whereas all the other Arab embassies were present.  He met 
later with Bandar, who told the King that he was \"the most 
frustrated man in the world.\"  He is welcomed by the White 
House, but he does not have guidance on how to respond when 
the President asks him questions.  The King commented that 
the Saudi leadership is tough in fighting terrorism but does 
not see the global picture or how to engage internationally. 
 
------------------ 
Bahrain\'s Oil Woes 
------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Turning the discussion to petroleum, the King said 
that Saudi Arabia is playing a role in stopping inter-GCC 
trade.  Qatar wants to export natural gas to Bahrain and 
Kuwait, but Saudi Arabia will not give approval for a 
pipeline to go through its territory.  The King said that he 
complained to CP Abdulla that Saudi Arabia had cut off a 50 
thousand barrel per day (bpd) allotment that it had given to 
Bahrain for five years against Bahrain\'s share of the Abu 
Saafa oil field.  He explained that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain 
split production from the Abu Saafa field (under a 1950\'s-era 
treaty).  Output had been 150 thousand bpd, of which Bahrain 
received 75 thousand bpd.  In the mid-1990\'s, however, Saudi 
Arabia donated its share to Bahrain, which then received all 
150 thousand bpd.  And in 1999, Saudi Arabia provided an 
additional 50 thousand bpd drawn against its share of future 
production from the Abu Saafa field, for a total of 200 
thousand bpd. 
 
10.  (C) The two countries, the King continued, decided to 
boost production of the Abu Saafa field from 150 thousand to 
300 thousand bpd.  This additional amount would provide 
important revenue for the GOB budget and pay for the 
government\'s plans for economic development.  The King 
claimed that Bahrain borrowed $700 million for the expansion 
of the field.  Now that the field is producing at the higher 
rate, Saudi Arabia is giving Bahrain only its 50 percent 
share (150 thousand bpd) and has stopped the 50 thousand bpd 
loan.  So Bahrain is receiving less oil than before (150 
versus 200 thousand bpd) and must pay off its investment of 
$700 million.  The King said that Saudi Petroleum Minister 
Nuaimi announced recently that Saudi Arabia has 2 million bpd 
of extra capacity.  He complained that Bahrain wants only 50 
thousand of this 2 million, but cannot get it.  He recalled 
that some years ago the American Ambassador in Riyadh had 
intervened on Bahrain\'s behalf, and wondered if the U.S. 
could get involved now. 
 
--------------------------- 
\"Radio Silence\" From Riyadh 
--------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) The King noted that Saudi Arabia had stopped its 
exports of sand (used in construction) to Bahrain, Kuwait, 
and Qatar because of Bahrain\'s reforms and the FTA.  (Note: 
The Saudi Ambassador in Bahrain told the Ambassador 
previously that the sand exports stopped because of a dispute 
over contracts and concerns about environmental degradation 
at sand \"quarries.\"  End Note.)  When Bahrain asks Saudi 
Arabia about the oil, sand, and gas pipeline from Qatar, it 
gets only \"radio silence.\" 
 
------------------------- 
FTA Ratification on Track 
------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) The King told the Ambassador that the Bahraini 
parliament will soon take up ratification of the FTA and will 
approve it.  The Bahraini people are happy with the FTA. 
 
------------------------------- 
Shia Participation in Elections 
------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) The Ambassador noting that Lebanese Shia cleric 
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah had given an interview to Al Wasat 
newspaper and advised Bahrain\'s Shia to participate in 
elections, asked if the King was optimistic about them 
participating in the next elections.  The King expressed 
confidence that the opposition parties would participate in 
the elections.  The majority had done so in 2002, he said, 
but the government wants all Shia to do so in the future. 
(Note:  Municipal elections will take place in fall 2005 and 
parliamentary elections in fall 2006.  End Note.) 
 
14.  (C) The King said that the best Bahrainis who had been 
in exile in London had returned.  He spoke highly of Al Wasat 
editor-in-chief Mansour Al Jamry, who \"speaks in a modern way 
and says what is right and wrong.\"  Majid Al Alawi, the 
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, was very good but the 
oppositionists are upset with him because he is \"one of the 
family.\"  The King said that he had met Saeed Al Shehabi of 
the Bahrain Freedom Movement in London and invited him to 
return to Bahrain, but he \"is more comfortable in London.\" 
The Shia boycotters are not those who were in the UK, but 
those who follow Iran\'s orders.  He noted that Shia 
opposition society Al Wifaq had organized a conference to be 
held January 4 \"with the support of the government.\"  Al 
Wifaq had invited former Lebanese PM Salim Al Hoss and 
Kuwaiti thinker Al Rumaihi to participate, and these are the 
kinds of people the government wants involved, not \"radicals 
from Qom.\" 
 
15.  (C) The King noted that Iranian President Khatemi\'s wife 
would visit Bahrain soon at the invitation of the King\'s wife 
Shaikha Sabika, and she would see a lifestyle much more 
cosmopolitan than that in Iran.  The King joked that Khatemi 
is a moderate, but a terrorist; Khamenei is a religious 
cleric, but a terrorist; and Rafsanjani is a businessman, but 
a terrorist. 
 
16.  (C) The King noted that he would travel to Kuwait 
January 4 to have lunch with Shaikh Jaber and brief him on 
the GCC Summit.  He commented that Kuwait is under pressure 
from the Salafis in parliament and because of the presence of 
American troops, and needs support from Bahrain and the U.S. 
 
------------------- 
Push on the Roadmap 
------------------- 
 
17.  (C) The King stated that he had just returned from 
vacation in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where he had met 
President Mubarak and UK PM Blair, who was also vacationing 
there, and he had spoken with Jordanian King Abdullah.  They 
had all discussed the opportunity for movement on the 
Palestinian situation.  The King hoped that following the 
Palestinian election, President Bush would make a push on the 
roadmap.  The King recounted that he had told Blair that the 
Palestinians had supported Saddam\'s invasion of Kuwait and, 
\"like President Bush,\" he does not trust the Palestinians. 
However, we must help them during this period.

1.  (C) Summary.  GOB officials were quick to defend their 
right to sign an FTA with the United States after several 
news accounts cited Saudi Arabia\'s Finance Minister as saying 
his country would impose duties on re-exported foreign goods 
if the U.S.-Bahrain agreement was ratified.  Youssef Hamoud 
of Bahrain\'s Ministry of Finance and National Economy said 
Bahrain had always understood that re-exporting U.S. goods to 
other GCC states would result in tariffs, and that Bahrain\'s 
primary goal was to increase foreign direct investment.  He 
stated Saudi Arabia is feeling left out and urged Washington 
to support Saudi as it seeks to become a member of the WTO. 
Business leaders have told us they wish to push ahead with 
ratification as quickly as possible despite the Saudi 
reaction.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) A January 4 Bahraini Gulf Daily News article cited 
Saudi Arabia\'s Finance Minister as saying his country would 
impose duties on foreign goods re-exported through Bahrain if 
\"it put into effect a recently signed free trade agreement 
with the U.S.\"  The UAE Gulf News also covered remarks by the 
Saudi Finance Minister on January 4 by citing the minister as 
saying, \"unilateral preferential trade agreements signed by 
some GCC states with countries outside the council undermine 
the GCC and weaken its negotiating position.\"  This echoes 
comments made by Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal at the 
December 3 - 5 \"Gulf Security Dialogue\" conference in Manama 
(Ref B). 
 
3.  (U) GOB officials and representatives were quick to 
respond to the Saudi accusations.  In a January 5 Gulf Daily 
News article, parliament member Abdulnabi Salman stated, 
\"Article 31 of the GCC law regulating economic co-operation 
fully supports Bahrain\'s right to sign a bilateral agreement. 
 (Bahrain) has every right to ratify the agreement and I urge 
members of the parliament and Shura Council not to be 
influenced by others who try to stop the deal.\"  On January 
5, the Bahrain Tribune cited an unnamed official claiming 
\"five of the six GCC countries have agreed that after the 
refusal by the U.S. of collective negotiations with the GCC 
bloc, the members could go ahead with bilateral negotiations 
in order to ensure the common interests of the region.  The 
accord to consider such conditions in free trade agreements 
between GCC states and the U.S. as exceptional was reached by 
the GCC financial and economic committee at its 66th meeting 
in Manama on December 18.\" 
 
4.  (C) Director of Economic Planning at the Ministry of 
Finance and National Economy Youssef Hamoud told Econoff on 
January 5 that Bahrain understood going into the negotiations 
that re-exporting U.S. goods to other GCC states would result 
in application of a tariff.  He stated Bahrain signed the 
agreement to increase foreign direct investment, not to 
re-export goods tax free.  He said there is misunderstanding 
and misquoting taking place in the newspapers.  When asked to 
comment on the Saudi reaction, Hamoud stated it is 
understandable as they are feeling left out especially since 
Oman and UAE also plan to start FTA negotiations soon with 
the U.S.  Hamoud urged Econoff to inform appropriate USG 
officials that Washington should support Saudi Arabia\'s bid 
to become a member of the WTO. 
 
5. (U) Business leaders appear unfazed by the Saudi reaction. 
 One banker told Econoff that a Saudi lack of economic 
liberalization could benefit Bahrain as foreign companies 
might be more apt to relocate to Manama from the eastern 
province.  Other business representatives are urging 
immediate ratification of the FTA in order to get a head 
start on their neighbors in Oman and the UAE. 
 
6.  (C) Comment.  Bahrainis from both the public and private 
sector reaffirm their commitment to proceeding expeditiously 
with ratification and implementation of the FTA.  In fact, 
the King said so directly to the Ambassador January 3 (Ref 
A).  However, they also want to do what they can to soothe 
their large neighbor to the west.  Many Bahrainis have taken 
up a call for closer U.S. engagement with the Saudis on WTO 
accession, perhaps hoping that progress in Geneva will blunt 
Saudi Arabia\'s more local concerns.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Bahraini press January 10 reported rumors of a 
cabinet shuffle to be announced within days or hours.  While 
the press reports varied somewhat, it appear, if accurate, 
that five ministers would leave, two new ministers would be 
appointed, four ministers moved to new positions, two 
ministries closed, and ten ministries impacted by mergers or 
splits.  Those reportedly departing would be Minister of 
Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) Saif, Minister of 
Cabinet Affairs Mutawwa, Minister of Information Hamar, 
Minister of Oil Shaikh Isa, and Minister of State Shoala. 
(Shaikh Isa told the Ambassador today he is not stepping 
down.)  Joining the cabinet would be Bahrain Monetary Agency 
(BMA) Governor Shaikh Ahmed as MOFNE and University of 
Bahrain professor Fatima Al Belooshi as Minister of Social 
Affairs.  Al Belooshi would be the second woman in the 
cabinet.  The net result of the shuffle, if it plays out as 
described in the press, would be a diminution of PM Shaikh 
Khalifa\'s influence and increase in King Hamad and Crown 
Prince Salman\'s power within the cabinet.  The PM may have 
agreed to the changes on the condition that his son, Minister 
of Transportation Shaikh Ali, be given the additional title 
of deputy Prime Minister.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Many Changes in \"Limited\" Shuffle 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Newspapers January 10 were abuzz with reports of a 
planned cabinet reshuffle to be announced \"within days or 
hours.\"  The Cabinet discussed the issue during its regular 
January 9 session, chaired by Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa 
bin Salman Al Khalifa.  While the press reports were not 
identical, they agreed on many of the major items. 
 
3.  (SBU) While reports characterize the reshuffle as 
limited, the end result would be five (of 24) ministers 
sacked, two new ministers, four ministers moved to new 
positions in the cabinet, two ministries dissolved, and ten 
ministries impacted by either mergers or splits.  In 
addition, the number of deputy prime ministers would increase 
from two to four.  One of the new ministers is said to be 
University of Bahrain professor Fatima Al Belooshi as 
Minister of Social Affairs.  She would join Minister of 
Health Nada Haffadh as the only women ministers.  The other 
new minister is Shaikh Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa as 
Minister of Finance and National Economy.  He is currently 
the Governor of the BMA, Bahrain\'s central bank. 
 
---------------------- 
Five Ministers Are Out 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The sackings have attracted the most attention. 
According to press reports, those leaving the cabinet are: 
 
-- Minister of Finance and National Economy Abdulla Saif (who 
negotiated and signed the bilateral free trade agreement); 
-- Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed Mutawwa; 
-- Minister of Information Nabeel Hamar; 
-- Minister of Oil Shaikh Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa; and 
-- Minister of State Abdul Nabi Al Shoala. 
 
Saif will be named Secretary General of the Economic 
Development Board (with minister rank), Mutawwa is rumored to 
be appointed Bahrain\'s Ambassador to France, Hamar could be 
an advisor to King Hamad or head of a government 
organization, and Shaikh Isa and Shoala are supposed to 
depart government service altogether. 
 
5.  (C) However, in a January 10 phone call, Minister of Oil 
Shaikh Isa told the Ambassador that contrary to the press 
reports, he would remain in the cabinet as Minister of Oil. 
\"I tried to retire,\" he said.  He stated that the new cabinet 
would be sworn in on Tuesday, January 11, and he scheduled a 
previously requested meeting with the Ambassador on the same 
day. 
 
--------------------------- 
Four Ministers Moving About 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Four ministers will move to new positions in the 
cabinet.  Minister of Commerce Ali Saleh will become Minister 
of Municipalities and Agriculture, replacing Mohammed Al 
Sitry.  Al Sitry will become minister of a newly merged 
Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs.  Current Minister of 
Justice Jawad Al Arrayed will become a deputy Prime Minister, 
and Minister of Islamic Affairs and Deputy PM Shaikh Abdulla 
bin Khalid Al Khalifa will remain as deputy PM but lose the 
Islamic Affairs portfolio. 
 
7.  (SBU) The Ministries of Information and Cabinet Affairs 
will be dissolved.  There has been discussion for some time 
about breaking the Ministry of Information into its component 
parts and establishing them as government agencies or 
government-owned companies.  The Ministry will operate for 
the time being under the General Organization for Youth and 
Sport (GOYS), though there is no indication GOYS will be a 
permanent home.  There has been no comment on the fate of 
current employees of the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs, but its 
functions could be folded into the Prime Ministry. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Mergers, Acquisitions, and Splits 
--------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) A number of ministries would merge or split.  The 
Ministries of Industry and Commerce will be consolidated 
under current Minister of Industry Hassan Fakhro.  The 
Ministries of Justice and Religious Affairs will be merged 
into one, and so returned to the status quo ante of two years 
ago when there was just one ministry.  The Ministry of 
Electricity and Water will acquire the Ministry of Oil, and 
current Minister of Electricity and Water Shaikh Abdulla bin 
Salman Al Khalifa will be head of the larger ministry.  The 
Public Works portfolio will be split off from the Ministry of 
Housing and Public Works and folded into a new Ministry of 
Public Works and Tenders under current Minister of State for 
Tenders Abdul Hussein Mirza.  The Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs will be split, with current Minister Majid Al 
Alawi staying on as Minister of Labor and Fatima Al Belooshi 
becoming Minister of Social Affairs. 
 
9.  (SBU) The two current deputy prime ministers, Shaikh 
Abdulla bin Khalid and Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Shaikh 
Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, will retain their positions. 
 They will be joined by current Minister of Justice Jawad Al 
Arrayed, who will lose the Justice portfolio, and current 
Minister of Transportation Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, 
who will be both deputy PM and Transport minister.  (Note: 
Shaikh Ali is PM Khalifa\'s son.  End Note.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) Keeping in mind that at this moment all the 
ministerial moves are press speculation, it appears that the 
PM comes out the loser.  Of the five rumored to be leaving 
the cabinet, three are Shaikh Khalifa\'s men:  Mutawwa, Saif, 
and Shoala.  Cabinet newcomer BMA Governor Shaikh Ahmed is 
known to be very close to Crown Prince Salman (and, 
therefore, King Hamad).  Of those who have bolstered their 
portfolios, Fakhro and Mirza also are in the King and Crown 
Prince\'s camp.  Sitry, a Shia, has ties with the Shia bloc 
inside the lower house of parliament, the Council of 
Representatives, a group the King is seeking to encourage for 
having defied Shia calls for boycotting the 2002 
parliamentary elections.  Kicking Minister of Justice Jawad 
Al Arrayed upstairs to be deputy PM would be a loss for us: 
he is a reformer who led the GOB delegation on the 
USG-supported Southern Methodist University \"Rule of Law\" 
program in the U.S. in September 2004.  Knowing he was being 
squeezed, the PM may have agreed to the changes on one 
condition:  that his son, Shaikh Ali, be made deputy PM in 
addition to being Minister of Transportation.  The PM had 
worked for years to appoint Shaikh Ali Minister of Interior, 
but these hopes were dashed when the King engineered the 
appointment of Shaikh Rashed last spring.  If the cabinet 
shuffle plays out as described in the press, PM Khalifa will 
find himself with fewer friends and bases of support at the 
cabinet table.

SUPPORT FOR IRAQ ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 4932 
 
Classified by Ambassador William T. Monroe for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (S) In response to the Ambassador\'s January 11 delivery 
of reftel demarche on Iraqi elections, Foreign Minister 
Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa quickly agreed to make 
public statements in support of the elections.  He said that 
the January 6 Iraq Neighbors conference in Amman did not 
result in a statement as \"clear and forceful\" as he would 
have liked regarding support for the elections.  In Amman, he 
had proposed that the group issue a statement in Baghdad in 
order to speak directly to the Iraqi people.  Jordanian 
Foreign Minister Al Mulki was ready to do it but Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Zebari was \"hesitant\" about the idea. 
Addressing sectarian concerns, Zebari had said that no one 
group in Iraq had the right to rule another.  Shaikh Mohammed 
complained that there were problems in Bahrain\'s 
communication with Iraq\'s Sunnis; Iraq\'s Shia have been more 
active with Bahrain.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Speaking Clearly and Forcefully - In Baghdad? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S) Ambassador January 11 delivered reftel demarche on 
underscoring the importance of Iraqi elections moving forward 
as scheduled to Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak 
Al Khalifa.  The Ambassador emphasized that public 
expressions of support for the elections were most important 
and noted that Egyptian President Mubarak had done so twice 
in recent days.  The Minister replied, \"yes, I will do that.\" 
 He continued that the aims of the January 6 Iraq Neighbors 
conference in Amman were (1) to ensure that neighboring 
countries, particularly Syria and Iran, not interfere in 
Iraq\'s domestic affairs, and (2) to support the elections 
\"clearly and forcefully;\" that is, to urge all Iraqis to 
participate and all of Iraq\'s neighbors to support them.  He 
commented that the conference did not accomplish these aims 
as well as it could have. 
 
3.  (S) Shaikh Mohammed said that the only initiatives on the 
agenda in Amman were from Bahrain - the King\'s previously 
proposed invitation for an Iraqi moderates conference in 
Manama, and Shaikh Mohammed\'s suggestion that meeting chair 
Jordanian Foreign Minister Al Mulki issue a public statement 
of support in Baghdad.  Representatives of the UN and Arab 
League could be present at the announcement.  The other 
ministers agreed it was a good idea but Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Zebari was hesitant, though he did not reject the 
proposal outright.  Shaikh Mohammed reiterated that he is 
ready to go to Baghdad at any time for this purpose.  Such a 
statement would appeal directly to the Iraqi people, saying 
that the elections are a unique opportunity and they should 
take advantage of it. 
 
------------------------------------- 
No One Group Has Right to Rule Others 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S) In response to the Ambassador\'s question, the Foreign 
Minister said that Zebari was very optimistic about the 
elections, expecting up to 8 million voters to participate. 
Regarding Iraq\'s Sunnis, the Foreign Minister said that 
Zebari had told the conference that the \"minority would not 
rule the majority and the majority would not rule the 
minority.\"  He had said the constitutional principle was that 
no one group had the right to rule others.  The Ambassador 
commented that SCIRI leader Al Hakim had said the right 
things during his recent visit to Bahrain.  Shaikh Mohammed 
agreed and noted that many Iraqi Shia had come to Bahrain 
(Hakim\'s son Amer Abdul Aziz Al Hakim is here now), but 
Iraq\'s Sunnis had not done so.  He said there were problems 
in Bahrain\'s communication with the Sunnis.  (Note:  IIG 
President Yawar visited Bahrain for several weeks in 
November.  End Note.)  The Ambassador stated that as many 
Sunnis as possible should participate in the elections so 
they feel they have a stake in Iraq\'s future. 
 
5.  (S) The Minister stated that this election will have a 
major impact on the future of the region.  The participation 
of Turkey and Iran in the neighbors meetings is important. 
He noted that some Arabs feel hesitant about Zebari.  They 
were surprised when he spoke in English at the Sharm meeting 
rather than in Arabic.  Shaikh Mohammed said, \"you cannot 
pull Iraq from the Arab world.\"  The majority of the 
population - Sunni and Shia - are Arabs, not Kurds, Turks, or 
Persians.  Despite the concerns, Zebari, he said, is a \"good, 
reasonable, down-to-earth\" man. 
 
6.  (S) Shaikh Mohammed stated that Iran was strong in Basra 
but other areas of the country are opposed to Iranian 
interference.  There are fears of Iran\'s expansionist 
tendencies in Iraq and throughout the region.  He commented 
that the Iranian government should be more concerned with 
providing good education and clean water to its citizens than 
about spending billions on the military. 
 
7.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

1.  (C) The Ambassador met with  Oil Minister Shaikh Isa Bin 
Ali Al Khalifa on January 11 to discuss developments in the 
petroleum industry.  The Minister opened the meeting by 
commenting on press speculations that he will lose his job in 
an impending cabinet shuffle.  He asserted he would still be 
Bahrain\'s \"oil man\" and dismissed reports that the Ministry 
of Oil would be merged with the Ministry of Electricity and 
Water. 
 
------------------------------ 
Abu Sa\'afa Oil Field Expansion 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Turning to the issue of oil and recent squabbles with 
Saudi Arabia, the Ambassador inquired about the status of 
Saudi Arabia\'s oil grants to Bahrain.  The Minister noted 
that the situation was ironic:  Bahrain had invested $700 
million to double production of the Abu Sa\'afa field only to 
receive a lower quantity of oil.  (NOTE:  Bahrain and Saudi 
Arabia inaugurated the Abu Sa\'afa oil field expansion on 
December 26, 2004.  Overall production increased from 150 
thousand barrels per day (bpd) to 300 thousand bpd.  Prior to 
the expansion, Bahrain received its share of 75 thousand bpd, 
Saudi Arabia\'s share of 75 thousand bpd, and an additional 
grant against Bahrain\'s reserves of 50 thousand bpd for a 
total of 200 thousand bpd.  According to King Hamad (ref A), 
although Bahrain invested $700 million in the expansion, it 
is now receiving only its share of Abu Sa\'afa production -- 
150 thousand bpd.  Saudi Arabia is not granting Bahrain any 
of its share of Abu Sa\'afa and Saudi Arabia suspended the 
grant of 50 thousand bpd in July 2004.  END NOTE).  The 
Minister said higher international oil prices would help 
offset the lower quantity Bahrain receives.  He also told the 
Ambassador that despite the disappointment, Saudi Arabia is 
always very supportive and close to Bahrain. 
 
----------- 
Natural Gas 
----------- 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador asked for an update on the project to 
run a natural gas pipeline from Qatar to Bahrain and on to 
Kuwait.  The Minister said that in principle Qatar is ready 
to go and he recently signed an agreement of intent with the 
GOQ on the project.  However, Qatar appears to be in no rush 
to work out pricing, and Saudi Arabia has still not approved 
the Bahrain-to-Kuwait portion of the pipeline, which would 
traverse Saudi territorial waters.  The Ambassador asked when 
Bahrain will have a gas shortage problem.  The Minister 
responded by saying, \"now.\"  He said the GOB already had to 
cancel the deal between U.S.-firm ALCOA and Bahrain\'s 
aluminum manufacturer (ALBA) to develop a sixth production 
line because of a lack of gas.  The Minister said the Crown 
Prince is heading a committee to discuss the gas shortage. 
The Ambassador asked what was stopping Qatar from proceeding 
with the pipeline to Bahrain.  The Minister responded by 
saying, \"In this part of the world there is a lot of kissing 
and shaking of hands, but at the end no results.\" 
 
4.  (C) The Minister mentioned that Iran had offered Bahrain 
gas from its offshore fields, but minimized the importance of 
its offer, noting that unlike the proposed Qatar deal, Iran 
had not yet developed the field from which the gas would 
come.  The Ambassador reaffirmed that the United States would 
oppose such a deal with Iran. 
 
----------------- 
Upcoming Projects 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) Three projects with possible U.S. content were 
discussed. First on the list was a $160 million 
desulferization project.  The Minister told the Ambassador 
that at an Oil Council meeting on January 10, the GOB invited 
five American companies, BP, and a Korean firm to compete for 
the project.  He did not say who the American companies are. 
The Minister said the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) will 
soon start a $440 million project to upgrade its refinery. 
In regard to the $1.4 billion naptha cracker project (ref B), 
the Minister said BAPCO is reviewing the proposals.  He 
stated that to be a viable joint-venture project, BAPCO must 
retain at least a 30 percent share, but some companies wanted 
a greater portion of the profits.  He did not comment on the 
status of any American company bids.
