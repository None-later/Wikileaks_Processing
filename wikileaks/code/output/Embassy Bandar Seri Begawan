1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BEGINNING A FEW YEARS BEFORE INDEPENDENCE, 
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH HAD OCCURRED IN THE SHARE OF BRUNEI\'S 
PRIVATE ECONOMY OWNED BY ETHNIC MALAY CITIZENS, \"BUMIPUTRA\" 
BUSINESS, AS IT IS CALLED.  WHILE THIS HAS ENRICHED A NUMBER 
OF BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WEALTH HAS 
BEEN SHARED HAS NOT SATISFIED EVERYONE.  CONTACTS WITH THE 
LOCAL MALAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE ELICITED SEVERAL 
EXPRESSIONS OF DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS GROWTH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY TWO COMPANIES, 
QAF AND JASRA, PARTICULARLY THE FORMER.  THESE TWO COMPANIES 
ARE OWNED BY THE SULTAN\'S BROTHERS, AND THEIR RAPID GROWTH 
TO BECOME THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN PGUNAI ASIDE FROM 
BRUNEI SHELL IN JUST A FEW YEARS HAS CAUSEX RESENTMENT. 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.  THE MALAY CHAMBER HAS AMONG ITS LEADERSHIP -- INCLUDING 
ITS PRESIDENT -- MEN WHO WERE PROMINENT IN THE OPPOSITION 
PARTY THAT DIED WITH ELECTORAL POLITICS IN THE MID-SIXTIES 
AND, ACCORDING TO ONE CHAMBER OFFICIAL WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER 
OF THAT PARTY, THE ORGANIZATION CARRIES A BURDEN IN STILL 
BEING IDENTIFIED WITH IT.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER, 
HOWEVER, IS A FORMER MENTERI BESAR -- A CHIEF MINISTER -- 
AND IS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF QAF. THE CHAMBER, DESPITE ITS \"BURDEN\", 
MANAGES TO SERVE AS A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION TO THE GOVERNMENT 
IN ELICITING POLICIES FAVORABLE TO ITS MEMBERS.  AN EXAMPLE 
IS THE CURRENT RUMOR THAT BRUNEI WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL 
BANK:  CHAMBER OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THIS IS THEIR SUGGESTION 
SINCE THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING FROM 
EXISTING BANKS TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS GROWTH.  INTERESTINGLY, 
THEY DO NOT BLAME THE BANKS, OF WHICH ONLY TWO ARE HEADQUARTERED 
HERE AND EVEN THOSE TWO ARE MAJORITY-OWNED BY FOREIGNERS, 
FOR THIS LACK OF SUPPORT.  THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY SAY, THAT 
THE BANKS MUST HAVE COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN, BUT MOST BUMIPUTRA 
BUSINESSMEN HAVE LAND AS THEIR CHIEF ASSET AND THEY CANNOT 
PLEDGE THEIR LAND AS COLLATERAL BECAUSE THE BANKS COULD NOT 
SIMPLY FORECLOSE AND GAIN POSSESSION OF THE LAND IN THE EVENT 
OF DEFAULT.  ALL LAND TRANSFERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL 
OF THE SULTAN AND LAND CANNOT BE OWNED BY NON-CITIZENS. 
(THEORY AND PRACTICE DIVERGES SOMEWHAT ON THE QUESTION OF LAND 
OWNERSHIP IN BRUNEI.  IN THEORY, CITIZENS DO NOT OWN LAND 
EITHER, IN THE SENSE OF HAVING CLEAR TITLE, BUT MERELY 
HOLD LAND AT THE SUFFERANCE OF THE SULTAN;  IN THEORY THE SULTAN 
COULD REPOSSESS LAND, E.G., AGRICULTURAL LAND ALWOWED TO LIE 
IDLE FOR TWO YEARS, BUT IN PRACTICE HE DOES NOT.)  THE LAW 
THAT PROVIDES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS IS BLAMED BY THE CHAMBER 
OFFICIALS FOR THEIR FINANCING DIFFICULTIES, AND THE REQUIREMENT 
THAT THE SULTAN APPROVE LAND TRANSFERS IS REGARDED AS AN 
UNWARRANTED LIMITATION OF THEIR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. 
CHAMBER MEMBERS HAVE SAID THAT INADEQUATE FULFILLMENT OF 
PROMISES TO FAVOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES IN AWARDING GOVERNMENT 
CONTRACTS IS A FAVORITE THEME OF THE GOB - CHAMBER MEETINGS. 
 
4.  THE TWO BIG BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES, HOWEVER, HAVE SUFFERED 
FROM NO SUCH PROBLEMS.  QAF IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE MOHAMED, 
ONE OF THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS OF THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI (AND 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS)  AND ITS RAPID EXPANSION TO A 
COMPANY WITH 1,500 EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IN BOTH 
BRUNEI AND SINGAPORE IN THE SHORT TIME SINCE 1982 IS ACCOUNTED 
FOR MAINLY BY ITS ABILITY TO DRAW ON HUGE FINANCIAL RESERVES 
TO BUY EXISTING BUSINESSES AND THEN ASSURE THEIR SUCCESS 
THROUGH A NETWORK OF GOOD CONNECTIONS.  QAF\'S SINGAPORE 
ASSETS INCLUDE BEN AND CO., THROUGH WHICH QAF STOCK WILL BE 
TRADED ON THE SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE, AND NATIONAL COLD 
STORAGE, A WELL-KNOWN FOOD WHOLESALER AND RETAILER THERE, IN 
ADDITION TO STAKES IN SEVERAL TRADING AND REAL ESTATE 
COMPANIES.  QAF RECENTLY MADE NEWS IN THE BUSINESS PAPERS IN 
SINGAPORE WHEN IT SOLD ITS PIZZA HUT FRANCHISE.  IN BRUNEI, 
QAF\'S INFLUENCE IS BROAD, RANGING FROM CONTROLLING INTEREST 
IN THE ONE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED HERE THROUGH FOOD RETAILING TO 
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A PARTIAL LIST OF QAF\'S LOCAL 
HOLDINGS INCLUDE OWNERSHIP OF QAF PLAZA, BRUNEI\'S NEWEST (AND 
LEAST CONVENIENTLY LOCATED) SHOPPING AND OFFICE COMPLEX: 
20 PERCENT OF THE ISLAND DEVELOPMENT BANK, ONE OF TWO 
LOCALLY-CHARTERED BANKS AND A RECENT ACQUISITION (THE ROYAL 
FAMILY REPORTEDLY OWNS 30 PERCENT OF THE OTHER LOCAL BANK -- 
NATIONAL BANK OF BRUNEI -- AND PRINCE SUFRI IS PRESIDENT OF THE 
BANK);  75 PERCENT OF BRUNEI PRESS, WHICH PUBLISHES THE BORNEO 
BULLETIN;  50 PERCENT OF LOCAL DAIRY FARM OPERATIONS, WHICH OWNS THE 
BEST LOCAL SUPERMARKETS AND WESTERN RESTAURANT, IN ADDITION TO 
CATERING SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ROYAL BRUNEI AIRLINES) AND 
WHOLESALE FOOD DISTRIBUTION;  49 PERCENT OF Q-CARRIER, WHICH 
MARKETS AND SERVICES AIR CONDITIONERS;  50 PERCENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL 
GAS COMPANY, SUPPLIER TO BRUNEI SHELL, AND 100 PERCENT OF FOUR 
OR FIVE OTHER COMPANIES THAT SUPPLY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO 
BRUNEI SHELL;  PLUS VARYING PERCENTAGES OF COMPANIES THAT ARE 
AGENTS FOR SUCH FOREIGN COMPANIES AS MERCEDES-BENZ, NISSAN, 
SUZUKI, BEECHAMS, CADBURY SCHWEPPES, PROCTOR & GAMBLE, AND 
INTERNATIONAL PAINTS.  IN ADDITION, RUMORS HAVE CONNECTED 
QAF WITH THE PLANNED CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL- 
STANDARD HOTEL, TO BE CALLED THE PRINCE HOTEL. 
 
5.  JASRA HAS ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 
AS QAF, BUT IN AN ECONOMY THE SIZE OF BRUNEI\'S, THE GROWTH TO 
THAT LEVEL OVER ONLY SIX YEARS PUTS JASRA INTO THE SAME VERY 
VISIBLE CATEGORY.  JASRA IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE JEFRI, ALSO 
DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNMENT 
TENDER COMMITTEE, AND HAS GROWN THROUGH EXPANSION OF ITS SUPPLY 
AND SERVICE CONTRACTS TO BRUNEI SHELL.  NOW THAT ITS 
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED, THE MAIN BUSINESS 
OF THE COMPANY IS OIL.  JASRA IS A PARTNER IN THE ONLY ACTIVE 
OIL EXPLORATION EFFORT IN BRUNEI IN RECENT YEARS OUTSIDE BRUNEI 
ASMELL, UNDERTAKEN BY JASRA JACKSON, A JOINT VENTURE OF JASRA 
AND THE AMERICAN JACKSON OIL CO.  IF JASRA JACKSON WERE TO 
STRIKE OIL IN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES, IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING 
COMPLICATION IN THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS, AS PRINCE 
JEFRI IS ALSO REPORTEDLY PART-OWNER WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY OF A COMPANY THAT EITHER BUYS OIL FROM BRUNEI 
SHELL OR RECEIVES A QUANTITY AS A PAYMENT IN KIND AND THEN 
RESELLS IT THROUGH SHELL OIL\'S MARKETING ORGANIZATION.  THIS 
PAPER TRANSACTION, OF UNKNOWN VALUE, IS WHERE THE ROYAL FAMILY 
RECEIVES MUCH OF ITS PRIVATE FLOW OF WEALTH FROM BRUNEI\'S OIL. 
JASRA ALSO OWNS THE LARGEST CAR RENTAL AGENCY IN BRUNEI AND, 
AS WITH NEARLY ALL BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS, IS ACTIVE IN REAL 
ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A RECENT MAJOR MOVE WAS THE ACQUISITION 
OF 50 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL OFFICE OF THE VENERABLE HARRISONS 
AND CROSFIELD TRADING COMPANY, A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF IMPORTED 
GOODS TO THE PRIVATE ECONOMY, HENCEFORTH TO BE KNOWN IN BRUNEI 
AS JASRA HARRISONS.  JASRA ITSELF HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTER 
AND SUPPLIER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND BRUNEI SHELL. 
 
6.  THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COMPANIES OWNED BY THE ROYAL 
BROTHERS LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS SOME PLANNED 
OBJECTIVE FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY IN BECOMING SO ACTIVE SO FAST 
IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY COORDINATION 
OF THE FAMILY\'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  SPECULATION ON MOTIVE 
WAS MERELY FUELED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER 1984 TO 
THE EFFECT THAT THE SULTAN OFFICIALLY DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF BRUNEI HAD ANY INTENTION TO BUY ANY COMMERCIAL COMPANY 
\"FOR EXAMPLE, QAF LIMITED\".   THE ANNOUNCEMENT, IN BRUNEI\'S 
OFFICIAL NEWSPAPER, PELITA BRUNEI, WENT ON TO SAY THAT \"THIS 
STRONG DENIAL WAS MADE TODAY IN A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE WHICH WENT ON TO SAY THAT ANY INVOLVEMENT 
BY MEMBERS OF THE BRUNEI ROYAL FAMILY IN ANY COMMERCIAL 
COMPANY WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY IS THEIR OWN 
PERSONAL MATTER AND HAS NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER WITH HIS 
MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT.\"  THE ANNOUNCEMENT ALSO CAUSED SOME 
SPECULATION THAT IT MIGHT BE EVIDENCE OF A FAILURE TO COORDINATE 
THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THAT, IN FACT, THE 
SULTAN MIGHT BE ANNOUNCING HIS DISAPPROVAL OF QAF\'S -- AND 
BROTHER MOHAMED\'S -- ACTIVITIES. 
 
7.  THREE POSSIBLE MOTIVES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED BY 
EXPATRIATE OBSERVERS WHO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ACCOMPANYING 
GROWTH IN DISSATISFACTION FROM OTHER BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN 
AS WELL AS FROM THE CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  (IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD THAT PARTICULARLY CHINESE BUSINESS IN THE SERIA/ 
KUALA BELAIT AREA HAS BEEN AFFECTED, WHERE THE CHINESE WHO LONG 
SERVED AS LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO BRUNEI SHELL HAVE BEEN 
SQUEEZED.)  THERE ARE:  (1)  THAT THE BUSINESS INTERESTS ARE 
INTENDED TO ACHIEVE THE SAME THING AS ANY OTHER BUSINESS, MAKE 
A PROFIT AND ENRICH, IN THIS CASE, FURTHER ENRICH THE OWNERS; (2) 
THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY OBSERVED THAT EXISTING BUMIPUTRA 
BUSINESS WAS NOT ADEQUATELY SKILLED OR SUFFICIENTLY FINANCED 
TO EXPAND INTO AREAS THAT NATIONAL POLICY WANTED TO SEE TAKEN 
OVER FROM FOREIGNERS (OR THAT THEY WERE DISMAYED BY THE 
TENDENCY FOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES TO BE \"ALI BABA\" COMPANIES, 
ONES WHICH HAVE BUMIPUTRA EQUITY PARTICIPATION, AND A MALAY 
NAME, BUT WHICH ARE ACTUALLY ONLY CONTINUATIONS OF WELL- 
ESTABLISHED CHINESE FIRMS WHERE THE MANAGEMENT, LABOR AND 
MOST OF THE EQUITY REMAINS CHINESE), SO THEY DECIDED TO DO IT 
THEMSELVES, OR (3) THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY, ALREADY ASSURED OF A 
MONOPOLY ON POLITICAL POWER, WANTED TO ASSURE THAT LEAVING THE 
HIGH POINTS OF THE ECONOMY IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS, EVEN IF THEY 
WERE BUMIPUTRAS, DID NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE 
POWER CENTERS IN THE SOCIETY. 
 
8.  THE THIRD POSSIBILITY PROBABLY CAN BE DISMISSED FAIRLY 
QUICKLY BECAUSE NOT VERY MUCH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GOES ON IN 
BRUNEI THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR BRUNEI 
SHELL, BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE ROYAL POLITICAL 
MONOPOLY.  MOST BUSINESSES HERE OF ANY SIZE COULD BE QUICKLY 
RUINED IF CUT OFF FROM CONTRACTS FROM THOSE TWO SOURCES.  AN 
ANNOUNCED SCHEME TO SELL QAF STOCK TO BRUNEI CITIZENS, WITH 
LIMITATIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO RESELL IT, MAY BE INTENDED TO 
ALLOW PARTICIPATION IN PRIVATE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY A WIDER GROUP 
WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOSING CONTROL OF A KEY ECONOMIC SECTOR TO 
ANYONE.  THE PLAN WOULD HAVE 30 PERCENT OF THE QAF STOCK 
SOLD AT A SPECIAL PRICE TO QUALIFIED BUYERS. 
 
9.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS PUT THE DOMESTIC ROYAL BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES DOWN TO A SIMPLE DESIRE TO GET RICHER, WHICH MAY 
SEEM UNNECESSARY, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, BUT NOT UNUSUAL 
CERTAINLY IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN CONTEXT.  THIS MAY WELL 
HAVE BEEN THE INITIAL MOTIVATION, BUT THE BUSINESS 
PRACTICES OF THE TWO COMPANIES SEEM TO BE ALLOWING FOR THE 
SECOND POSSIBILITY TO BE AT LEAST A CONSIDERATION.  OFFICIALS 
OF BOTH COMPANIES AT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OR FINANCIAL 
CONTROLLER LEVEL HAVE DECLARED TO EMBOFF THAT THEY NO LONGER BID 
FOR THE BASIC CATERING, SUPPLY AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS OF 
BRUNEI SHELL AND THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ONCE DID.  THESE ARE 
CONSCIOUSLY LEFT TO SMALLER BUMIPUTRA COMPANIES.  QAF AND 
JASRA HAVE MOVED \"UPMARKET\", DOING MORE TECHNICAL OR MORE 
CAPITAL INTENSIVE THINGS AS THEY SEE OTHER BUMIPUTRA 
COMPANIES ABLE TO DO THE SIMPLER THINGS.  TO THE EXTENT THIS 
IS NOT A BUSINESS DECISION, BUT INSTEAD A MATTER OF POLICY 
AIMED AT ACHIEVING A GIVEN STRUCTURE IN THE BUMIPUTRA COMMUNITY, 
THEN HIGHER MOTIVES CAN BE ASCRIBED TO THE ROYAL BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST, IT IS A BUSINESS 
JECISION, AS A JASRA MANAGER ADMITTED TO EMBOFF.  THE LOWER 
END OF THE RANGE OF CONTRACTS HAS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, WITH 
PROFIT MARGINS THINNER AND PRICING TOUGHER, SO THE MANAGERS OF 
THE ROYAL COMPANIES MAY SIMPLY BE MOVING ON TO WHERE THE 
CREAM IS THICKER. 
 
10.  AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHAT THE FOURTH BROTHER, PRINCE 
SUFRI, WILL BE ALLOWED AS HIS SHARE.  HE APPEARS TO BE 
BELATEDLY MAKING HIS MOVE INTO THE BRUNEI BUSINESS WORLD, 
(ASIDE FROM REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, IN WHICH HE HAS HAD 
INTERESTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS) 
WITH THE VEHICLE BEING SINARAN, A COMPANY THAT HAS EXISTED 
SINCE 1974, BUT INACTIVE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY.  SINARAN, REGISTERED 
AS A TRADING AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, MAY BE THE RECIPIENT, IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH AN AMERICAN FIRM, OF SOME OF THE LARGE 
CONTRACTS THAT ARE RUMORED AS AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, 
INCLUDING A NEW AIR BASE, SEVERAL MORE PIECES OF BRUNEI\'S 
COASTAL HIGHWAY, A MAJOR BRIDGE ACROSS THE BRUNEI RIVER AND 
PERHAPS A RE-TENDERING OF THE CONTRACT TO BUILD A COGENERATION 
PLANT.  CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN FIRM HAS INDICATED IT BELIEVES 
IT HAS A GOOD CHANCE AT THESE, BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTION WITH 
SINARAN.  IF ALL THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS SET OUT TO BUILD 
LARGE BUSINESSES WITHIN BRUNEI, THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER 
BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN WILL BE ACCORDINGLY LIMITED.  THIS IS 
EVEN MORE TRUE WHEN THE ACTIVITIES OF SISTERS AND OTHER 
ASSORTED IN-LAWS ARE ADDED.  SEVERAL SECOND-RANKING TRADING 
AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS COUNT ROYALTY AMONG THEIR OWNERS. 
 
11.  THE CONCLUSION IS THAT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE ROYAL 
FAMILY DOMINATES THE MALAY BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO AN EXTENT THAT 
PROBABLY IS CAUSING GREATER DISSATISFACTION THAN THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH THEY DOMINATE THE NATION\'S POLITICS.  MOTIVES MAY BE 
TRADITIONAL BUSINESS REASONS, AND THE ECONOMIC DOMINANCE 
INADVERTENT, MERELY THE NATURAL RESULT OF BETTER FINANCING AND 
GOOD CONNECTIONS, BUT THE RESENTMENT BEARS WATCHING.  OFFICIALS 
OF THE TWO BIG COMPANIES THEMSELVES ARE AWARE OF IT, BUT THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH THE ROYAL FAMILY BELIEVES IT SOMETHING TO 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS UNKNOWN.  PRINCE SUFRI\'S BUSINESS 
PROSPECTS MAY BE BOTH DEPENDENT ON AND AN INDICATION OF THE 
EXISTENCE OF SUCH CONCERN.

SUBJECT: SULTAN OF BRUNEI STRIKES TWO MORE RAPID BLOWS AT 
ISLAMIZATION 
 
REF: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 1379 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2. AS REPORTED REFTEL THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI BOYCOTTED 
ACTIVITIES MARKING THE PROPHET\'S BIRTHDAY ON NOV 25 IN 
ANGER AT THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE HAVING INTRODUCED 
SEPARATION OF THE SEXES AT THE CELEBRATION. EVEN THOUGH THE 
DECISION TO SEPARATE THE SEXES WAS REVERSED, NO MEMBER OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY PARTICIPATED. WHILE THE SHOCK WAVES FROM THIS 
CONTRETEMPS WERE STILL REVERBERATING AROUND BRUNEI THE SULTAN 
TOOK TWO MORE STEPS TO UNDO INNOVATIONS INTRODUCED BY 
ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES. 
 
3. ON NOV 27, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING, NEWSCASTERS ON 
RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI (RTB) APPEARED WITHOUT HEAD 
COVERING. THE PRACTICE OF HAVING NEWSCASTERS WEAR HEAD 
COVERING, THE WOMEN TIGHT-FITTING SCARVES THAT FASTEN 
UNDER THE CHIN AND MEN THE TRADITIONAL MALAY SONGKOK, WAS 
GRADUALLY INTRODUCED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS; AND IT HAD 
BEEN ABOUT A YEAR SINCE ANY FEMALE APPEARED ON THE 
TELEVISION NEWS WITH UNCOVERED HEAD. SINCE NOV 27 HEAD 
COVERINGS HAVE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED, AND IT IS NOW WIDELY 
KNOWN THAT A WRITTEN ORDER BANNING HEAD COVERING WAS ISSUED 
BY PRINCE JEFRI, WHO AS MINISTER OF CULTURE, YOUTH AND SPORTS 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TELEVISION, AND THAT THE ORDER HAD BEEN 
CLEARED WITH THE SULTAN. (THE ORDER ALMOST CERTAINLY 
ORIGINATED WITH THE SULTAN). 
 
4. NEXT, ON NOV 30, IT WAS ANNOUNCED ONT HE EVENING TELEVISION 
NEWS THAT, BY COMMAND OF THE SULTAN AND EFFECTIVE THE FOLLOWING 
DAY, THE BRUNEI GOVERNMENT OFFICE OF INFORMATION WAS ABOLISHED 
AS A SEPARATE ENTITY AND ITS FUNCTIONS TRANSFERRED TO A 
JOINT BROADCASTING/INFORMATION DEPARTMENT TO BE HEADED BY RTB 
DIRECTOR PENGIRAN BADARRUDIN AND THAT THE LIKE-NAMED PEHIN 
BADARRUDIN, HEAD OF THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT, WAS TRANS- 
FERRED BACK TO THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT. THUS 
BROADCASTING AND INFORMATION WERE RESTORED TO THE SITUATION 
THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF A SEPARATE INFORMATION 
DEPARTMENT, WHICH UNDER PEHIN BADARRUDIN WAS WELL KNOWN FOR 
ITS VIGOROUS DISSEMINATION OF RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE 
VIEWPOINTS, WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDITED GOVERNMENT INFORMATION 
BULLETIN HAVING BECOME A MOUTHPIECE FOR THE MUFTI OF BRUNEI. 
THE INFORMATION FUNCTION NOW COMES UNDER THE CONTROL OF 
A MAN WHO IS ANATHEMA TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES. 
 
5. COMMENT: IF THERE WAS DOUBT IN ANYONE\'S MIND THAT 
THE SULTAN\'S INTENT WAS TO STRIKE A BLOW AT CREEPING 
ISLAMIZATION, THAT DOUBT HAS NOW BEEN DISPELLED. BY 
MOVING QUICKLY TO UNDO TWO OF THE MOST VISIBLE SIGNS OF 
ISLAMIZATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE HUMILIATION OF THE 
ORGANIZERS OF THE PROPHET\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS, INCLUDING 
MOST NOTABLY MINISTER OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION ABDUL AZIZ, 
THE SULTAN CAUGHT THE PROPONENTS OF ISLAMIZATION AT A 
WEEK MOMENT. THE EMBASSY REGARDS THIS AS A WELL EXECUTED 
MANEUVER ON THE SULTAN\'S PART, IF SUCCESSFUL,  A HEALTHY 
DEVELOPMENT FOR BRUNEI. THERE MAY STILL, OF COURSE, BE 
SOME REACTION, WHICH COUL CENTER AROUND THE SULTAN\'S 
FATHER WHEN HE RETURNS FROM MEDICAL TREATMENT IN ENGLAND; 
BUT THE STATE OF THE SERI BEGAWAN\'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL 
HEALTH MAKE IT QUESTIONABLE THAT HE COULD LEAD A SUSTAINED 
CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF GREATER ISLAMIZATION. 
 
6. THE ADVOCATES OF ISLAMIC FUNDEMENTALISM IN BRUNEI, 
INSPIRED BY EXAMPLES FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE ISLAMIC 
WORLD, APPARENTLY FORGOT IN THEIR ZEAL TO SERVE GOD THAT 
THEY HAD NEGLECTED TO CONSULT CAESAR.

SUBJ: THE SULTAN\'S FIRST YEAR ON HIS OWN - A SOLID PERFORMANCE 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2. SUMMART: THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI HAS NOW GOVERNED BRUNEI ON 
HIS OWN FOR A LITTLEMSORE THAN ONE YEAR.  IMPORTANT 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDE VISITS TO ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE 
NATION AND AN EMPHASIS ON A RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT.  HE HAS 
WARNED AGAINST THE SPREAD OF EXTREMIST ISLAMIC BELIEFS AND 
MOVED TO REINFORCE A MODERATE ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE IN BRUNEI. 
IN THE FOREIGN POLICY AREA, BRUNEI SEEKS A ROLE THT IS BEYOND 
MERE RECOGNITION OF ITS RIGHT AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION.  THE 
MILITARY\'S CONTACTS WITH OTHER NATIONS ARE EXPANDING AND IT IS 
MOVING TOWARDS UPGRADING ITS EQUIPMENT CAPABILITIES.  THE 
SULTAN\'S ADMINISTRATION HAS SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO TACKLE 
DIFFICULT SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PROBLEMS IN THIS MALAY SOCIETY 
THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DRUG REHABILITATION CNETER AND 
AN INFORMATION PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF 
AIDS.  BRUNEI\'S PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE OF 
ITS NEIGHBORS, ARE MODEST.  THE NATION NEEDS TO IMPROVE BASIC 
SERVICES, SUCH AS TELEPHONE AND WATER SERVICE.  MORE 
TROUBLESOME IS THE CONTINUAL BLURRING OF LINES BETWEEN PUBLIC 
AND PRIVATE BUSINESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. WITH THE DEATH OF THE SERI BEGAWAN (SUTLAN\'S FATHER) IN 
SEPTEMBER 1986, THE SULTAN COULD FINALLY SET HIS OWN 
COURSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, CHOOSE HIS OWN CABINET, AND 
GOVERN THE NATION OF BRUNEI, WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF HIS FATHER. 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FORTY DAY MOURNING PERIOD HE 
INSTALLED A NEW CABINET THAT GAVE SOME VERY ABLE MEN, 
SUCH AS PEHIN ISA, IMPORTANT POSTS.  AT THE SAME TIME 
THE SULTAN SHUNTED ASIDE SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, SUCH AS PEHIN AZIZ, 
WHOSE IDEAS FOR BRUNEI DID NOT MATCH HIS OWN.  ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS 
THE SULTAN AND PEHIN ISA TACKKED WAS THE CRITICISM THAT THE 
SULTAN WAS TOO DISTANT FROM THE PEOPLE.  FOR THE LAST YEAR 
THE SULTAN HAS JORNEYED AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH TO A 
KAMPONG, MET THE KAMPONG LEADERS, VISITED THE KAMPONG 
SCHOOL AND MOSQUE, AND THEN SEEN A PRIVATE 
SECTOR ENTERPRISE RUN BY A BUDDING BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMAN.  ALL 
OF THIS HAS BEEN RECORDED BY RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI AND SHOWN 
ON THE VENING NEWS.  ANOTHER REGULAR FEATURE OF THESE VISITS 
HAVE BEEN THE SULTAN ACCEPTING PETITIONS FROM THE KAMPONG ELDERS 
FOR SERVICES AND NEEDS OF THE KAMPONG.  DURING THIS YEAR THE 
SULTAN HAS VISITED ALL OF BRUNEI, INCLUDING KAMPONGS ONLY 
ACCESSIBLE BY AIR OR RIVER BOAT.  A CONSITENT THEME EMPHASIZED 
BY THE SULTAN AND ISA DURING THE YEAR IS THE GOVERNMENT IS TO 
BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. 
 
4. THROUGH THESE KAMPONG VISITS PEHIN ISA, WHO HEADS THE 
ESTABLISHMENTS OFFICE, AND HIS STAFF HAVE BEGUN TO TACKLE THE 
KAMPONG PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL ALLIENS 
AND THE LACK OF SERVICES.  IN A SIMILIAR MOVE, THE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION HAS UNDERTAKEN A PROGRAM TO VISIT EVERY SHCOOL IN THE 
NATION (THERE ARE 176 SCHOOLS) AND MEET THE SCHOOL PRINICPALS AND 
TEACHERS.  ONE OF THE VIIBLE CHANGES IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE NOW REPARIED 
WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WERE IN DEPLORABLE SHAPE, ESPECIALLY FOR A 
NATION OF BRUNEI\'S WEALTH. 
 
5. ANOTHER CIRICISM OF THE BRUFEI GOVERNMENT IS THT IT 
DOESN\'T FACE TOUGH ISSUES WITH CULTURAL AND SOCIAL 
IMPLICATIONS.  ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE OFFICIAL LINE ON 
DRUGS USED TO BE THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  DURING THE 
LAST YEAR THE SULTAN HAS WARNED AGAINST THE EVILS OF DRUG 
ABUSE AND THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED A DRUG REHABILITATION 
CENTER.  WHILE BRUNEI\'S DRUG PROGLEM IS MINOR COMPARED TO 
THAT OF MALAYSIA, THE GOVERNMMENT NOW ACKNOWLEDGES 
THE ISSUE AND IS WORKING TO PREVENT DRUG ABUSE. 
 
6. ANOTHER DIFFICULT ISSUE THAT THE HEALTH MINISTER AND HIS 
DEPARTMENT HAVE FACED FORTHRIGHTLY IS AIDS.  THE NATION HAS 
LAUNCHED A PUBLIC INFORMATION COMPAIGN WITH POSTERS AND 
PAMPHLETS.  WHAT WAS TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGED WITH THE INTRODUCTION 
OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT BRUNEI HAS A COMMUNITY OF HIGH RISK 
MEN, SOMETHING MOST BRUNEIANS PREFER TO OVERLOOK. 
 
7. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
REALIZATION THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE HIGH NUMBER 
OF TRAFFIC DEATHS AND ACCIDENTS THAT TAKE PLACE IN BRUNEI.  THE 
HEALTH MINISTRY AND COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY WORKED TOGETHER TO 
PASS A SELT BELT LAW, A GOOD START.  THEN THE MINISTER OF 
COMMUNICATIONS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN FOR DRIVER\'S EDUCATION. 
 
8. THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT WORKS TO STOP ANY 
KNOWN ISLAMIC EXTREMIST FROM ENTERING THE NATION.  TOP 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE WORRIED BY THE PROBLEMS IN MALAYSIA 
WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND WORK TO PREVENT TE GROWTH IN 
BRUNEI.  THE SULTAN IS ALSO PROMOTING 
MAINSTREAM ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  THIS YEAR THE SULTAN PERFORMED 
THE HAJ ALONG WITH MANY OF ADVISORS.  THE PEOPLE OF BRUNEI, 
INCLUDING BUSLOADS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN, LINED THE STREETS WHEN 
HE DEPARTED AND AGAIN WHEN HE RETURNED.  THE DAY WHEN THE 
SULTAN RETURNED THERE WAS A MASSIVE PUBLIC GATHERING NEAR 
THE PALACE WHERRE THE SULTAN SPENT HOURS WITH HIS 
SUBJECT, TAKING WITH EVERYONE, ALL TO THE CONSTERNATION 
OF HIS SECURITY PEOPLE. 
 
9. THE SULTAN HAS WORKER TO SIDESTEP THOSE WHOSE VIEWS 
ARE NOT IN LINE WITH HIS, FOR INSTANCE, THE GRAND MUFTI 
WHO IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE OLD GUARD.  HIGH GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS ARE PROMOTING THE CAREER OF THE RELATIVELY YOUNG 
PERMANENT SECRETARY OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS, WHOSE SPEECHES 
RELFLECT THE SULTAN\'S MODERATE ISLAMIC VIEWS. 
 
10 IN THE FOREIGH POLICY ARDA, BRUNEI IS MOVING BEYOND ITS 
GOAL SINCE INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WAS RECOGNITION OF THE COUNTRY 
AND ITS RIGHT TO EXIST AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE.  THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY IS PLAYING MORE OF A ROLE IN ASEAN MEETINGS AND 
PREPARING FOR BRUNEI\'S LEADERSHIP OF VARIOUS COMMITTEES.  THE 
ASEAN LABOR CONFERENCE, HELD IN LATE 1986, WAS THE FIRST 
MEETING AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL HELD IN BRUNEI.  ONE OF THE 
DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF THE SERI BEGAWAN\'S PASSING FROM THE 
SCENE HAS BEEN INDONESIA.  SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THE SULTAN 
OFFERED A SOFT LOAN OF $100 MILLION TO INDONESIA, SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED DURING THE SULTAN\'S FATHER 
TIME BECAUSE HE NEVER FORGAVE THE INDONESIANS FOR THEIR 
ROLE IN THE 1962 UPRISING. 
 
11. WHILE BRUNEI FOREIGN POLICY EMPHASIZES CONSENSUS, AS DOES 
ITS WAY OF LIFE, AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS, THE RECENT ASEAN DEBATE 
ON WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO MANILA DEMONSTRATE THE NATION IS 
WILLING TO TAKE A POSITION AND DEFEND IT.  EARLY ON BRUNEI 
DECIDED THE MINISTERIAL MUST GO ON IN MANILA AND HAS NOT 
WAVERED FROM THAT POSITION. 
 
12. THE MILITARY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND THEIR CONTACTS WITH 
OTHER NATIONS THIS PAST YEAR.  THEY HAVE MOVED TO SHARE 
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH THE MALAYSIANS AND THE MALAYSIANS 
WORKED WITH THE BRUNEIANS TO CLEAR SEA AND AIR TRAFFIC DURING 
THE BRUNEIAN\'S FIRING OF TWO EXOCET MISSLES.  THE BRUNEIANS ARE 
CONSIDERING A JOINT VENTURE IN A MUNITIONS PLANT IN MALAYSIA. 
SINGAPORE EXISTING PROGRAMS IN BRUNEI CONTINUE TO GROW.  RBAF 
TROOPS ARE OBTAINING BASIC SPECIAL FORCES TRANING IN 
AUSTRALIA. 
 
13. THE MILITARY IS MOVEING TOWARDS NEW EQUIPMENT ACQUISTIONS 
INCLUDING FIXED WING AIRCRAFT, NEW PATROL BOATS (CORVETTE 
CLASS) AND AN INTEGRATED RADAR SYSTEM.  THE MAJOR CONSTRAINT IS 
THE LACK OF PERSONNEL.  OVER 4,000 MEN ARE ALREADY IN THE 
MILITARY, A LARGE AMOUNT FOR A NATION OF JUST 225,000 WITH ONLY 
ABOUT 135,000 MALAYS. 
 
14. BRUNEI\'S PROBLEMS ARE MODEST, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO 
NEIGHBORING NATIONS.  IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE NEW 
MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT, HIS MINISTRY, WHICH IS REALLY A GIANT 
PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT, JUST ISN\'T ABLE TO MAINTAIN ROADS WELL 
OR BUILD GOOD BRIDGES IN A TIMELY FASHION.  WHY A NATION WITH 
6 FEET OF RAINFALL A YEAR HAS PERIODIC WATER SHORAGES IS A 
QUESTION NO MINISTRY OFFICALS WANTS TO ANSWER.  LOCAL TELEPHONE 
SERVICE CONTINUES TO BE A SORE SPOT WITH EVERYONE. 
 
15. ONE PROBLEM THAT IS GETTING BIGGER IS THE BLURRING OF 
LINES BETWEEN PULBIC AND PRIVATE BUSINESS.  AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE 
IS THE INTERNATION BANK OF BRUNEI, FORMERLY THE ISLAND 
DEVELOPMENT BANK.  THIS BANK IS CONTROLLED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY 
AND THE DIRECTORS ARE MEMBERS OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE.  THE 
QUESTION IS WHO SHOULD REGULATE THE BANK IF THE MINISTRY 
OFFICIALS ARE THE DIRECTORS.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE GROWING 
NUMBER OF FIRMS WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY OR 
RELATIVES OF MINISTERS.  THE QUESTION IS: \"JUST HOW COZY CAN 
THE RELATIONSHIPS BE BEFORE THEY CAUSE DIFFICULTIES. 
 
16. ANOTHER PROBLEM AREA IS ON PUBLICITY ATTACHED TO 
THE SULTAN\'S VENTURES OUTSIDE OF BRUNEI, WHETHER IT BE THE 
RECENT PURCHASE OF THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL OR THE SOFT 
LOAN FOR INDONESIA.  MONEY SPENT INSIDE BRUNEI IS NOT 
VIEWED IN A HARSH LIGHT, FOR INSTANCE, BRUNEIANS DO NOT 
VIEW THE PALACE AS AN EXTRAVAGENCE BECAUSE IT DOUBLES AS A 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING AND THEY GET TO VISIT IT AT LEAST ONCE 
A YEAR, AT HARI RAJA, WHEN THE SULTAN SHAKES EVERYONE\'S 
HAOND AND GIVES FOOD TO ALL VISITORS.  HOWEVER, BRUNEIANS 
QUESTION PURCHASES OR VENTURES OUTSIDE THE NATION WITH THE 
ARGUMENT THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING 
BRUNEI.

SUBJECT: ADMIRAL HARDISTY\'S MEETING WITH SULTAN OF BRUNEI 
 
REF: (A) BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 786  (B) STATE 331452 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  USCINCPAC ADMIRAL HARDISTY MET WITH 
SULTAN OF BRUNEI 21 NOV TO DISCUSS PROSPECTS FOR 
MODEST EXPANSION OF U.S.-BRUNEI MILITARY RELATIONS. 
OTHER TOPICS COVERED WERE PHILIPPINE BASE NEGOTIATIONS, 
U.S.-SINGAPORE AGREEMENT, SULTAN\'S VISIT TO U.S. 
AIRCRAFT CARRIER, AND GULF CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  USCINCPAC ADMIRAL HARDISTY CALLED ON SULTAN OF 
BRUNEI 21 NOV, ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR PHILLIPS, 
USCINCPAC FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR KILLION AND 
NOTETAKER.  BRUNEI CHIEF OF ARMED FORCES STAFF MGEN 
SULAIMAN WAS PRESENT. 
 
4.  AFTER SULTAN\'S WELCOME, ADMIRAL HARDISTY SAID HE 
APPRECIATED OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AGAIN AFTER LAST 
CALL IN AUG 1989.  ADMIRAL REVIEWED HIS RECENT DIS- 
CUSSIONS IN MANILA WITH MILITARY AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS, INCLUDING FOREIGN SECRETARY MANGLAPUS AND 
PRESIDENT AQUINO WHO HAD ASKED HIM TO CONVEY GREETINGS 
TO THE SULTAN.  THE ADMIRAL NOTED THAT PRESIDENT AQUINO 
WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR A NEW BASES 
AGREEMENT SATISFACTORY TO BOTH SIDES. 
 
5.  THE SULTAN SAID HE WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT 
THE GOOD PROSPECQFOR A BASES AGREEMENT.  HE SAID 
HE HAD MET WITH MANGLAPUS AT THE TOKYO ENTHRONEMENT 
CEREMONIES TO DISCUSS REGIONAL ISSUES, AND ALSO 
NOTED TOKYO SIGNING OF A SINGAPORE-U.S. FACILITIES 
AGREEMENT BY VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE FND P.M. LEE 
KUAN YEW.  ADMIRAL HARDISTY REPLIED THAT THE MODERATE 
INCREASE IN U.S. PRESENCE AND ACTIVITIES IN SINGAPORE 
WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR INTEREST AND COMMITMENT TO THE 
REGION, ANT COMPLEMENT, WITHOUT IN ANY WAY REPLACING, 
FACILITIES AVAILABLE INN E PHILIPPINES. 
 
6.  THE SULTAN STATED THAT BRUNEI WOULD BE HAPPY TO 
ALLOW THE U.S. NAVY AND AIR FORCE GREATER ACCESS TO 
BRUNEI FACILITIES.  ADMIRAL HARDISTY DREW ON DEPART- 
MENT\'S TALKING POINTS FOR RESPONSE (REFTELS).  HE 
NOTED THAT A MODEST INCREASE IN OUR EXERCISE AND 
TRAINING ACTIVITIES WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND IN OUR 
MUTUAL BEST INTERESTS.  SULTAN INDICATED HIS 
UNDERSTANDING, BUT DID NOT PURSUE DISCUSSION.  (SEE 
SEPTEL ON ADMIRAL HARDISTY MEETING WITH FOREIGN 
MINISTER FOR DETAILS ON BRUNEI\'S RESPONSE.) 
 
7.  THE SULTAN ASKED ABOUT U.S. PLANS FOR FUTURE FORCE 
LEVEL REDUCTIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES.  ADMIRAL 
HARDISTY OUTLINED CURRENT PROJECTIONS, INCLUDING 
OUR FUTURE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FIGHTER SQUADRONS FROM 
CLARK, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR CLARK AND SUBIC IN TERMS 
OF OUR ON-GOING TALKS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF THE 
PHILIPPINES.  HE REVIEWED NUNN-WARNER REDUCTIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND INDICATED THE REDUCTIONS 
WERE BASED ON THE NEW STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.  HE 
THEN ASSURED THE SULTAN THE U.S. INTENDED TO RETAIN 
A FORWARD PRESENCE FOR OUR BENEFIT AS WELL AS THAT 
OF OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES.  THE SULTAN STRESSED THAT 
U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IS STILL OF VITAL IMPORTANCE 
TO BRUNEI, TO ASEAN, AND TO MOST NATIONS OF THE 
REGION. 
 
8.  SHIFTING TO THE GULF CRISIS, ADMIRAL HARDISTY 
REFERRED TO U.S. DECISION TO CONTINUE OUR BUILD-UP. 
THE U.S. WELCOMED BRUNEI\'S INITIATIVE TOGETHER WITH 
SINGAPORE IN PROVIDING RELIEF SUPPLIES AND OTHER 
ASSISTANCE TO TRAPPED REFUGEES, AS WELL AS BRUNEI\'S 
CONDEMNATION OF IRAQ AND CONTINUED STRONG SUPPORT 
FOR UN SANCTIONS.  THE SULTAN SAID BRUNEI\'S COURSE 
WAS CLEAR IN THIS CRISIS, AND WAS CONCERNED THE 
SITUATION LOOKED INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS. 
 
9.  ADMIRAL HARDISTY NOTED THAT ON HIS LAST VISIT 
THE SULTAN HAD EXPRESSED INTEREST IN AGAIN FLYING OUT 
TO VISIT A U.S. AIRCRAFT CARRIER OFF BRUNEI. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH DESERT SHIELD IT WAS A PROBLEM 
FOR ONE OF OUR CARRIERS TO COME IN CLOSE ENOUGH FOR 
THE SULTAN TO FLY HIS OWN BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, WHICH 
LIMITED THE TRIP TO ABOUT 100 MILES OFF-SHORE.  IF 
FLYING OUT IN ONE OF OUR PLANES WAS NOT DESIRABLE 
(ARRESTED LANDINGS/CATAPULT LAUNCHES DO NOT 
APPEAL TO THE SULTAN), WE WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO 
WORK SOMETHING OUT. 
 
10.  STRESSING OUR CORDIAL BILATERAL RELATIONS, 
THE SULTAN CLOSED THE MEETING BY ASSURING ADMIRAL 
HARDISTY OF A WARM WELCOME ANY TIME HE MIGHT CHOOSE 
TO VISIT BRUNEI IN THE FUTURE.  ADMIRAL HARDISTY IN 
TURN RESPONDED BY COMPLIMENTING THE SULTAN ON THE 
EXCELLENT SHAPE OF BRUNEI\'S ARMED FORCES--A FORCE 
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AND NATION-BUILDING. 
 
11.  ADMIRAL HARDISTY HAS APPROVED THIS MESSAGE.

SUBJECT:  BRUNEI CONSIDERS CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS 
 
REF:  BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 186 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI\'S TWO-YEAR-PLUS CONSTITUTIONAL 
REVIEW PROCESS APPEARS TO BE NEARING COMPLETION. 
MOST OBSERVERS REALISTICALLY EXPECT CHANGES TO BE 
MODEST, AND THE SULTAN\'S FULL POWERS TO REMAIN 
INTACT.  MODERATES ARE PRESSING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, 
INITIALLY APPOINTED BUT WITH A TIME-TABLE FOR MOVING 
TOWARDS DIRECT ELECTIONS.  THE SULTAN WOULD RETAIN 
ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OVER THE ASSEMBLY\'S ACTIONS. 
RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS APPARENTLY HAVE PRESSED FOR THE 
INITIATION OF THE EXTREME ISLAMIC HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, 
BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED IN THIS ATTEMPT. 
 
3.  DEBATE CONTINUES IN THE INNER CIRCLES, BUT 
INFORMED OBSERVERS EXPECT THE SULTAN TO ANNOUNCE HIS 
DECISIONS THIS YEAR.  SHOULD IT MATERIALIZE, THE 
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, EVEN AN APPOINTED ONE, COULD 
PROVIDE A FORUM FOR AIRING ALTERNATE VIEWS, AND 
COULD, IN THE WORDS OF ONE SENIOR MINISTER, SERVE AS 
A \"BRAKE\" ON THE CURRENTLY UNCHALLENGED RELIGIOUS 
RADICALS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
4.  THE SULTAN\'S FEBRUARY 23RD ANNOUNCEMENT (REFTEL) 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REVIEWING THE 
CONSTITUTION HAS PROMPTED SPECULATION ABOUT THE 
NATURE OF THE CHANGES CONTEMPLATED.  WE HAVE BEEN 
TAKING SOUNDINGS WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS COLLEAGUES CONCERNING POSSIBLE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS.  HIGHLIGHTS FOLLOW. 
 
HUDUD PUNISHMENTS 
----------------- 
 
5.  ON FEBRUARY 24TH IVAN LEONG (PROTECT), BRUNEI\'S 
ASSISTANT SOLICITOR GENERAL (THE SECOND-RANKING 
PROSECUTOR IN THE COUNTRY) TOLD THE EMBASSY\'S PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS ASSISTANT QUITE MATTER-OF-FACTLY THAT THE 
PLANNED CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS WILL INCLUDE THE 
ALIGNMENT OF BRUNEIAN CIVIL LAW WITH THE ISLAMIC 
SHARIA LAW.  HE SAID THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE IN THE 
FUTURE A LOT OF BRUNEIANS WOULD BE WALKING AROUND 
WITHOUT HANDS, BECAUSE AMPUTATION IS THE PUNISHMENT 
CALLED FOR BY THE KORAN FOR THEFT. 
 
6.  OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS ASSISTANT PRESSED LEONG AND HE 
INSISTED THAT HE WAS SERIOUS. HE OPINED THAT IT WOULD 
BE A \"GOOD THING\" BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENTS WOULD HELP 
TO ELIMINATE CRIME.  HE ADDED THAT OTHER OFFENSES 
SUCH AS ADULTERY, GAMBLING, DRINKING, AND BEARING 
FALSE WITNESS (INCLUDED IN THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS) 
WOULD BE CONSIDERED \"CRIMES\" AND ATTRACT THE 
APPROPRIATE ISLAMIC PENALATIES. 
 
7.  THE ASSISTANT SOLICITOR GENERAL CLAIMED THAT THE 
COMMITTEE ON SHARIA LAW HAD BEEN WORKING FOR A NUMBER 
OF YEARS ON THE CHANGES, AND THAT ITS WORK HAD NOW 
BEEN FINISHED.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE COMMITTEE\'S 
PROPOSALS WERE NOW BEFORE THE SULTAN FOR HIS 
CONSENT.  CONCERNING OTHER POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REVISIONS, LEONG CLAIMED THAT ALL REFERENCES TO 
DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED ASSEMBLIES WOULD BE REMOVED 
FROM THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE NATIONAL IDEOLOGY, MIB 
(MALAY MUSLIM MONARCHY) WOULD BE OFFICIALLY 
DESIGNATED AS THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN BRUNEI. 
 
8.  ADDING AN ELEMENT OF CREDIBILITY TO LEONG\'S 
ASSERTIONS, THE SULTAN HIMSELF, IN A STATEMENT ISSUED 
FEBRUARY 28, ON THE OCCASION OF THE CELEBRATION OF 
THE FEAST OF THE REVELATION OF THE KORAN, EXTOLLED 
THE VALUE OF THE KORAN AS A GUIDE FOR EVERY ASPECT OF 
DAILY LIFE.  HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT THE KORAN 
SETS FIXED PENALTIES FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES AS ADULTERY, 
GAMBLING, USURY, AND DRINKING ALCOHOL.  HE ASSERTED 
THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD, WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT, 
\"STUDY AND IDENTIFY ALL TEACHINGS OF THE KORAN WHICH 
CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION, 
AND THEY SHOULD BE PRACTICED.\" 
 
9.  ON MARCH 9, THE AMBASSADOR PAID HER INITIAL 
COURTESY CALL ON PEHIN DATO MOHAMED ZAIN, THE 
MINISTER FOR RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER, 
DATO YAHYA, WAS ALSO PRESENT.  THE MINISTER READILY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EVENTUALLY HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE 
FULL APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW IN BRUNEI, INCLUDING 
THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  HE AND HIS DEPUTY SAID THAT 
THESE COULD BE A DETERRENT TO CRIME.  HE SAID THAT 
BEFORE SUCH MEASURES COULD BE INTRODUCED, THE PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE TO BE PROPERLY PREPARED, SO THAT THEY 
WOULD ACCEPT IT, AND THIS WOULD TAKE TIME.  HE SAID 
HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE PLANNED CONSTITUTIONAL 
REVISIONS WOULD INCLUDE SUCH PROVISIONS. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  MINISTER ZAIN, HIS POSITION 
NOTWITHSTANDING, IS NOT A RELIGIOUS EXTREMIST.  HE IS 
BELIEVED TO BE RATHER MODERATE.  IN THIS 
CONVERSATION, MINISTER ZAIN DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AN 
ADVOCATE OF FORCING HUDUD PUNISHMENTS ON A RELUCTANT 
BRUNEI.  THE MINISTER WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE MOST 
ZEALOUS IN SEEKING THE ISLAMIZATION OF BRUNEI IS 
PEHIN DATO AZIZ, THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ALTHOUGH 
WE DO NOT KNOW HIS VIEWS ON HUDUD. 
 
11.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  CONCERNING THE SULTAN\'S 
FEBRUARY 28TH EMBRACE OF THE KORAN, INCLUDING ITS 
SEVERE PUNISHMENTS, WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE 
OCCASION, AND TO THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED WELL INTO 
THE FASTING MONTH OF RAMADAN, WHEN RELIGIOUS ZEAL 
REACHES A PEAK.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SULTAN MET 
NIGHTLY DURING RAMADAN FOR LENGTHY KORAN-READING 
SESSIONS WITH MULLAHS.  THESE MIGHT WELL HAVE 
INFLUENCED HIS PRONOUNCEMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE 
SULTAN ONLY SAID HIS GOVERNMENT \"WILL STUDY AND 
IDENTIFY\" KORANIC TEACHINGS FOR INCORPORATION INTO 
HIS GOVERNMENT\'S ADMINISTRATION.  IN BRUNEI, ISSUES 
CAN BE, AND USUALLY ARE, STUDIED AT GREAT LENGTH, AND 
FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME.  WE SUSPECT THAT THE 
INTRODUCTION OF HUDUD PUNISHMENTS WILL REMAIN UNDER 
STUDY FOR YEARS TO COME.  END COMMENT 
 
A MODEST REFORM:  COUNCIL OF ADVISERS OR LEGISLATIVE 
ASSEMBLY 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
12.  OUR CONCLUSION THAT HUDUD IS NOT IMMINENT FOR 
BRUNEI WAS REINFORCED BY TWO WELL-PLACED OFFICIALS. 
MFA PERMSEC DATO LIM JOCK SENG (PROTECT), WITH WHOM 
THE AMBASSADOR MANAGED A FEW RARE PRIVATE MINUTES 
RECENTLY, DISMISSED THE IDEA OUT OF HAND, SAYING \"MY 
MINISTER WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT\".  (NOTE:  THE MINISTER 
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS PRINCE MOHAMED, THE SULTAN\'S 
BROTHER; HE HAS BEEN CHAIRING THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REVIEW COMMITTEE.  END NOTE)  DATO LIM SAID THAT HE 
EXPECTS THE REFORMS TO INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
AN ADVISORY COUNCIL OF SOME SORT, WHICH HE HOPES 
WOULD MARK MOVEMENT TOWARDS AN EVENTUAL ELECTED 
LEGISLATURE. 
 
13.  BRUNEI\'S MINISTER OF LAW AND ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
PENGIRAN BAHRIN (PROTECT), WAS ALSO REASSURING 
CONCERNLNG HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  ON MARCH 16 THE 
AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM WITH HIM 
AT SOME LENGTH.  STRESSING THAT HE WAS SPEAKING IN 
STRICT CONFIDENCE, THE MINISTER SAID HE HOPED (AND, 
IMPLICITLY, EXPECTED) THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-- GET RID OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH HAS BEEN 
IN EFFECT SINCE 1962; 
 
-- DESIGN A SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THE SULTAN AS PRIME 
MINISTER.  THIS WILL NOT BE A WESTMINSTER-STYLE 
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE STRESSED; 
 
-- ESTABLISH A LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. INITIALLY THIS 
BODY WILL BE APPOINTED, BUT (IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE 
ASST. SOLICITOR GENERAL\'S VIEW) BAHRIN SAID THAT THIS 
WILL ONLY BE TRANSITIONAL TOWARDS AN ELECTED BODY, 
AND THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED 
IN THE CONSTITUTION.  THE BODY SHOULD HAVE 
REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING 
MINORITIES AND THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR. 
INITIALLY, VILLAGE HEADMEN COULD SERVE, PERHAPS, AS A 
TYPE OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO SELECT NOMINEES FOR THE 
BODY.  REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT BE CHOSEN BY DISTRICTS 
(KNOWN HERE AS MUKIM--COLLECTIONS OF VILLAGES). 
AFTER THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, MOVEMENT WOULD BE MADE 
TOWARDS DIRECT ELECTION OF THIS BODY.  THIS BODY 
WOULD DEBATE AND PASS LAWS, INCLUDING THE BUDGET, FOR 
THE SULTAN\'S APPROVAL. 
 
-- RETAIN BRUNEI\'S CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW AS IT IS, 
FOUNDED ON THE BRITISH COMMON LAW SYSTEM.  SHARIA LAW 
WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE FOR RELIGIOUS OFFENSES.  HUDUD 
PUNISHMENTS WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED. 
 
-- TRANSFORM ALL OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF THE 
SULTAN, WHICH HAVE SUBSTITUTED FOR LAWS DURING THE 
PERIOD OF EMERGENCY POWERS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A 
LEGISLATIVE BODY, INTO LAWS. 
 
14.  IN RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT 
THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT 
THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE BODY WOULD SERVE AS A 
\"BRAKE\" ON, AND AS A COUNTER TO, THE RELIGIOUS 
ELEMENTS WHO KEEP PRESSING FOR INCREASED 
ISLAMIZATION.  THIS BROADLY-BASED BODY WOULD PROVIDE 
ALTERNATE VIEWS.  AT PRESENT, BAHRIN CLAIMED, ONLY 
THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS ARE WELL-ORGANIZED AND GET 
THEIR VIEWS HEARD, WITHOUT CHALLENGE, BY THE SULTAN. 
THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WOULD COUNTER-BALANCE WHAT THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL TERMED THE \"RELIGIOUS RADICALS.\" 
 
15.  PENGIRAN BAHRIN SEEMED CONFIDENT OF THE ABOVE 
OUTCOME, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TOTAL CONSENSUS HAD 
NOT YET BEEN REACHED ON THE PROPOSALS.  THE WHOLE 
CABINET HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW 
COMMITTEE, HE SAID, WHICH WAS CHAIRED BY PRINCE 
MOHAMED.  THERE HAS BEEN STRONG RELIGIOUS 
REPRESENTATION.  DISCUSSION HAS BEEN INTENSE, HE 
SAID, WITH SOME ISSUES REVISITED THREE OR FOUR 
TIMES.  BAHRIN SAID THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE 
BE CONSENSUS, SO THAT THE REFORMS WILL BE GENUINELY 
ACCEPTED AND PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. 
 
16.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EMPHASIZED THAT THE 1959 
CONSTITUTION WOULD REMAIN THE BASIS OF BRUNEI\'S LEGAL 
SYSTEM; THERE WOULD BE NO DRASTIC CHANGES.  CHANGES 
RATHER WOULD EVOLVE OVER TIME. 
 
17.  TIMING OF THE REFORMS:  I VENTURED THAT SINCE 
THE SULTAN HAD ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 23RD (NATIONAL 
DAY) THAT THE REVIEW PROCESS IS NEARING COMPLETION, 
PERHAPS HE WOULD ANNOUNCE THE REFORMS ON ANOTHER 
SIGNIFICANT DAY, PERHAPS JUNE 12 WHEN THE 
RAMADAN-POSTPONED NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS WILL TAKE 
PLACE, OR PERHAPS THE SULTAN\'S JULY 15 BIRTHDAY.  THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT SEPTEMBER 23RD, 
CONSTITUTION DAY, WOULD BE ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.  HE 
SAID THAT SINCE THE SULTAN HAS PUBLICIZED THE REVIEW 
PROCESS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ACTUAL REFORMS WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED THIS YEAR. 
 
WILL MALAY MUSLIM MONARCHY (MIB) CONCEPT BE 
INCORPORATED INTO THE CONSTITUTION? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
18.  THIS IS ANOTHER QUESTION ON WHICH OPINIONS 
DIFFER.  SOME OBSERVERS, INCLUDING THE USUALLY 
WELL-INFORMED CHARGE OF OMAN (PROTECT), BELIEVE THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WILL FORMALLY INCORPORATE 
BRUNEI\'S DE FACTO NATIONAL IDEOLOGY, THE MIB, INTO 
THE CONSTITUTION.  OTHERS, INCLUDING THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, SAY THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN, AS THE 
CONSTITUTION ALREADY ESTABLISHES ISLAM AS THE STATE 
RELIGION. 
 
A LONG SHOT:  PRINCE MOHAMED AS PRIME MINISTER? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
19.  DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS 
HAS TRIGGERED SOME RENEWED DISCUSSION OF THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SULTAN WILL NAME HIS RESPECTED 
BROTHER, PRINCE MOHAMED, PRIME MINISTER.  ACCORDING 
TO THE OMANI CHARGE, SEVERAL OF HIS SOURCES BELIEVE 
THIS IS IN THE OFFING.  APPARENTLY THIS WOULD BE 
INTENDED AS A GESTURE TO HEAL WHAT IS ALLEGED TO BE 
THE STILL-REMAINING BREACH BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS 
CAUSED BY THE SULTAN TAKING A SECOND WIFE.  WE FIND 
THIS UNLIKELY BUT REPORT IT AS A LONG SHOT BECAUSE OF 
ITS SOURCE. 
 
SULTAN TO NAME A CROWN PRINCE? 
------------------------------ 
 
20.  SEVERAL SOURCES SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE YEAR 
THE SULTAN WILL NAME PRINCE BILLAH, HIS OLDEST SON 
(BY HIS FIRST WIFE), THE CROWN PRINCE AND 
HEIR-APPARENT.  THIS WOULD END THE OCCASIONAL MILD 
SPECULATION THAT THE SULTAN MIGHT BREAK WITH 
TRADITION AND NAME HIS REPORTEDLY HIGHLY INTELLIGENT 
SON BY HIS SECOND WIFE, PRINCE \'ABDUL \'AZIM, CROWN 
PRINCE INSTEAD OF BILLAH, WHO IS VERY MODESTLY 
ENDOWED IN THE BRAINS DEPARTMENT.  WE BELIEVE 
TRADITION WILL PREVAIL AND BILLAH EVENTUALLY WILL BE 
NAMED, DESPITE THE SULTAN\'S GREAT PRIDE IN PRINCE 
\'ABDUL \'AZIM, WHICH I PERSONALLY OBSERVED. 
 
21.  LOOKING MUCH FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF 
SPECULATION, A SCENARIO WHEREBY PRINCE BILLAH BECAME 
THE SULTAN AND PRINCE MOHAMED BECAME PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD BE CREDIBLE.  BILLAH COULD HANDLE THE 
CEREMONIAL DUTIES OF SULTAN, GUIDED BY HIS FATHER 
BEHIND THE THRONE, WHILE THE COMPETENT AND RESPECTED 
MOHAMED, WHO IS STILL IN HIS FORTIES, RAN THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
22.  COMMENT:  AS THE FOREGOING SUGGESTS, THE 
SITUATION WITH REGARD TO PENDING CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS REMAINS FLUID.  THE CANDID OVERVIEW PROVIDED 
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS THE 
CONSENSUS OF THE MODERATES IN THE CABINET.  THE 
CONFIDENT ASSERTION OF THE ASSISTANT SOLICITOR 
GENERAL THAT HUDUD PUNISHMENTS ARE IMMINENT PROBABLY 
REFLECTS HIS ACCESS TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
MORE RELIGIOUSLY RADICAL ELEMENTS, WHO MOST LIKELY 
HAVE PRESSED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. 
 
23.  GIVEN THE ONGOING SEARCH FOR CONSENSUS, WHAT 
ULTIMATELY EMERGES PROBABLY WILL NOT BE AS LIBERAL AS 
WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL APPEARS TO EXPECT, NOR IS 
THERE LIKELY TO BE MUCH THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE 
POSITION OF RELIGIOUS RADICALS.  CHANGES ARE LIKELY 
TO BE MODEST AND INCREMENTAL, AND THE SULTAN\'S 
ULTIMATE POWERS WILL REMAIN INTACT. 
 
24.  NONETHELESS, AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INDICATED, 
THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME KIND OF CONSULTATIVE OR 
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, WITH HOWEVER MODEST POWERS, 
COULD AT LEAST PROVIDE A FORUM FOR AIRING ALTERNATE 
VIEWS.  IT COULD GIVE THE SULTAN NEEDED FEEDBACK FROM 
HIS PEOPLE CONCERNING GOVERNMENT POLICIES, WHICH HE 
DOES NOT NOW RECEIVE, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, FROM ANYONE 
EXCEPT, WE SUSPECT, HIS BROTHER THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER.  WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT THE DOOR TO 
DEMOCRACY TO OPEN IN BRUNEI ANYTIME SOON, THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS FAVORED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
BAHRIN JUST MLGHT OPEN A WELL-SCREENED WINDOW AN INCH 
OR TWO.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VISIT TO IRAN 
 
1.  (U)  BRUNEI\'S FOREIGN MINISTER, PRINCE 
MOHAMED BOLKIAH, VISITED IRAN APRIL 10-12.  THE 
APRIL 18 EDITION OF THE BORNEO BULLETIN, 
DRAWING FROM A JOINT STATEMENT ISSUED AT THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE VISIT, REPORTED THAT THE TWO 
COUNTRIES HAD \"FORTIFIED THEIR EXCELLENT 
BILATERAL RELATIONS.\" 
 
2.  (U)  THE PRESS REPORT CITED THREE 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE VISIT:  (A) AN AGREEME 
TO EXEMPT HOLDERS OF DIPLOMATIC AND OFFICIAL 
PASSPORTS FROM VISA FOR SHORT OFFICIAL AND/OR 
TRANSIT VISITS; (B) AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO 
EXCHANGE LAND ON A RECIPROCAL BASIS FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OF EMBASSIES IN EACH OTHER\'S 
CAPITAL; AND (C)  AN OFFER BY IRAN OF 
SHORT-TERM DIPLOMATIC TRAINING FOR BRUNEIAN 
DIPLOMATS.  A JOINT COMMISSION WILL BE 
ESTABLISHED AT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' LEVEL TO 
PERIODICALLY REVIEW PROGRESS IN AREAS OF MUTUAL 
INTEREST, WITH THE FIRST MEETING TO BE HELD 
EARLY NEXT YEAR IN BRUNEI. 
 
3.  (C)  PRINCE MOHAMED REVIEWED HIS TRIP WITH 
ME APRIL 18.  HE SAID HE HAD A GOOD VISIT, WITH 
MOSTLY BILATERAL MATTERS DISCUSSED.  HE FOUND 
THE COUNTRY BEAUTIFUL, AND REMARKED ON THE 
ABSENCE OF TOURISTS, WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD BE 
A REVENUE-RAISER.  HE REMARKED THAT THERE IS A 
LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
BETWEEN BRUNEI AND IRAN, BUT DID NOT 
ELABORATE. 
 
4.  (C)  TO MY QUESTION, HE CORRECTED AN 
INITIAL PRESS REPORT WHICH HAD ALLEGED THAT 
BRUNEIAN STUDENTS WOULD BE ATTENDING IRANIAN 
UNIVERSITIES.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT 
IRAN HAD ONLY OFFERED SHORT-TERM COURSES FOR 
BRUNEIAN DIPLOMATS.   HE SAID THAT OTHER 
COUNTRIES HAVE MADE SIMILAR OFFERS, AND BRUNEI 
WELCOMES SUCH TRAINING.  NO DECISION HAS BEEN 
MADE CONCERNING ACCEPTING IRAN\'S OFFER, BUT THE 
MINISTER SAID HE SEES NO PROBLEMS WITH IT. 
 
4.  (C)  PRINCE MOHAMED SAID THAT IRAN\'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAD RAISED THE QUESTION OF 
EXTENSION OF THE NPT DURING THEIR MEETING. 
MINISTER VELYATI HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE IS 
CONFIDENT THAT THE NPT WILL BE EXTENDED.  I 
ASKED WHETHER IRAN HAD INDICATED WHETHER IT 
WOULD SUPPORT INDEFINITE EXTENSION.  THE 
MINISTER REPLIED THAT VELYATI HAD SAID THAT 
IRAN WILL LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THE DEBATE TO SEE 
HOW IT PROCEEDS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  BRUNEI AND IRAN CONTINUE TO 
APPEAR TO THIS EMBASSY AS STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, 
GIVEN IRAN\'S ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST 
REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP 
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.  THE SULTAN AND PRESIDENT 
RAFSANJANI HAVE EXCHANGED STATE VISITS, AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER VALYATI WILL VISIT BRUNEI NEXT 
YEAR TO HEAD THE IRANIAN TEAM FOR THE FIRST 
JOINT COMMISSION MEETING.  WE KNOW THAT BRUNEI 
KEEPS A CAREFUL EYE ON THE IRANIAN EMBASSY\'S 
ACTIVITIES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT OFFICIAL VISITS 
NOTWITHSTANDING, BRUNEI REMAINS WARY OF IRAN\'S 
ULTIMATE INTENTIONS.  CONSISTENT WITH BRUNEI\'S 
FOREIGN POLICY APPROACH OF \"FRIEND OF ALL, 
ENEMY OF NONE\", HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE GRADUALLY, AND 
CAREFULLY, TO EXPAND.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT:  SULTAN:  BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE US \"EXCELLENT\" 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THERESA A. TULL. 
REASON:  1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  DURING MY APRIL 16 FAREWELL CALL, 
THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI WAS EFFUSIVE IN EXPRESSING 
HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE \"EXCELLENT\" STATE OF 
THE US-BRUNEIAN RELATIONSHIP, AND HIGHLY 
COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT WHAT HE PERCEIVES TO BE MY 
ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THIS.  HE NOTED HIS 
PLEASURE AT HIS APEC CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT 
CLINTON; I SAID I HOPED THAT THE CANCELLED OSAKA 
MEETING COULD BE RESCHEDULED FOR MANILA.  THE 
SULTAN REPEATED HIS APPRECIATION OF THE US 
FORWARD-DEPLOYED PRESENCE IN THE REGION, AND 
INDICATED SOME CONCERN ABOUT RECENT CHINESE 
BEHAVIOR. 
 
3.  I THANKED HIS MAJESTY FOR HIS COOPERATION ON 
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN, AND 
ASKED THAT HE CONSIDER AIDING THE BOSNIAN TRAIN 
AND EQUIP EFFORT.  I ALSO THANKED HIM FOR 
SELECTING THE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER FOR HIS AIR 
FORCE, AND PUT IN A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE 
HARPOON AND SEA SPARROW MISSILE SYSTEMS BEING 
CONSIDERED FOR BRUNEI\'S OFFSHORE PATROL 
VESSELS.  END SUMMARY 
 
4.  I PAID MY FAREWELL CALL ON SULTAN HASSANAL 
BOLKIAH APRIL 16.  THE SULTAN LAUNCHED OUR 
DISCUSSION BY EXPRESSING HIS COMPLETE 
SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE TERMED THE \"VERY 
EXCELLENT\" STATE OF THE US-BRUNEIAN BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  HE SAID THAT THE RELATIONSHIP HAD 
ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD, BUT THAT COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD INCREASED 
MARKEDLY, HE THOUGHT, DURING MY TENURE AS 
AMBASSADOR.  HE THANKED ME FOR WHAT HE PERCEIVED 
TO BE MY ROLE IN THIS ACHIEVEMENT. 
 
PRAISE FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  THE SULTAN RECALLED FONDLY HIS PARTICIPATION 
IN THE BLAKE ISLAND APEC LEADERS MEETING, WHERE 
HE HAD FIRST MET PRESIDENT CLINTON.  HE SAID 
THAT HE LIKED VERY MUCH THE PRESIDENT\'S WARM, 
INFORMAL MANNER, AND REMEMBERED THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TOLD HIM THAT THE TWO WERE VERY 
NEARLY THE SAME AGE.  HE SAID HE HAD WELCOMED 
SEEING THE PRESIDENT AGAIN AT THE BOGOR APEC 
MEETING. 
 
6.  I TOLD THE SULTAN THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD 
REGRETTED HAVING TO CANCEL HIS PARTICIPATION AT 
THE OSAKA APEC MEETING, AND HIS PLANNED 
BILATERAL MEETING WITH THE SULTAN, FOR WHICH THE 
LATTER HAD RESCHEDULED HIS TRIP TO OSAKA.  THE 
SULTAN SAID THAT HE COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THE 
REASON FOR THE THIS.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HOPED 
THAT THE TWO WOULD BE ALBLE TO RESCHEDULE THE 
BILATERAL FOR THE MANILA APEC MEETING, BUT 
CAUTIONED THAT I COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT THLS 
COULD BE ARRANGED. 
 
THE US IS A PROTECTIVE PRESENCE IN THE REGION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  THE SULTAN REPEATED HIS PREVIOUSLY STATED 
APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. FORWARD-DEPLOYED 
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION, WHICH HE SAID 
KEEPS THE REGION STABLE.  HE WELCOMES THE 
PRESENCE OF THE 7TH FLEET IN THE REGION (TWO OF 
WHOSE FRIGATES WILL BE IN BRUNEI APRIL 22-27 FOR 
BILATERAL EXERCISES). 
 
8.  ON CHINA, THE SULTAN SAID THAT THE RECENT 
CHINESE INTIMIDATION OF TAIWAN HAD BEEN A CAUSE 
FOR CONCERN.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS A 
SUPERPOWER, BUT IS WELCOMED AS A HELPFUL 
PRESENCE, IN THE REGION TO PROTECT IT AND 
PROVIDE SECURITY.  CHINA IS SOMETIMES A SOURCE 
OF WORRY TO ITS REGIONAL NEIGHBORS, HE SAID.  HE 
EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE U.S. WOULD PROTECT 
TAIWAN IF NEED BE. 
 
COOPERATION ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, BOSNIA 
TRAIN AND EQUIP 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  I THANKED THE SULTAN FOR HIS HIGH PRAISE OF 
THE STATUS OF THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP, AND CITED 
BRUNEI\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THIS, SUCH AS THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON 
DEFENSE COOPERATION, AND BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION, 
INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, 
ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  I 
SAID THAT MY GOVERNMENT WAS MOST APPRECIATIVE OF 
HIS GOVERNMENT\'S HELP ON KEDO, AID TO THE 
PALESTINIANS, AND ON BOSNIA.  I WELCOMED 
BRUNEI\'S RECENT PLEDGE OF $8 MILLION TO AID 
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN BOSNIA.  I THEN NOTED 
THE CONTINUING NEED FOR FUNDS TO LAUNCH THE 
IMPORTANT BOSNIAN TRAIN AND EQUIP PROGRAM.  I 
SAID THAT I WAS AWARE OF HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
RELUCTANCE TO BREAK WITH TRADITION AND PROVIDE 
MILITARY INSTEAD OF HUMANITARIAN AID, BUT 
SUGGESTED THAT THIS UNIQUE SITUATION MIGHT PROVE 
A WORTHWHILE EXCEPTION TO BRUNEI\'S POLICY, AND 
ASKED THAT HE CONSIDER A CONTRIBUTION.  HE WAS 
NONCOMMITTAL BUT SAID HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE 
BOSNIAN MUSLIMS NEEDED HELP IN THIS REGARD. 
 
MILITARY SALES EFFORTS 
---------------------- 
 
10.  I THANKED THE SULTAN FOR SELECTING 
SIKORSKY\'S BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER FOR HIS AIR 
FORCE.  HE SAID THAT THE BLACKHAWK WAS POWERFUL, 
HE LIKED FLYING HIS, AND HIS AIR FORCE HAD 
WANTED IT.  I THEN MENTIONED THAT TWO U.S. 
MISSILES WERE IN THE RUNNING FOR PLACEMENT, IN 
SEPARATE SYSTEMS, ON BRUNEI\'S OFFSHORE PATROL 
VESSELS, THE HARPOON AND THE SEA SPARROW.  IN A 
VERY LOW-KEY FASHION, I EXPRESSED THE BELIEF 
THAT THESE BIDDERS WOULD RECEIVE A FAIR HEARING, 
AND THE HOPE THAT THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE 
SELECTED.  THE SULTAN WAS NONCOMMITTAL, SAYING 
ONLY THAT A COMMITTEE WAS REVIEWING THESE BIDS 
AND HE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED A RECOMMENDATION. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  THE SULTAN WAS OBVIOUSLY SINCERE IN HIS 
SATISFACTION WITH THE STATE OF THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP, HIS ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT 
CLINTON, AND IN HIS CONTINUING APPRECIATION FOR 
THE POSITIVE ROLE THE U.S. MILITARY PLAYS IN THE 
ASIA PACIFIC REGION.  HIS APPRECIATION LIKELY 
HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED BY HIS ACKNOWLEDGED CONCERN 
ABOUT CHINA\'S RECENT BEHAVIOR. 
 
12.  CONCERN ABOUT CHINA AND APPRECIATION FOR 
THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION ARE 
THEMES WHICH HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN SEVERAL OF 
MY FAREWELL CALL DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR 
OFFICIALS.  THE APRIL 22-27 BILATERAL NAVAL 
EXERCISES HERE WITH TWO FRIGATES OF THE 7TH 
FLEET ARE WELL-TIMED TO PROVIDE WELCOME PHYSICAL 
EVIDENCE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE.  THE BRUNEIANS 
ARE COOPERATING WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN THE WEEK\'S 
PROGRAM, NOT ONLY IN THE ACTUAL EXERCISES 
THEMSELVES, BUT IN HOUSING, FEEDING, AND 
TRANSPORTING A SMALL 7TH FLEET BAND WHICH WILL 
PERFORM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE SHIPS\' STAY. 
THIS UNPREDECENTED LEVEL OF COOPERATION MAY HAVE 
BEEN TRIGGERED IN PART BY UNEASE OVER CHINA. 
 
13.  WE SHOULD NOT TAKE BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION 
WITH THE U.S. ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES FOR 
GRANTED.  THE PERSONAL TOUCH IS MOST IMPORTANT, 
AND THE SULTAN\'S SENSE OF PERSONAL RAPPORT WITH 
THE PRESIDENT IS GENUINE.  THE DECISION LAST 
YEAR TO SEEK A BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE SULTAN DURING THE APEC 
LEADERS\' MEETING, TO THANK HIM FOR THIS 
COOPERATION, WAS A WISE ONE.  I RECOMMEND THAT 
THE BILATERAL MEETING BE RESCHEDULED FOR THE 
PHILIPPINES\' APEC MEETINGS.  IT IS NOT ONLY THE 
POLITE THING TO DO, BUT IT COULD PAY DIVIDENDS 
IN TERMS OF FUTURE COOPERATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO INTERNATIONAL CAUSES SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.

E.O.  12958:  4/25/16 
TAGS: PREL, BX 
SUBJECT:  BRUNEI:  A FRIEND WORTH CULTIVATING 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THERESA A. TULL. 
REASONS:  1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI HAS PROVEN INCREASINGLY 
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT IT IS A FRIEND OF 
THE UNITED STATES, GRATEFUL FOR OUR FORWARD 
DEPLOYED PACIFIC PRESENCE, AND COOPERATIVE IN 
OUR EFFORTS ON SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, 
INCLUDING KEDO, BOSNIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE PROCESS.  FOR VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL 
INVESTMENT IN TIME AND FUNDS, THE UNITED STATES 
COULD ENHANCE ITS BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
BRUNEI AND, I AM CONFIDENT, GENERATE EVEN MORE 
COOPERATION FROM THIS OIL-RICH SULTANATE. 
 
3.  AS I CONCLUDE MY TOUR IN BRUNEI, I RECOMMEND 
(A) THAT THE PRESIDENT GIVE THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI 
SOME \"FACE\" TIME, BEGINNING WITH SCHEDULING A 
BILATERAL ON THE FRINGES OF THE MANILA APEC 
LEADERS MEETING, AND POSSIBLY INCLUDING A 
POST-ELECTION WASHINGTON INVITATION; (B) TO 
FURTHER INCREASE BILATERAL INTERACTION, THAT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFER TO ESTABLISH A JOINT 
COMMISSION WITH BRUNEI, AND THAT SENIOR USG 
OFFICIALS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT 
VISIT BRUNEI OCCASIONALLY, AND THAT THEIR 
BRUNEIAN COUNTERPARTS BE INVITED MORE OFTEN TO 
THE UNITED STATES; AND (C) THAT A MINIMUM 
INTERNATIONAL VISITOR GRANT AND FULBRIGHT 
PROGRAM BE RETAINED FOR BRUNEI, DESPITE USIA 
BUDGET CUTBACKS.  GIVEN THE SULTAN\'S 
PREDISPOSITION TOWARDS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE U.S., THIS MODEST EFFORT WOULD PAY 
DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL COOPERATION, 
INCLUDING FINANCIAL, ON BRUNEI\'S PART IN CAUSES 
OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
U.S. ECLIPSING GREAT BRITAIN AS IMPLICIT 
GUARANTOR OF BRUNEIAN SECURITY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  GREAT BRITAIN CONTINUES TO LOOM LARGE IN 
BRUNEI, WITH THE RESIDUAL GURKHA PRESENCE, ITS 
LOAN OFFICERS IN SERVICE WITH THE BRUNEIAN 
MILITARY, AND THE TIES OF A CENTURY OF THE 
BRITISH PROTECTORATE, REINFORCED BY BRUNEIAN 
LINKS TO BRITISH UNIVERSITIES--AND ASSIDUOUS 
CULTIVATION OF THE WEALTHY SULTAN BY BRITISH 
ROYALTY.  BUT GREAT BRITAIN DOES NOT HAVE THE 
SEVENTH FLEET, AND IS NOT VIEWED AS THE 
STABILIZER OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, OR AS THE 
BENIGN PROVIDER OF SECURITY IN THE UNCERTAIN 
DAYS AHEAD AS CHINA DEVELOPS AS A SUPERPOWER AND 
FLEXES ITS MUSCLES IN THE REGION.  INCREASINGLY 
I SENSE THAT FOR BRUNEI, THE UNITED STATES IS 
REGARDED AS THE ULTIMATE GUARANTOR OF ITS 
SECURITY--NOT THAT BRUNEI NECESSARILY EXPECTS 
THE U.S. TO COME TO THE RESCUE IF INVADED, BUT 
IN THE SENSE THAT THE U.S. PRESENCE, 
PARTICULARLY IN THE FORM OF THE SEVENTH FLEET, 
WILL KEEP POTENTIALLY AGGRESSIVE REGIONAL POWERS 
AT BAY. 
 
5.  BRUNEI\'S APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. PRESENCE 
WAS HEIGHTENED BY CHINA\'S RECENT AGGRESSIVE 
BEHAVIOR TOWARDS TAIWAN.  IN RECENT WEEKS 
SEVERAL SENIOR BRUNEIAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE 
SULTAN, HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN TO ME ABOUT 
CHINA\'S INTENTIONS, AND GRATITUDE FOR THE U.S. 
RESPONSE. 
 
BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. INCREASING 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BRUNEI HAS INCREASED 
ITS COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN KEY AREAS. 
FIRST, WE CONCLUDED A LONG-STALLED NEGOTIATION 
AND IN NOVEMBER 1994 SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF 
UNDERSTANDING ON DEFENSE COOPERATION, ON TERMS 
FAVORABLE TO THE U.S. WITH REGARD TO CRIMINAL 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY 
OFFENDERS--BETTER TERMS, I BELIEVE, THAN 
SINGAPORE WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT.  DESPITE SOME 
RESIDUAL BRUNEIAN NERVOUSNESS THAT THE TINY 
COUNTRY NOT BE SEEN (BY ITS POTENTIALLY 
AGGRESSIVE NORTHERN NEIGHBOR) AS TOO CLOSELY 
LINKED WITH THE UNITED STATES, AT THE VERY TOP 
LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IT WAS DECIDED THAT A CLOSER 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BENIGN PROVIDER OF 
SECURITY IN THE REGION, THE UNITED STATES, WAS 
WORTH THE RISK OF AROUSING CONCERN IN CHINA. 
 
7.  BRUNEI HAS ALSO MARKEDLY INCREASED ITS 
COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN 
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  THE 
COUNTRY HAS RESPONDED GENEROUSLY TO OUR APPEALS 
FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION 
(KEDO), FOR AID TO THE PALESTINIANS IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, 
AND HAS SUPPORTED THE BOSNIAN MUSLIMS, MOST 
RECENTLY WITH A US $8 MILLION DOLLAR PLEDGE FOR 
REFUGEE RELIEF AT THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE. 
 
8.  IN APEC AND IN ASEAN, BRUNEI HAS BEEN 
GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. GOALS.  BRUNEI\'S 
SKILLFUL DIPLOMACY IN THE CRITICAL INITIAL 
STAGES HELPED SHAPE THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM IN 
DIRECTIONS COMPATIBLE WITH U.S. AIMS FOR THIS 
IMPORTANT FORUM. 
 
9.  BRUNEI HAS ALSO GIVEN U.S. BIDDERS VALUABLE 
CONTRACTS IN RECENT MONTHS (SIKORSKY, BOEING 
ARGOSYSTEMS, AIRWAYS ENGINEERING).  MCDONNELL 
DOUGLAS AND RAYTHEON ARE COMPETING FOR SHIPBOARD 
MISSILE SALES AND APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE 
OF WINNING THE CONTRACTS. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE COOPERATION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  ALL OF THIS COOPERATION LEADS TO ONE 
CONCLUSION:  FOR THE U.S., BRUNEI IS 
INCREASINGLY A FRIEND, AND ONE WORTH CULTIVATING 
A BIT MORE THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST.  WITH A 
VERY SMALL INVESTMENT IN TIME, EFFORT, AND 
FUNDS, THE U.S. COULD SOLIDIFY THIS COOPERATION, 
AND MOST LIKELY GAIN MORE, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL 
FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL CAUSES 
OF MUTUAL CONCERN, AND POSSIBLY SOME MORE 
LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS FOR AMERICAN FIRMS. 
 
11.  I OFFER THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 
A.  REQUEST BILATERAL FOR THE SULTAN WITH 
PRESIDENT CLINTON ON THE MARGINS OF THE MANILA 
APEC LEADERS MEETING, TO REPLACE THE ABORTED 
OSAKA BILATERAL.  PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE SO 
IMPORTANT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND PARTICULARLY IN 
BRUNEI.  THE SULTAN FEELS A RAPPORT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE SEATTLE APEC 
LEADERS SUMMIT.  A SMALL MEASURE OF PERSONAL 
CONTACT WITH THE PRESIDENT WOULD MAKE THE SULTAN 
EVEN MORE RESPONSIVE TO OUR APPEALS FOR 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
B.  INVITE THE SULTAN FOR AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON.  I BELIEVE THAT BRUNEI IS THE ONLY 
ASEAN COUNTRY (EXCEPT NEWLY ADMITTED VIETNAM) 
WHOSE HEAD OF STATE AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER HAS 
NOT BEEN INVITED TO WASHINGTON.  ONE RESPECTED 
SENIOR OFFICIAL TOLD ME THAT PERHAPS IF THE 
SULTAN MADE NASTY PUBLIC SPEECHES AGAINST THE 
U.S., HE, LIKE MALAYSIA\'S MAHATIR, MIGHT ALSO BE 
INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.  THE ABSENCE OF AN 
OFFICIAL INVITATION IS AWKWARD BECAUSE THE 
SULTAN WAS IN FACT INVITED ORALLY BY THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF DURING THE SEATTLE LEADERS 
MEETING.  PROVING THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST A 
CASUAL \"HOPE YOU CAN COME TO MY COUNTRY 
SOMETIME\" REMARK, PRESIDENT CLINTON REPEATED THE 
INVITATION TO BRUNEI\'S AMBASSADOR WHEN HE 
PRESENTED CREDENTIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE A 
COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER THE SEATTLE MEETING.  I 
RECOMMEND THAT THE PRESIDENT, IN 1997, EXTEND A 
FORMAL INVITATION TO THE SULTAN TO VISIT 
WASHINGTON. 
 
C.  ESTABLISH A JOINT COMMISSION BETWEEN THE 
U.S. AND BRUNEI TO REVIEW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THE 
OVERALL STATE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
BRUNEI HAS THESE JOINT COMMISSIONS WITH MANY 
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CHINA, OMAN, PAKISTAN, 
ETC.  THE MEETINGS ARE USUALLY CHAIRED AT THE 
PERMANENT SECRETARY LEVEL, AND ARE HELD IN 
ALTERNATE CAPITALS.  THE COMMISSIONS CONSIDER 
WAYS TO ENHANCE COOPERATION IN THE POLITICAL, 
ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL 
FIELDS.  FOR THE U.S., A COMMISSION WOULD BE A 
MEANS TO SHOW BRUNEI THAT WE BELIEVE THE 
RELATIONSHIP TO BE MORE THAN A SERIES OF TIN CUP 
EXERCISES.  IT WOULD BRING THE ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY TO BRUNEI BIANNUALLY FOR BILATERAL 
DISCUSSIONS, GIVING VISIBLE EVIDENCE THAT WE 
CARE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
D.  SCHEDULE MORE FREQUENT VISITS BY SENIOR USG 
CIVILIAN OFFICIALS TO BRUNEI FOR BILATERAL 
DISCUSSIONS.  (U.S. SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS 
VISIT BRUNEI REGULARLY; THESE VISITS SHOULD BE 
MAINTAINED AT CURRENT LEVELS.)  THESE SHOULD 
INCLUDE THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE, DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF STATE (AND THE SECRETARY, IF HE IS 
TOURING THE REGION), THE USTR, AND OUR 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS.  AGAIN, THESE 
OCCASIONAL VISITS WOULD HAVE AS THEIR GOAL 
SIMPLY SHOWING BRUNEI THAT WE DO NOT TAKE THEM 
FOR GRANTED.  WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT IMMEDIATE 
TANGIBLE BENEFITS, BUT OVER TIME SHOWING THAT WE 
TAKE BRUNEI SERIOUSLY WILL, I AM CONFIDENT, PAY 
DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF INCREASED COOPERATION.  AT 
THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD INVITE SENIOR BRUNEIAN 
OFFICIALS TO THE U.S. MORE FREQUENTLY. 
 
E.  FUND A SMALL INTERNATIONAL VISITOR AND 
FULBRIGHT PROGRAM.  USIA STOPPED FUNDING THE 
SMALL USIS EFFORT IN BRUNEI JANUARY 1, 1996. 
BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS EFFORT, I HAVE 
CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN THE RUDIMENTS OF A USIS 
OPERATION, SUCH AS DISTRIBUTING THE WIRELESS 
FILE AND MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH BRUNEI\'S ONE 
UNIVERSITY, DRAWING FROM THE EMBASSY\'S MINISCULE 
BUDGET.  WE HAVE TWO INTERNATIONAL VISITOR 
CANDIDATES IN THE PIPELINE FOR FY-96 PROGRAMS. 
AT PRESENT WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING FULBRIGHT 
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY, AND A SIMILARLY 
OUTSTANDING USIA-PROVIDED LIBRARY FELLOW HELPING 
TO ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY AT THE NEW UNIVERSITY 
CAMPUS.  THE BRUNEIAN GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR ALL 
EXPENSES FOR THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS, EXCEPT FOR 
THEIR STIPEND.  DESPITE USIA\'S SHRINKING BUDGET, 
FUNDS SHOULD BE FOUND TO CONTINUE A MODEST IV 
AND FULBRIGHT PROGRAM HERE.  THREE IV GRANTS PER 
YEAR, AND ONE FULBRIGHTER, WOULD COST THE USG NO 
MORE THAN $100,000 PER YEAR, AND WOULD BE MONEY 
WELL SPENT.  EXPOSURE TO THE US BY MID-LEVEL 
BRUNEIAN OFFICIALS, AND THE REGULAR INCLUSION OF 
A FULBRIGHT PROFESSOR ON THE FACULTY OF THE 
UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE 
TO \"ISLAMICIZE\", YET WANTS TO EXPAND AND GROW 
ACADEMICALLY, WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT. 
FURTHER, STOPPING THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE VIEWED 
BY THE BRUNEIAN GOVERNMENT AS A SNUB AND COULD 
IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON THEIR WILLINGNESS TO 
INCREASE COOPERATION WITH US IN OTHER AREAS. 
 
12.  THESE ARE MODEST PROPOSALS--A LITTLE FACE 
TIME, A MODEST USIA EFFORT.  I URGE THAT THEY BE 
FAVORABLY CONSIDERED, AND WISH MY SUCCESSOR WELL 
IN BRINGING THEM TO FRUITION.

TO THE REGION\'S PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  HE ALSO 
EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE BROADER 
U.S.-BRUNEI BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  ADMIRAL 
NATTER EXPLAINED THE USG\'S CURRENT DEFENSE 
PROFILE IN ASIA AND EXCHANGED VIEWS ON HOW TO 
IMPROVE SECURITY RELATIONS WITH CHINA.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, SULTAN 
BOLKIAH COMMENTED ON THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS 
THAT EXIST BETWEEN BRUNEI AND THE U.S.  HE WAS 
PARTICULARLY PLEASED BY THE GROWING 
MILITARY-TO-MILITARY TIES.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT 
HE HAS ALWAYS VIEWED THE U.S. PRESENCE IN 
SOUTHEAST ASIA AS ESSENTIAL TO THE REGION\'S 
PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  HE SAID THAT HE WELCOMES 
OUR ROLE IN ASIA AND WAS CERTAIN THAT SOUTHEAST 
ASIA\'S OTHER LEADERS SHARE THIS VIEW, IF NOT 
ALWAYS PUBLICALLY. 
 
4.  ADMIRAL NATTER SAID THAT THE USG WELCOMES 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COOPERATE WITH BRUNEI\'S ARMED 
FORCES AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATES BRUNEI\'S OPEN 
EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. PRESENCE IN 
ASIA.  HE NOTED BY WAY OF EXAMPLE OF THE U.S. 
ROLE THAT U.S. NAVY AND MARINES ARE PREPARED FOR 
ACTION IN CAMBODIA TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS 
AND TO ASSIST IN EVACUATION IF THAT BECOMES A 
NECESSITY.  THE ADMIRAL ADDED THAT THE IMMEDIATE 
CRISIS NOW SEEMS TO BE OVER AND WE HAVE HAD NO 
NEED TO CALL ON THE NAVY AND MARINES.  BUT THEY 
ARE READY IF NEEDED.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT HE 
VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE USG\'S QUICK RESPONSE 
TO THE RECENT EVENTS IN CAMBODIA. 
 
5.  ADMIRAL NATTER COMMENTED THAT HIS PRIORITY 
AREA OF CONCERN IS MONITORING EVENTS IN NORTH 
KOREA.  HOWEVER, CHINA REMAINS THE ISSUE OF 
LONG-TERM CONCERN.  THE ADMIRAL SAID THE USG 
GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN OUR STRENGTH IN ASIA WHILE 
BUILDING CLOSER, MORE COOPERATIVE TIES WITH 
CHINA.  CHINA REMAINS SUSPICIOUS OF THE U.S. 
MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN AND SEEMS 
UNWILLING TO BELIEVE THAT OUR AGREEMENTS WITH 
JAPAN LIMIT THEIR NEED TO BUILD AND PROJECT 
GREATER MILITARY STRENGTH -- SOMETHING CHINA 
WOULD NOT WELCOME.  HE ASKED FOR THE SULTAN\'S 
VIEWS ON HOW TO WORK WITH CHINA. 
 
6.  THE SULTAN SAID THAT CHINA IS HEAVILY 
FOCUSED ON DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
WANTS NOTHING TO INTERFERE WITH GROWTH.  THEY 
SEE ANY STRONG MILITARY IN THE REGION AS A 
POTENTIAL THREAT THAT HAS TO BE COUNTERED.  HE 
FELT THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH CHINA\'S 
LEADERS IS THROUGH CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT.  IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA THAT THE U.S. AND 
CHINA (AND JAPAN) WORK TOWARDS MUTUAL 
UNDERSTANDING.  THE SULTAN ARGUED THAT AS CHINA 
GROWS ECONOMICALLY, IT WILL HAVE A GREATER 
INTEREST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\'S STABILITY? 
 
7.  IN CLOSING, ADMIRAL NATTER INVITED THE 
SULTAN TO VISIT ONE OF TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS 
THAT WILL BE IN THE REGION OVER THE NEXT TWO 
MONTHS.  SULTAN BOLKIAH SAID HE WOULD BE 
DELIGHTED IF THE TIMING CAN BE WORKED OUT. 
 
8.  THE U.S. ATTENDEES FOR THE MEETING WERE VICE 
ADMIRAL NATTER, AMBASSADOR RASE AND COMMANDER 
PORTER.  THE SULTAN WAS SUPPORTED BY HIS 
MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, PEHIN ISA (WHO 
TRANSLATED FOR THE SULTAN), ACTING ROYAL BRUNEI 
ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, GENERAL ABIDIN, AND THE 
PERM SEC FOR POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION, PEHIN 
ABDUL RAHMAN.

SUBJECT: ASIAWEEK\'S \"BRUNEI FUN?\" ARTICLE 
CAUSES A STIR 
 
1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  A LONG ARTICLE 
ENTITLED \"BRUNEI FUN?\" APPEARED IN THE 
SEPTEMBER 12 ISSUE OF ASIAWEEK MAGAZINE.  IN 
THE ARTICLE, SENIOR ASIAWEEK CORRESPONDENT 
ROGER MITTEN, EXAMINES CURRENT TRENDS IN 
BRUNEI SOCIETY, POLITICS, CULTURE, AND THE 
BRUNEI ROYAL FAMILY.  THE CONTEXT OF THE 
ARTICLE IS TNE BRUNEI GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO 
PROMOTE THE COUNTRY, A SELF-LABELED 
CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM MONARCHY,  AS A TOURIST 
DESTINATION, AND THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF 
VALUES THIS REVEALS. 
 
2.  THE THRUST OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT BRUNEI 
IS LIBERALIZING SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY, AND 
THAT THIS LOOSENING UP HAS TACIT APPROVAL 
FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, I.E. 
THE SULTAN HIMSELF, BUT IT IS MLTTEN\'S 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE 
SULTAN, PRINCE JEFRI AND PRINCE MOHAMED WHICH 
ARE PROVOKING CONTROVERSY.  MITTEN STATES 
THAT PRINCE JEFRI DID NOT STEP DOWN AS 
FINANCE MINISTER, EARLIER THIS YEAR, BUT WAS 
SACKED BY THE SULTAN FOR FINANCIAL 
MISDEALINGS IN CONNECTION WITH JEFRI\'S MEGA- 
CORPORATION - AMEDEO.  MITTEN ALSO REPORTS ON 
PRINCE JEFRI\'S ALLEGED PHILANDERING AND THE 
MISS USA CASE.  IT IS SURPRISING THAT MITTEN 
NAMES BRUNEI GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR 
OFFICIALS AS SOURCES, QUOTING THEIR UNUSUALLY 
CANDID COMMENTS ON  THE SULTAN\'S WEALTH, 
BRUNEI\'S ILLICIT NIGHT LIFE, INTERNAL 
SECURITY, BOOTLEGGING AND PRESS FREEDOM. 
THE ARTICLE CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE 
HOMEPAGE OF ASIAWEEK MAGAZINE ON THE 
INTERNET, BUT COMMERICAL COPIES OF THE 
MAGAZINE HAVE BEEN WITHHELD BY THE GOB. 
EMBOFF HEARD EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT THE GOB 
PLANNED TO RESPOND TO THE ASIAWEEK ARTICLE, 
AN UNUSUAL MOVE IN ITSELF, AND THE GOB DID SO 
ON SEPTEMBER 19 IN A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE IN 
THE BORNEO BULLETIN, WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT OF 
SEPTEL.  POST IS TRANSMITTING THE ASIAWEEK 
ARTICLE IN FULL, DESPITE ITS LENGTH, TO GIVE 
WASHINGTON A FLAVOR OF THE CURRENT BRUNEI 
SCENE. 
 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
3.  SEPTEMBER 12, 1997 - FUN BRUNEI? 
 
MIDNIGHT, THURSDAY. A DIM RESTAURANT FULL OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE ON A SIDE STREET IN GADONG, JUST 
OUTSIDE BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, CAPITAL OF 
BRUNEI. PORTRAITS OF THE COUNTRY\'S RULER, 
SULTAN RASSANAL BOLKIAH, AND HIS TWO WIVES, 
SALEHA AND MARIAM, HANG ON THE WALL. CALLED 
\'HIS MAJESTY\' OR PLAIN \'HM,\' HIS BENIGN 
VISAGE GAZES DOWN ON THE SMOKY ROOM. THERE IS 
MUSIC MIXED WITH CHATTER AND LAUGHTER. 
FILIPINO WAITRESSES BANTER WITH THE GUYS; 
COUPLES GAZE INTO EACH OTHER\'S EYES. SOME 
ORDER \"SPECIAL TEA\" -- BEER SERVED IN CUPS 
FROM A TEAPOT. INELEGANT, PERHAPS, BUT IN 
\"DRY\" BRUNEI, BEER IS BEER. NEXT DOOR, THE 
DRAPES OF ANOTHER EATERY ARE DRAWN; THE 
TABLES AND CHAIRS SHOVED AGAINST THE WALLS. 
LOUDER, FUNKIER MUSIC BEGINS AND THE GUYS AND 
GALS BEGIN TO BOOGIE. IT\'S ALL DONE BEHIND 
CURTAINS AND WITH A LOOKOUT; BUT, STILL, THIS 
IS THE ALLEGEDLY STAID AND ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE 
ISLAMIC SULTANATE OF BRUNEI. WHAT GIVES? 
ALTHOUGH THE SCENE IS NOT YET COMMON, IT IS 
ONE OF MANY SIGNS THAT THIS TINY, OIL-RICH 
NATION ON THE NORTHWEST COAST OF BORNEO IS 
LOOSENING UP. THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. HM\'S 
GOVERNMENT IS PROACTIVELY \"SELLING\" HIS 
COUNTRY AS A FUN PLACE TO VISIT. IN BANDAR\'S 
NEWEST MALL, EURO-CHIC IS AVAILABLE AT TRENDY 
BOUTIQUES -- ALL DISPLAYING SEXY WINDOW ADS 
THAT WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE IN PARIS OR 
NEW YORK. THERE ARE SWISH ITALIAN. JAPANESE 
AND SICHUAN RESTAURANTS ALONGSIDE THE USUAL 
MCDONALD\'S, PIZZA HUT AND DELIFRANCE. THERE\'S 
A CYBER CAFE;. CAFFEINE ADDICTS CAN PARTAKE 
IN 24-HOUR COFFEE SHOPS. BOOKSTORES SELL 
FOREIGN TITLES THAT GET PAST TNE CENSORS 
FASTER THAN IN MALAYSIA OR INDONESIA. 
 
4.  A NEW CINEPLEX WILL SOON OPEN TO 
COMPLEMENT BANDAR\'S TWO CINEMAS (REMEMBER, 
THIS IS A TOWN OF ONLY 55,000 PEOPLE). 
CAPITAL GOLD, WITH ITS OUTRAGEOUS, CAMPY DJS, 
BLARES ON CAR RADIOS REAL-TIME DIRECT FROM 
LONDON. THANKS TO UNFETTERED SATELLITE TV, 
THERE\'S LOTS OF CHOICE ON THE TUBE. VIDEO 
SHOPS RENT CURRENT MOVIES. SKIMPILY CLAD 
WHITNEY HOUSTON AND PELVIS-THRUSTING MICHAEL 
JACKSON (WHO HAD PROBLEMS IN NEIGHBORING 
MALAYSIA), HAVE BOTH PERFORMED WITHOUT HASSLE 
AT BRUNEI\'S FAMED DISNEYLAND-TYPE JERUDONG 
PARK -- WHICH STILL PAYS TRIBUTE TO WACKO 
JACKO NIGHTLY IN A SPECTACULAR LASER SHOW. 
 
5.  MALAYSIAN LAWYER V.L. KANDAN RECENTLY 
VISITED BRUNEI FOR TNE FIRST TIME IN 10 
YEARS. HE WAS BLOWN AWAY. \"THE CHANGE IS 
FANTASTIC. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE THINGS TO 
SEE. JERUDONG PARK IS WONDERFUL, THE BEST IN 
SOUTHEAST ASIA.\" A WESTERN DIPLOMAT EXPLAINS 
WHAT\'S HAPPENING: \"ALL THESE THINGS -- STAR 
TV, CAPITAL RADIO, THE FEISTIER BORNEO 
BULLETIN, THE ASEAN AND APEC MEETINGS -- ARE 
CHANGING BRUNEI FOR THE BETTER.\" THIS IS NO 
FULL-BORE PERESTROIKA. BUT IT\'S A DISTINCT 
THAW. IF NOT EVERYBODY IS JUMPING IN WITH 
BOTH FEET, MANY ARE AT LEAST DIPPING A TOE. 
 
6.  TAKE ALCOHOL. OFFICIALLY, BRUNEI WENT DRY 
IN 1991. YET BEER IS EASY TO GET, HARD LIQUOR 
NOT MUCN MORE DIFFICULT, WINE TOUGHER BECAUSE 
FEW LOCALS DRINK IT -- ALTHOUGH SPIFFY DEALS 
RESTAURANT AT THE SHERATON WILL DISPENSE WITH 
THE TEACUP CHARADE AND PROVIDE WINE GLASSES 
AND AN ICE BUCKET FOR THE BRING-YOUR-OWN 
CROWD. \"I DON\'T KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM 
BUYING BEER,\" SAYS PETER STEELE, MD OF BRUNEI 
OIL OPERATIONS FOR NEW ZEALAND\'S FLETCHER 
CHALLENGE. \"YOU ORDER A CASE FOR $50 OR $60; 
IT\'S DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME.\" MOST OF IT 
COMES BY BOAT FROM LIMBANG, DOWNRIVER IN EAST 
MALAYSIA\'S SARAWAK STATE. 
 
7.  ASIDE FROM OIL AND GAS, BOOTLEGGING IS 
BRUNEI\'S THRIVINGEST INDUSTRY. TOURISM CHIEF 
SHEIKH JAMALUDDIN MOHAMED ALLOWS \"WE MAKE 
BOOTLEGGERS RICH.\" GRAVEL BARGES SMUGGLE IN 
THOUSANDS OF CASES OF BEER. \"GO TO THE 
BEACH,\" SAYS BANDAR LAWYER AHMAD ISA, SON OF 
HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER ISA IBRAHIM. \"YOU\'LL 
SEE THAI WORKERS OPENLY DRINKING CANS OF 
HEINEKEN AND EXPATS AND TOURISTS WITH BULGING 
ICE COOLERS. IS IT A BIG DEAL?\" 
 
8.  BANDAR MAYOR RAHMAN MOHIDDIN SEEMS TO 
THINK IT IS. \"TNERE SHOULD BE NO DRINKING,\" 
HE SAYS. \"WE CANNOT BE GOOD MUSLIMS AND ALLOW 
DRINKING IN PUBLIC PLACES. IN PRIVATE, IT IS 
OKAY.\" FOR NOW, ESPECIALLY SINCE MUSLIMS 
RARELY HIT THE BEACH OR DINE AT DEALS, THE 
SURREPTITIOUS IMBIBING RARELY CAUSES OFFENSE. 
BUT RESTAURATEURS EXPLOIT THE UNOFFICIAL 
LAXITY AT THEIR OWN RISK. TRENDY ITALIAN 
EATERY FRATINI\'S EARNED AN OFFICIAL WARNING 
FOR ALLOWING BYO CUSTOMERS TO INDULGE TOO 
OVERTLY. 
 
9.  THE WARNINGS MAY BECOME REDUNDANT, THANKS 
TO THE TOURISM THRUST. BRUNEI WANTS TO 
ATTRACT FAMILIES, BUT EVEN VACATIONING MUMS 
AND DADS LIKE TO WINE AND DINE. SOON THEY MAY 
BE ABLE TO, WHEN THE FIVE-STAR JERUDONG 
RESORT HOTEL OPENS LATER THIS YEAR. BUILT BY 
AMEDEO DEVELOPMENT, A COMPANY RUN BY HM\'S 
BROTHER, PRINCE JEFRI, IT WILL LIKELY PROVIDE 
ALCOHOL AND ENTERTAINMENT. 
 
10.  THE SULTAN, 51, INHERITED THE THRONE 
UPON HIS FATHER\'S ABDICATION IN 1967. BESIDES 
JEFRI, HE HAS SIX SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS, 
PRINCE MOHAMED, THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AND 
PRINCE SUFRI, WHO IS ILL AND PLAYS A 
PERIPHERAL ROLE IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS. HM CAME 
TO POWER FIVE YEARS AFTER A BRIEF FLIRTATION 
WITH DEMOCRACY; WHEN THE FIRST AND ONLY POLL 
IN 1962 TURNED VIOLENT, THE VICTORIOUS BRUNEI 
PEOPLE\'S PARTY WAS BANNED AND THE 
CONSTITUTION SUSPENDED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY 
REMAINS TO THIS DAY. 
 
11.  INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, PEOPLE ARE 
WILLING TO TALK OPENLY ABOUT POLITICS AND 
OFFICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY. HM HIMSELF SPOKE ON 
THE SUBJECT DURING A VISIT TO KUALA LUMPUR 
LAST WEEK. AS THE 21ST CENTURY DAWNS, THE 
SULTAN KNOWS ABSOLUTIST RULE CAN\'T LAST. 
THERE HAS BEEN OFFICIAL TALK ABOUT ADOPTING 
LIMITED DEMOCRACY. HM APPARENTLY FAVORS THE 
CHINA TRAJECTORY: ENRICHMENT, THEN, CAREFULLY 
CIRCUMSCRIBED POLLS. INSIDERS SAY HM IS 
GRADUALLY LOOSENING HIS GRIP ON LIFESTYLES 
AND THE MEDIA SO PEOPLE CAN GET ACQUAINTED 
WITH THE ISSUES AND, AT SOME POINT, VOTE 
INTELLIGENTLY. 
 
12.  CERTAINLY, MORE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO 
SPEAK OUT. ASIDE FROM A MALAY-LANGUAGE 
WEEKLY, THERE IS ONLY THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE 
BORNEO BULLETIN (THERE ARE NO BRUNEI CHINESE 
PAPERS). GIVEN HEAVY MEDIA RESTRICTIONS, THE 
BULLETIN IS ADMIRED FOR PUSHING THE ENVELOPE 
-- PARTICULARLY IN ITS ACERBIC LETTERS PAGE. 
CRITICAL LETTERS ARE TOLERATED BECAUSE THE 
PAPER IS OWNED BY HM\'S BROTHER, PRINCE 
MOHAMED, AND BECAUSE IT ACTS AS AN ESCAPE 
VALVE THAT LETS AUTHORITIES KNOW WHERE THE 
NATIONAL PRESSURE POINTS ARE. 
 
13.  NOT THAT THE BULLETIN IS UNCAGED. 
RECENTLY, IT REPORTED THAT AN ISSUE OF ASIA 
TIMES MAGAZINE (A SUPPLEMENT IN THE WIDELY 
SOLD SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES), HAD BEEN 
BANNED OVER AN ARTICLE DEEMED INCOMPATIBLE 
WITH SOCIETY. EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO 
KNOW WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. \"WE WONDERED,\" 
RECALLS A DIPLOMAT, \"IF IT WAS ANOTHER STORY 
ABOUT JEFRI\'S WOMANIZING OR HM\'S RICHES, OR 
WHAT?\" IT TURNED OUT THAT TNE ITEM WAS SEEN 
TO GLORIFY DRINKING. THE HOME AFFAIRS 
MINISTRY CHASTISED THE BULLETIN FOR REVEALING 
THE BAN. THE INTERNAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT 
(ISD) WANTED TO KNOW IF THE EDITOR WAS TRYING 
TO STIR UP TROUBLE. 
 
14.  LATER, ISD MEN VISITED THE BULLETIN\'S 
OFFICES TO DEMAND ADDRESSES OF READERS WHO 
HAD WRITTEN LETTERS COMPLAINING ABOUT 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND PUBLIC UTILITIES. \"IF 
WE\'D COMPLIED.\" SAID AN EDITORIAL STAFFER, 
\"THEY\'D HAVE GIVEN THESE PEOPLE A HARD TIME.\" 
WITHOUT BULLETIN OWNER PRINCE MOHAMED\'S 
BACKING, EDITORS PROBABLY WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO 
STAND UP TO ISD STAFF AND CONTINUE PRINTING 
SUCH LETTERS. ANOTHER SIGN BRUNEI IS OPENING 
UP. 
 
15.  THE LETTERS ARE SURPRISINGLY TRENCHANT; 
READERS WAX INDIGNANT ABOUT SERVICES IN RURAL 
AREAS -- WATER AND POWER SUPPLY TO VILLAGES 
IS ERRATIC. MANY COMPLAINTS RELATE TO 
TRAFFIC, ESPECIALLY ARBITRARY ROAD BLOCKS, 
DELAYED CAR TAX REFUNDS, HIGH PARKING FEES, 
STEEP CAB FARES ($26 FROM THE AIRPORT TO 
NEARBY BANDAR) AND THE 20T-200T INCREASE IN 
VEHICLE PURCHASE TAX INTRODUCED IN 1995. 
OTHERS LAMENT PHONE CHARGES, GRAFT, RED TAPE 
AND CIVIL SERVICE PAY. 
 
16.  THIS NEW WILLINGNESS TO CRITICIZE 
AUTHORITY CAN GET PRETTY INTENSE. WHEN 
CUSTOMERS AT PIZZA HUT DISCOVERED THAT THE 
CHICKEN TOPPING WAS UNAVAILABLE \"DUE TO A 
TEMPORARY SHORTAGE,\" THEY TURNED THEIR SCORN 
ON A GOVERNMENT DECREE THAT ONLY HALAL 
CHICKEN (SLAUGHTERED THE MUSLIM WAY) COULD BE 
IMPORTED. THE DICTAT WAS FINE IN PRINCIPLE, 
EXCEPT SUFFICIENT HALAL SUPPLIES HAD NOT BEEN 
ARRANGED. WITH THE CURBS IMPOSED ON WESTERN 
CHICKEN AND THE HALAL SUPPLY FROM MALAYSIA 
UNABLE TO MEET DEMAND, THERE WAS A SHORTFALL. 
SO NO CHICKEN PIZZAS. BOOTLEGGERS NOW HAVE A 
NEW WAY TO GET RICH: SMUGGLING POULTRY. 
 
INCREASINGLY BRUNEIANS DARE TO DISCUSS 
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS -- THOUGH THEY RELY ON 
OUTSIDE SOURCES TO GET THEIR INFORMATION. 
CRITICAL COVERAGE OF REGIONAL ISSUES IS 
SIMPLY NOT PERMITTED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. \"WE 
DON\'T CARRY NEWS ON ASEAN THAT REFLECTS 
NEGATIVELY ON THE GROUP,\" SAYS BADARUDDIN 
GHANI. WHO RUNS RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI. \"A 
PROTEST ABOUT EAST TIMOR WOULD BE IGNORED.\" 
 
17.  AS FOR HM, WELL, HE IS A CLOSED BOOK -- 
CERTAINLY IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. OUTSIDERS KNOW 
MORE ABOUT HIM THAN HIS OWN SUBJECTS DO, AND 
TOURISM CHIEF JAMALUDDIN WANTS TO EXPLOIT THE 
RECOGNITION FACTOR. \"WHAT\'S THE FIRST THING 
THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF BRUNEI?\" 
HE ASKS. \"THE SULTAN. THE WORLD\'S RICHEST MAN 
AND ALL THAT.\" JAMALUDDIN OFFERS THIS SLOGAN: 
\"VISIT THE LAND OF THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, THIS 
IS HIS HOME.\" AT HOME, HOWEVER, BRUNEIANS 
PREFER TO RESPECT THE MONARCH\'S PRIVACY. 
LAWYER AHMAD ISA ASKS: \"WHY DO WE NEED TO 
KNOW ABOUT HM?\" 
 
18.  WELL, PERHAPS BECAUSE HE IS KING, PM, 
DEFENSE MINISTER, FINANCE MINISTER, COMMANDER 
OF THE ARMED FORCES, HEAD OF THE ROYAL BRUNEI 
POLICE, THE PETROLEUM UNIT, BROADCASTING, 
INFORMATION SERVICES, AND SUPREME HEAD OF 
ISLAM IN BRUNEI. NOT TO MENTION ALL THAT 
DOUGH: $3B BILLION AT LAST COUNT. (LAST WEEK 
HIS GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY SPENT HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS TO HELP REVERSE THE SLIDE OF THE 
MALAYSIAN AND SINGAPORE CURRENCIES.) HM HAS A 
FLEET OF PLANES, INCLUDING BOEINGS AND AN 
AIRBUS, PARKED IN HIS OWN TERMINAL. ASKED 
WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT ALL THIS, PROMINENT 
BUSINESSMAN RAZALI JOHARI\'S RESPONSE IS 
PRETTY TYPICAL. \"WHY SHOULDN\'T HM HAVE SO 
MUCH MONEY?\" HE SAYS. \"IT\'S HIS COUNTRY. HE 
CAN DO NO WRONG.\" IF THE SULTAN IS CRITICIZED 
AT ALL, IT IS USUALLY FOR NOT REINING IN HIS 
FAMILY. 
 
NOTHING RILES CONSERVATIVES LIKE PRINCE 
JEFRI\'S PENCHANT FOR BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, HIS 
FINANCIAL DEALINGS AND HIS SON HAKIM, WHO 
SHARES HIS FATHER\'S PASSIONS. IT IS AN OPEN 
SECRET THAT WOMEN ARE FLOWN IN TO THE PALACES 
TO \"ENTERTAIN.\" SHANNON MARKETIC, A FORMER 
MISS U.S.A., MADE GLOBAL HEADLINES WITH 
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY BRUNEI ROYALS. 
THE COCKTAIL CIRCUIT HABITUDS TALK ABOUT IT, 
BUT IT\'S NOT MUCH DISCUSSED ON THE STREET 
BECAUSE THE LOCAL MEDIA IGNORED IT. HM DENIES 
THE CHARGES AND LAST MONTH A U.S. COURT RULED 
HE HAD SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY: IT REMAINED TO BE 
SEEN WHETHER BROTHER JEFRI WOULD MERIT THE 
SAME IMMUNITY. 
 
19.  THE CASE IS UNUSUAL SINCE MOST WOMEN 
INVITED TO THE SULTANATE ARE PAID WELL AND 
DON\'T COMPLAIN. ONE AMBASSADOR HAS SEEN IT 
ALL TOO OFTEN. HE RECALLS \"A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, 
NOT TOO INTELLIGENT\" WHO WAS HIRED AS A \"PR 
ASSISTANT\" FOR A ROYAL. SHE TOLD HIM SHE 
\"LOVED WORKING\" IN BRUNEI. IN THE MORNINGS. 
SHE AND HER COLLEAGUES WERE FREE TO DO AS 
THEY PLEASED, MAYBE PLAY TENNIS OR SWIM. 
AFTER A NAP, THEY APPLIED COSMETICS AND SPENT 
THE EVENINGS ENTERTAINING. THE PR ASSISTANT, 
SAYS THE AMBASSADOR, NEVER DEFINED 
\"ENTERTAIN.\" 
 
20.  WHATEVER IT IS, HM SEEMS TO TOLERATE IT. 
\"I THINK PERHAPS HE DOESN\'T ALWAYS KNOW,\" 
SAYS ONE DIPLOMAT. \"THERE ARE JUST SO MANY 
PEOPLE IN THE ROYAL FAMILY. THOUGH JEFRI HAS 
BEEN THE MOST BLATANT.\" FOREIGN MINISTER 
MOHAMED, THE MOST RELIGIOUS OF HM\'S THREE 
BROTHERS, HAS APPARENTLY EXPRESSED WORRY 
ABOUT JEFRI\'S DECADENT BEHAVIOR (PERHAPS BEST 
EXEMPLIFIED BY HIS LUXURY YACHT TITS, WITH 
ITS TWO LIFEBOATS NIPPLE 1 AND NIPPLE 2). 
\"OKAY, IT\'S FAMILY,\" SAYS A BUSINESSMAN. \"BUT 
IF HM WANTS TO STOP THIS KIND OF THING, HE 
SHOULD CRACK THE WHIP.\" 
 
IN FEBRUARY, HE DID -- ABRUPTLY SACKING JEFRI 
AS FINANCE MINISTER AND STRIPPING HIM OF HIS 
OTHER GOVERNMENT POSTS. IT STUNNED BRUNEIANS, 
MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS HM\'S BROTHER AND ALSO 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST CABINET CHANGE IN 10 
YEARS. WHILE BRUNEIANS WERE DENIED A CREDIBLE 
EXPLANATION, THE WORD AMONG COGNOSCENTI IS 
THAT JEFRI WENT DOWN NOT SO MUCH FOR ALLEGED 
PHILANDERING BUT BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL 
PROBLEMS INVOLVING HIS COMPAMY, AMEDEO 
DEVELOPMENT CORP. 
 
21.  FOREIGN CONSULTANTS INVOLVED IN THE WORK 
SAY THE AMEDEO SITUATION RELATES TO SO-CALLED 
ISTANA PROJECTS. FOR THESE, GOVERNMENT FUNDS 
ARE APPORTIONED FOR WORK ON ROYAL PALACES. 
OWING TO ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEMS, HM PUT A 
STOP TO ALL ISTANA PROJECTS. NOW A LOT OF 
CONTRACTORS ARE OUT OF POCKET. THE SULTAN 
TOOK OVER THE FINANCE PORTFOLIO HIMSELF AND 
REPORTEDLY BROUGHT IN BRITISH AUDITORS TO 
SORT OUT THE MESS. THEN HE TURNED HIS GAZE ON 
OTHER MINISTERS, DROPPING BY TO SEE WHAT THEY 
WERE UP TO. 
 
22.  SINCE JEFRI WAS AN ADVOCATE OF LOOSENING 
UP. HIS FALL CAUSED A HICCUP IN PLANS TO EASE 
CONTROLS ON EVERYTHING FROM ALCOHOL TO THE 
MEDIA. BEING A FUN-LOVING SORT, HIS 
TRANSGRESSIONS HAVE BOLSTERED THE 
CONSERVATIVES. SO THE OPENING OF THE LICENSED 
RESORT AT JERUDONG HAS BEEN POSTPONED. AND 
BANDAR MAYOR RAHMAN WILL ISSUE NO MORE 
PERMITS FOR VIDEO-GAME ARCADES (THERE ARE 
ONLY FOUR ). \"THAT\'S WHERE KIDS GET INTO 
TROUBLE,\" HE SAYS. \"I\'M GLAD WE HAVE NO 
DISCOS OR KARAOKE LOUNGES, NO BEAUTY 
PAGEANTS.\" 
 
23.  OF COURSE. SUCH RESTRICTIONS DRIVE MORE 
YOUNG PEOPLE TO BEER-IN-A-TEAPOT HANGOUTS AND 
UNOFFICIAL DISCOS. PACKS OF KIDS AIMLESSLY 
TROLL THE MALLS IN THEIR BACKWARD BASEBALL 
CAPS, BAGGY JEANS AND SNEAKERS. CODDLED BY A 
WELFARE STATE, YOUTHS REFUSE MENIAL JOBS AND 
LOITER IN GANGS. \"THEY ARE DROPOUTS WHO 
FAILED THEIR SCHOOL EXAMS,\" SAYS MUSA 
MOHIDDIN, AN EXECUTIVE WITH ROYAL BRUNEI 
AIRLINES. \"THEY WON\'T DO JOBS DONE BY THAIS 
AND BANGLADESHIS.\" UNEMPLOYMENT IS OFFICIALLY 
4.7, BUT AMONG YOUTHS IT IS AT LEAST DOUBLE 
THAT. 
 
24.  IN JULY TWO GANGS OF PUNKS HAD A RUMBLE 
IN THE YAYASAN SULTAN MALL. IT WAS MORE FOR 
SHOW THAN A REAL GANG TANGLE, BUT MANY FEAR 
THESE UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS WILL BE INTO DRUGS 
AND CRLME SOON -- IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY. 
\"THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM,\" SAYS A LAWYER, 
\"YOUNG KIDS TAKING MARIJUANA, ECSTASY.\" A NEW 
DRUG REHAB CENTER HAS OPENED IN GADONG 
SUBURB. 
 
25.  THE ROOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS BRUNEI\'S 
ECONOMIC RELIANCE ON OIL AWD GAS. CAREER 
OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED. WITH INCREASED 
TECHNOLOGY, THERE IS LESS DEMAND FOR LABOR. 
HENCE, THE CONSTANT CALLS BY EVERYONE FROM HM 
DOWN TO DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY. THE LATEST 
ATTEMPT IS THE PUSH TO TURN BRUNEI INTO A 
TOURIST HAVEN -- WHICH MEANS OPENING UP SO 
PEOPLE WANT TO VISIT. 
 
26.  OF COURSE, THERE ARE LIMITS. \"YOU WANT 
SEX HOLIDAYS,\" CHUCKLES TOURISM DIRECTOR 
JAMALUDDIN. \"GO TO A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY.\" 
MAYOR RAHMAN SAYS \"THERE IS NO HANKY PANKY IN 
BANDAR.\" ACTUALLY, THERE IS -- AND NOT JUST 
IN THE PALACES. HOOKERS AND TRANSVESTITES 
HANG OUT AT VARIOUS LOCALES AROUND TOWN. MOST 
ARE ETHNIC CHINESE FROM MALAYSIA AND 
INDONESIA. ONE WESTERN CONSTRUCTION MANAGER 
ARRANGES \"VISITING RIGHTS\" FOR WOMEN TO KEEP 
HIS THAI AND BANGLADESHI WORKERS HAPPY. 
 
27.  RISING CRIME IS ANOTHER MATTER. 
BRUNEIANS WERE JOLTED THIS YEAR WHEN A GANG 
ROBBED THE TIONG HIN SUPERSTORE AND SHOT DEAD 
ONE OF THE OWNER\'S FAMILY. EVEN MORE 
SHOCKING: THREE OF THE FELONS WERE SECURITY 
GUARDS. \"THEY\'LL BE HANGED,\" SAYS A LAWYER. 
BUT STERN PUNISHMENTS SEEM NO DETERRENT. 
PETTY THEFTS AND CAR-JACKINGS ARE ON THE 
RISE. THESE DAYS, FAMILIES TAKE FEW CHANCES: 
THERE ARE SECURITY BARS ON MOST WINDOWS. SAYS 
A DIPLOMAT: \"BRUNEI ISN\'T AS SAFE AS IT USED 
TO BE.\" 
 
28.  NOR IS IT AS ISLAMIC. FRIDAY IS A 
HOLIDAY, BUT SHOPS OPEN AND OTHER BUSINESS 
GOES ON. THERE IS NO SEGREGATION OF SEXES IN 
SUPERMARKETS AS IN MALAYSIA\'S CONSERVATIVE 
KELANTAN STATE, NOR ARE WOMEN COVERED UP IN 
BILLBOARDS AND MOVIE ADS. MANY MUSLIM WOMEN 
PREFER NOT TO WEAR A HEADSCARF; THOSE WHO DO 
MAY LEAVE PART OF THE HAIR EXPOSED. IN THE 
ROYAL PHOTOS THAT ADORN MOST BUILDINGS, HM\'S 
WIVES SHOW OFF THEIR CASCADING TRESSES. 
 
29.  ALSO, UNLIKE KELANTAN, THERE IS NO PUSH 
TO INSTITUTE HUDUD (ISLAMIC PENAL LAW 
PERMITTING AMPUTATIONS AND STONING). STILL, 
THERE ARE PROACTIVE ISLAMIC MEASURES, NOTABLY 
A SCHEME TO CONVERT NATIVE PEOPLE. \"IF IBANS 
BECOME MUSLIMS WE PROVIDE A HOUSE FOR THEM,\" 
SAYS BRUNEI UNIVERSITY CHIEF ABU BAKAR APONG. 
WHILE SUCH PROGRAMS GO ON. AND CONSERVATIVES 
LIKE BADARUDDIN AND RAHMAN BRISTLE AT THE 
NOTION OF A MORE LIBERAL SOCIETY, THERE IS NO 
DOUBT BRUNEI CAN\'T KEEP A WIRED WORLD AT BAY. 
CONSIDER THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS A DEDICATED 
INTERNET LINE TO THE U.S. THAT IS NOT VETTED. 
 
30.  BRUNEI HAS A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE IT 
CAN COMPARE WITH OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN 
STATES. JAMALUDDIN HOPES \"TO LEARN FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES THAT GO TOO FAST.\" NO ONE WANTS TO 
DISTURB THE COZY AFFLUENCE. \"THIS IS THE BEST 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,\" SAYS A SMILING RAZALI. 
\"WE ARE ALL HAPPY.\" THAT MAY BE OFFICIAL 
HYPE, BUT MOST DO SEEM GENUINELY CONTENT. 
\"BRUNEI CAN DO ANYTHING IF IT WANTS.\" SAYS 
DAMIT CHUCHU, OF THE BANDAR-BASED EAST ASEAN 
BUSINESS COUNCIL. \"WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY. WE 
ONLY LACK EXPERTISE.\" 
 
31.  PERHAPS THAT IS ANOTHER REASON TO OPEN 
UP AND BRING IN TOURISTS AND EXPERTS. LET 
THEM SEE WHAT BRUNEI HAS TO OFFER AND DISPEL 
MISCONCEPTIONS. IN DOING SO, THERE MAY BE 
STARTLING CHANGES THAT WILL NEED ALL HM\'S 
ASTUTENESS TO IMPLEMENT WITHOUT LOSING 
CONTROL. BUT IF IT CAN BE DONE, BRUNEIANS AND 
VISITORS WILL REAP THE REWARDS. THE TOURISM 
CHIEF SEES EXAMPLES IN OTHER \"LIBERALIZING\" 
SLAMIC STATES IN THE PERSIAN GULF. \"PERHAPS 
WE SHOULD BE LIKE OMAN AND LEGALIZE SOME 
HOTELS TO SERVE DRINKS,\" SAYS JAMALUDDIN 
\"TOURISTS NEED NIGHTLIFE. CHAMPAGNE ON THE 
BALCONY, GAZING AT THE SUNSET.\" VIVA, BRUNEI! 
 
32.  CHARGE\'S COMMENT:  THE IRONY OF MITTEN\'S 
ARTICLE IS THAT IT HAS POSSIBLY ACCOMPLISHED 
TWO THINGS THAT IT DIDN\'T INTEND.  FIRST, IT 
HAS PROBABLY CAUSED THE SULTAN AND PRINCE 
JEFRI TO CLOSE RANKS.  THEY APPEAR CLOSER NOW 
THAN THEY WERE IN FEBRUARY WHEN JEFRI 
RESIGNED AS FINANCE MINISTER. SECONDLY, 
BECAUSE OF ITS SEEDY \"REVELATIONS\"  IT 
STRENGTHENS THE HAND OF THE RELIGIOUS 
CONSERVATIVES IN THE COUNTRY, WHO UNDER THE 
MANTLE OF ISLAMIZATION, OPPOSE POLITICAL AND 
SOCIAL REFORM,  BY BELITTLING THE EFFORTS 
BRUNEI IS MAKING TO MODERNIZE.

1.  AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MARCH 26, STATED THAT THE 
SULTAN\'S ELDEST SON, PRINCE AL-MUHTADEE 
BILLAH, WILL BE CROWNED \"PUTERA MAKHOTA\" OR 
CROWN PRINCE, AT A CEREMONY TO BE HELD IN 
AUGUST. 
 
2.  THE CEREMONY IS EXPECTED TO BE LARGE AND 
LAVISH, STEEPED IN TRADITION, WITH A 
PROCESSION THROUGH THE TOWN CENTER, AND 
GUESTS FROM ASEAN AND AROUND THE NORLD WILL 
BE INVITED TO ATTEND. 
 
3.  COMMENT.  WHILE THE CONFERRING OF THE 
TITLE \"PUTERA MAKHOTA\" ON PRINCE BILLAH BY 
SULTAN HASSNAL BOLKIAH CONFIRMS THAT BILLAR 
WILL SUCCEED HIM,  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
INDICATION THAT THE SULTAN INTENDS TO 
ABDICATE IN BILLAH\'S FAVOR, A PRECEDENT SET 
BY THE SULTAN\'S OWN FATHER, SULTAN OMAR ALI 
SAIFUDDIEN, WHO STEPPED DOWN IN 1967.  MOST 
BRUNELANS BELIEVE THAT THE SULTAN WILL 
CONTINUE TO REIGN FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, BUT 
THAT PRINCE BILLAH WILL BEGIN TO REPRESENT 
THE SULTAN AT SOME OF HIS MANY OFFICIAL 
ENGAGEMENTS WITHIN BRUNEI.  END COMMENT.

1.SUMMARY:  THE SULTAN\'S ELDEST SON, PRINCE BILLAH, WAS 
  MADE CROWN PRINCE IN A VERY TRADITIONAL CEREMONY ON 
  AUGUST 11.  THE WIDELY EXPECTED RETURN OF PRINCE JEFRI 
  DID NOT HAPPEN.  IN A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH REUTER\'S 
  JEFRI VOWED TO DEFEND HIS INTERESTS IF THEY ARE 
  THREATENED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.THE CEREMONY TO PROCLAIM YANG TERAMAT MULIA PADUKA 
  SERI DULI PENGIRAN MUDA HAJI AL-MUHTADEE BILLAH AS 
  CROWN PRINCE WAS ATTENDED BY THOUSANDS OF SENIOR 
  BRUNEIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORP.  INVITED 
  GUESTS INCLUDED THE SON OF KING HUSSAIN OF JORDAN. 
  AFTER THE CEREMONY AT WHICH THE SULTAN PRESENTED HIS 
  SON WITH A KERIS (MALAY DAGGER) TO MARK HIS 
  INAUGURATION, THE PRINCE WAS CONVEYED IN PROCESSION 
  THROUGH THE CAPITAL ON AN ELABORATE, GOLD PLATED 
  CARRIAGE.  THE PRINCE NOW CARRIES THE TITLE DULI YANG 
  TERAMAT MULIA PADUKA SERI PENGIRAN MUDA MAHKOTA HAJI 
  AL-MUHTADEE BILLAH.  IT IS EXPECTEO THAT IN THE NEAR 
  FUTURE THE CROWN PRINCE WILL BE APPOINTED TO AN 
  INFLUENTIAL GOVERNMENT POST. 
 
3.IT HAD BEEN WIDELY RUMORED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT 
  PRINCE JEFRI WOULD BEGIN TO MEND HIS RIFT WITH THE 
  SULTAN AND RETURN TO BRUNEI FOR THE CROWNING. 
  HOWEVER, SOURCES SAY THAT NEGOTIATIONS TO INVITE JEFRI 
  TO RETURN BROKE DOWN.  THE WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 12 BORNEO 
  BULLETIN PUBLISHED A REUTER\'S ARTICLE WHICH REPORTED A 
  STATEMENT FROM PRINCE JEFRI, GIVEN ON THE EVE OF THE 
  ROYAL INAUGURATION.  THE STATEMENT READ \"ON THE 
  OCCASION OF HIS INVESTITURE, I WISH TO OFFER CROWN 
  PRINCE BILLAH MY CONGRATULATIONS AND WARMEST GOOD 
  WISHES.  I REGRET THAT I AM UNABLE TO ATTEND THE 
  CEREMONY, BUT THE RECENT DISTURBING TURN OF EVENTS IN 
  BRUNEI HAS MADE THIS IMPOSSIBLE.\"  HE ALSO REPORTEDLY 
  SAID THAT FOR THE PRESENT HE PREFERRED TO BE LEFT 
  ALONE, BUT THAT HE WOULD DEFEND VIGOROUSLY HIS 
  POSITION AND THE INTERESTS OF HIS FAMILY IF FORCED TO 
  DO SO.  THE PRINCE IS REPORTEDLY IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
4.IN THE THURSDAY, AUGUST 13 BORNEO BULLETIN, MALAI 
  HASSAN CONTINUED HIS REPORTING ON THE PUBLIC SUPPORT 
  THE SULTAN IS RECEIVING FOR HIS STANCE ON THE 
  AMEDEO/PRINCE JEFRI AFFAIR.  UNNAMED BRUNEIAN 
  COMMUNITY LEADERS WERE QUOTED AS SAYING \"HIS MAJESTY 
  HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT NO ONE, NOT EVEN HIS 
  FAMILY MEMBERS, IS ABOVE THE LAW AND HE IS CLEARLY 
  COMMITTED TO HIS DIVINE DUTY TO LEAD AND GUIDE THE 
  COUNTRY ON THE NATION\'S WELL-TESTED MIB (MALAY ISLAMIC 
  MONARCHY) PHILOSOPHY.\"  MALAI HASSAN ALSO REITERATED 
  THE BRUNEI GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENTS, ISSUED BY ITS 
  INFORMATION DEPARTMENT, THAT BRUNEI IS NOT BEING 
  INFLUENCEO BY FOREIGN EXTREMISTS. 
 
5.COMMENT:  THE DEEP RIFT BETWEEN THE SULTAN AND PRINCE 
  JEFRI DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ON THE MEND. THERE IS 
  SPECULATION THAT THE SULTAN IS ABOUT TO APPROPRIATE 
  PRINCE JEFRI\'S OIL EXPLORATION JOINT VENTURE 
  COMPANIES, ONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN 
  PRODUCTION NEXT YEAR.  (NOTE:  UNOCAL\'S WORK IN BRUNEI 
  IS ASSOCIATED WITH JEFRI\'S OFFSHORE PROPERTIES.) 
  PRINCE JEFRI VOWS TO DEFEND HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS BUT 
  IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW HE WILL DO SO.

INFORMATION 
 
REF: A) STATE 117173;  B) BANDAR O030O 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES GEORGIA T. 
WRIGHT. REASONS 1.5 (C). 
 
2.  (C) THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION RESPONDS TO A 
DEPARTMENT REQUEST FOR BRIEFING MATERIAL IN 
PREPARATION FOR UPCOMING APEC MEETINGS (REFTEL A). 
 
3. (U) OBJECTIVES OF BRUNEI\'S LEADERS AND KEY 
FOCUS.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL B, BRUNEI WILL FOCUS 
ON SMALL AND MEDIUM ECONOMIES AND HUMAN RESOURCE 
DEVELOPMENT (HRD).  SPECIAL INTEREST WILL BE GIVEN 
TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SINCE 
BRUNEI IS DEVELOPING ITS CAPABLITY IN THE HOPE OF 
BECOMING A FINANCIAL SERVICE HUB. WITHIN THE 
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE STEERING COMMITTEE, BRUNEI 
WILL WISH TO BALANCE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION 
TECHNOLOGY WITH CAPACITY BUILDING. 
 
4.  (U) BRUNEI APEC PLANNERS BELIEVE HRD TO BE 
\"CRUCIAL\" TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ECONOMIES. AT THE 
JULY 7 BUDGET MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEETING IN 
SINGAPORE, BRUNEI PUSHED FORWARD THREE PROJECT- 
RELATED PROPOSALS: AN HRD TRAINER EDUCATION 
PROJECT TO BE CONDUCTED BY ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES 
\"LIKE THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA\"; AN APEC-FUNDED 
WORKSHOP ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; AND A PROJECT ON 
STANDARDS. THE DIRECTOR OF THE BRUNEI APEC 
SECRETARIAT HAS TOLD US THAT APEC 20OO WILL 
REVOLVE AROUND NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION 
TECHNOLOGIES. HE SAID OTHER POTENTIAL TOPICS FOR 
NEXT YEAR ARE NATURAL GAS INITIATIVES, DEVELOPING 
AIR SERVICE NETWORKS, AND TOURISM. 
 
5. (C) APEC OECISION-MAKING.  THE SULTAN IS NOT 
PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE APEC DECISION-MAKING 
PROCESS, BUT HE IS BRIEFED AND ADVISED OF ECONOMIC 
IMPLICATIONS.  THE MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND 
PRIMARY RESOURCES, PEHIN HAJI ABDUL RAHMAN, IS THE 
LEAD MINISTER FOR APEC ECONOMIC MATTERS.  HE IS 
ASSISTED BY HIS PERMANENT SECRETARY, DATO HAJI 
DANIAL, AND BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT, LIM 
JOCK HOI.  JOCK HOI IS THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF 
PEHIN LIM JOCK SENG, PERMANENT SECRETARY AT THE 
MFA, WHO IS ALSO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN APEC DECISION- 
MAKING. 
 
6.  (C) STATUS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SULTAN AND 
PRINCE JEFRI.  PRINCE JEFRI IS STILL OUT OF THE 
FOLD.  HE IS PRESENTLY IN EUROPE LIVING WITH A 
CONSIDERABLY SCALED DOWN ENTOURAGE. 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO BRUNEI\'S MISSING BILLIONS 
CONTINUE, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT JEFFRI WILL BE 
RESTORED TO THE SULTAN\'S FAVOR WHILE THE COUNTRY 
IS EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN.  WE UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THAT THE TWO 
ARE IN OCCASIONAL PHONE CONTACT AND THAT THEY 
PLAYED POLO TOGETHER IN THE UK LAST MONTH DURING 
ROYAL WEDDING FESTIVITIES. 
 
7.  (C) PRINCE JEFRI AND PEHIN AZIZ.  AS 
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, PEHIN HAJI ABDUL AZIZ IS A 
CONSERVATIVE, LIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF THE 
SULTAN\'S CABINET.  HE IS PRESENTLY THE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION AND ACTING MINISTER OF HEALTH.  AFTER 
THE AMEDEO COLLAPSE HE WAS APPOINTED BY THE SULTAN 
TO HEAD THE BRUNEI INVESTMENT AGENCY (BIA), 
FORMERLY CONTROLLED BY PRINCE JEFRI.  THE MANUKIAN 
BROTHERS AND MISS AMERICA COURT CASES, WHICH 
REVEALED LURID DETAILS ABOUT PRINCE JEFRI\'S 
PRIVATE LIFE, PROMPTED PEHIN AZIZ TO CONVINCE THE 
SULTAN OF THE DAMAGE JEFRI\'S NOTORIETY WAS DOING 
TO BRUNEI\'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND TO THE 
SULTAN\'S OWN CREDIBILITY AS A PIOUS RULER.  AZIZ 
IS ALSO BELIEVED TO HAVE ALERTED THE SULTAN TO THE 
IMMENSITY OF PRINCE JEFRI\'S MISAPPROPRIATIONS FROM 
THE BRUNEI TREASURY.  WITHOUT QUESTION, THERE IS 
ANIMOSITY BETWEEN PRINCE JEFRI AND PEHIN AZIZ, BUT 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AZIZ AND PRINCE MOHAMED 
IS RELATED TO AZIZ\' INFLUENCE ON THE ROYAL FAMILY. 
THE TWO MEN ARE COMPATIBLE BUT NOT COHORTS. 
(ALTHOUGH RELIGIOUS, PRINCE MOHAMED IS NOT AS 
CONSERVATIVE AS AZIZ, NOR IS HIS POLITICAL OUTLOOK 
AS RESTRICTIVE.) 
 
8. (C) STRENGTH OF RADICAL ISLAMISTS.   IN BRUNEI, 
THE OFFICIAL FAITH IS THE SHAFEITE SCHOOL OF 
ISLAM.  NO FORM OF RADICAL ISLAM IS PERMITTED. 
HOWEVER, THE MORE CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC MEMBERS OF 
THE CABINET, PARTICULARLY PEHIN AZIZ AND THE 
PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
OFFICE, HAJI HAZAIR, APPEAR TO BE ESPECIALLY 
INFLUENTIAL.  HAJI HAZAIR IS A PROT\'EG\'E OF PEHIN 
ISA, THE SULTAN\'S CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER CUM 
MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS.  WHILE THE CONSERVATIVES 
ARE CURENTLY ENJOYING A REVIVAL, THE PROGRESSIVES 
ARE WAITING FOR THE DUST TO SETTLE AFTER THE 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO AMEDEO ARE COMPLETE.  THEY 
BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE TRUE EXTENT OF BRUNEI\'S 
LOSSES IS KNOWN, EVERYONE WILL NEED TO BE INVOLVED 
TO REALISTICALLY HANDLE THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS. 
 
9.  (U) THE BRUNEI CONSTITUTION.  DURING THE VISIT 
OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II IN MARCH 1998, FOREIGN 
MINISTER PRINCE MOHAMED PUBLICALLY STATED THAT A 
REVISED CONSTITUTION SOON WOULD BE UNVEILED. IT 
WAS NOT.  THE MEDIA ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 1999 THE 
APPOINTMENT OF A SUBCOMMITTEE TO REMOVE SOME OF 
THE ANTIQUATED BRITISH LAWS FROM THE CONSTITUTION 
AND REALIGN SOME (UNSPECIFIED) LAWS WITH ISLAMIC 
LAW.  NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN HEARD ABOUT THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW PROCESS. 
 
10. (C) CROWN PRINCE BILLAH\'S RELATONSHIPS WITH 
BROTHERS/UNCLES, ETC.   CROWN PRINCE BILLAH 
APPEARS TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH HIS UNCLES, 
ESPECIALLY PRINCE MOHAMED, THE FOREIGN MINISTER. 
HE ALSO APPEARS REGULARLY IN PUBLIC WITH HIS HALF- 
BROTHER, PRINCE AZIM, THE ELDEST SON OF THE 
SULTAN\'S SECOND WIFE, AND WITH PRINCE QAWI, AND 
PRINCE MOHAMED\'S ELDEST SON.  HE DOES NOT, 
HOWEVER, APPEAR TO HAVE VERY CLOSE RELATIONS WITH 
PRINCE HAKIM, THE SON OF PRINCE JEFFRI.  THE 
SULTAN\'S FAMILIES, BY HIS FIRST AND SECOND WIVES, 
SEEM TO BE WELL INTEGRATED.  FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS 
DISPLAYED IN THE PALACES OF THE WIVES INCLUDE 
MEMBERS OF BOTH FAMILIES ENJOYING SOCIAL EVENTS 
TOGETHER.

CLINTON CONCERNING APEC 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS AN ADVANCE COPY OF SULTAN 
HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH\'S LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT 
REGARDING THE AGENDA FOR THE NOVEMBER 15-16 APEC 
LEADERS MEETING IN BRUNEI. WE EXPECT THAT BRUNEI 
EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON WILL DELIVER THE ORIGINAL. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT OF SULTAN\'S LETTER. 
 
YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
 
I AM VERY PLEASED THAT YOU WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN 
THE INFORMAL APEC ECONOMIC LEADERS\' MEETING IN 
BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN ON 15-16 NOVEMBER. 
 
WE WILL GATHER AGAIN THIS YEAR HAVING FURTHER 
CONSOLIDATED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HAVING 
CONTINUED THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL REFORM 
SO IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF ALL ECONOMIES IN 
THE REGION.  OUR FINANCE MINISTERS, AT THEIR MEETING 
IN BRUNEI DARUSSALAM IN SEPTEMBER, HAVE CAUTIONED 
AGAINST COMPLACENCY IN THESE EFFORTS AND HAVE DRAWN 
ATTENTION TO THE KEY ISSUES NEEDED TO SECURE 
FINANCIAL STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, 
AND TO THE POTENTIAL RISKS AHEAD. 
 
THESE ISSUES ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE 
PROCESS OF MANAGING GLOBALISATION WHICH I BELIEVE IS 
THE MAJOR CHALLENGE BEFORE US AT THIS TIME.  I AM 
THEREFORE SUGGESTING THAT THIS BE THE SUBJECT OF OUR 
RETREAT ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.  I WOULD BE 
MOST GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD BE ONE OF THE LEAD 
SPEAKERS ON THIS TOPIC.  I KNOW THAT SOME LEADERS 
MAY ALSO WANT TO RAISE THEIR CONCERNS OVER 
INSTABILITY IN THE PRICE OF OIL AND I PROPOSE THAT 
THIS BE DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MORNING RETREAT. 
I OUTLINED SOME OF THE ISSUES WHICH I THOUGHT WERE 
IMPORTANT FOR OUR DISCUSSION ON GLOBALIZATION AND 
ITS STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN MY EARLIER LETTER TO YOU 
AND I AM ENCOURAGED BY POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM 
LEADERS.  OUR OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO BEEN PREPARING 
BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR US FOR THIS DISCUSSION WHICH 
SHOWS SOME OF APEC\'S KEY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
SUCCESSES IN GLOBALIZATION AND SOME OF THE ISSUES 
FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
WHILE THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF MANY 
FORUMS THIS YEAR, I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE APEC BRINGS 
TOGETHER A DIVERSE RANGE OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING 
ECONOMIES, WE ARE IN A POSITION TO SHOW LEADERSHIP 
AND MAKE A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION.  WE SHOULD BE 
STRIVING TO SHOW OUR COMMUNITIES THAT APEC\'S 
BALANCED AGENDA OF MARKET OPENING AND CAPACITY 
BUILDING CAN MAKE GLOBALISATION AND THE REVOLUTION 
IN TECHNOLOGY AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS WHICH, WHEN 
EFFECTIVELY MANAGED, WILL PROVIDE GROWTH AND HIGHER 
LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL SECTIONS OF OUR ECONOMIES. 
WE SHOULD BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BUT IT 
IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE WITH A 
CREDIBLE COURSE OF ACTION. 
 
IN THIS RESPECT, I AM PLEASED TO LEARN FROM MY 
OFFICIALS THAT MANY ECONOMIES HAVE OFFERED TO 
INITIATE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN THE 
CAPACITY OF OUR ECONOMIES TO TAKE UP THE ADVANTAGES 
OF GLOBALIZATION.  THESE PROGRAMS, DESIGNED TO 
STRENGTHEN OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE, OUR MARKETS AND OUR 
HUMAN RESOURCES, GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE 
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AS THE 
CONDUIT TO THE SO-CALLED NEW ECONOMY.  TOGETHER THEY 
PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR TAKING CAPACITY BUILDING AND 
COMMERCE TO THE WIDEST SPECTRUM OF OUR ECONOMIES, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES WHO ARE YET 
TO SEE THE FULL BENEFITS. 
 
FOLLOWING THE MORNING SESSION AND AN INFORMAL 
LUNCHEON WHERE COLLEAGUES WILL BE FREE TO DISCUSS 
ISSUES AMONG THEMSELVES, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE 
CONTINUE OUR RETREAT FOCUSING ON THE WTO AND 
DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
AS A REGION, OUR STAKE IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADING 
SYSTEM HAS PERHAPS NEVER BEEN GREATER.  I AM SURE 
THEREFORE THAT WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK 
OF PROGRESS IN THE WTO AND WILL WANT TO STRESS IN 
CLEAR TERMS THE IMPORTANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHING 
OF A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. 
OUR DISCUSSIONS WILL ENABLE US TO SHARE VIEWS ON 
WAYS IN WHICH APEC CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PROGRESS AND 
HOW WE CAN COOPERATE IN CAPACITY BUILDING TO ENSURE 
THAT WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE AND 
DETERMINATION. 
 
THE AFTERNOON RETREAT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN IDEAL 
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXCHANGE VIEWS INFORMALLY ON 
THE NATURE AND RATIONALE OF EMERGING REGIONAL 
TRADING ARRANGEMENTS.  I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS 
DISCUSSION TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING SO THAT WE CAN 
DEVELOP A CLEARER PICTURE OF HOW SUCH ARRANGEMENTS 
WILL HELP ADVANCE OUR COMMON GOALS. 
 
I KNOW THAT ABAC HAS BEEN DISCUSSING BOTH 
GLOBALISATION AND TRADE ISSUES THIS YEAR AND I 
EXPECT THAT OUR DIALOGUE WITH ABAC MEMBERS ON THE 
AFTERNOON OF 15 NOVEMBER WILL ENRICH OUR RETREAT 
DISCUSSIONS.  SEVERAL LEADERS WILL ALSO BE 
INTERACTING WITH BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES AT THE CEO 
SUMMIT ON 14-15 NOVEMBER. 
 
FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE 
ART EXHIBITION BY YOUNG ARTISTS FROM OUR APEC 
ECONOMIES.  YOUR VIEWING OF THE EXHIBITION AND 
INTERACTION WITH THE ARTISTS AFTER THE CLOSE OF OUR 
MEETINGS ON 15 NOVEMBER WILL SEND AN ENCOURAGING 
SIGNAL TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE VALUE WE PLACE 
ON MAINTAINING CULTURAL IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION IN 
THE PROCESS OF COMMUNITY BUILDING. 
 
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED MANY OF THE 
CHALLENGES AHEAD AND HAVE BEGUN OUR PREPARATIONS. 
GIVEN THE TASK AHEAD AND WIDESPREAD CONCERN ABOUT 
THE FUTURE, I BELIEVE THAT THE LEADERS\' DECLARATION 
SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR AND DECISIVE VISION OF THE 
FUTURE AND ONE WHICH WILL GIVE GREATER CONFIDENCE TO 
ALL PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. 
 
I LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO WELCOMING YOU IN BRUNEI 
DARUSSALAM NEXT MONTH. 
 
YOURS SINCERELY,

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, BX 
SUBJECT: TO WED OR NOT TO WED: THAT IS THE ROYAL QUESTION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR GENE B. CHRISTY.  REASONS: 1.5 B & D. 
 
 1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE CROWN PRINCE, AL-MUHATADEE BILLAH, IS 
EXPECTED TO WED IN AUGUST.  THE ONLY UNANSWERED QUESTION IS 
WHO WILL BE HIS BRIDE.  THE WEDDING IS IMPORTANT.  IT WILL 
ALLOW THE CROWN PRINCE TO START A FAMILY -- AND, WITH LUCK, 
PRODUCE A MALE HEIR.  IT WILL ALSO SET THE STAGE FOR A 
TRANSFER OF POWER FROM THE CURRENT SULTAN, ALTHOUGH SUCH A 
CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP IS LIKELY AT LEAST A DECADE AWAY.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) COMMITTES HAVE BEEN FORMED.  THE CROWN PRINCE HAS BEEN 
ELEVATED TO FOUR-STAR GENERAL OF THE ARMY.  HE MAKES ALMOST 
DAILY VISITS TO SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, AND MILITARY 
INSTALLATIONS, AND LOCAL MEDIA COVER THESE EVENTS SLAVISHLY. 
TOP POSITIONS IN THE NATIONAL SOCIAL HIERARCHY HAVE BEEN 
FILLED.  ALL THIS ACTIVITY POINTS IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION.  THE 
CROWN PRINCE, NOW AGED 32, IS FINALLY GOING TO MARRY.  EVEN 
THE DATE IS PRETTY WELL KNOWN: THE WEEK OF AUGUST 10.  THE 
ONLY QUESTION: WHO\'S GOING TO BE THE BRIDE? 
 
3. (C) IN 2003, THERE WERE ACTIVE RUMORS THAT THE CROWN 
PRINCE WOULD WED IN EARLY DECEMBER.  THE BRIDE WAS EXPECTED 
TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF A NON-ROYAL BRUNEI WOMAN AND AN IRISH 
FATHER.  SHE HAD MET THE CROWN PRINCE WHEN THEY WERE STUDYING 
IN THE UK.  NOTHING CAME OF THAT RUMOR REPORTEDLY BECAUSE 
BOTH THE SULTAN AND THE RAJA ISTERI (QUEEN) OBJECTED TO THE 
MARRIAGE.  SOME RUMORMONGERS SAID IT WAS BECAUSE THE YOUNG 
WOMAN WAS A MIXED-HERITAGE COMMONER.  OTHERS WHISPERED THAT 
SHE HAD A CHECKERED PAST, INCLUDING INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH 
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY. 
 
4.  (C) MORE RECENTLY, THE RUMORS OF A ROYAL WEDDING IN 2004 
HAVE BECOME MORE CONCRETE.  EARLY RUMORS CLAIMED THAT THE 
CROWN PRINCE HAD, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY, STOOD UP TO HIS 
PARENTS AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD MARRY THE COMMONER.  NOW, 
HOWEVER, THE STORY MAKING THE ROUNDS OF THE CAPITAL IS THAT 
THE SULTAN AND RAJA ISTERI HAVE FOUND A MORE SUITABLE 
CANDIDATE AND THAT THE CROWN PRINCE HAS ACQUIESCED.  THE 
REPORTED CANDIDATE BRIDE IS THE 18-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF A 
PENGIRAN (ROYAL FAMILY RELATIVE) EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC WORKS 
DEPARTMENT AND A SWEDISH MOTHER.  NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS 
HAVE BEEN MADE, NOR IS IT CLEAR WHEN THE MARRIAGE WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED.  (NOTE: THE CURRENT SULTAN\'S WEDDING, AT AGE 19, 
WAS ANNOUNCED ONE WEEK BEFORE.  END NOTE) 
 
5. (C) THE CROWN PRINCE\'S IMPENDING WEDDING HAS FUELED RUMORS 
THAT THE SULTAN WILL DO WHAT HIS OWN FATHER DID AND RETIRE AS 
SULTAN A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THE WEDDING.  A SENIOR MITSUBISHI 
OFFICIAL FROM JAPAN RAISED THAT SCENARIO UNDIPLOMATICALLY 
WITH MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS PEHIN ISA LAST WEEK.  ACCORDING 
TO THE LOCAL MITSUBISHI REPRESENTATIVE (PROTECT), PEHIN ISA 
TOOK THE QUESTION IN STRIDE.  PEHIN ISA RESPONDED THAT THE 
CURRENT SULTAN IS IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND CONTINUES TO ENJOY 
HIS ROLE AS SULTAN.  HE DISCOURAGED SPECULATION THAT THE 
MARRIAGE MIGHT PORTEND A CHANGE IN NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT:  THE CROWN PRINCE\'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD 
(DIABETES AND OTHER PROBLEMS), AND THE ROYAL FAMILY HAS FOR 
SOME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM TO MARRY.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT 
HIS SOCIAL LIFE HAS BEEN SO CLOSELY WATCHED AND RESTRICTED 
THAT HE HAS NOT HAD MUCH CHANCE TO MEET ANYONE.  AND NONE OF 
THE COUSINS INTRODUCED TO HIM HAVE WON FAVOR.  THE SULTAN AND 
RAJA ISTERI ARE REPORTEDLY ANXIOUS THAT THE CROWN PRINCE 
PRODUCE A MALE HEIR.  THEY ALSO HAVE REPORTEDLY ENCOURAGED 
HIM TO LOOK FOR A WIFE MORE GENETICALLY REMOVED THAN THEIR 
OWN GENERATION, AFTER MANY ROYAL CHILDREN, INCLUDING THE 
CROWN PRINCE, HAVE SHOWN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HANDICAPS THAT 
ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INTERMARRIAGE OF BRUNEIAN ROYALS.  THAT 
MAKES THE HALF BRUNEIAN-HALF SWEDISH, BUT ROYAL BLOODED, 
CANDIDATE BRIDE A GOOD MATCH.  MOREOVER, A ROYAL MARRIAGE 
WILL HASTEN THE DAY THE CURRENT SULTAN CAN CONSIDER DOING 
WHAT HIS OWN FATHER DID: RETIRING AND SERVING AS A MEMBER OF 
A DE FACTO REGENCY WHILE CROWN PRINCE BILLAH GETS INTO HIS 
OWN RULING STRIDE.  GIVEN THE SULTAN\'S GOOD HEALTH AND 
APPARENT ENJOYMENT OF HIS CURRENT POSITION, HOWEVER, SUCH A 
DEVELOPMENT APPEARS AT LEAST A DECADE AWAY. 
 
7.  (U) KABUL MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

1. SUMMARY: THE BRUNEI INFORMATION DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED 
MAY 15 THAT THE CROWN PRINCE, HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE 
HAJI AL-MUHTADEE BILLAH, 30, IS TO MARRY ON SEPTEMBER 8. 
HIS BRIDE-TO-BE IS AN UNKNOWN SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD 
STUDENT, DAYANGKU SARAH BTE PENGIRAN HAJI SALLEH ABDUL 
RAHAMAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  THE LONG-EXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON NATIONAL 
TELEVISION ON SATURDAY, MAY 15, AND COPIES OF THE BORNEO 
BULLETIN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, WHICH CARRIED AN OFFICIAL 
PORTRAIT OF SARAH, WERE SOLD OUT WITHIN HOURS.  MESSAGES 
CONGRATULATING THE COUPLE AND THE PRINCE\'S WISE CHOICE 
OF A BRIDE HAVE BEEN POURING IN TO BRUNEI\'S INTERNET 
BOARDS. THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD PRAISE ALSO THAT THE 
PRINCE HAS CHOSEN AGAINST MARRYING HIS EARLIER RUMORED

TO WITHSTAND PUBLIC SCRUTINY. 
 
3.  DAYANGKU SARAH IS A STUDENT AT THE PADUKA SERI

UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS.  SHE IS THE YOUNGEST 
OF THREE CHILDREN.  HER FATHER IS A MINOR RANKING 
\"PENGIRAN,\" WHICH MEANS HE HAS SOME ROYAL BLOOD, BUT THE

REFTEL.) 
 
4.  THE EMERGENCE OF DAYANGKU SARAH IS A RECENT 
DEVELOPMENT.  AS PART OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S ANTICIPATED WEDDING, HE HAS IN THE PAST SEVERAL 
MONTHS INCREASED HIS APPEARANCES AT PUBLIC EVENTS AND 
MADE REGULAR VISITS TO PROMINENT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 
AMONG THE SCHOOLS HE VISITED WAS THE PADUKA SERI BEGAWAN 
SULTAN SCIENCE COLLEGE, WHERE HE MET SARAH FOR THE FIRST 
TIME.  UPON REPORTING HIS INTEREST, THE PALACE SWUNG 
INTO ACTION AND DETERMINED THAT SARAH HAD MANY OF THE 
QUALITIES THE SULTAN AND QUEEN HOPED FOR IN A BRIDE, 
INCLUDING A ROYAL FAMILY CONNECTION AND NEW BLOOD FOR 
THE ROYAL LINE.  CROWN PRINCE BILLAH, ACCORDING TO THE 
LOCAL RUMOR MILL, IS HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH SARAH 
AND HAS COMPLETELY LOST INTEREST IN HIS FORMER LEADING 
BRIDE CHOICE -- OR AT LEAST THAT\'S THE SPIN BEING 
CIRCULATED FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. 
 
5.  COMMENT:    THE EMBASSY IS WORKING WITH MFA PROTOCOL 
TO DETERMINE WHETHER FOREIGN REPS WILL BE INVITED AND 
WILL REPORT WHEN CONFIRMATION IS AVAILABLE.  AMBASSADOR 
HAS BEEN TOLD INFORMALLY THAT UP TO 100 HEADS OF 
STATE/ROYALS WILL BE INVITED TO THE CEREMONY.  THE 
OFFICIAL WEDDING PERIOD IS SLATED TO RUN FROM AUGUST 26 
TO SEPTEMBER 8.  KEY EVENTS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AND 
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SEPTEMBER 8. 
 
6. KABUL MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
