1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
- 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE ONLY POPULAR MOVEMENT EVER TO HAVE 
MOUNTED A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO ASAD\'S REGIME--THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD--HAS NOT RECOVERED FROM ITS INTERNAL 
DIVISIONS AND THE DEVASTATING BLOW SUFFERED AT HAMA. 
THE JANUARY 25 \"PARDON\" ANNOUNCED FOR CERTAIN MUSLIM 
BROTHER EXILES IS FAR LESS THAN A GENERAL AMNESTY; 
PROBABLY FEW MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATING 
IT AND FEW WILL BENEFIT FROM IT.  THE \"PARDON\" WAS USE- 
FUL TO ASAD IN BOLSTERING HIS IMAGE OF \"BENEVOLENCE\" 
IN THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE FEBRUARY 10 REFERENDUM. 
IT TESTIFIES TO THE CONTINUED WEAK STATE OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS:  DEFEATED, DIVIDED, & DISCREDITED 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.  SINCE THE MASSIVE ARRESTS THAT BEGAN IN DECEMBER 
1981 AND THE DEMOLITION OF HAMA IN FEBRUARY 1982, THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAS BEEN TAME.  IN THE INTERIM, 
ASAD\'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS HAVE DERIVED FROM AN ENTIRELY 
DIFFERENT AREA--HIS OWN LAPSE OF HEALTH AND HIS BROTHER 
RIF\'AT\'S GRAB FOR POWER.  HAMA IS USUALLY VIEWED AS THE 
WHOLE EXPLANATION FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' FALL, BUT 
THE EXPLANATION IS MORE COMPLEX. 
 
- 
4.  LONG BEFORE HAMA, IN THE SEVENTIES, THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPLIT INTO AT LEAST THREE \"TENDENCIES.\" 
THERE WAS, AND STILL IS, A GROUP CENTERED AT AACHEN IN 
WEST GERMANY, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR, 
WHO WAS EXILED FROM SYRIA IN 1964.  AS EARLY AS 1970 
MUSLIM BROTHERS IN SYRIA DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED A 
LEADER CLOSER TO HOME, AND \'ATTAR HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY 
IRRELEVANT.  AT PRESENT, ACCORDING TO OUR GERMAN 
COLLEAGUES, \'ATTAR IS OLD AND AILING, HE IS STILL IN 
AACHEN, AND HE HAS BECOME ONLY A RELIGIOUS \"THINKER.\" 
HE SEEMS NO LONGER TO HAVE MUCH OF A FOLLOWING. 
- 
 
5.  LEADERSHIP OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS CAME TO BE 
DIVIDED INTO POLITICAL AND MILITARY \"TENDENCIES.\"  THE 
POLITICAL TENDENCY WAS, AND STILL IS, LED BY A GROUP 
OF OLDER MEN (BORN IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES) 
SUCH AS \'ADNAN SA\'D AL-DIN, SA\'ID HAWWA, AND THE AL- 
BAYANUNI BROTHERS.  THESE MEN MAY BE IN BAGHDAD OR 
THEY MAY MOVE BETWEEN BAGHDAD AND AMMAN.  THE \"POLITICAL\" 
GROUP FALLS INTO THE TRADITIONAL MOLD OF THE FOUNDER 
OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, THE EGYPTIAN HASAN AL-BANNA: 
MEN WHO ARE \"FUNDAMENTALIST\" IN WISHING TO CREATE A 
STATE BUILT ON THE KORAN BUT WHO CAN ACCEPT CERTAIN 
WESTERN HUMANISTIC AND PARLIAMENTARY IDEAS.  IN THE 
EARLY SEVENTIES, THESE MEN EMBRACED THE IDEA OF MILITARY 
OPERATIONS (\"JIHAD\"), IN OPPOSITION TO THE LESS 
MILITARISTIC ORIENTATION OF \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR, BUT THEY 
WERE SUBSEQENTLY UPSTAGED BY THE FAR MORE ACTIVE 
MILITARISM OF THE \"MILITARY TENDENCY\" THAT DEVELOPED IN 
THE MID-SEVENTIES.  (IRONICALLY, \'ATTAR IS TODAY MORE 
IDEOLOGICALLY ALLIED WITH THE MILITARY TENDENCY THAN 
THE POLITICAL TENDENCY.) 
 
6.  THE \"MILITARY TENDENCY\" FROM THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN 
LED BY A MUCH YOUNGER GROUP OF MEN.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION 
IN THE MID-SEVENTIES, IT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS AL-TALI\'A 
AL-MUQATILA LIL-MUJAHIDIN (THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF 
WARRIORS).  IT HAS BEEN WILLING TO RESORT TO ANY FORM 
OF TERROR (E.G., BLOWING UP THE CADETS\' ARTILLERY 
SCHOOL IN ALEPPO IN 1980, WITH OVER FIFTY KILLED).  ITS 
LEADERS HAVE REJECTED WESTERN IDEAS, ANY FORM OF 
COMPROMISE WITH SECULAR MOVEMENTS, AND ANY MERCY FOR 
ALAWIS.  IN THEIR FANATICISM, THEY FORM A SUNNI ANALOGUE 
TO THE KHOMEINISTS.  THIS GROUP\'S EARLY LEADERS WERE ONE 
BY ONE KILLED BY ASAD\'S SECURITY FORCES WHEN 
ASAD BEGAN TO STEP UP HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERS IN 1979-80.  THE LEADER--OR \"CALIPH,\" AS HE 
WAS CALLED BY HIS ADHERENTS--WHO SUCCEEDED THEM WAS 
\'ADNAN \'UQLA (BORN 1950). 
 
7.  FOR A TIME, BEGINNING WITH THE FORMATION OF AN 
\"ISLAMIC FRONT\" AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE \"MANIFESTO 
OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OF SYRIA\" IN NOVEMBER 1980 
(SIGNED BY \'ADNAN SA\'D AL-DIN, SA\'ID HAWWA, AND \'ALI AL- 
BAYANUNI--THE LAST NAMED AS THE ISLAMIC FRONT\'S 
\"SECRETARY GENERAL\"), THERI WAS GREATER COOPERATION 
WITHIN THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR 
JOINED THE FRONT, AND \'UQLA AND THE \"POLITICAL TENDENCY\" 
HELD NEGOTIATIONS TO TRY TO PATCH UP THIIR DIFFERENCES. 
IT APPEARS THAT THEY MAY EVEN HAVE COORDINATED TO TRY 
TO EFFECT A COUP AGAINST ASAD, WHICH THEY FORESAW 
WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY MASS UPRISINGS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY.  (THEY ALSO HOPED FOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE-- 
FROM IRAQ, IN PARTICULAR.)  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS 
APPARENTLY HAD SYMPATHIZERS IN MANY QUARTERS OF THE 
REGIME, INCLUDING IN HIGH PLACES IN THE ARMED FORCES. 
PRESS REPORTING OF THE PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT COORDINATION 
AND PLANNING WERE, HOWEVER, LACKING.  ASAD\'S SECURITY 
FORCES GOT WIND OF THE PLOTTING AND BEGAN A MAJOR 
ARREST CAMPAIGN BY THE END OF 1981.  FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS 
WERE REPORTEDLY ARRESTED IN JANUARY, 1982.  BY THE TIME 
ASAD\'S MEN LOCATED THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' HEADQUARTERS IN 
HAMA, ON FEBRUARY 2, 1.82, ASAD\'S MEN HAD PROBABLY 
ALREADY BROKEN THE BACK OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' 
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE REGIME.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS 
IN HAMA, FORCED TO MAKE A STAND OR FACE ARREST AND 
EXECUTION, OVERWHELMED THE ARMED FORCE THAT ASAD 
ORGINALLY SENT IN TO HAMA, AND A SIEGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS 
ENSUED, RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.  ( A TALI\'A 
SOURCE IN SEPTEMBER 1982 CLAIMED THAT 6,000 OF ASAD\'S 
FORCES, 400 \"MUJAHIDIN,\" AND 15,000 CIVILIANS WERE 
KILLED.  MORE RECENTLY, SYRIANS ARE WONT TO CITE VERY 
MUCH HIGHER FIGURES.) 
 
8.  TALI\'A AND THE \"POLITICAL TENDENCY\" HAD ALREADY 
BROKEN OFF THEIR NEGOTIATIONS IN DECEMBER 1981, AT 
THE TIME WHEN THE MAJOR ARRESTS HAD BEGUN, TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAMA.  HAMA ITSELF, THEREFORE, WAS NOT THE CAUSE 
OF THE FINAL RUPTURE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STRONG FEELING 
AMONG THE \"POLITICAL TENDENCY\" THAT THE TALI\'A BOTCHED 
THE JOB IN HAMA.  THE RUPTURE BECAME OFFICIAL WHEN THE 
\"POLITICAL TENDENCY\" JOINED THE NEWLY CONSTITUTED 
\"NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR THE LIBERATION OF SYRIA\" IN 
MARCH 1982, WITH NINETEEN OTHER OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS 
OR INDIVIDUALS,MOST OF THEM SECULAR AND CENTERED IN 
IRAQ.  SA\'D AL-DIN REPRESENTS THE ISLAMIC FRONT IN THE 
NATIONAL ALLIANCE, WHICH INCLUDES THE PRO-IRAQI WING 
OF THE SYRIAN BA\'TH PARTY (MICHEL \'AFLAQ), THE ARAB 
SOCIALIST MOVEMENT (LED BY \'AFLAQ\'S ERSTWHILE ALLY 
AKRAM AL-HAWRANI), NASSERISTS, AND INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS 
FORMER SYRIAN DICTATOR AMIN AL-HAFIZ. 
 
9.  THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE SIGNALED 
HOW FAR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAD FALLEN.  NOT ONLY HAD 
IT LOST MUCH OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE PLANTED IN THE REGIME 
AND MUCH OF ITS FIGHTING FORCE, IT HAD BECOME 
IRRECONCILABLY SPLIT AND THE POLITICAL WING HAD SULLIED 
ITSELF BY ASSOCIATING WITH GROUPS ALIEN TO THE IDEA OF AN 
ISLAMIC STATE AND BY PUTTING ITSELF SQUARELY INTO THE 
GRIP OF THE IRAQI REGIME.  IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT IN 
THE PERIOD AFTER THOSE DEVASTATING MONTHS, DECEMBER 1981 
TO MARCH 1982, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OR NO  TERRORIST 
ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN 
SYRIA, AND INDEED, LITTLE APPARENT POLITICAL ACTIVITY. 
(THE ISRAELI INVASION OF LEBANON IN JUNE 1982 WAS 
ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, SINCE THAT INVASION HAD 
THE EFFECT OF BINDING THE SYRIAN POPULACE AGAINST THE 
PERCEIVED ENEMY, AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY--EVEN 
LEAVING ASIDE THE DISCREDITING TRAUMA OF HAMA--WOULD 
HAVE FOUND LESS POPULAR SYMPATHY THAN NORMALLY.) 
 
10.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
HAS EVER RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  WITH 
ITS INTERNAL STRUCTURE DISRUPTED AND ITS NAME BLACKENED 
AMONG ITS OWN PURISTS AND AMONG THE SYRIAN POPULACE AT 
LARGE, IT PRESUMABLY HAS HAD TO LOOK EVEN MORE ACTIVELY 
FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL 
CONSTRAINTS THAT CAUSE US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NOT 
HAD GREAT SUCCESS: 
 
--SECULAR, BA\'THI IRAQ WELCOMED AT LEAST SOME OF THE 
LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL   TENDENCY \"WITH OPEN ARMS.\" 
BUT IT CLOSED THE DOOR TO THE TALI\'A.  (\'UQLA COULD NOT 
FIND REFUGE THERE.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS HE WAS 
ARRESTED WHEN TRYING TO SNEAK BACK INTO SYRIA EITHER 
IN 1983 OR 1984; HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM RECENTLY.) 
A JORDANIAN COLLEAGUE SAYS THAT IRAQ \"MAY BE\" TRAINING 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERS NOW, BUT ON A LIMITED BASIS.  THE 
IRAQI REGIME APPARENTLY WILL NOT COUNTENANCE 
ANY OPERATIONS NOT TOTALLY UNDER ITS CONTROL. 
 
--JORDAN MAINTAINS AN INTELLIGENCE LINK TO THE BROTHER- 
HOOD AND REPORTEDLY ALLOWS ALL FACTIONS OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, BUT IT WOULD BE 
EXTREMELY NERVOUS ABOUT ANY OPERATION AGAINST SYRIA, 
WHICH WAS SEEN TO BE PLANNED OR TAKE PLACE FROM JORDAN. 
IT APPARENTLY GIVES LITTLE ACTIVE ASSISTANCE, AND IT IS 
SUSPICIOUS OF ALL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY. 
 
--ARAFAT\'S PLO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF COOPERATION WITH 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERS (ONE OF MANY REASONS FOR ASAD\'S 
ANTIPATHY), BUT ARAFAT\'S ABILITY TO BE HELPFUL IS PROBABLY 
NOT VERY GREAT.  ARAFAT AND OTHER FOUNDERS OF FATAH WERE 
THEMSELVES MUSLIM BROTHERS , AND FEDAYEEN AND MUSLIM 
BROTHERS TRAINED TOGETHER IN JORDAN BEFORE THE 1970 
CIVIL WAR.  MORE RECENTLY, ARAFAT AND SHAYKH SHA\'BAN, 
TAWHID LEADER IN TRIPOLI, LEBANON, WERE CLOSE ALLIES 
UNTIL ARAFAT WAS DRIVEN OUT IN DECEMBER 1983.  (SHA\'BAN, 
WE BELIEVE, IS A MUSLIM BROTHER, AND SOME OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO FLED AFTER HAMA TOOK REFUGE IN 
TRIPOLI AND FORM A PART OF THE TAWHID.)  ARAFAT\'S DIRECT 
ASSISTANCE--AT LEAST IN THE FORM OF ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING--WAS PROBABLY DISRUPTED 
BY HIS OUSTER FROM TRIPOLI AND WE ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO 
THE DEGREE OF CONTINUING COOPERATION. 
 
--IRAN IS ANATHEMA TO THE POLITICAL TENDECY, BOTH 
BECAUSE OF ITS SUPPORT FOR THE ASAD/ALAWI REGIME 
AND BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL TENDENCY\'S ASSOCIATION 
WITH IRAQ.  IRAN\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TALI\'A IS MORE 
NUANCED.  TALI\'A REVILES IRAN FOR ITS SUPPORT FOR ASAD, 
BUT THERE IS A COMMON FANATICISM AND THERE MAY BE A 
REALIZATION WITH THE TALI\'A THAT IRAN\'S RELATIONSHIP 
WITH ASAD IS PURELY TACTICAL AND THEREFORE THAT IRAN 
IS NOT \"BEYOND REDEMPTION.\" 
 
--SAUDI ARABIA IS SIMILARLY REVILED FOR ITS ENORMOUS 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ASAD REGIME,  BUT WE HEAR 
PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT RIYADH HAS ALSO PROVIDED 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND REFUGE TO CERTAIN OF THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERS.  SAUDI DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS HERE 
STOUTLY DENY ANY ASSOCIATION WITH ANY SYRIAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERS, AVERRING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN 
AND MUCH TO LOSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE ALMOST 
CERTAINLY MUSLIM BROTHERS IN MECCA, WHOSE PRESENCE IS 
TOLERATED BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS UNDERPINNINGS AND 
TIES TO THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
 
THE \"PARDON\":  PUBLICITY PLOY AND SIGN OF BROTHERHOOD 
WEAKNESS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11.  INTO THE APPARENT  THREE-YEAR VOID IN 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY, ASAD HAS NOW INJECTED HIS 
LIMITED PARDON OF JANUARY 25.  SOME SYRIANS AND 
DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED SURPRISE TO US 
THAT ASAD DID NOT MAKE SOME \"GRAND GESTURE\" SOME MONTHS 
AGO, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF HIS RECOVERY IN HEALTH 
AND RIF\'AT\'S EXILE.  HOWEVER, ASAD PROBABLY NEEDED ALL 
OF 1984 TO BUILD BACK FROM THE CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY 
HIS HEART ATTACK, AS SHOWN BY HIS CONTINUAL DEFERRAL 
OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS. 
 
- 
12.  THE \"PARDON\" IS FAR FROM A GENERAL AMNESTY: 
 
--IT DECLARES:  \"CONTACTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HELD 
BETWEEN US AND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD ORGANIZA- 
TION (TANZIM AL\'TALI\'A) LEADERSHIP ABROAD.\"  THE NAME, 
\"TANZIM AL\'TALI\'A,\" IS NOT THE SAME AS \"AL-TALI\'A AL- 
MUQATILA LIL -MUJAHIDIN,\" THE OFFICIAL NAME THAT HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE \"MILITARY TENDENCY.\" 
 
--\"ABROAD\" IMPLIES THAT THE AMNESTY IS INTENDED ONLY FOR 
EXILES, NOT FOR MUSLIM BROTHERS IN PRISON IN SYRIA. 
(A TALI\'A SPOKESMAN IN 1982 CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE 
10,000  MUSLIM BROTHERS IN JAIL IN SYRIA.  ALL OF OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS ON THE SUBJECT ASSERT THAT THERE ARE 
\"THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS\" OF SYRIANS IN JAIL, ACCUSED 
OF BEING OR ASSOCIATING WITH MUSLIM BROTHERS, DATING 
FROM THE LATE SEVENTIES BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THE HAMA 
PERIOD.  INDEED, IT IS COMMON TO MEET SYRIANS WHO HAVE 
SOME FAMILY MEMBER, OR WHO KNOW OTHERS WHO HAVE SOME 
FAMILY MEMBER, IN JAIL UNDER ACCUSATIONS RELATING TO 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  10,000 SEEMS A FAIR ESTIMATE-- 
AND A VERY LARGE NUMBER FOR A SMALL COUNTRY.) 
 
--IT DECLARES THAT \"THIS LEADERSHIP\" HAS EXPRESSED \"NEW 
CONVICTIONS\" RECOGNIZING THE PERFIDY OF THE \"PLOT 
CONCOCTED AGAINST SYRIA\" BY \"THOSE TRADING IN THE NAME 
OF RELIGION.\"  THIS FORMULATION SUGGESTS THAT MUSLIM 
FANATICS--IF INDEED THE TALI\'A--HAD A CHANGE OF HEART, 
INCLUDING A RECOGNITION THAT THEIR PREVIOUS ACTS 
AGAINST THE ASAD REGIME IN THE NAME OF ISLAM WERE 
ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO ISLAM. 
 
--IT DECLARES THAT \"THIS LEADERSHIP\" HAS EXPRESSED, IN 
ITS NAME AND \"THE NAME OF MANY OF THE BROTHERHOOD 
BASES,\" THE DESIRE TO \"RETURN TO THE HOMELAND\" AND THAT 
\"THIS PARDON WILL BE APPLICABLE TO EVERYONE WHO 
RETURNS TO HIS HOMELAND WITH AN OPEN HEART.\"  IT 
SUGGESTS, THUS, THAT THE PARDON--WHILE ONLY ADDRESSED TO 
EXILES--IS SOMEHOW ADDRESSED NOT TO ONE GROUP ONLY, 
BUT TO ALL BROTHERHOOD \"BASES\" AND \"EVERYONE\" WHO 
SOMEHOW \"PROVES\" HIS ALLEGIANCE AND CHANGE OF HEART. 
 
--FINALLY, IT DECLARES THAT \"SOME OF THESE CITIZENS 
HAVE ALREADY RETURNED\" UNDER A \"SPECIAL PARDON FROM 
HAFIZ AL-ASAD.\" 
 
13.  ON THE VERY SAME DAY AS THIS \"PARDON,\" THE FINAL 
DECLARATION OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS WAS ISSUED, 
CARRYING AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MESSAGE.  DURING THE 
CONGRESS, WE HAD HEARD THAT TWO \"SECRET\" SESSIONS 
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AND 
THESE REPORTS WERE BORNE OUT IN THE FINAL DECLARATION. 
 
--\"DURING ITS STUDY OF THE DOMESTIC SITUATION, THE 
CONGRESS DISCUSSED THE PLOT OF THE AGENT MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD GANG, WHICH HAS SOUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THE 
PLANS OF IMPERIALISM AND SOME OF ITS TOOLS IN THE 
REGION THROUGH BASES OF SUPPORT, SUPPLIES, TRAINING, 
AND HELP FROM JORDAN AND IRAQ.  THE CONGRESS ALSO 
REVIEWED THE MEASURES TAKEN TO LIQUIDATE THAT AGENT 
GANG AND TO PURSUE ITS ELEMENTS...IT PRAISED THE MEASURES 
EXERTED...TO LIQUIDATE THIS GANG AND TO FOIL THE 
IMPERIALIST-ZIONIST SCHEMES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.\" 
 
- 
THERE IS NOT A WORD OF LENIENCY IN THIS FORMULATION.  IN 
EFFECT, IT IS A STATEMENT THAT IMPLIES THAT HAMA WAS 
NECESSARY, THE REGIME IS NOT SORRY ABOUT IT, AND IT 
WILL DO IT AGAIN IF NECESSARY. 
 
14.  THUS THIS \"PARDON\" IS HIGHLY SUSPECT ON SEVERAL 
COUNTS: 
 
--IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE THOUSANDS OF MUSLIM BROTHERS 
WHO ARE IN PRISON.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE VERY 
MANY MUSLIM BROTHER EXILES BEING LURED BACK TO  SYRIA 
WITHOUT A DEMONSTRATION THAT OTHERS, NOT SO FORTUNATE 
TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLEE, WOULD NOT ALSO BE FORGIVEN. 
IN FACT, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REPORTS THAT SOME OF 
THOSE IN PRISON--A \"SMALL NUMBER,\" OR \"MORE THAN A 
HUNDRED,\" OR \"FIVE HUNDRED\"--HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
(ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, MOST OF THESE WERE WOMEN). 
ON THE OTHER HAND, MOST OF OUR CONTACTS KNOW OF NO 
PROGRESS WHATSOEVER ON RELEASE OF MUSLIM BROTHERS, AND 
THEIR INQUIRIES INTO THE FATE OF RELATIVES CONTINUE 
TO MEET THE SAME DEADLY SILENCE AS HAS PREVAILED FOR 
THREE YEARS.  BY THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ACCOUNT, THERE 
SCARCELY SEEMS TO DE THE KIND OF DEMONSTRATION OF 
\"GOOD INTENTIONS\" THAT MUSLIM BROTHERS WITH A HEALTHY 
INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION WOULD REQUIRE BEFORE 
CONTEMPLATING A RETURN TO SYRIA.  (THE REGIME WOULD HAVE 
A MAJOR PROBLEM IN GRANTING A GENERAL AMNESTY.  MANY 
OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO WERE IMPRISONED HAVE 
UNDOUBTEDLY \"DISAPPEARED\"--ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, 
SEVERAL WERE INTENTIONALLY \"RELEASED\" FROM PALMYRA 
PRISON AND THEN HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED--AND OTHERS 
TORTURED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE 
\"PRESENTABLE\" TO THE PUBLIC.) 
 
--THE \"PARDON\" IS EXTREMELY VAGUE ON HOW AN EXILE IS 
MEANT TO \"PROVE\" HIS SINCERITY AND ALLEGIANCE, ANOTHER 
FACTOR THAT WOULD DISSUADE \"HOMESICK\" EXILES. 
 
--IT TALKS ABOUT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD 
ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP ABROAD, RATHER THAN THE LEADER- 
SHIP OF THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF THE WARRIORS. 
\"VANGUARD\" (TALI\'A) IS A COMMONLY USED CATCHWORD IN 
SYRIAN POLITICAL PARLANCE.  THE SYRIANS THUS MAY NOT BE 
REFERRING TO THE SAME GROUP; THEY MAY EVEN BE 
INTENTIONALLY USING PART OF THE NAME IN AN EFFORT TO 
DISCREDIT THE \"MILITARY TENDENCY\" FURTHER.  IT IS 
NOTEWORTHY THAT IF \'ADNAN \'UQLA, THE TALI\'A \"CALIPH,\" 
IS IN FACT IN A SYRIAN PRISON, THE SYRIANS HAVE 
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED HIM IN THEIR FORMULATION. 
 
--FINALLY, THE VERY NATURE OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERS--AND ESPECIALLY THE WELL-KNOWN FANATICISM OF 
THE TALI\'A--IS SUCH AS TO SUGGEST THAT VERY FEW OF THEIR 
MEMBERS, MUCH LESS THEIR LEADERS, WOULD ACCEPT THE 
HUMILIATION OF KOWTOWING TO HAFIZ AL-ASAD. 
 
15.  NEVERTHELESS,  WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT 
SYRIAN SECURITY OFFICIALS DID CONDUCT NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLING ITSELF 
\"TALI\'A\"--MEANT TO BE THE TALI\'A OF \'ADNAN \'UQLA--A 
PROCESS THAT SUPPOSEDLY BEGAN WITH THE INTERVENTION OF 
SA\'ID SHA\'BAN AND POSSIBLY THE IRANIANS.  WE EVEN HAVE 
A REPORT THAT SOME \"FEW HUNDRED\" TALI\'A MEMBERS HAVE 
RETURNED TO SYRIA FROM REFUGE IN SAUDI ARABIA, THANKS 
TO THE INTERVENTION OF CROWN PRINCE \'ABDALLAH, WHEN HE 
WAS IN DAMASCUS JANUARY 21-FEBRUARY 1 (AND POSSIBLY 
ALSO DURING HIS SEPTEMBER 1984 VISIT), AND THAT TALI\'A 
MAY EVEN JOIN THE SYRIAN \"NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE FRONT\"* 
 
- 
16.  IF THESE REPORTS HAVE ANY TRUTH TO THEM, THEY 
ARE THE STRONGEST INDICATION YET OF THE LOW STATE TO 
WHICH THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS HAVE FALLEN.  IN 
SEPTEMBER 1982, AN UNNAMED SPOKESMAN FOR TALI\'A, IN 
AN INTERVIEW WITH LE MATIN, POINTED A FINGER AT THE 
\"POLITICAL TENDENCY,\" DISDAINFULLY ACCUSING ITS LEADERS 
(SA\'D AL-DIN ET AL) OF BEING ON THE VERGE OF JOINING A 
COALITION WITH ASAD.  NOW IT MAY BE THAT TALI\'A ITSELF, 
OR SOME ELEMENTS IN IT, HAVE DONE JUST THAT. 
 
17.  GIVEN THE RELIABILITY OF THESE RECENT REPORTS, WE 
ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT A SMALL OR FRINGE ELEMENT 
OF THE TALI\'A, OR AN ELEMENT OF MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO 
HAVE ASSUMED  THE NAME, HAS ENGAGED IN THESE NEGOTIA- 
TIONS WITH THE SYRIANS.  THE SHA\'BAN CONNECTION IS 
PLAUSIBLE--INDEED, OUR SAUDI AND JORDANIAN DIPLOMATIC 
CONTACTS HERE, WITHOUT PROMPTING, INDICATED TO US THAT 
THERE WERE NUMEROUS \"MEN FROM TRIPOLI\" MILLING ABOUT 
IN DAMASCUS IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
THE \"PARDON,\" AND THEY BELIEVE \"TRIPOLI\" WAS WHAT IT 
WAS ALL ABOUT.  A SWEDISH DIPLOMAT HERE, A LONG-TIME 
FOLLOWER OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS (APPARENTLY 
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM IN SWEDEN), INFORMS US ALSO 
THAT HE HAD HEARD, AT THE TIME OF SHA\'BAN\'S REMARK- 
ABLE VISIT TO DAMASCUS IN SEPTEMBER 1984, THAT SHA\'BAN 
HAD RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE RETURN TO SYRIA OF SOME 
OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE 
IN TRIPOLI.  (THE SWEDE ALSO SAYS THAT SHA\'BAN, A 
MORTAL ENEMY OF ASAD, ONLY AGREED TO COME TO DAMASCUS, 
AT IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHAMENEI\'S URGING, WHEN 
KHAMENEI AGREED TO KEEP AN IRANIAN MINISTER IN TRIPOLI 
AND ASAD AGREED TO SEND A HIGH-RANKING SYRIAN OFFICIAL 
TO TRIPOLI AS GUARANTORS OF SHA\'BAN\'S SAFE RETURN.) 
SA\'ID SHA\'BAN MADE HIS SECOND VISIT TO SYRIA ON 
FEBRUARY 20, THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD THAT THE 
LATTER VISIT HAD A MUSLIM BROTHERS CONNECTION. 
 
18.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE \"PARDON\" FOR MUSLIM 
BROTHERS FORMED A PART OF THE PRE-REFERENDUM 
PUBLICITY BUILD-UP.  IT IS CLEAR THAT ASAD WANTED TO 
GO INTO THE REFERENDUM WITH HIS \"RELIGIOUS FLANK\" AS 
WELL COVERED AS POSSIBLE.  IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 
THE REFERENDUM ON FEBRUARY 10, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESS 
WAS REPLETE WITH HEADLINES OF ACCLAIM FOR ASAD FROM 
EACH OF THE PRINCIPAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN SYRIA, 
INCLUDING EVEN A JOINT MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN DECLARATION. 
ASAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL TO APPEAR TO BE A DEVOUT 
MUSLIM--DESPITE BEING AN ALAWI AND THUS DESPISED BY 
DEVOUT MUSLIMS--AND HE HAS ALWAYS TROTTED OUT CHRISTIAN 
LEADERS AT TIMES WHEN IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE 
NATIONAL UNITY; BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN QUITE SO MUCH OF 
IT ALL AT ONCE. 
 
19.  BUT HIS NEED FOR THIS \"PARDON\" AT THIS TIME GOES 
DEEPER.  HAMA CONTINUES AS A VERY PRESENT, VERY 
HORRIBLE NATIONAL MEMORY.  NOTHING LIKE HAMA HAD EVER 
OCCURRED IN LIVING MEMORY.  (JAMAL PASHA\'S HUPPRESSION 
OF CHRISTIAN MINORITIES INVOLVED TURKISH BUTCHERY 
OF CHRISTIANS, MOSTLY ARMENIANS AND MARONITES--THUS 
THIS IS NOT A MEMORY OF SYRIANS BUTCHERING FELLOW 
SYRIANS.)  WE BELIEVE THAT ASAD SOUGHT TO GO INTO HIS 
THIRD TERM \"CLEANSED,\" WITH THE HORROR OF HAMA PUT 
BEHIND HIM.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE MEMORY OF HAMA HAS 
ITS UTILITY, IN REMINDING THE PEOPLE THAT ASAD IS 
WILLING TO BE UNIMAGINABLY TOUGH WHEN HE HAS TO BE. 
THUS, HE GAVE DOUBLE, APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY 
MESSAGES--THE \"PARDON,\" AND THE EIGHTH CONGRESS FINAL 
DECLARATION ON THE SAME DAY STRESSING CONTINUED TOUGH- 
NESS.  INDEED, THE \"PARDON\" IS ALSO QUITE TOUGH IN 
ITS CONDEMNATION OF THOSE \"TRADING IN THE NAME OF 
RELIGION\" AND \"DISTORTING  THE NOBLE RELIGION.\" 
ASAD SEEKS TO GIVE AN IMAGE OF BEING \"BENEVOLENT,\" 
\"TOUGH,\" AND THE \"UPHOLDER OF RELIGION\" (THOUGH ALAWI) 
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

SUBJECT:  IRANIANS IN DAMASCUS AND NOTES FROM TEHRAN 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  A RECENT VISIT OF FAMILY FRIENDS FROM TEHRAN FILLED 
IN SOME GAPS IN OUR INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF IRANIAN 
TOURIST-PILGRIM FLIGHTS TO DAMASCUS AND PRODUCED SOME 
COMMENTS ON THE SITUATION IN TEHRAN.  THE FLIGHTS OF 
JUMBO JETS FROM TEHRAN, WHICH USED TO BRING 2,500 
IRANIANS TO DAMASCUS EACH WEEK, WERE INTERRUPTED IN 
MARCH WHEN IRAQ WARNED AIRLINES TO AVOID IRANIAN 
AIRSPACE.  FLIGHTS FROM TEHRAN HAVE GRADUALLY RESUMED 
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT 
SYRIAN AIR WILL ALSO SOON HAVE PLANES ON THE TEHRAN RUN. 
IRANIAN AIR FLIGHTS PROCEED FROM TEHRAN TO MESHED AND 
NORTH INTO THE SOVIET UNION AND OVER TURKEY TO 
SYRIA -- FOUR HOURS IN ALL.  SEATS FROM TEHRAN ARE 
NOW EXTREMELY SCARCE WITH FAMILIES OF MARTYRS HAVING 
PRIORITY.  FOR SOME REASON -- POSSIBLY NEW FLIGHTS -- 
SEATS ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE RETURN FROM DAMASCUS 
TO TEHRAN. 
 
3.  EACH IRANIAN BEFORE LEAVING IRAN IS ALLOWED TO 
EXCHANGE AT THE OFFICIAL RATE THE EQUIVALENT OF $100 
FOR WHICH HE RECEIVES CASH THAT MUST BE EXCHANGED 
FOR SYRIAN CURRENCY AT THE AIRPORT ON ARRIVAL.  HAVING 
PAID THE EQUIVALENT IN TEHRAN, HE IS GIVEN A VOUCHER 
FOR AN ADDITIONAL $400 AT THE TOURIST RATE, WHICH CAN 
BE PICKED UP AT THE SEMIRAMIS HOTEL IN DAMASCUS.  BUS 
TRANSPORTATION FROM TEHRAN TAKES FOUR DAYS, ONE OF WHICH 
IS SPENT ON FRONTIER FORMALITIES. 
 
4.  IRANIAN TOURISTS OFTEN SUPPLEMENT THEIR CASH BY BRING- 
ING GOODS WITH THEM FROM TEHRAN.  THE CAVIAR SUPPLY HAS 
BEEN CUT DOWN, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF RECENT RESTRICTIONS 
AT TEHRAN AIRPORT WHERE PURCHASES BY RELIGIOUS PILGRIMS ARE 
CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE.  IRANIAN VISITORS SHOP IN 
DAMASCUS FOR SOUVENIRS AND ITEMS NOT AVAILABLE IN 
TEHRAN. 
 
5.  RELIGIOUS DUTIES CONSIST OF VISITING THE SHRINE IN 
THE OMAYYAD MOSQUE IN DAMASCUS WHERE HUSSEIN\'S HEAD IS 
BURIED.  MORE IMPORTANT FOR MOST IS THE VISIT TO THE 
DAMASCUS SUBURB WHERE SIT ZAYNAB, SISTER OF HUSSEIN 
AND HASSAN, IS BURIED.  ACCORDING TO TRADITION, ZAYNAB 
WAS BROUGHT TO DAMASCUS AT THE SAME TIME AS HUSSEIN\'S 
HEAD.  HER SHRINE IS SELDOM MENTIONED IN TOURIST 
LITERATURE AND WAS, UNTIL THE IRANIAN INFLUX, SCARCELY 
EVER VISITED.  HOWEVER, SINCE IRAN IS THE RESTING PLACE 
OF ONLY ONE OF THE TWELVE IMANS AND IRAQ, RICH IN SHI\'A 
REMAINS, IS OUT OF BOUNDS, SIT ZAYNAB\'S TOMB HAS 
ACQUIRED A NEW PROMINENCE. 
 
6.  ALTHOUGH A SIMILAR SHRINE IN IRAN OR IRAQ WOULD NOT 
BE OPEN TO NON-MOSLEMS, SYRIAN TOLERANCE PREVAILS HERE, 
WITH THE ONLY WARNING IN ENGLISH BEING:  \"MAKE UP LADIES 
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER.\"  BLACK CHADORS ARE AVAILABLE 
AT THE OUTER GATE WHERE THERE IS NO ENTRY FEE.  THE 
ARCHITECTURAL STYLE IS PERSIAN, BUT THE MODERN SQUARE 
TILES WILL NEED MANY YEARS TO DEVELOP CHARACTER.  THE 
INNER  SANCTUM IS IN THE IRANIAN TRADITION, HEAVILY 
DECORATED WITH MIRRORED CEILING AND SILVER GRILL AROUND 
THE TOMB. THE SCENE INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE COULD BE FROM 
AN ORIENTALIST PAINTING, WITH WOMEN IN CHADORS AND MEN 
IN TURBANS AND LONG GARMENTS.  THERE WERE ONLY A FEW 
PERSONS WHO LOOKED LIKE REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS IN MILITARY 
UNIFORM DURING OUR VISIT ON A SATURDAY DURING NOON 
PRAYERS.  THERE ARE NO PICTURES OF KHOMEINI ANYWHERE TO 
BE SEEN IN THE SHRINE AREA OR THE NEARBY STREETS.  THIS 
COULD HARDLY BE ACCIDENTAL AND PROBABLY REFLECTS A SYRIAN 
REQUIREMENT.  (ASAD\'S PICTURE IS ALSO ABSENT.) 
 
7. COMMENTS BY OUR PROFESSIONAL AND MERCHANT CLASS 
VISITORS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN TEHRAN AGREED WITH OTHER 
RECENT REPORTS REGARDING A GROWING MALAISE AS THE PUBLIC 
AWAITS THE END OF THE KHOMEINI ERA.  WHETHER RUMOR OR 
FACT, OUR FRIENDS REPORTED FREQUENT MANIFESTATIONS OF 
ANTI-REGIME FEELING, INCLUDING WALL SLOGANS AND BOMBINGS 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDIA.  THEY ALSO 
SPOKE OF CONSIDERABLE USE OF ALCOHOL AMONG THE PUBLIC, 
WITH OPIUM THE PREFERRED DRUG OF THE CLERGY.  MONTAZERI, 
WHO IS REPORTEDLY A HEAVY USER, IS DISMISSED AS A NOBODY. 
PREDICTIONS RE KHOMENEI\'S SUCCESSOR CENTER ON RAFSANJANI. 
OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IS ALSO REPORTEDLY STRONG AND 
GROWING STRONGER.  THOUGH OUR VISITORS DID NOT SEEM TO 
BELIEVE CLERICAL RULE HAD A LONG-TERM FUTURE IN IRAN, 
THEY COULD NOT SUGGEST WHEN OR HOW THE RETURN TO A MORE 
TRADITIONAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD OCCUR. THE ONLY 
POSITIVE THING THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE KHOMEINI REGIME 
WAS THAT IT HAD, FOR THE TIME BEING, SUBDUED THE TUDEH 
PARTY.

E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR 
TAGS:  PTER, KPAL, KPRP, JO, IS, LE, IS, SY 
SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND TERRORISM 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  SYRIA CONSIDERS ITSELF A TRUE CONFRONTATION 
STATE--EVERYTHING THAT CONTRIBUTES TO DEFEATING THE 
ENEMY IS POSITIVE.  THE \"STRUGGLE\" PROVIDES A GUIDE 
FOR CHOOSING THE TARGET AND LEGITIMIZES THE MEANS, 
INCLUDING TERRORISM, WHICH IS VIEWED AS COST-EFFECTIVE. 
SYRIA IS HOST TO PLENTY OF WILLING HELPERS, PRIMARILY 
LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED AND RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS, 
BUT ALSO KURDS AND ARMENIANS.  AS LONG AS COMMON FOES 
ARE TARGETED,  SYRIA TOLERATES TERRORIST ACTIONS BY 
OTHERS.  RETALIATION AGAINST SYRIA WOULD HAVE PROBLEMATIC 
EFFECTS, AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DETER FUTURE TERRORISM. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  SYRIA HAS A RECORD OF SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND 
A HISTORY OF HARBORING GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE 
IN TERRORIST ACTS.  SYRIA HAS ALSO BEEN A VICTIM OF 
A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTIONS.  SYRIA 
CONSIDERS ITSELF A CONFRONTATION STATE IN THE PURE SENSE-- 
IT IS AT WAR WITH ISRAEL AND EVERYTHING THAT CONTRIBUTES 
TO THE EFFORT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY IS POSITIVE.  SPECIFIC 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS WILL B MOUNTED OR NOT, ACCORDING 
TO THIS CRITERION. 
 
4.  OTHER ARAB STATES WHOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL IS 
NOT JURIDICALLY ONE OF PEACE DO NOT CONDONE OR PROMOTE 
TERRORISM.  IN THIS MESSAGE WE EXAMINE SOME ASPECTS OF 
SYRIA THAT MAKE IT DIFFERENT. 
 
--------------------------- 
WHAT MAKES SYRIA DIFFERENT? 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  THE BA\'THI,  MINORITY GOVERNMENT OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD IS 
BUILT UPON AN IDEOLOGY THAT INCREASINGLY HAS COME TO 
FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF SYRIA\'S ROLE IN CONFRONTING THE 
\"ZIONIST ENEMY,\" ISRAEL.  SYRIA PERCEIVES THAT IT 
STANDS ALONE AMONG THE STATES NEIGHBORING ISRAEL IN 
PROMOTING \"REAL\" CONFRONTATION, SINCE JORDAN AND EGYPT 
HAVE FALLEN FROM GRACE  INTO \"CAPITULATIONISM,\" LEBANON 
HAS TURNED INWARD, AND IRAQ HAS SHIFTED TOWARDS THE 
ARAB RIGHT.  SYRIA\'S REGIONAL ISOLATION--AS A RADICAL 
STATE WITH TIES TO IRAN AND LIBYA--ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO 
THE STRONG SENSE OF UNIQUENESS FELT BY THE SYRIAN LEADER- 
SHIP.  GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY ARE ADDITIONAL FACTORS: 
SYRIA IS STRATEGICALLY PLACED ON THE CROSSROADS OF THE 
LEVANT WITH ACCESS TO AND VULNERABILITY FROM MANY 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.  DEMOGRAPHICALLY, SYRIA\'S 
POPULATION IS HETEROGENOUS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, 
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF PALESTINIANS, KURDS, AND ARMENIANS. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SYRIA WHO HAVE 
GRIEVANCES AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE, SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
 
6.  WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES SYRIA, HOWEVER, IS ITS 
CANDID ASSESSMENT THAT TERRORISM IS COST EFFECTIVE. 
IN PART, THIS IS A FUNCTION OF THE DETERRENTS TO ANY 
DIRECT MILITARY ACTION POSED BY SUPERIOR ISRAELI FORCES 
OR ARAB OPINION.  SYRIA IS ALSO NOT THE FIRST REGIME 
TO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ONE EFFECTIVE WAY OF DEALING 
WITH POLITICAL OPPOSITION IS TO EXTINGUISH IT.  ANOTHER 
FACTOR WHICH WE CANNOT ASSESS PRECISELY IS THE EXTENT 
AND NATURE OF SOVIET SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES 
WHICH MAY BE DIRECTED FROM SYRIA.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS 
NOT FAR FETCHED TO CONCEIVE OF A SOVIET ROLE IN PROMOTING 
INSURGENT ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE KURDS AGAINST TURKEY 
OR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OTHER GROUPS AGAINST 
EUROPEAN TARGETS.  (THE SOVIETS HERE STOUTLY MAINTAIN 
THEIR OPPOSITION TO, AND NON-INVOLVEMENT IN, ANY SUCH 
ACTIVITIES.) 
 
7.  SYRIA DOES NOT LABEL THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE 
ISRAELI ENEMY AS \"TERRORISM.\"  INDEED, IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS WITH MOST AVERAGE SYRIANS THE ISSUE 
OF TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL; IT IS CONSIDERED AN 
OXYMORON, I.E., IF AMERICANS FOUGHT TO LIBERATE THEIR 
LAND FROM BRITISH OCCUPIERS, THEN LEBANESE AND 
PALESTINIANS ARE ALSO FREEDOM FIGHTERS, NOT TERRORISTS. 
MOREOVER, SYRIA DEFINES THE \"NATIONAL RESISTANCE\" 
BROADLY, SO THAT MODERATE ARABS BECOME LEGITIMATE 
TARGETS.  BUT THE OBJNCTIVES ARE ALWAYS THE SAME--UNTIL 
SUCH TIME AS THE ARABS ARE UNITED AND STRONG, SYRIA MUST 
WEAKEN THE ENEMY, DISCOURAGE INDEPENDENT ARAB INITIATIVES, 
AND BLOCK A MODERATE CONSENSUS. 
 
8.  THE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO 
SHORTAGE OF DISAFFECTED, RADICAL PALESTINIANS WHO ARE 
PREPARED TO ACT NOT ONLY AGAINST THE ISRAELIS BUT, 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, AGAINST THE JORDANIANS AND MODERATE 
PALESTINIANS.  THERE ARE WILLING RECRUITS HERE AND 
ELSEWHERE FOR MANY OF THE ACTIONS WHICH COMMONLY ARE 
LABELED SYRIAN-SPONSORED BUT WHICH IN FACT ARE CONDUCTED 
WITHOUT EXPLICIT SYRIAN APPROVAL.  SINCE SYRIA DOES NOT 
GENERALLY OBJECT TO TARGETTING  A COMMON FOE, IT MIGHT, 
THEREFORE, BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CALL THESE TERRORIST 
ACTIONS SYRIAN-TOLERATED. 
 
--------- 
TARGETS 
--------- 
 
9.  ALMOST ANY TARGET IS \"LEGITIMATE.\"  HOWEVER, THE 
PROBABILITY OF A TERRORIST ACT, AS WELL AS ITS LINKAGE 
TO SYRIA, RISES WITH THE DEGREE OF THE TARGET\'S 
ASSOCIATION WITH ISRAEL OR A PEACE PROCESS THAT DOES NOT 
HAVE SYRIAN APPROVAL.  THUS, SYRIA PROBABLY AT WORST 
TOLERATES AND AT BEST IS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL TERRORISM 
SUCH AS THAT BY ARMENIANS OR KURDS AGAINST TURKS.  ON 
THE OTHER HAND, IT COOPERATES ACTIVELY IN TERRORISM 
DIRECTED AGAINST JORDAN, WHEN THE PEACE PROCESS SHOWS LIFE. 
SOMETIMES SYRIA\'S HAND IS QUITE DIRECT, AS IN THE CASES 
OF ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATIONS OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
FIGURES ABROAD AND IN ATTACKS AGAINST IRAQI CITIZENS 
AND FACILITIES.  MORE OFTEN, \"FRIENDS\" DO THE DIRTY 
WORK.  THUS, THE CRAZY-QUILT OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN 
DAMASCUS ALL OCCASIONALLY GET THEIR CHANCE AT THE 
JORDANIANS, FATAH, OR THE ISRAELIS. 
 
-------------- 
RETALIATION 
-------------- 
10.  SINCE THE IDEA OF RETALIATION FOR A TERRORIST ACT 
HAS OCCURRED TO ALL AT SOME POINT, IT IS WORTH CONSIDER- 
ING IN THE CASE OF SYRIA.  OBVIOUSLY, THE GREATEST 
DIFFICULTY IS IN ESTABLISHING SYRIAN COMPLICITY.  THAT 
ASIDE, RETALIATION WOULD MEET HERE WITH A CONTRADICTORY 
RANGE OF EMOTIONS:  IT WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN TYPICALLY 
MIDDLE EAST FASHION, BUT IT WOULD NOT DETER, BECAUSE 
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE TERRORIST ACTIONS THI 
CAUSE AND THEIR DEDICATION TO IT ARE PARAMOUNT.  MORE- 
OVER, FAILURE OF A RETALIATORY ACTION COULD BE 
DISASTROUS.  U.S. POLICY WOULD HAVE TO BE PERCEIVED TO 
BE DIRECT, ACCURATE, AND EFFECTIVE.  (THE IMAGE OF U.S. 
ABILITY TO RESPOND IS THREATENED BY OUR PRESUMED ASSOCIA- 
TION WITH EVENTS SUCH AS THE BIR AL-ABID CAR BOMBING IN 
WEST BEIRUT, NOT TO MENTION THE DECEMBER 1983 AIR STRIKE 
IN THE BIQA\' WHICH RESULTED IN CAPTURE OF A U.S. FLYER.) 
FINALLY, RETALIATION IS A FAVORITE ISRAELI POLICY WHICH 
MOST TERRORIST ANALYSTS ACKNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER WORKED. 
THE U.S. COULD END UP ADDING TO THE PROBLEM BY FURTHER 
ALIENATING ARAB OPINION. 
 
11.  WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED UPON THE QUESTION OF PREEMPTION 
BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW, GIVEN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, 
PREEMPTION WOULD SEEM TO BE LOGICAL AND NECESSARY IF IT 
IS POSSIBLE. 
 
12.  FINALLY, IRANIAN- AND LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM, 
WHICH TAINTS SYRIA BY ASSOCIATION, IS NOT NECESSARILY 
APPROVED OR EVEN CONDONED BY SYRIA.  A GOOD EXAMPLE IS 
HOSTAGE-TAKING IN LEBANON.  THERE IS LITTLE SYRIA CAN 
DO TO PREVENT SUCH ACTIONS WITHOUT PAYING A HIGH PRICE 
IN OTHER NATIONAL INTERESTS.  SYRIA COULD DO MUCH MORE, 
WE BELIEVE, TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOSTAGES AFTER THEY 
ARE TAKEN, BUT PREVENTION OF INDIVIDUAL TERRORIST ACTS 
SUCH AS THOSE OCCURRING NOW IN BEIRUT, IS PROBABLY NOT 
POSSIBLE FOR SYRIA. 
 
13.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

COME BACK TO HIS SENSES, AND DONE SO IN AN EVEN BETTER 
WAY THAN COULD HAVE BEEN HOPED FOR ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO. 
TURAYKI\'S TRIP TO BAGHDAD, ON THE HEELS OF COMING TO

ANY SYRIAN CONCERN HAS BEEN MORE THAN WASHED AWAY IN A 
FLOOD OF IRAQI-LIBYAN RECRIMINATIONS.  THE RAMADAN WAR 
OF THE CAMPS, AS THE SYRIANS PORTRAY IT, HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFULY CONCLUDED; IN ANY EVENT, QADHAFI IS NO LONGER

WAYS THAT COME CLOSE TO ATTACKING SYRIA DIRECTLY.  WHILE 
LEBANON WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM FOR SYRIA,

ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE EYE TO EYE ON IRAQ AND THE ARAB-

2.  SUMMARY:  BY CUTTING OFF OIL TO SYRIA, IRAN 
SIGNALED ITS DISPLEASURE OVER THE MOUNTING SYRIAN DEBT 
TO IRAN, SYRIAN POLICIES IN LEBANON, AND MOVES TOWARD 
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH JORDAN AND IRAQ.  BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 
HOWEVER, PM KASM\'S VISIT TO TEHRAN DECEMBER 1-3 
PRODUCED AGREEMENT THAT THE OIL SHIPMENTS ARE TO BE 
RESUMED.  THE IRANIANS CANNOT EXPECT SIGNIFICANT SYRIAN 
PAYMENT FOR PAST OR PRESENT DELIVERIES, BUT NOW THEY 
SEEM WILLING TO GO AHEAD ANYWAY.  THEY APPARENTLY HAVE 
BEEN REASSURED ABOUT SYRIA\'S RELATIONS WITH JORDAN AND 
IRAQ, AND THEY MAY HAVE BECOME MORE RESIGNED TO SYRIAN 
POLICIES IN LEBANON. ASAD APPEARS TO HAVE EMERGED FROM 
THESE THREE MONTHS OF TENSION WITH IRAN WITH HIS BALANCE 
OF SOURCES OF AID INTACT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SYRIAN PRESSURE, IRANIAN COUNTER PRESSURE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER 1985 WAS ONE OF 
HEIGHTENED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN.  FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN THE RECENT RELATIONSHIP OF THOSE TWO 
COUNTRIES, THE FLOW OF IRANIAN OIL TO SYRIA WAS INTER- 
RUPTED.  AT THE TIME OF THE OIL CUTOFF IN LATE AUGUST, 
WE BELIEVED THAT THE PROXIMATE CAUSE WAS THE EFFECTIVE 
IRAQI BOMBINGS OF KHARG ISALND.  HOWEVER, THE IRANIANS, 
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, WERE ABLE    FAIRLY QUICKLY  TO 
REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO KHARG, WHILE THE OIL CUTOFF 
HAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE PRESENT. 
 
4.  IN SUM, THE IRANIANS WERE SENDING THE SYRIANS A 
SIGNAL.  THAT SIGNAL COINCIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT SYRIAN 
PRESSURE AGAINST THE IRANIANS IN SEVERAL SECTORS. 
FIRST WERE THE PALPABLY INCREASED SYRIAN STRICTURES 
ON HIZBALLAH AND THE SIEGE OF THE IRANIAN-SUPPORTED 
FUNDAMENTALISTS IN TRIPOLI IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY 
OCTOBER, RESULTING IN A DEFEAT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS 
(AND THUS FOR IRAN).  IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD OCCURRED 
PRINCE \'ABDALLAH\'S MISSIONS TO DAMASCUS, AMMAN, AND 
BAGHDAD WHICH LED TO THE PRESENT RECONCILIATION WITH 
JORDAN AND A SPATE OF RUMORS OF A RECONCILIATION WITH 
IRAQ.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRED AGAINST A BACKGROUND 
OF THE MOUNTING SYRIAN DEBT TO IRAN, NOW POSSIBLY 
AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS.  THE IRANIAN 
GOVERNMENT WAS--AND STILL IS--UNDER PRESSURE FROM 
MEMBERS OF THE MAJLIS WHO ARE ANGERED BY SYRIAN FAILURE 
TO PAY ON THE DEBT; AND THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS RECENTLY 
HAD SOME VERY UNSAVORY THINGS TO SAY ABOUT SYRIA. 
 
THE KASM VISIT:  THE HEAT IS OFF 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OR HEARD, THE 
VISIT OF SYRIAN PRIME MINISTER KASM TO IRAN DECEMBER 1-3 
ALLEVIATED MANY OF THESE TENSIONS.  WE HAVE NOT YET 
FOUND SOLID CONFIRMATION THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE 
RESUMED SHIPPING OIL TO SYRIA, BUT A WIDE RANGE OF 
INTERLOCUTORS HERE--BOTH SYRIANS AND DIPLOMATS WHO HAVE 
HEARD FROM THEIR EMBASSIES IN TEHRAN--HAVE BEEN IN AGREE- 
MENT THAT SYRIA GOT ALL OR MOST OF WHAT IT WANTED ON 
THE ECONOMIC FRONT.  MINISTER OF ECONOMY \'IMADI, WHO 
TRAVELED TO TEHRAN WITH KASM, TOLD THE AUSTRALIAN DCM 
THAT THE IRANIANS AGREED TO RESUME OIL DELIVERIES, AND 
THE FRENCH DCM GOT THE SAME MESSAGE DURING A VISIT TO 
THE IRANIAN EMBASSY HERE.  OUR JAPANESE COLLEAGUES 
ASSERT THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE AGREED TO A NEW ONE-YEAR 
SCHEME INVOLVING THE IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF OIL 
SHIPMENTS.  (ACCORDING TO THE JAPANESE, THIS AGREEMENT 
PROVIDES   1 MILLION TONS FREE, 2 MILLION TONS FOR HARD 
CURRENCY, AND 2 MILLION TONS FOR BARTER.  IF SO, THE 
IRANIANS ARE ONCE AGAIN DISINGENUOUS:  IT IS EXTREMELY 
UNLIKELY THE SYRIANS WILL PAY HARD CURRENCY FOR EVEN 
2 MILLION TONS, NOR DO THEY HAVE GOODS WORTH THE 
EQUIVALENT OF 2 MILLION TONS TO BARTER.)  OUR KUWAITI 
COLLEAGUES ASSURE US THAT THE PORTION (THEORETICALLY) 
TO BE PAID FOR IN HARD CURRENCY IS TO BE DELIVERED AT 
\"SIGNIFICANTLY  BETTER RATES\" THAN OBTAINED UNDER THE 
PREVIOUS AGREEMENT OF APRIL 1985.  FROM SUCH REPORTS, 
IT APPEARS THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY 
ARE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH HARD CURRENCY--WHETHER FOR 
THE NEW SHIPMENT OR IN PAYMENT FOR THE OLD.  THE NET 
RESULT IS A SYRIAN VICTORY ON THE KEY DEBT/PAYMENT ISSUE. 
 
6.  MEANWHILE, ON DECEMBER 13-18 THE IRANIANS SENT 
THEIR MINISTER OF ISLAMIC GUIDANCE, MUHAMMAD KHATAMI, 
TO DAMASCUS (REF B).  KHATAMI WAS FULL OF WORDS OF 
PRAISE FOR SYRIA, WAS WARMLY RECEIVED BY ASAD  AND BY A 
HOST OF SYRIAN MINISTERS, SIGNED AN INFORMATION COOPERA- 
TIVE AGREEMENT, OPENED AN IRANIAN CULTURAL COUNCIL IN 
DAMASCUS, AND IN GENERAL GAVE A FURTHER REAFFIRMATION 
OF THE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
THE IRANIANS MAY HAVE GIVEN UP ON SOME POINTS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  WE DO NOT WANT TO OVEREMPHASIZE THE POINT, 
BUT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE NET RESULT OF THESE PAST 
THREE MONTHS OF INCREASED TENSION BETWEEN SYRIA AND 
IRAN IS A RESOLUTION AT SOME EXPENSE TO IRAN.  IF THE 
IRANIANS ARE RESUMING OIL SHIPMENTS AT THE PREVIOUS 
RATE OR NEAR TO IT, THE LOSS IS AN EXPENSIVE ONE--WORTH 
$1 BILLION/YEAR IN OIL.  ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, THE 
IRANIANS HAVE GIVEN UP POINTS AS WELL, 
PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS LEBANON.  THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE 
OF THE KASM VISIT TREATED LEBANON IN A WAY TO SUGGEST 
THAT IRAN NOW ENDORSES SYRIAN POLICIES IN LEBANON. 
SINCE IT IS CLEAR THAT IRAN OPPOSES MANY OF SYRIA\'S 
POLICIES IN LEBANON, THIS ENDORSEMENT IS A REMARKABLE 
PUBLIC CONCESSION.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE PUT AWAY THEIR AMBITIONS FOR A 
FUNDAMENTALIST SHI\'A-DOMINATED STATE IN LEBANON, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE IRAN\'S ALLIES THERE ARE NOT PART OF 
THE SYRIAN-BROKERED TRIPARTITE NEGOTIATION.  WE WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE SYRIANS HAD PRIVATELY 
MADE PROMISES TO THE IRANIANS ABOUT LEBANON.  THE PUBLIC 
STATEMENT MAY, THEREFORE, NOT BE WORTH THE PAPER IT IS 
WRITTEN ON, BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT IRAN MAY BE A 
LITTLE MORE RESIGNED THAN PREVIOUSLY TO SYRIA\'S DETER- 
MINATION TO HAVE ITS WAY IN LEBANON. 
 
8.  AS REGARDS JORDAN AND IRAQ, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE 
SYRIANS HAVE GONE TO SOME LENGTHS TO REASSURE THE 
IRANIANS.  NOTHING HAS COME OF \'ABDALLAH\'S EFFORTS 
FOR SYRIAN RECONCILIATION WITH IRAQ AS YET, AND NOTHING 
IN THE COMMUNIQUE EMERGING FROM TEHRAN WOULD GIVE 
REASON FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT SYRIAN WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE 
RELATIONS WITH IRAQ.  AS FOR JORDAN, ASAD PROBABLY 
AFFIRMED TO THE IRANIANS THAT HE HAS GIVEN UP NOTHING 
AT ALL IN THE PROCESS, I.E., THAT THE RECONCILIATION 
HAS INVOLVED ONLY JORDAN\'S COMING TOWARD SYRIA AND 
NONE OF THE REVERSE. 
 
9.  THE IRANIAN CONCESSIONS ON DEBT AND LEBANON 
ILLUSTRATE HOW IMPORTANT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA 
IS TO IRAN.  THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE PUT EMPHASIS 
ON THE SYRIAN CLOSURE OF THE KIRKUK-HOMS PIPELINE, 
BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PIPELINES, 
THIS IS NO LONGER A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.  THE 
IMPORTANCE OF SYRIA TO IRAN NOW IS POLITICAL.  IRAN 
PLACES GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL VALUE ON NOT HAVING TO 
CONFRONT UNITED ARAB HOSTILITY.  IT ALSO VALUES SYRIAN 
ASSISTANCE IN IRANIAN PURCHASES OF ARMS, ALTHOUGH 
IRAN COULD PROBABLY FIND OTHER AVENUES TO MEET ITS 
MILITARY NEEDS. 
 
10.  SECOND, THE RELIGIOUS-IDEOLOGICAL COMPONENT IS 
IMPORTANT.  IRAN IS AN EVANGELIZING NATION, BOTH 
ON THE ISLAMIC PLANE AND, PARTICULARLY, ON THE SHI\'A 
PLANE.  LEBANON IS A KEY ELEMENT IN THIS MISSION; AND 
SYRIA HOLDS THE KEY TO LEBANON.  MOREOVER, SYRIA IS 
SYMPATHETIC WITH IRAN\'S CRUSADE AGAINST THE SUNNI OVER- 
LORD OF IRAQ, WHICH IS A MAJORITY SHI\'A COUNTRY.  A 
FACTOR OF POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE IS THE SHI\'A/\'ALAWI TIE. 
MANY OF THE IRANIAN MULLAHS VIEW THE \'ALAWIS AS 
HERETICAL AND DESPICABLE; BUT WE ALSO THINK IT LIKELY 
THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE MULLAHS FEEL CLOSER TO THE 
\'ALAWIS THAN TO THE SUNNIS.  FOR HIS PART, ASAD IS 
FIRST AND FOREMOST A SECULAR BA\'THI, BUT WE NEVER 
UNDERESTIMATE HOW DEEP THE ETHNIC STRAINS RUN IN 
SYRIA, AND WE DO NOT EXCLUDE ASAD FROM THESE PREJUDICES. 
THE \'ALAWIS SHARE WITH THE OTHER SYRIAN MINORITIES A 
HOSTILITY TOWARD THE SUNNI MAJORITY; UNDER ASAD, THEY 
HAVE PROCLAIMED THEMSLEVES TO BE ORTHODOX SHI\'A; AND 
ASAD IS THEIR LEADER, AS WELL AS--AND PERHPAS BEFORE 
BEING--LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. 
 
 
ASAD, THE CONSUMMATE BALANCER 
------------------- 
 
11.  WE DOUBT THAT KASM WENT TO IRAN WITH ANY 
SPECIFIC THREATS, BUT IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT ASAD 
LET IT BE KNOWN POLITELY TO THE IRANIANS THAT HE HAD 
OTHER ALTERNATIVES--IN PARTICULAR, TURNING TO THE 
SAUDIS TO MAKE UP FOR THE CUTOFF OF IRANIAN OIL 
DELIVERIES.  IT IS, HOWEVER, A COURSE WHICH ASAD WANTED 
TO AVOID.  THE PRESENT SITUATION--OF HOSTILE BENE- 
FACTORS--IS ONE THAT SUITS ASAD PERFECTLY.  WHILE 
NEITHER OF HIS PRINCIPAL BENEFACTORS IS HAPPY, THEY 
GO ON BEING GENEROUS--IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THEIR 
MUTUAL ANTIPATHY.  THERE IS EVERY LIKELIHOOD, FOR THE 
NEAR TERM, AT LEAST, THAT ASAD WILL BE ABLE TO GO 
ON EXTRACTING LARGESSE FROM BOTH OF THESE GOLDEN GEESE. 
FOR THEIR PART, THE SAUDIS APPEAR TO SEE SOME VALUE IN 
THE SYRIAN RELATIONSHIP TO IRAN, AS THEY HOPE THAT 
SYRIA WILL USE IT TO PRESSURE IRAN NOT TO ATTACK THE 
GULF. 
 
------------ 
CONCLUSION 
------------ 
 
12.  THE REAFFIRMATION OF THE SYRIAN-IRANIAN 
RELATIONSHIP DURING THE KASM VISIT TO TEHRAN INDICATES 
THAT THE TENSIONS OF THE PAST THREE MONTHS HAVE ABATED. 
AS WE HAVE SUGGESTED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING, THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE RESILIENCY IN THE RELATIONSHIP, DESPITE 
THE PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO COUNTRIES\' CULTURES 
AND IDEOLOGIES.  FOR IRAN, THE RELATIONSHIP RESTS ON 
MORE THAN LEBANON OR A PIPELINE, IMPORTANT AS THESE ARE. 
FOR SYRIA, THE ECONOMIC ELEMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT, 
AND ASAD\'S ATTACHMENT.TO IRAN MIGHT FALL BY THE WAYSIDE 
IF IRAN PERSISTED IN WITHHOLDING OIL (INDEED, WE STILL 
AWAIT CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT OIL DELIVERIES HAVE 
RESUMED).  YET, IT IS CLEAR THAT ASAD PREFERS TO HAVE 
IRAN AS ONE OF HIS MAJOR BENEFACTORS, HE IS CONTENT 
WITH THE PRESENT STATE OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR (THOUGH 
AN IRANIAN INVASION OF KUWAIT OR A TOTAL DEFEAT OF 
IRAQ WOULD PRESUMABLY ALTER THIS VIEW--WHILE A \"MERE\" 
SUCCESS NORTH OF BASRA MIGHT NOT), AND HE SHARES WITH 
IRAN AN IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY TOWARD IRAQ AND ISRAEL. 
THE \'ALAWI-SHI\'A BOND MAY BE A FACTOR OF IMPORTANCE.

E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR 
TAGS:  PTER, SY 
SUBJECT:  LIBYAN SUPPORTED TERRORISM 
 
REF:  STATE 98378 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDIUM AND 
LONG-TERM THREAT OF LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM IN 
THE WAKE OF THE MARCH 24-25 EVENTS IN THE GULF OF 
SIDRA, PER REFTEL. 
 
3.  IN OUR VIEW, QADHAFI\'S COFFERS WILL PROBABLY BE 
EVEN MORE OPEN TO ABU NIDAL AND SOME OF THE DAMASCUS- 
BASED PALESTINIANS THAN PREVIOUSLY ON ACCOUNT OF 
THE EVENTS IN THE GULF OF SIDRA.  WHETHER THESE 
GROUPS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN TERRORISM 
FOR THIS REASON IS DIFFICULT TO SAY.  THEY HAVE 
THEIR OWN AGENDA, WOULD OPERATE WITH OR WITHOUT 
QADHAFI, AND ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED WITH 
LIBYAN ISSUES SUCH AS THE GULF OF SIDRA PER SE.  WE 
ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE WHETHER LIBYANS 
WILL THEMSELVES BECOME MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  QADHAFI IS PROBABLY NOW 
MOTIVATED TO PAY A HANDSOME PRICE TO HIRED KILLERS 
TO GET AT AMERICANS, BUT HE WILL PRESUMABLY STILL 
BE CONCERNED THAT ACCOUNTABILITY NOT BE DIRECTLY 
TRACEABLE TO HIM. 
 
4.  WHEN ABU NIDAL COMMITS HIS NEXT OUTRAGE, WE 
THINK IT VERY LIKELY HE WILL CITE THE EVENTS IN 
THE GULF OF SIDRA AS AN EXCUSE.  OTHER DAMASCUS- 
BASED PALESTINIAN GROUPS, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT 
TARGET U.S. INTERESTS, ARE LESS LIKELY TO DO SO. 
 
5.  SYRIA ALLOWS ABU NIDAL TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE 
IN SYRIA AND IN SYRIAN-CONTROLLED LEBANON.  RECENT 
PUBLICITY GIVEN TO ITS CONNECTION TO ABU NIDAL 
HAS BEEN A CAUSE OF SOME EMBARRASSMENT, BUT NOT 
YET SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE SYRIA TO CLOSE THE DOOR 
TO ABU NIDAL.  HOW MUCH SUPPORT SYRIA GIVES ABU NIDAL 
IS DIFFICULT TO SAY. THE SYRIAN STYLE IS 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM QADHAFI\'S--MORE SUBTLE, 
LESS PUBLIC, LESS SELF-CONGRATULATING--AND THE 
SYRIAN FOCUS IS NARROWER, MORE PURELY LOCAL AND 
LESS IDEOLOGICAL. 
 
6.  AS WAS EVIDENT IN THE MARCH 27 DEMONSTRATION 
IN DAMASCUS AGAINST AMERICAN ACTIVITIES IN THE 
GULF OF SIDRA, SYRIAN POLICY IS TO PROTECT U.S. 
FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL IN SYRIA.  SYRIA WANTS TO 
MAINTAIN DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. AND DOES NOT PERCEIVE 
AN INTEREST IN BEING SEEN TO DO HARM AGAINST U.S. 
INTERESTS HERE.  DAMASCUS REMAINS ONE OF THE MORE 
SECURE CITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALTHOUGH IT TOO 
HAS SUFFERED FROM TERRORISM (MORE BOMBS HAVE 
EXPLODED HERE IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS THAN IN AMMAN, 
FOR EXAMPLE). 
 
7.  THERE REMAINS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LIBYA MAY 
ATTEMPT TO STAGE AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL 
OR FACILITIES IN DAMASCUS WITHOUT SYRIAN KNOWLEDGE 
OR APPROVAL.  THERE ARE TWO FACTORS WHICH MITIGATE 
THIS:  THE VIGILANCE OF THE SYRIAN SECURITY 
SERVICES, AND QADHAFI\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE NEGATIVE 
EFFECT SUCH AN ATTACK WOULD HAVE ON SYRIAN-LIBYAN 
RELATIONS. 
 
8.  EXCEPT FOR SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS 
OF THE SA-5 SYSTEM, THE SYRIANS PROBABLY DERIVE 
SATISFACTION FROM THE GULF OF SIDRA INCIDENT. 
IT BROUGHT ARABS TOGETHER AGAINST THE U.S., 
DEFLECTED ARAB LEAGUE ATTENTION FROM THE IRAN-IRAQ 
WAR, AND PRODUCED THE APPEARANCE OF A CLOSER USSR 
TIE TO THE ARABS.  IT WILL NOT MAVE A SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT ON ALREADY COOL BILATERAL 
U.S.-SYRIAN TIES, EXCEPT TO ADD SOMEWHAT TO THE 
PERCEPTION OF THE U.S. AS ANTI-ARAB.

REF:   STATE 165238 
 
1.    CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.    THE RECENT INSTRUCTION TO ATHENS CONCERNING 
ABU NIDAL ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA PROMPTS US TO SUGGEST 
SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE USE 
IN DISCUSSING THIS DIFFICULT SUBJECT WITH FRIENDS 
AND ALLIES. 
 
3.    WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE HERE OF CONTACTS BY 
ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES WITH SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE 
OR WITH ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES WHO PASS THROUGH SYRIA, 
SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST THAT THE TWO 
OFFICES HERE ACT AS A BASE OF SUPPORT FOR ABU NIDAL 
OPERATIONS. 
 
4.    HOWEVER, IN TWO OTHER IMPORTANT WAYS, ABU 
NIDAL FIGURES IN DAMASCUS SEEM TO WORK HAND IN GLOVE 
WITH THE MAIN BODY OF THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
IN LIBYA.  FIRST, LOCAL EUROPEAN EMBASSIES IN 
DAMASCUS HAVE RECEIVED VISITS OF LOCAL ABU NIDAL 
OFFICIALS IN THE AFTERMATH OF ATROCITIES IN AUSTRIA, 
ITALY, FRANCE AND PERHAPS ELSEWHERE.  THE LINE IS 
INVARIABLY THE SAME, VERY SOFTLY BUT FIRMLY SUGGEST 
THAT THE DEATHS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IS REGRETTABLE 
BUT THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS EVERY RIGHT 
TO CARRY OUT SUCH ACTIVITIES AGAINST ISRAELI 
TARGETS.  THEN, IN SOME VERY CAREFUL, INDIRECT 
SENTENCES, THE OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD 
BE POSSIBLE TO AVOID FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THIS 
SORT BY REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS.  NO TERMS HAVE 
BEEN SET IN THE INSTANCES WE KNOW OF AND EXPLICIT 
OFFERS OF NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE.  INSTEAD, 
THE DOOR IS OPENED.  IT IS INTERESTING BY-PRODUCT, 
AND MAYBE A COINCIDENTAL ONE, THAT WITH ABU NIDAL 
REPS IN DAMASCUS EUROPEANS INVARIABLY ASK SYRIA 
TO INTERVENE WITH ABU NIDAL AND HELP THEM RESOLVE 
THEIR PROBLEMS WITH TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
THE PRESENCE OF THESE ABU NIDAL OFFICES IN DAMASCUS, 
THEREFORE, SERVES TO SUBTLY ENHANCE THE OPPORTUNITIES 
SYRIA HAS TO PLAY A DIPLOMATIC ROLE. 
 
5.   THE OTHER FUNCTION OF THESE OFFICES IS INDEED 
CULTURAL AND INFORMATIONAL, AS PRESIDENT ASAD HAS 
CLAIMED, AND IT CONSISTS OF ABU NIDAL REPS HANGING 
OUT IN LOCAL HOTELS AND COLLARING FOREIGN JOURNALISTS 
AND OFFICIALS.  INTERVIEWS ARE OFFERED IN THE BIQA\', 
ALONG WITH ESCORTS AND GUARANTEES OF SAFETY.  ONE 
CBS CREW VISITING DAMASCUS IN THE PAST WEEK SPOKE 
QUITE FRANKLY OF THEIR DISCUSSIONS IN THE SHERATON 
ALONG THESE LINES AND SAID THAT IF AN APPROPRIATE 
INTERVIEW WERE ARRANGED, THAT IS WITH AN APPROPRIATE 
OFFICIAL, CBS WOULD TAKE ITS CAMERA CREW IMMEDIATELY. 
HOWEVER, SYRIANS DO NOT NECESSARILY APPROVE THESE 
CONTACTS BY ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES, AND HAVE ACTED 
QUITE HARSHLY AGAINST SOME JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE TRIED 
TO FOLLOW THEM UP, BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT SYRIA 
PROVIDES ABU NIDAL WITH A PULPIT AND A STAGE WHICH 
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE ELSEWHERE.

E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR 
TAGS:  PREL, PTER, ECON, SY, IR, LE, IZ, IS 
SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND IRAN ON LEBANON:  WHO THREATENS WHOM? 
 
REF:  DAMASCUS 3628 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  IN ITS PRESENT SPARRING WITH IRAN, SYRIA 
PROBABLY DOES NOT HOLD A STRONG LEBANON CARD.  IRAN 
NOW VIES WITH ISRAEL AS THE SECOND-MOST INFLUENTIAL 
FOREIGN POWER IN LEBANON, WHERE SHI\'A FUNDAMENTALISM, 
NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IRAN, HAS BECOME WELL-INGRAINED. 
SYRIA COULD CAUSE IRAN SHORT-TERM DIFFICULTIES BY 
TERMINATING THE IRANIAN PRESENCE IN BA\'LBAKK, AND IT 
COULD AT GREAT COST ATTACK HIZBALLAH (JUST AS IT COULD 
THEORETICALLY ATTACK THE MARONITES).  HOWEVER, TO DO SO 
WOULD NOT ONLY BE A DEPARTURE FROM SYRIA\'S POST-1978 
POLICY OF KEEPING COSTS DOWN IN LEBANON, IT WOULD RISK 
CHANGING THE SHI\'A INTO ACTIVE ANTAGONISTS AGAINST SYRIA. 
THIS POTENTIALLY WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR SYRIA, BOTH IN 
LEBANON AND WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  EVENTS SURROUNDING THE FAILURE OF THE IRAQI-SYRIA 
BORDER MEETING SUGGEST THAT THE IRAN-SYRIA RELATIONSHIP 
HAS SURVIVED A ROCKY PERIOD.  THE PRINCIPAL IRRITANTS 
WERE SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC NEED AND THE TWO COUNTRIES\' SHARPLY 
DIVERGENT GOALS IN LEBANON.  IF THE RELATIONSHIP SEEMS 
FOR THE MOMENT TO HAVE GONE BACK TO \"NORMAL,\" IT IS 
EVIDENTLY BECAUSE THE IRANIANS HAVE GIVEN THE SYRIANS TO 
BELIEVE THAT OIL SUPPLY WILL RESUME WITHOUT SERIOUS 
DEMAND FOR PAYMENT EITHER FOR PRESENT OR PAST SHIPMENTS. 
BUT WHERE DOES LEBANON FIT INTO THE EQUATION?  IT SEEMS 
AXIOMATIC THAT FUNDAMENTALIST IRAN AND SECULAR SYRIA ARE 
ON A LONG-TERM COLLISION COURSE IN LEBANON AND THAT THEY 
HAVE NOT ALTERED THEIR GOALS IN LEBANON, AND WILL NOT DO 
SO.  IN THE MOST RECENT SPARRING, THE QUESTION ARISES 
WHETHER IRAN FELT CONSTRAINED BY THE PROSPECT OF A SYRIAN 
CLAMPDOWN AGAINST HIZBALLAH, OR--TO THE CONTRARY, AS SOME 
PRESS REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED--WHETHER SYRIA FELT ALARMED 
OVER POSSIBLE IRAN/HIZBALLAH ACTIONS AGAINST SYRIAN 
INTERESTS.  WHO THREATENS  WHOM OVER LEBANON? 
 
4.  WE DOUBT THAT IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
BESHARATI DELIVERED BALD THREATS TO THE SYRIANS WHEN HE 
MADE HIS JUNE 5-15 TRIP TO SYRIA AND LEBANON.  BUT WE 
ARE STRUCK BY THE BOLDNESS OF HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND 
ACTIONS; THE HIGH LEVEL AT WHICH HE WAS RECEIVED IN 
DAMASCUS BEFORE AND AFTER GOING TO LEBANON--WHERE HE 
ENGAGED IN A NEGOTIATING TRACK ON THE CAMPS WAR SEPARATE 
FROM KHADDAM\'S--; SYRIA\'S POSITIVE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON 
IRAN SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE FAILURE OF THE IRAQ-SYRIA 
BORDER MEETING; AND INDICATORS OF SYRIAN TIMIDITY TOWARD 
IRAN VIS-A-VIS LEBANON. 
 
5.  OF THESE INDICATORS, WE NOTE ESPECIALLY LEBANON 
BA\'TH PARTY CHIEF \'ASIM QANSUH\'S REMARKS JUNE 12 (REFTEL). 
QANSUH WAS PROVEN WRONG ABOUT SYRIAN MILITARY 
INTERVENTION AT MASHGHARA--THE SYRIANS DID EVENTUALLY AND 
TARDILY INTERVENE--AND ONE FACTOR IN SYRIAN HESITANCY 
MAY HAVE BEEN CONCERN ABOUT ISRAELI REACTION. 
NEVERTHELESS, IT IS CLEAR FROM WHAT QANSUH SAID THAT THE 
SYRIANS WERE RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON HIZBALLAH AND OFFEND 
IRAN. 
 
6.  IN OUR VIEW, NEITHER SYRIA NOR IRAN IS IN A POSITION 
IN LEBANON TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THREATS.  EACH HAS 
REASON TO BE ALARMED AT THE OTHER\'S ACTIVITIES AND 
AMBITIONS IN LEBANON, BUT THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH 
ELSEWHERE--FOR SYRIA, THE PROSPECT OF VIRTUALLY FREE OIL 
IN LARGE QUANTITY--TO ALLOW LEBANON TO SOUR THE OVERALL 
RELATIONSHIP. 
 
7.  SYRIA HAS GIVEN IRAN A FEW KNOCKS IN LEBANON, BUT 
NONE OF THESE HAS BEEN LARGE ENOUGH TO HARM THE RELATION- 
SHIP.  SYRIA CLAMPED DOWN ON IRAN\'S SUNNI ALLIES IN 
TRIPOLI, IT HAS ENGAGED IN OCCASIONAL ALTERCATIONS WITH 
HIZBALLAH, AND NOW IT HAS INTERVENED IN MASHGHARA BECAUSE 
OF HIZBALLAH\'S ATTACKS AGAINST ITS SSNP ALLY.  BUT WHAT 
SYRIA HAS FAILED TO DO IS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE.  THE 
IRANIAN GUARD PRESENCE IN SYRIAN-\"CONTROLLED\" LEBANON 
CONTINUES AS BEFORE; IRAN CONTINUES TO MOVE SUPPLIES TO 
HIZBALLAH VIA SYRIA, VIRTUALLY UNIMPEDED; AND THE SYRIANS 
HAVE BEEN LIMP AND INEFFECTUAL IN PUSHING IRAN ON THE 
HOSTAGES.  MEANWHILE, AS HIZBALLAH HAS GAINED IN STRENGTH 
IN RECENT YEARS, SO HAS IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN LEBANON 
INCREASED MARKEDLY.  IRAN NOW, WE WOULD JUDGE, VIES WITH 
ISRAEL AS THE SECOND-MOST INFLUENTIAL FOREIGN POWER IN 
LEBANON. 
 
8.  BY ALLOWING A REVOLUTIONARY GUARD PRESENCE AND GIVING 
THE IRANIANS EASY ACCESS SINCE 1982, SYRIA MAY HAVE 
ACCELERATED THE PACE OF GROWTH OF HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN 
INFLUENCE.  HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION IS THE SINGLE 
MOST DYNAMIC AND ALLURING MOVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER 
THE PAST DECADE; IT WAS BOUND TO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY 
IMPACT ON THE LEBANESE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  IT IS OPEN TO 
QUESTION HOW MUCH SYRIA COULD HAVE DONE TO STEM THE TIDE. 
THERE ALWAYS WERE, AND STILL ARE, OTHER ROUTES--THAN 
THROUGH SYRIA--FOR IRAN TO REACH AND INFLUENCE THE HIGHLY 
RECEPTIVE LEBANESE SHI\'A.  THE SYRIANS HAVE ACTIVELY 
ATTEMPTED TO COUNTERBALANCE THE IRANIANS BY GIVING SUPPORT 
TO NABIH BARRI, BUT WITH WHAT LONG-TERM EFFECT REMAINS 
TO BE SEEN. 
 
9.  SYRIANS OCCASIONALLY TELL US THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE 
TO CONTAIN THE LEBANESE SHI\'A \"WHEN THE NEED ARISES.\" 
HOWEVER, WE THINK THAT THEIR BOAST IS HOLLOW AND THAT 
THE SYRIANS WELL KNOW IT.  THEY HAVE MADE THE BEST OF THE 
SITUATION BY MILKING THE IRANIANS--KEEPING THAT 
RELATIONSHIP BOTH CORDIAL AND LUCRATIVE--WHILE ATTEMPTING 
TO BOLSTER BARRI.  THE FUTURE MUST BE WORRISOME. 
 
10.  THE REAL TEST OF WHETHER SYRIA CAN OR WILL ACT 
AGAINST IRAN/HIZBALLAH WILL COME IF IRAN\'S PROMISES OF 
CONTINUED OIL DELIVERIES PROVE FALSE.  EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, 
WE WOULD PREDICT THAT THE SYRIANS WILL MOVE IN A 
GINGERLY FASHION.  THE ULTIMATE PROSPECT IS OF A 
LEBANESE SHI\'A COMMUNITY ALIENATED FROM SYRIA AND, 
POSSIBLY, WITH IRANIAN SUPPORT ENERGIZED TO COMBAT SYRIA. 
IF SYRIA WENT TOO FAR IN ALIENATING IRAN/HIZBALLAH, IT 
MIGHT EVEN FACE AN ACTIVE IRANIAN/HIZBALLAH EMBRACE OF 
THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  THE MOST RADICAL (ALSO 
THE MOST DANGEROUS) ELEMENTS OF THE BROTHERHOOD ARE 
ANTAGONISTIC TO IRAN BECAUSE OF IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE 
HERETICAL ALAWI BA\'THI REGIME; IF THAT SUPPORT WERE 
REMOVED, THE NATURAL AFFINITY THAT IRAN HAS FOR THIS 
GROUP WOULD PRESUMABLY COME TO THE FORE.  THE PRECEDENT 
FOR FUNDAMENTALIST SUNNI-SHI\'A COOPERATION HAS ALREADY 
BEEN ESTABLISHED IN TRIPOLI. 
 
11.  IN ANY CASE, A STRONG SYRIAN MOVE AGAINST HIZBALLAH 
WOULD RUN AGAINST THE GRAIN OF SYRIAN POLICY IN LEBANON 
AS ESTABLISHED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.  AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR (1976-78) SYRIA INTERVENED 
DIRECTLY IN MAJOR FIGHTING, AT GREAT COST; SINCE THEN IT 
HAS PURSUED A LOW-COST POLICY, TRYING TO BALANCE PARTIES 
AGAINST EACH OTHER AND USING PROXIES IN LIMITED 
ENGAGEMENTS.  DESPITE PREDICTIONS TO THE CONTRARY AND 
DESPITE THE EMBARRASSING FAILURE OF THE TRIPARTITE ACCORD, 
THE SYRIANS HAVE BACKED OFF FROM ATTACKING THE MARONITES. 
THE PROSPECT OF A FULL-SCALE ATTACK AGAINST HIZBALLAH IS 
EVEN MORE REMOTE. 
 
12.  HOWEVER, LIMITED ENGAGEMENTS ARE BOUND TO CONTINUE. 
MASHGHARA IS A CASE IN POINT.  THE SYRIANS ARE ESPECIALLY 
NERVOUS ABOUT SOUTHERN LEBANON, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL 
THERE FOR ROUSING THE ISRAELIS.  THE SHI\'A OF SOUTHERN 
LEBANON HAVE ALSO, THUS FAR, BEEN THE LEAST RECEPTIVE TO 
HIZBALLAH.  WITH MASHGHARA THE SYRIANS MAY BE NERVOUSLY 
DRAWING A LINE WHICH THEY HOPE HIZBALLAH AND IRAN WILL 
ACCEPT, FOR THE TIME BEING. 
 
13.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  AS REFTELS POINT OUT, SYRIA APPEARS TO BE 
FACING A SUBSTANTIAL DEFEAT IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO QUICKLY 
AND RESOLUTELY RESOLVE THE LATEST ROUND IN THE \"WAR OF 
THE CAMPS\" IN LEBANON.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS 
LATEST ROUND OF FIGHTING ALREADY REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL 
FAILURE OF SYRIAN POLICY WHICH THREATENS TO ERODE 
DAMASCUS\' STRATEGY TOWARDS THE PALESTINIANS AND ITS 
EFFORTS TO SABOTAGE THE PALESTINIAN RECONCILIATION 
PROCESS NOW GOING ON.  FURTHER IT DAMAGES SYRIA\'S IMAGE 
WITHIN THE ARAB AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND 
INCREASINGLY CONTRIBUTES TO DISSENT WITHIN THE POLICY- 
MAKING PROCESS IN DAMASCUS ITSELF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  WE CONCUR WITH EMBASSY BEIRUT (REFTEL) THAT THE 
CONTINUED FIGHTING BETWEEN AMAL AND THE PALESTINIANS, IN 
WHICH AMAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SADLY DEFICIENT, 
REPRESENTS A MAJOR DILEMMA FOR SYRIAN POLICY-MAKERS. 
INDEED, WE WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY THAT THE FAILURE TO 
RESOLVE THE FIGHTING AT THIS POINT ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE 
TO AMAL AND THE SYRIANS ALREADY REPRESENTS A SEVERE 
SYRIAN DEFEAT AND THREATENS TO FURTHER UNRAVEL DAMASCUS\' 
ALREADY DISINTEGRATING PALESTINIAN POLICY. 
 
-- 
4.  A JORDANIAN JOURNALIST WITH EXCELLENT PALESTINIAN 
CONTACTS HAS TOLD US THAT IN THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS 
FOR A CEASEFIRE, THE PFLP -- THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE 
SYRIAN-BACKED PNSF WITH SUBSTANTIAL POPULAR SUPPORT AMONG 
THE PALESTINIANS -- HAS TAKEN A DECIDEDLY ANTI-SYRIAN 
LINE AND HAS SPLIT WITH THE MORE TRACTABLE PRO-SYRIAN 
ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE ABU MUSA FATAH GROUP, THE 
PFLP-GC, AND SAIQA.  ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, THE PFLP 
IS NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, THE DFLP, FATAH AND 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE CAMPS. 
SPECIFICALLY, THE PFLP NEGOTIATORS REFUSE TO TURN OVER 
TERRITORIES GAINED IN THE SIDON AREA TO ANYONE BUT 
MUSTAFA SA\'ID\'S POPULAR NASSARISTS MOVEMENT.  THE SCENARIO 
WE HAVE RECEIVED OF NEGOTIATIONS POSITS GREAT BITTERNESS 
BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AS A WHOLE ON THE ONE HAND AND 
NABIH BERRI AND THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER, AS 
WELL AS A GREAT DEAL OF BACK-BITING WITHIN BOTH THE 
PALESTINIAN AND LEBANESE GROUPINGS. 
 
5.  THE MILITARY FAILURE ON THE GROUND IN LEBANON IS NOT 
DAMASCUS\' ONLY DILEMMA.  AS IN PREVIOUS SYRIAN EFFORTS TO 
SUBJUGATE THE PALESTINIANS IN THE LEBANESE REFUGEE CAMPS 
THROUGH THE USE OF DAMASCUS\' AMAL SURROGATE, THE LATEST 
FIGHTING HAS CREATED GREAT BITTERNESS AMONG OTHER ARAB 
GOVERNMENTS.  DAMASCUS IS PRESENTLY OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN 
HOST TO A VARIETY OF SENIOR ARAB AND ISLAMIC ENVOYS -- 
ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER IBRAHIMI, LIBYA\'S MAJOR JALLUD, 
SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE NAIF, AND A NUMBER OF 
SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIALS.  WHILE JALLUD AND THE IRANIANS 
HAVE BECOME PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE PALESTINIAN/LEBAN- 
ESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH THE ALGERIAN 
AND THE SAUDI DELIVERED TOUGH MESSAGES TO ASAD REGARDING 
THIS LATEST ASSAULT ON THE PALESTINIANS.  THE SYRIANS MAY 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SOME SMALL COMFORT IN THE ANNOUNCE- 
MENT BY THE \"PAN-ARAB COMMAND\" CALLING FOR SOLIDARITY WITH 
SYRIA AGAINST THE AMERICAN, BRITISH AND ISRAELI 
CONSPIRACY AGAINST IT, SUPPORT FOR AMAL, AND A REDEFINI- 
TION OF THE PALESTINIAN ROLE IN LEBANON.  THIS 
ORGANIZATION IS, HOWEVER, ONE OF LITTLE STANDING AMONG 
THE ARAB STATES AS A WHOLE, TO SAY THE LEAST, AND IS 
LARGELY A SYRIAN-LIBYAN CREATURE.  INDEED, EVEN THIS MINOR 
\"VICTORY\" AND JALLUD\'S VERY CAREFUL STATEMENT OF 
MEASURED SUPPORT HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTED BY LIBYAN LEADER 
MO\'AMMAR QADHAFI\'S LATEST BLAST CONDEMNING AMAL. 
 
-- 
6.  AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, NOT ALL THE LEBANESE GATHERED 
HERE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF SYRIA EITHER.  WHILE NONE 
WANT TO SEE THE RECREATION OF THE PALESTINIAN \"STATE- 
WITHIN-A-STATE\" IN LEBANON, FEW ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH 
SYRIA THAT THIS TYPE OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE CAMPS 
IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE LEBANESE.  AS THEY SEE IT, 
LEBANESE MILITIAS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SYRIA\'S WORK FOR 
IT AND TO SHOULDER THE BLAME WITHIN THE ARAB COMMUNITY. 
DRUSE LEADER WALID JUMBLATT, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, FEELS 
PARTICULARLY SQUEEZED.  AMAL\'S SH\'IA RIVALS, HIZBALLAH, 
ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN NEGOTIATIONS, AND, AS IN THE 
PAST, HAVE REFRAINED FROM GETTING INVOLVED IN THE 
FIGHTING.  AT THE SAME TIME, HIZBALLAH\'S IRANIAN MENTORS 
ARE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE HERE.  OF INTEREST, PALESTINIANS 
TOLD OUR JORDANIAN SOURCE THAT SHAYKHOLESLAM EXPRESSED 
DEEP SYMPATHY FOR THE PALESTINIAN POSITION WHEN MEETING 
WITH PNSF LEADERS ON NOVEMBER 24.  ON THE EVENING OF 
NOVEMBER 27, HOWEVER, SHAYKHOLESLAM RETURNED TO THE 
PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP COLDLY BEARING BERRI\'S PROPOSALS. 
WE DO NOT, NEVERTHELESS, BELIEVE THAT IRAN\'S BASIC 
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE SYRIAN STRATEGY TOWARDS LEBANON 
HAS CHANGED IN ANY WAY.  THEY WANT TO TAKE ASAD\'S 
\"LEBANESE CARD\" AWAY FROM HIM. 
 
7.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE PNSF LEADERS BLINDLY LOYAL 
TO DAMASCUS DO NOT HAVE ANY REAL ABILITY TO DELIVER THE 
PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS IN THE TYRE, SIDON, OR BEIRUT 
CAMPS.  WHAT IS NOW AT STAKE FOR DAMASCUS IS NOT MERELY 
AN EMBARRASSMENT THROUGH A MILITARY DEFEAT FOR ITS 
LEBANESE SURROGATES.  RATHER, SYRIA IS FACED WITH BITTER 
DIVISIONS WITHIN ITS OWN UMBRELLA PALESTINIAN ORGANIZA- 
TION THAT COULD FINALLY TEAR IT APART, LEAVING A RUMP OF 
\"YES-MEN\" WITH NO BROAD PALESTINIAN POPULAR SUPPORT. 
SYRIA COULD LOSE ITS \"PALESTINIAN CARD.\" 
 
-- 
8.  THIS PARALLELS THE CURRENT STAGES OF THE PALESTINIAN 
RECONCILIATION EFFORT, WITH PFLP LEADER GEORGE HABASH 
NOW IN THE THIRD ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH FATAH 
NUMBER TWO MAN KHALIL AL-WAZIR IN ALGIERS.  ALTHOUGH 
HABASH CONTINUES TO HOLD OUT FOR HIS DEMANDS THAT 
INCLUDE PRIOR  ABROGATION OF THE AMMAN ACCORDS, 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADEN-ALGIERS AGREEMENTS, AND PLO 
BREAKING OFF ITS CONTACTS WITH EGYPT, THE FACT THAT THE 
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE IS DEEPLY DISTURBING TO DAMASCUS. 
KHALID FAHOUM HAS TOLD WESTERN DIPLOMATS THAT THE SYRIANS 
HAVE INFORMED THE DAMASCUS-BASED PALESTINIANS THAT ANY 
OF THEM ATTENDING AN ALGERIAN PNC WILL NOT BE PERMITTED 
TO RETURN TO SYRIA. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  THE CAMPS WAR REPRESENTS A MULTIFACETED, 
COMPLEX DILEMMA FOR DAMASCUS.  ITS IMPACT IS NOT MERELY 
ONE OF SYRIAN PRESTIGE AND SUPPORT OF ITS AMAL ALLY. 
IT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ASAD\'S PALESTINIAN 
POLICY, HIS IMAGE WITHIN THE ARAB WORLD, AND HIS PERSONAL 
RELATIONS WITH ARAB AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL - INCLUDING 
SOVIET - LEADERS.  CLOSER TO HOME, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE 
IS INTENSE INTERNAL DEBATE AMONG ASAD\'S LIEUTENANTS 
AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE CAMPS WAR AND LEBANON 
AS A WHOLE.  THUS FAR, ASAD DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A GRIP 
ON THE SITUATION.  THE LONGER THIS REMAINS THE CASE, THE 
MORE ROOM HIS LIEUTENANTS WILL HAVE TO MANEUVER AND TO 
INTRIGUE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.  SEVERAL KEY SYRIAN 
OFFICIALS, AMONG THEM VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM AND MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF ALI DUBA, HAVE GREAT PERSONAL 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE EVOLUTION OF SYRIA\'S LEBANESE AND 
PALESTINIAN POLICIES.  FAILURE IS NOT USUALLY PERMITTED 
BY DAMASCUS UNDER ASAD.  HOWEVER, AS WE LOOK AROUND HERE, 
FAILURE SEEMS TO BE BECOMING AN INCREASING PHENOMENA 
WITHIN SYRIAN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC POLICY.

SUBJECT:  CHANGES IN ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  AN AMERICAN JOURNALIST (STRICTLY PROTECT) WITH WELL- 
ESTABLISHED CONTACTS IN AMMAN AND DAMASCUS WITH DFLP AND 
PFLP PERSONALITIES HAS BEEN TOLD BY HIS PALESTINIAN 
SOURCES THAT THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS OFFERED TO 
MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN ITS ACTIVITIES.  THE OFFER 
WAS EXTENDED DURING THE TALKS WITH QADHAFI AND THE 
OTHER FIVE PALESTINIAN FACTIONS REPRESENTED AT THE 
RECENT TRIPOLI CONFERENCE.  IN ORDER TO GAIN PARTICIPA- 
TION AT THE UPCOMING ALGIERS PNC, ACCORDING TO PFLP AND 
DFLP SOURCES HERE, ANO NUMBER TWO ATIF ABU BAKR AGREED 
THAT HIS ORGANIZATION WOULD ADHERE IN THE FUTURE TO THE 
1979 PLO DECISION FORBIDDING ARMED ACTIONS OUTSIDE THE 
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
 
3.  THE DFLP AND PFLP OFFICIALS WHO PROVIDED THIS 
INFORMATION STATED THAT THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOMETIME A 
DEBATE GOING ON AMONG THE ANO LEADERSHIP AS TO ITS FUTURE 
COURSE OF ACTION.  THEY FEAR THAT THE SARG, BOTH BECAUSE 
OF WESTERN PRESSURES AND ITS OWN POLICIES, WILL INCREAS- 
INGLY RESTRICT ANO OPERATIONS BASED IN SYRIA AND LEBANON, 
AND THAT, IF EXPELLED FROM THESE SANCTUARIES, THEY WILL B 
HARD PRESSED TO FIND A SATISFACTORY BASE OF OPERATIONS. 
AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ADVOCATING A CHANGE IN STRATEGY 
HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE REPUTATION AMONG PALESTINIAN 
YOUTHS THAT THEY HAVE GAINED THROUGH TAKING ONE OF THE 
MOST ACTIVE ROLES IN THE DEFENSE OF THE PALESTINIAN 
CAMPS AGAINST THE AMAL MOVEMENT.  THIS GROUP, REPORTEDLY 
LED BY ATIF ABU BAKR, SUPPOSEDLY HAS DECIDED TO ADOPT 
A MORE MODERATE ROLE IN ORDER TO GAIN POLITICAL RESPECTA- 
BILITY AND REASSERT ITSELF DIRECTLY IN PALESTINIAN 
COUNCILS. 
 
4.  A SMALLER, DIE-HARD FACTION, HOWEVER, REMAINS 
COMMITTED TO AN ACTIVE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ROLE.  NO 
MATTER WHAT THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION DOES, IT WILL 
CONTINUE THEIR ACTIVITIES ALBEIT, PERHAPS, WITHOUT ALL OF 
THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE NOW TO THE ANO.  THE BOTTOM LINE 
IS, OF COURSE, THAT WE WILL STILL HAVE AN ANO EVEN IF IT 
OPERATES UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. 
 
5.  THE JOURNALIST SAYS THAT HIS PLFP CONTACTS INSIST 
THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CLOSED DOWN THE ABU NIDAL 
OFFICES IN DAMASCUS AND EXPELLED ITS OFFICIALS FROM SYRIA 
THE DFLP CONTACTS ON THE OTHER HAND SAY THAT THE ANO 
OFFICES ARE OPEN BUT THAT ABU NIDAL PERSONNEL ARE 
COMPLETELY RESTRICTED IN THEIR MOVEMENTS BY THE SYRIAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  ALL OF THE DAMASCUS PALESTINIANS 
AGREE THAT WITHIN THE CAMPS IN LEBANON AND SYRIA TODAY 
THE ANO ENJOYS PERHAPS GREATER PRESTIGE THAN ANY OTHER 
PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATION AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION -- 
WHAT THEY CALL THE SABRA/SHATILLA GENERATION.  ACCORDING 
TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE \"ONLY THE ANO IS DOING ANYTHING.\" 
THE JOURNALIST SAYS THAT THIS IS A FACT REFLECTED IN HIS 
OWN EXPERIENCES IN AMMAN WHERE THE CHILDREN OF HIS MIDDLE 
CLASS PALESTINIAN FRIENDS VOCIFERIOUSLY SUPPORT ABU NIDAL 
IN THE FACE OF THEIR MODERATE PARENTS. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  WHILE SOME OF THE LOGIC OF THE ARGUMENT 
THAT THE ANO MUST CHANGE ITS STRIPES OR RISK LOSING ITS 
SANCTUARIES MAKES SENSE, FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT 
THE ANO, WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ATIF ABU 
BAKR OR ANY OTHER LEADER IS WILLING TO ESCHEW 
TERRORISM AGAINST ARABS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND 
THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN 
OUR SOURCE, HOWEVER, AS HE IS AN ACCURATE AND EXPERIENCED 
REPORTER WITH VERY GOOD TIES IN PALESTINIAN CIRCLES 
AND CANNOT DISMISS HIS REPORT OUT OF HAND.  FURTHERMORE, 
ANO -  IF IT THOUGHT IT FACED A LOSS OF ITS SYRIAN BASE - 
MIGHT GO QUITE FAR TO KEEP ONE IN LIBYA AND ESTABLISH 
ITS PALESTINIAN CREDENTIALS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO 
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW UP.  END COMMENT. 
 
7.  DEPARTMENT SHOULD RETRANSMIT TO OTHER POSTS AS 
APPROPRIATE.

REF:  A) FBIS AMMAN JO 040709Z JUN 87 
--    B)  LINO/GREENE TELECON JUNE 4, 1987 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME -- BUT 
NOT YET CONCLUSIVE -- CONFIRMATION THAT THE SYRIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO END THE \"OFFICIAL\" ABU NIDAL 
PRESENCE IN SYRIA.  THE THREE OFFICES IN DAMASCUS APPEAR 
CLOSED.  WHILE THE SYRIAN JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ACTION 
MAY WELL BE ANGER OVER ABU NIDAL\'S DALLIANCE WITH ARAFAT 
IN ALGIERS, THE REAL REASONS SEEM TO BE ANO-SYRIAN 
CONFRONTATION IN LEBANON AND WESTERN PRESSURES.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  POST HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH SOME, BUT AS YET 
INCONCLUSIVE, CONFIRMATION OF \"JORDAN TIMES\" ARTICLE 
(REFTEL A) THAT SARG HAS FINALLY MOVED TO END THE 
ANO PRESENCE IN SYRIA.  DATT HAS SURVEYED THE THREE 
IDENTIFIED ABU NIDAL OFFICES IN DAMASCUS.  AS OF JUNE 4, 
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS OUTSIDE THE PRESS OFFICE AND THE ANO 
HEADQUARTERS IN DAMASCUS PROPER HAVE BEEN REMOVED (THESE 
CAMERAS HAD BEEN PRESENT JUNE 3).  THE GUARD FORCE 
NORMALLY PRESENT OUTSIDE BOTH LOCATIONS HAD ALSO BEEN 
MOVED AS OF JUNE 4, AND REGULAR SYRIAN POLICE CARS, 
NEVER PREVIOUSLY SEEN AT THE HEADQUARTERS LOCATION, WERE 
PARKED IN FRONT.  FOLLOW-UP SURVEY ON JUNE 5 FOUND THE 
OFFICES APPARENTLY DESERTED.  LOCAL AP CORRESPONDENT TOLD 
POLOFF JUNE 4 THAT HE HAD VISITED THE ANO HEADQUARTERS 
THAT MORNING AND FOUND THEM OCCUPIED BY \"ALI DUBA\'S 
MEN\" WHO WERE TEARING POSTERS OFF THE WALLS. 
 
4.  AP CORRESPONDENT INSISTS THE STORY IS TRUE, AND THAT 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ORDERED TO VACATE 
SYRIA COMPLETELY.  HE ASSERTS ALSO THAT THE TRAINING 
CAMPS IN THE BIQA\' HAVE BEEN CLOSED.  (THE SOURCE 
REMINDED US THAT HE HAD MADE THE LATTER CLAIM A WEEK 
AGO.)  PNSF CHAIRMAN KHALID AL-FAHOUM ALSO CONFIRMED THIS 
STORY TO THE ITALIAN COUNSELOR ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 4, 
AS DID A \"FORMER SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL\" TO A NUMBER OF 
OTHER WESTERN DIPLOMATS (WEST GERMAN CHARGE SAYS THE 
SOURCE WAS MOHAMMED SAKARIAN ISMAIL). 
 
5.  ON JUNE 4 AND 5, MISSION OFFICERS CALLED ON AUSTRIAN, 
BRITISH, DUTCH, FRENCH, GERMAN, CANADIAN, SPANISH, 
ITALIAN AND YUGOSLAV COLLEAGUES.  DATT CONTACTED HIS 
CHINESE AND AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPARTS.  THE AUSTRIANS, 
SPANISH, AND ITALIANS CLAIM TO HAVE SOME CONFIRMATION. 
ALL OUR CONTACTS PROMISED TO FOLLOW UP WITH LOCAL 
PALESTINIAN SOURCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND TO GET 
BACK TO US.  (ARAB EMBASSIES IN DAMASCUS WERE CLOSED 
FRIDAY, JUNE 5.  WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THEM OVER THE 
WEEKEND.) 
 
6.  COMMENT:  PHYSICALLY, THE ANO OFFICES APPEAR SHUT 
DOWN.  THEIR STATUS HAS GREATLY CHANGED FROM THE DATT\'S 
LAST RECONNAISSANCE.  THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN TELLING US, 
AS WELL AS THE REST OF OUR DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES, THAT ABU 
NIDAL\'S ORGANIZATION HAD LEFT SYRIA, WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF THE FRONT OFFICES WHICH WERE MANNED BY LOW LEVEL 
PERSONNEL, FOR SOME TIME.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE \"JORDAN 
TIMES\" STORY JUNE 4, MFA EUROPEAN DIRECTOR SULAYMAN HADDAD 
QUIPPED THAT \"THE AMERICANS SPEND MILLIONS ON THEIR CIA 
AND YET THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GRASP THE FACT 
THAT ABU NIDAL IS GONE.\"  FAHOUM AND DFLP AND PFLP 
LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN INSISTING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 
THE YEAR THAT, OTHER THAN THE TOKEN PRESENCE OF THE 
OFFICES, THAT THE ANO HAD LEFT SYRIA, FIRST FOR LEBANON 
AND THEN TO LIBYA. 
 
7.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  THE INFORMAL BUT OFFICIAL JUSTIFI 
CATION FOR THE FINAL SYMBOLIC GESTURE OF CLOSING THE 
OFFICES IS ABU NIDAL\'S DEALINGS WITH ARAFAT IN ALGIERS. 
ONE LOCAL SOURCE TELLS US THAT ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES 
MISREPRESENTED THE DISCUSSIONS TO THE SYRIANS FOLLOWING 
THEIR DEPARTURE FROM ALGIERS.  THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR 
POINTS OUT, HOWEVER (AND WE AGREE), THAT THE SAME 
JUSTIFICATION SHOULD APPLY MORE APPROPRIATELY TO THE 
DFLP, PFLP, PCP AND OTHERS WHO PARTICIPATED FULLY IN 
THE PNC.  MORE LIKELY, THE SYRIANS HAVE GROWN INCREASING- 
LY IRRITATED BY THE ANO\'S ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO SYRIAN 
EFFORTS TO END THE ARMED PALESTINIAN PRESENCE IN 
LEBANON AND THE SYRIAN MILITARY OCCUPATION OF WEST 
BEIRUT.  DAMASCUS, TOO, IS ANXIOUS TO RELIEVE WESTERN 
PRESSURE REGARDING TERRORISM AND MAY AT LAST  HAVE 
CONCLUDED THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF WHAT THEY INSIST IS A 
TOKEN POLITICAL PRESENCE IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE.

SUBJECT:  SYRIAN EXPULSION OF THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION 
 
REF:  A) DAMASCUS 3020, B) DAMASCUS 3026 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  EVERY SOURCE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW 
UP WITH CONCERNING ABU NIDAL\'S EXPULSION FROM SYRIA 
HAS CONFIRMED THE STORY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  NO ONE, 
HOWEVER, CAN SAY AUTHORITATIVELY THAT THE SYRIAN BAN ON 
THE ANO HAS EXTENDED TO THE CAMPS IN THE BIQA\' VALLEY. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  POST HAS DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW UP 
INITIAL REPORTS THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXPELLED 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION FROM ITS TERRITORY.  EVERY 
SOURCE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTACT IN THE PAST TWO DAYS 
HAS SAID THE SAME THING:  THE ANO IS GONE. 
 
4.  POLOFF SPOKE WITH LEBANESE BA\'TH PARTY LEADER QANSUH 
JUNE 7 WHO STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THE SYRIANS HAVE 
EXPELLED THE ANO.  QANSUH SAID QADHAFI HAD SENT A SENIOR 
EMISSARY TO GET THE EXPULSION ORDER REVERSED OR DELAYED, 
BUT ASAD HAD REJECTED THE APPEAL.  MICHEL SAMAHA TOLD 
POLOFF THE SAME DAY THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM MEETINGS 
WITH KHADDAM, SHARA\', AND KHOULI, ALL OF WHOM CONFIRMED 
THE ANO HAD BEEN OUSTED, ADDING THAT THIS WAS A POLITICAL 
DECISION TAKEN \"A MONTH AGO\" BUT EXECUTED AT A MOMENT 
(JUST BEFORE THE VENICE SUMMIT) TO MAXIMIZE ITS 
PROPAGANDA VALUE IN THE WEST. 
 
5.  AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE TALKED WITH PNSF 
CHAIRMAN KHALID AL-FAHOUM, PNSF INDEPENDENT SHAHABI, AND 
A MEMBER OF THE PFLP POLITBURO.  ALL THREE PALESTINIAN 
SOURCES TOLD THE AUSTRALIANS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THING: 
ABU NIDAL IS OUT.  THE ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE 
PALESTINIANS WAS THAT FAHOUM INDICATED THAT A FEW ANO 
MEMBERS REMAIN IN DAMASCUS TAKING CARE OF LAST MINUTE 
TRANSPORTATION DETAILS, BUT THAT THEY TOO WILL BE GONE BY 
FRIDAY, JUNE 15.  THE OTHER SOURCES SAID THOSE ANO MEMBERS 
NOT HOLDING SYRIAN DOCUMENTATION WERE ALREADY GONE. 
THE AUSTRALIANS\' PALESTINIAN CONTACTS ELABORATED ON THE 
QUESTION OF \"SYRIAN DOCUMENTATION.\"  THOSE ANO MEMBERS 
WHO HOLD THE PALESTINIAN IDENTITY DOCUMENTS NORMALLY 
ISSUED BY THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO PALESTINIANS ARE 
PERMITTED TO STAY.  THESE ARE BASICALLY REFUGEES WHO 
ARRIVED IN SYRIA IN 1948 AND THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN 
IN SYRIA.  PERMISSION TO STAY APPARENTLY DOES NOT EXTEND 
TO ANO MEMBERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED SYRIAN PASSPORTS IN THE 
COURSE OF THEIR ANO \"DUTIES.\"  THOSE ANO MEMBERS WHO DO 
REMAIN ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN ANO 
ACTIVITIES.  THEY WILL LIKELY BE CLOSELY WATCHED AND, IF 
ARRESTED FOR ANY VIOLATIONS, WILL BE TREATED AS ORDINARY 
SYRIAN CITIZENS.  THESE PALESTINIAN SOURCES, FINALLY, 
SUGGEST THE REASONS FOR THE SARG\'S DECISION RELATE TO THE 
DESIRE TO RELIEVE WESTERN PRESSURES REGARDING TERRORISM 
AS WELL AS REFLECT SYRIAN WRATH OVER ABU NIDAL\'S MEETING 
WITH FATAH LEADERS IN ALGIERS. 
 
6.  YUGOSLAV DCM REPORTED THAT TWO \"RESPONSIBLE\" 
PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS (WHOM HE OTHERWISE DECLINED TO 
IDENTIFY), HAVE ALSO INSISTED THE ANO HAS LEFT SYRIA. 
LIKE THE AUSTRALIANS\' SOURCES, THE YUGOSLAV\'S CONTACTS 
SAY THAT MOST HAVE GONE DIRECTLY TO LIBYA, WITH A FEW TO 
ALGIERS.  THE YUGOSLAV TOLD US THAT HIS SOURCES SAY THE 
REAL REASON FOR THE SARG\'S IMMEDIATE WRATH WAS THAT SYRIA 
INTELLIGENCE HAD \"CAUGHT\" ANO OPERATIVES \"SPYING\" ON 
SYRIA. 
 
7.  THE BRITISH EMBASSY HAS ALSO TOLD US THAT RELIABLE 
PALESTINIAN CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THE ANO\'S OUSTER AND 
DEPARTURE. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  EVERY SIGN HERE IS THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERN- 
MENT FINALLY HAS TAKEN THE \"DIFFICULT STEP\" TO ELIMINATE 
THE ANO PRESENCE IN DAMASCUS.  CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT 
MOTIVATION HAS BEEN THE DESIRE AND NEED TO ALLEVIATE 
WESTERN PRESSURES AND SANCTIONS.  SEVERAL SYRIAN AND 
LEBANESE CONTACTS HAVE ALL BUT PLEADED THAT AMERICA MUST 
NOW RESPOND TO ASAD\'S \"GESTURE\" BY RETURNING THE U.S. 
AMBASSADOR.  THE PALESTINIANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHILE 
ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF WESTERN PRESSURES, INSIST 
THAT DAMASCUS HAD COMPELLING REASONS OF ITS OWN FOR 
SHUTTING DOWN ABU NIDAL WHICH WILL STAND UP TO ARAB 
SCRUTINY.  THEY POINT OUT, TOO, THAT THE BULK OF THE ANO 
OPERATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN SHIFTED OUT OF SYRIA OVER 
THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO ESCAPE INCREASINGLY ONEROUS 
SYRIAN SUPERVISION AND RESTRICTIONS AND IN THE FACE OF 
SYRIA\'S UNRELENTING PRESSURE ON ALL THE PALESTINIANS, 
INCLUDING THE ANO, IN THE CAMPS\' WAR. 
 
9.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UP 
WITH CONFIRMABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN DECISION TO 
SEVER TIES WITH ABU NIDAL HAS EXTENDED TO THE TRAINING 
CAMPS IN THE SYRIAN OCCUPIED BIQA\' VALLEY.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, NO ONE SAYS THEY ARE STILL IN OPERATION EITHER. 
A \"SOMETIMES RELIABLE\" JOURNALIST INSISTS THAT THE BIQA\' 
CAMPS HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR SOME TIME, AND OFFERED TO 
ARRANGE FOR DAMASCUS POLOFF TO VISIT THE CAMPS WITH 
SYRIAN MILITARY ESCORT.  SAMAHA VENTURED WHAT HE ADMITTED 
WAS A GUESS THAT THEY HAD BEEN OR WOULD BE CLOSED.  NO 
ONE ELSE CLAIMS TO KNOW.  THE YUGOSLAV DCM HAS TOLD US 
THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO GET INFORMATION TO DATE FROM HIS 
PALESTINIAN CONTACTS, BUT WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD HAVE 
SOMETHING \"IN A WEEK OR SO.\"  POST WILL KEEP TRYING.

SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND NEWS OF A \"NEW AND GRAVE MOVE BY 
THE PKK\" 
 
REF:  STATE 208025 
 
1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  REFTEL IS DEAD RIGHT TO SEEK ALL THE 
INFORMATION WE CAN GET ON A PKK ATTACK ON U.S. FACILITIES 
IN TURKEY.  IF WE FIND SYRIA IS INVOLVED, WE SHOULD 
PROTEST HERE STRONGLY -- BARRING TURKISH OBJECTIONS TO 
SUCH A U.S. MOVE.  BUT WE SEE SYRIA AS LARGELY -- IF NOT 
ENTIRELY -- ABANDONING   TERRORISM FOR A VARIETY OF 
REASONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  PKK ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE ALLEGED IN THE TURKISH 
PRESS ACCOUNT MENTIONED IN REFTEL MUST BE PURSUED BUT WE 
NO LONGER REFLEXIVELY ASSUME THAT SYRIA PROMOTED OR 
CONDONED THE ATTACK.  THE PKK HAS NOT BEEN TOTALLY 
UPROOTED HERE LIKE ABU NIDAL, BUT IT HAS BEEN RESTRICTED. 
IT WON\'T BE COMPLETELY UPROOTED, IN OUR VIEW.  KURDS FORM 
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT MINORITIES OF SYRIA AND THE RULING 
ALAWIS  HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM -- AS TO MINORITY 
CHRISTIANS, DRUZE AND ISMAILIS -- TO FORM THE COALITION 
WHICH IS NEEDED TO OFFSET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SYRIANS, 
WHO ARE SUNNI ARABS, THE TRADITIONAL RULING CLASS.  KURDS 
ARE THE LEAST PROMINENT PART OF THE COALITION,  PARTLY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE SUNNI, AND ARE IN NO WAY IN A POSITION T 
ASSERT A RIGHT TO CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS WHICH COMPLICAT 
SYRIAN RELATIONS WITH A RESURGENT TURKEY. 
 
4.  WE CONTINUE TO DOUBT THAT SYRIA IS ENCOURAGING, RATHE 
THAN DISCOURAGING, ANY SUCH ATTACKS.  SYRIA HAS CLAMPED 
DOWN ON ASALA -- THE ARMENIAN BISHOP HERE SAYS IT HAS 
BEEN THROWN OUT -- AND HAS MOVED PKK CAMPS OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY.  THE REASONS ARE MANY:  BLOWN OPERATIONS, 
EUPHRATES WATER, A SKILLFUL TURKISH DIPLOMACY WHICH 
COMBINES THE CARROT WITH THE STICK.  OPERATIONS CONTINUE, 
BUT IRAQI AND IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR SUCH OPERATIONS -- TO 
EMBARRASS SYRIA AND EMBROIL IT WITH TURKEY -- REMAIN 
PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR US.  BUT WE MUST FOLLOW UP 
SUCH GOSSAMER  POSSIBILITIES AS REFTEL - BUT - ALTHOUGH WE 
HAVE A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN RAISING KURDISH TERRORISM 
AGAINST U.S. FACILITIES, THE TURKS WILL NOT RPT NOT 
WELCOME OUR DOING SO WITH SYRIANS IN THE CASE OF PKK. 
THE TURKS PROBABLY WILL WANT US NOT TO GET INVOLVED AT 
ALL, IN FACT -- EVEN IF IT IS PROVED THAT THE ALLEGED PKK 
ATTACKERS CAME FROM SYRIA. 
 
5.  UNDERGIRDING THIS NOW IS OUR FEELING THAT A BROAD 
AND DISPARATE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS -- WITH THE WEST, 
TURKEY, MODERATE ARABS, IRAQ, IRAN, AND THE DOMESTIC 
ECONOMY HAVE FORCED A TURN-AROUND HERE ON TERRORISM.  EVE 
SYRIA\'S MUCH PUBLICIZED SUPPORT FOR ITS OWN SUICIDE 
BOMBERS IN SOUTH LEBANON HAS ALL BUT HALTED IN THE PAST 
YEAR.  ASAD IS WEAK AND WANTS NO PROBLEMS WITH ISRAEL. 
WE DON\'T EXPECT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS TO BE 
DISCARDED ENTIRELY; AFTER ALL, SMALL SCALE, DENIABLE 
ATTACKS ARE THE WEAPON OF THE WEAK.  IN ADDITION, ASAD 
BELIEVES HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO SUPPORT \"NATIONAL 
RESISTANCE\" INSIDE ISRAELI-OCCUPIED TERRITORY AGAINST 
CERTAIN TARGETS.  (THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR US.  THE ISRAELI 
DEFINITION OF \"TERRORISM\" ON THE WEST BANK AND SOUTHERN 
LEBANON APPEARS DIFFERENT FROM OURS -- UNDERSTANDABLY, 
SINCE WE CHAMPION FOES OF OCCUPATION IN AFGHANISTAN, NIC- 
ARAGUA, ANGOLA, CAMBODIA, AND ELSEWHERE, WHILE THE 
ISRAELIS ARE OCCUPIERS WITH NO LARGE STAKE BEYOND THEIR 
BORDER.)  THUS, ASAD MAY TOSS MOST PALESTINIANS OUT OF 
DAMASCUS, BUT HE WILL HOLD OUT A REMNANT TO FRONT FOR 
HIS TOTTERING POLICY OF \"ARMED CONFRONTATION\" WITH ISRAEL 
HE SIMILARLY WANTS TO USE HIZBALLAHIS AGAINST ISRAEL\'S 
OCCUPATION AND WON\'T HESITATE, WE THINK, TO TAKE ON 
CERTAIN LEBANESE GROUPS WHICH PUSH HIM TOO FAR; THE 
LEBANESE ARE WEAKER THAN SYRIA, AND USE TERRORISM EVERY 
DAY THEMSELVES.  WITNESS KARAMI, AND MANY OTHERS OF EVERY 
CONFESSION.  ANYWAY, SYRIA ISN\'T OUT OF THE TERRORISM 
BUSINESS. 
 
6.  ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHETHER ASAD HAS REDUCED 
TERRORISM AS MUCH AS WE THINK.  \"YOU WON\'T BELIEVE ME,\" 
SHRUGGED ASAD, AFTER TELLING ONE AMERICAN VISITOR THAT 
THERE WOULD BE NO TERRORIST OPERATION RUN OUT OF 
SYRIA IN THE FUTURE, \"BUT IT IS USEFUL TO SAY SO, TO 
CLOSE THE DOSSIER.\"  WE MUST BE ALERT TO EVERY 
INCIDENT--BUT NOT IGNORE THE SIGNS OF A BASIC CHANGE.

SUBJECT:  A SYRIAN DIPLOMAT\'S VIEW OF LIFE IN TEHRAN 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  SOME SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS OF 
LIFE IN THE IRANIAN CAPITAL FROM A SYRIAN DIPLOMAT 
PAINT A GLOOMY PICTURE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  MR. HUSNI DIAB IS THE RECENTLY RETURNED SYRIAN 
COMMERCIAL COUNSELOR IN TEHRAN (RETURNED TO 
DAMASCUS MARCH 14).  HE IS A SUNNI DAMASCENE OF 
GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS SPENT THE BULK OF HIS CAREER 
IN THE BANKING SECTOR, FIRST WORKING FOR PRIVATE 
BANKS IN DAMASCUS, THEN FOR THE COMMERCIAL BANK 
OF SYRIA AFTER THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKING 
SECTOR IN THE 1960S.  PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR HIS 
MISSION IN TEHRAN, HE SPENT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AT 
THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FOREIGN TRADE, WORKING 
WITH HIS OLD MENTOR AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, MINISTER 
OF ECONOMY AND FOREIGN TRADE, MOHAMMED IMADI 
(WHO WAS ALSO MINISTER OF ECONOMY IN THE LATE 
1970S).  MR. DIAB HAS SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
IN TEHRAN.  HE IS ALSO A FORMER AID GRANTEE WHO 
TRAINED WITH U.S. BANKS IN THE EARLY 1960S. 
 
-   -------------------- 
4.  LIFE UNDER THE SCUDS 
-   -------------------- 
 
IN A TYPICAL, FATALISTIC WAY, DIAB SAID THAT DURING 
THE RECENT PERIOD OF MISSILE ATTACKS HE PUT HIM- 
SELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH A VALIUM.  HE WENT ON 
TO SAY THAT IT WAS NOT SO BAD DURING THE DAY WHEN 
THE NOISE OF THE CITY WOULD DROWN OUT THE SOUND 
OF DISTANT MISSILES FALLING.  BUT IN THE QUIET OF 
THE NIGHT, THE SOUND WAS ALL TOO CLEAR.  DIAB 
ESTIMATED THAT OF A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 
10 MILLION, ABOUT 30 PERCENT VACATED THE CITY AT 
NIGHT.  \"THE WEALTHIER TEHRANIS GO AND STAY IN 
THEIR SUMMER HOUSES OR WITH RELATIVES IN THE OUT- 
LYING VILLAGES AND COUNTRYSIDE.  ANYONE WITH A 
CAR WILL DRIVE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND SLEEP IN 
THE CAR OR CAMP.\" 
 
-   ----------------- 
5.  IRANIAN OFFICIALS 
-   ----------------- 
 
DIAB SAID THAT THE TOP LEVEL IRANIAN OFFICIALS HE 
DEALT  WITH WERE INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED.  MID- 
LEVEL OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BUSINESS AND 
ECONOMIC SECTORS, HAD OVERWHELMINGLY BEEN TRAINED 
IN THE U.S.  HE ADDED THAT HE FREQUENTLY PASSED 
THE U.S. EMBASSY BUILDING ON HIS WAY TO AN ADJACENT 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUILDING.  HE SAID THE PREMISES 
ARE STILL MANNED BY REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS BUT NOT 
USED.  DIAB\'S COMMENTS ON THE IRANIAN BUREAUCRACY 
WERE SCATHING.  \"A SINGLE, SIMPLE TRANSACTION 
CAN TAKE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE.  TO 
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING REQUIRES AT LEAST THREE OR 
FOUR SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS.  THE IRANIAN BUREAUC- 
RACY IS A NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH.\"  CONSIDERING 
THAT THE SYRIAN BUREAUCRACY\'S PACE IS CLOSER TO 
THE TORTOISE THAN THE HARE, THIS IS STRONG LANGUAGE 
INDEED. 
 
-   ------------------------- 
6.  IRANIAN TOURISTS IN SYRIA 
-   ------------------------- 
 
DIAB AGREED THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT PAYS 
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT $250 PER TOURIST FOR A ONE 
WEEK TRIP TO SYRIA, INCLUDING FOOD AND TRANSPOR- 
TATION.  HE SAID THE ARRANGEMENT IS FOR TWO 
THOUSAND TOURISTS PER WEEK.  HE DENIED THAT 
FAMILIES OF MARTYRS ARE PROVIDED THIS TRIP AS A 
FREE BONUS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, HE SAID 
THAT UNDER BLACK MARKET RATES FOR THE IRANIAN 
CURRENCY THE AVERAGE IRANIAN PAYS APPROXIMATELY 
$80 FOR THE TOUR.  HE SAID FOR THE MOST PART THE 
TRAVELERS ARE POOR VILLAGERS AND/OR RELIGIOUS 
ADHERENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN VISITING DAMASCUS\' 
MOSQUES AND SHRINES.  THE WEALTHIER IRANIANS, HE 
ADDED, PARTICULARLY NOW DURING THE ANNUAL FEAST 
OF NAWRUZ, ARE TRAVELING TO EUROPE, CANADA AND 
THE U.S. 
 
-   -------------- 
7.  FUNDAMENTALISM 
-   -------------- 
 
DIAB WAXED PHILOSOPHICAL REGARDING THE CAUSES OF 
FUNDAMENTALISM IN IRAN.  ESSENTIALLY, IT BOILED 
DOWN TO AN OPINION THAT THE SHAH IGNORED THE 
GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE SMALL WEALTHY ELITE AND 
THE GREAT MASS OF POOR.  THE SHAH SHOULD HAVE 
DEVOTED MORE TIME AND MONEY TO PROVIDING ROADS, 
ELECTRICITY, CLEAN WATER AND EDUCATION TO THE 
MASSES AND NOT TO BEAUTIFYING EXCLUSIVE PARTS OF 
TEHRAN AND OTHER CITIES.  THE POOR REACTED BY 
TURNING TO RELIGION AND THE REVOLUTION WAS BORN. 
NOW, EVEN FOR A FRIENDLY SYRIAN DIPLOMAT, LIFE 
IS DIFFICULT.  THE BUREAUCRACY IS SLOW AND 
STUPID.  THE ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE AND THERE ARE 
SHORTAGES OF ALL KINDS.  LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, 
THE SCUDS ARE FALLING. 
 
8.  WHEN DIAB RECEIVED WORD OF HIS REASSIGNMENT 
HOME, HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE EMBASSY CAME BY TO 
CONGRATULATE HIM.  EVEN THE BENEFITS OF LIVING 
ABROAD ON A DOLLAR SALARY, APPARENTLY, DO NOT 
COMPENSATE FOR THE HARDSHIPS OF LIVING IN TEHRAN. 
 
9.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.  EAGLETON

2.  ROLF GAUFFIN, SWEDEN\'S AMBASSADOR IN DAMASCUS, 
TOLD DCM RECENTLY THAT AN ARAB NATIVE WITH A CLAIM 
TO SWEDISH PERMANENT RESIDENCY HAD WALKED INTO THE 
SWEDISH EMBASSY IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS TO SEEK REPATRI- 
ATION.  THE PERSON SAID HE HAD BEEN IN TRAINING AT THE 
PKK CAMP IN THE BIQA BUT HAD BECOME DISAFFECTED AND 
WANTED TO RETURN TO SWEDEN.  GAUFFIN IS ARRANGING FOR 
HIS DEPARTURE. 
 
3.  GAUFFIN SAID HE WAS APPREHENSIVE OF THE SYRIAN 
REACTION TO HIS HANDLING SUCH A CASE, ESPECIALLY WITH 
THE PKK CONNECTION.  HE, THEREFORE, ALERTED THE 
POLITICAL SECURITY DIVISION TO ASSURE THEY KNEW THE 
WHOLE STORY.  THE PSD REPLY LED GAUFFIN TO BELIEVE 
THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF HIS \"WALK-IN\" AND HAD NO 
INTENTION OF INTERFERING.  THIS EPISODE ALSO CONFIRMED 
FOR GAUFFIN THAT THE SYRIANS DO KEEP TABS ON COMINGS 
AND GOINGS IN THE BIQA. 
 
4.  IN VIEW OF HIS RECENT EXPOSURE TO THE PKK AND 
SYRIAN COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE 
INTERESTED IN CONTACTING THE GOS TO SEE IF A DEBRIEF- 
ING WITH THE EX PKK TRAINEE MIGHT BE ARRANGED.

1.  (C)  DAMASCUS HAS ADOPTED A LOW PUBLIC PROFILE ON 
THE AMAL-HIZBALLAH FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM AL TUFFAH, 
DESPITE ITS INTENSITY AND POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES.  SYRIAN 
MEDIA HAS GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE BATTLES AND THE 
SARG APPEARS TO BE TAKING FEW, IF ANY, STEPS TO TRY TO 
END IT.  THE FLURRY OF PUBLIC DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN 
DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN, WHICH FOLLOWED PREVIOUS CLASHES 
BETWEEN THE TWO SHIA\' MILITIAS HAS NOT OCCURRED.  UNLIKE 
ITS IRANIAN COUNTERPARTS, THE SARG HAS NOT CALLED FOR A 
CEASE-FIRE AMONG THE COMBATANTS.  DAMASCUS IS SUPPORTING 
THE INTERVENTION OF THE LEBANESE ARMY INTO THE AREA, BUT 
PROBABLY ALSO REALIZES THE LAF CAN DO LITTLE TO STOP THE 
FIGHTING WITHOUT THE ACQUIESCENCE OF BOTH AMAL AND 
HIZBALLAH.  INTERESTINGLY, AN ARTICLE IN AN NAHAR, AN 
INDEPENDENT WEST BEIRUT NEWSPAPER, PORTRAYED THE FIGHTING 
AS AN \"UNDECLARED WAR\" BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN. 
 
--------------------- 
DAMASCUS UNCONCERNED? 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  DAMASCUS HAS PAID LITTLE PUBLIC ATTENTION IN THE 
MEDIA TO THE FIGHTING THUS FAR, FOCUSING INSTEAD ON THE 
HRAWI GOVERNMENT\'S JULY 11 PLAN TO IMPLEMENT TA\'IF.  THE 
SARG HAS TAKEN NO STEPS AIMED AT HALTING THE FIGHTING. 
EVEN THOUGH, THE FIGHTING IS IN AN AREA OF LEBANON WHERE 
THERE IS NO CONCENTRATION OF SYRIAN TROOPS, DAMASCUS AND 
TEHRAN HAVE BROKERED CEASE-FIRES BETWEEN AMAL AND 
HIZBALLAH PREVIOUSLY.  DAMASCUS PROBABLY DOES PERCEIVE AN 
INTEREST IN STEMMING HIZBALLAH\'S ROLE AND ANY GROWTH IN 
INFLUENCE AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHTING.  IRANIAN FORMIN 
VELAYATI CLAIMED IN HIS LETTER TO LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER 
HUSS (REF A) THAT IRAN HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS CONTACT AND 
CONSULTATION WITH THE SARG, BUT EMBASSY DAMASCUS HAS 
NOTED A LACK OF PUBLIC DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY.  WE HAVE 
DETECTED NO SHUTTLING OF IRANIAN OR SYRIAN DIPLOMATS 
BETWEEN THE CAPITALS OR INTO LEBANON TO TALK WITH AMAL 
AND HIZBALLAH OFFICIALS. 
 
3.  (S)  EMBASSY HAS ALSO DETECTED NO ATTEMPT BY THE SARG 
TO STOP THE FLOW OF ARMS TO THE COMBATANTS.  PRESS 
ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT SOME OF DAMASCUS\' OTHER LEBANESE 
SURROGATES, SUCH AS ELIE HUBAYQA, ARE ASSISTING AMAL, 
WHICH PROBABLY INCLUDES SUPPLYING ARMS.  IF THE SYRIANS 
CAN PREVENT THEIR PROXIES FROM SUPPLYING GENERAL AWN AT A 
MOMENT\'S NOTICE (REF D), THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY COULD 
EXERT THE SAME INFLUENCE ON THEIR PROXIES WHO ARE 
SUPPLYING AMAL. 
 
4.  (S)  DAMASCUS IS ALSO VOID OF ANY RUMORS HINTING THAT 
THE SYRIANS MAY HAVE CLOSED THE BORDER TO LEBANON TO SHUT 
DOWN THE THE IRANIAN PIPELINE TO HIZBALLAH OR STOPPED THE 
FLOW OF ARMS FROM THE BIQA\' TO THE SOUTH.  CONTROL OF 
THESE PIPELINES ARE THE SARG\'S PRINCIPAL LEVERAGE OVER 
THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND HIZBALLAH AND ONE 
THEY HAVE USED DURING PREVIOUS CLASHES BETWEEN AMAL AND 
HIZBALLAH.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, DAMASCUS SHUT THE LEBANESE 
BORDER TO THE IRANIANS IN PART TO PROTEST IRAN\'S 
SUPPLYING OF ARMS TO HIZBALLAH.  WHEN THE SARG REOPENED 
IT, IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND THEIR SUPPLIES 
ENTERED LEBANON UNDER TIGHTER CONTROLS (REF B).  UNDER 
THESE CONDITIONS, THE SYRIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT IS 
CROSSING THE BORDER INTO LEBANON.  (COMMENT:  BECAUSE OF 
ITS CONTROL OVER THE PIPELINE, THE SARG MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
CAUGHT TOTALLY OFF GUARD BY THE OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING 
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, REALIZING THAT HIZBALLAH HAD BEEN 
RESUPPLIED.) 
 
5.  (C)  THE SARG HAS ALSO ALLOWED ITS ALLY, AMAL LEADER 
NABIH BERRI TO PUBLICLY CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF IRANIAN 
FORCES FROM LEBANON.  BERRI HAS MADE SEVERAL STATEMENTS 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS REITERATING THIS POINT 
WITH LITTLE DETECTABLE REACTION FROM THE SARG.  AMAL 
OFFICIALS HAVE ACCUSED IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS OF 
PARTICIPATING IN THE FIGHTING AND HAVE EVEN BLAMED THEM 
FOR ESCALATING IT (REF C). 
 
---------------------- 
WHAT DAMASCUS HAS DONE 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  THE SARG HAS ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE 
INTERVENTION OF THE LEBANESE ARMY (LAF) INTO THE IQLIM AL 
TUFFAH IN ORDER TO HALT THE FIGHTING (REF F).  LEBANESE 
ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL LAHUD WAS IN DAMASCUS OVER THE 
WEEKEND MEETING WITH GENERAL SHIHABI, ACCORDING TO 
LEBANESE PRESS REPORTS (REF G).  THE PLAN TO INTERVENE IN 
THE IQLIM FIGHTING PROBABLY WAS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE LAF HAS FEW TROOPS AND WOULD BE HARD 
PRESSED TO GET INVOLVED BOTH IN THE IQLIM AND AID IN THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JULY 11 PLAN IN BEIRUT. 
 
------------------- 
AN \"UNDECLARED WAR\" 
------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  AN NAHAR, AN INDEPENDENT WEST BEIRUT NEWSPAPER, 
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ON JULY 25 ENTITLED \"THE IQLIM AL 
TUFFAH WAR IS BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN\" (REF E).  THE 
ARTICLE QUOTED SOURCES CLOSE TO DAMASCUS AS SAYING \"THE 
FIGHTING...BETWEEN \'HIZBALLAH\' AND \'THE AMAL MOVEMENT\' IN 
IQLIM AL TUFFAH...IS ACTUALLY AN UNDECLARED WAR BETWEEN 
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN AND SYRIA.\"  THE SYRIAN 
SOURCES BASED THIS CLAIM ON THREE FACTORS: 
 
-- THE FAILURE OF AN INDIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN IRAN AND 
THE U.S., WHICH HAD BEEN BROKERED BY SYRIAN FORMIN 
SHARA\', EARLIER THIS YEAR; 
 
-- IRAN\'S FEARS OF THE INCREASING PROSPECTS FOR ARAB 
RECONCILIATION; AND 
 
-- HIZBALLAH AND IRAN\'S FEARS THAT THEY WILL BE LEFT OUT 
OF THE PLANNING FOR LEBANON\'S FUTURE. 
 
8.  (C)  THE ARTICLE ALSO PRESENTS THE IRANIAN VIEWS ON 
WHAT LED TO THE ABOVE PROBLEMS.  THE IRANIAN SOURCES 
BELIEVE THE SYRIAN SPONSORED US-IRANIAN AGREEMENT FAILED 
BECAUSE OF \"DAMASCUS\' CONNIVANCE WITH WASHINGTON\" AND 
DAMASCUS \'S FALLING INTO THE U.S. TRAP AND ITS (DAMASCUS) 
IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT \"U.S. POLICY TOWARD THE 
IRANIAN ISLAMIC REVOLUTION...HAS NOT CHANGED.\"  SYRIA\'S 
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH EGYPT AND THE NEVERENDING ATTEMPTS TO 
RECONCILE SYRIA AND IRAQ TRIGGERED THE SECOND IRANIAN 
FEAR.  THE JULY 11 PLAN\'S EXCLUSION OF THE SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS UNTIL \"ALL OBSTACLES, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH 
ARE THE FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS, ARE OVERCOME\" 
HEIGHTENED THE LAST IRANIAN CONCERN. 
 
9.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, IT WAS THE IRANIAN 
FUNDAMENTALIST ANALYSIS OF THE SYRIAN STAND CONCERNING 
LEBANON THAT \"PROMPTED THEM (IRAN AND HIZBALLAH) TO 
ESCALATE THE WAR IN THE IQLIM AL -TUFFAH WHERE SYRIA HAS 
NO DIRECT PRESENCE AND WHERE ITS ALLIES CAN NOT STAND 
ALONE AND ... WIN.\"  THE ARTICLE STATES THE AIM OF THE 
FIGHTING IS TO SEIZE CONTROL OF TERRITORY AND MAKE IRAN 
AND ITS ALLIES HEARD IN LEBANON AND THE REGION. 
(COMMENT:  LEBANESE PRESS HAS REPORTED THAT DAMASCUS HAS 
ASKED THE TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE HIZBALLAH IN 
THE EXPANDED LEBANESE CABINET.  THE SARG DID SPECIFY, 
HOWEVER, THAT HIZBALLAH MUST FIRST ACCEPT TA\'IF.  IN 
OTHER WORDS, SARG IS DEMANDING THAT HIZBALLAH AND GENERAL 
AWN LIVE UP TO THE SAME CONDITIONS -- AN UNLIKELY 
EVENT.)  (REF I) 
 
10.  (C)  DAMASCUS PROBABLY WILL MAINTAIN ITS PUBLIC 
AMBIVALENCE TOWARDS THE FIGHTING AS LONG AS AMAL HOLDS 
ITS OWN AGAINST HIZBALLAH, WHICH RECENT IRANIAN AND     . 
HIZBALLAH CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE SEEM TO INDICATE.  THE 
SARG CAN HIDE ITS INACTION BEHIND THE JUSTIFICATION THAT 
IT HAS NO TROOPS IN THE AREA TO INTERVENE. 
 
- 
11.  (C)  THE CURRENT WILDCARD IS THE POTENTIAL ISRAELI 
REACTION TO THE CONTINUED FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM.  SO FAR, 
NEITHER THE SARG OR THE SYRIAN MEDIA HAS MADE AN ISSUE OF 
RECENT ISRAELI STATEMENTS THREATENING POSSIBLE 
INTERVENTION SHOULD THE FIGHTING THREATEN ISRAEL\'S 
SECURITY (REF H).  THE ISRAELIS MAY BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT 
THE PLO\'S PRESENCE AND ACTIVITIES IN SOUTHERN LEBANON IN 
THIS REGARD. 
 
12.  (C)  THE AN NAHAR ARTICLE NO DOUBT GOES TO FAR IN 
CASTING THE FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM AS ENTIRELY A \"WAR\" 
BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN BUT TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO 
SPONSORS PROBABLY ARE A FACTOR.  THE ARTICLE DOES 
CORRECTLY HIGHLIGHT MANY OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAVE 
CAUSED STRAINS BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN.    THE TWO 
COUNTRIES ULTIMATELY ARE AT ODDS IN THEIR VISION FOR 
LEBANON\'S FUTURE.

             NEW AMAL-HIZBALLAH AGREEMENT 
 
REF:    DAMASCUS 7165 
 
1.  (U)  AN IRANIAN DELEGATION LED BY IRANIAN VICE 
PRESIDENT DR. HASAN HABIBI MET SYRIAN COUNTERPARTS IN 
DAMASCUS NOVEMBER 3-5 WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SUPREME 
SYRIAN-IRANIAN COUNCIL TO DISCUSS A FULL RANGE OF 
BILATERAL AND REGIONAL SUBJECTS.  ACCOMPANYING HABIBI 
WERE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI, HIS ASSISTANT 
GHOLAM REZA SAN\'ATI, DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST SECTION 
OF THE IRANIAN MFA MAHMUD HASHEMI-RAFSANJANI, ASSISTANT 
DEFENSE MINISTER MUHAMMAD VAHIDI, ADVISER TO THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER AHMAD FAS MALIJIAN, AND CHIEF OF PROTOCOL FOR 
THE VICE PRESIDENT MUHAMMAD HOSEYN DANYAL. 
 
------------------------------- 
AMAL-HIZBALLAH AGREEMENT SIGNED 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  THE SYRIAN MEDIA ON 5 NOVEMBER ANNOUNCED 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEBANESE SHIA AMAL AND HIZBALLAH 
MOVEMENTS FOLLOWING TALKS AT THE SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY 
WHICH REPORTEDLY BEGAN THE EVENING OF 4 NOVEMBER.  THE 
ACCORD WAS SIGNED BY AMAL LEADER NABIH BERRI AND 
HIZBALLAH SECRETARY GENERAL SUBHI AL-TUFAYLI \"UNDER THE 
AUSPICES\" OF THE IRANIAN AND SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTERS AND 
IN THE PRESENCE OF SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF IN 
LEBANON, BRIGADIER GENERAL GHAZI KANAAN.  ACCORDING TO 
THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT: 
 
--  THE TWO SIDES WILL HELP FACILITATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF 
THE LEBANESE ARMY IN SOUTHERN LEBANON \"IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS ABILITY TO ENFORCE LAW AND ORDER.\" 
 
--  ANY DISAGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AGREEMENT 
MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH REFERENCE TO THE SYRIAN AND 
IRANIAN PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO THEIR INTERPRETATION. 
 
--  ALL PERSONS EVACUATED AS A RESULT OF AMAL- 
HIZBALLAH FIGHTING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR 
\"AREAS, VILLAGES, AND HOMES.\" 
 
--  A COMMITTEE WILL BE FORMED, \"COMPRISING BRIGADIER. 
GENERAL. GHAZI KANAAN AND (IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA) 
AKHTARI,\" TO SUPERVISE AND FOLLOW UP IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE AGREEMENT. 
 
--  FURTHER TO THE APPENDIX TO THE DAMASCUS AGREE- 
MENT (JANUARY 30, 1989), AND IN CASE EITHER PARTY 
VIOLAQTHE AGREEMENT, THE \"INJURED PARTY\" MUST 
INFORM THE COMMITTEE, WHICH WILL THEN CONVENE 
IMMEDIATELY TO \"TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION TO DETER 
THE VIOLATOR WITHIN A MAXIMUM PERIOD OF 24 HOURS. 
IN CASE OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, THE ACCUSED WILL BE 
HANDED OVER TO THE CONCERNED AUTHORITIES.\" 
 
--  THE AGREEMENT WILL TAKE EFFECT AS OF 10 NOVEMBER 
1990. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
NO OTHER CONCRETE ACHIEVEMENTS NOTED, YET 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  BEYOND MENTIONING HABIBI\'S DESCRIPTION OF 
HIS TALKS AS \"SUCCESSFUL AND FRUITFUL\" ON HIS RETURN 
TO TEHRAN NOVEMBER 6, THE SYRIAN MEDIA HAS NOT 
PROVIDED DETAILS OF ANY SUBSTANTIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
TOWARD THE STATED GOAL OF \"CHARTING A PLAN OF ACTION\" 
TO DEVELOP BILATERAL RELATIONS \"IN ALL FIELDS.\"  BOTH 
SIDES AGREED TO FORM SUBCOMMITTEES TO FOLLOW UP THE 
SYRIAN-IRANIAN JOINT COMMITTEE\'S THREE SESSIONS ON 
BILATERAL COOPERATION.  HABIBI MET WITH SYRIAN 
PRESIDENT ASAD (IN LATAKIA) ON NOVEMBER 4, AS WELL AS 
WITH VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM.  OTHER MEETINGS BETWEEN 
IRANIAN AND SYRIAN OFFICIALS DEALT WITH LEBANON AND 
OTHER \"REGIONAL AND BILATERAL ISSUES,\" ACCORDING TO 
THE LIMITED MEDIA REPORTING. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
EXCHANGE OF POSITIONS ON THE GULF CRISIS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  WHILE SYRIA CONSIDERS ITS SUCCESS ENSURING 
IRANIAN COMPLIANCE WITH UN SANCTIONS ON IRAQ TO HAVE 
BEEN THE SUPREME ACCOMPLISHMENT OF ASAD\'S SEPTEMBER 
VISIT TO IRAN, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES 
ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES APPARENTLY 
CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE.  ALTHOUGH SYRIAN MEDIA HAVE 
BEEN LARGELY SILENT ON GULF-BELATED ISSUES (SEE 
SEPTEL ON INFORMATION MINISTER SALMAN\'S RECENT 
REAFFIRMATION THAT SYRIA DEMANDS IRAQ\'S FULL AND 
UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT), WE NOTE THAT 
IRANIAN MEDIA CITED HABIBI\'S NOVEMBER 4 STATEMENT 
THAT \"ALLIED FORCES MUST WITHDRAW FROM THE REGION\" 
AND THAT KHADDAM SAID IN RESPONSE THAT \"THE PERMANENT 
PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES HAS NOT TOLERABLE.\"  THE 
TWO SIDES ALSO RECONFIRMED THEIR REJECTION OF ANY 
GEOGRAPHICAL CHANGES IN THE REGION AND THEIR SUPPORT 
FOR COLLECTIVE REGIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION.  SYRIAN 
PRESS ON NOVEMBER 7 QUOTED HABIBI\'S ARRIVAL STATEMENT 
AFFIRMING SYRIA\'S AND IRAN\'S CONDEMNATION OF IRAQ\'S 
INVASION OF KUWAIT AND THE TWO GOVERNMENTS\' CALL FOR 
IRAQ\'S UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  THIS LATEST AGREEMENT TO END THE OFTEN 
BLOODY INTRA-SHIA FEUDING IN LEBANON WILL LIKELY BE 
THE PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS VISIT.  UPON HIS 
RETURN TO TEHRAN, HABIBI LAUDED THE AGREEMENT AS AN 
ACHIEVEMENT WHICH WILL ENABLE \"THE MOBILIZATION OF 
ALL CAPABILITIES TO CONFRONT THE ZIONIST ENEMY.\" 
HIZBALLAH LEADER AL-TUFAYLI ECHOED THIS SENTIMENT 
WHILE AMAL LEADER BERRI, BY CONTRAST, MERELY VOICED 
THE HOPE THAT AMAL AND HIZBALLAH MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE 
TO \"RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND VILLAGES.\" 
 
6.  (C)  THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT 
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE VISIT MAY REFLECT DISAGREEMENTS 
OVER THORNY BILATERAL MATTERS LIKE ECONOMIC 
ASSISTANCE.  OUR COLLEAGUES TELL US THAT ASAD DID NOT 
OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE TO CONTINUED OR INCREASED 
ECONOMIC AID TO SYRIA BY CERTAIN HARDLINE IRANIAN 
CLERICS, BECAUSE OF SYRIA\'S 5.5 BILLION USD DEBT, 
DURING ASAD\'S VISIT TO TEHRAN.  AS A RESULT, NO 
CONCRETE TRADE AGREEMENTS WERE SIGNED, ALTHOUGH SYRIA 
IS STILL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONTINUED IRANIAN 
WILLINGNESS TO SELL IT OIL AT BELOW-MARKET RATES. 
WHETHER THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE, IT DOES NOT APPEAR 
FROM THE COMPOSITION OF THE IRANIAN DELEGATION OR THE 
MODEST SYRIAN MEDIA COVERAGE THAT THIS FIRST 
GATHERING OF THE SYRIAN-IRANIAN SUPREME COUNCIL WILL 
RESULT IN HIGHER IRANIAN AID LEVELS FOR SYRIA.

E.O. 12356:  N/A 
TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, PINS, SY 
SUBJECT:  ASAD GRANTS AMNESTY FOR 540 POLITICAL PRISONERS 
 
1.  SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASAD HAS ISSUED A DECREE GRANTING 
AN AMNESTY TO 540 PRISONERS HELD ON \"SECURITY\" GROUNDS, 
ACCORDING TO THE MAIN NEWS BULLETIN ON GOVERNMENT- 
CONTROLLED DAMASCUS RADIO AT 1415 LOCAL TIME, DECEMBER 
1.  THE BRIEF BULLETIN DID NOT ELABORATE ON THE 
IDENTITIES OF THE PRISONERS, THE NATURE OF THEIR 
OFFENSES, OR THE OCCASION FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION. 
 
2.  IN A RELATED MATTER, WE NOTE FROM THE NOVEMBER 27 
EDITION OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER 
\"L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR\" THAT SYRIAN EX-PRESIDENT NUR AL-DIN 
AL-ATASI (WHO WAS PRESIDENT WHEN ASAD SEIZED POWER IN 
1970) REPORTEDLY ARRIVED IN PARIS BY PRIVATE PLANE FROM 
DAMASCUS A FEW DAYS EARLIER TO BEGIN TREATMENT AT THE 
AMERICAN HOSPITAL IN NEUILLY OF CANCER OF THE 
ESOPHAGUS.  AL-ATASI WAS FREED ON MEDICAL GROUNDS IN 
LATE AUGUST.  UNTIL RECENTLY A SYRIAN HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP 
BASED IN PARIS ALLEGED THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS 
HINDERING AL-ATASI\'S FAMILY\'S EFFORTS TO TRANSPORT HIM 
TO PARIS (A CHARGE DENIED AT THE TIME BY AN MFA 
OFFICIAL). 
 
3.  COMMENT:  AMONG THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS LATEST 
RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IS THE 22ND ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE \"CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT\" COUP THAT BROUGHT ASAD 
TO POWER.  ALTHOUGH THAT ANNIVERSARY ACTUALLY FELL ON 
NOVEMBER 16, A LAG OF TWO WEEKS WOULD FOLLOW THE PATTERN 
OF PREVIOUS RELEASES (THE LATE MARCH RELEASE WAS 
ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS AFTER ASAD\'S SWEARING-IN TO A FOURTH 
TERM IN OFFICE, WHILE LAST DECEMBER\'S AMNESTY WAS 
PUBLICIZED TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL 
REFERENDUM).  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THESE RELEASES 
ARE RELATED TO SESSIONS OF THE STATE SECURITY COURT THAT 
HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY FOR SOME TIME TO DETERMINE THE 
SENTENCES FOR POLITICAL DETAINEES WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY 
BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL. 
 
4.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  THIS LATEST AMNESTY FOLLOWS THE 
APPEARANCE IN THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION OF THE OFFICIAL 
NEWSPAPER \"AL-BA\'TH\" OF AN EDITORIAL WRITTEN BY VICE 
PRESIDENT MASHARQA CHIDING WESTERN GOVERNMENTS FOR THEIR 
CRITICISMS OF SYRIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  MASHARQA 
ACCUSED THESE GOVERNMENTS OF APPLYING DOUBLE STANDARDS 
IN JUDGING THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES WHILE IGNORING PROBLEMS (LIKE RACIAL 
DISCRIMINATION) IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES OR IN \"RACIST 
COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA.\"  AS FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, MASHARQA COMPLAINED THAT 
THESE GROUPS FAIL TO PAY ATTENTION TO \"ISRAELI CRIMES.\" 
HE CONCLUDED THAT \"THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE STANDS OF MOST 
WESTERN STATES AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE ISSUE OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS IS TO PUT PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES WHOSE 
POLICIES ARE GOVERNED BY NATIONAL OR PAN-ARAB INTERESTS 
WHICH ARE NOT HARMONIOUS WITH THEIR PURPOSES AND 
INTERESTS.\"  WHILE THE DECISION TO LET AL-ATASI GO TO 
PARIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN MADE QUIETLY TO SATISFY 
EXTERNAL CRITICS, ASAD IS TRYING NOT TO LOOK LIKE HE 
YIELDED TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE 
AMNESTY.  MASHARQA\'S TOUGH PUBLIC STANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
BEFORE THESE RELEASES ECHOES THE ONE ASAD USED IN HIS 
MARCH 14 INAUGURATION SPEECH, WHICH CAME TWO WEEKS 
BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SIMILAR AMNESTY.

SUBJECT:  SYRIANS RELEASE 45 LEBANESE SUNNI ISLAMIC 
-         FUNDAMENTALISTS AS PART OF DECEMBER 1 AMNESTY 
 
REF:  DAMASCUS 8757 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.  (U)  THE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER \"AL-NAHAR\" REPORTED 
DECEMBER 4 THAT 45 MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC UNIFICATION 
MOVEMENT (HARIKAT AL-TAWHID AL-ISLAMI), WHO WERE 
IMPRISONED IN SYRIA, WERE FREED AND RETURNED TO THEIR 
HOMES IN TRIPOLI, LEBANON, AS PART OF THE AMNESTY 
COVERING 554 POLITICAL DETAINEES WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED IN 
DAMASCUS ON DECEMBER 1.  A TAWHID SPOKESMAN CLAIMED IN 
THE SAME ARTICLE THAT THE SYRIANS ARE STILL DETAINING 
120 MEMBERS OF TAWHID.  WE NOTICE FROM FBIS REPORTING 
THAT RADIO TEHRAN REPORTED THE SAME NEWS ON DECEMBER 3. 
 
2.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE RELEASE OF THE LEBANESE TAWHID 
MEMBERS ELABORATES ON THE ASSERTION IN THE LEBANESE 
NEWSPAPER \"L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR\" THAT MANY OF THOSE FREED 
UNDER THE DECEMBER 1 AMNESTY WERE ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS.  WE HAVE ASSUMED, ON THE BASIS OF PAST 
RELEASES, THAT A SIZEABLE PROPORTION OF RECENTLY 
LIBERATED PRISONERS WERE DETAINEES SUSPECTED OF HAVING 
HAD SOME SORT OF CONNECTION TO THE OUTLAWED SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  THE \"AL-NAHAR\" AND IRANIAN ITEMS 
ARE THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE THAT LEBANESE 
DETAINEES ARE ALSO BENEFITING FROM THE DECEMBER 1 
AMNESTY.  THE TAWHID AL-ISLAMI FOUGHT THE SYRIAN ARMY IN 
TRIPOLI OFF AND ON UNTIL 1985, WHEN (FOLLOWING THE 
TAWHID\'S KIDNAPPING OF SOVIET DIPLOMATS) THE SYRIANS 
INVESTED IN BITTER STREET FIGHTING TO NEUTRALIZE THE 
TAWHID AS A SECURITY THREAT.  THERE HAS FOR A LONG TIME 
BEEN A BIZARRE CONNECTION BETWEEN SHIA IRAN AND TAWHID 
LEADER SAID SHA\'BAN WHICH, IN THE MID-1980\'S, WAS AN 
IRRITANT IN SYRIAN-IRANIAN RELATIONS.  THE TAWHID WENT 
UNDERGROUND AFTER THE EVENTS OF 1985 AND MAY HAVE 
EVENTUALLY REACHED A MODUS VIVENDI WITH THE SYRIANS THAT 
PERMITS IT TO OPERATE OPENLY IN SOME FORM, THOUGH WE 
DEFER TO EMBASSY BEIRUT AND WASHINGTON ANALYSTS FOR 
DEFINITIVE WORD ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE TAWHID.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  RUSSIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS, ALTHOUGH 
ENJOYING TIES OF LONG STANDING TO THE SYRIAN 
MILITARY/SECURITY ELITE, ARE, LIKE US, FINDING IT 
DIFFICULT TO SORT FACT FROM FICTION REGARDING THE 
AFTERMATH OF BASIL AL-ASAD\'S DEATH.  RUSSIAN DCM 
MIKHAIL BOGDANOV RELATED THEIR BELIEF THAT BASHAR 
AL-ASAD WAS THRUST TO THE FORE AFTER HIS FATHER 
LEARNED THAT TWO SENIOR COMMANDERS HAD INCREASED 
THE ALERT STATUS OF THEIR TROOPS IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOWING BASIL\'S DEATH.  THEY ALLEGEDLY DID SO IN 
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT RIF\'AT DID NOT MOUNT A 
COMEBACK.  BOGDANOV ALSO BELIEVED THAT MAJOR 
GENERAL KHALID HUSAYN, THE LONG-TIME COMMANDER OF 
ASAD\'S BODYGUARDS, HAD BEEN RELIEVED OF HIS 
COMMAND FOR CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY OF 
REPUBLICAN GUARD COMMANDER ADNAN MAKHLUF, THE 
PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER-IN-LAW.  AS FOR SUCCESSION 
SCENARIOS, THE RUSSIANS SEEM AS PUZZLED AS MOST, 
ALTHOUGH THEY CLEARLY HAVE BEEN DOING SOME 
SPECULATING OF THEIR OWN.  THEY BELIEVE IN 
TENTATIVE FASHION THAT THE CLIQUE OF SENIOR 
ALAWITES AROUND ASAD WILL BE WARY ABOUT ALLOWING A 
SUNNI TO BECOME EVEN A FIGUREHEAD PRESIDENT, BUT 
NEITHER DO THEY SEE THE ALAWITE INNER CIRCLE AS 
HAVING ANYONE POSSESSING THE REQUISITE ATTRIBUTES 
TO LEAD A POST-ASAD SYRIA.  THEY ARE NOW LOOKING 
AT SENIOR ALAWITE CIVILIANS ON THE REGIONAL 
COMMAND OF THE BA\'TH PARTY.  WE CONTINUE TO 
BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO FORECAST A 
LIKELY REPLACEMENT FOR PRESIDENT ASAD.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF THE MILITARY AND 
SECURITY ELITE AROUND PRESIDENT ASAD CONTINUE TO 
CHALLENGE SOME OF THE BEST POSITIONED DIPLOMATIC 
MISSIONS HERE, DESPITE THE REGIME\'S 24 YEARS IN 
POWER.  AMONG THOSE CONFIRMING THIS FACT (IN A 
MEETING WITH THE DCM FEBRUARY 2) IS RUSSIAN DCM 
MIKHAIL BOGDANOV, WHO HAS SPENT TWO LENGTHY TOURS 
HERE AND WHO HAS HAD ACCESS AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER 
TO MANY SENIOR REGIME FIGURES.  (BOGDANOV 
ACCOMPANIED RIF\'AT AL-ASAD ON THE PLANE THAT TOOK 
HIM TO MOSCOW IN 1984 TO BEGIN HIS FIRST PERIOD OF 
EXILE.  GENERALS ALI HAYDAR AND SHAFIQ FAYYAD WERE 
ALSO ON THAT FLIGHT, ALTHOUGH THEY, OF COURSE, 
WERE NOT EXILED.) 
 
4.  NEVERTHELESS, BOGDANOV ADMITTED THAT HIS 
EMBASSY REMAINED HARD PRESSED TO SORT OUT THE 
AFTERMATH OF BASIL AL-ASAD\'S DEATH, PARTICULARLY 
AS IT AFFECTS REGIME SUCCESSION SCENARIOS.  HE, 
TOO, BELIEVES THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO ASSUME THAT 
THE NEXT ELDEST SON, BASHAR, WILL BECOME AN 
IMPORTANT PLAYER, DESPITE THE RECENT PROMINENCE 
ACCORDED HIM AND HIS ASSUMPTION OF BASIL\'S FORMER 
COMMAND AS HEAD OF A BRIGADE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN 
GUARDS (SEE DAMASCUS 558).  BOGDANOV BELIEVES, AS 
DO WE, THAT BASHAR\'S ROLE MAY INITIALLY BE 
INTENDED TO KEEP REGIME RIVALRIES IN CHECK. 
 
5.  TO BUTTRESS HIS THESIS, BOGDANOV RELATED A 
STORY THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM, TO 
THE EFFECT THAT THE NEW THIRD CORPS COMMANDER 
SHAFIQ FAYYAD AND SPECIAL FORCES COMMANDER ALI 
HAYDAR RAISED THE ALERT STATUS OF THEIR TROOPS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING OF BASIL\'S DEATH IN AN 
AUTO ACCIDENT.  THE PRESIDENT, HEARING OF THEIR 
ACTION, ALLEGEDLY QUESTIONED THE REASONS FOR IT 
AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY FEARED RIF\'AT MIGHT SOMEHOW 
TRY TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION.  IT WAS AT THIS 
POINT, THE RUSSIAN CONTENDED, THAT PRESIDENT ASAD 
MADE THE DECISION TO PUSH BASHAR TO THE FORE. 
 
6.  CONTINUING IN THIS VEIN, BOGDANOV ALSO RELATED 
TWO DIFFERENT RUMORS CONCERNING THE HEAD OF ASAD\'S 
PERSONAL BODYGUARDS, KHALID HUSAYN, WHO HAS NOT 
BEEN SEEN SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  ONE 
RUMOR WAS THAT HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK (WE HAD 
ALREADY HEARD THIS ONE); THE SECOND VERSION WAS 
THAT HE HAD ASSERTED FOR HIMSELF A POSITION 
SUPERIOR TO REPUBLICAN GUARD COMMANDER (AND ASAD 
BROTHER-IN-LAW) ADNAN MAKHLUF AND BEEN RELIEVED OF 
HIS DUTIES AS A RESULT.  (COMMENT: WHATEVER THE 
FACTS, KHALID HUSAYN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GUARDING 
PRESIDENT ASAD AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 6, DURING KING 
HUSSAYN\'S VISIT TO DAMASCUS.) 
 
7.  ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIANS WERE NOT AT QARDAHA FOR 
THE FUNERAL SERVICE, UPON HEARING FROM US THAT 
GENERAL ADNAN AL-ASAD, A NEPHEW OF THE PRESIDENT 
HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS (SUCH AS 
THEY WERE), BOGDANOV CLAIMED THAT ADNAN\'S ONCE 
BRIGHT STAR AS HEAD OF THE \"STRUGGLE COMPANIES\" 
WAS IN ECLIPSE.  HE FINGERED HIM AND GHAZI KAN\'AN, 
THE SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE CZAR IN LEBANON, AS BOTH 
DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING BEEN PASSED OVER ON THE 
LATEST PROMOTION LIST.  (COMMENT: WE DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO FARED ANY WORSE THAN MOST 
OF THEIR PEERS IN THE LATEST PROMOTION CYCLE.) 
 
8.  IN SPEAKING OF CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS OF 
PRESIDENT ASAD, BOGDANOV RELATED ANOTHER RUMOR 
THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING: THE REASON THE YOUNGEST 
ASAD CHILD, MAJID, HAD NOT BEEN AT THE FUNERAL WAS 
THAT HE, HIMSELF, HAD BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS EARLIER AND HAD REQUIRED 
HOSPITALIZATION IN GERMANY.  PRESIDENT ASAD HAD 
ASKED BASIL TO LOOK AFTER MAJID\'S NEEDS, HENCE 
THAT IS WHY BASIL WAS SPEEDING TO CATCH THE FRIDAY 
MORNING LUFTHANSA FLIGHT TO FRANKFURT.  (COMMENT: 
WE, TOO, HEARD THE STORY OF MAJID\'S ACCIDENT, BUT 
SEEMINGLY MORE RELIABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT 
THIS STORY WAS INTENDED TO COVER MAJID\'S DRUG 
REHABILITATION TREATMENT IN GERMANY.) 
 
9.  AS FOR SUCCESSION, BOGDANOV ADMITTED THAT HIS 
EMBASSY WAS AS BEREFT OF RELIABLE INFORMATION AS 
MOST OTHERS.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE CLIQUE OF 
ALAWITE SENIOR OFFICERS WOULD SEE IT AS TOO 
THREATENING TO ALLOW A PROMINENT REGIME SUNNI, 
SUCH AS VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM OR ARMED FORCES 
CHIEF OF STAFF SHIHABI, TO ASCEND TO THE 
PRESIDENCY.  EVEN A FRONT MAN COULD GET IDEAS. 
YET, BOGDANOV CLAIMED, HE WAS HARD PRESSED TO 
IDENTIFY A SENIOR ALAWITE OFFICER WITH THE 
STATURE, POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, AND REPUTATION TO 
SUCCEED ASAD.  GENERAL MAKHLUF LACKED THE DIRECT 
COMBAT EXPERIENCE OF HIS PEERS.  RIF\'AT REMAINED A 
DIVISIVE FIGURE.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT DEPUTY CHIEF OF 
STAFF ALI ASLAN, BOGDANOV SAID THAT HE MAY HAVE 
BEEN \"RETIRED\" BUT ALLOWED TO STAY ON AN EXTRA 
YEAR.  AT THE MOMENT BOGDANOV UNDERSTOOD ASLAN WAS 
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE HEALTH OF A SON WHO WAS IN 
DANGER OF DYING FROM A LONG-TERM ILLNESS 
(UNSPECIFIED). 
 
10.  BOGDANOV SAID THAT IN HIS EMBASSY\'S MUSINGS 
ON A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IZZ AL-DIN NASIR WAS 
TOUTED AS A REAL CONTENDER.  WHEN ASKED WHY NASIR, 
THE LONG-TIME PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL 
CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, WAS SEEN AS A 
CONTENDER, BOGDANOV REPLIED THAT HE MET THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF MEMBERSHIP ON THE 
REGIONAL COMMAND OF THE BA\'TH PARTY; ENJOYED THE 
SUPPORT OF SEVERAL SENIOR ALAWITE OFFICERS, MOST 
IMPORTANTLY SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA; WAS POPULAR AMONG 
THE PARTY RANK AND FILE; AND, OF COURSE, WAS AN 
ALAWITE. 
 
11.  COMMENT:  WE REPORT BOGDANOV\'S OBSERVATIONS 
PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE RATHER UNREMARKABLE, 
PARTICULARLY COMING FROM A VETERAN SYRIA WATCHER 
WHO HAS HAD DIRECT ACCESS OVER THE YEARS TO SENIOR 
MILITARY OFFICIALS AND TO THE REPORTS OF THE LARGE 
SOVIET ADVISORY GROUP THAT HAS WORKED WITH THE 
SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.  BOGDANOV CLEARLY WAS HAVING 
THE SAME PROBLEMS MOST OF HIS DIPLOMATIC 
COLLEAGUES HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN SIFTING FACT FROM 
FICTION IN A SOCIETY WHERE INFORMATION IS AS 
TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AS WAS FORMERLY THE CASE IN 
SOME OF THE MORE REPRESSIVE EASTERN EUROPEAN 
STATES.  THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY APPEARS GENUINELY 
UNABLE TO LAY ODDS ON POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS IN THE 
WAKE OF BASIL\'S UNTIMELY DEMISE.  ALL OF THE 
FOREGOING SUGGESTS TO US THAT A HEALTHY DOSE OF 
HUMILITY, CAUTION, AND SKEPTICISM IS CALLED FOR IN 
HANDICAPPING THE SUCCESSION SWEEPSTAKES. 
 
12.  AMBASSADOR\'S COMMENT:  AT A FEBRUARY 1 DINNER 
MEETING OF THE RUSSIAN, FRENCH, BRITISH, EGYPTIAN, 
AND US AMBASSADORS, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ZOTOV 
SHARED MOST OF BOGDANOV\'S INFORMATION AND MUSINGS 
AS HIS OWN, AGAIN WITH LITTLE SENSE OF HOW ANY 
SUCCESSION SCENARIO MIGHT PLAY OUT.  WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF BRITISH AMBASSADOR GREEN, WHO 
BELIEVES THAT RIF\'AT AL-ASAD COULD PROVE TO BE THE 
ALAWITES\' RALLYING-POINT WHEN HAFIZ AL-ASAD PASSES 
AWAY, NONE OF THE AMBASSADORS PRESENT WAS PREPARED 
TO PUT FORTH ANYTHING APPROACHING A DEFINITIVE 
VIEW OF THE SUCCESSION.

2.  SUMMARY:  MUHAMMAD MAKHLUF TOLD US HIS NEPHEW 
BASHAR AL-ASAD IS RETURNING TO DAMASCUS SOON (AFTER 
MILITARY TRAINING IN HIMS) TO TAKE UP FULL TIME HIS 
LATE BROTHER BASIL\'S FORMER PORTFOLIO IN DOMESTIC 
AFFAIRS.  HE DOES NOT, HOWEVER, SEE MUCH OF A ROLE 
FOR BASHAR IN LEBANON.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT, AFTER 
PEACE, SYRIA WOULD WITHDRAW FROM LEBANON, OR REMAIN 
ONLY AT LEBANESE INSISTENCE.  ACCORDING TO MAKHLUF, 
SYRIA WILL CONTINUE TO REJECT SECRET TALKS WITH THE 
ISRAELIS, AND WILL INSIST ON A CONTINUED U.S. ROLE, 
WHICH IT SEES AS ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 
HE ADDED THAT THE U.S. WAS NAIVE TO PROMOTE DIRECT 
ISRAELI/ARAB CONTACTS BECAUSE THEY WOULD PROMOTE 
ONLY ISRAELI, NOT U.S. INTERESTS.  ON AFFAIRS 
CLOSER TO HIS POCKETBOOK, MAKHLUF SAID THAT HE 
WOULD BE THE ONLY EFFECTIVE AGENT FOR BOEING. 
MAKHLUF\'S WORDS REFLECT BOTH THE TYPE OF VIEWS THAT 
ASAD HEARS AND HIS CURRENT POLICY LINE.    END 
SUMMARY 
 
3.  IN A DECEMBER 15 CONVERSATION WITH THE DCM AND 
ECONOFF, PRESIDENT ASAD\'S BROTHER-IN-LAW, MUHAMMAD 
MAKHLUF, SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S OLDEST LIVING 
SON, BASHAR WOULD SOON TAKE UP FULLY HIS DECEASED 
OLDER BROTHER BASIL\'S FORMER ROLE AS THE 
PRESIDENT\'S EYES AND EARS IN SYRIAN SOCIETY. 
BASHAR RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM AN ARMOR SCHOOL IN 
HIMS AND WILL RETURN TO DAMASCUS ON DECEMBER 20. 
ACCORDING TO MAKHLUF, BASHAR WILL BE PRIMARILY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE PROPER OPERATION OF 
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH, SAID 
MAKHLUF, ARE RIVEN WITH INCOMPETENCE AND 
CORRUPTION.  PRESIDENT ASAD, MAKHLUF NOTED, HAD HAD 
TO CARRY TOO LARGE A BURDEN SINCE BASIL\'S DEATH, 
AND BASHAR SHOULD NOW BE IN A POSITION TO SHOULDER 
SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RULING. 
 
4.  IN RESPONSE TO THE DCM\'S QUESTION, MAKHLUF 
INDICATED THAT, UNLIKE BASIL, BASHAR WOULD NOT HAVE 
A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LEBANON (SEE REPORTING IN 
OTHER CHANNELS POINTING TO HIS AND LEBANESE 
LEADERS\' EFFORTS TG BUILD TIES TO ONE ANOTHER), AND 
WOULD FOCUS ON THE SYRIAN INTERNAL SCENE.  MAKHLUF 
SAID THAT THE PRESS OF FOREIGN POLICY, INCLUDING 
THE PEACE PROCESS AND INTENSIFIED RELATIONS WITH 
EGYPT, LEFT LITTLE TIME FOR ASAD TO DEAL WITH 
DOMESTIC ISSUES, THUS CREATING A VACUUM, WHICH 
BASHAR WOULD NOW BE EXPECTED TO FILL.  MAKHLUF 
EMPHASIZED BASHAR\'S FITNESS FOR HIS NEW ROLE, 
CLAIMING THAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRAINING HAD MADE HIM 
A \"REAL MILITARY MAN.\"  (COMMENT:  SINCE MOST 
POLITICAL FIGURES OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN SYRIA HAVE 
MILITARY BACKGROUNDS, BASHAR\'S HAVING THEORETICALLY 
BECOME A SOLDIER LENDS HIM AT LEAST A FACADE OF 
CREDIBILITY.  END COMMENT) 
 
SYRIA WANTS OUT OF LEBANON, UNLESS... 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  ON THE SUBJECT OF SYRIA\'S PRESENCE IN LEBANON, 
MAKHLUF COMPLAINED ABOUT THE COSTS, BOTH FINANCIAL 
AND IN LOSS OF READINESS, FOR THE SYRIAN MILITARY. 
HE SAID THAT, WITH PEACE, SYRIA WOULD WITHDRAW FROM 
LEBANON.  MAKHLUF FOLLOWED THIS SEEMINGLY EMPHATIC 
STATEMENT WITH THE QUALIFIER THAT THIS POLICY WAS 
FIRM, UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE GOL \"INSISTED\" THAT 
SOME SYRIAN FORCES REMAIN. HE ADDED THAT, WITH 
PEACE, HIZBALLAH WOULD BE \"ELIMINATED\" (AS A 
MILITARY ENTITY) BY THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES, 
WITH SYRIAN SUPPORT. 
 
6.  AS EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS TO LEBANON OF 
SYRIA\'S PRESENCE IN LEBANON, MAKHLUF CITED ACTIVITY 
AGAINST THE \"POISON\" OF NARCOTICS, SAYING THAT 
SYRIA HAD SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATING NARCOTICS 
CULTIVATION IN ITS NEIGHBOR\'S LAND, WHERE THE U.S. 
HAD FAILED IN SIMILAR ATTEMPTS. 
 
7.  IN REPONSE TO THE DCM\'S STATEMENT THAT WE 
ACKNOWLEDGE SYRIA\'S AND LEBANON\'S EFFECTIVE ACTIONS 
AGAINST CULTIVATORS, BUT WANT MORE DONE AGAINST THE 
UBIQUITOUS PROCESSING LABS, MAKHLUF CLAIMED THAT 
SYRIA DID NOT WANT TO INTERFERE WITH LEBANON\'S 
DAILY OPERATIONS BECAUSE SUCH ACTIVITIES INEVITABLY 
LED TO CRITICISM OF SYRIA FOR DEROGATING LEBANESE 
SOVEREIGNTY, A FACTOR WHICH HE ALSO CLAIMED KEPT 
SYRIAN TROOPS FROM CONDUCTING LARGE, VISIBLE 
TRAINING OPERATIONS IN LEBANON.  INSTEAD, SYRIA 
PREFERRED TO KEEP ITS TROOPS LARGELY IN THEIR 
GARRISONS AND RESPOND ONLY TO LEBANESE REQUESTS FOR 
ASSISTANCE.  MAKHLUF LAMENTED SYRIA\'S INABILITY TO 
PUBLICIZE ITS \"GOOD DEEDS\" IN LEBANON, SUCH AS 
RECONCILING ITS LEADERS OR COMBATTING DRUGS BECAUSE 
SUCH WORDS WOULD BE EXPLOITED TO CRITICIZE SYRIA\'S 
BENEFICENT ROLE. 
 
LATEST LINE ON THE PEACE PROCESS 
-------------------------------- 
 
8.  MAKHLUF LARGELY STUCK TO THE CURRENT SYRIAN 
PUBLIC LINE ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENT, 
INDEED, HAD MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION FOR PEACE, 
BUT HE WOULD INSIST THAT IT BE WITH DIGNITY AND 
HONOR.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT SYRIA INSISTS ON A 
CONTINUED U.S. ROLE AND THAT SECRET, DIRECT TALKS 
WITH ISRAEL WERE UNACCEPTABLE.  MAKHLUF REITERATED 
ASAD\'S COMMITMENT TO THE PEACE PROCESS UNDER U.S. 
AUSPICES, BUT CONSTANTLY EXPRESSED SUSPICIONS ABOUT 
ISRAEL\'S ULTIMATE INTENTIONS.  CHARACTERISTICALLY, 
HE DERIDED THE ISRAELI AGREEMENTS WITH THE PLO AND 
JORDAN.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT ASAD WOULD ONLY LOOK FOR 
A STRATEGY OTHER THAN U.S. MEDIATION IF HE FELT 
THAT SUCH MEDIATION ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT WORK. 
(COMMENT:  THIS LAST EXPRESSION WAS AMBIGUOUS, BUT 
IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN IMPLICIT THREAT OF 
RENEWED PROXY VIOLENCE, THAN CONSIDERATION OF 
DIRECT TALKS.  END COMMENT) 
 
9.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT A FRIEND OF HIS VISITING THE 
U.S. HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY A \"SENIOR AMERICAN JEW\" 
WHO SAID THAT SYRIA COULD DO FAR BETTER DEALING 
DIRECTLY WITH ISRAEL THAN THROUGH THE U.S., AND 
OFFERED TO BROKER SUCH CONTACTS.   MAKHLUF SAID HE 
HAD SENT HIS FRIEND TO TELL HIS STORY TO THE 
FONMIN, BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO CHANGE IN ASAD\'S 
POLICY ON THE BASIS OF THIS OR ANY OTHER ISRAELI 
APPROACH.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT SYRIA WANTS A REAL 
PEACE, NOT A FAKE OR A FANTASY PEACE, AS EXISTS 
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SOME OF THE OTHER ARABS. 
 
10.  MAKHLUF ADDED THAT HIS READING OF HISTORY 
CONVINCED HIM THAT THE ISRAELIS/JEWS ONLY PROTECTED 
THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND THAT THE U.S. WAS 
DISPLAYING \"NAIVETE\" IN PROMOTING ISRAELI/GULF 
CONTACTS.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMARK ALLUDES TO AN 
EARLIER CONVERSATION MAKHLUF HAD WITH US IN WHICH 
HE WARNED THAT ISRAEL SOUGHT TO DOMINATE TRADE IN 
THE REGION\'S OIL TO THE DETRIMENT OF U.S. STRATEGIC 
AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.)  MAKHLUF EXPRESSED 
MYSTIFICATION AS TO WHY THE ISRAELIS WOULD WANT 
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SYRIA, SINCE WITHOUT U.S. 
SUPPORT, THERE WOULD BE NO ISRAEL. 
 
MAKHLUF WANTS \"TO HELP\" BOEING 
---------------------------- 
 
11.  AFTER A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE DESIRABILITY 
OF INCREASED U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE SYRIAN 
ECONOMY, MAKHLUF QUICKLY TURNED THE DISCUSSION TO 
BOEING\'S INTEREST IN SELLING CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT TO 
SYRIAN ARAB AIRLINES (SAA).  AFTER STATING THAT 
BOEING\'S CURRENT LOCAL AGENT WAS HIS \"FRIEND,\" 
MAKHLUF WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT COMPETENT TO 
MAKE THIS DEAL.  AIRBUS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD 
MADE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS IN ITS PROPOSED DEAL 
WITH SAA AND WAS NEARLY READY TO SIGN.  IN ANSWER 
TO ECONOFF\'S QUESTION ABOUT THE UTILITY OF ANY 
AGENT SINCE THE PRESIDENT WOULD DECIDE PERSONALLY 
ABOUT THIS PURCHASE, MAKHLUF SAID THAT EVEN THE 
PRESIDENT COULD NOT DECIDE ON BOEING IF AIRBUS 
OFFERED A MUCH BETTER DEAL, AND THE RIGHT AGENT 
COULD ENSURE THAT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE.  NOT 
SURPRISINGLY, MAKHLUF THEN SAID THAT HE AND HIS SON 
WANTED VERY MUCH TO MEET WITH BOEING.  ECONOFF SAID 
HE WOULD CONVEY THIS INFORMATION TO BOEING. 
 
12.  COMMENT:  MAKHLUF, WHO IS NOT WITHOUT A 
CERTAIN ROGUISH CHARM, NEVERTHELESS WEARS HIS 
BIGOTRY AND AVARICE ON HIS WELL-TAILORED SLEEVE. 
WE CONVEY HIS VIEWS AS AN INDICATION OF WHAT ASAD 
IS LIKELY TELLING TO AND HEARING FROM THOSE AROUND 
HIM.  HIS COMMENTS ON THE NEED FOR BASHAR TO BECOME 
MORE ACTIVE ON THE DOMESTIC SCENE ARE CONSISTENT 
WITH ALL OTHER REPORTING AVAILABLE TO US.  HOWEVER, 
DESPITE MAKHLUF\'S COMMENTS TO THE CONTRARY 
PRESIDENT ASAD SEEMS TO BE USING BASHAR AND GID 
OPERATIVE NASSIF AS COUNTERWEIGHTS TO KHADDAM AND 
SHIHABI IN LEBANON.  AS FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, 
MAKHLUF\'S BLUNT COMMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE 
SUSPICIONS WITH WHICH ASAD AND HIS INNER CIRCLE 
VIEW ISRAELI INTENTIONS, AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR OWN MILITARY/DIPLOMATIC 
POSITION VIS A VIS ISRAEL.  FOR THEM, THE U.S. ROLE 
IS ESSENTIAL AND THE DEALS CONCLUDED BETWEEN ISRAEL 
ON THE ONE HAND AND JORDAN AND THE PLO ON THE OTHER 
HAVE ONLY REINFORCED THIS CONVICTION.

2.  SUMMARY.  IN THE CONTINUING ABSENCE OF FOREIGN 
MINISTER SHARA IN CARTAGENA AND NEW YORK, SENIOR 
MFA OFFICIALS HAVE TAKEN EVERY AVAILABLE 
OPPORTUNITY SHORT OF CALLING US IN TO VENT THEIR 
SPLEENS OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS RENEWED ATTEMPTS TO 
PUT PRESSURE ON SYRIA AND WEAKEN ITS POSITION 
VIS-A-VIS ISRAEL.  OUR MFA INTERLOCUTORS HAVE 
FOCUSED ON TWO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: (A) WHAT THEY 
VIEW AS AN \"UNBALANCED\" U.S. POSTURE ON RECENT 
EVENTS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON AND (B) \"TENDENTIOUS\" 
ACCUSATIONS THAT COUNTERFEIT U.S. CURRENCY MAY BE 
PRODUCED IN SYRIA OR LEBANON.  SHARA WOULD 
CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THEIR VIEWS, AND 
THIS MAY ADD AN EDGE TO ANY FUTURE HIGH-LEVEL 
CONTACTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON OCTOBER 18, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SHAKKUR 
AND MFA AMERICAS DIRECTOR JAZZAR SOUGHT THE 
AMBASSADOR OUT SEPARATELY AT A RECEPTION TO 
COMPLAIN ABOUT (A) WHAT THEY VIEW AS AN 
\"UNBALANCED\" U.S. POSTURE ON RECENT EVENTS IN 
SOUTHERN LEBANON, AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE 
DEPARTMENT\'S OCTOBER 16 PRESS BRIEFING, AND (B) 
\"TENDENTIOUS\" ACCUSATIONS THAT COUNTERFEIT U.S. 
CURRENCY MAY BE PRODUCED IN SYRIA OR LEBANON AND 
PROTECTED BY THE SYRIAN MILITARY, AS \"MANY AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT\" CONSIDER TO BE A \"FACT,\" 
ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN THE OCTOBER 23 ISSUE OF 
\"THE NEW YORKER.\"  THEY REACTED TO BOTH 
DEVELOPMENTS ALONG SIMILAR LINES. 
 
4.  ON OUR POSTURE WITH REGARD TO SOUTHERN 
LEBANON, AS ENUNCIATED OCTOBER 16, THEY ARGUED 
THAT: 
 
-- NO ONE SHOULD FORGET -- AS IT WOULD APPEAR MANY 
HAVE -- THAT SOUTHERN LEBANON REMAINS UNDER 
ISRAELI OCCUPATION, THAT HIZBALLAH IS EXERCISING 
THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF LEBANESE TO RESIST 
OCCUPATION FORCES, AND THAT THIS RIGHT IS BEING 
EXERCISED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF DAILY SHELLING 
AND BOMBING OF LEBANESE VILLAGES AND NUMEROUS 
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. 
 
-- HIZBALLAH, AS A FORCE THAT CRYSTALLIZES 
LEBANESE OPPOSITION TO ISRAELI OCCUPATION, 
EXPRESSES THIS OPPOSITION INDEPENDENTLY OF OUTSIDE 
ACTORS. 
 
-- SYRIA RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF LEBANESE TO 
RESIST THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION THROUGH ATTACKS ON 
ISRAELI MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE OCCUPIED ZONE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, IT RECOGNIZES THAT AN ESCALATION 
OF THE SITUATION COULD HARM THE PEACE PROCESS. 
 
-- SYRIA DOES HAVE INFLUENCE WITH HIZBALLAH AND 
HAS USED IT ON MANY OCCASIONS IN THE PAST, WHEN 
VIOLENCE HAS ESCALATED TO A DANGEROUS LEVEL AND 
WHEN SYRIA WAS SATISFIED THAT WE WERE URGING 
RESTRAINT ON THE ISRAELIS TO TAMP DOWN WHAT WE 
HAVE TRADITIONALLY CALLED \"THE CONTINUING CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE.\" 
 
-- ON THIS OCCASION, HOWEVER, WE CHOSE TO SOLICIT 
SYRIAN ASSISTANCE \"IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE 
MANNER.\"  FIRST, OF ALL, WE DID IT IN PUBLIC. 
SECOND OF ALL, WE GROUNDED OUR SOLICITATION IN 
WHAT WAS, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THE 
ISRAELI VIEW OF EVENTS, ABANDONING OUR TRADITIONAL 
 
-- AND MINIMALLY ACCEPTABLE -- LINE ABOUT \"THE 
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE,\" CALLING LEBANESE RESISTANCE 
\"TERRORISM,\" ESCHEWING ANY MENTION OF THE CONTEXT 
OF THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION, FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON 
ISRAELI LOSSES, AND FOCUSING ON SYRIA AS THE PARTY 
PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE LEVEL 
OF VIOLENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON. 
 
-- ALL OF THIS LED SYRIAN LEADERS TO QUESTION ONCE 
AGAIN THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE U.S. AS \"AN HONEST 
BROKER\" IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO SUSPECT THAT 
\"CERTAIN PEOPLE\" HAD ENGINEERED A CHANGE IN OUR 
STANCE. 
 
5.  ON THE ALLEGATION THAT SYRIA MIGHT BE THE 
LOCUS OF COUNTERFEITING, THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
INTERLOCUTORS NOTED THAT: 
 
-- NOT ONCE DURING THE SUCCESSIVE VISITS OF EXPERT 
DELEGATIONS TO SYRIA HAD THIS POSSIBILITY BEEN 
MENTIONED. 
 
-- SYRIA HAD NO CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE NOTES OF THE 
HIGH QUALITY BEING CITED.  IF IT DID, IT WOULD 
HAVE NO NEED TO HAVE ITS OWN CURRENCY PRINTED 
ABROAD. 
 
-- FURTHERMORE, SYRIA HAD NO INTEREST IN BRINGING 
THE INTEGRITY OF U.S. CURRENCY INTO QUESTION, 
\"SINCE EVERY SYRIAN PROBABLY HOLDS QUANTITIES OF 
DOLLARS.\" 
 
-- AS A MATTER OF POLICY, SYRIA WAS DEEPLY OPPOSED 
TO COUNTERFEITING OF ANY KIND AND WAS SUPPORTING 
ONGOING LEBANESE EFFORTS TO TRACK DOWN 
COUNTERFEITERS ACTIVE IN LEBANON. 
 
-- AGAIN, AS WITH OUR \"NEW STANCE\" ON SOUTHERN 
LEBANON, SYRIAN LEADERS HAD TO QUESTION THE 
MOTIVES OF THOSE WHO HAD FLOATED THIS TENDENTIOUS 
ALLEGATION. 
 
6.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED TO SHAKKUR AND JAZZAR 
THAT WE REMAINED OPPOSED TO VIOLENCE AND COMMITTED 
TO NEGOTIATIONS AS A WAY OF BRINGING THE ISRAELI 
PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON TO AN END, THAT 
INDEED WE LOOKED TO SYRIA TO HELP CALM THE 
SITUATION, AND THAT WE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY LOOKING TO 
THE ISRAELIS TO DO THE SAME.  NEITHER WAS 
CONVINCED, CITING ONCE AGAIN THE \"ONE-SIDED\" 
STANCE WE HAD TAKEN ON OCTOBER 16 AND THE 
INAPPROPRIATENESS OF USING A PUBLIC FORUM TO SEEK 
SYRIAN HELP. 
 
7.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO NOTED THAT, TO THE BEST OF 
HIS INFORMATION, WE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT SYRIA WAS 
THE LOCUS OF COUNTERFEITING OF U.S. CURRENCY AND 
THAT THE SOURCES CITED BY \"THE NEW YORKER\" WERE 
EITHER MISINFORMED OR SPECULATING.  IT HAD BEEN 
AGREED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR TWO 
GOVERNMENTS THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO COUNTER 
THIS ACTIVITY, AND WE LOOKED FORWARD TO CONTINUING 
TO DO SO. 
 
8.  SHAKKUR CLOSED OFF THE DISCUSSION BY 
EMPHASIZING THAT, IF ANYONE IN THE U.S. THOUGHT 
THAT PRESSURE TACTICS WOULD WORK WITH SYRIA, THEY 
COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG.  PRESSURE MERELY 
INCREASED THE RESOLVE OF SYRIAN LEADERS TO STAY 
THE COURSE.  PRESIDENT CLINTON AND SECRETARY 
CHRISTOPHER UNDERSTOOD THE PROPER WAY TO DEAL WITH 
THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP, BUT \"OTHERS\" EVIDENTLY DID 
NOT. 
 
9.  ON OCTOBER 19, JAZZAR WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE 
AGAIN DURING A MEETING WITH POLOFF ON THE UPCOMING 
CUBAN RESOLUTION AT THE UNGA.  HE DESCRIBED OUR 
OCTOBER 16 STATEMENT AS \"HORRIBLE\" AND ASKED AGAIN 
WHY WE HAD MADE SUCH A MAJOR CHANGE IN OUR 
CUSTOMARY LINE ON THIS ISSUE.  \"WHY IS THE U.S. 
ASKING SYRIA TO USE ITS INFLUENCE WITH HIZBALLAH 
TO PREVENT LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE TO ISRAEL\'S 
OCCUPATION OF SOUTHERN LEBANON?  IT SOUNDS AS IF 
YOU HAVE ENDORSED THE OCCUPATION AND THAT YOU 
CONDEMN ALL RESISTANCE TO IT.\"  JAZZAR WENT ON TO 
SAY THAT \"SYRIA CAN SWALLOW, ALTHOUGH WITH A 
GRIMACE,\" OUR CUSTOMARY RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ON 
THIS ISSUE, BUT THE LATEST STATEMENT WAS A MAJOR 
DEPARTURE. 
 
10.  POLOFF READ JAZZAR THE DEPARTMENT\'S GUIDANCE 
ON RECENT VIOLENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON (STATE 
254743).  JAZZAR REPLIED THAT \"THIS IS YOUR USUAL 
STATEMENT, BUT IT IS NOT WHAT MR. BURNS SAID.  HE 
SAID MUCH MORE THAN THAT.  WHAT HE SAID GIVES 
HIZBALLAH MORE CREDIBILITY.  THE RESISTANCE IS NOT 
ATTACKING CHILDREN OR CIVILIANS.  IT IS ATTACKING 
MILITARY TARGETS -- THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION FORCE. 
THAT IS NOT TERRORISM.  SYRIA WILL NOT TAKE STEPS 
TO STOP LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE TO OCCUPATION.\" 
 
11.  AN OCTOBER 18 EDITORIAL IN THE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE \"SYRIA TIMES\" ECHOED THESE 
THEMES: THE DEPARTMENTAL SPOKESMAN\'S OCTOBER 16 
STATEMENT \"WAS NOT IN LINE WITH THE DECLARED U.S. 
POLICY THAT SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF U.N. 
RESOLUTIONS.\"  REFLECTING THE FEELING THAT THE 
STATEMENT DIFFERED FROM PREVIOUS ONES, THE 
EDITORIAL CONTINUED THAT \"PRESSURE SHOULD NOT BE 
DIRECTED AGAINST THE VICTIMS, BUT AGAINST THE 
OPPRESSORS.\"  PREDICTABLY, IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
\"OPERATIONS AGAINST OCCUPATION ARE A KIND OF 
SELF-DEFENSE, NO MATTER WHAT THE U.S. STATE 
DEPARTMENT THINKS OR SAYS.\" 
 
12.  COMMENT: SHARA WOULD CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE 
HIMSELF WITH SUCH VIEWS.  COMBINED WITH STANDING 
SYRIAN COMPLAINTS ABOUT BEING SINGLED OUT FOR 
BLAME OVER THE IMPASSE IN THE SYRIAN TRACK, \"WHEN 
RABIN HIMSELF DOES NOT WANT TO MOVE,\" AND 
LINGERING SYRIANS SUSPICIONS ABOUT OUR PATTERN OF 
CONSULTATIONS ON IRAQ, THESE NEW CONCERNS MAY WELL 
ADD AN EDGE TO FUTURE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS BETWEEN 
OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS. 
 
13.  THE BEST WAY TO GET SYRIA TO REIN HIZBALLAH 
IN HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO USE PRIVATE APPROACHES FIRST 
AND THEN BUTTRESS THEM WITH PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT 
CALL ON ALL PARTIES WITH A ROLE IN SOUTHERN 
LEBANON TO HELP CALM THE SITUATION.  EVEN IF THE 
SYRIANS FIND IT IN THEIR INTEREST TO COUNSEL 
RESTRAINT ON HIZBALLAH ON THIS OCCASION, OUR 
LATEST STATEMENTS HAVE RUBBED THEM IN ALL THE 
WRONG WAYS, INCREASING THEIR FEARS THAT THEY ARE 
BEING PRESSURED AND ISOLATED AND POTENTIALLY 
MAKING THEM EVEN MORE RIGID IN DISCUSSING THE 
PEACE PROCESS. 
 
14.  SIMILARLY, THE SPECULATIVE STATEMENTS OF 
UNNAMED DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS ON SYRIA\'S ALLEGED 
ROLE IN PRINTING COUNTERFEIT U.S. CURRENCY WILL 
NOT ONLY RENDER FUTURE COOPERATION IN TRACKING THE 
CULPRITS DOWN MORE DIFFICULT, BUT WILL ALSO FEED 
THE SAME FEARS OF PRESSURE AND ISOLATION.

TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, SY, IS, XF 
SUBJECT:  HAFIZ AL-ASAD: LAST DEFENDER OF ARABS 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY: 
CHRISTOPHER W.S. ROSS, AMBASSADOR.  REASON: 1.5 (D) . 
 
2. SUMMARY: THE IMAGE OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD AS THE LAST 
LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST ISRAELI ATTEMPTS TO 
\"OBLITERATE\" THE ARAB IDENTITY IS AN INCREASINGLY 
PREVALENT THEME PUT OUT BY THE SARG, AND WILL ONLY 
INTENSIFY IN THE RUN-UP TO AND AFTERMATH OF THE 
NOVEMBER 16 CELEBRATION OF 25 YEARS OF ASAD\'S RULE. 
ALTHOUGH UNREALISTIC RHETORIC IS PART OF THIS 
IMAGE-BUILDING, ASAD\'S \"ARABISM\" SHOULD NOT BE 
DISMISSED AS MERELY A PLOY.  GIVEN THE LACK OF 
FORWARD MOVEMENT IN THE SYRIAN TRACK AND GREATER 
SUSPICION OF ISRAELI MOTIVES, WE THINK ASAD WILL 
INCREASINGLY VIEW ANY NEW PEACE PROCESS PROPOSALS 
THROUGH THIS ARAB NATIONALISM OPTIC.  ONE COMPONENT 
OF THIS OPTIC IS THAT ISRAEL IS ULTIMATELY SEEKING 
TO \"CORNER\" SYRIA, AS IT HAS MANY OTHER ARAB 
PARTIES.  END SUMMARY 
 
3. ALTHOUGH THE SYRIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS 
SOUGHT TO CREATE FOR HAFIZ AL-ASAD A DOMESTIC AND 
EXTERNAL IMAGE AS AN ARAB -- RATHER THAN STRICTLY A 
SYRIAN -- LEADER, THE HYPING OF ASAD\'S DEFENSE OF 
ARAB RIGHTS HAS INTENSIFIED WITH THE LACK OF 
PROGRESS ON THE SYRIAN TRACK AND ISRAEL\'S GROWING 
RELATIONS WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE ARAB WORLD.  THE 
THEME THAT ISRAEL IS SEEKING TO \"OBLITERATE\" THE 
ARAB IDENTITY VIA WHAT ASAD CALLS \"MIDDLE 
EASTERNISM\" IS AN INCREASINGLY COMMON FEATURE OF 
SYRIAN RHETORIC. 
 
4. BUT IT IS NOT JUST RHETORIC.  WE BELIEVE IT 
COLORS HOW ASAD PERCEIVES PROPOSALS MADE IN THE 
SYRIAN TRACK, AND SYRIA\'S STANCE TOWARD THE REST OF 
THE PEACE PROCESS.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS 
SLEDGEHAMMER-LIKE PUBLIC RELATIONS TOOL WILL COME 
DOWN EVEN HARDER AS SYRIA BEGINS TO CELEBRATE THE 
SILVER ANNIVERSARY OF THE \"CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT,\" 
ASAD\'S 25 YEARS IN POWER.  THE SYRIAN BA\'TH PARTY 
IS INDEED ONLY A SHELL OF ITS FORMER SELF, BUT ONE 
OF THE FEW FACETS THAT REMAIN IS ITS IDENTITY AS AN 
ARAB -- NOT JUST SYRIAN -- MOVEMENT. 
 
5. IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NOVEMBER 16 FETING OF THE 
CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT, ASAD IS BEING EXTOLLED AS 
\"THE FIRST ARAB STRUGGLER.\"  HE IS BEING REFERRED 
TO MORE AS AN ARAB LEADER THAN THE SYRIAN LEADER, 
AND AS THE SUPREME DEFENDER OF ARAB RIGHTS.  ASAD\'S 
ARAB IMAGE PERMEATES ALL EVENTS HERE -- POLITICAL 
OR OTHERWISE.  THE MINISTER OF CULTURE RECENTLY 
OPENED AN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL IN DAMASCUS 
(WHERE AN AWARD-WINNING TUNISIAN FILM WAS EXCLUDED 
BECAUSE ITS DIRECTOR HAD TRAVELLED TO ISRAEL) WITH 
AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION FOR PRESIDENT ASAD\'S 
CONCERN FOR THE ROLE OF CINEMA IN ENLIGHTENING THE 
PEOPLE AND GIVING AN IDEA ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WHICH 
IS FACING A FIERCE ENEMY WHO TRIES TO ANNEX MORE 
ARAB LANDS IN DEFIANCE OF UN RESOLUTIONS.\"  WHETHER 
IT IS THE PREPARATORY MEETING FOR THE UPCOMING EU- 
MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE IN BARCELONA OR THE UN\'S 
WOMEN\'S CONFERENCE IN PEKING, SARG REPRESENTATIVES 
DO NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT SYRIA IS 
CARRYING THE ARAB RIGHTS MANTLE, EVEN IF, IN THE 
SARG\'S MIND, OTHER ARABS ARE NOT.  AS THE NOVEMBER 
1 OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY SAID SUBTLY, \"WHEN 
SYRIA PLAYS THE ARAB TUNE, THE ARAB MASSES REPEAT 
IT AFTER HER.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ASAD MISREADS THE ISRAELIS -- BUT DOES HE CARE? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT ASAD MISREADS THE ISRAELI 
POLITICAL EQUATION.  SARG KNOWLEDGE OF ISRAELI 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL DYNAMICS IS INDEED INADEQUATE. 
BUT THAT IS NOT THE REAL POINT.  EVEN IF THE SARG 
HAD PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THESE DYNAMICS, IT WOULD 
NOT ACT DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE OF ITS OWN SELF- 
IMPOSED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS. 
ASAD WILL DO A DEAL IF IT IS EVIDENTLY A GOOD DEAL 
FOR SYRIA, AND HE WILL NOT DO A DEAL IF IT IS NOT - 
- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER RABIN FALLS AND ASAD IS 
FORCED TO DEAL WITH A LESS FLEXIBLE LIKUD 
LEADERSHIP, OR IF THE PROCESS IS SENT INTO THE DEEP 
FREEZE WITH NO PROSPECT FOR THAWING.  A RECENT INR 
ANALYSIS FOR THE SECRETARY ACCURATELY SUMMARIZED 
MANY OF ASAD\'S PEACE PROCESS-RELATED VIEWS AS 
\"UNRECONSTRUCTED.\"  BUT THE MOST RELEVANT POINT IS 
THAT ASAD SEEMS PERFECTLY HAPPY -- AND INDEED 
PREFERS -- TO LIVE IN THAT UNRECONSTRUCTED WORLD. 
IT REQUIRES LESS CHANGE ON HIS PART. 
 
7. ALTHOUGH SYRIANS WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS 
\"CONCERN\" AND NOT \"FEAR\" WHICH DRIVES THEIR VIEWS 
OF ISRAELI MOVES, THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS IS 
THE SAME: THE BELIEF THAT, IN THE WORDS OF AN 
OCTOBER 31 OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY, ISRAEL IS 
ATTEMPTING TO \"CORNER\" SYRIA AS IT HAS DONE ITS 
OTHER ARAB NEGOTIATING PARTNERS (EXCLUDING THE 
LEBANESE), AND EVEN SOME OTHER ARAB STATES WHICH 
HAVE COMPROMISED ON THE ARAB BOYCOTT AND OPENED NEW 
AVENUES FOR GOI POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTACTS. 
(COMMENT: EVEN PARANOIDS HAVE ENEMIES.) 
 
------------------------------------- 
MORE FODDER FOR ASAD\'S \"SPINMEISTERS\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
8. ASAD IMAGE BUILDERS HAVE NOT NEEDED THE UPCOMING 
CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT ANNIVERSARY TO PROVIDE THE 
BACKGROUND FOR THEIR WORK.  EVEN BEFORE THE 
CONGRESSIONAL VOTE ON MOVING OUR EMBASSY TO 
JERUSALEM, TWO REGIONAL EVENTS GAVE THEM AMPLE 
OCCASIONS: THE AMMAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT AND QADHAFI\'S 
EXPULSION OF THE PALESTINIANS.  THE FORMER PROVIDED 
THE PLATFORM FOR SYRIAN CRITICISM OF PREMATURE 
NORMALIZATION.  EGYPTIAN FM \'AMR MUSA\'S REPORTED 
CRITICISM OF SOME PARTIES\' \"RUSH\" TO NORMALIZE 
HELPED ASAD MORE THAN IT DID MUBARAK BY ECHOING 
ASAD\'S LINE IN A MILDER FORM (NOTE: THE NOVEMBER 1 
OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY ALSO CRITICIZED THE 
\"RUSH,\" USING THE SAME WORD MUSA DID -- \"HARWALA\"). 
 
9. IN AUTHORIZING THE ENTRY OF STRANDED 
PALESTINIANS EXPELLED BY QADHAFI, ASAD ACHIEVED THE 
GOALS QADHAFI TRIED TO ACHIEVE THROUGH HIS 
EXPULSION ORDER, WITHOUT ANY OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
AND ARAB CRITICISM THE LIBYAN LEADER SUFFERED.  IN 
ONE FELL SWOOP, ASAD GOT TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT SYRIA 
CALLS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW OF THE ISRAELI-PLO 
AGREEMENTS -- THE LACK OF THE RIGHT OF RETURN -- 
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVED GLOWING PRAISE FROM THE 
STRANDED PALESTINIANS.  (COMMENT: IF WE WERE 
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS LIKE THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD 
ALMOST THINK ASAD PUT QADHAFI UP TO HIS EXPULSION 
ORDER.)  AT THE RECENT NAM SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA, THE 
SARG EVEN TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO BLOCK COSTA RICA\'S 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE NAM BECAUSE THAT COUNTRY 
MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. AS ASAD CONTINUES TO TRY TO BUILD HIS LEGACY 
AND HELP HIS SON AND OTHERS ASSUME COMMAND AFTER HE 
DIES, THE IMAGE OF ASAD\'S LEADERSHIP OF 
\"THE BEATING HEART OF ARABISM\" CAN ONLY INTENSIFY. 
HE WILL VIEW ISSUES IN THE SYRIAN TRACK THROUGH THE 
OPTIC OF ARAB PUBLIC OPINION, EVEN IF IT IS ONLY 
THE IMAGE OF THAT OPINION HE HAS CREATED FOR 
HIMSELF.  THIS PERSPECTIVE, WHILE USEFUL TO HIM IN 
THE CONTEXT OF HIS DEALINGS WITH THE ISRAELIS AND 
OTHER ARABS, IS ULTIMATELY AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF 
INTERNAL LEGITIMACY FOR A MINORITY REGIME WHICH 
SEEKS TO PREEMPT POTENTIAL OPPOSITION AT HOME.

REF:  A) DAMASCUS 2466, B) DAMASCUS 2065, C) DAMASCUS 826 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHRISTOPHER W.S. ROSS, 
REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE LATEST STORIES ON THE DAMASCUS 
RUMOR MILL SUGGEST A CLOSING OF THE RANKS WITHIN THE 
ASAD FAMILY, WITH MIXED SPECULATION THAT THE STANDING 
OF THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER RIF\'AT MAY BE IMPROVING, AND 
A SEPARATE STORY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED HIS 
SON-IN-LAW, \'ASIF SHAWQAT, TO AN IMPORTANT NEW POSTING 
IN THE SECURITY SERVICES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
MIXED REVIEWS ON RIF\'AT\'S STANDING 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) ACCORDING TO SYRIAN CONTACTS IN THE BUSINESS 
AND ACADEMIC COMMUNITIES, THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER 
RIF\'AT IS BACK AT WORK AT HIS OFFICE AND SEEMS TO BE 
CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT\'S SONS, BASHAR AND MAHIR. 
THESE CONTACTS INSIST THAT REPORTS THAT RIF\'AT HAS BEEN 
OUT OF FAVOR WITH THE PRESIDENT ARE GROSSLY 
EXAGGERATED, AND THAT RIF\'AT WAS NEVER FULLY OUT OF 
GRACE SINCE HE WAS NOT STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE AS VICE 
PRESIDENT.  IN THE EVENT THE PRESIDENT PASSES AWAY, 
THESE CONTACTS MAINTAIN THAT RIF\'AT, BOTH AS VICE 
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT\'S BROTHER, STANDS A GOOD 
CHANCE OF RALLYING THE ALAWIS AND THEIR SUNNI ALLIES 
AND ASSUMING THE PRESIDENCY. 
 
4.  (C) MEANWHILE A CONTACT IN THE SOCIALIST UNITY 
PARTY (PROTECT) TOLD US THAT PRESIDENT ASAD AND RIF\'AT 
MET MAY 10 IN QARDAHA FOR A RECONCILIATION MEETING 
(\"MUSAALAMA\").  OUR CONTACT SAID THAT THE 
RECONCILIATION WAS FOR SHOW ONLY, AND BECAUSE PRESIDENT 
ASAD WANTS RIF\'AT\'S SUPPORT TO CONVENE A NEW CONFERENCE 
OF THE B\'ATH PARTY REGIONAL COMMAND (SEE REF B) AND 
APPOINT HIS SON BASHAR TO THE COMMAND.  OUR CONTACT 
CLAIMED THAT EVEN THOUGH RIF\'AT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY 
MARGINALIZED IN THE GOVERNMENT SINCE RETURNING TO SYRIA 
FROM EXILE, PRESIDENT ASAD RECOGNIZES THAT RIF\'AT IS 
STRONGER THAN BASHAR.  ACCORDING TO THE SYRIAN 
CONSTITUTION, ANY SUCCESSOR TO THE PRESIDENT MUST COME 
FROM THE REGIONAL COMMAND. 
 
5.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO SOME OF THE VIEWS EXPRESSED 
ABOVE, OUR SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY CONTACT SAID PRESIDENT 
ASAD STILL DISTRUSTS RIF\'AT IMMENSELY, AND HAS 
FORBIDDEN MAHIR AND BASHAR EVEN TO SPEAK WITH RIF\'AT 
BEYOND SOCIAL NICETIES.  HE COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED 
RUMORS THAT RIF\'AT IS CULTIVATING MAHIR OR MAINTAINS 
GOOD TIES WITH MAHIR AND BASHAR.  HE ADDED THAT ONE OF 
THE REASONS WHY RIF\'AT\'S SON SAWMAR LEFT SYRIA SUDDENLY 
LAST YEAR (SEE REF C) IS THAT SAWMAR PULLED A GUN AND 
POINTED IT AT MAHIR DURING A DISPUTE OVER MONEY.  ONCE 
BASHAR HEARD OF THIS, HE HIT THE ROOF, SHUT DOWN 
SAWMAR\'S RESTAURANT AND RAN HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
 
6.  (C) IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH US, AN ALAWI 
FORMER DEPUTY PM AND IN-LAW OF RIF\'AT\'S (PROTECT) 
DISMISSED RUMORS THAT RIF\'AT IS BACK AT WORK IN HIS 
OFFICE.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONTACT, RIF\'AT\'S 
OFFICE IS PRIVATE, AND THUS WAS NEVER SHUT DOWN BY THE 
GOVERNMENT; AS OF NOW, RIFA\'T HAS NOT DECIDED TO RETURN 
TO THIS OFFICE.  OUR CONTACT SAID HE COULD NOT IMAGINE 
THAT RIF\'AT WILL EVER RESUME HIS DUTIES WHILE THE 
PRESIDENT IS STILL ACTIVE.  ONLY IF THE PRESIDENT WERE 
INCAPACITATED COULD HE IMAGINE RIF\'AT RESUMING ANY 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.  EVEN IN SUCH A SCENARIO, 
HE ADDED, NO ONE WOULD COME FORWARD AND EXPRESS SUPPORT 
FOR RIF\'AT UNLESS THE DECISION TO BRING HIM BACK INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT CAME FROM THE TOP, I.E., THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF. 
 
7.  (C) THE SAME CONTACT CITED IN PARA 6 DESCRIBED THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRESIDENT ASAD AND RIF\'AT AS 
\"NORMAL,\" BUT HE DID NOT SUGGEST ANY RECENT 
RECONCILIATION OR IMPROVEMENT IN TIES BETWEEN THE TWO. 
ON THE CONTRARY, HE MENTIONED THAT THE SARG IS 
DISPLEASED WITH THE RECENT ACTIVITIES OF RIF\'AT\'S SONS, 
MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW TRAVELING IN EUROPE AND ARE 
RUMORED TO BE STARTING A MAGAZINE, SUSPECTED OF BEING 
\"PRO-DEMOCRACY\" IN TILT AND U.S.-BACKED.  ADDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S CONSTERNATION, SAWMAR AL-ASAD RECENTLY 
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE EGYPTIAN NEWSPAPER \"AL- 
AHRAM\" ABOUT DEMOCRACY.  WHILE THE ARTICLE DID NOT 
MENTION SYRIA, OUR CONTCT SAID THE SARG CONFISCATED 
THE \"AL-AHRAM\" ISSUES CARRYING SAWMAR\'S ARTICLE.  OUR 
CONTACT ADDED THAT SAWMAR IS STILL OFFICIALLY BANNED 
FROM RETURNING TO SYRIA. 
 
------------------------------------ 
THE PRESIDENT\'S SON-IN-LAW MOVING UP 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) WHILE SPECULATION ABOUT RIF\'AT CONTINUES TO 
VARY, A NUMBER OF EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE REPORTED THAT 
PRESIDENT ASAD RECENTLY APPOINTED HIS SON-IN-LAW, \'ASIF 
SHAWQAT, TO AN IMPORTANT NEW POSITION IN THE SYRIAN 
MILITARY SECURITY APPARATUS.  (COMMENT: SHAWQAT, A 
BRIGADIER GENERAL IN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
(SMI), IS MARRIED TO THE PRESIDENT\'S ONLY DAUGHTER 
BUSHRA, WHO GAVE BIRTH LAST YEAR TO TRIPLETS.  BUSHRA\'S 
LATE BROTHER BASIL REPORTEDLY WAS STRONGLY AGAINST HER 
INVOLVEMENT WITH SHAWQAT, AN OLDER DIVORCEE WITH 
CHILDREN.  IN 1993, BASIL REPORTEDLY HAD SHAWQAT PLACED 
UNDER HOUSE ARREST AND SHAWQAT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS OUSTED 
FROM A SENIOR POSITION IN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
(SMI) AND FORCIBLY RETIRED FROM THE MILITARY.  SHORTLY 
AFTER BASIL\'S DEATH, BUSHRA MARRIED SHAWQAT.  WHILE THE 
PRESIDENT CONSENTED TO THE MATCH, IT IS BELIEVED THAT 
HE WAS DISPLEASED WITH HIS DAUGHTER\'S DECISION. END 
COMMENT.) 
 
9. (C) LOCAL SPECULATION REMAINS SOMEWHAT VAGUE ON THE 
EXACT SCOPE OF SHAWQAT\'S NEW JOB. ACCORDING TO SOME 
CONTACTS, SHAWQAT IS IN CHARGE OF SUPERVISING ARMED 
FORCES SECURITY AND COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE. ACCORDING TO 
OUR SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY CONTACT, SHAWQAT HAS BEEN 
APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF A NEW BRANCH OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE/SECURITY SERVICES, \"AL-AMN AL-QUWAT,\" 
WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER SECURITY SERVICES 
BRANCHES (SMI, STATE SECURITY, POLITICAL SECURITY, 
ETC...)  HE COULD NOT GIVE SPECIFICS ON THE MISSION OF 
THIS NEW SECURITY SERVICE, BEYOND SAYING THAT IT CAN 
INVESTIGATE ANYONE, \"FROM CIVILIANS, TO MILITARY 
OFFICERS, TO THE PRIME MINISTER.\"  OUR CONTACT 
MAINTAINED THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROMOTION FOR 
SHAWQAT, WHO HOLDS THE RANK OF BRIGADIER GENERAL 
(AMID), BECAUSE ALL OF THE DIRECTORS OF OTHER SECURITY 
SERVICES HAVE THE HIGHER RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL (LIWA), 
OR IN THE CASE OF SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA, THE SUPERIOR RANK 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL (IMAD). OUR CONTACT PREDICTED THAT 
SHAWQAT WILL BE PROMOTED TO THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL 
WHEN THE NEXT MILITARY PROMOTION LIST COMES OUT ON 
JULY 1. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) LOCAL SPECULATION ON RIF\'AT\'S STANDING REMAINS 
CONSTANTLY IN FLUX, WITH THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT, 
DESPITE HIS MARGINAL STATUS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, 
RIF\'AT REMAINS A KEY PLAYER IN THE SUCCESSION PICTURE, 
PARTICULARLY AS A POTENTIAL LEADER OF THE ALAWI 
COMMUNITY.  NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT ASAD, MORE THAN 
ANYONE ELSE, SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE NEED TO KEEP A 
TIGHT LID ON RIF\'AT, AND SEEMS UNLIKELY TO MAKE ANY 
CONCILIATORY GESTURES TO RIF\'AT WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE 
THE DELICATE POSITION OF HIS SON BASHAR. AT THE SAME 
TIME HOWEVER, FURTHER ESTRANGING RIF\'AT FROM THE CLAN 
OR TAKING PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST RIF\'AT\'S SONS ALSO 
SEEMS UNLIKELY, AS THIS COULD ENCOURAGE DIVISIONS 
WITHIN THE ALAWI COMMUNITY AND FUEL SPECULATION ON 
REGIME INSTABILITY. 
 
11.  (C) THE REHABILITATION OF \'ASIF SHAWQAT, 
MEANWHILE, SEEMS TO REFLECT A CLOSING OF THE RANKS 
WITHIN THE ASAD FAMILY AND INNER CIRCLE. THE VERY 
AMBIGUITY OF SHAWQAT\'S MISSION PUTS THE ENTIRE SYRIAN 
SECURITY SERVICES ON NOTICE, IN THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
OPENED UP A NEW CHANNEL OF INFORMATION AND ENTRUSTED A 
ONCE-DISGRACED FAMILY MEMBER TO OVERSEE THE JOB. 
PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORTING ON SHAWQAT INDICATES THAT HE 
IS AN ALAWI FROM THE TARTUS AREA, AROUND 50 YEARS OLD, 
AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN FROM HIS PREVIOUS MARRIAGE.  IN 
HIS PREVIOUS POSITION AT SMI, HE WAS REGARDED AS A 
PROTEGE OF SMI CHIEF ALI DUBA AND REPORTEDLY LED A SMI 
UNIT WHICH HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPRESSING THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  HIS APRIL 1993 RETIREMENT WAS 
ALLEGEDLY LINKED TO CORRUPTION CHARGES AND INVOLVEMENT 
IN SMUGGLING AND NARCOTICS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT 
CONFIRMED.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C)  ONE OF OUR CONTACTS WHO SEEMINGLY HAS OPEN CHANNELS

`ABUD, WHO OUR SOURCE SAID WAS ONE OF SYRIA\'S MOST POWERFUL 
MILITARY MEN SIX YEARS AGO (IN CHARGE OF PERSONNEL 
ASSIGNMENTS).  THREE YEARS AGO, HOWEVER, `ABUD WAS STRIPPED 
OF REAL AUTHORITY, AND FINALLY, IN JANUARY, BASHAR ORDERED 
HE BE KICKED OUT OF THE MILITARY COMPLETELY. 
 
-- UP TO A \"DOZEN OFFICERS\" HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE PAST 
TWO MONTHS AT BASHAR\'S BEHEST.  THESE ARRESTS HAD NOTHING TO 
DO WITH THE ATTACKS ON THE EMBASSY, RATHER THEY WERE 
INTENDED TO SHOW INTOLERANCE FOR CORRUPTION (NOTE:  AND 
APPARENTLY TO DEMONSTRATE BASHAR\'S \"TOUGH GUY\" CREDENTIALS). 
AMONG THOSE ARRESTED, THE HEAD OF SMI\'S ADMINISTRATIVE 
MISSIONS OFFICE (IDARAT AL-MUHIMMAT), ANOTHER OFFICER 
IDENTIFIED AS HASAN AL-`ALI (NOTE:  EMBASSY HOLDINGS 
IDENTIFY HIM AS THE COMMANDER OF THE ELECTRONIC WARFARE 
ACADEMY, A REPORT WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH REF A INDICATIONS 
THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN \"REMOVED\" FROM HIS JOB), AND 
ANOTHER OFFICER IDENTIFIED AS H. `ABBAS.  (NOTE:  WE WILL 
ATTEMPT TO INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THESE REPORTS OF ARRESTS.) 
 
-- THE HOUSE DEMOLITIONS (REF B) IN SLUNFE AND YA`FUR WERE 
ENTIRELY BASHAR\'S INITIATIVE. 
 
2.  (C)  ANOTHER SOURCE WITH EXCELLENT CONNECTIONS IN THE 
MILITARY TOLD EMBOFFS JANUARY 13 THAT ALL OF SYRIA\'S SENIOR 
MILITARY LEADERSHIP PAST RETIREMENT AGE (E.G., `ALI DUBA, 
MUSTAFA TALAS), WILL BE REPLACED BY NEXT JULY (IN THE NEXT 
ROUND OF PROMTOIONS/RETIREMENTS).  OUR SOURCE SAID THE 
CHANGES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND UNPARALLELED.   HE SAID 
THAT, ALTHOUGH ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF `ALI `ASLAN HAD BEEN 
GRANTED AN EXTENSION, HE TOO WOULD BE GONE BY JULY.  THIS 
SOURCE SAID THERE HAD BEEN GREAT SURPRISE (AMONG THE 
MILITARY) AT THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO WERE 
FORCED OUT THIS ROUND, AND IMPLIED IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE 
NOT A GOOD FIT WITH BASHAR. 
 
LEADERSHIP\'S ECONOMIC BLINDERS 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) OUR FIRST CONTACT ALSO CONFIRMED OUR LONG-HELD 
SUSPICION THAT THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP HAS NO REAL SENSE OF 
THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT, PARTLY 
PRODDED BY DISCUSSIONS WITH ECONCHIEF (ABOUT THE EMBASSY\'S 
DRAFT REPORT ON SYRIA\'S ECONOMY IN 1997/98), HE APPROACHED 
SENIOR \"POLITICAL\" FIGURES (NOTE:  USUALLY BASHAR) TO 
COMPLAIN THAT SARG DATA IS NOT A COGENT BASIS FOR ECONOMIC 
ANALYSIS.  HE WAS APPARENTLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE 
HIS CASE ON THIS POINT AND PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR 
IMPROVEMENT.  THE CONTACT ALSO SAID HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO 
PROVIDE FURTHER DATA TO ENHANCE THE DRAFT EMBASSY REPORT. 
(COMMENT:  WHILE WORTH PURSUING, WE EXPECT SARG STONEWALLING 
IF WE REQUEST INFORMATION ON MILITARY EXPENDITURES, OIL 
INCOME, OR OFFICIAL RESERVES.) 
 
4.  (C)  THE PREVIOUS DAY, THE CONTACT HAD ADVISED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE UMBRAGE AT THE EMBASSY\'S 
(UNCLASSIFIED) ANALYSIS, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SEEN AS AN 
\"OFFICIAL\" CRITICISM OF SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.  SHE 
PROTESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST UNDERSTAND THAT EMBASSIES 
ARE EXPECTED TO PREPARE A BARE MINIMUM OF OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC 
REPORTING -- AND SAID SHE HAD MADE VERY CLEAR TO SARG 
CONTACTS THAT SHE WOULD CONSIDER AMENDING HER REPORT IF THEY 
AGREED TO BACK UP THEIR ASSERTIONS WITH HARD DATA.  OUR 
CONTACT SHOOK HIS HEAD, SAYING \"THE SARG DOES NOT UNDERSTAND 
THAT ANY BUSINESSMEN OR ACADEMIC WOULD HAVE ANY NEED FOR 
SUCH REPORTS.\"  ECONCHIEF PERSISTED, WONDERING HOW THE SARG 
COULD FEIGN DISPLEASURE WHEN MOST OF SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC 
SHORTCOMINGS (AND ITS STATISTICAL REPORTING) WERE 
HIGHLIGHTED EACH YEAR IN THE IMF\'S ARTICLE IV REPORT.  HE 
LAUGHED AT OUR NAIVETE AND SAID THAT THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP 
MAKES NO EFFORT TO READ, MUCH LESS UNDERSTAND, THE IMF 
REPORTS, WHICH WERE TOO LONG.  GETTING THEIR ATTENTION FOR 
HIS OWN ENDEAVOR, THEREFORE, HE FELT, WAS SOMETHING OF A 
MIRACLE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) HAFIZ AL-ASAD\'S EFFORT TO PREPARE SON BASHAR TO 
ASSUME EVENTUALLY THE PRESIDENCY IS INCREASINGLY THE 
PRISM THROUGH WHICH POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE VIEWED 
AND INTERPRETED.  THE PROSPECTS FOR A SMOOTH 
SUCCESSION ARE A DIRECT FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH TIME ASAD 
HAS -- AND HOW MUCH APTITUDE BASHAR SHOWS.  GIVEN HIS 
AGE AND HEALTH, PRESIDENT ASAD COULD DIE AT ANY TIME; 
HIS EARLY DEPARTURE WOULD LIKELY REVIVE THE LONG- 
DORMANT STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN SYRIA.  ELDEST SON 
BASHAR IS FAR FROM A SURE BET TO FOLLOW IN HIS 
FATHER\'S FOOTSTEPS, AND, IN ANY CASE, WOULD NEVER 
ENJOY HIS FATHER\'S ABSOLUTE GRIP ON POWER.  VICE- 
PRESIDENT KHADDAM WOULD LIKELY HAVE A KEY ROLE IN 
SUCCESSION.  ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, MULTIPLE POWER 
CENTERS ARE LIKELY TO EMERGE.  AS THE INTERNAL POWER 
STRUGGLE DEVELOPS, THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP\'S PRIMARY 
FOCUS WILL BE ON CONSOLIDATING POWER.  WHILE THE 
STRUGGLE WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE VIOLENT, THE 
TRANSITION FROM ASAD\'S RULE COULD HAVE NEGATIVE 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR U.S. INTERESTS IN A COMPREHENSIVE 
REGIONAL PEACE, WMD, COUNTER-TERRORISM AND IRAQ.  ON 
THE OTHER HAND, THE U.S. COULD FIND SOME OPPORTUNITIES 
TO ADVANCE ITS OBJECTIVES IN THE COMING MONTHS, AS 
ASAD FOCUSES INCREASINGLY ON THE LEGACY HE WILL LEAVE 
HIS SON BASHAR -- INCLUDING POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF 
PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL AND IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH 
HIS NEIGHBORS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) THIS MESSAGE RESPONDS TO REF A TASKING, WHICH 
SOUGHT POST\'S VIEWS ON HOST COUNTRY SUCCESSION ISSUES. 
THE HEADERS BELOW TRACK WITH THOSE IN THE TASKING. 
 
---------------------------- 
TRANSITION LIKELIHOOD/TIMING 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (C) GIVEN PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD\'S AGE (I.E., 
OFFICIALLY 69 AND POSSIBLY OLDER, REF B) AND HEALTH 
CONCERNS (I.E., HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES) A 
SUCCESSION COULD REALISTICALLY TAKE PLACE AT ANY TIME 
AND POSSIBLY WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME OF HIS JUST-STARTED 
SEVEN-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE.  THERE ARE ALSO INDICATIONS 
THAT ASAD\'S MENTAL ACUITY AND ATTENTIVENESS ARE BEING 
GRADUALLY ERODED BY THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF AGE AND 
DISEASE.  PERVASIVE SECURITY IN SYRIA HAS MADE IT 
DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT 
POWERBASES.  THEREFORE, IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERMS, 
A CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION, BY PROVIDING 
ORGANIZATIONAL TIME, WOULD LIKELY SERVE THE INTERESTS 
OF THOSE WHO MAY BE INCLINED TO OR BE POSITIONED FOR A 
GRAB FOR POWER.  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE AND PERHAPS 
LIKELY THAT THE SUCCESSION WILL PLAY OUT INITIALLY IN 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS, EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL 
SCENARIOS, INCLUDING COUPS AND COUNTER-COUPS, CANNOT 
BE RULED OUT. 
 
--------------------- 
POTENTIAL NEW LEADERS 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) SYRIAN SUCCESSION IS CURRENTLY CLOUDED BY THE 
PASSING FROM THE SCENE OF MANY ASAD-GENERATION 
POWERBROKERS AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW LEADERS FROM 
WITHIN A POWER STRUCTURE WITH WHICH WESTERNERS HAVE 
LITTLE OR NO CONTACT.  IN THE NEARER TERM AT LEAST, IF 
ASAD DIES IN OFFICE OR BECOMES PERMANENTLY 
INCAPACITATED, THE FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT WILL PLAY A 
KEY ROLE.  ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, IN SUCH 
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT ABD AL-HALIM 
KHADDAM, HOLDS FULL PRESIDENTIAL POWERS FOR UP TO 90 
DAYS, DURING WHICH TIME A PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM MUST 
TAKE PLACE.  IN THIS PERIOD, THE BA\'TH PARTY WOULD 
RECOMMEND A CANDIDATE TO THE PARLIAMENT WHICH 
\"DEBATES\" THE CANDIDACY AND THEN VOTES ON WHETHER THE 
CANDIDATE\'S NAME WILL MOVE FORWARD TO THE FINAL STEP 
OF A NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  (NB:  UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION, ASAD CAN DESIGNATE A NEW FIRST VICE- 
PRESIDENT AT ANY TIME.) 
 
5. (C) BEHIND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, HOWEVER, THE 
ALAWI-DOMINATED MILITARY AND SECURITY SERVICES WILL 
PLAY THE KEY ROLE AND LIKELY DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF 
SUCCESSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SENIOR BA\'TH PARTY 
LEADERSHIP (I.E., THE 20-MEMBER REGIONAL COMMAND, 
WHICH HAS MILITARY REPRESENTATION).  THE SERVICES ARE 
THE PRIMARY PILLAR OF THE ASAD REGIME, FOLLOWED IN 
DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE BY THE BA\'TH PARTY, 
GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT, GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE SUNNI MERCHANT 
CLASS. 
 
6. (C) COLONEL BASHAR AL-ASAD:  PRESIDENT ASAD APPEARS 
TO BE BETTING THAT HIS FINAL TERM IN OFFICE WILL ALLOW 
SUFFICIENT TIME FOR AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO POWER FOR 
HIS SON BASHAR.  IF ASAD MAKES IT THROUGH HIS SEVEN 
YEAR TERM, BASHAR WILL HAVE REACHED THE 
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED PRESIDENTIAL AGE OF 40.  THE 
TRANSITION EFFORT BEGAN IN EARNEST OVER THE LAST YEAR, 
AS WITNESSED MOST DRAMATICALLY IN THE MILITARY- 
SECURITY SERVICES, THROUGH A DECISION TO MINIMIZE 
CAREER EXTENSIONS AT RANK, THUS ALLOWING FOR INCREASED 
MILITARY RETIREMENTS.  RETIRED OFFICERS, INCLUDING 
SOME REGIME HEAVYWEIGHTS, ARE BEING REPLACED WITH 
YOUNGER ONES BELIEVED TO BE LOYAL OR AT LEAST NOT A 
THREAT TO BASHAR.  BASHAR IS ALSO INCREASINGLY BEING 
POSITIONED AS A SYRIAN STATESMAN, HOLDING SEPARATE 
HIGH-PROFILE MEETINGS WITH LEBANESE OFFICIALS, 
JORDANIAN KING \'ABDULLAH AND, MOST RECENTLY, IRANIAN 
PRESIDENT KHATAMI. 
 
7. (C) ASSUMING THE MILITARY TRANSITION IS MOVING 
REASONABLY WELL, ASAD WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE PARALLEL 
CHANGES IN THE SENIOR BA\'TH PARTY MEMBERSHIP.  ONLY 
AFTER THESE TWO STEPS ARE SUCCESSFULLY UNDERWAY WOULD 
ASAD MOVE TO CONSIDER CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER CHANGES 
TO ALLOW FOR BASHAR TO ASSUME A VICE-PRESIDENCY OR AN 
OUTRIGHT EARLY ASSUMPTION OF POWER.  THE SUCCESS OF 
THIS SCENARIO IS PREDICATED UPON ASAD HAVING THE TIME 
AND HEALTH TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS AND ON 
BASHAR\'S ABILITY TO SEIZE ON THE HEAD START HIS FATHER 
IS ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE. 
 
8. (C) FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT ABD AL-HALIM KHADDAM: 
WITH THE DEPARTURE OF CHIEF-OF-STAFF HIKMAT AL- 
SHIHABI, VP KHADDAM (67) REMAINS ARGUABLY THE MOST 
TRUSTED SUNNI IN THE ASAD REGIME.  THERE IS MUCH TALK 
AND SOME EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF KHADDAM\'S PORTFOLIOS -- 
E.G. LEBANON -- ARE GRADUALLY BEING TRANSFERRED TO 
BASHAR.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE BELIEVE KHADDAM STILL 
HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE CLOSED CIRCLE AROUND THE 
PRESIDENT.  AS LONG AS KHADDAM REMAINS FIRST VICE- 
PRESIDENT, HE ENJOYS PRIDE OF PLACE IN ANY 
CONSTITUTIONAL SUCCESSION SCENARIO.  KHADDAM HAS NO 
INDEPENDENT POWER BASE, AND HIS THINKING PROBABLY 
ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY WITH ASAD\'S AND WITH THE MILITARY- 
SECURITY LEADERSHIP.  VARIOUS SOURCES INDICATE KHADDAM 
MIGHT BE OPEN TO ECONOMIC REFORM BUT, ON THE OTHER 
HAND, HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY HARD-LINE ON THE 
PEACE PROCESS. 
 
9. (C) KHADDAM, THEREFORE, COULD FULFILL SEVERAL ROLES 
FROM A 90-DAY OVERSEER OF TRANSITION TO A TRANSITIONAL 
PRESIDENT IN A QUASI-COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP SCENARIO. 
COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP IN POST-INDEPENDENCE SYRIA HAS 
USUALLY SERVED AS A PERIOD FOR THE EMERGENCE OF 
MULTIPLE POWER CENTERS VYING FOR DOMINANCE.  HISTORY 
MAY WELL REPEAT ITSELF.  IF ASAD\'S DEATH TAKES PLACE 
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, KHADDAM MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
FINISH OUT ASAD\'S SUCCESSION PLANS FOR BASHAR, 
ASSUMING BASHAR HAD RISEN TO THE OCCASION.  IF NOT, 
ALAWI POWERBROKERS MAY ALREADY HAVE BEGUN LOOKING AT 
ALTERNATIVES IN WHOM TO ENTRUST THEIR FUTURE. 
 
10. (C) BG \'ASIF SHAWQAT:  ONE OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES 
MAY BE PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW SHAWQAT (53).  AN 
ALAWI, SHAWQAT MIGHT WELL BE CALLED THE COMEBACK 
PLAYER OF THE REGIME.  HE WAS ONCE ONE OF SMI CHIEF 
LTG \'ALI DUBA\'S MOST TRUSTED SUBORDINATES, BUT FELL 
FROM GRACE AND WAS ACTUALLY RETIRED AND IMPRISONED 
(1993), SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF REPORTED DEALINGS IN 
SMUGGLING AND NARCOTICS, BUT MORE LIKELY BECAUSE ASAD 
DID NOT APPROVE OF SHAWQAT\'S PLANS TO MARRY HIS ONLY 
DAUGHTER BUSHRA.  THE SHAWQATS HAVE SINCE PROVIDED 
PRESIDENT ASAD WITH HIS ONLY GRANDCHILDREN AND ALL 
APPEARS TO BE FORGIVEN.  SHAWQAT HOLDS A SHADOWY BUT 
POWERFUL POSITION AS HEAD OF AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY 
SERVICE THAT CAN INVESTIGATE ANYONE, \"FROM CIVILIANS 
TO MILITARY OFFICERS TO THE PRIME MINISTER.\"  OUR SLIM 
HOLDINGS ON THIS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT PLAYER INDICATE 
THAT SHAWQAT IS TOUGH, EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT, WELL- 
READ, QUIET AND A SELF-STARTER.  HE OBVIOUSLY ALSO HAD 
THE MOXIE TO STAND UP TO ASAD HIMSELF AND FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON HIS MARRIAGE TO BUSHRA.  IF HE CAN ALSO 
STILL COUNT ON \'ALI DUBA\'S SUPPORT, IT WOULD BE 
ANOTHER PLUS, BUT THIS MAY BE DOUBTFUL SINCE HE HAS 
EMERGED AS A RIVAL TO DUBA\'S LONG-TIME DOMINANCE OF 
SMI.  HE IS ALSO REPORTED TO COME FROM A RELATIVELY 
MINOR \'ALAWI FAMILY/CLAN, WHICH MEANS HE CANNOT 
AUTOMATICALLY COMMAND A STRONG \'ALAWI SUPPORT BASE. 
 
11. (C) RIF\'AT AL-ASAD:  BLACK SHEEP PRESIDENTIAL 
BROTHER RIF\'AT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED A LONG SHOT, BUT 
HIS NAME AND TOUGH-GUY REPUTATION STILL RESONATE WITH 
MANY ALAWIS.  HE IS ALSO AMBITIOUS, NOT ONLY FOR 
HIMSELF BUT FOR HIS SONS.  MANY OF OUR CONTACTS, WHILE 
DISCOUNTING HIS CURRENT INFLUENCE IN SYRIA AND IN THE 
\'ALAWITE COMMUNITY, NEVERTHELESS WILL SAY THAT HE 
CANNOT BE COMPLETELY COUNTED OUT IN ANY SUCCESSION 
SCENARIO.  SUNNIS, HOWEVER, REVILE HIM FOR HIS ROLE IN 
THE HAMA/ALEPPO MASSACRES OF THE EARLY 80\'S.  HE IS A 
SYMBOL OF DIVISIVENESS, ETHNIC CONFLICT AND 
REPRESSION.  RIF\'AT\'S FORTUNES COULD NEVERTHELESS 
IMPROVE IF ALAWI SUPREMACY APPEARED THREATENED AND THE 
NEED FOR A HEAVY HAND WAS FELT AND, PARTICULARLY, IF 
SUCCESSION OCCURRED EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER AND 
BASHAR WAS NOT DEEMED READY.  RIF\'AT HIMSELF IS 
PLAINLY STILL INTERESTED IN LEADING SYRIA AFTER ASAD\'S 
DEMISE.  HE REPORTEDLY MADE THE HAJJ THIS YEAR, WHICH 
WAS SEEN AS A MOCKERY BY SUNNIS HERE, AND HE IS AN IN- 
LAW OF SAUDI CROWN PRINCE \'ABDULLAH. 
 
12. (C) MAJOR MAHIR AL-ASAD (33):  WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE FOR 
THE RECORD THAT THE NAME OF ASAD\'S PENULTIMATE SON IS BEING 
HEARD INCREASINGLY AROUND DAMASCUS.  HE IS DESCRIBED 
ALTERNATELY AS MORE LIKE HIS FATHER (THAN BASHAR) OR LIKE 
HIS UNCLE RIF\'AT.  THE BANDYING ABOUT OF MAHIR\'S NAME MAY 
BE AN INDICATION OF DISSATISFACTION WITH BASHAR\'S PROGRESS 
TO DATE. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
U.S. INTERACTION/BACKGROUND ON U.S. CONTACTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) WE HAVE MADE ANY NUMBER OF ULTIMATELY 
UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, INCLUDING DIRECT REQUESTS BY 
DIPLOMATIC NOTE, TO MEET WITH THE MILITARY/SECURITY 
AND BA\'TH PARTY PERSONALITIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO 
DETERMINE AND BE A PART OF SYRIA\'S SUCCESSION, 
INCLUDING BASHAR.  IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT THESE KEY 
PERSONALITIES ARE OFF LIMITS TO OFFICIAL USG CONTACTS 
AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OUR INFORMATION TENDS TO COME FROM 
SECONDARY SOURCES.  FOR THEIR PART, OTHER THAN 
OCCASIONAL PRIVATE VISITS TO THE U.S., THESE 
INDIVIDUALS ALSO AVOID OFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH U.S. 
REPRESENTATIVES EXCEPT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. 
MOREOVER, THOSE IN THE MILITARY/SECURITY HIERARCHY 
LIKELY VIEW U.S. MOTIVES WITH SUSPICION AND AS A 
POTENTIAL THREAT.  AS WE HAVE SEEN, THE SECURITY 
APPARATUS HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO SYRIA\'S 
ACQUISITION OF CELL PHONE AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY.  IT 
IS INSTRUCTIVE THAT WHILE THE PRESIDENT\'S SON MAY BE 
THE MOST WESTERN-EDUCATED OF SUCCESSOR CANDIDATES, 
THIS FACT MAY ACTUALLY WORK AGAINST HIS SUCCESS IN THE 
SYRIAN CONTEXT. 
 
-------------------- 
THREATS TO STABILITY 
-------------------- 
 
14. (C) INTERNAL:  THE PRIMARY THREAT TO STABILITY IS 
INTERNAL, WITH A BREAKDOWN OF \'ALAWI COHESION AND THE 
ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH AND WITH SUPPORTIVE SUNNIS 
BEING PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS POSSIBILITY.  HISTORY 
SUGGESTS THAT A POWER STRUGGLE COULD DEVELOP AMONG 
SENIOR ELEMENTS OF THE SARG, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT\'S 
FAMILY.  HAFIZ AL-ASAD HAS RULED IN DAMASCUS LONGER 
THAN ANY LEADER SINCE MU\'AWIYAH FOUNDED THE UMMAYAD 
DYNASTY IN 661, BUT HE IS VERY MUCH THE EXCEPTION IN 
SYRIAN POLITICS.  ACCORDING TO ONE HISTORIAN, THE 
PERIOD FROM SYRIA\'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1946 UNTIL ASAD 
SEIZED POWER IN 1970 WAS MARKED BY \"ONE OF THE WORLD\'S 
HIGHEST RECORDS FOR MILITARY PUTSCHES AND COUPS.\" 
WHILE DESTABILIZING, MOST OF THESE COUPS WERE, 
FORTUNATELY, RELATIVELY BLOODLESS WITH VIOLENCE 
CONFINED TO THE PLAYERS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE 
SUPPORTERS. 
 
15. (C) IF AMBITION AND SELF-INTEREST CAN BE BALANCED 
AND CONTAINED THROUGH BACKROOM NEGOTIATIONS, 
COLLECTIVE SUPPORT OF A SUITABLE CANDIDATE AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS, STABILITY WILL BE LARGELY 
PRESERVED.  INDEED, THE QUICK ATTAINMENT OF A NEW 
POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM WILL PROBABLY BE THE KEY TO 
SYRIA\'S INTERNAL STABILITY.  IF SYRIA\'S TRANSITION 
LEADERS FAIL IN THIS REGARD, THE POST INDEPENDENCE 
HISTORY OUTLINED ABOVE SUGGESTS THAT ANY EXTRA- 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWER STRUGGLE OR COUP WOULD BE 
RELATIVELY QUICK AND CONFINED BUT PRONE TO REPETITION 
UNTIL A NEW POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM WERE REACHED. 
 
16. (C) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND SUNNI-\'ALAWI FRICTION: 
A SUCCESSION THAT IS NOT SETTLED QUICKLY COULD BE SEEN 
BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) (REF C) OR OTHER 
INTERNAL ACTORS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE REGIME, 
FURTHER COMPLICATING THE SUCCESSION.  THE SARG-MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD ENCOUNTERS OF THE 70S-80S PROVIDED THE 
ONLY WIDESPREAD CIVIL CONFLICT IN RECENT SYRIAN 
HISTORY.  ASAD BIOGRAPHER PATRICK SEALE HAS POINTED 
OUT THIS STRUGGLE WAS MORE THAN A SECULAR-ISLAMIST 
CONFRONTATION, \"BEHIND THE IMMEDIATE CONTEST LAY THE 
OLD MULTI-LAYERED HOSTILITY BETWEEN ISLAM AND THE 
BA\'TH, BETWEEN SUNNI AND \'ALAWI, BETWEEN TOWN AND 
COUNTRY.\"  WHILE THE MB UPRISING WAS UTTERLY CRUSHED, 
THE CAUSATIVE ISSUES ARE STILL PRESENT AND THE MB 
ITSELF LIKELY HAS MANY CLOSET SYMPATHIZERS IN SYRIA. 
MOREOVER, THE BRUTAL 1982 EXTERMINATION OF UP TO 
25,000 SUNNIS AT HAMA BY (MAINLY) \'ALAWIS IS FOREVER 
SEARED IN THE MEMORY OF MOST SUNNIS AND IS A 
CONTINUING OBSTACLE TO RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE 
MAJORITY SUNNIS AND THE \'ALAWI-CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT. 
BEYOND THE MB, OTHER INTERNAL THREATS COULD APPEAR IN 
A POWER VACUUM SUCH AS A RISE IN SYRIAN KURDISH 
NATIONALISM OR THE FRACTURE OF SOCIETY ALONG ECONOMIC- 
SOCIAL LINES. 
 
17. (C) THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY COULD BE ANOTHER 
ISSUE COMPLICATING SUCCESSION.  THE SARG HAS BEEN ABLE 
TO MAINTAIN AN OVERALL STANDARD OF LIVING THAT, WHILE 
ERODING, KEEPS THE POPULACE PACIFIED IF NOT HAPPY.  IF 
THE SARG CANNOT MAINTAIN THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF 
LIVING FOR SYRIANS, POPULAR DISCONTENT COULD PROVIDE A 
MORE VOLATILE ATMOSPHERE FOR SUCCESSION.  IT IS NOT 
HARD TO ENVISION A SCENARIO IN WHICH ISLAMISTS TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF A DISTRACTED SARG AND ECONOMIC UNREST TO 
PROMOTE VIOLENT CHANGE.  IN THIS SITUATION \'ALAWIS AND 
SECULARIST SUNNI\'S WOULD FIND ALLIES AMONG BOTH THE 
DRUZE AND VARIOUS CHRISTIAN GROUPS WHO WOULD ALL FEEL 
THEIR INTERESTS THREATENED BY AN MB RESURGENCE. 
LONGER-TERM STABILITY IS THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT 
MOST SYRIANS FEEL LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THEIR 
GOVERNMENT.  IF THERE IS RESIDUAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
REGIME THAT ACTS AS A STABILIZING FACTOR, IT IS 
THROUGH THE PERSONALITY AND RECOGNIZED STATURE OF 
HAFIZ AL-ASAD.  NEITHER BASHAR NOR OTHER CONTENDERS 
WILL HAVE THIS SUPPORT. 
 
18. (C) EXTERNAL:  IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, A DRAWN- 
OUT SUCCESSION ALSO RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVES BY 
EXTERNAL ACTORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH 
INTERNAL UNREST.  THE PERIOD FROM SYRIA\'S INDEPENDENCE 
UNTIL ASAD TOOK POWER WAS ALSO NOTABLE FOR THE 
PERVASIVENESS OF EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON THE 
PERENNIALLY STRUGGLING GOVERNMENT.  IN THE 50S, IRAQ, 
EGYPT, LEBANON, JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ALL MEDDLED 
ACTIVELY IN SYRIAN AFFAIRS.  NURI SAID\'S IRAQ SOUGHT 
UNION; EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA SOUGHT INFLUENCE; AND 
KING \'ABDULLAH OF JORDAN ENVISIONED A HASHEMITE- 
DOMINATED GREATER SYRIA, EVEN LEBANON HAD A HAND, 
THROUGH THE MACHINATIONS OF THE LEBANESE-BASED 
LEADERSHIP OF THE SYRIAN SOCIALIST NATIONALIST PARTY 
(SSNP) -- THE MAIN RIVAL FOR INFLUENCE TO THE BA\'TH 
PARTY AMONG SECULAR NATIONALISTS IN SYRIA UNTIL 1955. 
BRITAIN, FRANCE, THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET 
UNION ALSO COMPETED FOR INFLUENCE AS SYRIAN 
GOVERNMENTS CAME AND WENT IN RAPID SUCCESSION. 
WESTERN PRESSURE TO JOIN THE BAGHDAD PACT BACKFIRED, 
DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY AND EVENTUALLY CATALYZING A 
HASTY UNION WITH EGYPT, WHICH IN TURN OPENED THE DOOR 
TO INCREASED SOVIET INFLUENCE. 
 
19. (C) BECAUSE OF SYRIA\'S STRATEGIC GEOPOLITICAL 
POSITION, IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH A 
TURBULENT STATE OF AFFAIRS COULD RECUR.  IN A 
PROLONGED SUCCESSION STRUGGLE, SYRIAN ISLAMISTS MIGHT 
BE EMBOLDENED BY ASSISTANCE FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES 
RANGING FROM SAUDI ARABIA TO USAMA BIN LADIN; IRAQ 
MIGHT SEEK INFLUENCE THROUGH ITS BA\'THIST CONNECTIONS 
OR SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THROUGH INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS 
AND SABOTAGE; AND SOME LEBANESE ACTORS COULD ALSO SEE 
A WEAKENED AND DESTABILIZED SYRIA AS THE KEY TO 
REVERSING DECADES OF STRONG INFLUENCE IN LEBANESE 
AFFAIRS BY DAMASCUS.  MOREOVER, SYRIA\'S OPEN DOOR TO 
FELLOW ARABS -- NO ARAB NEEDS A VISA TO SYRIA -- COULD 
BECOME A LIABILITY.  OFTEN DESCRIBED AS \"CARDS\" TO BE 
PLAYED, THE PRESENCE OF 366,000 PALESTINIANS 
(INCLUDING MANY REJECTIONIST GROUPS), IRAQI KURDS, AND 
OTHER ELEMENTS COULD BECOME SOURCES OF INSTABILITY 
INSTEAD, ESPECIALLY AS LINKS TO OUTSIDE AGENTS OF 
INFLUENCE.  NOT LEAST, THE THREE NON-ARAB REGIONAL 
POWERS -- TURKEY, ISRAEL AND IRAN -- ALL CONSIDER THAT 
THEY HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY EQUITIES IN SYRIA, AND ALL 
HAVE SOME CAPACITY FOR AFFECTING SYRIAN AFFAIRS. 
 
-------------- 
U.S. INTERESTS 
-------------- 
 
20. (C) IN A SUCCESSION/TRANSITION PERIOD (AS WE HAVE 
BEGUN TO SEE) SYRIAN LEADERS\' FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE 
REGIME SURVIVAL AND CONSOLIDATION OF POWER.  IN THE 
SYRIAN CONTEXT, THIS WILL NOT BE A PERIOD FOR NEW 
THINKING OR TAKING RISKS, BUT FOR CONSERVATIVE 
ADHERENCE TO LONG-STANDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES. 
CONSEQUENTLY, SUCCESSION PARTICULARLY, IN THE SHORT 
AND MEDIUM TERM, IS NOT LIKELY TO BRING POSITIVE 
SYRIAN MOVEMENT ON KEY U.S. INTERESTS SUCH AS 
CONCLUDING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL PEACE; CONTROLLING 
WMD; COUNTERING TERRORISM OR ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
WHAT CAN THE U.S. DO NOW?:  U.S. ACTIONS/TIMELINE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
21. (C) IF SUCCESSION IS UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE A SYRIAN 
GOVERNMENT READY TO UNDERTAKE BOLD INITIATIVES, IT MAY 
BE THAT THE PERIOD PRIOR TO TRANSITION OFFERS 
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT 
ASAD DOES NOT WANT TO HAND OVER A COUNTRY WHICH HAS 
ADVERSARIAL RELATIONS WITH ALL OF ITS NEIGHBORS.  WITH 
THIS POSSIBILITY AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN ISRAEL IN 
MIND, THE U.S. MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE ITS 
OBJECTIVES OVER THE COMING MONTHS, AS HAFIZ AL-ASAD 
FOCUSES ON PREPARING FOR THE SUCCESSION IN SYRIA.  THE 
PEACE PROCESS IS ONE OBVIOUS AREA.  IT MAY BE SOME 
TIME BEFORE ANOTHER SYRIAN LEADER WOULD BE ABLE TO 
CONSOLIDATE HIS POSITION SUFFICIENTLY TO CONCLUDE AND 
IMPLEMENT A PEACE AGREEMENT.  CONCLUDING A 
COMPREHENSIVE PEACE WOULD OPEN ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO 
ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS ON COUNTER-TERRORISM AND WMD. 
ON IRAQ, SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR CURRENT UN POLICIES IS 
MAINTAINED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FELT NEED TO INSIST ON 
IMPLEMENTATION OF UN RESOLUTIONS SO THAT SYRIA CAN 
SIMILARLY INSIST THAT ISRAEL RESPECT UN RESOLUTIONS. 
A NEW REGIME MAY BE LESS DISCIPLINED IN THIS REGARD 
THAN ASAD\'S SYRIA, AND THUS MORE LIKELY TO BE SWAYED 
BY THE MOOD OF THE ARAB STREET AND THE PERCEIVED 
SUFFERING OF IRAQIS UNDER UN SANCTIONS.

LOYALIST, PROBED US ON HOW THE U.S. VIEWED THE HEIR- 
APPARENT AND SEEMED INTENT ON HEARING ABOUT HOW TO 
IMPROVE BASHAR\'S IMAGE WITH THE U.S.  IF THE INTERVIEW 
COMES OFF, IT MAY SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF A SARG- 
ORCHESTRATED \"SELL JOB\" OF BASHAR TO THE WEST, AND TO 
THE U.S. IN PARTICULAR.  MEANWHILE, RUMORS INDICATE THAT 
BASHAR STILL FACES SOME INTERNAL OBSTACLES, POSSIBLY 
AMONG ALAWIS.  WE SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE 
IMPORTANCE OF OUR POSTURE ON BASHAR IN THE MONTHS TO 
COME.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MEI INTERVIEW WITH BASHAR? 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) AN AMERICAN-BASED, SYRIAN BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE 
TIES TO BASHAR AL-ASAD TOLD US AUGUST 5 THAT PRESIDENT 
ASAD HAD GIVEN HIS APPROVAL FOR BASHAR TO BE INTERVIEWED 
BY MIDDLE EAST INSIGHT (MEI) MAGAZINE, FOR THE SEPTEMBER 
ISSUE.  THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST INTERVIEW GRANTED BY 
BASHAR TO A WESTERN PUBLICATION, ALTHOUGH A LENGTHY 
INTERVIEW WITH THE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER AL-KIFAH AL-\'ARABI 
APPEARED IN FEBRUARY (REF B).  ACCORDING TO THIS 
BUSINESS CONTACT, WHO STATED CREDIBLY THAT HE HAD MET 
WITH BASHAR DURING THE PRECEEDING WEEK, IT HAD BEEN 
AGREED WITH MEI THAT THE QUESTIONS WOULD BE SUBMITTED IN 
ADVANCE AND THAT THE INTERVIEW WOULD BE APPROVED BY THE 
SARG BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION. 
 
3. (C) THIS CONTACT, A BASHAR LOYALIST WHO SAYS HE WOULD 
RETURN TO WORK FOR THE SARG UNDER BASHAR\'S DIRECTION, 
SAID THAT ASAD IS LOOKING FOR \"CERTAIN CONTROLLED 
ENVIRONMENTS\" IN WHICH TO INCREASE HIS SON\'S EXPOSURE 
AND STATURE.  WHILE THIS CONTACT REMAINS CONCERNED THAT 
SYRIA LACKS THE FORWARD-THINKING TECHNO-AND BUREAUCRATS 
NEEDED TO EFFECT CHANGE HERE (REF A), HE SEEMS CONVINCED 
THAT BASHAR PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE 
OPEN AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM. 
 
BASHAR NEEDS U.S. BLESSING 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) DURING OUR EXCHANGE, THIS CONTACT ASKED AS 
BLATANTLY AS WE HAVE HEARD THUS FAR HOW THE U.S. VIEWED 
BASHAR, AND ASKED FOR OUR ADVICE ON WAYS BASHAR\'S IMAGE 
COULD BE PROMOTED IN THE U.S.  WE ANSWERED THAT A 
CONSIDERED OPINION WAS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE FEW AMERICANS 
HAD EVER MET HIM, MUCH LESS EVALUATED HIM AS A FUTURE 
PRESIDENT.  HE ASKED FOR OUR OPINION ON THE UPCOMING MEI 
INTERVIEW, WHICH WE SAID WOULD BE USEFUL (AS WALID 
MU\'ALLIM\'S HAD BEEN) IF IT PROVIDED \"REAL QUESTIONS AND 
REAL ANSWERS,\" AND NOT OBVIOUSLY PRE-PACKAGED 
STATEMENTS. 
 
A LEGITIMACY \"VACUUM\" 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) SEVERAL PRO-BASHAR AND/OR U.S-LEANING 
INTERLOCUTORS HAVE INQUIRED MORE SUBTLY THAN THIS 
ARTICULATE BUSINESS CONTACT ABOUT U.S. VIEWS TOWARD THE 
HEIR APPARENT, APPARENTLY LOOKING FOR POSITIVE SIGNALS 
FROM US ABOUT OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.  A 
FORMER MP WHO MAINTAINS REGULAR CONTACT WITH US AND THE 
BRITISH EMBASSY EXPANDED ON THE THEME IN A RECENT 
CONVERSATION.  HE SAID THE REGIME IS CLEARLY WORRIED 
ABOUT A \"VACUUM IN LEGITIMACY\" AFTER AN ANTICIPATED 
PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL, SINCE SO MUCH OF ASAD\'S 
INTERNAL AUTHORITY AND INTERNATIONAL STANDING STEMS FROM 
THE CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL.  IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS 
CRUTCH, ASAD IS INTENT ON SECURING FOR BASHAR THE KIND 
OF SUPPORT THAT JORDANIAN KING ABDULLAH RECEIVED FROM 
THE U.S. AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER.  SUCH SUPPORT 
WOULD WIN FINANCIAL GAINS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY FOR THE NEW BASHAR REGIME, 
AMELIORATING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL THREATS. 
 
STILL LACKING SOME CREDENTIALS 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) MEANWHILE, CONTACTS INDICATE WITHOUT ELABORATING 
THAT BASHAR STILL FACES SOME RESISTANCE AMONG THE ALAWI 
ELITE, SOME OF WHOM DOUBT THAT BASHAR IS CAPABLE OF 
MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM THAT HAS LONG BENEFITED THIS 
RULING MINORITY. (INTERESTINGLY, CHRISTIANS AND MOST 
OTHER RELIGIOUS MINORITIES HAVE EXPRESSED OPEN SUPPORT 
FOR BASHAR IN THE FERVENT HOPE THAT HE WILL MAINTAIN 
ASAD\'S \"LIVE AND LET LIVE\" APPROACH TOWARDS MINORITY 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS.)  WHILE IT IS NO LONGER TABOO TO SPEAK 
OPENLY ABOUT BASHAR AS A SUCCESSOR TO HIS FATHER, EVEN 
SUPPORTERS FRET THAT HE STILL LACKS A TITLE AND AN 
OFFICIAL PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT/PARTY STRUCTURE.  THE 
COMMON WISDOM IS THAT A REGIONAL COMMAND MEETING 
SOMETIME IN THE FALL WILL FINALLY ELECT BASHAR INTO THE 
BA\'TH PARTY LEADERSHIP, BUT PREPARATIONS FOR SUCH A 
MEETING ARE STILL NOTICEABLY ABSENT.  WE NOTE AS WELL 
THE PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT BASHAR HAS NOT LIVED UP TO 
EXPECTATIONS WITH HIS HANDLING OF THE LEBANON FILE, AND 
THAT VP KHADDAM IS STILL PERFORMING HIS TRADITIONAL ROLE 
AS ARBITER AMONG THE LEBANESE LEADERSHIP.  FINALLY, IT 
IS CLEAR THAT BASHAR CONTINUES TO BE EXCLUDED FROM PEACE 
PROCESS RELATED ACTIVITY, WHICH REMAINS AN ASAD-SHARA 
AFFAIR. 
 
5. (C) OTHER RESISTANCE MAY COME FROM BA\'TH PARTY 
STALWARTS GENERALLY UNHAPPY WITH SIGNS OF CHANGE IN 
SYRIA AND ASAD\'S DECISION TO PURSUE PEACE.  A MEMBER OF 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY POLITBURO CLAIMED THAT IN A RECENT 
MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE FRONT, WHICH HE 
ATTENDED, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE BA\'TH PARTY 
REGIONAL COMMAND DR. SULAYMAN QADDAH MADE OPENLY 
CRITICAL REMARKS ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS AND EVEN SPOKE 
RHETORICALLY ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.  WHILE 
THIS FORMER MP AGREED THAT THIS SENTIMENT WOULD NEVER 
STAND IN THE WAY OF ASAD\'S DESIRE TO CONCLUDE A PEACE 
WITH ISRAEL, HE SAID SUCH COMMENTS REFLECTED A CERTAIN 
ELEMENT OF \"OLD THINK\" THAT WAS RELUCTANT TO EMBRACE 
FORWARD MOVEMENT, EVEN WITH BASHAR. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT.  IF THE MEI INTERVIEW COMES OFF, IT WILL 
MARK BASHAR\'S MEDIA INTRODUCTION TO THE WEST, A 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN ITSELF SINCE FEW OFFICIAL 
SYRIANS ARE ALLOWED SUCH ENTREE.  WHILE IT MAY SIGNAL 
THE BEGINNING OF A SARG-ORCHESTRATED EFFORT TO \"SELL\" 
BASHAR TO THE WEST, AND THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR, 
IT IS LIKELY TO BE A HIGHLY STRUCTURED AND CONTROLLED 
EFFORT.  SOME OBSERVERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT IF THE U.S. 
GIVES BASHAR (AND A NEW MINORITY ALAWI REGIME) ITS 
BLESSING, \"ASAD WILL SIGN WITH ISRAEL TOMORROW.\"  WHILE 
THIS LINKAGE IS TOO BOLD, WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE 
HOW IMPORTANT OUR POSTURE TOWARDS BASHAR IS LIKELY TO 
BE, IN INCREASING MEASURE, IN THE MONTHS TO COME. 
 
7. (C) THUS FAR, THE BASHAR CAMPAIGN DOES NOT INCLUDE 
ACTUAL CONTACT WITH AMERICAN OFFICIALS; THERE HAS BEEN 
NO RESPONSE TO REQUESTS BY THE AMBASSADOR AND A NUMBER 
OF CODELS FOR MEETINGS.  OUR WESTERN DIPLOMATIC 
COLLEAGUES HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE, PRESUMABLY 
BECAUSE ASAD DOES NOT WANT POSSIBLY LESS-THAN-EFFUSIVE 
ASSESSMENTS TO REACH WORLD CAPITALS.  FOR NOW, 
THEREFORE, THE ANSWER TO PROBES ABOUT OUR VIEW IS 
SIMPLE: 
 
--THE USG HAS HAD NO CONTACT WITH BASHAR AL-ASAD. 
 
--DECISIONS ON LEADERSHIP IN SYRIA ARE FOR SYRIANS TO 
MAKE, NOT AMERICANS.

1. (C) SYRIAN RADIO AND TELEVISION AT 1800 BROADCAST THE 
OFFICIAL SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT TO PARLIAMENT 
THAT PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD HAD DIED.  THE SPEAKER OF 
THE PARLIAMENT ABD AL-QADIR QADDURA ANNOUNCED A FEW 
MINUTES LATER THAT A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE HAD 
BEEN FORMED TO DISCUSS AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 AN AMENDMENT WAS PASSED 
UNAMIMOUSLY WHICH AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO SAY THAT A 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE A SYRIAN ARAB OF AT LEAST 
34 YEARS OF AGE, BUT DID NOT NEED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE 
BA\'TH PARTY.  PREVIOUSLY THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRED THE 
PRESIDENT TO BE A SYRIAN ARAB MUSLIM AT LEAST FORTY 
YEARS OF AGE AND, IF NOT RECEIVING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY 
IN A NATIONAL REFERENDUM, BE SELECTED BY THE BA\'TH PARTY 
FOR FORMAL NOMINATION TO THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL. 
 
2. (C) IT WAS THEN ANNOUNCED THAT THE PARLIAMENT WOULD 
RECESS UNTIL JUNE 25.  THE AMENDMENT IS CLEARLY INTENDED 
DRAFTED TO ALLOW PRESIDENT ASAD\'S SON BASHAR TO BE 
NOMINATED AS PRESIDENT, BUT HIS NAME HAS NOT BEEN 
MENTIONED IN ANY OFFICIAL CONTEXT.  THE CONSTITUTION 
STATES THAT IN CASE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S \"DISABLEMENT\" THE 
VICE PRESIDENT--IN THIS CASE VP MUHAMMAD KHADDAM--WOULD 
BECOME ACTING PRESIDENT AND THAT IN CASE OF THE 
PRESIDENT\'S DEATH, A REFERENDUM MUST BE HELD WITHIN 90 
DAYS TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN 
NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCMENT THAT VP KHADDAM HAS ASSUMED THE 
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.  THE ARAB SATELLITE STATION AL- 
JAZIRA IS REPORTING THAT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT 
DEFENSE MINISTER MUSTAFA TALAS WILL ASSUME CHARGE 
TEMPORARILY, BUT WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION OF THAT REPORT. 
 
3.(C) THE AMBASSADOR CONTACTED DEFENSE MINISTER MUSTAFA 
TALAS AT APPROXIMATELY 1745 (BEFORE THE OFFICIAL 
ANNOUNCEMNT), WHO CONFIRMED ASAD\'S DEATH AND ASSURED THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT WHILE THE SARG WAS \"TAKING APPROPRIATE 
MEASURES,\" EVERYTHING WAS CALM.  AT 1945, STREETS HAVE 
BEEN CLOSED AROUND THE CHANCERY AND CROWDS ARE AMASSING 
AROUND THE PRESIDENT\'S HOME, WHICH IS LOCATED 
APPROXIMATELY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE CHANCERY.  WE HAVE NO 
SIGN OF ANY CROWDS MOVING TOWARDS OR AGAINST THE 
CHANCERY.  CROWDS ARE SHOUTING CHANTS PRAISING THE 
PRESIDENT AND IN SUPPORT OF BASHAR.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B)

1. (U) SYRIAN TELEVISION REPORTED THE AFTERNOON OF 6/11 
THAT VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM HAD SIGNED DECREE NUMBERS 9 
AND 10, PROMOTING COLONEL BASHAR AL-ASAD TO THE RANK OF 
GENERAL AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. 
 
2. (C) THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECT OF THIS IS THAT BASHAR 
HAS NOW OFFICIALLY ASSUMED ONE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S \"THREE 
HATS,\" I.E. HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, HEAD OF THE PARTY, 
AND HEAD OF STATE.  BASHAR IS EXPECTED TO BECOME HEAD OF 
THE BA\'TH PARTY AT THE PARTY CONGRESS, STILL EXPECTED TO 
TAKE PLACE JUNE 17-22, AND HEAD OF STATE AFTER A PUBLIC 
REFERENDUM WHICH COULD BE HELD AS EARLY AS JUNE 25. 
 
3. (C) THIS DEVELOPMENT ALSO POINTS MORE CLEARLY TO HOW 
WE BELIEVE THE DECISION-MAKING GROUP IS HANDLING THE 
ISSUE OF \"WHO\'S IN CHARGE.\"  NO INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN 
APPOINTED ACTING PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS 
STICKING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE 
AND THUS KHADDAM, AS FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNING DECREES.  HOWEVER, WE NOTE THAT 
KHADDAM IS NOT BEING REFERRED TO AS ACTING PRESIDENT, 
NOR HAS HE MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS LIKELY DELIBERATE.  THE DECISION- 
MAKING GROUP AT THIS POINT IS LIKELY COMPRISED OF 
BASHAR, \'ASIF SHAWQAT, FM SHARA, DEFMIN TALAS, AND 
PERHAPS OTHERS.  KHADDAM IS APPARENTLY COOPERATING AS 
TITULAR SIGNER OF DECREES UNTIL BASHAR CAN TAKE OVER 
OFFICIALLY.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  IN THE PAST THREE DAYS, AS MANY SYRIANS 
SAT NUMBLY ABSORBING THE NEWS THAT THEIR PRESIDENT, 
LEADER, AND FATHER FIGURE OF THREE DECADES HAD DIED, SON 
BASHAR AL-ASAD HAS QUIETLY AND SO FAR EFFECTIVELY 
ASSUMED CHARGE; HE AWAITS ONLY OFFICIAL PARTY AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL BLESSING.  WE BELIEVE THIS WILL COME 
QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DISRUPTION.  THE PARTY CONGRESS THAT 
WILL PROMOTE BASHAR TO PARTY HEAD WILL BEGIN JUNE 17, 
ALTHOUGH NOT WITH UNANIMOUS ENTHUSIASM.  IN A CAREFULLY 
CHOREOGRAPHED FUNERAL DISPLAY, SENIOR SYRIAN OFFICIALS, 
WITH DEFMIN MUSTAFA TALAS IN THE LEAD, LENT THEIR FULL 
SUPPORT AT OFFICIAL CEREMONIES JUNE 13 IN DAMASCUS.  THE 
ERA OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD, WHO, ON JUNE 10, DIED EXACTLY 33 
YEARS LATER TO THE DAY THAT ISRAEL FIRST REOCCUPIED THE 
GOLAN, IS OVER..  END SUMMARY. 
 
SYRIANS GATHER IN SHOCK--AND SORROW 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  MINISTER OF HEALTH DR. MUHAMMAD AL-SHATTI, 
ESCORT TO THE U.S. DELEGATION, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
THE NATION WAS STILL \"IN A STATE OF SHOCK.\"  BEFORE 6 
A.M. THE MORNING OF ASAD\'S FUNERAL JUNE 13, SYRIANS FROM 
ALL CORNERS HAD BEGUN TO GATHER IN THE CENTRAL AREA 
WHERE HIS CASKET WOULD BE CARRIED IN WALKING PROCESSION. 
WHILE REPUBLICAN GUARD AND POLICE SECURITY WAS THICK 
ALONG THE FUNERAL ROUTE AND THE AIRPORT ROAD, THE MANY 
THOUSANDS OF EMOTIONAL MOURNERS MADE THEIR MARCH AND 
DEPARTED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR 
CONTACTS HAVE FOR DECADES FELT NO PROBLEM EXPRESSING 
THEIR FRUSTRATION, RESENTMENT, OR OPPOSITION TO THIS 
REGIME DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF 
ASAD\'S PASSING IS STILL BEING ABSORBED, AND FOR SOME, 
THE FEELING OF LOSS IS STRONG.  THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT IS 
HEIGHTENED BY UNCERTAINTY AND APPREHENSION ABOUT THE 
FUTURE. 
 
AT THE PALACE: BASHAR IN CHARGE 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) NEWLY-MINTED GENERAL BASHAR AL-ASAD ACTED NOT 
ONLY AS A BEREAVED SON, BUT ALSO AS THE LEADER OF SYRIA 
AND THE PARAMOUNT HOST TO A STREAM OF FOREIGN 
DIGNITARIES ARRIVING TO PAY THEIR CONDOLENCES AND 
RESPECTS TO HIS FATHER THE MORNING OF JUNE 13.  THE 
MASSIVE, GLASS-WALLED PALACE THAT SITS ON THE HILLS 
OVERLOOKING DAMASCUS WAS FILLED WITH A RESPECTFUL BUZZ 
AS LARGE DELEGATIONS WERE LED, IN EFFICIENT PROCESSION, 
TO STAND BEFORE ASAD\'S CASKET.  DELEGATES THEN PROCEEDED 
TO BRIEF MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER FAROUK AL-SHARA, 
AND THEN GREETED COMMANDER IN CHIEF BASHAR AL-ASAD, WHO 
STOOD ALONE (NOTABLY WITHOUT HIS BROTHERS OR UNCLES) IN 
A LARGE RECEIVING ROOM TO THE SIDE.  THE MESSAGE WAS 
CLEAR THAT THIS WAS NOT A FAMILY GATHERING; GENERAL 
BASHAR WAS THERE AS CHIEF OF STATE.  HE APPEARED CALM, 
POISED, AND AUTHORITATIVE. 
 
4. (C) PROMINENT AMONG SENIOR SYRIANS WHO LINED THE 
FORMAL RECEIVING ROOM WAS DEFMIN TALAS, LENDING SUPPORT 
TO SEVERAL REPORTS THAT SINCE ASAD\'S DEATH TALAS HAD 
ASSUMED THE ROLE AS NUMBER ONE ADVISER TO BASHAR.  FM 
SHARA ACTED AS CO-HOST, SHUTTLING BETWEEN HIS DUTIES ON 
THE SYRIAN DELEGATION AND RECEIVING AND BIDDING GOODBYE 
TO VISITING DIGNITARIES.  THE LEBANESE LEADERSHIP AND 
OTHER LEBANESE WERE IN STRONG EVIDENCE AND SAT OPPOSITE 
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE RECEIVING HALL. 
 
NO ONE OPPOSING, BUT NOT EVERYONE 
HASTENING TOWARD THE FUTURE 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES WENT SMOOTHLY, INDICATING 
THAT THE SYRIA\'S CURRENT LEADERSHIP AND BA\'TH PARTY 
MACHINERY WAS ABLE TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY IN A CRISIS 
SITUATION.  THE BA\'TH PARTY CONGRESS WILL BEGIN AS 
PLANNED JUNE 17, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL PARTY MEMBERS ARE 
RUSHING TO EMBRACE THE NEW ERA.  MINISTER OF HEALTH AL- 
SHATTI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT IT WAS BASHAR WHO HAD 
INSISTED THAT THE BA\'TH PARTY CONGRESS GO AHEAD AS 
PLANNED, AN IMPORTANT STEP ON MOVING THE COUNTRY FROM 
MOURNING THE PAST TO BUILDING THE FUTURE.  HE REMARKED 
THAT, LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES, THE OSSIFIED PARTY 
LEADERSHIP PROBABLY WOULD WAIT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS, AND 
SAID THAT WHILE \"NO ONE WAS OPPOSED, NOT EVERYONE WAS 
HASTENING TOWARDS IT.\"   ON THE MUCH-DISCUSSED ISSUE OF 
ASAD\'S RIVAL AND BROTHER RIF\'AT, BOTH THE RUSSIAN AND 
EGYPTIAN AMBASSADORS DISCOUNTED THIS THREAT DESPITE THE 
RIF\'AT STATEMENT IN SPAIN CHALLENGING HIS NEPHEW. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT.  THE SYRIAN SUCCESSION IS PROCEEDING AS 
SMOOTHLY AND CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.  BASHAR PRESIDED AS 
LEADER OF SYRIA DURING THE FUNERAL PROCEEDINGS; SENIOR 
SYRIANS WERE THERE TO LEND HIM SUPPORT.  DESPITE THE 
PROMINENT PRESS PLAY, FEW OF OUR CONTACTS TAKE THE 
RIF\'AT CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY.  THE ERA OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD 
HAS OFFICIALLY PASSED AND THE BASHAR ERA HAS BEGUN.  THE 
SON APPEARS WELL ON HIS WAY TO GAINING POWER IN AN 
ORDERLY FASHION.  THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER HE CAN 
KEEP IT. UNLIKE JORDANIAN KING ABDULLAH, WHO ASSUMED THE 
THRONE BOLSTERED BY INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND 
LEGITIMACY, BASHAR\'S QUEST FOR LEGITIMACY WILL HINGE 
MORE ON SYRIA\'S COMPLEX INTERNAL SITUATION.

\"LEAD US, O BASHAR, WE ARE ALL BEHIND YOU\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) SYRIAN PRESS ON JUNE 14-15 WAS UNITED IN ITS 
SUPPORT FOR BASHAR.  AN EDITORIAL IN THE GOVERNMENT- 
CONTROLLED DAILY TISHRIN JUNE 14 EMPHASIZED THAT A \"BIG 
TRUST\" WAS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF BASHAR, TO WHOM \"WE 
PLEDGED OUR ALLEGIANCE A LONG TIME AGO\".  THE EDITORIAL 
EMPASIZED BASHAR\'S DESIRE TO BOTH BUILD A MODERN SYRIA 
CAPABLE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE \"SCIENTIFIC AND 
INFORMATION RENAISSANCE\" AND TO CONTINUE THE \"UNIQUE 
STRUGGLE MARCH\" FOR ARAB RIGHTS BEGUN BY HIS FATHER.  THE 
PIECE CONCLUDED BY URGING THE HEIR APPARENT TO \"LEAD US, O 
BASHAR, WE ARE ALL BEHIND YOU\".  A JUNE 15 EDITORIAL IN 
THE SAME PUBLICATION SIMILARLY STRESSED THAT \"THE 
CONSENSUS OF THE SYRIANS ON THEIR PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO 
GENERAL DR. BASHAR AL-ASAD AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY . 
IS A CLEAR INDICATION OF THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE 
CORRECTIONIST COURSE, THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION, 
LIBERATION, STEADFASTNESS AND JOINT ARAB ACTION\". 
 
THE LION AND THE CUB:  BASHAR AND HIS FATHER\'S LEGACY 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY AL-BA\'TH REPORTED 
ON JUNE 14 THAT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WERE LOYAL ONLY TO THE 
LATE, GREAT FIGHTER WHO \"ACHIEVED MIRACLES IN A RECORD 
RACE WITH TIME\" (LATE PRESIDENT ASAD) AND TO THE \"LION CUB 
(BASHAR)\" REARED UNDER HIS FATHER\'S TUTELAGE, WHO WILL 
CARRY ON HIS LEGACY.  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SYRIA TIMES 
ECHOED THE THEME OF CONTINUITY IN AN EDITORIAL THAT 
PROCLAIMED THAT BASHAR AL-ASAD WILL \"SUSTAIN HIS FATHER\'S 
RICH LEGACY AND CONTINUE ENHANCING THE COUNTRY\'S MARCH OF 
STEADFASTNESS AND ALL-OUT DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE NATION\'S 
RIGHTS AND LANDS ARE TOTALLY RETURNED, ITS DIGNITY AND 
PRIDE ARE FULLY SAFEGUARDED AND A DECENT PLACE UNDER THE 
SUN IS PRESERVED\". 
 
4.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY AL-BA\'TH REPORTED 
THAT MEMBERS OF THE SYRIAN AL-MUSAWIYAH (JEWISH) COMMUNITY 
HELD A SPECIAL SERVICE TO HONOR THE LATE PRESIDENT ASAD. 
KHADR AL-KABARITI, WHO LED THE SERVICE, PRAISED THE LATE 
PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO GRANT MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY EQUAL RIGHTS.  HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THE NOMINATION OF BASHAR TO THE SYRIAN 
PRESIDENCY AND EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD \"BE A 
GREAT LEADER, LIKE HIS FATHER, AND BE THE BEST SUCCESSOR 
TO A GREAT LEADER\". 
 
GRIEF AND OPTIMISM AMONG ARAB LEADERS 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY TISHRIN STATED ON JUNE 
14 THAT MILLIONS OF SYRIAN CITIZENS AND A VERY LARGE 
NUMBER OF WORLD DELEGATIONS MOURNED THE LATE PRESIDENT, 
AND THAT PEOPLE FROM ALL ARAB COUNTRIES TOOK PART IN THE 
FUNERAL PROCESSION.  SIGNIFICANT COVERAGE WAS DEDICATED TO 
THE STATEMENTS OF CONDOLENCE MADE BY VARIOUS FOREIGN 
DELEGATIONS.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE 
STATEMENT CABLED BY SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH BIN ABD 
AL-AZIZ TO BASHAR.  THE CABLE FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN 
LOCAL ARABIC-LANGUAGE PRESS AND IN THE GOVERNMENT- 
CONTROLLED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY SYRIA TIMES.  ABDALLAH 
EXPRESSED HIS DEEP REGRET OVER THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LATE 
PRESIDENT ASAD, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT HIS DELEGATION LEFT 
SYRIA WITH \"COMPLETE OPTIMISM AND CONFIDENCE THAT SYRIA 
WILL BY THE WILL OF GOD BE IN SAFE AND SKILLFUL HANDS OF 
ONE WHO HAS GROWN UP WITH FAITH IN GOD, PRIDE IN THE 
NATION\'S HERITAGE, VALUES, SOLIDARITY IN RIGHT, DEPTH IN 
THINKING, AND FAR-SIGHTEDNESS\".  THE CROWN PRINCE FURTHER 
STRESSED SAUDI ARABIA\'S FULL SUPPORT FOR SYRIA IN ALL 
CIRCUMSTANCES AS AN ISLAMIC AND MORAL DUTY.  HE CONCLUDED 
BY EXTENDING BEST WISHES TO BASHAR IN LEADING THE COUNTRY. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SYRIAN PRESS HAS 
COME DOWN SQUARELY BEHIND BASHAR, STRESSING THE THEME OF 
CONTINUITY AND PERPETUATION OF HIS FATHER\'S LEGACY.  WHILE 
SYRIAN MEDIA HAS ACCORDED FULL ATTENTION TO PRESIDENT 
ASAD\'S PASSING, IT HAS BEEN CAREFUL TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE 
COUNTRY NOW STANDS UNITED BEHIND THE HEIR APPARENT.  THE 
PROMINENT COVERAGE OF THE COMMENTS OF FOREIGN DELEGATES, 
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, SUGGEST 
THE IMPORTANCE THE NEW REGIME ACCORDS TO AN EARLY ARAB 
STAMP OF APPROVAL FOR BASHAR.

INTO CONFLICT.\" 
 
-- HIZBALLAH:  \"POLITICALLY AND MORALLY, WE TOTALLY SUPPORT 
HIZBALLAH AND ITS JUST CAUSE OF REGAINING THOSE TERRITORIES 
IN LEBANON WHICH ARE STILL UNDER OCCUPATION...SYRIA DOES 
NOT CONTROL THE ACTIONS OF HIZBALLAH\" 
 
-- CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL:  \"SO LONG AS WE REMAIN COMMITTED 
TO THE PEACE STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT LET OURSELVES BE DRAWN 
INTO WAR.  BUT NEITHER WILL WE SHY AWAY FROM IT, SHOULD WAR 
BE FORCED UPON US.  MOREOVER, THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF 
THINGS THAT WILL HIT ISRAEL HARDER THAN WAR.  WE HAVE ONE 
OR TWO IN OUR LOCKER.\" 
 
-- INTIFADA:  \"ARAFAT HAS NEVER BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
INTIFADA....THE INTIFADA IS NOT THE WORK OF ONE MAN, ONE 
STATE, OR ONE PARTY, IT IS THE REVOLT OF THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE.\" 
 
-- PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WITH ISRAEL: ASAD DENIED THAT SYRIA 
SUPPORTED A NEW \"CALL TO DRIVE THE ISRAELIS INTO THE SEA.\" 
\"THIS IS NOT OUR REASONING...WE ACCEPT THE REASONING OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND SAY, AS YOU DO IN GERMANY [AND] 
IN THE U.S. THAT ISRAEL MUST HAND BACK THE TERRITORIES IT 
OCCUPIED IN 1967.  THE [HARSHER] TONE WE\'RE ADOPTING IS IN 
LINE WITH THE CHANGING CONDITIONS [I.E., CURRENT TENSION IN 
THE REGION].  IN TERMS OF POLICY, WE STICK BY OUR 
PRINCIPLES [I.E., NEGOTIATIONS BASED ON MADRID TERMS OF 
REFERENCE]. 
 
-- ANTISEMITIC REMARKS:  \"WE SYRIANS OPPOSE THE TERM ANTI- 
SEMITISM...SEMITES ARE A RACE...WE ARE AT ITS CORE...I 
MERELY COMPARED CHRIST\'S AGONIES WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF THE 
PALESTINIANS.\"  ASKED IF HE HAD MEANT THAT JEWS WERE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR CHRIST\'S AGONIES, ASAD REPLIED THAT \"THESE 
ARE HISTORICAL FACTS WHICH WE CANNOT DENY.  BUT HOW CAN 
ANYONE ATTRIBUTE AN ANTI-JEWISH ATTITUDE TO ME, WHEN WE 
ALSO HAVE JEWISH CITIZENS HERE IN SYRIA, AND WE AS MUSLIMS 
RECOGNIZE THE JEWISH RELIGION?\" 
 
-- THE ECONOMY:  \"SYRIA IS STILL A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, BUT 
WE DO OF COURSE HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE...WE ARE 
BUILDING DEVELOPMENT POLICY ON TWO PILLARS: CREATING MORE 
JOBS, AND RAISING STANDARDS OF LIVING.  WE WILL CONSIDER 
ANYTHING THAT HELPS TO ACHIEVE THIS.  BUT WE WILL NOT SELL 
THE STATE SECTOR.\" 
 
3. (U) COMMENT:  ASAD\'S PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST SHARON AND 
HIS THREATS TO RESPOND TO FURTHER ISRAELI STRIKES ARE 
HARSHER AND MORE EXPLICIT THAN HIS RECENT PUBLIC REMARKS ON 
THESE ISSUES.  THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE INCREASING 
PRESSURE HE FEELS, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES AND 
OTHER ARAB LEADERS, TO RESPOND MORE DIRECTLY IF ATTACKED 
AGAIN.  HE IS LIKELY FRUSTRATED THAT THE ANTI-SEMITISM 
ISSUE HASN\'T GONE AWAY AND CONCERNED THAT PROTESTS COULD 
MAR WHAT HE HOPES WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO BERLIN THIS 
WEEK.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY CDA PHILO L. DIBBLE, REASONS 1.5 B/D. 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY. IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW WITH 
ITALIAN DAILY CORRIERE DELLA SERA, BASHAR AL-ASAD 
WARNED THAT A STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ WOULD DESTABILIZE 
THE REGION.  HE ALSO DENIED THAT SYRIAN OIL IMPORTS OF 
IRAQI OIL VIOLATED UNSCRS; REPEATED SYRIA\'S COMMITMENT 
TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE; SAID THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION 
LACKS A CLEAR VISION REGARDING THE MEPN AND SPEAKS 
WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES; CLAIMED A \"FREE PRESS\" 
AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AMONG THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY; SAID INDIVIDUAL HUMAN RIGHTS MUST NOT 
CONFLICT WITH THE RIGHTS OF SOCIETY; SAID HIS PERSONAL 
INTERESTS INCLUDE EXERCISING, READING ABOUT HISTORY, 
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND \"ANYTHING DIGITAL;\" AND CALLED 
FOR INCREASED DIRECT CONTACTS BETWEEN THE WEST AND 
MUSLIM COUNTRIES TO OVERCOME GLOBAL MISUNDERSTANDING. 
ASAD\'S INTERVIEW WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF 
SUBJECTS DISCUSSED, HIS EVIDENT SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND 
THE EVOLUTION OF A PROFESSORIAL STYLE THAT RESULTS IN 
LENGTHY (AND SOMETIMES UNWISE) EXPLANATIONS OF SYRIAN 
POSITIONS.  HE REMAINS, IN OUR VIEW, VERY MUCH A WORK 
IN PROGRESS, BUT ONE WHOSE PROFESSED INTEREST IN 
ENGAGING THE WEST IS WORTH TESTING.   END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C) IN AN INTERVIEW  PUBLISHED IN THE ITALIAN 
DAILY \"CORRIERE DELLA SERA,\" IN ADVANCE OF HIS 19 
FEBRUARY VISIT TO ITALY, SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL- 
ASAD COVERED TOPICS RANGING FROM IRAQ AND THE MEPN TO 
HIS HOBBIES.  THREE VERSIONS OF THE INTERVIEW 
APPEARED:  THE CORRIERE DELLA SERA PUBLISHED EXCERPTS 
OF THE INTERVIEW IN ITALIAN (TRANSLATED BY FBIS IN 
REFTEL), WHILE SYRIAN AND REGIONAL ARABIC MEDIA 
PUBLISHED A LONGER \"FULL TEXT\" IN ARABIC, AND THE 
SYRIA TIMES PUBLISHED A \"FULL TEXT\" IN ENGLISH THAT 
INCLUDED ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS THAT WERE NOT IN THE 
ITALIAN OR ARABIC VERSIONS.   HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SYRIA 
TIMES VERSION OF THE INTERVIEW FOLLOW. 
 
--------------- 
WARNING ON IRAQ 
--------------- 
 
3.  (U) \"WHAT I ASK MYSELF IS THIS:   IS THERE ANY 
JUSTIFICATION FOR AN ATTACK ON IRAQ?   DOES AN ATTACK 
BY ANY CHANCE FORM PART OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST 
TERRORISM?   IN ATTACKING IRAQ DOES ONE DEFEND JUSTICE 
AND DEMOCRACY, OR DOES ONE FUEL PRECISELY INJUSTICE 
AND THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS?   I BELIEVE THAT AN 
ATTACK WOULD BE AGAINST JUSTICE AND AGAINST HUMAN 
RIGHTS.   ALL THE ARAB AND MUSLIM COUNTRIES, WITHOUT 
EXCEPTION, ARE OPPOSED TO IT.  AND ALL THE EUROPEAN 
ENVOYS WITH WHOM I HAVE MET, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, HAVE 
EXPRESSED THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY.\" 
 
4.  (U) \"AN ATTACK ON IRAQ WOULD BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS. 
THE PEOPLE\'S WRATH WOULD BECOME FAR MORE DANGEROUS 
THAN POLITICAL REACTIONS.   I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 
UNITED STATES NEEDS TO ATTRACT ANY FURTHER HATRED.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
SYRIA/IRAQ PIPELINE NOT A VIOLATION? 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) FROM ARABIC VERSION:  \"CONCERNING THE OIL, WE 
ANNOUNCED OUR OPINION VERY CLEARLY FROM THE BEGINNING. 
WE SAID THAT THERE WAS OLD OIL PIPELINE BETWEEN US AND 
IRAQ THAT WE TESTED LAST YEAR.  WHEN WE SAY WE ARE 
TESTING, WE ARE DEFINITELY TESTING IT WITH OIL AND NOT 
WITH WATER OR AIR.  AND CERTAINLY THE DIRECTION IS 
FROM IRAQ TO SYRIA BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OIL TO SEND TO 
IRAQ.  AND I HAVE SAID THIS TO AMERICAN OFFICIALS. 
BUT THIS IS A VERY OLD PIPELINE THAT HAS BEEN THERE 
SINCE THE FIFTIES, AND WHEN WE HAD OUR POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES WITH IRAQ, THIS PIPELINE WAS NOT USED. 
ITS OPERATION IS DIFFICULT, WHICH PROMPTED US TO 
ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NEW PIPELINE 
WITH MUCH BIGGER CAPACITY.  AND WE WERE DISCUSSING 
THIS PIPELINE WITH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND WITH 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  AND WE SAID THAT WITH THIS NEW 
PIPELINE OR IN ANY OIL TRANSACTIONS WITH IRAQ, WE WILL 
ABIDE BY UN RESOLUTIONS.\" 
 
6.  (U) THE SYRIA TIMES VERSION ADDS:  \"AND WE SAID 
THAT WITH THIS NEW PIPELINE WITH IRAQ, WE ARE GOING TO 
BE COMMITTED TO UN RESOLUTIONS AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO 
SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR A MEETING THAT THE UN SHOULD 
CONVENE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT THE END OF LAST SUMMER, 
AND THEN THIS MEETING WAS POSTPONED.  AND THEREFORE, 
WE ARE NOT VIOLATING ANY U.N. RESOLUTIONS.\" 
 
----------------------- 
NO CONDITIONS FOR PEACE 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (U) \"SYRIA HAS NEVER SET ANY CONDITIONS, AND WE 
ALWAYS SAY THAT SYRIA DOES NOT HAVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
AT ALL.  WHEN SYRIA SPEAKS ABOUT THE BASES FOR PEACE 
IT REFERS TO THE NECESSITY OF IMPLEMENTING SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND MADRID\'S TERMS OF REFERENCE. 
THESE TERMS OF REFERENCE WERE NOT INVENTED BY SYRIA, 
RATHER THEY WERE AMERICAN IDEAS AND THEY BECAME 
INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTIONS ONCE THEY WERE APPROVED BY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. ... HENCE, OUR CONDITIONS 
ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND 
THEY STIPULATE THE FULL RETURN OF SYRIAN RIGHTS.\" 
 
--------------------- 
AMERICA HAS NO VISION 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (U) \"UNTIL NOW THE ROLE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO 
EUROPE BY THE UNITED STATES IS TO MARKET AMERICAN 
IDEAS, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN ALLOWED TO PLAY A ROLE OF 
ITS OWN MAKING.  BUT EVEN THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION 
DOESN\'T HAVE A CLEAR VISION OF HOW TO CONDUCT THIS 
PEACE PROCESS. ...I CAN\'T SEE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
ARE PREPARED FOR THIS ROLE UNLESS EUROPE WANTS TO PLAY 
THIS ROLE IN AN INDEPENDENT FASHION.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
AND SPEAKS WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) \"I THINK THAT IF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION 
IS ABLE TO FORMULATE A SINGLE OPINION, THEN THEY COULD 
PROBABLY HAVE COOPERATION WITH EUROPE.  BUT YOU NEED 
FIRST TO HAVE A SINGLE OPINION.  THIS IS WHAT I SAID 
TO WILLIAM BURNS, THE U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
STATE, WHEN HE VISITED ME IN DAMASCUS TWO MONTHS AGO. 
I SAID TO HIM: YOU ARE A GROUP OF ADMINISTRATIONS, NOT 
JUST ONE ADMINISTRATION.  EACH ONE OF YOUR 
ADMINISTRATIONS HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
LEBANON: OUR PRESENCE IS TEMPORARY 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) \"WE DON\'T BUILD OUR RELATIONS WITH LEBANON ON 
THE BASIS OF THE MILITARY PRESENCE. ...THE PRESENCE IS 
A TEMPORARY ONE.  I THINK THE ACTUAL ACT OF 
REDEPLOYMENT IS SUBJECT TO A MILITARY FACTOR AND THE 
CONDITIONS THAT INFLUENCE THIS, PARTICULARLY THE SOUTH 
OF LEBANON AND THE ISRAELI SITUATION.\" 
 
11.  (U) [ASKED ABOUT SYRIAN RELATIONS WITH ELIE 
HOBEIKA]  \"IN FACT, THE ONE WHO SUPERVISED AND 
INITIATED THE KILLINGS IS SHARON PERSONALLY.\" (ASAD 
DID NOT MENTION HOBEIKA.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM 
----------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U) [REGARDING SUICIDE BOMBERS] \"I CAN BRIEFLY 
SAY THAT THE FRAME OF MIND THAT PUSHES PEOPLE TO DIE 
IS THE RESULT OF THE ACCUMULATION OF HUGE FRUSTRATION 
AND OPPRESSION THAT IS PRACTICED AGAINST THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  WHETHER THE WEST AGREES OR 
DIFFERS WITH THEM, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF ISRAELI 
TERRORISM AGAINST THEM.  WESTERN OFFICIALS WASTE THEIR 
TIME IN CONDEMNING THESE PEOPLE.  WHY DON\'T THEY GET 
REALISTIC AND GO BACK TO THE ROOT CAUSES?  THESE 
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF THEY DON\'T GO DIE IN ISRAEL, 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE KILLED IN THEIR OWN HOUSES, 
BECAUSE SHARON IS COMING TO THEM IN THEIR HOUSES. .WE 
THINK, REGARDLESS OF OUR OWN PERSONAL OPINIONS, THAT 
THE ONLY SOLUTION  IS TO ADDRESS THE REAL CAUSE OF 
THIS PROBLEM BY EXERTING PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO STOP 
KILLING THE PALESTINIANS.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
SYRIAN UN REP COMMENTS ON 9/11 
------------------------------ 
 
13.  (U) [NO APOLOGY, BUT A LENGTHY EXPLANATION ABOUT 
DIFFERING FRAMES OF REFERENCE; ESSENTIALLY, PEOPLE 
FEEL MOST STRONGLY WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THEM AND THE 
COMPARISON WAS BETWEEN 9/11 AND THE ACCUMULATION OF 
THE PAIN INFLICTED UPON PALESTINIANS AND ARABS BY 
ISRAEL SINCE 1948.] 
 
------------------ 
ISLAM AND THE WEST 
------------------ 
 
14.  (U) IS THERE A BOOK FOR WESTERN READERS THAT CAN 
EXPLAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND THE 
WESTERN WORLD?]  \"REGRETTABLY, MOST OF THE BOOKS 
AVAILABLE NOW ARE WRITTEN BY NON-MUSLIMS. WE ARE DOING 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN SYRIA, WE ARE TRYING TO CALL 
FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO CONDUCT WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS 
ABOUT ISLAM.  THIS IS WHAT WE DID WITH THE AMERICANS 
AND THE EUROPEANS; WE SHALL CONTINUE THESE DIALOGUES 
WITH DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ABOUT MEDIA, 
ACADEMIA, CULTURE, AND BUSINESS.  I ADVISE THAT DIRECT 
CONTACT, PERSONAL CONTACT BE ESTABLISHED.\" 
 
------------ 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
------------ 
 
15. (U) \"FIRST, WE SAY HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WE CAN\'T 
SEPARATE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF ONE PERSON AND THE RIGHT 
OF SOCIETY.  SECOND, WHEN WE SAY THE RIGHT OF ONE 
PERSON, IT MEANS HIS RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
IMPROVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT HE HAS 
NO RIGHT TO UNDERMINE THE INTEREST OF HIS COUNTRY.  I 
THINK THAT SOCIETIES HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS OF THESE 
RIGHTS ACCORDING TO THEIR CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL 
DEVELOPMENTS.  THEREFORE, THE POLITICAL PRISONERS YOU 
HAVE TALKED ABOUT WERE IMPRISONED BECAUSE THERE WERE 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE DIFFICULT AND THEY HARMED THE 
REAL INTEREST OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY.  THE LARGE NUMBER 
OF POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT WERE LET FREE WAS DURING 
THE TIME OF THE LATE PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD, BECAUSE 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS PRESIDENCY? 
------------------------------- 
 
16.  (U) \"WE HAVE ISSUED LAWS IN MANY DOMAINS.  WE 
STARTED LARGE SCALE TRAINING OF PEOPLE IN COOPERATION 
WITH THE EU IN DIFFERENT FIELDS.  WE STARTED A GREATER 
PARTICIPATION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE TO HELP IN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE DOING THEIR WORK.  WE 
ACTIVATED A REAL DIALOGUE AMONG THE SYRIAN PEOPLE 
ABOUT THE SYRIAN VISION OF THE FUTURE. ...WE PERMITTED 
PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN SYRIA AND WE ALLOWED FREE 
PRESS IN SYRIA!  A FEW WEEKS AGO WE STARTED 
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING STATIONS.\" 
 
------------------ 
PERSONAL QUESTIONS 
------------------ 
 
17.  (U) [ASKED WHETHER BEING A PRESIDENT WAS 
RESTRICTIVE, SINCE HE COULDN\'T GO TO THE CINEMA LIKE 
ORDINARY FOLKS.]  \"I DON\'T HAVE THE HOBBY OF GOING TO 
THE CINEMA, BUT I LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE A LOT.  AND I DO 
THAT, I MIX WITH PEOPLE JUST AS I USED TO DO BEFORE I 
BECAME A PRESIDENT, BUT LESS OFTEN BECAUSE I HAVE LESS 
TIME.\" [INTERVIEWER: AND WHAT IS YOUR HOBBY?] \"I 
EXERCISE A LOT AND I READ A LOT.\"  [ABOUT WHAT?] 
\"MOSTLY HISTORY.  AND I LOVE TO GET TO KNOW NEW 
INVENTIONS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE COMPUTER AND NEW 
TECHNOLOGY, EVERYTHING DIGITAL.\"  [ARE YOU FOND OF 
FOOTBALL CLUBS?]  \"NO.\" [NOT EVEN WHEN YOU WERE IN 
LONDON?]  \"NO.\" 
 
18.  (C) COMMENT:  NOW APPARENTLY A STANDARD PRACTICE 
IN ADVANCE OF VISITS ABROAD, ASAD\'S INTERVIEW WAS 
NOTEWORTHY FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS DISCUSSED, 
HIS EVIDENT SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND THE EVOLUTION OF A 
PROFESSORIAL STYLE THAT RESULTS IN LENGTHY (AND 
SOMETIMES UNWISE) EXPLANATIONS OF SYRIAN POSITIONS. 
HIS ACCOUNT OF WHY SYRIA\'S ILLICIT OIL IMPORTS FROM 
IRAQ ARE NOT VIOLATING UNSCRS IS UNINFORMED OR 
DISINGENUOUS.  HIS TALLYING OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, IF 
LESS OUT OF SYNC WITH REALITY THAN BA\'THI PROPAGANDA, 
STILL STRAINS THE CREDULITY OF OBJECTIVE OBSERVERS. 
WE WERE STRUCK BY HIS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PURELY 
PERSONAL TOPICS.  HIS PREFERENCES (A COMPLETE LACK OF 
INTEREST IN FOOTBALL; INTEREST IN EXERCISE AND A 
PASSION FOR TECHNOLOGY) SET HIM FAR APART FROM THE OLD 
GUARD OBSERVERS ON WHOM HE STILL DEPENDS.  HE REMAINS, 
IN OUR VIEW, VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS, BUT ONE 
WHOSE PROFESSED INTEREST IN ENGAGING THE WEST IS WORTH 
TESTING.  END COMMENT.

1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THEODORE H. KATTOUF, REASON 
1.5 B/D. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY: IN A TWO-HOUR DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESSMAN 
DAVID PRICE, PRESIDENT AL-ASAD SAID THE US ADMINISTRATION HAS 
NO CLEAR MIDDLE EAST VISION.  THE DISPARATE ADMINISTRATION 
VOICES HURT THE US REGIONALLY.  PROGRESS TOWARDS 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE REQUIRES A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT 
VISION, AND IMPARTIAL US MEDIATION.  ASAD COMPLAINED THAT 
THERE IS NO POLITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN SYRIA AND THE US, AND 
THAT THE RELATIONSHIP \'ONLY COMES THROUGH ISRAEL.\'  ANY 
SYRIAN EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR US POLICY COULD ONLY COME 
AFTER EXTENSIVE BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  THE PROPOSED 
QUARTET-INITIATED CONFERENCE COULD TURN INTO A POINTLESS 
PHOTO OP, SINCE THE PRINCIPLES FOR A NEGOTIATED PEACE WERE 
ALREADY ARTICULATED AND LAUNCHED AT MADRID.  US POLICY 
TOWARDS IRAQ HAS SERVED ONLY TO MAKE SADDAM STRONGER; THE US 
SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED WITH REGIONAL COUNTRIES BEFORE 
THREATENING UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION.  A FREED ARAFAT CAN 
STILL DO NOTHING, SINCE HE HAS NO RESOURCES AND THE INTIFADA 
IS THE DOMINANT REALITY.  THE JENIN AND NABLUS \'MASSACRES,\' 
WHICH \'KILLED OVER SIX HUNDRED PALESTINIANS,\' HAVE POSTPONED 
THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE.   ASAD SAID THAT \'NO ONE WANTS TO 
HEAR\' TALK OF PEACE, AND SYRIA WOULD WAIT UNTIL EMOTIONS 
COOLED BEFORE DECIDING WHAT TO DO.  HE CALLED FOR MORE VISITS 
BY CONGRESSMEN AND SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TO SYRIA, 
SO THEY COULD GET A CLEARER PICTURE OF REGIONAL REALITIES. 
WE TAKE ASAD AT HIS WORD THAT, GIVEN THE ENFLAMED PASSIONS 
AND DYNAMIC REGIONAL SITUATION, SYRIAN POLICY WILL MOVE 
TOWARD ITS TRADITIONAL DEFAULT OF \'WAITING.\'  END SUMMARY 
 
3. (C) ON MAY 4, CONGRESSMAN DAVID PRICE (D-NC) MET FOR TWO 
HOURS WITH SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASAD.  AMBASSADOR 
KATTOUF AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) WERE ALSO PRESENT, AS WAS 
WAYNE OWENS, PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION; FM SHARA AND INTERPRETER/ADVISOR 
DR. BUTHAYNA SHA\'BAN ATTENDED ON THE SYRIAN SIDE. 
 
4. (C) PRESIDENT AL-ASAD TOLD PRICE HE\'D MET A LOT OF HIS 
COLLEAGUES RECENTLY (PRICE WAS THE EIGHTH CODEL PRESIDENT 
BASHAR RECEIVED IN RECENT MONTHS), AND WAS HAPPY TO MEET HIM. 
 THE US ADMINISTRATION SEEMED NOT TO BE FULLY \'IN THE 
PICTURE.\' CONGRESSMAN PRICE\'S VISIT, LIKE THOSE OF HIS 
PREDECESSORS, COULD HELP CONVEY A CLEARER PICTURE OF REGIONAL 
REALITIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION. 
 
5. (C) CONGRESSMAN PRICE THANKED ASAD FOR SYRIA\'S EFFECTIVE 
COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION, AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS 
ENCOURAGED NOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS FULLY ENGAGED IN 
THE REGION.  ALTHOUGH THE RECENT VISIT OF SECRETARY POWELL 
DIDN\'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS, THE SYRIAN AND LEBANESE LEG OF THE 
TRIP WAS SUCCESSFUL, FOR WHICH HE ALSO THANKED ASAD. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
US: NO CLEAR VISION, NO REAL DIALOGUE WITH SYRIA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (C) ASAD SAID SYRIA AND OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE DONE ALL 
THEY COULD TO KEEP THE US FULLY ENGAGED.  THROUGH MEETINGS 
AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE, SYRIA HAS REPROACHED THE US FOR ITS 
REGIONAL ABSENCE AND ENCOURAGED IT TOWARDS GREATER 
ENGAGEMENT.  ONE OF THE CAUSES OF JENIN WAS THIS US ABSENCE. 
ADDITIONALLY, THE US HAS ALSO MADE MANY MISTAKES.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, PRESIDENT BUSH ERRED IN CALLING SHARON A \'MAN OF 
PEACE\' WHILE THE LATTER WAS KILLING PALESTINIANS.  SUCH 
STATEMENTS OBSTRUCT ANY POSITIVE US ROLE. 
 
7. (C) REPEATING EARLIER CRITICISM THAT THE US SPEAKS WITH A 
MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES, ASAD ASSERTED THAT \'THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS NO CLEAR VISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO.\'  ASAD 
ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THAT SYRIA DOESN\'T SEE US OFFICIALS 
UNLESS THERE IS AN \'ISRAELI PROBLEM,\' AND THAT CURRENTLY 
SYRIA HAS NO REAL DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.  \'I\'VE 
MET WITH SECRETARY POWELL TWICE, AND ONE OF THESE VISITS (THE 
MORE RECENT) WAS NOT EVEN PLANNED BEFOREHAND.\'  HE HAD ASKED 
THE SECRETARY HOW COULD ANYTHING BE DISCUSSED IN ONE HOUR, 
LET ALONE THE GOLAN AND THE MEPP, WHEN THEY\'D NOT MET IN 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS. 
 
--------------------------- 
SYRIAN STATEMENT OF SUPPORT 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (C) PRICE TOLD ASAD THAT IT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTIVE FOR HIM 
TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS HIS AND HIS COUNTRY\'S SUPPORT FOR AN 
ACTIVE US REGIONAL ROLE, OR TO DO SO PRIVATELY IF A PUBLIC 
EXPRESSION WERE NOT POSSIBLE.  ASAD SAID THAT WHATEVER STAND 
SYRIA TOOK WOULD BE A PUBLIC ONE.  IN ANY CASE, SYRIA 
SUPPORTED POLICIES, NOT OFFICIALS.  SYRIA WOULD SUPPORT AN 
APPROPRIATE US ROLE.  BUT SYRIA HAS ITS DIFFERENCES WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION, THE ISSUES ARE VERY COMPLEX, SYRIA WOULD NOT 
BE ABLE TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT PRESIDENT BUSH UNTIL AFTER 
EXTENDED BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  FOR THIS REASON, THE SYRIAN 
PRESIDENT STATED, HE HAD CALLED FOR A BROADER BILATERAL 
DIALOGUE WITH THE US. 
 
9. (C) PRICE ASKED ASAD FOR HIS REACTION TO THE SUMMER 
CONFERENCE PROPOSED BY THE QUARTET TO ADVANCE THE MEPP.  ASAD 
SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN BRIEFED, AND ASKED WHAT WOULD BE THE 
POINT OF THE CONFERENCE.  WHAT CAN THIS CONFERENCE ADD TO THE 
MADRID LAND FOR PEACE FRAMEWORK?  ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION, 
ASAD SAID THAT A CONFERENCE COULDN\'T ACHIEVE PEACE; ONLY 
NEGOTIATIONS COULD.  THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE CEREMONIAL. 
 
10. (C) AMBASSADOR KATTOUF SUGGESTED THE CONFERENCE COULD 
GIVE THE MEPP A NEW IMPETUS BY ALLOWING THE QUARTET, AND 
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES TO RECOMMIT THEMSELVES TO A NEGOTIATED 
SETTLEMENT BASED ON THE MADRID PRINCIPLES.  ASAD RESPONDED 
THAT IT COULD BECOME A MEDIA EVENT.  THE EU AND THE UN WANT 
TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE, AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE 
ALWAYS EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO DO LIKEWISE.  REGARDLESS OF 
A CONFERENCE, EVERYBODY WAS READY FOR PEACE.  BUT THE RECENT 
ISRAELI \'MASSACRES\' HAVE DELAYED THE PEACE PROCESS LONGER 
THAN MERELY THE TIME THAT SHARON REMAINED IN OFFICE.  ASAD 
SAID HE SAW NO BENEFIT IN THE CONFERENCE, BUT IT WAS UP TO 
THOSE PROPOSING IT TO STATE ITS PURPOSE. 
 
11. (C) PRICE AGREED THERE WAS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THE THREE 
PRIORITIES STATED BY SECRETARY POWELL, BUT IT WAS ALSO TRUE 
THAT THE MEPP WAS IN SHAMBLES.  THE HOPE WAS THAT THE CYCLE 
OF VIOLENCE COULD BE BROKEN.  PRICE ASKED ASAD HOW COULD WE 
GET A FRESH START?  WHAT WERE VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO THIS 
CONFERENCE?  WHAT ELSE SHOULD THE US DO BESIDES SEEKING TO 
CONTAIN THE VIOLENCE? 
 
12. (C) ANSWERING, ASAD SAID DURING THE PAST PERIOD THERE 
HAVE BEEN MANY FAILED INITIATIVES.  HE EXPECTED THESE 
FAILURES AND TOLD THE US SO (READ: TENET-MITCHELL).  WHY DOES 
THE US ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF \'LAUNCHING INITIATIVES?\'  IF 
THERE IS NO INITIAL CLARITY, THE CONCERNED PARTIES WILL \'WALK 
A DISTANCE AND THEN BE LOST AND AT JEOPARDY.\'  SWITCHING 
ANALOGIES, ASAD SAID THAT SOME MEDICINES ARE ONLY TEMPORARY 
AND DON\'T TREAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE.  WE MUST GO BACK TO 
THE \'RIGHT INITIATIVE\' - MADRID, WHICH WILL LEAD US TO PEACE. 
 
------------------------------------- 
FORGET NEW CONFERENCE; ENFORCE MADRID 
------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) ASAD SAID THAT THE STARTING POINT FOR THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTING PM SHARON WHILE HE 
KILLS PALESTINIANS.  THESE MASSACRES HAVE HAD A HUGE REGIONAL 
IMPACT AND HAVE HURT THE US, WHICH HAS LOST A LOT OF ITS 
ARAB-WORLD, SEPTEMBER 11TH SYMPATHY.  BUT THE PEOPLE CAN BE 
LED BEYOND ANTI-US FEELINGS, NOT BY FORCE, BUT BY POLITICAL 
DISCUSSION, AND THIS IS WHERE A BILATERAL US-SYRIAN DIALOGUE 
CAN BE VERY HELPFUL.  WHEN THE US ADMINISTRATION IS \'IN THE 
PICTURE,\' IT CAN ACT CORRECTLY AND WILL GET REGIONAL SUPPORT. 
 THEREFORE, BILATERAL US-SYRIAN DIALOGUE IS MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN ANY CONFERENCE INITIATIVE.  ASAD SAID HE KNEW OF THE 
INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC LOBBIES, AND THAT THE ARABS WERE NOT 
DOING THEIR JOB IN LOBBYING OR PRESENTING A TRUE PICTURE TO 
CONGRESS. 
 
14. (C) CONGRESSMAN PRICE SAID THAT BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS AND 
THIS CONFERENCE WERE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.  HE KNEW THE 
APPARENT DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE US ADMINISTRATION WERE 
CAUSING PROBLEMS GLOBALLY.  BUT SEPTEMBER 11TH HAD BEEN A 
\'WAKE-UP CALL\' FOR PRESIDENT BUSH, AND NOW HE SHOULD BE TAKEN 
AT HIS WORD CONCERNING HIS DESIRE FOR A LASTING PEACE. 
SECRETARY POWELL IS THE PRESIDENT\'S EMISSARY AND SPEAKS 
AUTHORITATIVELY ON HIS BEHALF.  THEY BOTH NEED SYRIA\'S HELP. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
15. (C) RESPONDING TO WAYNE OWENS\' QUESTION ON HIS VIEWS 
CONCERNING US ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, ASAD REPEATED HIS STANDARD 
LINE THAT THE ONLY ACTION ACCEPTABLE WAS IMPLEMENTING UN 
RESOLUTIONS.  WHAT THE US WAS CONTEMPLATING WOULD NOT WORK, 
AND THE US NEEDED TO SERIOUSLY RECONSIDER ITS PLANS.  THE US 
SHOULD CONSULT WITH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION; OTHERWISE, THE 
US LOSES.  THE US ERROR LAY IN THINKING THAT MILITARY POWER 
COULD SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. 
 
16. (C) PRICE AGREED THAT VP CHENEY SHOULD HAVE COME TO 
SYRIA.  HE ALSO AGREED THAT US MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
WAS LIKELY.  HE TOLD ASAD THAT, WHILE HE STRONGLY BELIEVED 
THAT THIS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT, IRAQ POSED A REAL WMD 
THREAT.  PRICE EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THERE WERE 
INTERMEDIATE STEPS TO TAKE BEFORE MILITARY ACTION.  ALTHOUGH 
THIS WAS HIS OWN VIEW, MANY IN THE CONGRESS SHARED IT. 
 
----------------------- 
ASAD\'S LETTER TO BUSH 
----------------------- 
 
17. (C) COMMENTING THAT ASAD\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUSH 
FOLLOWING 9/11 HAD BEEN IMPORTANT, OWENS SUGGESTED THAT 
ANOTHER SUCH LETTER, COMMENTING ON THE GOOD THINGS THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE THUS FAR, WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL.  ASAD 
SAID THAT HE WAS SURE THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID TODAY WOULD 
SIMILARLY BE RELAYED UPWARDS, SO THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD 
REACH THE PRESIDENT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. (COMMENT: DESPITE 
REPEATED PROBING, ASAD GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THAT HE WOULD 
BE WILLING TO ISSUE A STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL US 
POLICY, EITHER PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
ARAFAT TOOTHLESS, REGION INFLAMED, SYRIA WILL WAIT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
18. (C) IN RESPONSE TO PRICE\'S OBSERVATION THAT NEWLY-FREED 
ARAFAT FACED A MAJOR TEST IN STEMMING PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE, 
ASAD ASKED RHETORICALY WHAT MEANS WERE LEFT FOR ARAFAT TO DO 
ANYTHING?  PRICE REPLIED THAT ASAD HAD A POINT.  HOWEVER, HE 
WAS CONCERNED - THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WERE CRITICAL, BUT 
HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT SYRIA COULD BE OF MAXIMUM ASSISTANCE. 
POWELL HAD TOLD ARAFAT THAT HE WAS DOWN TO HIS LAST CHANCE; 
THERE WAS A DESPERATE QUALITY IN THE AIR.  WHAT DID PRESIDENT 
ASAD THINK FRIENDS OF THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD DO? 
 
19. (C) ASAD REPEATED THAT ARAFAT COULD DO NOTHING.  HE HAS 
NO POLICE, NO PRISON, AND THE ISRAELIS HAD EVEN KILLED HIS 
COOK.  BUT EVEN BEFORE THESE WERE STRIPPED FROM HIM, HE WAS 
POWERLESS.  THE INTIFADA WAS THE DE FACTO REALITY THAT ALL 
HAD TO DEAL WITH.  ALTHOUGH ARAFAT HAD EMERGED FROM HIS 
LATEST ORDEAL WITH A HEROIC AURA, IN THE LAST THREE DAYS HE 
HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO BE AN ACTOR.  SYRIA HAS KNOWN FOR 
THIRTY YEARS THAT HE IS A LIAR.  HE HASN\'T CHANGED; THE US 
DISCOVERED HIS NATURE TOO LATE.  HE HAD MISLED THE US 
CONCERNING HIS ABILITIES AT A TIME WHEN \'NINETY PERCENT\' OF 
THE SITUATION WAS OUTSIDE HIS CONTROL.  EVEN HIS IMMEDIATE 
CIRCLE HAS REBELLED AGAINST HIM.  ALTHOUGH SYRIA EXPECTS 
NOTHING FROM HIM, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.  WHO IS THERE IF 
ARAFAT FALLS? - NOBODY. 
 
20. (C) AS FOR THE FUTURE, ASAD DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. 
\'WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED WHEN THE ISRAELIS KILL THE MOTHER AND 
BROTHER OF A PERSON WHO THEN HAS TO STAY IN THE SAME ROOM 
WITH THE DEAD BODIES FOR TWELVE HOURS?\'  ISRAEL HAD KILLED 
\'SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE\' IN JENIN AND NABLUS, AND HAS NOW PRIMED 
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO EXPLODE. 
 
21. (C) CONTINUING, ASAD SAID \'WE CAN ALL EXPECT THE WORST, 
AND WE ALL WILL PAY FOR SHARON, WHO HAS DELAYED THE PEACE 
PROCESS UNTIL PEOPLE FORGET THESE ATROCITIES.\'  MUCH AS THE 
HORROR OF SEPTEMBER 11 WILL LONG REMAIN FRESH IN AMERICA\'S 
MIND, SO TOO WILL THESE RECENTLY INFLICTED HORRORS LONG 
REMAIN IN PALESTINIAN AND ALL ARAB MINDS. 
 
22. (C) THE US WAS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE IT DID NOT 
STAND AGAINST SHARON AND THE PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY, ASAD 
MAINTAINED.  THE ADMINISTRATION\'S PERFORMANCE WAS SO WEAK 
WITH REGARDS TO ISRAEL THAT MANY PALESTINIANS CAME TO BELIEVE 
THAT FIGHTING WAS THE ONLY SOLUTION.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE US 
WAS THAT IT ONLY LOOKED FOR A SOLUTION AFTER THE PROBLEM HAD 
GOTTEN OUT OF HAND.  THE PICTURE WAS BLACK, AND FOR NOW, 
SYRIA WOULD WAIT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
ASAD: \"OFF THE RECORD, I CAN SAY I WANT PEACE... 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
23. (C) ASAD SAID THAT \'OFF THE RECORD, I CAN SAY I WANT 
PEACE, BUT I CAN\'T TELL THAT TO THE MEDIA, BECAUSE \'NO ONE 
WANTS TO HEAR IT.\'  HE REPEATED THAT THE SITUATION WAS STILL 
VERY EMOTIONAL, AND THAT SYRIA WOULD WAIT FOR EMOTIONS TO 
COOL, AT WHICH TIME IT COULD DISCERN THE UNDERLYING 
REALITIES.  THE PRESENT TIME WAS ONE OF PARALYSIS, EVEN IN 
THOUGHT, \'BECAUSE THE ELEMENTS WERE NOT STABLE, AND THEREFORE 
THE RESULTS NOT ACCURATE.\'  THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT A CALL FOR 
PESSIMISM.  ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE DELAY, THE PEACE PROCESS 
EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE TO RESUME. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ISRAEL KILLS SYRIAN CROWN PRINCE INITIATIVE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
24. (C) PRICE ASKED IF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S PEACE 
INITIATIVE WERE A WAY FORWARD.  ASAD ANSWERED THAT SYRIA HAD 
SUPPORTED IT, WHICH HAD GIVEN IT LEGITIMACY.  WITHIN THE ARAB 
WORLD IT WAS SEEN AS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.  BUT TWO DAYS AFTER 
THE ARAB SUMMIT, SHARON STARTED HIS MASSACRES.  SYRIA HAD 
GIVEN LIFE TO THE CROWN PRINCE\'S INITIATIVE; SHARON HAD 
KILLED IT TWO DAYS LATER. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ASAD: WE ARE THE PEACE PROCESS 
-------------------------------- 
 
25. (C) ASAD AGREED THAT SYRIA\'S ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS 
WAS KEY, SINCE \'IF SYRIA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PEACE PROCESS, 
WHO IS?\'  EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ALREADY SIGNED AGREEMENTS: 
SYRIA IS THE WHOLE PARTY, AND OTHERS SHOULD PLAY A SUPPORTING 
ROLE.  ASAD IN TURN ASKED PRICE HOW THE US ADMINISTRATION 
COULD ANNOUNCE THAT THEY WERE SENDING PEOPLE TO THE REGION TO 
DISCUSS PEACE, AND HAVE THESE PEOPLE AVOID SYRIA. 
 
26. (C) IN CLOSING, ASAD SAID HE WAS PLEASED WITH THIS 
DIALOGUE AND WITH CONGRESSMAN PRICE\'S COMMENTS.  HE ASKED 
CONGRESSMAN PRICE TO SEND HIS BEST REGARDS TO PRESIDENT BUSH. 
 
27. (U) THIS CABLE WAS NOT CLEARED WITH CONGRESSMAN PRICE. 
 
28. (C) COMMENTS: ASAD SEEMED RELAXED AND A BIT MORE 
REFLECTIVE THAN IN SOME OTHER MEETINGS.  FOR ONCE, HE DID 
IMPLICITLY CLAIM TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.  MUCH OF WHAT HE 
SAID WE\'VE ALREADY HEARD: CHASTISING THE US FOR ITS PERCEIVED 
ABSENCE; CALLING FOR GREATER BILATERAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION; DECRYING SHARON\'S TOXIC EFFECT ON THE PEACE 
PROCESS; AND CRITICIZING US PLANS TO \'BRING DOWN\' SADDAM. 
NEW, ALTHOUGH EXPECTED, WAS HIS SKEPTICISM TOWARDS A PROPOSED 
SUMMER PEACE CONFERENCE AND HIS RELUCTANCE TO CONSIDER A 
LETTER OF SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT BUSH.  CONCERNING THE 
SHARON-ARAFAT STRUGGLE, HE SEEMED AT A GENUINE LOSS AS TO 
WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY SURE THAT, GIVEN 
ARAFAT\'S IMPOTENCE AND POPULAR PALESTINIAN RAGE, IT WOULD NOT 
BE GOOD.  WE TAKE ASAD AT HIS WORD THAT GIVEN THE ENFLAMED 
AND DYNAMIC REGIONAL SITUATION, SYRIAN POLICY WILL MOVE 
TOWARD ITS TRADITIONAL DEFAULT OF \'WAITING,\' WHILE PLAYING TO 
THE ARAB STREET.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TFIZO1:SYRIA CLOSES BORDER AND SAYS IT WILL SET UP 
 
REFUGEE CAMPS ON IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR THEODORE H. KATTOUF FOR REASONS 1.5B/D 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY. SARG MINISTER OF LOCAL AFFAIRS CONVENED UN/IO 
REPS AT 23:00 ON MARCH 19 TO INFORM THEM THE BORDER WITH IRAQ 
HAD CLOSED, BUT THAT THE SARG AND THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT 
WOULD SET UP THREE REFUGEE CAMPS IN IRAQI TERRITORY OR THE 
\"NO MAN\'S LAND BETWEEN THE TWO BORDERS.\"  HE STATED THAT THE 
SARG WOULD PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE CAMPS (DIRECTLY 
CONTRADICTING STATEMENTS MADE BY DFM MU\'ALLIM TO AMBASSADOR 
THE MORNING OF MARCH 19, SEE PARA 3), UPON WHICH UN REPS 
QUESTIONED THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SENDING SYRIAN 
MILITARY/SECURITY ELEMENTS INTO IRAQ AT THIS TIME.  YASIN 
ASKED FOR RELIEF MATERIALS AND HELP DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE 
AT THE CAMPS. HE SAID THE SARG IS WILLING TO ALLOW TCNS IF 
UNHCR WILL RECEIVE THEM AT ITS EL HOL REFUGEE CAMP. THE UN 
DOUBTS THE SARG/RED CRESCENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO A 
REFUGEE CRISIS ALONE. THE UN/IO COMMUNITY WAS TAKEN BY 
SURPRISE BY THE SARG\'S REVERSAL AND IS SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE 
OUT WHAT\'S NEXT. THERE DOES NOT YET APPEAR TO BE A LARGE 
NUMBER OF REFUGEE SEEKERS AT THE BORDER. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) AT 23:00 ON MARCH 19, SARG MINISTER OF LOCAL AFFAIRS 
SALAH YASIN CONVOKED REPRESENTATIVES FROM UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, 
IOM, AND ICRC TO CONVEY THE SARG\'S POSITION ON REFUGEES AND 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID: 
 
-- THE SARG, ALREADY BURDENED BY PALESTINIAN AND GOLAN 
REFUGEES, HAD CLOSED ITS BORDERS AND WOULD KEEP THEM CLOSED 
FOR THE DURATION OF HOSTILITIES. 
 
-- SYRIA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. 
WITH THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT AND INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF 
RED CROSS/RED CRESCENT (IFRC) THE SARG WILL ESTABLISH THREE 
CAMPS 8-10 KILOMETERS INTO IRAQ NEAR THE THREE MAJOR BORDER 
CROSSINGS OF AL TANF (SOUTH), ABU KAMAL (CENTRAL), AND 
YAROBIAH (NORTH). 
 
-- THE SARG WOULD ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE CAMPS (THIS 
DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED WHAT DFM MU\'ALLIM TOLD AMBASSADOR THE 
MORNING OF MARCH 19, SEE PARA 3). 
 
-- THE SARG WOULD ALLOW TCNS INTO THE COUNTRY IF UNHCR WOULD 
RECEIVE THEM AT ITS EL HOL REFUGEE CAMP. 
 
-- THE SARG HOPED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD PROVIDE 
SUPPLIES (TENTS, SHELTER FACILITIES, FOOD) AND ASSISTANCE 
DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE (WATER, ELECTRICITY, SANITATION). 
 
-- NO GROUND HAD BEEN BROKEN ON ANY OF THE CAMPS, BUT THE 
SARG THOUGHT THEY COULD BE READY IN A WEEK AND HAVE A 
CAPACITY OF 100,000 IF ALL PARTIES COOPERATED. 
 
3. (S) CONFLICTING MESSAGES FROM SARG ON CROSS-BORDER RELIEF: 
CONTACTS WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 20 
THEY WERE ASTONISHED BY THE SARG\'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WOULD 
SET UP CAMPS IN IRAQI TERRITORY. THEY IMMEDIATELY ASKED WHO 
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY AND IF THE SARG HAD 
FULLY CONSIDERED THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN 
ACTION. YASIN REPLIED THAT SYRIAN \"ELEMENTS\" WOULD ENSURE 
SECURITY FOR THE CAMPS. (NOTE: THIS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED 
WHAT SARG DFM WALID MU\'ALLIM TOLD THE AMBASSADOR EARLIER THE 
SAME DAY: THAT SYRIA COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
SECURITY OF ANY REFUGEES, SINCE IT WOULD NOT KNOW WHO THEY 
WERE; THAT SYRIAN MILITARY FORCES WOULD NOT LEAVE SYRIA AND 
THEIR PURPOSE WOULD BE TO PREVENT REFUGEES FROM ENTERING 
SYRIA; AND THAT ONLY HUMANITARIAN WORKERS, SYRIAN RED 
CRESCENT AND AFFILIATED UN/NGO, WOULD CROSS THE BORDER TO 
ASSIST THE REFUGEES AND PROVIDE SUPPLIES. END NOTE.) YASIN 
REPORTEDLY SIDESTEPPED THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL 
IMPLICATIONS, BUT BACKTRACKED ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE 
CAMPS, SAYING THAT THEY MIGHT BE LOCATED IN THE \"NO MAN\'S 
LAND\" BETWEEN THE TWO BORDERS (WHICH THE UN DOES NOT BELIEVE 
LEGALLY EXISTS.) 
 
4. (C) RED CRESCENT IN CHARGE, NOT A GOOD THING: YASIN MADE 
IT CLEAR THAT THE RED CRESCENT (WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE IFRC) 
WOULD TAKE THE LEAD ON CROSS-BORDER REFUGEE RELIEF, A 
PROSPECT THAT EMBASSY INTERLOCUTORS CONTEMPLATED WITH 
SOMETHING AKIN TO DREAD. UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM, AND ICRC HAVE 
LONG EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE RED CRESCENT\'S CAPACITY TO 
DEAL WITH A REFUGEE CRISIS. UN STAFF AND RED CRESCENT 
PRESIDENT DR. ATTAR \"HAVE NOT BEEN ON SPEAKING TERMS FOR 
MONTHS,\" SAID ONE UN REPRESENTATIVE. ANOTHER CONTACT SAID 
ATTAR, A PROMINENT AND WELL-CONNECTED BUSINESSMAN, HAD AN EGO 
IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO HIS EXPERIENCE OR ABILITIES. EVEN 
WITH THE EXPERTISE AND MATERIAL ASSISTANCE OF THE IFRC, MOST 
FELT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE RED CRESCENT WAS UP TO THE 
TASK. AN IOM OFFICIAL SAID, ONLY HALF-JOKINGLY, THAT THE ONLY 
WAY THE RED CRESCENT COULD HANDLE THE SITUATION WAS IF SYRIA 
DEPLOYED ITS ENTIRE ARMY TO ASSIST. 
 
5. (C) NO REFUGEES, BUT TCN\'S POSSIBLE: YASIN CONFIRMED THAT 
NO/NO REFUGEES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CROSS THE BORDER, BUT SAID 
THE SARG WOULD ALLOW TCNS TO ENTER SYRIA PROVIDED UNHCR WOULD 
RECEIVE THEM AT EL HOL. UNHCR, WHO MANAGES EL HOL AND IS NOT 
MANDATED TO TAKE CARE OF TCNS, AND UNICEF, WHO HAS DONE MOST 
OF THE CAMP\'S INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, WERE (INITIALLY, AT 
LEAST) OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF ALLOWING TCNS AT EL HOL. IOM 
DOES NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATE SITE TO HOUSE THE 3,000 TCNS 
EXPECTED AND IS NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THEM WITHOUT 
COOPERATION FROM UNHCR AND OTHER UN AGENCIES. 
 
6. (C) UN IN DISARRAY/NEXT STEPS: A GENUINELY SURPRISED UN/IO 
COMMUNITY, WHICH APPEARS NOT TO HAVE QUESTIONED THE SARG\'S 
ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD KEEP THE BORDERS OPEN DESPITE ITS 
LACK OF PREPARATION AND COMMUNICATION, IS NOW SCRAMBLING TO 
CLARIFY THE SARG\'S POSITION AND REORGANIZE. 
 
-- UNHCR APPEARS TO BE HOLDING OUT HOPE THE SARG WILL REVERSE 
ITS POSITION AND HAS BEEN IN NON-STOP MEETINGS WITH SARG 
OFFICIALS. ON MARCH 20, THE MFA DENIED UNHCR PERMISSION TO 
SEND OBSERVERS TO THE BORDER CROSSINGS TO ASSESS THE 
SITUATION AND TOLD UNHCR TO WAIT UNTIL AN OFFICIAL SARG 
ANNOUNCEMENT RE REFUGEE/HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WAS RELEASED 
(TO BE EXPECTED IN 2-3 DAYS). UNHCR IS OPPOSED TO, BUT STILL 
CONSIDERING, THE QUESTION OF TCNS AT EL HOL. 
 
-- ICRC HAS KICKED DECISION-MAKING UP TO GENEVA AND IS 
MEETING WITH THE (NEWLY ESTABLISHED) IFRC DELEGATION WHILE 
AWAITING THE RETURN OF THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT PRESIDENT FROM 
GENEVA TO COORDINATE THE MOVEMENT\'S POSITION. IN ANTICIPATING 
FUTURE COOPERATION WITH THE SARG, ICRC IS NOT HEARTENED BY 
THE FACT THAT AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATING, IT HAS STILL NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO BRING NON-FOOD ITEMS FOR 20,000 INTO SYRIA FROM 
AQABA. 
 
-- IOM IS NEGOTIATING WITH UNHCR REGARDING THE TCN ISSUE AND 
IS SURREPTITIOUSLY SENDING STAFF TO THE BORDERS. 
 
-- WFP, WHICH HAD CONCENTRATED MUCH OF ITS PLANNING ON 
CROSS-BORDER FOOD DISTRIBUTION IS THE LEAST AFFECTED BY THE 
POLICY CHANGE AND IS SITTING TIGHT. 
 
7. (C) NO LARGE BACK-UP AT BORDER, YET: INFORMATION IS STILL 
SKETCHY ABOUT THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER, AS UN AGENCIES 
HAVE BEEN DENIED OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO TRAVEL THERE.  BUT 
ANECDOTAL REPORTS AND A SURVEY OF THE UN/IO COMMUNITY SUGGEST 
THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO MORE THAN 100-200 REFUGEE SEEKERS AT 
THE OFFICIAL IRAQI/SYRIAN BORDER CROSSINGS. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: GIVEN LOCAL AFFAIRS MINISTER YASIN\'S POSITION 
OUTSIDE INNER SARG DECISION-MAKING CIRCLES, WE DOUBT THAT HIS 
STATEMENT OF SARG INTENT TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR CAMPS INSIDE 
IRAQ IS ACCURATE.  AMBASSADOR KATTOUF QUESTIONED DFM MU\'ALLIM 
CLOSELY ON THIS POINT, AND MU\'ALLIM WAS VERY CLEAR. HOWEVER, 
YASIN\'S DISJOINTED PRESENTATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
COMMUNITY IS TROUBLING, AND REFLECTS SARG DISARRY AS IT 
SCRAMBLES TO DEAL WITH THE US-LED ATTACK ON IRAQ. GIVEN THE 
LIMITED CAPABILITIES OF THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT (DESPITE 
SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE FROM THE IFRC) IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
IMAGINE CAMPS BEING SET UP WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT NGO 
INVOLVEMENT. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ASAD: HOW DO WE TURN THIS AROUND? 
 
Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Gene A. Cretz 
(Releasable to Former NEA A/S Richard Murphy) 
 
1.  (C) Summary. During a 90-minute one-on-one meeting on 
November 30, Syrian President Asad asked former NEA A/S 
Richard Murphy for advice on what could be done to improve 
US-Syrian relations and how Asad could expand his contacts 
with US media.  (Asad had just completed his interview with 
the NY Times Neil McFarquhar, published December 1).  Murphy 
urged Asad to publicly support Iraqi stability and efforts to 
move the peace process forward.  Asad acknowledged that Syria 
shared the US goal of a stable and prosperous Iraq and 
America\'s goal of returning full sovereignty to Iraq as soon 
as possible.  He expressed doubts about US resolve to pursue 
the Road Map in an election year.  Murphy also urged that the 
SARG resolve the Murad child abduction case.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Former NEA Assistant Secretary Richard Murphy visited 
Damascus November 29-December 1 as part of a regional visit 
that will also include Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the 
UAE.  This message conveys Ambassador Murphy\'s report to the 
Charge and Pol/C on his one-on-one meeting with Syrian 
President Asad on November 30.  Septels report Murphy\'s 
meeting with FM Shara, and a separate meeting with the new 
Syrian Prime Minister, Naji Al-Utri, which the Charge also 
attended. 
 
3. (C) REACHING US AUDIENCES: Having just finished an 
interview with the New York Times (published December 1), 
Asad asked for advice on expanding his contacts with the US 
media.  He seemed pleased with the NY Times\' interview, but 
noted that the paper reached only \"the elites.\"  What were 
other vehicles?  Asad had considered granting CNN\'s 
Christiane Amanpour\'s request for an interview, but felt she 
was not widely watched in the US.  His next interview would 
be with ABC\'s Peter Jennings, which he thought would reach a 
wider audience.  How should he contact other journalists? 
Should he do his interviews in English?  Should he do a human 
interest story? Murphy advised using Syrian Charge Imad 
Mustafa to contact the US press for as many interviews as he 
could, and that they be conducted in English as much as 
possible.  Discussing his family and personal interests was a 
good idea; the late King Hussein had built goodwill in the US 
and Israel through such outreach. 
 
4.  (C) BILATERAL RELATIONS:  Asad appeared concerned about 
the deterioration in relations with the US:  what can we do 
about it?  Murphy observed that while Syria had long been 
unpopular in Washington circles and with US public opinion, 
the frustration and irritation that had characterized 
relations had turned to anger over Syria\'s shipment of 
dual-use items and facilitation of volunteer fighters to 
Iraq.  Asad said these activities had stopped, and maintained 
Syria was now trying to cooperate.  Murphy said he understood 
that Syria was doing relatively well with controlling its 
border and there had been some cooperation over the Iraqi 
assets issue.  He asked Asad whether he thought the US and 
Syria had a common interest in a stable and prosperous Iraq. 
Yes, Asad replied.  Did Syria agree that the Coalition ought 
to transfer authority to an Iraqi government as soon as 
possible?  Asad responded that this was indeed Syria\'s 
position.  If this was the case, Murphy advised, then Syria 
needed to say so.  Syria should specifically and publicly 
demonstrate its willingness to play a constructive role 
through positive statements in support of efforts to 
stabilize and rebuild Iraq.  Asad insisted that Syria was 
doing what it could on the border and other issues, including 
Iraqi assets in Syrian banks and said that a US Army team 
would be visiting \"next week\" to discuss border security. 
 
5.  (C) SUPPORTING PEACE EFFORTS:  Murphy also suggested that 
Syria play a more constructive role in support of efforts to 
achieve regional peace.  The signing of a symbolic peace 
agreement negotiated by former Israeli and Palestinian 
officials in Geneva on Dec 1 presented an opportunity for the 
SARG to affirm its commitment to peace.  Asad protested that 
he hadn\'t read the agreement, and that it had nothing to do 
with Syria.  Murphy rejoined that Syria didn\'t need to know 
what was in the text, and didn\'t have to support it, but it 
should find a way to applaud the efforts of those who seek 
peace.  This particular agreement might not deal specifically 
with Syria but it did deal with restoring hope for peace, 
which did concern Syria.  Asad seemed receptive to this 
notion, though he did not go so far as to agree that he ought 
to publicly commend such efforts.  Indicating one concern 
underlying his lack of enthusiasm, Asad asked Murphy for his 
views on what the US government would be doing in the coming 
year on the peace process.  How serious would the US be? 
Murphy predicted that the USG would stand by the Road Map, 
but might not offer any further initiatives in the coming 
months, noting that its expectations had been dampened by Abu 
Mazen,s resignation.  But the Road Map wasn\'t a vision, Asad 
protested.  Perhaps not, Murphy said, but it supported a 
comprehensive peace and laid out specific, practical 
requirements to achieve an Israeli/Palestinian settlement. 
 
6.  (C) DEALING WITH OBSTACLES:  Murphy asked Asad for his 
view of Hizballah and its intentions vis-a-vis a peace 
settlement.  Hassan Nasrallah, Asad replied, dresses like a 
religious man, but he is really an excellent politician whose 
basic interest is building an effective political party in 
Lebanon.  Their interest is in liberating Lebanon, not in 
attacking Israel.  Asad gave no ground on Murphy\'s point that 
according to the UN, all of Lebanon\'s territory had been 
liberated and that continued insistence that Shaba Farms was 
part of Lebanon was not consistent with UNSCR 425.  Only 
Lebanon and Syria had the right to say which country owned 
Sheb,a.  Beirut and Damascus agreed it was Lebanese 
territory.  Murphy noted the statements by Hizballah leaders 
calling for the liberation of Jerusalem.  Asad asserted that 
such statements were rhetorical only and ought not to be 
taken seriously.  Hadn\'t the Blue Line remained quiet?  Why 
had the Blue Line remained quiet, Murphy queried.  Was it due 
to Syria, Iran or Hizballah,s own self-discipline?  Asad 
replied that while Syria supported keeping the Blue Line 
calm, it was Hizballah,s decision.  He charged that the 
Israeli provocations, intended to maintain tension among 
Israelis, were largely responsible for any incidents that 
occurred.  The IDF overflew Lebanese territory, Hizballah 
responded with \"symbolic gestures\" of defense by firing 57mm 
AAA, and Israelis near the border went into their air 
shelters. 
 
7. (U) MURAD: Murphy asked the President what progress had 
been made in locating the abducted children of Mrs. Elizabeth 
Henry, whose former husband was known to have taken the 
children from Lebanon to Syria.  Asad said he was well aware 
of the case and that he had instructed his Minister of 
Interior to personally take charge of the matter. 
Regrettably, the Syrian authorities did not know where Mr. 
Murad was.  Asad asked whether the USG might not provide 
additional information to assist the Syrian authorities in 
their efforts to track down Murad.  Murphy said he would 
convey this request, but urged that the SARG redouble its 
efforts.  It was very difficult to believe that Murad could 
not be found. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT: This was Ambassador Murphy\'s second meeting 
with Asad (the first was in April 2002) who, despite the 
ongoing crisis in relations, seemed relaxed, focused and 
confident enough to conduct the entire meeting in English 
(asking his interpreter for help with just three words). 
 
9.  (U) Ambassador Murphy cleared this message. 
 
10. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

SUBJECT: HAMAS LEADER REJECTS US INDICTMENT 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reasons 1.4b/d. 
 
1. (C) In an August 21 interview with the Associated Press, 
Moussa Abu Marzouk, Deputy Chairman of Hamas\' politbureau, 
responded to the announcement of his indictment by US 
Attorney General John Ashcroft for conspiring to fund terror 
attacks against Israel by saying that he would turn himself 
in to US authorities if he were assured access to \"fair and 
evenhanded justice.\"  He went on to add that this seemed 
unlikely to him since \"American justice is absent now.\"  He 
also denied that Hamas is a terrorist group and dismissed the 
possibility of Syria extraditing him since, \"No one in the 
region, including Syria, considers Hamas or the Palestinian 
struggle (against Israel) as terrorist.\"  The Damascus AP 
correspondent Albert Aji (protect) told poloff that he 
interviewed Marzouk in person in Damascus and that Marzouk 
had told him \"there is no justice for Arabs in the US after 
9/11\".  Marzouk also told the AP correspondent that this is 
an \"old story\" from 1989 and the Justice Department reopened 
the case as a public relations move to bolster the Bush 
administration\'s reelection campaign.  (Note: Marzouk, who 
lived for 15 years in US and completed a PHD in industrial 
engineering, was expelled to Jordan 1995.  He currently lives 
between Syria and Lebanon.  End Note.) 
 
2. (U) The advisor to the Syrian Information Minister Haj Ali 
told the Saudi media outlet Al Riyad that Syria would not 
hand over Marzouk.  \"Syria does not accept dictates or 
condition and does not accept others issuing prior conditions 
and saying you have to do this and that.\"  He added that 
Syria has enough strength to \"refuse any subjugation to the 
will and conditions of others.\"  Haj Ali said he believes the 
US will escalate the situation but that escalation will not 
lead to any results and added that the US should adopt 
dialogue with Syria.  He also said that the US issuance of 
the arrest warrant at this time and through representative 
institutions, i.e. through the Attorney General, was 
deliberate and aimed at exerting pressure on Syria on the 
basis that Abu Marzouk resides there.  The advisor to the 
Information Minister also said that the resistance in 
Palestine and Iraq was legitimate.  He denied that 
Palestinian groups in Damascus were participating in the 
resistance against Israel and asserted that Palestinian 
groups in Damascus had normal offices that had no ties to the 
Palestinian domestic arena and did not have the means to 
carry our operations as the US claimed.

SUBJECT: HAMAS MEMBER TARGETED IN CAR BOMBING 
 
REF: DAMASCUS 5689 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen Seche, for reasons 1.4 b/d 
 
1.  (C) Summary: On December 13, a car bomb exploded in the 
Old Mezzeh section of Damascus, wounding some passers-by but 
apparently killing no one.  Media contacts confirmed that the 
target of the bombing was Mesbah Abu Hweileh, a Palestinian 
HAMAS official residing in Damascus.  Interior Minister Ghazi 
Kanaan appeared on Syrian television the evening of December 
13, claiming that the Mossad was behind the bombing.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  At approximately 1300 on December 13, a car bomb 
went off in the commercial district of Old Mezzeh, 
approximately 1.5 miles from the Embassy.  A number of 
passers-by were reportedly injured by flying glass, and 
Syrians present at the scene mentioned to both RSO and A/ARMA 
that a woman had been killed in the blast; however, no deaths 
have been confirmed by authorities or by the press. 
According to press contacts, the car belonged to HAMAS member 
Mesbah Abu Hweileh, who was in Old Mezzeh with his daughter 
and wife, on their way to a dentist appointment.  The bomb 
apparently detonated shortly after they had exited the 
vehicle. 
 
3.  (C) AP reporter Albert Aji told Poloff that he spoke to 
HAMAS\' deputy political bureau chief Moussa Abu Marzouk, who 
told Aji that he believed the Mossad organized the bombing. 
Interior Minister Ghazi Kanaan claimed as much in a statement 
that aired on Syrian television the evening of December 13 
and was picked up by all of the Arabic satellite stations. 
Comment: Kanaan\'s appearance on television immediately after 
the bombings to state the Syrian point of view is a departure 
from the normal veil of silence that ensues after major 
incidents of this sort, and may be a further indication of 
increasing SARG openness to a more liberal media environment. 
 End comment. 
 
4.  (C) Note: This is the second time a HAMAS official 
residing on Syrian soil has been targeted this year; on 
September 26, HAMAS leader Ezzedine Sheikh Khalil was killed 
in a car bombing (reftel). 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  While Israel has neither denied nor claimed 
responsibility for either incident, the target and timing of 
each could be indicative of a \"tit-for-tat\" approach on the 
part of Israel, which may be conducting operations in Syria 
in response to Palestinian attacks in the Territories.  The 
September 26 Khalil assassination, for example, came weeks 
after twin suicide bombings in southern Israel, while the 
December 13 Mezzeh car bomb incident came several days after 
the joint HAMAS/Fatah-orchestrated attack on an Israeli army 
outpost near Rafah on the Gaza-Egypt border.  End Comment.
